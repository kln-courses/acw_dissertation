Yet no comprehensive history of these influences has been written.1 Nothing exists for Ireland comparable to the histories of the classical tradition in France by Egger, in Germany by Bursian, in the Netherlands by Lucian M?ller, in Belgium by Roersch and in Spain by Rubio. It is true that several of the more famous early Irish classical scholars have been given honourable attention in general histories such as those by Sandys (who discusses the English tradition in detail) and Manitius. But in these their Irish provenance is often overlooked or obscured2 and the back ground of vernacular Irish literature almost entirely ignored. A similar state of neglect becomes evident when one examines the amount of basic research published in this field. Only the earlier period has had more than superficial attention, and even there some fundamental work has still to be undertaken. There is no dictionary of Hibernian Latin and no full list of Greek words found in Irish texts. A suggestion made over fifty years ago3 for publishing a complete library of the literary monumenta Hiberniae has not yet been officially sanctioned, though several important Latin documents have now been published in the Scriptores Latini Hiberniae series sponsored by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Comprehensive catalogues of classical antiquities collected or excavated in Ireland have yet to be provided. Classical influences on Irish literature, art, architecture, politics, and philosophy, have received only slight attention?and this in the country of Berkeley and Burke, Oscar Wilde and James Joyce, as well as of Eriugena and Sedulius Scottus. When one looks for reasons why the general history of so rich and varied a tradition has been so much neglected, two are immediately apparent. The first is linguistic. In most other countries the classical historian needs only to know one vernacular language. In Ireland he requires skill in at least two of the four vernaculars used in various epochs of Irish history. He will not need to master the Scandinavian language of the Norse rulers and burghers of the sea-port towns from the ninth to the eleventh centuries, since they left no literature. But ideally he should be expert in three others, Irish (old, middle, and modern), Norman French, and English (including old English), though in fact Norman French in Ireland does not offer much of interest for students of the classical tradition. 1 Madden's Some passages etc. is mainly confined to the sixteenth century. 2 For example J. C. Collins in his Greek influence on English poetry (London, 1910) 13 remarks on Eriugena 'as he was born and educated in Ireland he belongs to Great Britain'. Gilbert Highet in his Classical heritage (Oxford, 1949) mentions Columba and Eriugena under the heading /Anglo-Saxon prose'. Sandy's, A history etc. lists some purely Irish scholars in a chapter entitled 'England in the nineteenth century'. Obviously there are difficulties at times in deciding the national status of persons who have lived in more countries than one. In the present essay those who were born in Ireland, or born of Irish parents, or educated in Ireland, or resident in Ireland for a considerable time, are included, though several of these, from St. Patrick onwards, could also be reasonably claimed by other countries. 3 By Eoin MacKeill (then Minister for Education of the Irish Free State) in Studies xiii (1924) 186-8.</page><page sequence="3">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 15 During the century and a half since the revival of interest in the native language and literature of Ireland, there have in fact been able linguists of this kind, capable of surveying all or almost all of the tradition by themselves. But a psychological factor seems to have prevented them from attempting a full history. When classical scholars entered the then largely unexplored field of Celtic studies, they understandably became so much engrossed by its potentialities that they seldom, if ever, returned to the comparatively over-exploited territories of the Greek and Roman classics. As they rightly saw the situation, the prime thing to do was to publish and interpret the long lost basic material from the Irish medieval and modern documents. The alternative to a history by a single author was, of course, a work of collaboration between classicists and celticists. Unhappily, a political factor helped to prevent this. When Celtic studies became to some extent associated in the popular mind w|th Irish nationalism, classical scholars and Celtic scholars tended to move apart for a while. Occasionally there were acrimonious clashes between protagonists in the two traditions, as for example in the celebrated controversy between Mahaffy and Hyde. Unhappily, too, in Hiberno-Latin studies religious controversies hindered full co-operation between scholars of the divided churches, and charges of heresy kept some ancient Irish scholars, especially Eriugena, under a cloud. Now, however, in 1970, though the linguistic difficulty remains, full co operation in a complete history of classical influences in Ireland has become fully feasible as well as desirable. The National Committee for Greek and Latin Studies, established by the Royal Irish Academy in 1968, has decided that one of its major projects will be the production of such a work, together with the promotion of the necessary basic research. The project is still in its preliminary stages. The following necessarily superficial survey of the main topics is offered in the hope of eliciting contributions and suggestions from as wide a range of experts as possible. The ultimate questions to be answered are : What has the classical tradition done for the Irish, and what have the Irish done for the classical tradition? HIBERNO-LAT?N LITERATURE IN THE EARLY MEDIEVAL PERIOD This is the single epoch of Irish history in which olassical influences have been extensively discussed4?naturally, since Irish classical scholars were outstanding in western Europe during that time. The literary material begins with St. Patrick in his Confession and Letter to the soldiers of Coroticus and extends through the era of Columbanus to that of Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena. Thanks to the researches of Bieler, Bischoff, Courcelle, Esposito, Gougaud, Kenney, Laistner, Manitius, MacNeill, Rogers, Ryan, and others, the source-material has been frequently surveyed and analysed. 4 For an invaluable review of research on the early medieval period of Latin studies in Ireland from Ussher's Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquit?ten (Dublin, 1639) to 1963 see Bieler, Die lateinische etc. Bieler also gives a brief, but comprehensive account of the scholarship of this period in his Island etc. Esposito, Bibliography etc. lists the chief writers of the period.</page><page sequence="4">16 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The need now is for a full synoptic survey of all these scattered interpretations. Particular topics might also repay more detailed attention: for example, the cross-influences between Latin and vernacular Irish versification;5 the inter action of Latin and Irish syntax and vocabulary6 (including the vexed question of the Hisperica famina), the orthography7 and pronunciation8 of Latin and Greek in early medieval Ireland, and the varieties of early Irish palaeography.9 These have been much discussed already, but the definitive studies remain to be made. One instrument for research in this field is urgently required, namely a dictionary of insular Celtic Latinity. Plans for this are now being prepared by the National Committee, and Professor Bieler has consented to supervise its production. Some other aspects of this period might, perhaps, be further illuminated by co-operation between scholars and scientists, namely the scientific aspects 5 See, e.g., F. J. A. Raby, A history of secular Latin poetry in the middle ages (Cambridge. 1934) 1, 236 ff, E. Knott, Classical Irish poetry (Dublin, 1957) 11 ff, Bieler Island etc. 226, and F. J. Byrne, Latin etc. But A. M. Clark, Studies in literary modes (Edinburgh, 1946) 142-65 emphasises that the rhyming and assonantal elements in medieval Latin verse (see, e.g. Bernard, Irish Liber etc. ii, xiii ff) existed to some extent in classical Latin. Watkins 219 considers that the development of alliteration as a poetic device in Ireland must be very late in the prehistoric Irish period. Raby specially mentions as examples of Irish skill in Latin verse the elegiacs of Donatus of Fiesole, the hexameters, of Colman, and the macaronic verses of Eriugena. He admires the remarkable versatility of Sedulius who uses iambic, anapaestic, asclepiadic, sapphic, trochaic and dactylic rhythms. Laistner Thought etc. 335 calls Sedulius 'the most versatile metrical artist since Prudentius'. Sedulius's influence on goliardic poetry is emphasised by B. I. Jarcho in 'Die Vorl?ufer des Golias' (Speculum iii, 1928, 523-79): 'Sedulius ist der goliardus Karolinus par excellence*. Cf. n. 16 below. 6 See Bieler, Hibernian Latin, Hibernian Latin and patristics, and Die lateinische etc. 272-3, W. G. Most, 'The syntax of the Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae', Catholic University studies in medieval and renaissance language and literature xx (1946) 281-308 and 336-8, and nn. 14 and 19 below. Bernard and Atkinson, Irish Liber etc. ii, 144, list some peculiar words common to the Altus prosator and the Hisperica famina, noting a fondness in both works for coining nouns in -men, like fatimen. Meehan, Adamnaris etc. 18, finds 'Hisperic' words in Adamnan. Bieler, Humanism etc. 100 n. 13, notes a piece of 'Hisperie' syntax in Columbanus Ep. 5 (p. 177, 17-18), but believes that the Hisperica famina must be British: cf. Bieler, Hibernian etc. 93. Among those who think it is Irish are P. Grosjean {C?ltica iii, 1956, 35-85), F. J. H. Jenkinson (The Hisperica Famina, Cambridge, 1908, xi), and Chadwick. Roger, L'enseignement etc. 238 ff, believes it was written by an Irishman but not necessarily in Ireland. Most recently Michael Winterbottom in C?ltica viii (1968) 136-7 thinks it could have been written either in Ireland or in England. Bieler, Hibernian etc. 92-5, notes that the influence of Latin on Irish seems to have been stronger than the opposite. See also Gertrud Bruning on the style of Adamnan's Life of Columba in ZCP xi (1917) 237-44; she notes many classical echoes. 7 MacNeill, Beginnings etc. 39-48, discusses orthographic features of Latin loanwords in early Irish and argues for a strong British-Latin influence. 8 For some references to the pronunciation of Latin by early Irish scholars see Maria Bonioli, La pronuncia del latino nelle scuole dalV antichit? al Rinascimento, part 1 (Turin, 1962) pp. 77-8 (Latin c pronounced as k in Ireland) 90 (final t not pronounced as -d or -th in Ireland), 108 (on the pronunciation of s, on which see also M. H. Jellinek in Sitzber. Akad. Wiss. Wien, Phil. -hist. Kl. B. 212, Abh. 2 1930). Cf. H. Pedersen's Vergleichende Grammatik der Keltischen Sprachen (1909) passim. Cf. pp. 24-5 below. 9 For palaeographical research see Bieler, Die lateinische etc. 266-70. He notes that material is being collected for a work comparable to Lowe's studies on the Beneventan script. H. Meroney, 'Early Irish letter names' (Speculum xxiv, 1949, 19-43) mentions Greek and Roman influences on Irish alphabetical symbols. Bischoff, Das griechische etc. 33 ff, notes that the use of the IH!? and XP2 monograms are first found in Irish material. See Henry, Irish etc. 127 on Greek uncials in Irish MSS. A question which does not seem to have been considered in detail is how the Irish accentual sign ( ? Greek acute accent) was adopted to indicate a long vowel.</page><page sequence="5">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 17 of the Irish use of Graeco-Roman information on astronomy, mathematics (especially in calendarial calculations, the 'Computus'10) as evidenced in the writings of Cummian, Dicuil, Dunchad and Dungal, and geography in Adamnan and Dicuil11 (whose De mensura orbis terrae has been praised as a work of genuine merit) and in Virgil of Salzburg. The mythical geography of the heroic narratives, chronicles and folklore?e.g. in the Lebor Gab?la might also be taken into account here. A synoptic study of the Irish classical gram marians12 such as Aileran, Dicuil, Clemens Scottus, and Sedulius, might also be profitably undertaken. One general feature of Irish classical studies in contrast with those elsewhere in western Europe has often been noticed, but perhaps deserves repetition here. Though all the early Irish classical scholars were ecclesiastics?with the possible exception of Eriugena?their attitude towards the pagan authors showed none of the hostility that one finds among erudite Latin Christians such as Augustine and Jerome.13 The contrast is clearly to be seen in the writings of two contemporaries, Pope Gregory the Great and Columbanus.14 Gregory's view is illustrated in the remark in one of his letters15 that it would be better to make mistakes in grammar than to subject the divine oracles of holy scripture to the rules of pagan grammarians like Donatus (that favourite of Irish scholars), Columbanus revelled in classical rhetoric and metrics, and exploited varieties of Latin style varying from the 'hisperic' to the austere with evident delight and gusto. So, too, in the Irish attitude towards classical mythology and history; Irish Christians had no ancestral fears of the Graeco-Roman pantheon that was still worshipped sporadically in the sixth century in Greece and Italy. And because Irish information about classical matters was com paratively meagre, much of the sordid gossip and anti-pagan calumny that had accumulated round eminent classical figures was probably unknown. 10 For the 'Computus' see Kenney's index. 11 See Denis Meehan, Adamnaris etc., and J. J. Tierney Dicuili etc. and Beazley, The dawn etc., i, 229, 317-27. For sources see Bieler PRIA 64 0, 1 (1965) 1-31 (where see p. 2 for the opinion that 'Aethicus Ister' was Virgil of Salzburg). 12 See Kenney, index at Grammar, and Bieler, Die lateinische etc. Bongt Lofstodt, 'Der Hibernolateinische Grammatiker Malsachamis', Studia Latina Upsaliensia (Uppsala. 1965) gives a brief survey of other Irish grammarians.

Lat. v (1868) 599. On the Ars grammatica of Clemens Scottus see J. Tolkien in Philologies Supplementband xx, 3.(1928): he calls Clemens the most eminent grammarian after Alcuin in the time of Charlemagne, and describes his very wide sources. 13 For descriptions of conflicts in the minds of continental scholars torn between the Christian and the classical traditions see, e.g. Sandys i, 232, 235, 247-8, 504, 617-23, and Comparetti, Virgilio nel medio evo i, chaps. 6-9. 14 For recent views on Columbanus see Bieler, The humanism etc. and Christine Mohrmann, 'The earliest continental Irish Latin', Vigiliae Christianae xvi (1962) 216-33. 15 Gregory Epp. v, 53: cf. Sandys i, 443-5 for similar remarks of his. The 'Smaragdus' cited on this topic by E.H. Alton in H xciv (1960) 23 is no longer considered to be Irish: see Kenney 542-4. PROG. R.I.A., VOL. 70, SECT. C [Dl]</page><page sequence="6">18 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy So, for instance, when Columbanus mentioned Sappho as inclyta vates Troiugen aruml? he doubtless had no knowledge of the infamous slanders that had been attached to Sappho's name. Further, there was no memory in Ireland of a time when a ruling sovereign might?and, in the case of Julian, did? return to paganism. In other words, the classical tradition offered no serious threat to church or state, to manners or morals? in ancient Ireland (though a time would come later when some Irishmen would find inspiration for national independence in them). Besides these negative reasons why the Irish had no reason to fear or suspect the pagan classical heritage there were positive reasons for them to welcome and value it. As several Celtic scholars have emphasised,17 traditional respect for learning and poetry was strong in the old Gaelic order. The native scholars had an interest in linguistic matters18 that would make Latin and Greek vocabulary and grammar highly attractive to them. The poets with their similar interest in metrical and euphonic techniques would find the Graeco-Roman methods of poetic composition equally fascinating. And to a nation so fond of heroic narrative and imaginative fiction the classical myths and epics would offer a delightful new world for exploration. Besides, the fact that the native literary tradition was so strong and sophisticated saved the Irish from any over-reverential attitude to the formidable Graeco-Roman civilisation. As a result of this ?spirit of independence one constantly finds a readiness to adapt or alter classical materials to suit local conditions. At times, too, one encounters a charming mood of playfulness in Latin writings by Irishmen?frivola nostra, as Columbanus phrased it?which recaptures something like the tone of Catullus from the past and anticipates the gaiety of the goliardic poets of the future. Yet one must never forget?and to remem ber it gives piquancy to their lightness of heart and of style?that the early Irish Latinist s, despite their gay frivolity and their delight in linguistic virtuosity, differed profoundly from the dilettanti scholars of later Europe: their dominant motive was that of their deliberately unrhetorical predecessor, 16 I prefer the reading Troiugenarum to Graiugenarum as the lectio difficilior. Colum banus could have been misled by the references to Troy in the passage of Terentianus Maurus (De metris 2157 ff) from which he probably took his reference to Sappho. (The other explanation, that Columbanus took Lesbos to be part of Trojan territory seems less likely). For the use of adonics by Irish writers see B. Bischoff in Studien zur lateinischen Dichtung des Mittelalters, Ehrengabe f?r Karl Strecker (Dresden, 1931) 9. 17 See, e.g., Dillon Early etc. 171. For some evidence of quarrelling between Latin centred ecclesiastics and native Irish traditionalists see Flower, Irish etc. 44-7. For co-existence of the two traditions note the three schools, one of Latin learning, one of Irish law, one of Irish poetry, at Toomregan in 636: see Flower, Irish tradition 10-11. 18 On linguistic interests in the Irish bardic schools see Brian ? Cu?v, 'Linguistic' etc., 141-64: he suspends judgment on whether the poetic schools of the early period had any formal study of language (p. 155). For the bad effects of imposing the Latin grammatical system on Irish see Bergin, 'The native' etc.</page><page sequence="7">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 19 St. Patrick.19 It was essentially evangelical, pro Christo discere ac docere, and when they travelled abroad it was not in search of ancient manuscripts or erudite instructions: it was peregrinatio pro Dei amore. Here, perhaps, a glance at one Hiberno-Latin poem may serve to demon strate how the Irish mind found congenial means of expression in Latin. Sedulius' elegiac couplets On a sheep torn to pieces by a dog20 is an excellent example of playfulness mixed with pathos, Christian piety mixed with pagan ornamentation, mock heroics mixed with pastoral narrative, all enlivened with verbal wit and linguistic dexterity. Though purists can fault some of its lines as weak, as a whole it deserves an honoured place in any anthology of medieval Latin verse. The poet begins with a lofty description of the place of sheep in the cosmic order : Cum deus altipotens animalia condidit orbis, Quae mare, quae tellus, quae tenet atque polus: Multo multones tune multiplicavit honore, Inter balantes fecit eosque duces. Among this honoured tribe, we are told, outstanding in beauty and fatness, horns and woolliness, in brightness of eye and courage of heart, was the subject of the elegy : Hunc Aries caeli casto dilexit amore, Consortem regni hunc voluitque sui, Hunc Lucina potens niveo pro tegmine darum Sidus in excelsis poner? caelicolis .... Hunc meus arsit amor?nam nee mihi cornea fibra-?: Quis, nisi stultus, enim, qui nee amaret eum % But, alas, a robber seized this blameless and beautiful creature and tried to drag it away. Dogs, seeing the abduction, attacked the robber. He ran away, leaving the sheep behind. The dogs then attacked the sheep. To their astonishment the sheep fought back successfully: Obstupuere canes victi multone bieorni Atque leoninam rentur adesse feram. 19 On the Latin of St. Patrick see Bieler, 'The place of St. Patrick in Latin language and literature', Vigiliae Ghristianae vi (1952) 65-98, and Christine Mohrmann, Hie Latin of St. Patrick: four lectures (Dublin, 1961). It is generally agreed now that St. Patrick with 'his wearisome insistence on rusticitas* (Kuno Meyer, Learning oto. 1) was unlikely to have stimulated any Greek or classical Latin learning in Ireland. Most scholars now doubt that Patrick knew any Greek. But Edmund Hogan in The Irish Ecclesiastical Record viii (1887) 231-33 argued that the word exagellias in Confessio 14 is i(ayy \ta&lt;? (cf. 1 Peter 2, 9?10), with the implication that Patrick knew some New Testament Greek (Bieler in American Journal of Philology lxix (1948) 309-12 explains it differently); and R. S. Nicholson in Saint Patrick Apostle of Ireland in the third century (Dublin, 1868) 84 takes the statement in Patrick's letter to the soldiers of Coroticus, non mea verba sunt ista. sed Dei, et Apostolorum atque Prophetarum . . . guae ego in Latinum tranatuli, as indicating personal translations by Patrick from the Greek. For contacts of Irish with Greeks at Toul in the tenth century see Kenney 611. 20 Sedulius ii, 41 (L. Traube, Poetae Latini aevi Carolini iii, 204-7). For a recent appreciation of Sedulius' work see Carney in Old Ireland (ed. Robert McNally, Dublin, 1967) 228-50.</page><page sequence="8">20 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The sheep now addressed them with pious utterance, assuring them that he was a good sheep belonging to the Lord Hartgarius. They were appeased by his words, all except one villainous hound?a second Anubis or Cerberus? who denounced the sheep as an accomplice of the robber. The sheep attacked this accuser and routed him. But the dog treacherously crept up on the sheep from behind and killed it: Labitur exanimis multo (mirabile visu). Irrorans v?pres sanguine purpureo (like another Adonis). Now, as one would expect in a pastoral elegy, the Nymphs and flocks make lament. (But Sedulius slips a touch of wit into this conventional scene : the white moon also mourns, for is she not bicornis too ?) Turning to moralise on this tragical episode, Sedulius asks why should such a blameless creature die so cruelly: no deceiver he, nor drunkard, no glutton ; no liar, no robber ; not greedy for purple robes or fine horses : Non mendosus erat, nee inania verba loquutus: B?? seu b?? mystica verba dabat. (We may note in passing that Sedulius does not make the cityman's mistake of thinking that sheep have only one kind of bleat.) Now he sees in the death of this innocent victim a similarity with the sacrifice of the lofty-throned (Irish Latinists liked these compounds denoting loftiness21) Lamb of God, and with the ram who died as a surrogate for Isaac. Since Sedulius cannot now pray for the sheep, he prays for the robber and he hopes that this malefactor will live to sing the praise of God. The last lines express the poet's personal grief for the sheep? Heu quia nee vivurn te meus hortus habet. This is pastoral elegy in the tradition of Theocritus, but with a new and distinctive flavour, combining irony with compassion, mock-epic with pious hymnody. Even Ovid cannot command a wider variety of mood and tone, though obviously Sedulius' Latin cannot rival that master's. Yet how many histories of pastoral elegy from Theocritus to Keats and Arnold have ever noticed it? One other genre congenial to the Irish must only be briefly noticed, since to offer a specimen would put a severe strain on any modern typographer. This consists of the shape-poems, carmina fig?rala, by Joseph of Ireland to be found in Duemmler's collection of Carolingian Latin verses.22 In these the letters are arranged to make abstract, interwoven patterns, or to represent the fa?ade of a temple or church. In one of them the lines read horizontally left to right as hexameters, each with exactly the same number of letters, while parallelograms within the frame provide other hexameters. In others 21 E.g. (in Sedulius) celsitonantis (i, 5, et al.) celsithrono (i, 3, 2, et al.) altithronus (i 16, 20, et al.). In general, the remarkable proliferation of vivid compound epithets in Hiberno-Latin writings (in contrast with Augustan, but not with earlier, Latin poetry) deserves closer study: e.g. (in Sedulius) blandiloquax (i, 12, 10), hymnidicas (i, 20, 10), doctiloquax (ii, 1, 4), sereniflca (ii, 1, 41). 22 E. Duemmler, Poetae Latini aevi Carolini i (Berlin, 1881) 152-9. Professor Bieler has pointed out to me that carmina figurata were known to the Anglo-Saxons (and through them to the Carolingians, from the works of Optatianus Porfyrius), so that the Irish writers may have learned them in France.</page><page sequence="9">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 21 the internal hexameters form saltires or rectangles. In the temple shape-poem the columns and roof of the fa?ade read as four hexameters. These spectacular tours de force provide excellent illustrations of another Irish tendency in art and literature, that of reducing letters and words to elements in formal patterns whose principal effect is visual rather than literary?the tendency that reaches its zenith in the more elaborate pages of the Book of Kells. The same movement towards schematic formalisation affected another medium of art besides the visual. Just as the poets of the carmina figurata distorted their verbal material in order to make a striking effect on the eye of the reader, so poets like Sedulius sometimes went too far in subordinating the sense of their verses to the mere pleasure of sound. For instance in the poem already cited, the line multo multones tune multiplicavit honore could offend a fastidious ear by its double repetition of mult- and its emphatic assonance of o sounds. A more elaborate example from Sedulius, is : Quisquis Homerus amat hunc pulchro dicere versu Ac resonare mel? quisquis Homerus amat; Desinat Ule niger corvus, sit cignus amoenus, Per Phebi cyclos desinat Ule niger: Sit decus in populis doctus Maro, gloria Musae ; Orpheus atque novus sit decus in populis.2Z Here the schematic pattern, like some of the more elaborate designs in the Irish illuminated manuscripts, almost eclipses the content: the word-melody distracts the reader's attention from the meaning as at times in the work of Irish writers in Latin?a feature also to be found both in vernacular Irish poetry and in the versification of Anglo-Irish poets like Thomas Moore and Yeats (in his earlier work) and in the later prose of James Joyce.24 23 Sedulius ii, 6, 71-6 (Traube). He uses similar phrasal repetitions elsewhere, as e.g. in his poem to Ludewicus (Traube ii, 30, 33-4) : lilia pads amas bellorum mixta rosetis. Pectore Gaesareo lilia pads amas. A similar device is used in the poem on St. Brigid attributed to Cogitosus (but Esposito in H xlv, 1930, thinks it is from later than Cogitosus' time). 24 Some miscellaneous points are added here. A feature of the early medieval Hiberno-Latinists was their familiarity with Horace in a time when few others quoted him. In fact knowledge of Horace was, as Bieler has remarked (Humanism etc. 99), 'the hallmark of Hibernian classicism in the early middle ages'. Bieler adds that there is reason to believe that this knowledge was acquired in Ireland (Horace being practically unknown on the continent from the sixth to the eighth century) and from a study of the original works, not from textbooks on mythology or grammar. (Unfortunately no classical text has survived from the early period in Ireland). For some untraced Latin quotations in Irish writings see Meyer, Learning etc. 27 n. 36. A possible allusion to Juvenal xii, 57-9 and xiv, 288-9 in Eriugena's joke to Charles the Bald (when the Emperor asked him across the table Quid distat inter sottum et scottum John replied Tabula) was suggested by the present writer in PMI A 49 (1943-4) Minutes 3-4. The Scholia Bernensia on Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics, attributed to Adamnan, deserve mention as an indication of early Irish study of a classical author. Some examples of references to classical mythology in the early Hiberno-Latin hymns are : Scylla and Charybdis, Acheron (to which a glossator adds Styx and Phlegethon, and rather rashly remarks that Scylla was a daughter of Charybdis who had been trans formed into a monster by the jealous Circe): the Sirens, Tartarus, and 'nine daughters of Orcus' namely 'in the sky Stenna, Euriale, and Medusa; on earth Clothus, Lacessis, and Antropus; in the underworld Electo, Migera and Stifone' (these last weird variations sound like the products of an oral rather than a written tradition): see Bernard and Atkinson Irish Liber etc. i, 75, 139, 164. Atkinson's Passions and homilies from Leabhar PROC. R.I.A., VOL. 70, SECT. C [D2]</page><page sequence="10">22 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Knowledge oe Greek in medieval Ireland25 The evidence for some acquaintance with Greek in early Christian Ireland is clear in the Greek words and letters to be found in the early Hiberno-Latin and vernacular Irish writings. The main problems are its provenance and extent. The first problem is complicated by the fact that the more eminent Irish Hellenists of the ninth century might have acquired some, or indeed all, of their Greek after they had left Ireland. Some of these later scholars, like Eriugena and Martin of Laon, had enough confidence even to compose Greek verses?not very successfully, to be sure, but notable achievements in the western Europe of their time.26 But the golden legend cherished both by writers of literary histories in the nineteenth century and by some medieval commentators on Irish learning has not been sustained by recent critical studies. Douglas Hyde in his influential Literary History of Ireland (1899) had quoted with evident approval Darmesteter's opinion: The classic tradition, to all appearances dead in Europe, burst out in full flower in the Isle of Saints, and the Renaissance began in Ireland 700 years before it was known in Italy. The more cautious view of present-day scholars has been expressed by Bieler : There is no evidence to show that the ancient Irish knew even a single writer or poet of classical Greece in the original . . . some works of the Greek Fathers which were little known, or even unknown, in the West seem to have reached Ireland in translation. It is possible, and certainly Breac (Dublin, 1887) contains some other classical references (see index), including a statement in a version of the story of Saint George, 'There is no god but Apollo, with Hercules and Neptune' (borrowed, no doubt, from the Troy Tale). One may recall here Aldhelm's warnings against the risk that a student in the Irish schools of the seventh or eighth century might be persuaded to pay too much attention to pagan myths, since 'What benefit can orthodox truth derive from the studies of a man who spends his energies in inquiring into the incests of the impure Proserpine, the adventures of the petulant Hermione, the bacchanals of Lupercus, or the parasites of Priapus?' (Opera ed. Giles, p. 332, cf. William of Malmesbury Gest. pont, v ? 214). David Greene, C?ltica ii (1954) 278-96, has published a middle Irish poem on Latin nouns (based on Priscian), which he thinks may be eleventh-century. The poem in sixty-nine Latin hexameters entitled Versus euiusdam Scoti de alphabeto printed in Baehren's Poetae Latini minores v, 375-8 and attributed to the early seventh century deserves further study: see Kenney 275 and 604. J. B. Bury in a letter to Kuno Meyer (published by D. W. Greene in H xcvii, 1963, 94-5) suggested that the word arcMclocos in the Vita tripartita (Stokes 312) might be a corruption of Archillocos, i.e. Archilochuses in the sense of malicious poets (taken perhaps from Horace, Ars po?tica 79). Windisch had taken it as a corruption of a Greek word On the influence of Spanish Latin writers, especially Isidore, in Ireland see Hillgarth, Visigothic etc., and the works cited by him. See also Alf Sommerfelt on Latin influences on the insular Celtic languages in Acta Gongressus Nadvigiani v (Copenhagen, 1957) 157-62. 25 In this section I am particularly indebted to the works by Bieler, Bischoff, Courcelle, Esposito, Gougaud, Laistner, MacNeill, Kuno Meyer, Roger, Stephens and Zimmer listed in my bibliography. 26 The Irish writers of Greek verse certainly made elementary mistakes?as when Eriugena produces as a hexameter ?p^uiv ?pyayy?Xw re ^opwv dyy?\u&gt;i^ re ritXavywi', and Martin ends one of his hexameters Sov Sia/xara ^?Xatv ( = ^e?'A?o-tj&gt;)?but to dismiss Eriugena's Greek verses as 'very poor' (Esposito, Knowledge etc. 680 n. 1) disregards the fact that even faulty efforts of the kind were mirabilia in western Europe at that time. Another noteworthy point : for Eriugena in his prose works the mot juste is often a Greek one, i.e. he thinks in Greek. See n. 42 below.</page><page sequence="11">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 23 arguable, that in some places a scholar could get elementary instruction in Greek grammar. There seem also to have existed in Ireland some Greco-Latin glossaries and conversation books. Many Irish scribes were familiar with the Greek alphabet and used it as a specially solemn script. For instance, the Lord's Prayer in the Book of Armagh (c. 807) is written in Greek letters, although the text is in Latin. They wanted to have some knowledge of Greek, even if they were unable to write it, just as they affected a knowledge of Hebrew. Hebrew, Greek and Latin were the three 'sacred languages', the languages of the title on the Cross of Christ.27 In discussing the ninth-century Irish scholars on the continent Bieler holds that they acquired much of their Greek outside Ireland. But another aspect of the problem has also to be taken into account. As will be noticed later, some elements in the early vernacular Irish tradition?as distinct from the Latin writings to which Bieler was specifically referring?seem to suggest contacts with sources of Greek mythology not attested elsewhere in the western tradition. This was the additional factor that chiefly prompted scholars to suggest direct contacts between early Ireland and genuine Hellenists whether they were missionaries or else rhetoricians driven to Ireland from the continent by barbarian invaders.28 Further, even the elementary amount of Greek which clearly was known in early Ireland could hardly have been learned from books alone especially in view of the evidence that the Irish knew how to pronounce it reasonably well. And it has not been proved that Eriugena, for example, did not learn more than a little Greek before he left Ireland.29 27 Bieler, Ireland etc. 14. 28 For various conflicting theories about the provenance of Greek in Ireland see especially Kuno Meyer's masterly Learning etc. He reviews earlier opinions and accepts the possibility of direct contacts with Greek learning through fugitive scholars. Among subsequent writers Esposito (Knowledge etc. 683), Ryan 382, besides Bieler, believe that insular Irish knowledge of Greek was slight. Band in his Founders of the middle ages (Cambridge, Mass., 1928) supports 'the old-fashioned and roseate view'. Zimmer in his magisterial articles, ?ber direkte etc. argued first for effective influence by the early missionaries, and later for emigrant Gaulish scholars : he believed that Greek was a living language for early Irish scholars, and emphasised the Latin influence on the Gaulish grammarian ' Virgilius Maro'. Edward Gwynn, The metrical Dindsenchas iii, 24^-5, takes the reference in that work to 'the great market of the Greek foreigners' to be a genuine memory of Greek traders from Marseilles. But Eoin Mac White in ZOP'xxv (19?5) 29 rejects that view. Courcelle 389 discounts the likelihood that Greek or Syrian merchants could have had any marked literary influence even in Southern Gaul (but the kind of story-telling material common to the Irish heroic narratives, as discussed below, and Greek epic could have been transmitted through sailors' yarns and travellers' tales, just as Homer himself may have acquired material from that source). For the presence of foreigners from the Eastern Mediterranean, Gaul, and Spain, in early modioval Ireland see Kenney 118 ? and cf. Chadwick Studies chap. viii. 'Dobda the Grook* is probably only a corruption of the Irish Dub-d?-chrich (Kennedy ?23). Bolgor 94 romarks that the early Irish scholars seem to have known Greek 'as an apprentice magician might know a supposed language of sorcery'. 29 Manitius 324 accepts the view that Eriugena had received a good foundation in Greek before he left Ireland. M. R. James (Cambridge medieval history iii, 1922, 498 if) accepts the possibility that some ecclesiastical Greek writers not available in Latin trans lations were used in Ireland. But there is no firm evidence. Adaxnnan refers to libri Graecitatis, apparently available at lona, in De locis sanctis 2, 27, 6: soo Meehan ad loc. For examples of Greek words in early Irish writings in Ireland see Stokes and Strachan Thesaurus, Stokes' edn. of Cormac's Glossary (see n. 41 below), Bernard and Atkinson, Irish etc., Reeve's and Fowler's edns. of Adamnan's life of St. Columba, Meehan's Adamnaris etc. 97 and Warren's edn. of the Bangor Antiphonary ii (index at Greek).

Helhnan, Sedulius</page><page sequence="12">24 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy To assume that this was impossible begs the question. Aldhelm more than a century before Eriugena's time had called Irish teachers didascoli ArqiviPa Perhaps, then, the question is not entirely settled. A complete corpus of all Greek words and notable references to Greek mythology (not to be traced to intermediate Latin sources) in Hiberno-Latin and vernacular Irish sources remains to be collected before an entirely convincing conclusion can be established. Even a cursory glimpse of this material reveals some curiously idiosyncratic touches of perhaps typically Irish audacity. For example the codex Laudunensis 444, which contains work by both Martin of Laon and Eriugena, includes transcriptions from the Greek passages in Priscian. The scribe obviously had great difficulty with the Greek script of the original. But he was undeterred, and where his knowledge failed he used his imagination boldly. So? for example, having wrongly divided the Homeric phrase eK?ocy^ccv ?'?p ??ctto?30 to produce the ghost word ?av6apoi?, he boldly proceeded to explain it as nomen de sono factum, id est de sono bucinae, guessing from a previous Latin quotation about a trumpet-call. Again a reference to the Ajax mastigophoros of Sophocles is misread to give a word cro?ocpopa which is boldly glossed sapientifera.31 When a corpus of Hiberno-Graecisms has been compiled,32 one special question might be profitably considered. Do the transcriptions of Greek words into Irish give any clear indication of how Greek was pronounced by the early Irish scholars ? There is the curious fact, for example, that the Irish trans criptions sometimes preserve the classical pronunciation of zeta as sd, as in sdodiakos for ?cp8iaK?c33 or as st as in Elisiabeih for Elizabeth and Stacharias for Zacharias,34 while zeta is called steta in the Book of Lecan Uraicept? this at a time when the normal pronunciation of zeta in Greek or Latin was like zed. The reason for this remarkable piece of hellenismos in Ireland is probably Scottus (Munich, 1906). Kenney lists the ancient testimonia on knowledge of Greek in early Ireland (including an obscure statement in the perhaps sixth century Eulogy of St. Columba possibly referring to Greek grammar: ? Cu?v Linguistic etc. 158 takes this as 'showing possibly a regard in secular society for grammatical theory and a consciousness of the Greek origins of current grammatical doctrine'): See also Walker, On the use etc., Dottin, La legende etc. 155. Dino Bigongiani notes some linguistic defects in the glosses on Martianus Capella attributed to Eriugena in CP xxxvi (1941) 72-9: see also Esposito in ZCP vii (1910) 499-509.

Laistner also humorously notes from Greek verses preserved in the same ms that the stop-gap S? aud y* (placed out of their legitimate position) was in use by the Irish scholars then (as they continued to be till recently, when Greek verse ceased to be a compulsory subject in the classical examinations at Trinity College, Dublin). The scribe in Laudun. 444, as Laistner notes, faithfully transcribed the digamma (e.g. FeAeiav in Priscian 1, 20). 32 Such a collection was begun by Tomas Ua Nuall?in in The Irish Ecclesiastical Record 4th ser. xxv (1909) 513-23 and xxvi 163-71, but was not continued.

Graves in H ii (1876) 456. Professor Bieler has referred me to another use of z in transliterating Greek words : biozanti for biothanatoi in Vita IV of St. Patrick c. 74 (an omission in Colgan) ; cf. Commodian, Instr. 1, 14, 8.</page><page sequence="13">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 25 to be found in Priscian35 who in his discussion of pronunciation states that the Greeks sounded z as a double letter sd, while the Romans pronounced it as s, ss, or d. The Irish scholars, remote from strong influence by Byzantine Greek, with commendable purism pronounced it?or at least transliterated36 it?in the classical Greek manner. On this question of phonology Vendryes has emphasised an important point. Meyer in his Learning in Ireland in the fifth century had given a tabula tion of Irish transcriptions of Greek words (taken mostly from Cormac and O'Mulconry) showing that: oci was written as either ae or e (e.g. cae ? Kai gennome ? y?vouai, ema = oc?uoc); ei was written as i (cires = Xe?P8S&gt; ditos ? SetAo?); n was written either as e or i {bole ? ?oAf|, egemon = f\y?\xcovt rissis ? pfjcri?, and perhaps cichis = icnK??); ou was written as u (cruma ? Kpotfuot); u either as i (doriforos ? Sopucp?pos, glicin = yAuKvv) or = u (gune = yvvfj, eluo ? eAvco) ; au was written as ao (faolos = ?auAo?), 0 when at the beginning of a syllable as t (trenon = Opfivov, antropos = avOpcoiros) but elsewhere = th or d (cathero = KaOaipco lidos = AiOos); initial x as c (cara = X&amp;p?, cilia ? ye?Xsa : no example cited of medial x) ? 9 as either ph (philo = cpiAco) or / (faolos = cpaOAo?) ; yx as nc (brancos = ?poyxos) ; ? and y? as s (silon ? ??Aov, psaltis ? i/raATty?); and the rough breathing is ignored (etera = eTaipa, eros = f|pcos).37 Vendryes38 accepted this as evidence for two methods of pronouncing Greek in Ireland, one (the older, he thought) as if it were Irish, the other as in contemporary Greek, learned from native Greeks such as the one who taught the Computus to Mosinu Moccu Min. But in view of the sd or st trans cription of zeta already mentioned, it might be that the classical pronunciation survived to some extent in this far western land of would-be Hellenists. If so, one must ask did the Irish learn about it entirely from books like Priscian's InstitutiOy or did they also hear it expounded by some purist grammarian from Gaul or a wanderer from Greek lands like the grammarian Demetrios of Tarsus who, Plutarch says,39 visited Britain in the first century A.D. In considering the competence in Greek of the early Irish scholars some eminent scholars have been unjust to them in one way. They judge Irish 35 Inst. 1, 49. But Professor Quin has suggested to me that the substitution of st for % may have been due to the fact that Irish had no initial z (as in 'zoo') while initial st- was common. Professor Richardson has informed me that in the Ogham alphabet z is transliterated by a symbol which stands for st. 36 Dottin, La legende etc. 171 notes that in Togail Troi 634 'Gruni' for TpvTT % (Herodotus 4, 13) looks like a mistranscription of a Greek text. 37 In connection with this list Professor Carney and Professor Quin have pointed out that initial th is rare in Irish (being found only as a modification of initial ?), which might well explain the t- for th-. Also initial ch- is rare; and h- does not occur in Old Irish in contexts where it represents the sound [?]; and yv is not an Irish consonantal group. 3?

(Alcuin had, for example, derived 'Hypocrite' from 'Hippo, Graece falsum'.) It seems, then, that further consideration might credit the early Irish scholars with more knowledge of the Greek language than is currently admitted. At any rate, whatever the provenance and extent of their Greek was, they were certainly eager to learn and use as much as they could of it. As has been already noticed, they were largely free from the antipathy to the pagan authors which eminent clerics elsewhere felt. And with regard to Greek in particular, it seems that the Irish on the continent were not appreciably affected by ecclesiastical hostility towards the language spoken by the quarrelsome Patriarchs of Constantinople. Up to the eighth century there had been Popes who were Greek by birth. But such oecumenism ceased in the ninth century, as the controversies between Rome and Constantinople became exacerbated. Yet in that same century Eriugena was eagerly exploring the writings of the Orthodox Fathers, and it has even been argued that he saw his spiritual home in Constantinople rather than in Rome,42 though here one must allow for the effect of political rapports between the new western Emperors and their imperial contemporaries in the east. In our next section we shall see some evidence for a similar pro-Greek attitude in one of the Irish versions of a Latin classical author. All in all, despite changes in continental attitudes towards Greece, the Irish do not seem ever to have forgotten or repudiated the eulogy of Greek civilisation at the beginning of their beloved Priscian : Cum omnis eloquentiae doctrinam et omne studiorum genus sapientiae luce praefulgens a Oraecorum fontibus derivatum Latinos proprio sermone invenio c?l?brasse et in omnibus illorum vestigia liberalibus consecutos artibus video .... Finally, it may not be fanciful to see, as many scholars have suggested, a temperamental affinity between the imaginative, free-thinking Irish and the Greeks. One can find evidence for it in Berkeley, Burke and Joyce, as well as in Eriugena. The rigorously matter-of-fact and logical Roman mentality 40 For recent evidence and views on Greek pronunciation see W. S. Allen, Vox Graeca (Cambridge, 1968).

Vendryes in reviewing Esposito's Knowledge etc. (see a. 38) considers his conclusions too negative and remarks about Cormac's knowledge of Greek 's'il ne savait le grec, il est indubitable que Cor mac savait du grec'. 42 Cf. the remark about Eriugena by William of Malmesbury : a Latinorum tramite deviavit dum in Graecos acriter intendit (Migne, Patrolog. Lat. 122, xxii-iii) and Eriugena's praise of Constantinople in his Latin verses (Migne, loc. cit. xxv). Cf. n 26 above.</page><page sequence="15">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 27 seems to have been less congenial to Irish minds. There is a memorable record of this in the traditional accounts of the legendary conversations between Patrick and Oisin, where Patrick with his Roman mind thinks that Oisin with his apparent exaggerations and inventions is a liar; but in the end Oisin by the use of magical powers establishes the independence of the imagination from the everyday facts of life. This temperamental affinity between the Greeks and the Celts is not simply a belief of Irish philhellenes. At least one Greek geographer, known under the pseudonym of Scymnus of Chios, speaking of the Celts in Spain, wrote verses in praise of their Hellenic affinities, about 100 B.C.: XpoovTai ?? KeA*roi to?? I'O&amp;tiv 'EAAnviKot? sXOVTss oiKgi?TaTa Trp?? TTjv cEAA?6a ?i? Tas uiro6ox?S tcov ?iri^vouu?vcov43 'The Celts use customs of a Greek kind and they are on very familiar terms with Greece because of their hospitality towards those who visit them.' In the later medieval period the knowledge of Greek seems to have disappeared among the Irish. The latest documentary evidence in Ireland is to be found in the glossaries of Cormac (about 900) and of O'Mulconry.44 On the continent there is the commentary on Martianus Capella, which uses some Greek, attributed to the Irishman Dunchad. It has been suggested that the writers of the twelfth-century Greek psalter in Cambridge and another twelfth-century manuscript containing explanations of Greek words (in Trinity College, Dublin) were Irish: but this is not certain. Godfroi of Waterford, in the thirteenth century, who will be noticed more fully later, is credited with a knowledge of Greek and Arabic, but the claim does not seem to have been proved from his still unpublished works. In the middle of the fourteenth century Archbishop Fitzralph of Armagh is said to have learned Greek from a Greek at Avignon. At the end of the fifteenth century a Greek called Brana or Braua,45 became bishop of Dromore (1483) and later of Elphin (1499), but nothing is known of his influence in those rather wild dioceses, hardly congenial to a native of Athens, These few contacts were only straws in the storms of war and conquest which prevented any revival of Greek studies in Ireland until the seventeenth century. Latin, of course, firmly established on the rock of the Church continued to be the second language of both clerics and scholars without intermission through the whole medieval period, as will be illustrated later. 43 M?ller, Geographi Graeci minores 1,200-2.

Ware states that he himself saw an episcopal document with the name 'Georgii Branni' on it. If the Irish version of his name was Brann, he may have been a member of the powerful Byzantine family of Branas.</page><page sequence="16">28 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Non-literary Greek and Roman influences in early Ireland Suggestions have been made that early Aegean influence (Minoan or Mycenean) can be detected in the art and architecture of the megalithic tombs in Ireland 46 and in the labyrinth pattern on the stone found near Hollywood, Co. Wicklow.47 But the tombs are now believed to antedate the Mycenean tholoi by several centuries, and the authenticity of the labyrinth stone is questioned. Two Minoan-type double axes have been found in collections made in Co. Kildare and Co. Antrim. It is uncertain whether they were of ancient or modern importation. A recent writer believes that they came to Ireland in Mycenean times.47a. Early Cypriot or Palestinian influence has been suggested on the Irish 'bar-twist' gold ear-rings470. t But the mode of transmission of this influence is uncertain, as also that of faience beads47c. In no case can direct contact with Greek lands be established beyond doubt, as yet. Irish legends about early invasions ascribe a Greek origin to some of the early settlers in Ireland, and references to visits by Greek princes to Ireland and Irish princes to Greece occur in mythical narratives.48 Ireland may possibly have been visited by Phoenician or Greek explorers such as Himilco (about 500 B.C.) or Pytheas (about 325 B.C.). At any rate in the second century A.D. Ptolemy the geographer seems to have got his information from good sources. Tacitus49 states that Irish harbours and approaches were known to the Romans from reports by traders.50 46 For early advocacy of this view (after Evans' discoveries in Crete) see George Coffey, New Grange . . . the influence of Crete and the Aegean on the extreme West of Europe in early times (Dublin, 1912). 47 See L.

A notable hoard discovered at Balline, Co. Limerick, in 1940, contained three good pieces of silver plate, one of them ornamented with a lively hunting scene (perhaps of late first- or early second-century Alexandrian provenance), and two silver ingots.52 On the basis of these finds, combined with the statement in Juvenal arma quidem ultra littora Iuvernae movimus (Satires 2, 159-60) a few scholars have argued for a Roman invasion of Ireland.53 (An Irish legend says that a son of 'the king of the Romans' came to invade Ireland but was drowned by a tidal wave near Drogheda.54) But this remark of Juvenal's may only refer to a naval expedition?in fact an olla of early second-century date has been dredged up one hundred and fifty miles west of the Irish coast55?and, further, if there had been a formal invasion Tacitus could hardly have failed to mention it in his Agricola. Possible Mediterranean influences on early Irish art have received a good deal of attention.56 Roman features have been discerned in the curve-patterns, spiral-patterns and in the enamelling technique of the Irish La T?ne period, and many scholars have found Eastern Mediterranean features in the illumina tions of manuscripts in the early Christian period. On the other hand the anthropomorphic and realistic traditions of Graeco-Roman art (whose influence spread as far as China and India in the East) failed to have any appreciable effect whatever on the Celtic artists. In this one finds a sharp contrast with the Irish literary tradition in which the naturalism of the Graeco-Roman style was readily adopted. 51 The Roman finds (as distinct from classical antiquities in collections, which wil be noticed later in this study) are reviewed by ? R?ord?in, Roman etc., with a bibliography up to 1947. Some later finds are mentioned by M. J. O'Kelly (PRIA 63 C. 2 (1963)), G. D.

C |XU]</page><page sequence="18">30 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Classical references and borrowings in early Irish texts In this area of Irish literature a knowledge of early and middle Irish is obviously essential for any authoritative judgment. The present writer has no qualifications in this respect, so what follows here must be based on translations, commentaries, and help from experts. It is offered primarily to classical scholars who may be unfamiliar with the very remarkable echoes and develop ments of the classical tradition which are to be found in the vernacular Irish writings. Celtic scholars, to whom the material quoted will be generally familiar, will, it is hoped, be indulgent to such a rash intrusion on their terri tories. At least this writer comes offering peace, not war. Besides linguistic difficulties, serious uncertainties of dating arise as might be expected in connexion with a literature that was considerably dependent on an oral tradition. As in the similar conditions of Homeric studies, here even the experts often disagree, and anyone who has to rely on translations can at best only list their various views. The present writer may, he hopes, be excused if he omits such problems here, and confines himself to broad outlines. There are two main genres of medieval vernacular Irish literature in which classical influences have been detected. The first, and much the older, is that of the early heroic legends, the second that of the early translations into Irish of Latin authors. Since the stimulating writings of Jubainville in the latter half of the nineteenth century much has been written about classical material in the heroic narratives. ^ An exhaustive critique of all the suggestions made by him and his successors has yet to be published. Only a brief summary will be attempted here. Jubainville believed that many of the analogies which he found between the Irish sagas and Homer or Hesiod were not literary borrowings but 'from an old foundation of Greco-Celtic legends anterior to the separation of the two races, at that unknown period when the Hellenes or Greeks, abandoning to the Celts the cold valley of the Danube and the mist-laden regions of western Europe, settled down on the warm plains and the splendid coasts of the Peninsula lying to the south of the Balkans'57. He qualified this, however, by adding that many features might belong to universal standards of heroic conduct. Subsequent scholars58 rejected several of his parallels as far-fetched, and explained the residue on different grounds. They believed that influence from Greek epic was more likely. (Anyone who accepted Ridgeway's theory of the Celtic origin of the Achaeans59 could, indeed, reverse the direction of 57 Translated by Best, The Irish etc. 69. 58 E.g. Dillon, Early etc. 11 n 20, Carney, Studies etc. 305-23, and Eleanor Hull, CR ii (1906-7) 62-76 and 138. Other parallels are noticed by Jackson, Oldest etc. 12-14, Cox, Dottin; La legende, Murphy, Saga etc. 26-60, and Cross passim. Many of those suggested by D. Fitzgerald in RC v (1885) 193-259 are far fetched. 59 For Sir William Ridgeway's theory of the Celtic origin of the Achaeans see his Early etc. i, chap. 4. The traditional Irish belief that various early invaders of Ireland originally came to Ireland from or via Greece is frequently stated in the Irish chronicles: see Macalister Lebor etc., and O'Rahilly Early Irish etc. especially 432-4. In Stokes The Rennes etc. 81 (cf. nos 58 and 134), we learn that two Irish princes were descended from 'men of the Greeks, Greeus son of Pont and Danaus son of Pont'. The passage</page><page sequence="19">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 31 the influence.) One eminent scholar60 went so far as to say that a particular motif, was doubtless, borrowed from the Iliad) and he has found support. Before a third possibility is suggested it may be well to look at some of the analogies in question. It has been strongly argued that a frequent device in old Irish literature is a clear case of borrowing from Homer. Its main features have been defined like this: A person, X, is approaching a group of people. Amongst the latter is an individual who might be called the 'knowledgeable watcher' who has known X before. The waiting group also includes an ?ignorant watcher' whose function it is to ask questions as to X, so giving the 'knowledgeable watcher' an opportunity of speaking about X, and thus, in a dramatic manner, conveying to the reader or audience information necessary to the development of the story.61 The theory is then offered that this is derived from the scene in Iliad 3, 161 ff where Helen identifies the leaders of the Greek army to Priam on the walls of Troy. Many other equivalents of classical motifs have also been suggested : for example, the piercing of Etarcomal's heels for the attachment of bonds for him to be dragged behind the chariot of Fergus in The cattle-raid of G?ailnge (cf. the similar treatment of Hector in Iliad xxii, 395 if); the sparing by C? Chulainn of the life of a charioteer cutting wood to replace a broken chariot pole (of. Iliad xxi, 34 ff) ; the vision of redness seen by a female fili when con sulted by Medb on the fate of the Connaught army (cf. the clairvoyance of Theoclymenus in Od. xx, 350 ff) ; the 'hero-light' of Irish champions and the appearance of fire from the heads of Greek heroes (II. v, 4-7, xviii 205-6) ; the blacksmiths who hurl a lump of molten metal at the ship of Mael D?in and the Cyclops' actions in Od. ix, 480-542; the reception of Mael D?in in the course of his voyages by a mysterious queen and her daughters and the subsequent necessity for his companions to rebuke him for staying on too long (cf. the Circe incident in Od. x, 333 ff, especially 469-86; influences from Lucian's Vera historia have also been suggested in the adventures of Mael D?in 62), There is a clear case of borrowing, but probably not direct, in the use of wax ear-plugs and the reference to Ulysses in the Book of invasions.?3 continues : 'The latter is an ancestor of the Fir Bolg. And one of the two families prevailed over the other and deprived them of their sweet-tasted water, for in the lands of the Greeks a power of impounding is given over water; and they were made subject to slavery, namely to drag mould (in leathern bags) on to bare flagstones, so that it might be seven cubits deep on the stones . . . they fled before that tyranny to Ireland'?a garbling of the Danaid legend, apparently. For a bold attempt to prove that the Tuatha D? Danaan were originally Aaraoi (driven out by the Dorian invasion) see D. Daly, The Tuatha I)e Danaan, Homeric and Irish (London, 1909). Cf. n 63. below. 60 Dillon, Early etc. 11. 61 Carney, Studies etc. 307. 62 Stokes, Voyage etc., introduction. For possible classical influences in the Voyage of Bran see Tom?s O Broin, ZGP xxviii (1961) 262-71. 63 See Macalister Lebor etc. ii, 20-21 for a passage describing how when the Gaels were traversing the Caspian Sea and a siren prevented them from sleeping, their Druid 'Caicher' (i.e. Calchas) put wax in their ears. Professor Carney has referred me to a poem in the Book of Leinster (c. 1100 A.D. or earlier, he thinks) which tells how Ulysses 'put wax in his. ears' and describes him as the son of 'Lirta' and Anticla'. The same poem men tions many other classical figures from history and mythology.</page><page sequence="20">32 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy It has been suggested, too, that the incident of the horse presaging St. Columba's death might be derived from the similar prophecy by Achilles' horse in J?. 19, 404-23.64 Similarities have also been noted between the two different kinds of after-world in Irish mythology and the Hades and the Elysium of Homer.65 These have all been related to specific passages in Homer. More general analogies have also been noticed between the stories of Adonis and of Diarmaid, of Oenomaus and Aodh, of Orpheus and Finn, of the donkey-eared Midas and some horse-eared Irish personalities, and of Theseus' black-sailed ship and Finn's. Several Hercules motifs have been paralleled, and attention has been drawn to Irish analogues of the Skylla-Minos and Dionysus-Zagreus legends, and of the 'horn of Amalthea'66. Several suggestions not mentioned here are testimonials more to the classical piety of their authors than to any thing else, as when Whitley Stokes noted that a warrior both in Acallam na Sen?rach and Iliad 22, 294, carries a white shield and that palaces in both the Acallam and the Odyssey had silver lintels to their doors. If the present writer may venture to express an opinion, no clear evidence for direct literary borrowing from Greek epic seems to him to have been presented yet, though a few examples, especially those cited from the story of Mael D?in, certainly suggest a knowledge of Odyssean material (as distinct from the actual text of the Odyssey) unparalleled in western Europe in their time. Much has been made of the similarities between the Irish variants of 'the watchman device' and the teichoskopia of Iliad iii (where in fact many Homerists have considered it inept). The main controversy has arisen between those who consider it to be derived from Homer and those who take it as part of an early common stock of heroic tales.67 But a third possibility might be considered. The incident might have, been taken from life itself and could have been developed independently in each literary tradition.68 After 6* Cox 282 f. 6&amp; O'Rahilly 481-2 argues strongly against this suggestion. 66 For these and other suggested classical parallels from a later date see Murphy, Duanaire etc., index at Folklore: Parallels, Greek-Irish. J, J. Savage in Studies in honor of E.K. Rand (ed. W. Jones, New York, 1938) 263-72, suggests that the story of Liadain and Cuirithir recalls that of Laodamia and Protesilaus (via Ovid's Heroides), on slender evidence. Professor J. J. O'Meara suggests that there are significant parallels between the Euryalus and Nisus incident in Aeneid 9, and the story of Fiechna and Inse in the tale of Bruidhean Ohaorthainn. For analogies between Diarmaid and Adonis see A. H. Krappe, Folklore xlvii (1936) 347-61. Mary E. Byrne might have mentioned the story of Dana? and Perseus as a parallel in her article on the punishment of setting people adrift (?Hu 11, 1932, 97-102). The story of how C? Chulainn was kept from an attack by a parade of naked women is parallelled by the story of Bellerophon and the Lycian women (Plutarch, Mor. 248 B). 67 See, e.g. Murphy ?igse viii (1956-7) 157-8, where he also rejects Thurneysen's suggestion that the Morrigain is to be identified with Allecto in Aeneid vii 323 if (see index to his Die irische etc.). Cf. G. Dottin, L'?pop?e irlandaise (Paris, 1926) 31-2. 68 The several instances of a river's sudden flooding to help or harm people in the Irish heroic narratives which have been compared with the rising of the Scamander against Achilles in II. xxi, 234 ff (see Thurneysen, 96 f), at first sight might be explained away as an independent motif. But an essential feature of it, not previously noticed, it seems, favours a non-Irish origin: Irish rivers are not normally subject to sudden devasting floods ('flash floods'), while Mediterranean rivers are: see the commentators on Virgil, Aen. ii, 305-8?</page><page sequence="21">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 33 all, it is a common occurrence in everyday life that one person asks another person about a number of strangers in the vicinity. The same explanation could obviously account for white shields and suchlike. It would also account for the entertainment of Mael Duin and his companions by hospitable and accommodating women if it were not for the unusual feature of the request by the hero's companions for the hero to take steps to end their long stay. (If the Irish episode included the transformation of men into animals, which it does not, the borrowing might be taken as certain. Similarly, if the incident of the missile hurled at Mael Duin's ship included the extraordinary statement of Od. ix, 483, that it fell in front of the ship and yet nearly hit the steering gear, the borrowing might be taken as proved, too.) In the same way, magical incidents such as talking horses, mermaids and sirens, could have been independently imagined by Greek and Irish authors. In short, such parallels could be the result of any one of four processes : imaginative invention, incorporation of incidents from life, reminiscences from an early common stock of heroic and magical legends, or borrowing from Greek sources. One can rarely, if ever, be quite sure that it must have been the last. Irish free versions of classical themes Direct classical influence is undeniable in the remarkably idiosyncratic Irish re-tellings and free translations of classical stories (mostly heroic to suit the native literary taste). Here again, questions of dating are highly complex, and the present writer must beg leave to sidestep them.69 In general, it seems to be accepted as probable that most of the versions to be mentioned here are at least older than the thirteenth century while some may be much earlier. Anyway, they include some of the earliest vernacular translations of classical literature in existence, as will be noticed later. On the continent of Europe vernacular paraphrase and summaries generally preceded full translations. So it seems probable that this genre came first in Ireland also. The freer Irish versions include the following stories: the adventures of Hercules, Jason and Achilles and the subsequent adventures of Aeneas; Romulus and Remus; Jason and the golden fleece; the 'kin-slayers' of the house of Tantalus ; Cadmus and Harmonia ; Theseus, the Minotaur and Pasipha?, Daedalus and Icarus; stories of Alexander the Great; and the 69 Since this was written Professor Carney has re-examined the problem of dating the classical adaptations in Irish and has kindly allowed me to summarise his views: these adaptations should not be treated as independent phenomena; they are probably all in some way inter-related, as if they were the product of a single school. He notes that G. Mac E?in (see n 78) and E. Peters (see n 70) have suggested tenth-century datings for Togail Troi and the Alexander saga respectively. He suggests that the Boyhood deeds of Achilles (see n 70) goes back to a prose version c. 1050. He suggests that the Flannac?n named as translator of account of the rebuilding of Troy under Astyanax (see end of n 78) could possibly be the king of Bregia, of that name, who died in 896. In general he thinks that the original process of adaptation of the classical stories into Irish is as old as the ninth century, and that in this century the decline of Latin learning began in Ireland, whence the increased use of the vernacular. The period from about 1150 to 1350 was in his opinion the time of lowest creativity in the history of Irish learning (though not of poetry). PROG. R.I.A., VOL. 70, SECT. G [D5]</page><page sequence="22">34 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy wanderings of Ulysses.70 The most arresting of these is the Wandering (lit. 'Going-astray') of Ulysses, son of La?rtes (Merugud Uilix M aie Leirtis) which has been the subject of two critical editions.71 It is an extraordinary amalgam of early Irish and late Latin features (with parallels in the Gesta Romanorum), and it also contains what looks very like echoes of Homer's Odyssey not only in small details but also in characterisation of a kind not to be found elsewhere in early medieval literature. The author is certainly not a slavish copier or paraphraser.72 His Ulysses is a lively recreation of the Homeric hero, excelling in versatility, astuteness, and prudence, and resolutely loyal to his companions, who, as in the Odyssey', are distinguished by their stubbornness and stupidity. This Irish Ulysses has adventures which clearly echo the episodes of the Cyclops, Aeolus, the Oxen of the Sun, and the Lotus-eaters. The incident in Odyssey xix 290-323, when Ulysses' aged dog Argus recognises him, is exalted into the chief proof of identity?the result, presumably, of early Irish regard for hunting hounds. (Is it a mere coincidence that Eriugena73 draws special attention to the same incident from the Odyssey %) Penelope, too, retains some of her Homeric characteristics especially her initial aloofness towards her returned husband (Od. xxiii, 93 if). Also, her fear that the 'Mighty Folk' (the Irish term here for the Olympian gods) may be deceiving her with a false image of her husband is a striking parallel to Od. xxiii, 67-8, A few details might almost be verbal echoes from the Odyssey141. On the other hand, many features are quite foreign to Homer. A Judge of Right is introduced (in place of Aeolus) who gives the wanderers some salutary advice. When Ulysses reaches home and enters his bedroom by a mysterious tunnel he finds a man in bed with his wife. As he is about to kill him, he remembers one of the precepts of the Judge of Right?'Hold your breath and think before acting'?luckily, because the young man turns out to be his son Telemachus. Further, there is a marked emphasis on old age, 70 For these see Best i, 123-5, ii, 90-91, Byrne, Cox, Dottin, Atkinson {Booh of Leinster), and D. Maekinnon, Descriptive catalogue of Gaelic manuscripts in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1912) 194-202. For the Alexander stories see Erik Peters, ZGP xxx (1967) 71-264. On the story of Achilles Professor Carney has kindly given me the following information. It is found in the latest presentation of Togail Troi and also in a poem of 1100 A.D. or earlier, which is based on a text substantially equivalent to Togail Troi (3). The 'Boyhood deeds of Achilles* seems to be mainly based on Statius' Achilleid, hut there are notable additions such as Achilles' contest with 'Aichitolpes\ his slaying of 'water bulls', his rescue of 'Sofractes', son of the king of Corsica from a taloned griffon. The characters occasionally speak in verse, a feature not found in the other Irish classical adaptations. 71 By Kuno Meyer and by R. T. Meyer. See also B. T. Meyer in Modern Philology 1 (1952) 73-8. 72 For a useful analysis of the main types of variation from classical norms in such versions see Williams Cairdius etc. on the Irish version of the Dido legend. 73 De division? 758. 74 Kuno Meyer, Merugud etc. ix, suggests that this curious subterranean passage which Uilix used to get into his bedroom secretly may be a garbling of fxiya ayfia in Od. xxiii, 188, and notes a possible echo of orjfxara from Od. xxiii, 206. Special attention to a brooch in Od. xx, 226 if and the Merugud (Kuno Meyer, 28) is more likely to result from a common interest among Greeks and Irish than from any literary connection. Kuno Meyer (Merugud xi-xii) notes some Odyssean features in The battle of Ventry? sirens, wax ear-plugs, and a reference to Ulixes, son of Laertes and Anticleia, who was killed by 'Lor the haughty son of Telam?n'. Cf. n 63.</page><page sequence="23">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 35 and a typically Irish guest-house is introduced. Touches of realism (exact measurements of distances on the body of the Cyclops, a glimpse of the white frightened faces of Ulysses' companions) alternate with fantastic exaggerations, as when Ulysses has a difficult task to save himself from 'the broad and large loch of water' that burst from the Cyclops* pierced eye (the early Irish writers being virtuosi in describing monstrous giants). Altogether this is a lively and sophisticated fusion of classical and Irish elements. As an Irish version of the Odyssey it anticipates the freedom of treatment that is to be found in James Joyce's Ulysses. It has no close analogues either in the Latin or in the medieval French versions of the Troy Tale, and except perhaps in one detail it ignores Virgil's Aeneid.15 Its general tone, too, has none of the prevailing anti-Greek and anti-Ulysses prejudice of Latin and Romance writings on the Matter of Troy. Yet it has been almost entirely neglected by scholars working in that field. The account of Tantalus and his descendants76 is less effective as a literary work than the Merugud, but it also shows some novel features. Clytaemnestra is like another Medb, and Orestes is told in a vision that if he slays his sister and bathes in her blood and brings an image of Diana to Greece from 'T?urica', he will be cured of his madness. But it has little vividness or style, to judge from a translation. Some of the other versions have still to be edited and translated. Irish translations of Latin classical authors While the sources of these free versions of classical legends are frequently uncertain, there is no doubt about the ostensible origins of the four loose translations?at times they are hardly even paraphrases?into Irish now to be considered. One must say 'ostensible' because, as will soon appear, a great deal of miscellaneous classical information as well as native Irish material is freely interpolated. The extant versions are of Virgil's Aeneid, Lucan's Pharsalia, and Statius' Thebaid, and of Dares Phrygius' Historia de exeidio Troiae.11 (Ovid was rather neglected78, it seems, in pre-Norman Ireland, perhaps because his poetry was not heroic enough.) 75 For the possible echo of Aeneid 3,590 see Kuno Meyor, Merugud xi. 76 See especially Byrne, Parricides etc. 77 See Calder Imtheachta etc., Stokes, In Oath etc. Calder, Togail etc., and Stokes, Togail etc. (the two versions) : also Cox, Mackinnon and Atkinson Book of Leinstar i, 17-18, and R. T. Meyer (on the Lucan and Statius versions) in Papers of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters xliv (1959) 355-63 and xlvii (1962) 687-99. Gwynn notes some further classical allusions not mentioned by Calder in Togail na Tebe. For Irish versions of post-classical stories with vague Greek connections see Best i, 123-5. 78 But Professor Carney has informed me that clearly some of the modioval gloMsa? ors took the obscure phrase Boi obeid m. Amra Coluim Cille as meaning ho was an Ovid (i.e. in his poetical skill) and has referred me to the suggestion of G. Mac Eoin in Studia Hibernica i (1961) 44 nn 28, 29 that the list of the deeds of Hercules in Togail Troi is dorived from Ovid, Heroides ix. Thurneysen in ZCP xviii (1930) 425-6 identified names in an appendix to an Irish version of the Troy tale (Togail Troi) as follows: Beidb porhaps Beda, Ferb = Vergilius, Oras ? Orosius (not Horace), Sugastin ? Justinus, Barr = Varro. Carney rejects the identification of Ferb with Virgil (who is named Uirghil in the text) and prefers to take it as a corruption o?Seirb ? Servius. He notes that Beidb is Beid in the text which, he thinks might be a corruption of Obeid, Ovid. He points out that the passage is affixed to the story of the rebuilding of Troy by Astyanax not to Togail Troi proper. Most recently B. K. Martin, Medium Aevum xxxviii (1969) 245-61 has suggested Ovidian and other classical influences on the Old Irish poem, The Old Woman of Beare (variously dated from the ninth to the eleventh century).</page><page sequence="24">36 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The most striking feature of these Irish versions is the freedom with which the translator adapts or supplements his classical text to suit Irish taste. For example in the Irish Aeneid Virgil's brief description of Pallas (Aeneid viii 587-91) is drastically transformed into the following: 'Comely was the youth that was in their midst. Golden hair upon him slightly curling; a clear, blue eye in his head; like the prime of the wood in May, or like the purple foxglove was each of his two cheeks . . .'. His sword is so sharp that it 'would cut a hair on water ... it would make two halves of a man and he would not perceive it until long afterwards'.79 Of these two descriptions the first passage is typical of early Irish interest in nature, the second, of a strong liking for grimly humorous exaggeration. Whoever wrote this version is also greatly interested in genealogy, descriptions of heroes, fights, storms, monsters, strong emotions, and colours. But he ignores Virgil's touches of pathos and com passion and his subtler poetic effects, expecially his epithets and similes (though Irish-style epithets and alliterative adjectives are also inserted). He is obviously quite uninterested in the Olympian gods and their doings. He fills in gaps in Virgil's narrative and sometimes rearranges it, being apparently confident that he knows better how to tell a good story. His prologue is notably pro-Greek, the pious Aeneas and Antenor being introduced as traitors to their city. Altogether it is a highly independent rendering, to put it mildly. The translation of Lucan's Pharsalia shows similar features. It adds an introduction on the six kingdoms of the world (Assyrian, Median, Persian, Chaldean, Greek, Roman) and on Roman history. It amplifies the battle scenes and the descriptions of heroes and their weapons. Sometimes the added touches of realism are positively grotesque as : Many, too, were men lying on their backs, and faces distorted pale, spectral, and heroes' countenances growing green, and deadened limbs starting, and eyes rolling wildly, and white lips tasting death, and necks of nobles dripping (blood), and cloven lungs oozing out, and gathered heads running together, and red trunks groaning, and pure breasts heaving, and perforated hearts pouring, and mangled hands twitching, and barbaric white soles spurning.80 There are numerous other amplifications, short and long. For example, where Lucan mentions three kinds of augury, the Irishman gives nine. In book seven he inserts a long eulogy of Cicero, not to be found in Lucan (7, 62-3), beginning: . . . the learned sage, and the noble ordained master, and the torch of assembly, and the abyss of knowledge, and the knower of scholarship, and the anvil of history, and the foundation of judgments, and the ceiling of every art, and the key for opening every science, the chief rhetorician (and much more).81 Caesar, the supreme hero, is endowed with Irish hero-feats (at 7,331 if): 'In time of pleasure Caesar used to bow-bend that sword so that its point 79 Calder, Imtheachta etc. 121. 80 Stokes, In Cath etc. 443 81 Stokes, ibid. 335.</page><page sequence="25">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 37 touched the hilt. In the twinkling of an eye, or with the swiftness of a man's thought, the sword would spring and leap again into its blade-straightness'.82 The Irish love of colour comes out in many interpolated adjectives. The style becomes highly rhapsodic towards the end of the work. Then it breaks off abruptly, omitting books eight to ten presumably because they are an anti climax. (One may note in passing a later echo in Patrick O'Kelly's eighteenth century poem Blessings on Doneraile, May Pompey's fate and old Pharsale Be still revered at Doneraile.) The destruction of Th?bes {Togail na T?be?'destructions' were one of the favourite genres of early Irish story-telling) is a version of Statius' Thebaid.83 It also begins with an interpolated introduction on the earlier legends of Thebes, in which Oedipus son of 'the witch Jocasta' is mysteriously lifted up into a very high and smooth tree with a nail through each of his feet. Many explanatory references to Greek myths, sometimes curiously altered, are inserted later. Colours are emphasised?eyes are 'grey' and eliquid-oooP, hills are 'green-surfaced', oars are red, arrows blue, death black, a shield 4lime-white'. (Some of the more striking uses may have been prompted more by alliteration than imagination, experts say.) There are references to Irish wild flowers?eyebright, clover, whitethorn, honeysuckle?, and to salmon and cats. Descriptions are ? l'Irlandaise: Hercules is 'the slaughter-hound of the world's prowess'; Cerberus is 'fierce, horrible, open-jawed, furious, bravely fighting, strong-headed'. This version is far less imaginative than the Irish Aeneid, but at times it seems to catch the pathos of the original rather better, and it has some fine lyrical touches. All in all these translations (in so far as one can judge from English versions) give the impression of having been made not by carefully and methodically instructed scholars but by fluent writers with a wide but at times inaccurate knowledge of classical history and mythology, combined with a lively imagination of their own and a proud confidence in the Irish techniques of story-telling. At times the possibility of more than one trans lator at work suggests itself. The two versions of Dares Phrygius5 Destruction of Troy which are available in translations show similar variations.84 From the point of view of classical scholarship, these Irish works have the merit of being the earliest vernacular translations in existence. Elsewhere the earliest version of the Aeneid was in 1428 (Spanish), of the Plmrsalia in 1380 (French;, of the Thebaid (Italian) in 1570, of the Destruction of Troy (French) c. 1160.85 The main causes of the Irish priority were probably the vitality of Irish literature in the early middle ages, and a greater difficulty 82 Stokes, ibid. 387. 83 See Calder, Togail, etc. 84 See Stokes, Togail Troi (2 versions). The earliest continental version of the Troy tale was Benoit de Sainte Maure's Roman de Troie c. 1160 A.D., which is also a little later than the Irish version in the Book of Leinster (c. 1150 A.D.) and perhaps much later than the original Irish version (see n 69).

G [D6]</page><page sequence="26">38 Proceedings ?f the Royal Irish Academy in understanding Latin in Ireland than in Italy or France or Spain, which is perhaps also one of the reasons why the Irish versions are so strongly impregnated with local colour : imagination can fill in deficiencies of knowledge as well as extending it. A question that deserves further consideration from classical scholars is that of the texts used by these Irish translators. One recent editor of Lucan's Civil war85*1 has touched on it briefly, and cites a few notable variant readings implied in the Irish version. But when he commented that some of these were worthy of 'a more sophisticated age', he had perhaps not paused to enquire just how sophisticated or unsophisticated Ireland was in comparison with Britain in the twelfth century and before it. To conclude this section on early Irish medieval rapports with classical literature, some colophons and marginal notes from Irish manuscripts86 may serve to convey something of the Irish bookmen's lively reactions to their classical sources. After an account of the death of Hector in the Troy Tale a scribe has written: 'I am greatly grieved at the above-mentioned death'. A marginal note to a passage in the Irish Thebaid reads: c0 God and 0 Mary! great is that spiteful madness that was upon Lycurgus as he mourned his hapless infant, compelling the Greeks to destroy their gold and their treasure!' Another commentator has added, after Priscian's statement * Virgil was a great poet', the justifiable codicil, 'he isn't easy either5. After a copy of the Greek alphabet, a scribe adds 'there's an end to that ... and my seven curses go with it!' And a gloss on Pomponious Mela's disparaging description of the Irish as omnium virtutum ignari mdgis quam aliae gentes (3, 6, 53) adds aliquatenus tarnen gnari. Those are the main feelings?a deep and strong emotional involvement in the human situations presented in the classical texts, a readiness to express opinions of one's own, a certain impatience with the difficulty and the laboriousness of the foreign medium, and a touch of patriotism at times. These when combined with a vivid imagination and a vigorous native tradition gave the early Irish versions of the classics their remarkable liveliness and originality so that they have more the quality of renaissance classical painting than of bookish scholarship. It is to be hoped that a full comparative study of these remarkable vernacular versions and translations will be undertaken soon, and also that research in the long neglected analogies between formulaic composition in Homer and in the Irish heroic narratives (on which the first notable study appeared in 196987) may be more fully explored. 85?R.

The last of the notable medieval Irish, versions of a Greek myth appeared in the second half of the fifteenth century. This is the Stair Ercuil ocus a b?s, The story of Hercules and his death.88 It is a highly derivative work, based almost entirely on Caxton's Eecuyell of the history es of Troye, which in turn relied largely on a late French compilation.89 The Gaelic translator handles Caxton's narrative with traditional medieval and Irish freedom. He omits, abridges, paraphrases, augments and re-arranges as he thinks fit?for, after all, had he not seven centuries at least of traditional skill in story-telling behind him ? He likes to amplify descriptions of persons and incidents, in the traditional style of the Irish heroic literature, as when he presents Megara like this : Slender, graceful, affable and lovable; gentle, dark-browed, and with radiant fair hair; stately soft and pleasing; round-heeled, peaceful and shapely; blue-eyed, queenly and very beautiful; gifted, red-lipped and womanly; fair, resplendent and pink-nailed. As in the earlier Irish versions of Greek myths, a giant is always given a horrendous description. So Cerberus becomes : a very great giant, dark and gloomy in colour, with long, very broad ears like the ears of a dog, and a long nose with twisted nostrils. And a warrior's fist would go into each of his nostrils. And (he had) broad, huge eyes like the eyes of an ox in his head, and a long, far-protruding, long-whiskered jaw, and a rough, ugly beard down to his navel, and warrior-like, valorous arms, and rough, thick-palmed hands, and twisted, hairy(?), very long claws on them; and a valiant, broad-chested, firm, warrior-like waist, and brave, thick-boned, hard, strong legs^ and broad, dragging ( ?), very crooked feet under him. One can hardly say that this kind of thing is very imaginative. In fact much of it seems to be the fag-end of the livelier early tradition. But at least it exemplifies the same attitude towards a textus receptus as may be found as early as the Merugud and as late as the writings of James Joyce in his Ulysses. Whether brilliantly or feebly exploited, this freedom is, after all, the essence of genuine mythopoeia, as distinct from mythology. In the following centuries the intensification of the English efforts to complete the conquest and pacification of Ireland left writers in the proscribed 88 Edited by E. Gr. Quin (Dublin, 1939), to whom I am especially indobted for guidance in Irish linguistic matters. The quotations that follow are from his version. Professor Carney has pointed out to me that Hercules figured in Irish story-tolling since at least as early as the ninth century. He appears in Togail Troi (1) 29 and Togail Troi (2) 2038, and also in a poem from the Book of Leinster, published by M. E. Dobbs ZCP xxiv (1954) 139-53, and in a poem by Flannac?n son of Cellach of Brega (who died 896), published by K. Mulchrone in Journal of Celtic Studies i (1949) 80-92, as well as in the Feast of Bricriu (Lebor na hUidre 8863 and 8928 f). 89 For the origins of Caxton's Becuyell see H. O. Sommer's edn.

But references to classical mythology remain frequent in the vernacular tradition, both in literary compositions and in folk tales,90 and Greece continued to be remembered as a remote attractive conntry in habited by kinsmen of the Irish, where wine, conversation, and honey were excellent of their kind. In fact to call someone a 'Grecian' remained a com pliment in Ireland during times when elsewhere the reputation of the Greeks had sunk low in Western Europe?when Shakespeare in his Troilus and Cressida was gibing at the 'cogging Greeks' and when the prevailing definition of a Greek was (to quote the Oxford English Dictionary) ?a cunning or a wily person; a cheat, sharper, especially one who cheats at cards'?nor was it intended as a compliment when Irishmen in the nineteenth century were given the slang name 'Greeks'.91 But the Irish did not forget that according to the legends of their origin they were 'the Grecian Gaels',92 and the imaginary bonds of kinship that had been forged in early times between the greatest heroes of the eastern world and of the west remained unbroken when their neighbours in Britain, France and Spain were looking chiefly to Rome for their exemplars. Further, as will be noticed again later, the leaders of the modern struggle for Irish independence drew their inspiration more from Hellas than from Italy. Examples of interest in classical, and especially Greek, mythology in Gaelic Ireland could be quoted in some quantity. Only a few can be mentioned here. A poem on the Christian kings of Ulster93 (written between 1158 and 1166) begins with a sustained comparison between the princes of Emain and those of Troy: Conchobar is the Priam of this 'northern Troy'; Cu Chulainn is the Troilus; Fergus, the Aeneas (with implications of treachery): Naise, the Alexander; Conall Cernach, the Hector. The poet adds 'Each single man of Emain's territory has a counterpart in tumultuous, lordly Troy: it would be pleasant to enumerate them all, every hero of the fair company'. (One may wonder just how many other names of Trojans he really knew.) Perhaps a hundred years or so later a poem entitled The sword of Oscar in the collection known as Duanaire FinnM traces the genealogy of the sword from Saturn through Jupiter, Dardanus, Tros, Laomedon, Hercules, Jason, Priam, Hector, Aeneas, and so to Julius Caesar, with much circumstantial detail. Another poem (composed not much later than 1300) in the same collection describes how Oscar's army defeated 'the high king of the Greeks' 90 See S. ?

Classical references are frequent elsewhere in this collection, and there are close parallels between the story of Aodh, Eargna, and Con?n, and Oenomaus, Hippodameia, and Pelops, and between Irish and Greek folktale motifs.95 Again, a work on 'The triumphs of Turlough',96 describing wars in Co. Clare in the fourteenth century is closely modelled on the Irish version of Lucan's Pharsalia. And, as one more example, a poem in a fifteenth century manuscript97 eulogises a king in these terms : Lugh's great bow, Finn's noble heart, Alexander's royal part, Trojan Hector's weapons bright, Achilles' prowess in stern fight ; . . . Strength of Manoa's long-haired son, The wise heart of Solomon, Octavian's sway o'er land and seas, And the might of Hercules. In the latter part of the sixteenth century the poet Tadhg Dal? ? Huiginn98 used classical references frequently, showing special interest in the stories of Dedalus (with some variations from the traditional account) and of Hercules. Two hundred years later Eoghan Ruadh ? S?illeabh?in was continuing the tradition with imagination and affection. To quote a scholar99 from this poet's native Munster : The old names in those Greek stories he loved, it is seldom that he invokes them without some fife-giving word in his mouth. Hebe is 'an r?ilteann ?g' ('the young star'). Helen is 'riobh chailce an choimheascair thug ?r na Trae' ('the lime-white lady of the conflict who brought destruc tion to Troy'). Elsewhere she is 'an bhrighdeach Helen' ('the bride Helen'). Not since the days of the Pl?iade, if even then, did the bright-robed Grecians play their parts so entirely unburdened of text-book scholarship. The Irish poets of that time read those classic tales as good, bright stories: they seem, happy folk, to have had the blessed privilege of reading them as the far-off creators of them intended?greedily rather than critically; with the glory that was Greece they made free, finding entrance to it through their own sagas . . . Early in the eighteenth century another poet of Munster?a province celebrated for its classical learning in the eighteenth century, Egan O'Rahilly, pours out sackfuls of classical names in some of his poems. This has boon regarded as his 'greatest blemish' by some of his critics,100 and it certainly sounds like pedantry at times. But like his predecessors in the earlier classical tradition in Ireland, O'Rahilly could treat his sources with ironical humour 95 See Murphy, Duanaire Finn iii, Index at *Folklore: Greek-Irish parallels'. 96 Edited by Standish Hayes O'Grady with an introduction by Kobin Flower ITS xxvi-vii (1924-29).

In general the world of Greek mythology seems to have remained a living thing in the minds of the Munster poets until the end of the creative period of Irish poetry.101 As will be illustrated later, the local schools continued to provide a good grounding in Latin and perhaps more than a smattering of Greek. Latin scholarship from the eleventh to the sixteenth century Invasions and destructions by the Norsemen in the ninth and tenth centuries made conditions difficult for scholars in Ireland.102 The traditional teaching of the liberal arts seems, however, to have survived in some of the monastic schools in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Only two classical textbooks in use during this period have been identified. The first is an Irish manuscript in the British Museum, probably dating from about 1106 (Egerton 3323), which contains fragments of the grammar of Clemens Scottus and of a treatise on the abacus.103 Secondly a copy of Chalcidius' commentary on the Timaeus now in the Bodleian (Auct. F 315), dating from the early twelfth century, is in an Irish hand.104 But there is no evidence that any general interest in classical literature existed in scholastic circles in Ireland in the later medieval period, even among the monasteries founded by the continental orders in the twelfth century and later. However, there was at least one Irishman in Dublin under the Norsemen in the eleventh century who could write competent Latin verse, Patrick, second Bishop of Dublin (1074-84) ,105 He wrote highly rhetorical verses in Latin hexameters, alcaics and adonics, using a fair sprinkling of Greek words (from Latin sources apparently) and some distinctly 'hisperic' phrases. An allegorical piece includes borrowings from Servius' commentary on the Aeneid. 101 For some other classical references in Gaelic poetry see Carney 264, 274-5, and Corkery 75, 105, 149, 173, 195, 197, 204, 206, 226, 261, 265, 270. 102 See L.

A well educated Hiberno-Norman would now have practical use for four languages; and in fact the great Anglo-Irish family of the Fitzgeralds conducted their correspondence for several generations in French, Irish, English and Latin.106 In the early sixteenth century the library in their castle at Maynooth contained books in these four languages, with thirty-four books in Latin including the works of Terence, Virgil and Juvenal, besides French chronicles, medieval romances, an English translation of Cicero's De senectute and De amicitia and a volume by that bright star of the classical renaissance Lorenzo Valla.107 It seems that the Great Earl of Kildare in the late fifteenth century was at least marginally interested in the classics. (The same noble family enjoyed the standing epithet 'Grecian' in poems by Irish writers108?a flattering allusion to their legendary descent from the royal house of Troy.) Nothing of classical interest survives in Hiberno-French. (The poem entitled Proverbs of the Sibyl,109 preserved in the Red Book of Ossory, seems to have been translated from the Latin in France.) But some of the new Irishmen of the Pale showed themselves to be capable of writing lively Latin verses. Notable among these are the cantilenae attributed to Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory from 1317 to 1360.110 There are sixty of these, composed to provide the faithful with songs for festivals which would be more fitting than the current secular songs of the time. Here is an example : Da, da nobis nunc Da nunc corrigere mores, Virtutum carpere flores ; Da, da nobis nunc. Da, da nobis nunc, Da clero volvere libros, Da populo tangere scyphos, Da, da nobis nunc.

In fact the earliest known plays of Irish origin are the religious plays preserved in fifteenth-century manu scripts. But in dramatic style and content they were entirely unclassical apart from the appearance of Hector, Alexander and Julius Caesar among the Nine Worthies. Irish interest in classical drama, whether as a subject for study or as a model for imitation, does not begin until the eighteenth century. Only a few names of notable classical scholars have been preserved from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century.113 A certain Petrus de Ybernia, a contemporary of Michael Scottus (now generally believed to be Scottish) at the Court of Frederick II in Naples, is-said to have taught Aristotelian philosophy to St. Thomas Aquinas.114 The Irish Dominican priest, Godfroi or Jofroi of Waterford,115 who died in France about 1300, made a translation into French of the pseudo-Aristotelian Secreta secretorum, as well as of Dares Phrygius, and Eutropius. He was critical enough to suspect the alleged author ship of the Secreta, and his translation was influential in France. Thomas Hibernicus,116 who was a student at the Sorbonne in 1306, included some passages from pagan Latin authors in his popular anthology Manipulus florum. This work was first printed at Piacenza in 1483, which made it apparently the earliest printed publication by an Irishman.

Latin as a spoken language in Ireland Coming to Ireland first as the liturgical and theological language of the western church, and soon afterwards gaining strength as the medium of Graeco Roman scholarship, Latin eventually became the lingua franca between the native Irish and foreigners.118 There is evidence that its use as such was not confined to clerics and scholars, at least from the sixteenth century onwards. Members of both the Gaelic and the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, like the MacDermots, the O'Neills and the Fitzgeralds, used it in correspondence and in conversing with strangers.119 Some of the Gaelic countryfolk also spoke it. An officer of the Spanish Armada when shipwrecked on the north-west coast of Ireland in 1588 found that the local inhabitants and their chieftain, the O'Cahan, could converse with him in Latin.120 Edmund Campion in his Historie of Ireland (1571) testified of the 'meer Irish' that iwithout either precepts or observation of congruity they speake Latine like a vulgar language, learned in their common Schools of Leach-craft and Law, whereat they begin children, and hold on sixteene or twentie years, conning by rote the Aphorismes of Hypocrates and the Civil Institution, and a few other parings of those two faculties'. In recognition of this widespread use of Latin in Ireland the Irish Act of Uniformity (2 Elizabeth c.2) allowed the use ofthat language in parishes where the minister and congregation did not speak English, Latin being con sidered less dangerous than Irish. One must not, of course, suppose that the colloquial Latin of Ireland was strictly classical in style or vocabulary. Campion as quoted records that it was not, and his friend Richard Stanihurst in fact confirms this in his De rebus in Hibemia gestis (1577) : They do not draw their knowledge of Latin from sources belonging to the grammarians. They despise all that, regarding it as a sordid business and childish trifling. Whatever 'comes uppermost', as is said, they blab out. They do not regulate their words by the grammatical art, nor do they consider the quantities of syllables. They determine the length of every period by the capacity of their breath not by any artistic standard.121 A similar view is expressed a century later in an unpublished record from about 1683: . . . The inhabitants of the county of Kerry, those of them that are down right Irish, are remarkable beyond the inhabitants of the other parts of Ireland for their gaming, speaking of Latin, and inclination to philosophy and disputes therein . . . When they can get no one to game with them, 118 Madden 29-34, Curtis 239 (cf. 241, 250), and A. S.

Meanwhile Latin remained during much of the seventeenth century the main language of the university and grammar schools, as well as of the Catholic clerical schools and seminaries. In Dublin University it was used in examina tions, even in mathematics and science, until well into the nineteenth century. The present writer has been told by a senior colleague that one of the reasons why it was disused for that purpose was that a classical don overheard, to his distress, the following dialogue between a mathematician and a candidate for fellowship : Examiner: Foc squarum (Draw a square). Candidate: Non sum bonus ad Latinum (I am not good at Latin). Examiner: Numquam animus: ignis capul (Never mind: fire ahead). But Latin continues to be used in that College as the language for conferring degrees, for taking the statutory oaths, and for the saying of grace before and after dinner. Vestiges of the common use of Latin in Irish schools survived until this century in some slang terms like pax, adsum, cave, and the question and answer quis ? ego. Also, phrases of highly anglicised or hibernicised Latin? sometimes pejoratively called 'bog Latin'?were still to be heard among university students earlier in the present century, as exemplified in such remarks in James Joyce's Portrait of the artist as a young{ man as123 Credo ut vos sanguinurius mendax estis quia fades vostra monstrat ut vos in damn? malo humore estis, and Til kill you super spottum\ Similar examples of pseudo Latin are to be found in traditional ballads, as in the following hexameters describing how a landlady tried to stuff a broken window : Est domum windosa, est et landladia longa Soppibus et cloutis cupiens stoppare fenestras.123^ Translations into English in the sixteenth century and later The earliest example of classical scholarship on.the part of an English speaking Irishman is generally believed to be Richard Stanihurst's bizarre, 122 Molyneux papers (TCD., Ms. 1,4, 19, f, 92v) I am indebted to Dr. Gerald Simrhs for this quotation and for the reference in n. 147. 123 gee the Jonathan Cape edn.

But, if the opinion of one writer124 on early translations of the classics is correct, another Irishman preceded him. The Register of the London Company of Stationers records the granting in 1565/6 of a licence to print 'The story of Jason how he gotte the golden flece and how he did begyle Media, out of laten into englesshe (i.e. the Argonautica of Valerius Flaccus) by Nycholas Whyte.'125 If this was the Nicholas White who was prominent in Irish politics as a supporter of the Butler faction, he must be granted the title of the first Anglo-Irish translator. But no copy of his work has been traced,126 and it may never have been pub lished. Richard Stanihurst's translation of the first four books of the Aeneid into English hexameters was first published in Leyden in 1582 (and in a revised form in London in 1636) .127 Even for an epoch of bizarre language, his style is often outlandish. For example, Neptune addresses the winds (Aeneid 1, 132) in these terms: What syrs ? your boldnesse dooth your gentilitie warrant ? Dare ye loa, curst baretours, in this my Scgnorie regal, To raise such raks iaks on seas, and danger unordered? . . . Packe hence doggye rakhels, tel your king from me, this errand. And when Laocoon strikes the Wooden Horse in Aeneid, 2, 52: Then the iade; hit, shivered, thee vaults haulf shrillye rebounded With clush clash, buzing with drooming clattered humming. Absurd and grotesque as much of his language is?Tom Nash called it 'clownerie5?, yet the scholarship behind it is serious and sophisticated. Further, Stanihurst's analyses of metre, stress, and diction, in the prefaces to his translation are in many cases sensible and acute. They have been reprinted in modern times for their critical value.128 All in all, apart from obvious blemishes in diction the work is a notable achievement. In the absence of any detailed information about White's rendering of Valerius Flaccus, it stands as a creditable first production of Anglo-Irish scholarship, while in its obscurity and in its fondness for strong alliteration and assonance the translation is kith and kin with earlier Irish versions of the classics. 124 C.

For the historical background see DNB, Seymour chap, x and Madden 17 ff. Stanihurst added miscellaneous translations and Latin verses to his Four books. It is a curious fact that the versions of Virgil published by James Henry, the notable Latinist to be mentioned later, in The Eneis, books I and II (London, 1845), Unripe windfalls in prose and verse (Dublin, 1851), and My book (Dresden, 1853), are almost as grotesque at times as Stani hurst's. 128 See G-.

Smith, Elizabethan critical essays vol. 1 (Oxford, 1904).</page><page sequence="36">48 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Sir John Denham,129 the dramatist, who was born in Ireland in 1615 of Irish parentage but spent almost all his life in England, wrote his much smoother version of Aeneid 2 in 1636. He also translated some parts of the Iliad and of Martial, and adapted Cicero's De amicita and De senectute to English verse. Denham's heroic couplets were admired, copied and even plagiarised by Dryden and Pope, and he is credited with having introduced a new freedom into English classical translations. It was not until the Restoration that the first translation of a classical work was printed in Dublin. It was The wish: being the tenth satyr of Juvenal in Pindaric verse by a person sometime Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin (1675) which was published by E. Wetenhall, an Englishman who had come over to Ireland in 1672 to be a master in the Dublin 'Blue-coat School' (now the King's Hospital). He afterwards became in succession Bishop of Cork and Kilmore and remained in Ireland for about thirty years. (His Greek and Latin grammars continued to be a favourite among Irish schoolmasters for almost two centuries.) Next among Irish translators is Wentworth Dillon, fourth Earl of Roscommon, who published a translation of Horace's Ars po?tica and followed it with his celebrated Essay on translated verse in 1684.130 Johnson's verdict on his literary achievement was that 'he improved taste if he did not enlarge knowledge'.131 Dillon was also a numismatist of some note. Six years after the publication of Dillon's Essay, Ellis Walker headmaster of Foyle College, Derry, published a translation of the Encheiridion of Epictetus which was reprinted several times. Next of note are the short but influential versions composed by the drama tist William Congre ve, who was educated at Kilkenny College and Trinity College, Dublin. (Macaulay in his essay on the Restoration dramatists remarked : 'His learning does great honour to his instructors. From his writings it appears not only that he was well acquainted with Latin literature, but that his knowledge of the Greek poets was such as was not, in his time, common even in a College'.) Congreve produced versions of parts of the twenty-fourth book of the Iliad in 1693. These influenced and impressed Alexander Pope, showing him how to give a heightened dramatic effect to the speeches and action such as no previous translation in English had achieved.132 Pope thanked Congreve in his preface to the Iliad as one who had led the way for him in some parts of his work. He also cited Congreve eulogistically in a note on 129 On Denham in general see the introduction to T. H. Banks' edition of his poetical works (New Haven, 1928). For his influence on Dryden and Pope see op. cit. in n. 132 (index s.v. 'Denham'). 130 There are autograph corrections by the author in the T.C.D. copy. 131 Dillon also produced versions of other parts of Horace and Virgil. 132 See especially The Poems of Alexander Pope (general edition, John Butt) vols, vii, viii (ed.

Congreve's translations from Iliad 24 are reprinted in vol. x, 542-49. Pope also used John Ogilby's complete translations of the Iliad (1660, 1669) and Odyssey (dedicated to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James, Duke of Ormond. 1665, 1669): see p. 48 below.</page><page sequence="37">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 49 Iliad 24, 934, and finally dedicated the whole work to him. Congreve also translated the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, and parts of Juvenal and Ovid, and published a short but not negligible Discourse on the Pindarique Ode in 1706. Pope in the concluding note to his Iliad paid an affectionate and admiring tribute to an Irishman Thomas Parnell,133 whose friendship, he says, 'prevail'd over his Genius in detaining a Writer of his Spirit in the Drudgery of removing the Rubbish of past Pedants' for him. A man of encyclopaedic learning, Parnell had written the Essay on the Life, Writings and Learning of Homer which accompanied Pope's Iliad, and had helped extensively with the notes and translation. The Essay was a sensible discourse for its time, rejecting several of the traditional stories about Homer's life. Parnell also produced a translation of the Battle of the frogs and mice to complete the corpus of poems attributed to Homer. His collected poems contain a rendering of part of Pope's Rape of the Lock into Latin leonine verses. Another notable writer in his day, Nicholas Brady published Proposals for publishing a translation of VirgiVs Aeneids in blank verse in 1713 and followed it up a year later with an undistinguished translation of the Aeneid. It was a fertile age for proposals of that kind. Not all of them bore fruit.134 George Kelly, the well known Jacobite who in 1725 had translated Morabius' history of Cicero's banishment, announced his proposals for a translation of Cicero's letters to Atticus in 1729, but nothing seems to have come of them. Among less eminent translators of the early eighteenth century, a certain 'J. H.,A. M.' (John Hodge) had published in Dublin in 1705 a banal version of the second satire of Persius, and A. S. Catcott and James Sterling offered translations of Musaeus in 1715 and 1718 respectively.13^ A more celebrated figure in his day, Thomas Sheridan, grandfather of the dramatist, produced his rendering of Sophocles' Electra in 1715 and of Philoctetes in 1725. Later he published a translation of Persius. (His grandson was to try his hand with parts of Theocritus, Propertius, Petronius and Aristaenetus.) Charles Carthy in 1731 combined his versions from Horace's Satires with a passage from Theocritus and an adulatory ode in sapphics to George I. In the next year Thomas Dawson's contribution to polite letters and obsequious prefaces appeared with his renderings of Demosthenes' On the Grown and Aeschines' Against Gtesiphon. Ten years later Philip Francis, who was born and educated in Dublin but afterwards worked in England as a schoolmaster, won a good reputation with his Horace. But his versions of Demosthenes and Aeschines (1757-8) were less successful than those of Thomas Lcland, a Fellow of Trinity 133 For Parnell and Pope see index s.v. 'Parnell' in op. cit. in previous note. See also Clarke, Greek studies 128 and Hans-Joachim Zimmermann, Alexander Popes Noten zu Homer (Heidelberg, 1966) index at 'Parnell'. For a classical translation by Goldsmith see A. Friedman's edition of his poetical works (Oxford, 1966) 363. 134 The present writer has in his possession a complete unpublished prose translation in ms. of the Odyssey, the Batrachomyomachia, and the Homeric Hymns and Epigrams (with indexes) dated 1733 by James Hingston then an undergraduate at T.C.D., aged twenty. In the T.C.D.library there are six mss volumes containing a blank-verse translation of the Iliad and Odyssey (dated 1744) by Edward Maurice, Bishop of Ossory. 134a Toland (see n. 147) translated some parts of Diodorus Siculus in 1726.

They were esteemed highly enough to be reprinted ten times over a period of ninety-five years. On the Latin side, John Boyle, fifth Earl of Orrery, published a two volume version of the letters of Pliny in 1751. His version of a Horatian ode has been recently reprinted.135 It would be unprofitable to list the many run-of-the-mill versions of classical authors136?many of them little more than 'cribs'?, which appeared after the middle of the eighteenth century in Ireland. But some deserve mention. The works of Tacitus (1793) by Arthur Murphy, the dramatist, was praised for its dignity and strength but considered 'too periphrastic'. Undismayed, he published a version of Sallust in 1807. Early in the nineteenth century two scholars grappled commendably with rarely translated works. William Preston published a verse translation of Apollonius Rhodius, with notes, in three volumes in 1803 (reprints following in 1811, 1813, 1822), and in 1809 Edward Berwick produced the only complete version of Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana before Conybeare's in 1912. In contrast, Thomas Moore's translation of Anacreon (1800) was the thirteenth since 1700. But it was a creditable piece of scholarship for an amateur, with its introduction, short bibliography, and wide-ranging notes. Its six reprints attested greater popu larity than any of its twenty rivals between 1700 and 1831, and it won the soubriquet of 'Anacreon Moore' for its author. Another celebrated translation by an Irish author was William Maginn's137 Homeric ballads (1839), a vigorous and ingenious attempt to embody the view that Homer's poems had been put together from separate lays. Though described by a later critic as 'dismal perversions of the Homeric spirit', they show marked talent as ballad verse? Matthew Arnold rated them higher than Macaulay's Lays of ancient Borne? and the notes are erudite and acute. (They were abridged in the collected edition.) Maginn's reproduction of Lucian's Dialogues of the dead as blank verse comedies are more faithful to the spirit of the classical author. He also published fluent and witty Latin verses. Another talented and versatile Corkman from Maginn's period was 'Father Prout' (the Rev. Francis Mahony).138 With comparable linguistic gifts and equal liveliness and wit he produced many agile translations of classical poetry. He also excelled in composing sprightly renderings of modern poetry into Greek, Latin, Irish, French and Italian, as, for example, his quadrilingual version of 135 By Ronald Storrs in his monograph on translations of Odes 1, 5 {Ad Pyrrham, London, 1939). He prints four other Irish versions, but states that he was unable to find a version in the Irish language. 136 Among the more celebrated authors of these were Isaac Butt (Ovid's Fasti, 1833 and Virgil's Georgics, 1834) and Archbishop Alexander (part of Aeneid vi 1868). Alexander makes some sharp criticisms of the octosyllabic metre of Conington's translation. For other minor translators from the Greek see Foster as cited in n. 124. 137 For Maginn see DNB, The Dublin University Magazine xxiii (1844) 72-101, and Malcolm Elwin, Victorian wallflowers (London, 1932). 138 See The works of Father Prout by Charles Kent (London, 1881).</page><page sequence="39">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 51 The groves of Blarney. One of his most successful jeux d'esprit was his demon stration that several of Tom Moore's poems were directly derived from ancient lyrics. Mahony described his own work modestly as 'a new combination of the Teian lyre and the Irish bagpipe' and 'Irish potato seasoned with Attic salt'. In fact some of his humorous uses of classical learning appear to have been entirely original?but to prove that would require considerable research in the neglected field of neo-classical humour. At any rate, Mahony undoubtedly helped to evoke the remarkable school of classical composition which soon developed in Dublin, as will be described later. The translations of Moore and Maginn had their main success in the world of polite letters, not in academic circles. Among more scholastic works R. Traill's handsomely produced two-volume translation of Josephus' Jewish war (1847-51) was considered better than previous versions in English. Hastings Crossley's annotated edition and translation of the fourth book of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (1882) was well received139 He also trans lated Epjctetus in 1903. A. W. Quill's annotated version of the Histories of Tacitus in two volumes (1892, 1896) won commendation despite the fact that it was done in the style of an English author whom many might judge singu larly untacitean, Thomas Carlyle. S. H. Butcher, an Irishman by birth and ancestry, collaborated with Andrew Lang in what was for a long while the standard prose version of the Odyssey in English (first published in 1879). W. J. ThornhnTs painstaking translation of the Aeneid (1886) lacked distinction; but the remarks in its introduction still deserve reading. The first English version of the Harmonics of Aristoxenos was published by H. S. Macran in 1902. One of the outstanding achievements of twentieth century translators was the life-work of a gifted and dedicated Irishman?The Enneads of Plotinus by Stephen MacKenna.140 MacKenna an ardent lover of Greece ancient and modern?he fought for the Greeks against Turkey in 1897?originally experi mented with translating Marcus Aurelius and Plato. But in 1907, at the age of thirty-five he turned to Plotinus. The Enneads, a work containing great difficulties of text, language and thought, had never been entirely translated into English before. In fact no satisfactory version existed at all. Commen taries, glossaries, grammatical studies and texts were equally inadequate MacKenna completed his work in 1930, after agonising difficulties and delays. A former Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford, E. R. Dodds, has described it as 'one of the few very great translations of our day'. Translations into modern Irish No notable translation of a classical author into Irish seems to have survived from the thirteenth to the early eighteenth century. Meanwhile stricter standards of fidelity to the original had displaced the medieval freedom to 139 C. R. Haines in his translation of the Loeb edn. of Marcus Aurelius (London, 1916) says of Crossley's work 'This specimen makes us regret that the author did not publish the whole version which he tells us was in MS'. 140 j?or information about MacKenna I am largely indebted to Journal and letters of Stephen MacKenna ed. with a memoir by E. R. Dodds and a preface by Padraic Colum (London, 1936), especially pp. 42-3 and 81.</page><page sequence="40">52 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy alter and interpolate. Sometime between 1707 and 1721 Lucas Smyth of Kilkenny composed four books of translations from Greek and Latin poets, including Mimnermos, Simonides, Theocritus, Terence, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Martial and Seneca.141 In these he tried to reproduce the original metres. According to his editor the style of those classical versions is often rather unidiomatic and obscure. A version of the Song of Solomon is much more successful. Also in the first half of the eighteenth century, John 'Clarada' MacDonnell is reputed to have translated part of Homer into Irish.142 In 1772 C. Vallancey included an Irish version of the Punic speech in Plautus' Poenulus in his erudite Essay on the antiquity of the Irish language. 4fri 1844-74 John MacHale, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, produced an Irish version of the Iliad, using a metre modelled on Pope's.143 Stephen MacKenna was attracted by what he considered the Gaelic quality of Pindar, and thought of doing an Irish version of his odes.144 He also contemplated renderings of Sophocles' Antigone and of Horace's Satires and Epistles, but never completed them. More recently, in 1936, Monsignor P?draig de Brun published versions in Irish of Antigone (1926), King Oedipus (1928), Oedipus at Colonos (1929), Iphigeneia in Aulis (1935), and some of Plutarch's Lives (1936); and Professor George Thomson (Seorise Mac Laghmhainn or Seoirse Mac Thom?is) published Irish translations of Alcestis (1932), Prometheus bound (1933) and Plato's Apology, Crito and Phaedo. Classical scholarship in the seventeenth century and later Apart from Stanihurst, the more eminent scholars of the post-Reformation period in Ireland wrote mainly on ecclesiastical and theological matters. Though Archbishop James TJssher produced two minor works with classical affinities?A geographicall and historicall disquisition touching the Asia etc. (1643) and De Macedonum et Asianorum anno solari (1648),145 his chief work was not in what he called 'heathen story'.146 Next, Dudley Loftus, the celebrated orientalist, published in 1657 a translation of Aristotle's logic from the Armenian version and a general introduction to Aristotle's philosophy. In the following year an Englishman, William Hall, a former Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, who had come to Dublin as headmaster of St. Patrick's School, published his work on the Periegesis of Dionysius. Elisha Coles, who became headmaster of Galway Grammar School in 1678 was the author of popular Latin-English and English-Latin lexicons and some classical school books. *41 See Cosslett Quin, 'A specimen of Kilkenny Irish', ?igse xi (1964-6) 107-11. 142 Hyde, History etc. 600. 143 Hyde, History etc. 511.

J. Lawlor, 'Primate Ussher's Library before 1641' PRIA 3rd ser. vi (1900) 2.</page><page sequence="41">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 53 The first native Irishman after Stanihurst to win more than local reputation for sustained classical studies was Henry Dodwell, who in 1666 resigned his Fellowship in Trinity College, Dublin, and later became Camden Professor of History in Oxford. He, too, concerned himself a good deal with ecclesiastical topics, but his studies in Greek and Roman history and geography were of outstanding quality. His Discourse concerning the time of Phalaris (1704) brought him into a controversy in which three other Irishmen, Temple, Orrery and Swift, were more sharply involved.147 After Dodwell Irish classicists did much of their best work in the study of ancient history and of oratory, until the nineteeenth century. In 1753 John Gast decided that normal methods of historical presentation were too dull and tried to enliven his narrative by putting it in dialogue form, with exclamations like 'Happy, happy Athens!' and 'Infamous villain!' The effect was rather absurd, but Gast has been praised in recent times for the bold design of his work and his enlightened attitude to the modern Greeks.148 Much more celebrated in his day was Thomas Leland with his History of the life and reign of Philip, King of Maced?n (2 vols., 1758). It long remained a standard work. Before it, Leland had produced a useful edition (with John Stokes) of Demos thenes'149 Philippics (2 vols., 1754). His much reprinted translations of Demosthenes have already been noticed. His chief rival, Joseph Stock, published editions of Aeschines, Demosthenes, Tacitus, and Lucian. They won him the bishoprics of Killala and Waterford,150 but no lasting academic repute. Thomas Keightley, a very prolific writer,151 produced histories of Greece and Rome and commentaries on Latin writers. More enterprisingly he published a history of the Greek war of independence as early as 1830. Oliver Goldsmith's histories of Greece (2 vols., 1774) and Rome (2 vols., 1769) can hardly be regarded as works of scholarship.152 Macaulay's con demnation of them as being 'superficial and inaccurate' cannot be rebutted. 147 Two other Irishmen, celebrated for non-classical publications, publishod minor classical studies at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Thomas Molynoux, the philosopher, communicated a paper on the ancient lyre and Horaco, Odes iv, 3, 17-20, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 282 (Dec. 1702) 1207-78. John Toland (1670-1722), the notorious deist from Inishowen, in his 'life of unprofitable literary activity' (as Allibone calls it) wrote on Strabo, Livy and Cicero and translated Bottiche's book on coins (1696). For early but academically unimportant Irish editions of Toronce (1709), Virgil (1716), Ovid (1729), Justin (1727), etc., see L. W. Br?ggemann, A view of he English editions etc. (Stettin, 1797). 148 See Spencer 295 and Clarke, Greek stries 105. 149 On eighteenth century interest in Demosthenes see XL Schindel, Demosthenes im 18.

Keightley helped Crofton Croker in collecting Irish folktales. 152 See especially R. W. Wardle, Oliver Goldsmith (London, 1957). Goldsmith himself described his Roman history as a 'compilation for schools'. It went through 14 edns. before 1800, and was translated into French, German, Italian and Greek. The Grecian history was published posthumously in 1774, and went through 20 edns. in 50 years, and was translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish and Greek. For Samuel Johnson's high praise and accurate prediction ('Goldsmith's history will please again and again') see Boswell's Life chap, xxvii and cf. Allibone. Here is another tribute: 'Goldsmith's histories, I have since been told, are inexact and false?not near so accurate as the dry-as-dust compilations by Dr. Smith and others, that have taken their</page><page sequence="42">54 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (But the story that Goldsmith when working on his Grecian history asked Gibbon what was the name of the Indian king who gave Alexander so much trouble, and, being told 'Montezuma', believed it, sounds unlikely.) Yet their buoyant, readable style won the interest of readers who could not endure more austere studies. They were frequently reprinted, and when the Grecian history was translated into modern Greek at Vienna in 1806, it helped to stimu late feelings in favour of restoring Greek independence. That tour de force of historical rapidity, the last chapter which compresses the sixteen centuries of Greek history between the captivity of the Achaean leaders and the fall of Constantinople into ten pages, is not by Goldsmith. Meanwhile, Ireland had seen her first female classical scholar, Constantia Grierson, wife of the well-known Dublin printer. She published editions of Virgil (1724), Terence (1727), and Tacitus (1730). Edward Harwood, the classical bibliographer, gallantly described her Tacitus as 'one of the best edited books ever delivered to the world'. Since then there has been only one notable classical edition by an Irishwoman.153 An attempt to use a classical author for practical purposes in Ireland found expression in an edition of Columella's De re rustica (Dublin, 1732), produced, according to the title page, for the use of youths in the diocese of Ossory. The editor's name is not given in the copies available to the present writer. (The text is that of Stephanus.) The implicit assumption that the young farmers of County Kilkenny and its neighbourhood could and would learn from a Latin treatise is remarkable. A gifted but singularly unfortunate Irishman?after leaving the country he turned from classical studies to clipping coins and was hanged in 1749? was Usher Gahagan. He edited Catullus, Horace, Juvenal, Persius and Virgil for the well known 'Brindley's classics', and also published a Latin translation of Pope's Essay on Criticism in 1747. The opening of the Printing House in Trinity College, Dublin, in 1734 stimulated the publication of classical editions.154 For over two hundred years it continued to produce Greek and Latin classical works of varying merit. Many of them were designed for undergraduate use, and none of them won a place among the more famous classical works until the late nineteenth century when The correspondence of Gicero by Tyrrell and Purser made the dark green covers of the Dublin University Press familiar throughout the classical world. Its first publication, a handsome edition of seven dialogues of Plato, in 1738, place in the hands of boys; notwithstanding which, had I to choose, in the education of a boy, I should bring him up on Goldsmith; who would give him life and poetry, fire and spirit, and whoe errors might be corrected afterwards.'

(Oxford, 1966) at 'Greek' and 'Latin'. 153 Hazel Hornsby, Aulus Gellius: Noctium Atticarum liber i (Dublin, 1936). 154 See J. W. Stubbs, The history of the University of Dublin from 1591 to 1800 (Dublin, 1889) 180-1. One of the most prolific early editors was John Hawkey who produced edns of Horace, Juvenal, Persius, Sallust, Terence and Virgil, which Dibdin (ii, 109) praised for their accuracy (cf. ibid. 156, 476). J. Walker's Livy (1797) had some reputation.

The latter part of the eighteenth and the earlier decades of the nineteenth century produced few classical books of note by professional scholars. It was, on the other hand, the heyday of dilettanti writers, most notably Robert Wood, who will be considered later. One of these gifted amateurs, Lord Charlemont, founded the Royal Irish Academy in 1785, which encouraged shorter publica tions. Some useful monographs appeared in its earlier volumes. Gradually the more rigorous methods of the continental scholars began to have effect in Ireland. But the standard in literature remained amateurish for a while, to judge from a letter of Cardinal Newman in December 1854. Writing in connection with the recruitment of staff for his new Catholic University he remarked : 'The only department in which the Irish are not equal or are in ferior to the English is that of classical literature'.157 Belfast produced its first noteworthy contribution to classical studies in 1827.158 This was William Bruce's The state of society in the age of Homer. Though eclipsed eventually by Mahaffy's Greek social life from Homer to Menan der (1874) it deserves credit for its early emphasis on non-political and non military history. The most distinguished Ulster classicist of the nineteenth century, Sir Samuel Dill,159 wrote in the same tradition in his three notable books on Roman society (1898, 1904, 1926). The second half of the nineteenth century witnessed a remarkable efflores cence of classical studies in Dublin. Its first notable manifestation was Lectures on the history of ancient philosophy by a young scholar destined to a premature death, William Archer Butler,160 Professor of Moral Philosophy in Dublin University. It was published in two volumes by W. H. Thompson in 1856, after Butler's death, at the age of thirty-four, in 1848. Butler's successors added some useful contributions, notably Thomas Maguire in his edition of the Parmenides (1882), two volumes of essays on Plato (1866 and 1870), and 155 Words and short phrases in Greek type had been in use in Ireland since 1622 when it appeared in Sir Christopher Sibthorp's A friendly advertisement etc.: see E. H. McC. Dix PRIA xxviii (1910) C 149-156. According to the same authority the earliest book printod in Latin in Ireland was the medical treatise Pathologia haereditaria generalis etc. by Dormod Meara (or O'Meara) in 1619. Musarum lachrymae (Dublin, 1630) contains three poems in Greek, as well as three in Hebrew and several in Latin. For classical books in general printed in Dublin before 1800 see M. J.

W. H. Ferrar published the first volume of a comparative grammar of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin in 1869, and James Byrne produced General principles of the structure of languages (2 vols., 1885} and a rather unscientific Origin of the Greek, Latin and Gothic roots (1888), while John Keils Ingram (who became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1846 and was credited with being the teacher who chiefly inspired the classical revival there163) wrote some useful papers on etymologies. It is arguable that the polyglot style of Joyce's Finnegans wake originated from reading a Schoolbook containing etymological notes by a student from this school.164 But it also has affinities with the macaronic verses favoured by Irishmen from early times. Two publications in 1874 marked the beginning of a remarkably rich era of classical studies in Ireland. These were Arthur Palmer's edition of the Heroides of Ovid and Mahaffy's Greek social life as mentioned above. Palmer, by birth a Canadian, came to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1859 at the age of eighteen and remained on as Scholar and Fellow until his death in 1897. By common consent he was one of the most gifted classical men of his time. He published valuable editions of Propertius, Horace's Satires, Catullus and Plautus' Amphitryon, and made lasting contributions to textual emendation in Aristophanes and Bacchylides. A. E. Housman's magisterial praise and blame of his work is well known : . . . Among the critics who have emended Ovid's Heroides since the time of Heinsius the first place belongs to Bentley, the second to Palmer, and the third to Madvig . . . The list of Palmer's emendations which I should call certain or nearly so ... is not indeed a long one ; it will not compare with what he effected in Propertius or even in Bacchylides. But in Pro pertius, where his achievement equalled Baehrens' and surpassed Lachmann's, there was much more to be done; and as for Bacchylides, skimming the first cream off a new-found author is only child's-play beside gleaning after Bentley over a stubble where Heinsius has reaped. There is much to censure in this edition [of the Heroides'], so I begin with this tribute : no critic of the century has purified the text so much, and no critic but Madvig so brilliantly. In width and in minuteness of learning, in stability of judgment, and even in what is now the rarest of the virtues, precision of thought, he had superiors among his countrymen and con temporaries : in some of these things many excelled him, some excelled him far, and Munro excelled him far in all. But that will not disguise from posterity and ought not to disguise from us that Palmer was a man more 161 Maguire's Notes on the Agamemnon of Aeschylus (1868) is cited with implicit approval by E. Fraenkel in his Agamemnon on 11. 3 and 83 ff.

But his four volume History of Greek classical literature was the best in English for many years, and his studies in Hellenistic history were outstanding in their day and won high praise. Also his two volumes of the P?trie papyri (Dublin, 1891-2) were a notable achievement. Among his admirers were Schliemann, Theodore Reinach, Wilamowitz, and Henry Jackson of Cambridge. Among his many enemies and detractors were Jebb and Gildersleeve. As a Hellenist he was certainly among the most influential and most original in an age of eminent Hellenists. R. Y. Tyrrell,167 a year junior to Palmer, edited the Bacchae and Troades of Euripides, the Miles gloriosus of Plautus, and produced texts of Sophocles and Terence, as well as an elegant book on Latin poetry, and many brilliant compositions in Greek and Latin verse. He collaborated with his younger colleague, Louis Claude Purser, in the monumental Correspondence of Cicero. He also, with Mahaffy, was one of the four founding editors of Hermathena in 1874, a journal which has published some of the best work of Trinity College scholars. Purser,168 too, was a scholar of uncommon merit, as may be seen from his edition of Apuleius' Cupid and Psyche, his Oxford Text of Cicero's Epistulae and his miscellaneous writings. He did the bulk of the work in the later volumes of Cicero's Correspondence, and his readiness to go to vast trouble in helping the work of others was widely recognised. J. B. Bury became a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, four years after Purser. His reputation as an historian of the later Roman empire needs no emphasis here. In the earlier part of his career he also wrote on literary topics. In fact, when he was still an undergraduate he produced in 1881 a far from negligible edition of Euripides' Hippolytus (with a new collation of the Lauren tian ms) in collaboration with Mahaffy. He edited Pindar's Nemean and Isthmian odes in 1890 and 1892. His History of Greece remains (with recent supplementation) one of the best of its kind, and he was the first editor of the Cambridge Ancient History. As a strong advocate of the more austere historical school,169 his work stands in marked contrast with the more humanistic?even artistic?historiography of his college tutor, Mahaffy. 165 CE xiii (1899) 172. 166 Mahaffy's classical publications are discussed in detail in a book due to be pub lished in 1971 by R. B. McDowell and W. B. Stanford. !67 For Tyrrell's work see Hermathena xl (1914) v-xvi and PBA vii (1915-16) 533-9. ?es See A. C.

Next came W. J. M. Starkie, who in the comparatively short period which he gave to classical studies produced massively erudite editions of Aristophanes' Wasps (1897), Acharnians (1909) and Clouds (1911). J. G. Smyly, another Dubliner to be praised by Housman,170 is best known for his papyrological work, which will be mentioned later. He also published valuable work on problems in Greek astronomy and mathematics.171 An older contemporary of his who afterwards specialised in Hegelian philosophy, HS. Macran, courageously?and with considerable success?edited one of the most abstruse of Greek treatises, the Harmonics of Aristoxenos (1902). G. W. Mooney ably edited Apollonius Rhodius, Lycophron, and (less satisfactorily) some of Suetonius, and compiled an index to Lucan. Next, E. H. Alton published some distinguished papers on Ovid,172 his greatest scholastic triumph being the re-valuation of the Z-readings and of the Y manuscript in the textual tradition of Ovid's Fasti (of which he intended to produce a full-scale edition).173 Alton's colleague, W. A. Goligher, wrote on Greek history and oratory and is mentioned in the introduction to the latest edition of Liddell and Scott for his lexicographical help. Besides this remarkable galaxy in one college, elsewhere there were several other Irish scholars of more than local reputation. Two professors of the Queen's University, Belfast, have already been mentioned, Hastings Crossley and Sir Samuel Dill. In the next generation, R. M. Henry174 and T. A. Sinclair175 were eminent in Latin and Greek studies respectively. In University College, Dublin, Gerard Manley Hopkins was Professor of Greek, 1884-9,176 but though his letters of the time suggest many promising lines of research177 he published nothing of academic value in classics. His successor, Henry Browne, published a good Handbook of Homeric study in 1905. University College, Cork, had its most eminent classical scholar in Sir William Ridgeway (a graduate of Dublin University) who was Professor of Greek there before he became Disney Pro fessor of Archaeology in Cambridge, where a colleague described him as 'a 170 In the introduction to vol. v of his Manilius he says that the only competent criticism of Garrod's edition was Smyly's. 171 See J. G. Smy]y, Index etc. 172 See Smyly's Index. This work should also be consulted for references to the many articles published in Hermathena by the other classical scholars from T.C.D. mentioned in this section. i7* See H. xliv (1926) 101-18 and xiv (1930) 371-85. 174 He edited An Irish Corpus Astronomiae (1913) with F. W. O'Connell, and Livy xxvi (1905). 175 His most notable publications were A history of classical Greek literature (1931), A history of Greek political thought (1962), and an edition of Hesiod's Works and days (1932). 176 See A page of Irish history: Story of University College, Dublin 1883?1909, compiled by Fathers of the Society of Jesus (Dublin, 1930). *77See C. C. Abbott's edn. of his correspondence (3 vols. Oxford 1935 and 1938). The Dublin letters have much to say of other Dublin scholars. (He describes Tyrrell as. 'a fine scholar and an amiable man, free from every touch of pedantry' ; but he does not refer to Mahaffy.) He writes of many classical publications which he intended to produce including a book on 'the Dorian measure'. He shows particular interest in Pindar and Aeschylus. For possible influences by the latter on his own poetry see W. B.

But his work on Greek pre-history and early currency, and his Origin and influence of the thoroughbred horse (1905) won him a high reputation. C. H. Keene, also a professor in Cork, edited the De reditu of Rutilius Namatianus, the Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and Nemesianus, the Electra of Euripides, and other classical works. Another scholar in the same College, W. H. Porter, published the first annotated edition in English of Plutarch's lives of Aratos and Dion, as well as an edition of the Rhesus. At St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, J. F. D'Alton, later Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, wrote two books of lasting value, Horace and his age (1917) and Roman literary theory and criticism (1931). J. F. Da vies, Latin Professor in the Queen's College, Galway, is best known for editions of Aeschylus' Agamemnon, Choephoroe and Eumenides. As Professor of Ancient Classics in the same College Thomas Dempsey produced a useful book on the Delphic oracle (1918), and his successor, Thomas Fahy, edited the Octavius of Minucius Felix in 1919. The scientist D'Arcy W. Thompson, who published glossaries of Greek birds and Greek fishes, besides a translation of Aristotle's Historia Animalium, was the son of a colourful Galway Professor of Greek. Charles Exon, who held the chair of Latin there is remembered chiefly for 'Exon's laws of syncope'.179 Outside the universities there were notable scholars, too. H. E. Allen's editions of Cicero's philosophical works (183^-56) are among the very few Irish publications noticed in Sandys' chapter on nineteenth century classical scholarship. Allen also wrote ably on several other Latin authors. Sandys also notices that remarkable feat of erudition by a Dublin medical doctor, James Henry's Aeneidea, or critical, exegetical and aesthetical remarks on the Aeneis etc. in four volumes (1873-92, the last three being published posthumously under the supervision of J. F. Davies, Arthur Palmer and L. C. Purser). An enthusiast for Virgil from the age of eleven, Henry travelled through Europe, crossing the Alps seventeen times, in search of Virgilian lore. He personally examined every manuscript of importance, as he has described in his Notes of a twelve years' voyage of discovery in the first six books of the Aeneis (1853). Subsequent editors of the Aeneid have praised his enormous commentary very highly. His separately published translations of Virgil, as already men tioned, were curiously tortuous. There were also able scholars among Irish schoolmasters in this period. M. M'Kay of Kinsale Endowed School produced a painstaking edition of selected speeches of Cicero, in 1833, and some translations later. In 1840 J. R. Darley of the Royal School, Dungannon, published a very informative work entitled The Grecian drama: a treatise on the dramatic literature of the Greeks. T. D. Hincks of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution compiled a Greek-English 178 x. R. Glover, Cambridge retrospect (Cambridge, 1943) 76. See also R. S. Conway in DNB, and PBA xii (1926) 327-36. 179 See H xxxii (1906) 117 ff., and R. S. Conway, The making of Latin (London, 1922) 45.</page><page sequence="48">60 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy lexicon (1843) and wrote a book on ancient geography. At Foyle College, Derry, M.C. Hime produced useful introductions to Greek and Latin 1878-93. J. Thompson of the High School, Dublin, published a full-scale Greek grammar in 1902. The Dublin school of scholars of the nineteenth century excelled in a minor branch of the classical tradition which at that time was regarded by many as the chief criterion of accomplished learning and taste?the art of classical composition, especially verse composition. As has been already illustrated, this art had been practised by Irish scholars from the early medieval period : but the earlier versifiers almost exclusively practised free composition.180 An Irishman to show outstanding skill in rendering modern passages into Greek and Latin in the early nineteenth century was 'Father Prout', who has already been mentioned .181 Thirty years later the Dublin school of neoclassical versifiers excelled in this derivative but exacting art. Even a description of a cricket match was not considered beyond their scope. The earliest publication of the Dublin school was a small, but elegant, volume, Hesperidum susurri (London, 1867) by T. J. B. Brady, R. Y. Tyrrell and M. C. Cullinan. In 1869 they and others launched a special journal entitled Kottabos,182 with Tyrrell as general editor, which continued through fifty numbers to print a multi-lingual variety of original and imitative verse. Its classical contributors included Bury, Davies, Maguire, Mahaffy, Palmer, Tyrrell and Oscar Wilde. As an example of its quality one may quote the opening lines of Tyrrell's version (in the original metre) of Hood's description of the drowned girl in his Bridge of Sighs) : ah, misera sortis, pondere fessa! ah, temer? mortis viam ingressai tollite facile onus tarn bellum, corpus tarn gracile, tamque tenellum. panni gravatum cadaver astringunt, vestes elatum ceu f?nebres cingunt, undam stillantes heu! illaetabilem. statist amantes ferte amabilem. ne fastidientes corpus attingite, sed flebilem fientes animo fingite . . . 180 For some post-medieval classical compositions see e.g. H. Bradshaw's Catalogue of the Bradshaw collection of Irish boohs in the University of Cambridge, E. M. Dix, Catalogue of early Dublin printed boohs at 1630, 1658, 1661, 1663 and 1700, and Corkery 265. 181 See n. 138. i82 Most of the best pieces from Kottabos are re-published in Dublin translations into Greek and Latin verse edited by R. Y. Tyrrell (Dublin, 1890) and Echoes from Kottabos edited by R. Y. Tyrrell and Edward Sullivan (London, 1906). The pieces cited are in Echoes etc. 311 and 279-90 and 311-25, and Kottabos x (1872) 285. 'Kottabistae' continued for a while in The Dublin University Review and Hermathena (where they still occasionally appear).</page><page sequence="49">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 61 Perhaps no Irishman since Sedulius had written such supple and graceful .Latin verse as Tyrrell and a few of his contemporaries?and as for Greek verse, there is no evidence that it was ever before written in Ireland with such elegance and variety as it was by these Dublin stylists. One may doubt, indeed, if since the last poems of the Greek Anthology were composed any Greek epigram has been written with greater concinnity than Tyrrell's couplet on Matthew Arnold's over-use of the unS?v ocyav principle : 'Mn??v ?yav' uj?veis* ayav viv?is* o? toi ?rjyeis* cb 'yct?k, lanS?v ?yav, nn?? t? '[xrfizv ?yav\ (In a rough translation of its close-knit texture : 'Avoid excess' you've preached till you've annoyed Even those friends who praise sobriety. Why not match deed with preaching and avoid Preaching 'Avoid excess' excessively?) Several other pieces, short and long, by other authors besides Tyrrell show almost as much felicity and ingenuity. Prose parodies of classical styles were also included, the most famous being R. F. Littledale's highly convincing proof that the chief exponent of the solar theory of the origin of Greek myth ology, the redoubtable Max M?ller, was himself a solar myth. Though these were no more than jeux d'esprit, playthings of an age when classical studies and university life in general had much more leisure than they have now, the degree of sheer erudition and literary insight necessary to construct them effectively was very high. The art continued to be practised in Trinity College until the 1940s183 when the abolition of verse composition as a compulsory subject in classical examinations led to its virtual extinction. A more serious genre of composition, however, still retains a place in the public ceremonies of that foundation?the Latin speeches of the Public Orator at the conferring of honorary degrees. Two volumes of these have been published.184 Brief mention should, perhaps, be added here about some scholars of Irish origin who spent most of their life in other countries. Sir Richard Jebb, cele brated for his exemplary edition of Sophocles, belonged to a family which had been in Ireland since the early eighteenth century. His home was in Killiney, Co. Dublin, and his early education was at St. Columba's College, Rathfarnham. As a young man in Cambridge he was described as ?a purely Celtic genius, like a flame of fire'.185 Others of Irish parentage and early life were A. D. 183 The latest volume of classical verse compositions to bo publishod by an Irish scholar was Carmina Dublinensia by Sir Robert W. Tato (Dublin, 1946), which contains the celebrated tour deforce on a cricket match (pp. 24-5). L. J, D. Richardson's fragment of a fictitious Greek tragedy in iambic and lyric verse (484 linos) has boon published in Euphrosyne i (1957) 461-74, and his account of the Indian mutiny in Horodotoan prose has been published by Blackwell (Oxford, 1926, 36 pp.). Another notable piece of classical composition is a verse translation of Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage by tho Rev. N. J. Brennan, President of Rockwell College, Cashel, entitled 'Terra paterna, vale'. (Dublin, 1901). X84 Speeches of public orators etc. (by Palmer, Tyrrell and Pursor) od. R. Y.

H. Butcher, translator of the Odyssey and editor of Aristotle's Poetics, and Alexander Leeper translator of Juvenal. Gilbert Murray, though born in Australia, educated in England, and never resident in Ireland, seems to have regarded himself as an Irishman.186 His successor as Regius Professor of Greek in Oxford, E. R. Dodds, is Irish by birth, parentage and early education. Irish contacts with Gkeek lands As already noticed the Irish heroic narratives and folklore tales sometimes described visitors from Ireland to Greece and from Greece to Ireland.187 But that belongs to the world of myths. Suggestions that some of the early Irish scholars travelled as far as Greece have not been proved. Besides, the interest of travellers in the medieval period was not in, the classical epochs of Greece. For them 'Greece' meant the Byzantine empire rather than th? classical sites. Constantinople and the holy places which lay beyond it were the magnets for pilgrims, not Athens, Delphi or Olympia. Pagan antiquities, where visible, were considered irrelevant to the spiritual purposes of the visitors. The journey to Jerusalem was often made by the overland route via Vienna and the Danube, and Irish hostels are known to have been established on the way. Travellers on this route would not see any of the classical sites of European Greece, though the especially erudite pilgrim might have taken notice of the Troad, Smyrna, and some of the Greek islands. The earliest record of a medieval Irishman who visited the eastern Medi terranean areas (Adamn?n's information on Palestine being secondhand) seems to be that of MacGiolla Caoimh (Mac Gilla Keefe) who is said to have visited the north of Greece about 1000 A.D. in search, it seems, of the site of Paradise.188 Next is the poet Muireadhach Albanach who visited the Holy Land in the early thirteenth century.189 A poem written by him aboard ship in the Adriatic survives. He presumably saw something of Greece. About the same time, probably, a certain 'Gilbride of Scotland', who may have been an Irishman in origin, wrote a poem on a voyage between Greece and Egypt, including the phrase 'Let us leave the foot-hills of the stormy peaks of Greece and make for Damietta.' 186 See Gilbert Murray, An unfinished autobiography (London, 1960) 108 (in a letter of Feb., 1900) 'Really we Irish are a rum lot'. (There is no entry in the index for any of the references to Ireland.) On p. 37 Murray referring to his Co* Limerick father's interest in the classics mentions that he had once won a prize for Greek iambics presented by 'some authority in Dublin'. It was probably one of the premiums founded by the Board of Trinity College in 1776 to encourage composition in Greek, Latin, and English, in Irish Schools. Additional note: the following are some other Irish authors of classical studies (whose books are listed in the catalogues of the libraries of the British Museum and of Trinity College, Dublin): J. G. D. Dowdall, T. W. Dougan, W. B. Drury, J. E. Gilmore, T. D. Hincks, A. Leeper, G. Miller, J. A. Nairn, F. H. Ringwood, T. W. Rolleston, T. G. Rylands, M. T. Smiley, C. S.

O'Grady, Catalogue etc.</page><page sequence="51">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 63 But these are only passing references. The first detailed descriptions of Greek lands as seen by an Irish traveller occur in the Itinerarium Symonis Semeonis ab Hybernia ad Terram Sanctam.190 Symon was a Franciscan friar, a native, apparently of southern or central Ireland, who travelled from Dublin to Jerusalem in 1323. Among the Greek regions that he saw on his way were the Ionian Islands, the west and south coasts of the P?loponn?se, and Crete. He has much of interest to say about the contemporary conditions of the Greeks, but seems to have been entirely oblivious of classical antiquity. Another Franciscan, 'Brother James of Ireland', apparently traversed some Greek territory on his journey to China, beginning in 1316.191 But no record of his experiences there has survived. Considering how much lasting popularity there was in Ireland for stories about travel,192 one may find it surprising that three centuries elapse before the next recorded visit by Irishmen to the near east. (There were Gaelic versions of the travels of Pr?ster John,193 Marco Polo and Mande ville.) The next Irishman after Symon to leave an account of his travels in Asia, Africa, and European Turkey is John Baptist Burke, titular Abbot of Clare and Vicar Apostolic of Killala in the second half of the seventeenth century.194 From the beginning of the eighteenth century onwards two historical developments, one in Turkey, the other in Ireland, changed the nature and purposes of Irish travellers in classical lands.195 By 1717 the Turks had recon quered the P?loponn?se from the Venetians, and soon afterwards as a result of the treaty of Passarowitz between Turkey, Venice and Austria in 1718, peace was restored in eastern Europe and the Aegean. The British Govern ment had played the chief part as mediator. Consequently, British prestige was high in Turkey, and English-speaking travellers were cordially received. In Ireland the Williamite settlement had brought prosperity and security to the religious minority, and their richer scions began to travel further afield. At the same time, the revival of interest in classical antiquity, combined with a belief among Protestants, that pilgrimages to the holy places of Christianity were 'superstitious', altered the motives of this new type of traveller from Ireland to Greek lands: religious piety and spiritual improvement were re placed by antiquarian enquiry and gentlemanly self-cultivation. i90 See Esposito Itinerarium etc. 5. 191 See Beazley iii, 255 ff.

This was his Description of the East and some other countries, of which the first volume appeared in 1743, the second in 1745. Handsomely illustrated with architectural and botanical engravings, it soon became celebrated and was translated into French, German and Dutch. It included descriptions of the Greek mainland, the islands, and Asia Minor. At Troy he correctly identified Hissarlik as the site of the ancient city, and it may well be that his description inspired the young Robert Wood to go there on his epoch-making visit a few years later. Pococke also published two volumes of inscriptions which he had copied,196 and brought home a 'curious collection' of Greek and Roman coins.197 The foundation in London of the Society of Dilettanti (probably in 1732), with its toast of 'Grecian taste and Roman spirit' stimulated the revival of interest in classical art and architecture. Three of its first members (and many others subsequently) were of Irish family, Lord Boyne, Lord Galway, and William Ponsonby, afterwards Earl of Bessborough. According to the historian of the Society,198 Ponsonby was one of its 'ruling spirits', and 'as a collector of objects of art and antiquity one of the earliest and most active in the country'. He accompanied the Earl of Sandwich on his voyage to the Greek islands, Athens, Constantinople and Smyrna, but he published no account of his ex periences there. More influentially, in 1749, James Caulfeild, fourth Viscount and first Earl of Charlemont (who founded the Royal Irish Academy in 1785) followed him,199 in company with two other Irishmen?Francis Pierpoint Burton (later Lord Conyngham), and his classical tutor, the Rev. Edward Murphy, as well as the artist Richard Dalton (whose engravings, published in 1751, eleven years before those of Stuart and Revett gave the English and Irish public their first clear impression of the sculptures of the Parthenon and of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus). Charlemont took his duties as a traveller very seriously, transcribing inscriptions and later publishing papers 196 Inscriptionum antiquarum Graecarum et Latinarum liber and a supplementary volume (London, 1752) with the help of Jeremiah Milles. 197 A catalogue of a curious collection of Greek, Roman, and English coins and medals of the Bight Reverend Dr. Rococke, Lord Bishop of Meath, collected by his lordship during his travels (dated 27 and 28 May, 1766): in the T.C.D. Library. The sale catalogue of his books (in the National Library) contains many classical items. Pococke also wrote on Irish antiquities. 198 Lionel Oust and Sidney Colvin, History of the Society of Dilettanti (London, 1914); see also Sir Cecil Harcourt-Smith, The Society of Dilettanti : its regalia and pictures (London, 1931). 199 j?or Charlemont's travels in general see Spencer 159-60 and Francis Hardy's Memoirs of Gharlemont (2nd edn.

This was Robert Wood,202 born at Riverstown Castle, Co. Meath, about 1717. (No further details of his early life are known.) He first travelled to Greek lands in 1742-3. In 1750 he joined James Dawkins (a young Dilettante), John Bouverie, and an Italian artist named Borra, on a further expedition, this time visiting Palmyra,203 Baalbec (where Pococke had preceded him) and (again in Pococke's footsteps) the Troad. Wood stated that one of his principal aims was ?to read the Iliad and the Odyssey in the countries where Achilles fought, where Ulysses travelled, and where Homer sung'. They landed at the Troad on 5 July 1750. There Wood collected the material for his Comparative view of the ancient and present state of the Troad (published in 1767) which helped Schliemann in his discovery of Troy. Equally important, Wood prefaced this work with his Essay on the original genius of Homer. This was studied by the German scholar Friedrich August Wolf before he completed his Prolegomena ad Homerum in 1795, the work which began that vast scholastic wrangle?rich in positive achievements as well as in controversial acerbities?known as the Homeric problem. Wolf fairly acknowledged his debts to Wood's ingeniosa audacia in this celebratissimus liber (which Goethe also praised in a review). The leading Hellenist of Germany in the later nineteenth century, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-MoellendorfF, ranked Wood's essay as an achievement even more influential than Bentley's rediscovery of the digamma.204 Wood's book had a fashionable success in its time, being translated into German, French, Italian and Spanish. The next group of Irish travellers to Greece went for less peaceful reasons. The Napoleonic war and the Greek war of independence drew them.

After that he tried to unite the Greek factions, spending much of his private income in promoting the Greek cause, and he strongly opposed the British policy of non-intervention. Finlay, the historian, describes him as 'the first public advocate of the Greek cause among Englishmen in an influential capacity' and adds that 'he deserves to be ranked among the greatest benefactors of Greece'.206 (The opinion of the Greeks themselves was far from unanimous on this : but he had a street named after him in Athens.) Sir Richard Church, son of a Quaker merchant in the city of Cork,207 began his remarkable career as a philhellene while serving as an officer in the British military force which captured the Ionian Islands in 1809. Subsequently he recruited and organised a force of Suliote Greeks for the defence of that area. This was disbanded by order of the British Government, in order to avoid offending Turkey, in 1815. In 1827 Church accepted an invitation to join the Greek army and was elected generalissimo, and conducted several campaigns. He resigned later in protest against the conduct of Capo DTstria. He was British Resident in Cythera for a while and in 1830 he protested in a pamphlet against the exclusion of Acarnania and Aetolia (which he had liberated) from Greek sovereignty. In 1832 the frontier was revised to include them. He lived on in Greece as a staunch defender of liberty against King Otho's despotism. After the constitutional revolution in 1843 he became a member of the Greek Senate and in 1854 a general in the army. When he died in 1873, he was honoured with a public funeral and a monument in Athens. Hamilton met him in Greece and described him in a letter as 'certainly a fine fellow, but a complete Irishman, with their great virtues and faults'.208 Sir George Ferguson Bowen, son of a rector in Co. Donegal, was appointed president of the short-lived University of Corfu in 1847 and remained there four years. His publication Ithaca in 1850 in which he argued that Corfu was the Homeric Ithaca, won some repute. In 1852 he published an account of journeys in Greece and Turkey. In 1854 he became chief secretary to the Governor of the Ionian Islands. When the question of the transfer of the islands to Greece arose in the 1860s he advocated the transfer of the southern islands only, on the grounds that the rest were more Italian than Greek. Sir Thomas Wyse of the well known Co. Waterford family was appointed British Minister at Athens in 1846. On his death there, after distinguished service to both Britain and Greece, he was honoured with a state funeral. He wrote two books about Greece, Excursions in the P?loponn?se (1856) and Impressions of Greece (1871). 206 gee Tozer's edn. of Finlay's history (1877) 301 and cf. 300, 370, 420-1. 207 Mrs. Olive Goodbody has kindly confirmed from the records of the Society of Friends in Ireland that he was born in Cork 23 Nov., 1784, a fact not stated in the DNB or in the life by Stanley Lane-Poole (London, 1890) or in E.

Church's Chapters in an adventurous life (Edinburgh, 1895). 208 In a letter to Stratford Canning from Poros, 19 April, 1827.</page><page sequence="55">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 67 Other persons of Irish origin or residence who had some influence in the Greek struggle for independence and its sequels may be briefly mentioned: George Canning, the statesman, as British Foreign Minister tried to mediate between Greece, Turkey and Russia. His cousin Stratford Canning, first Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, was first secretary of the British embassy at Constantinople in 1809-10 and in 1825 returned as ambassador there to act as a mediator between Turkey, Russia and the Greeks. He was the chief force in winning extended frontiers for Greece in 1832. Re-appointed ambassa dor at Constantinople in 1841, he remained in that office for sixteen years. He encouraged archaeological exploration in Turkish territories, paying for Layard to go to Nineveh and helping Newton at Halicarnassus (and securing the frieze from there for the British Museum). His Irish predecessor at Constantinople, John Ponsonby, had also held an appointment in the Ionian Islands. Sir Charles James Napier, who served in the Ionian Islands and Greece as a field officer 1819-21 and became British Resident in Cephallonia in 1822, spent his youth at Celbridge: his father, an officer of the British army was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and read a paper on gunpowder to it in 1788. Also a member of the Academy and resident for a long while in Ireland, was Joseph Ellison Portlock, the geologist who served with the Royal Engineers in Corfu in 1843. These were all men of ?the establishment'. In sharp contrast was an Irish visitor to Greece in 1856, Smith O'Brien on his return from exile in Australia. The Greek government at that time went to some trouble in trying to persuade him that rumours of lawlessness were untrue. To quote a contemporary: Becoming violently Philhellenic and devoted to the Greek Government, he would not believe in the existence of brigandage or any or the evils so much complained of. Finally he made a tour in the interior, when orders were sent to all the authorities to hide all defects, and to take the utmost precaution to prevent his being captured by the robbers, who abounded in the districts he intended to travel through. On his return to Athens he published a letter eulogising the state of the country and denying the grievances alluded to, but unluckily a secret report to the authorities got into the papers at the same time, and revealed the systematic deceit which had been practised on him.209 Other Irishmen found material for books in visits to Greek lands. In 1829 a physician from Dublin published his Travels in Turkey, Egypt, Nubia and Palestine: 1824-1827 (London, 1829), with a curious frontispiece of the author in his 'Syrian dress' taking the pulse of a delicate feminine hand through an almost closed door. He wisely kept away from mainland Grooco, visiting Constantinople, the Troad and Smyrna. There is a strong sense of indignation at the sufferings of the Greeks under the Turks in his remarks. Similar feelings were to be expressed by him later about his own country, for the writer was R. R. Madden, best known now for his books on the United Irishmen. Other Irish writers on Greece in the earlier part of the nineteenth century were W. E. Fitzmaurice, Michael J. Quin, the Marquess and the Marchioness of 209 Editor's note in Impressions of Greece by Sir Thomas Wyse (London, 1871) 124.</page><page sequence="56">68 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Londonderry, Sir William Wilde, Aubrey de Ver?, the Rev. Walter Colton, and Viscountess Strangford. Three adventurous women, described as 'Fanny, Emma and myself in the account of their journey, were in Greece in 1838-9. The most successful publication of this kind was J. P. Mahaffy's Rambles and studies in Greece, a lively, well-informed and often highly original account of people, antiquities and scenery. First published in 1876, it lasted through eleven reprints in the following forty years. Another well-known writer (but not about Greece), Lafcadio Hearn was born in Leukas?hence his name?in 1850. His Irish father, Charles Bush Hearn, was a surgeon-major in the British forces in West Greece. Miss Edith Somerville, the Irish novelist, was born in Corfu in 1858. Later in the century, in 1897, Stephen MacKenna, already mentioned as the translator of Plotinus, fought in Greece against the Turks in Thessaly. He intended to continue the struggle in Crete later, but was prevented. Shortly afterwards another Irishman played a very influential part in the emancipation of Crete, first acting as an intermediary between the Cretan insurgents and the Greek government and later becoming confidential adviser to Prince George of Greece as high commissioner there after 1900. This was J. D. Bourchier, a gold medallist in Classics of Dublin University, who was born in Bruff, Co. Limerick in 1850. As the representative of the Timesy first in Athens, then in Sofia, he acquired a remarkable influence in Balkan affairs. In 1911-12 he acted as a confidential negotiator between the Greek and Bulgarian governments. He devoted the last years of his life to efforts towards creating a lasting peace in the Balkans. The writer of his biography in the Dictionary of national biography remarks : 'His sympathy with patriots and with the oppressed, to gether with his honesty of purpose, fearlessness, and power of identifying himself with a cause, won for him a unique place in the Balkan Peninsula'* He was a worthy successor to Hamilton, Church, Bowen and Wyse. The movement of travel between Ireland and Greece in this period was not entirely in one direction, A Greek emigrant, who had fought at Missolonghi, came to Ireland?the first to be recorded since the bishop in the fifteenth century so far as the present writer has yet found?and left an unusual memorial of his patriotism. This was a certain Basil Zula.210 He came to Dublin in 1829, was converted to the Moravian faith by a zealous missionary (whom he married), and became minister of that church at Kilwarlin near Hillsborough, Co. Down. There he constructed as an emblem of Greek courage a replica of the landscape at Thermopylae with mounds and a pond to represent Mount Oeta and the Maliac Gulf. He also cultivated and trimmed box hedges in the shape of Greek letters. His portrait is preserved in Kilwarlin manse. The victory of the Greeks in 1830 (their western frontier being considerably extended in the final settlement largely as the result of Church's efforts) in volved two other Irishmen briefly, and in one case rather ludicrously. When 210 For information about Zula I am specially indebted to Miss Valda Boydell, who examined the records of the Moravian Church in Ireland, the Rev. L. Taylor, Sir Douglas Savory, and Dr. Hugh Shields who kindly provided me with an excellent map of the site. Dr. Shields in 1956 saw the remains of two of the Greek letters (O and perhaps B), but these were not visible when I visited the site on 25 October 1958.</page><page sequence="57">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 69 the problem of finding a suitable and acceptable king arose, a man from Co. Wexford who called himself Nicholas Macdonald Sarsfield Cod'd (not a very uncommon name in south-eastern Ireland, but usually spelt without an apos trophe), Le Comte de Sarsfield, wrote two letters (now in the Public Record Office in London), one to Lord Palmerston, the other to Lord Aberdeen, claim ing to be the legitimate heir of the Palaeologi and the rightful pretender to the Greek throne. To substantiate his claim he enclosed a pedigree thirty-six pages long, a 'Proclamation to the government and the people of Greece', a letter to 'King Wilim iv' promising a faithful alliance between their kingdoms, and a dossier of testimonials from parish priests, the Mayor of Wexford, and other worthy citizens.211 Another Irishman was a candidate for the throne of Greece in 1863 when Otho had become unacceptable. The Proven?al poet Mistral strongly advo cated William Bonaparte Wyse, son of Sir Thomas Wyse. Mistral pleaded that Wyse was 'the only man who can give to Greece guarantee of liberty, glory and happiness .... He knows Greek better than any of the candidates proposed hitherto, and perhaps better than the Academics of Athens, Argos and Corinth. He has translated and commented on Lycophron ... he is thirty years of age, he is as handsome as Apollo of Delphi, and he is ignorant of his candidature'. But Greece and the Great Powers preferred a Prince of Denmark, and Wyse had to be content with the honour of being High Sheriff of Co. Waterford. Classical works or art and literary material collected by Irishmen in Greece In one of the early Irish heroic narratives the Sons of Tuirean went to Greece and brought the magical pig-skin of Tuis, the Greek king, back to Ireland. But so far as the world of fact is concerned the first records of secular objects brought by travellers from Greece and Italy to Ireland are in the eighteenth century, when dilettanti travellers collected antiques to adorn their residences. Among those already mentioned, Ponsonby kept the bulk of his collection in England. But Pococke, Charlemont, Hervey and others brought theirs to Ireland. No complete survey of these has yet been made.212 One collection still lies in the depths of Killiney Bay, Co. Dublin. There in 1806 a ship containing antiques collected or purchased by Lord Clon curry in Rome was wrecked in a violent storm.213 No inventory of its contents has yet been discovered. Since Cloncurry had been granted a licence by the Pope to dig in the Baths of Titus some new finds may have been included. He also bought some pieces from Hervey in Rome. Other antiques of his reached 211 See A. C. F. Beales in JHS li (1931) 101-5. 2X2 A survey is now being made by Professor G-. L. Huxloy for the National Committee for Greek and Latin Studies. 213 See Personal recollections by Valentine Lord Cloncurry (Dublin, 1849) pp. 190-2. The Cloncurry papers, now in the National Library, Dublin, give details of the monies paid by him for the antiques and for freight, but no details of the pieces (Cloncurry MS 5660: I am grateful to Mr. David Large for this information, and that contained in the next note).</page><page sequence="58">70 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Ireland safely. Three of the four pillars of the portico of Lyons House are from Nero's Golden House at Rome.214 They are monoliths of polished red Egyptian granite. The fourth was manufactured from a 'much larger red column' (originally of grey granite) from the Baths of Titus, which Cloncurry had cut down to the size of the others.215 The most famous trophy of all was brought to the remote west of Ireland by Lord Sligo in 1812.216 During a visit to Greece Sligo had acquired the usual assortment of pottery and stone fragments. But at Mycenae he got a unique treasure?the main portions of the two ornamented pilasters from the entrance to the Treasury of Atreus. Moore in his life of Byron records : Lord Sligo having it on contemplation to expend some money in digging for antiquities, Lord Byron, in offering to act as his agent, and to see the money, at least, honestly applied, said?'You may trust me?I am no dilettante. Your connoisseurs are all thieves; but I care too little for these things even to steal them.217 The more conventional objects in Sligo's collection were preserved on view in or around Westport House, until they were sold by auction in England a few years ago.218 The pilasters from Mycenae were stored for many years in the basement, and forgotten until one of the Sligo family identified them in 1904. They were presented to the British Museum in 1905. The British Museum had previously (in 1863) received the collection of another Irishman, the sixth Viscount Strangford, British Ambassador in Con stantinople in 1820. It included a notable kouros-tjpe sculpture (the 'Strang ford Apollo') and three Cycladic figurines.219 Strangford was accompanied on his travels by his chaplain, Robert Walsh, who published a vivid and detailed account of his impressions of scenes and events in Greece and Turkey, 214 The ship, The Young Henry, was engaged in October/November 1805, at Civita Vecchia where it still was on 2 December. 'Land waiters fees on Statuary5 were paid on 12 April 1806 (Cloncurry MSS 5660 fol. 12). No further details have been discovered. Miss Emily Lawless of Lyons House was unable to add to the known facts. A search through Irish newspapers of the period by Mrs. Dorothy Stanford has revealed no reference to the wreck (which Cloncurry, loc. cit. in previous note, says was 'in Killiney Bay, within two hours' sail of Dublin'). Two efforts to organise diving operations in search of the cargo have not succeeded. 215 Cloncurry op. cit. p. 192 states that the three pillars from Nero's house had been used by Raphael to ornament the Famesine Palace. Baron von Humboldt had intended to buy them from the King of Naples for the King of Prussia, but had broken off negotiations when he heard that the fourth column was not part of the original set. 216 See A catalogue of sculpture in the department of Greek and Roman antiquities in the British Museum vol. i part 1 by F.

A damp climate helped by the ravages of Norsemen and other monastery-looters left little unscathed. Unfortunately too, when the monasteries in Ireland were dissolved under Henry VIII in the sixteenth century interest in classical studies was at a very low ebb. Ireland had no patron of neo-classicism like Duke Humphrey in England. The fact that there was no lasting university in Ireland until 1591 made the classical tradition particularly vulnerable. Nor were the earlier Anglo-Irish collectors of manuscripts, such as Sir James Ware328 and Archbishop James Ussher,229 interested in classical texts. At the same time the Irish-speaking majority naturally cherished the documents of their own civilisation more than those of pagan Greece and Rome. The foundation of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1591 established a centre where works of classical interest would be collected. As will be noted later, its library eventually acquired a good selection of early printed works.230 But no classical manuscripts of any great importance came to it. Its oldest are a fragment of Priscian from the second half of the tenth century (with characteristics of the Irish family of Priscian texts), an eleventh-century copy of part of Cicero's rhetorical writings, and a thirteenth-century copy of Seneca's letters. The earliest Greek manuscript is*a- copy of the first ten books of the Iliad with scholia, dating from the fourteenth century. From the fifteenth are: extracts from a commentary on the Iliad, a copy of the grammar of Theodore of Gaza (by John Serbopoulos of Constantinople who came to England before 1484, and copied many manuscripts there),231 a commentary on Thucydides by Michael Lygizus, a commentary on Dionysius Thrax, and a handsome copy of Aristotle's Categories. In contrast with the absence of notable classical manuscripts, papyrological material in Ireland is comparatively rich. The library of Trinity College, Dublin, contains several thousand fragments found by Flinders P?trie in the Fayyum district of Egypt, and also some fragments from Oxyrhynchus.

H. Sayce of Queen's College, Oxford, convinced P?trie that J. P. Mahaffy (who had made special studies of Ptolemaic Egypt) would be the best man to edit it. The Oxyrhynchus fragments were acquired by Trinity College as a subscriber to the Egyptian Exploration Fund. The fragments still in Trinity College contain portions of Plato's Laches and Protagoras, Xenophon's Cyropaedeia, Aristoxenos' work on rhythm and music, Theophrastus' Characters, Chariton's Chacreas and Gallirrhoe, and tragic and lyric fragments.233 Some literary fargments still remain unpublished, including a second-century fragment of twenty-five lines from the Iliad (19, 291-315) which has one minor reading not recorded in Allen's editio rrmior.2M The Chester Beatty Library in Dublin contains two notable collections of Greek papyri: first the Merton papyri (purchased by Dr. Chester Beatty) which include fragments of the Iliad, Odyssey, and Euripides' Phoenissae ;235 and secondly two lengthy papyri from Panopolis describing events and con ditions there in the reign of Diocletian.236 As already mentioned, the library of the Earl of Kildare in the late fifteenth century contained some books of classical interest. The next record of classical printed publications in Irish possession is the register of the library of Trinity College, Dublin, for 1601.237 It includes Aristotle (Vienna, 1560), his Organon (Frankfurt, 1585), Cicero (Lyons, 1585), Dioscorides (Basle, 1557), Euripides (Basle, 1562), Merula on Juvenal (Venice, 1578), Plato (Lyons, 1590), Ptolemy (Strasburg, 1513), Stephanus of Byzantium (prob.

In all there are over a hundred classical books of the fifteenth century in this library.238 After 1707 Irish scholars also had the use of the extensive collection of Archbishop Narcissus Marsh, when it became the nucleus of Ireland's first public library. It contains two fifteenth-century editions of Cicero and a good many sixteenth-century classics.239 Several of these volumes are autographed and annotated by Casaubon : these later became part of Stillingfleet's library which Marsh acquired in 1704. The library of the Jesuit Fathers at Milltown Park, Dublin, has eighteen Latin incunabula,240 and the diocesan library at Armagh, one.241 Besides the institutional libraries, private collections from the.eighteenth century onwards often contained extensive classical material. A good deal of evidence for this is available in sales-catalogues in the National Library of Ireland, the library of Trinity College, Dublin,242 and the British Museum. They have not yet been examined in detail for evidence of changing interests, tastes and fashions in classical studies. Greek and Latin in schools and universities As already described, there is evidence for the teaching?or at least the learning?of Greek as well as Latin in Ireland from the sixth century onwards. But almost nothing is known about methods and curricula until the sixteenth century, though it can be inferred that the works of the chief Latin grammarians, especially Priscian and Donatus, were studied and taught. The sixteenth century brought in the Jesuit colleges for Catholics and the grammar schools for Protestants, and in the end a university for the city of Dublin. In these foundations, Greek and Latin dominated all teaching in the humanities, as in other countries. The Jesuits were pioneers in advancing techniques for teaching Latin by the direct method, as exemplified in the 238 See T. K.

One eminent schoolmaster of the mid sixteenth century was Peter White,244 formerly a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, in Kilkenny. He taught two noted Latinists, Peter Lombard and Richard Stanihurst (who wrote a memorable description of his old teacher). The earliest record of classical authors owned by an Irish schoolboy dates from 1619.245 Conn O'Neill, second son of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, was brought for reasons of English policy to Eton College in 1615. His school bill for March 1619 includes charges for Cicero's Be officiis, Ovid's Metamor phoses, as well as Caninius' Greek Grammar, a Greek testament and a thesaurus 'phrasium poeticarum". Information about school curricula remains scanty246 until the Royal Com missions on Irish education began their surveys. Early in the nineteenth century some of the schools in the smaller country towns taught comprehensive classical curricula to judge from that of Ballymena Academy, Co. Antrim, in 1830.247 There the top class were to read the Iliad, three books of Xenoph?n's Cyro paideia, extracts from Lucian, Horace's Satires, Odes and Epistles, six books of Virgil, four satires of Juvenal, two plays of Terence, three books of Livy, and Sallust, besides ancient history, geography and mythology, and five books of the Greek New Testament. This exacting programme was perhaps prompted by the high classical standards of the recently founded Royal Belfast Academical Institution (1810). The schools already mentioned were mainly for the English-speaking population. The Irish-speaking rural schools,248 many of them run illicitly 243 T.

Kerry was par ticularly celebrated for its classical tradition. Sir Robert Peel speaking in the British House of Commons in 1826 described it as a region 'where the young peasants . . . run about in rags with a Cicero or a Virgil under their arms'. Some of the provincial local school-teachers published their own text books locally. For example Patrick Lynch of Co. Clare, who had learned his four foreign languages through the medium of Irish, produced at Carrick in 1796 the first volume of his Pentaglot preceptor: or elementary institute of the English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Irish languages. But either his public or his own spirit failed him, for he never published any more than the volume on English. Undoubtedly, Latin was widely taught249 and spoken in rural areas as already illustrated. Among the authors studied were Caesar, Horace, Livy, Ovid, Tacitus, Virgil and Terence. The amount of Greek known is less certain. At any rate, in some places there were erudite clergy and others who could teach it or discuss it, as George Borrow attests in his Lavengro.250 When the Irish National Schools were established in 1831 efforts were made to have classical studies included in the curriculum.251 These failed, and gradually a knowledge of Greek and Latin became confined mainly to the pupils at secondary schools and seminaries. It is clear from contemporary descriptions of secondary schools in the nine teenth century that methods of teaching the classics were sometimes dis couraging. The poet W. B. Yeats will be cited later as a witness against a Dublin school. A writer252 about a school in Kilkenny is no more favourable : 'We were set, daily, so many pages of Latin or Greek grammar to learn by heart, so many lines of a Latin or Greek author to translate?and parse, so as to be able to define all the names and adjectives and to conjugate all the verbs . . . The teacher saw that we were able to do all that ; teaching us nothing, but merely seeing that we learned . . .

Its curricula, which had been studied elsewhere253 Avent through the usual evolution in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In its earlier years the medieval trivium and quadrivium still dominated, and the emphasis was on Aristotle who was studied both in the original Greek and in Latin versions and commentaries. Undergraduates had to write a Latin essay every week. Candidates for bachelorship in arts had to make two de clamations, one in Latin, the other in Greek, in laudem philosophiae. Candidates for the mastership had to be able to prelect on any part of the first book of the Odyssey (a modest amount of poetry to have mastered at the end of a seven year course). But by 1736 a much more literary course was established, which included most of the now standard classical authors (but not Aeschylus, Euripides or Plato yet), besides others now rarely studied by undergraduates such as Musaeus, Epictetus, and the Tabula of Cebes. In 1759 some works of Plutarch, Xenophon and Euripides were added. To make room for them, Lucian, Musaeus, Theo critus, Epictetus and Cebes, Velleius Paterculus, Justin, Suetonius, the Odyssey, Aeneid 1-6 and Iliad 1-8 were omitted. Candidates for entrance to the university were now expected to have read these, as well as Nepos, Phaedrus, Caesar, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Sallust, Virgil, Cicero's Catiline orations, Terence, Horace and Juvenal; and in Greek, parts of Xenophon, Hesiod, Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, Musaeus, Lucian and 'the Golden Verses'. They were also expected to have received instruction in 'quantity', rhetoric, verse and prose composition, history, and mythology. The little evidence that there is suggests that academic standards were reasonably good. Lord Chesterfield, who was Viceroy 1745-46, stated in 1751 that ?the Irish schools and universities (sic) are undisputably better than ours'. Goldsmith in his Life of Parnell says that the entrance examination to Trinity College was harder than that of Oxford or Cambridge in his time. On the other hand, Theophilus Swift in his Animadversions on the Fellows of Trinity College (1794) alleges that the barbara celarent (the crude mnemonic for remembering the moods of the logical propositions) had for the Fellows of Trinity College *both more music and more meaning than the hymns of Callimachus or the luminous and instructive pages of Thucydides'. But the fact that his son had first failed in the Dublin college and then had succeeded in graduating at Oxford? another piece of evidence perhaps, for differences in standards?may have influenced his opinion. On the other hand, Newman when ho surveyed the classical scene in Ireland in 1854, as already quoted, found it deficiont in literary scholarship. 253 See J. M. Stubbs, History of the University of Dublin from 1501 to 1800 (Dublin, 1889) passim, Clarke, Classical education etc. chap. xiii. and W. B.

Under pressures of this kind Greek ceased to be a compulsory subject for matriculation in Irish universities early in the century, and Latin is no longer a universal requirement. Even the theological seminaries and faculties have now abandoned or greatly reduced their requirements in Greek and Latin. Consequently the number of Irish schools teaching these languages has greatly decreased,255 On the other hand, general interest in classical trans lations, art, mythology and history, and in Greece as a country to study and visit, has noticeably increased. Classical influences on Anglo-Irish literature Though for over two centuries the Greek and Roman classical writers were the chief formative influence on English-speaking authors in Ireland, no general study of their effect has yet been published.256 The main critical question is whether the Anglo-Irish literature resulting from the interplay of classical and local elements differed significantly from neo-classical and Augustan literature in other countries, as the Irish varieties of Palladian architecture differ at times from their British or Italian analogues. It goes without saying that Anglo-Irish authors (by which the present writer means authors of Irish origins who wrote in English), since most of them in the seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries had been educated under the classical regimen of Trinity College, Dublin, modelled their style and sometimes selected their materials in imitation of classical exemplars, satirists like Swift257 recalling Juvenal, Martial and Lucian, orators like Burke,258 Grattan and Mood, emulating Demosthenes and Cicero, philosophers like Berkeley writing in Platonic dia logue-form (which Oscar Wilde also used at times), ethical writers like Gold smith in his Traveller and Deserted village and Moore in his poetic epistles, following Horace. What the classics mainly provided for these eighteenth century writers was patterns of style, not content. Berkeley's immaterialism 254 For a survey of classical education in Ireland in 1921 (with a preliminary historical synopsis) see Report of the committee appointed . . .to inquire into the position of classics in the educational system of the United Kingdom, (London, 1921; published separately under the title The classics in education. 255 ~Fot information on pupils taking Greek up to 1949 see Denis Meehan, 'A future for Greek', Irish Ecclesiastical Record lxxi (1949) 1-14, and some more recent statistics in The Irish Times, 3 Oct. 1955, 5. A survey of the present situation is being prepared by Professors M. J. Boyd and W. Meany for the Irish National Committee for Greek and Latin Studies. 256 Some general remarks on a few of the leading Anglo-Irish authors will be found in Thomson's Classical influences etc. 257 For Swift's many classical books see Harold Williams, Dean Swift's library (Cambridge, 1932). 258 R. H. Murray, Edmund Burke (Oxford, 1931) has a good deal to say on Burke's classical interests. For classical influences on his political theory see E. Barker, The Politics of Aristotle (Oxford, 1948) lxi-lxii, and for his developments of'Longinus' in his Philosophical enquiry see T. R. Henn, Longinus and English criticism (Cambridge, 1934) chap. x.</page><page sequence="67">Stanford?Towards a history of classical influences in Ireland 79 was in many ways highly anti-classical; Swift's Gulliver's travels imposed the outlook of the new scientific age on the kind of fancies that Lucian described; Burke's Ciceronian periods (but he was also a master of the Senecan aphoristic style) embodied contemporary events. But the ultimate principles of their thought were generally classical. Burke took his constitutionalism to some extent from Aristotle, and his Treatise on the sublime was a development from 'Longinus' ; and his letters contain many classical quotations and reminiscences. Though Burke was more widely read in the Latin authors than in the Greek, in essentials he was more influenced by Greek ideals than Roman, especially in his admiration for beauty and his devotion to political and religious freedom. His impeachment of Warren Hastings was mainly modelled on the Yerrine orations, but his tone in them is often more Demosthenic than Ciceronian. But when he made a classical joke it was generally in Latin, as in the incident recorded by Boswell when Burke described Wilke carried on the shoulders of a mob (in Horace's phrase for Pindar) as numerisque fertur lege solutis. Augustan classicism yielded in Ireland a little later than elsewhere in western Europe to romantic Hellenism?in the second half of the nineteenth century. Its outstanding Irish embodiment was Oscar Wilde,259 a pupil of Mahafiy's for three years at Trinity College, Dublin (where Tyrrell's fine literary taste also influenced him), before he went to Oxford. His achievements as a classical student at both universities were high, and he could have won a classical fellowship in either university if he had put his mind to it. Many of his poems are nostalgically and hauntingly Hellenic, his Theocritus, Garden of Eros, The new Helen, The Burden of Itys and Gharmides&gt; to mention only a few. Wilde, too was an outstanding example of a type of classical influence rarer among Irishmen than elsewhere. England had its 'Plutarch's men' in the sixteenth century, and other countries had citizens whose life was a reflection of some classical exemplar. But the Irish on the whole were not imitators in that way. Wilde, however, was clearly influenced by the homo sexuality of the ancient Greeks, as can be seen in his classical poems ; and his aestheticism, learned mainly from William Pater at Oxford, was a kind of hyper Hellenism. No doubt Wilde over-dramatised the conflict between paganism and Christianity in his soul, as in his sonnet beginning Ah God ! Ah God ! those dear Hellenic hours Had drowned the memory of Thy bitter pain. But rarely since the fifth century has the conflict between Athens and Jerusalem been so fully exhibited as in his life and work. Wilde's younger contemporary W. B. Yeats made his name first as a Celtic romanticist. But in later life he turned to classical themes and theories,260 259 On Wilde's classicism I have found the following most informative: B. Fehr, 'Studien zu Oscar Wilde's Gedichten', (Berlin, 1918) E. Bundy, The influence of Pater and Matthew Arnold in the prose-writings of Oscar Wilde (Gothenberg, 1914). Mahaffy's in fluence on Wilde is discussed in the work cited in n. 166 above. Wilde published versions of passages from Aeschylus, Euripides and Aristophanes. 260 On Yeats's classicism see especially F. A. C. Wilson, W. B. Yeats and tradition (London, 1958); R. Ellmann, The identity of Yeats (London, 1954) and Yeats, the man and the masks (London, 1949).</page><page sequence="68">80 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and when he came to write his autobiographical essays in his late forties he expressed deep regret at his neglect of the classics in the High School, Dublin (where perhaps he heard the young Bury talk of Byzantium).261 He partly blamed the method of teaching (not unknown even now in Ireland) : ... in place of a dozen lines of Virgil with a dictionary, I was expected to learn with the help of a crib a hundred and fifty lines. The other boys were able to learn the translation off, and to remember what words of Latin and English corresponded with one another, but I, who, it may be, had tried to find out what happened in the parts we had not read, made ridicu lous mistakes.262 Yeats adds a poignant cri de coeur. Speaking of his father he says he should have taken me away from school. He would have taught me nothing but Greek and Latin, and I would now be a properly educated man, and would not have to look in useless longing at books that have been, through the poor mechanism of translation, the builders of my soul, nor face authority with the timidity born of excuse and evasion.263 'The builders of my soul' must have been surprising words to those who saw Yeats as a romanticist or a nationalist or a modernist. Yeats struggled hard with neo-Platonism, knew Homer from translations, admired North's Plutarch, and was well acquainted with the classical antiquities in the British Museum. He made bad mistakes at times?for which scholastic Dublin mocked him unmercifully?owing to his lack of basic training. But out of his Autolycan ragbag of information he produced magnificent poems on Helen, Leda, and the Delphic oracle, and his translations of Sophocles' Oedipus dramas (made from other translations) contain some of the noblest renderings ever made of those plays. Much has already been written on Yeats's classical interests, but a full study of them has yet to be published. In one respect at least his attitude was typical of the Irish classical tradition. Writing about the education of his son in 1930, he wrote: My son is now between nine and ten and should begin Greek at once and be taught by the Berlitz method that he may read as soon as possible that most exciting of all stories, the Odessey [sic] from that landing in Ithica [sic] to the end . . . Do not teach him one word of Latin. The Roman people were the classic decadence, their literature form without matter. They destroyed Milton, the French seventeenth century and our own eighteenth century, and our schoolmasters even to-day read Greek with Latin eyes. Greece, could we but approach it with eyes as young as its own, might renew our youth ... If he wants to read Irish after he is well founded in Greek, let him?it will clear his eyes of the Latin miasma.264 26i See Ellmann, Identity of Yeats 149. 262 Autobiographies, i 56-7. 263 Autobiographies i 58-9, cf. On the Boiler 12. There are over thirty references to,, and discussions of, classical matters in Autobiographies, besides several in his Essays and introductions and letters.

Between Yeats and the other most famous Anglo-Irish writer of his time, Joyce (unless one ranks Bernard Shaw, only a tangential classicist, with them), moved a gifted intermediary, a close friend of both: Oliver St. John Gogarty. As an undergraduate in Trinity College, Dublin, he had been an ardent acolyte of Mahaffy and Tyrrell, and had acquired a lively, if superficial, repertoire of classical ideas and anecdotes from them. He wrote some finely chiselled epigrams on classical themes, and perhaps he helped to stimulate Yeats's inclination towards Greek things. Some of his obiter dicta are worth preserving, as: This modern admiration for the cold and classic only exists because it is modern and the 'classics' are old. Landor is 'Greek' and 'classic' but he is more classic than Aeschylus and Euripides. Surely every word in Aeschylus must have been as full of mystery and romance as 'alien corn5 or 'ancestral voices'?romance native to the Greeks? Forgetting this, or being out of touch with it we call the white marble classic. It was coloured once.265 His life-long odi-et-amo friend, Joyce, always felt inferior to him in one respect, his knowledge of Greek. On Joyce's desk when he died in Zurich in 1940 were Gogarty's latest book and a Greek-English lexicon, presumably to elucidate Gogarty's Greek allusions. There is no need here to elaborate on Joyce's classicism. It has been fully discussed elsewhere.266 The classical authors deeply affected his mind, his spirit and his stylistic form. Aristotle and Aquinas moulded his adolescent mind. Plato he distrusted. In his early years he found Homer uninteresting and described Hellenism as 'European appendicitis', though Sophocles pleased him. Afterwards his interest in Homer grew, as Ulysses was beginning to take shape in his mind. (He had been first introduced to that hero in an Irish scholar's edition of Lamb's Adventures of Ulysses.) He now began to read widely in Odyssean scholarship, welcoming, for example, B?rard's theory of the Semitic origins of the Odyssey, which suited his portrait of the modern Ulysses as a Jew. He never became a fluent reader of ancient Greek, but claimed some competence in the modern language, writing in 1922 I spoke or used to speak modern Greek not too badly . . . and have spent a great deal of time with Greeks of all kinds from noblemen down to onion sellers, chiefly the latter.268 Like his ancient Irish predecessors in the free rendering of Greek lore, he gained one advantage from his lack of systematic knowledge: it gave him wider free dom in his etymological speculations and paronomasias. 265 Quoted by XJlick O'Connor in Oliver St. John Gogarty (London, 1964) 99. See also 26 ff for Gogarty's association with Tyrrell and Mahaffy. 266 Especially by S. L. Goldberg, The classical temper (London, 1961). See also R.

Secondly, in Ulysses the pattern of Homer's Odyssey imposed a controlling design on what might have been an amorphous account of a single day's multifarious activities in a modern metro polis. Without that discipline Ulysses might have relaxed into the verbosity of Gogarty's or O'Casey's later memoirs. Besides, the intellectual challenge of finding authentic modern analogues for themes in the Odyssey stimulated Joyce's imagination powerfully. The result of this interaction and tension between the world of Homer and the world of an Edwardian Dublinman, shocking as it seemed on first appearance with its apparent travesty of classical values, now stands as one of the most impressive products of classical influence in the whole history of the modern classical tradition, ranking in its sustained artistic integrity with Shakespeare's Greek and Roman plays, Calderon's Circe dramas, and Kazantzakis' Odysseia.2 Classical influences are also clear in Irish drama.270 Drama was late in developing as a literary genre in Ireland. Some indirect evidence survives for sporadic drama in the fifteenth century, but there is no information about its content. The earliest specific reference is to a performance of The nine worthies of Christendom by mummers in 1541. This would include three classical figures, Hector, Alexander and Julius Caesar. But they were probably silent. A man of some classical learning, John Ogilby, a Scot whose translations of Homer and Virgil won some repute, was, as Master of the Revels in Dublin, the builder and controller of the first theatre in Ireland in 1637. But there is no evidence of his having produced any play on a classical theme. Henry Burnell's Landgartha (1639), though based on a Scandinavian theme from Saxo Grammaticus, indulged classical taste by presenting an Amazon in the prologue and a masque portraying the killing of Hector by Achilles with the help of Athena, after which 'Nymphs of Mount Ida sing a song in foure or five parts, to a pleasing tune5. Richard Flecknoe's masque The marriage of Oceanus and Brittania (1659) no doubt had some conventional classical trappings: no copy survives. He showed acquaintanceship with the doctrines of Aristotle and 'Longinus' in his Discourse of the English Stage. 269 Of. W. B. Stanford, The Ulysses theme (2nd edn., Oxford, 1963) chap. xv. 270 For most of the information in this section I am indebted to Peter Kavanagh,. The Irish Theatre (Tralee, 1946). To his lists may be added Hecuba (1726) attributed to Richard West, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, produced at Drury Lane: (cf. Mahaffy, History of classical Greek literature i, 2, 121-2). I have also consulted W. S. Clarke, The early Irish stage (Oxford, 1955). For classical influences on Sir John Denham's play The Sophy see Kavanagh 32.

His Nicomedes followed in 1671. By that time Irish authors were beginning to contribute their share of classical or quasi-classical plays to the British and Irish theatres. Such were Tryphon by Lord Broghill (Roger Boyle, later Lord Orrery, a man of some classical erudition) in 1669 and Herod the Great by the same author in 1694; Beauties triumph (1676) a masque on the judgement of Paris by Thomas Duffett ; The ingratitude of a common-wealth or the fall of Caius Martius Coriolanus (1682) and the libretto for Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (in 1689), also Brutus of Alba (1678) on the mythical Prince Brutus of Troy ancestor of the Britons according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, by Nahum T?te, poet laureate ; The fate of Capua (1700), and The Spartan Dame (1719), taken from Plutarch's life of Agis, by Thomas Southerne. Besides these professional productions, performances of classical plays or plays in Latin had been used as a means of fostering classical studies. At the Jesuits' schools a Latin play, generally written by the teacher of humanities or rhetoric, normally accompanied the distribution of prizes. Early in the eighteenth century Thomas Sheridan, the schoolmaster whose translations have already been noticed, used to have a Greek play performed by his senior class from time to time and won more than a local reputation for it.2700 No Irish classical play of the eighteenth century won an enduring reputation. Perhaps the most effective is Arthur Murphy's Grecian daughter (1773), based on Valerius Maximus' story of the filial piety of Euphrasia towards her father Evander when imprisoned by Dionysius of Syracuse. Murphy also tried, with little success, to use the chief events of Euripides' Iphigeneia in Tauris in his next tragedy, Ahuma. Among subsequent titles of plays and operas written by Irishmen were: Pyrrhus and Demetrius, Themistocles, Regulus, Anthony and Cleopatra, Daphne and Amintor, Orpheus and Eurydice, Pyramus and Thisbe, Phryne, Gaius Gracchus, The fall of Carthage (in Greek style with a chorus, by J. J. Proby), Polyxena, and Virginius. John O'Keefe (1747-1833) showed talent in bur lesquing classical scenes, and in his Agreeable surprise (1792) he makes his chief character a butler called Lingo who is a pedant-ignoramus of the typo already mentioned in this essay. He is described in these terms : It seems he's been a schoolmaster horo in the country, taught all the bumkin fry what he calls Latin; and the damn'd dog so patches his own bad English with his bits of bad Latin and jumbles tho Gods, Goddesses, Heroes celestial and infernal together .... An example of his discourse is : Scholar! I was master of scholars. Scio scribendo, I can read. Legere, I can write. Tacitorum Latinum, I can speak Latin. But then quid opus mihi usumque sciente ? What need have I of so much knowledge % In more recent times G. B. Shaw has, of course, used classical themes in his Caesar and Cleopatra, and Androcles and the lion, but their thought and 270a For the Jesuits' Latin plays see Kavanagh op. cit. in previous n., pp. 49-55.

The late Earl of Longford produced his own translations of plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, in the Gate Theatre, Dublin. Yeats's Sophoclean translations have already been noticed. Besides these works for theatrical performance, many classical dramatic poems were composed by Irishmen in the nineteenth century, among them, Ahestis (1879), Helena in Troas (1886) and A Sicilian idyll (1890) by John, Todhunter, and Ariadne (1872) by Edwin Hamilton. Two other examples of Irish Hellenism showed more originality than those rather conventional works. George Darley's Nepenthe'2''11 (1839), a rhapsodic poem in the style of Shelley, described an ecstatic journey in company with bacchanals and nymphs through classical and other lands. Woman, or Ida of Athens (1809) a novel in four small volumes by Sydney Owenson272 (afterwards Lady Morgan) is no masterpiece. But its local colour, drawn entirely from books on ancient and modern Greece, is vivid and one does get some feeling of Greece under the Turks in the early nineteenth century. Apart from the romantic element, two matters of principle are strongly expressed. The first is a belief in woman's gifts and rights (she mentions Aspasia's accomplish ments), and the second, a faith in the ability of the Greek people to win their independence. Byron mocked the books, perhaps for personal reasons, in his Ghilde Harold's Pilgrimage, but in fact Miss Owenson anticipated his romantic philhellenism .273 Classical influences on Irish patriotism This encouragement of nationalistic resurgence in Lady Morgan's Woman? or Ida of Athens was prompted by the urgings of Sir William Gell, the classical archaeologist and traveller, who helped her with topographical material.274 It marks another noteworthy aspect of Irish interest in Greece. As described on earlier pages here, many Irishmen played leading parts in the Greek war of independence, and took an interest in the fortunes of the new kingdom of Greece. At the same time the course of Ireland's own struggle for freedom was influenced by classical Greek and Roman history. In fact until the Celtic revival in the mid-nineteenth century, Irish patriots, from the time of Swift onwards, naturally took much of their doctrines and examples from liberators among the ancient Greeks and Romans?naturally since the main staple of their education at school and in the university was classical history and litera ture. Wolfe Tone275 and Thomas Davis found the Greek tradition more 271 Professor Brendan Kennelly kindly drew my attention to this poem. Cf. A.

The College Historical Society in Dublin gave young patriots a theatre for their enthusiasm. In it Robert Emmet in speaking on the perennial theme of freedom of speech 'proceeded to portray the evil effects of the despotism and tyranny of the governments of antiquity, and most eloquently those of Greece and Rome.'276 In it, too, Thomas Davis, in his cele brated address in 1840 both criticised and praised the classical influence. On the one hand he found the classical curricula in the College far too narrow: for even if by chance the young student has got some ideas of the picturesque, the generous, the true, into his head, he is neither encouraged nor expected to apply them to his classic studies. Classics! good sooth, he had better read with the hedge-school boys the History of Rogues, Tories and Rappa rees, or Moll Flanders, than study Homer and Horace in Trinity College. But further on in his address Davis affirms the value of Greek and Roman history and literature as sources of inspiration and guidance in modern times, and as being directly relevant to the political problems of the Irish nation. At a later time he distilled this doctrine into the opening lines of one of Ireland's most celebrated patriotic poems, A nation once again: When boyhood's fire was in my blood I read of ancient freemen, For Greece and Rome who bravely stood Three hundred men and three men . . . Earlier in the century Richard Lovell Edgeworth had written to a govern ment committee on education in Ireland saying that some abridgements of ancient history for school use, which he had seen, were 'certainly improper' since 'to inculcate democracy and a foolish hankering after undefined liberty is not necessary in Ireland.'277 But if the ancient histories had been suppressed, there would still have been patriotic street ballads to remind the Irish people of the Greek and Roman lovers of freedom.278 Perhaps the most dramatic appeal to classical precedent in the history of modern Irish patriotism was John Mitchel's famous climax at his trial in 1848 : The Roman who saw his hand burning to ashes before the tyrant, promised that three hundred should follow out his enterprise. Can I not promise for one, for two, for three, aye for hundreds?279 At which cries came from round the court-room 'Promise for me, Mitchell' Similarly Thomas F. Burke at his trial for high treason in 1866 drew strength from the Spartan mother's dictum to her son, 'Return with your shield or on it' ; and Archbishop Healy of Tuam in 1904 speaking to the memory of the Ulster Earls affirmed that their deaths were as far from being in vain as those 276 R.

These allusions sound banal in cold blood, but in their contexts they are charged with deep emotion. Much more could be written on this Graeco-Roman factor in the Irish struggle for independence. It is a factor which became almost entirely ob scured by the more dynamic and more distinctive quality of the Gaelic tra dition with its valhalla of entirely Irish heroes. One can see the contrast clearly in the writings of Patrick Pearse, where Cuchulain and Finn have sup planted Le?nidas and Publius Horatius. But the two traditions were never hostile or mutually exclusive, as the doctrine of Davis showed. In fact it might be true to say that the outstandingly balanced nature of Davis's nationalistic creed, which Pearse inherited, resulted from the harmony of classical and Gaelic ideals in his mind, just as James Joyce's literary masterpiece Ulysses resulted from a fusion of Greek and Irish elements. It was characteristic of Pearse's insight and sympathy that when he came to pay his final tribute to Davis in 1916 he chose classical imagery to describe him : Character is the greatest thing in a man: and Davis's character was such as the Apollo Belvedere is said to be in the physical order?in his presence all men stood more erect. The Romans had a noble word which summed up all moral beauty and civic valour : the word virtus. If English had as noble a word as that it would be the word to apply to the thing which made Thomas Davis so great a man.280 Conclusion Looking back over the fourteen centuries which have been so superficially and cursorily surveyed in this study,281 one may identify some distinctive features in the Irish classical tradition. First, from the earliest times there is a high degree of independence in employing classical themes, as can be seen as clearly in the early medieval version of the Odyssey, as in Joyce's Ulysses. In such writings the classical models are used to provide a springboard for the 280 Patrick Pearse, The spiritual nation (13 February, 1916). 281 It has not been feasible here to offer any useful discussion of the strong classical influences on Irish architecture and art. No specialised study of this aspect of Ireland has yet been published. References to classicism in Irish architecture will be found in the Records of the Georgian Society (5 vols. 1909-13) passim; T. U. Sadleir and P. L. Dickin son, Georgian mansions in Ireland (Dublin, 1915): Arthur C. Champneys, Irish ecclesiastical architecture (London, 1910) 30 and 63 if. ; A. E. Richardson, Monumental classical architecture in Great Britain and Ireland in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (London, 1914) 46-7, 59,88 (J". S. Mulvaney's railway stations being notable examples of neo-classicism), Maurice Craig, Dublin 1660-1860 (London, 1952) and in the Life of the late William Vitruvius Morrison by John Morrison (copy in the National Library, Dublin, without date or place of publication: Dr. Maurice Craig kindly referred me to this). On classical elements in stucco-work see C. P. Curran, Dublin decorative plasterers of the seventeenth and eighteenth century (London, 1967). For painting: R. R. Wark in Journal of the Warburg Institute xvii (1954) 382-4 describes the influence of Burke's classicism on the Irish painter James Barry; Thomas Bodkin, Proceedings of the Classical Association of Ireland 1919-20, 33-40, discusses Adam Buck's drawings of Greek vases (designed as a continuation of Sir William Hamilton's works) published in 1811. Four of them are used by Beazley in his Attic red figure vase-painters. ^For the influence of classical Greek coins on the Irish coinage see Coinage of Saorst?t ?ireann, 1928, with an introductory article by W.

Secondly, the Irish tradition has been more consistently philhellenic than that of the other classical traditions of western Europe. Thirdly, Irish writers made a remarkably rich use of Greek and Latin for the purpose of displaying linguistic virtuosity. This often goes with verbal obscurity, as in the 'Hisperic' Hiberno Latin and the kind of pseudo-pedantry described by observers of rural scholars. We have seen its effects too, in Stanihurst's Aeneid and elsewhere. Fourthly, in matters of scholarship the Irish have often shown an audacity, which others might call foolhardiness, in attempting tasks seemingly beyond their powers. Eriugena's translations from the Greek, Mahaffy's incursion into the field of papyrology, Stephen MacKenna's translation of Plotinus, exemplify this characteristic. In each case the results were open to criticism, and they received it. But judged in their entirety these and other examples of Irish academic boldness have often been justified in the judgement of later eras. Two mental qualities seem to have been the main sources of these character istics: first, a native boldness in attack, and secondly, a conviction that the native Irish literary tradition stood on equal terms with those of Greece and Home, both in artistry and in content. The Irish writers believed that Achilles and Cuchulain, Ulysses and Mael Duin, Priam and Conchobar, Alexander and Niall of the Nine Hostages, Proteus and Manann?n Mac Lir, Caesar and Brian Boru, were people of similar rank and virtue. In other words, the Irish refused to accept barbarian status despite the immense prestige of the classical ethos. Like their kinsmen the continental Celts, as already described, they received the Greeks as guests, not primarily as instructors. Finally, as said at the outset, the main purpose of this synopsis?perhaps readers may see it as yet another example of rashness?has been to stimulate further work in a neglected field. While other nations have their full histories of the Graeco-Roman element in their traditions, Ireland has not, mainly perhaps because the ideological struggle between the Gaelic and the English elements has monopolised attention for soveral centuries. Yot Latin was the second language of the majority of the Irish people for a much longer period than English, and the history and mythology of anciont Greece and Rome were familiar in Ireland long before the introduction of English history and mythology. In fact Irish civilisation in its full perspective should bo regarded as trilingual, not bilingual, and tripartite, not bipartite.</page><page sequence="76">88 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Acknowledgements My thanks are due to many scholars for help: in the sections on Irish literature especially to M?ir?n O Daly, James Carney, David Greene and E.
