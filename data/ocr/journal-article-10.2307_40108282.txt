Readers rarely come as close as they do here, or as soon after the fact, to Latin American foreign policy making. This study is one of few scholarly works by Latin Americans on international relations theory, and even fewer by policy-makers close to government decision-making. In the early 1990s, during the first presi- dency of Carlos Menem, Carlos Escude was an adviser to the foreign minister of Argentina, Guido Di Telia, on questions of foreign policy strategy. In that role, he advocated and helped chart a dramatic foreign policy shift towards strong align- ment with the United States. Escude argues here that the shift represented peripheral state realism, where a vulnerable nation followed a course that would benefit the majority of its citizens and that lacked an 'obsession with state power or security' - this in contrast to a long history of Argentine foreign policy that neglected the interests of the majority. In conjunction with Menem's policy sea change, Escude proposes a normative theory of international relations that is 'citizen-centric', arguing that his model - though inspired by Menem-era foreign policy - is not necessarily bound to market liberalism. The principal strength of the book is Escude's broad-based critique of the theory components of international relations, from the perspective of a foreign ministry insider. He disarms incisively questionable assumptions built around theoretical linguistic mechanisms and highlights the inadequacies of structural realism - as well as its failed applications to Argentine foreign policy since 1989. A chapter on anthropomorphic fallacies in international relations discourse features a stinging indictment of language that finds states 'weak', 'strong', or otherwise defined in their foreign policies by human characteristics or emotions. Inadequate as a means of analysing European and United States policy-making, 'anthropo- morphizations' are all the more incongruous for poorer nations like Argentina. Moreover, Escude points out that at the time of the Falklands/Malvinas War and at other times in Argentina before 1989, governments have used anthropomorphisms to mobilize the majority behind counterproductive and dangerous policy ventures. Despite the strength of the theoretical critique, the study is mis titled. There is little here on foreign policy theory in Argentina, and its applications in the foreign ministry. In addition, not only do we learn too little about the bases for Argentine decision-making after 1989, Escude glosses over important points of strategy too quickly, including the disarmament of the Condor II missile programme and the xx. 2: June 1998</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 493 decision to send warships in support of the United States-led effort in the Gulf War. Ultimately, the volume raises as many problems as it resolves. In charting a history of Argentine antagonisms towards the United States before 1989, Escude cites geographical isolation and a nationalist education system, but neglects any mention of a strong current in the historical literature that finds these antagonisms a Washington invention. Moreover, an assessment that Argentina asserted its independence in alignment with the United States is questionable; the author rejects critics of Menem's foreign policy by stating that the pro-American stance was ca calculated acquiescence to the political needs of the United States' that would benefit a majority of Argentines by generating international financial and business confidence in the nation. He also overstates the significance of Menem's break with the past. In his breast-beating over Cuba, for example, surely Menem has been as guilty as his predecessors of so-called anthropomorphic fallacies in foreign policy. Finally, in explaining the foreign policy shift in practical and theor- etical terms, Escude ignores the international context; by staking out a neo-liberal position close to that of Washington, Argentine leaders undertook roughly the same kind of policy shift that took place in almost every Latin American country at roughly the same time. As much as anything, Argentina's foreign policy trans- formation came about for the same underlying reason that similar policies came into effect throughout the Americas: for want of other viable options in the after- math of the cold war and the promise of prosperity through globalization. While more of Escude's insights into the running of Di Telia's foreign ministry would have been welcome, Escude has provided an important theoretical critique of international relations theory. He has provided scholars with the first theoretical underpinnings for policy-making by a peripheral state in the neo-liberal era, which include general abstention from interstate power politics, idealistic foreign policies, and risky confrontations with great powers.
