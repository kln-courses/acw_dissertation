<plain_text><page sequence="1">GARY MICHAEL TARTAKOV and VIDYA DEHEJIA SHARING, INTRUSION, AND INFLUENCE: THE MAHISASURAMARDINT IMAGERY OF THE CALUKYAS AND THE PALLAVAS Two Closely Related Images At the top of a pillar in the hall of the Mallikdrjuna temple at Pattadakal is a fascinating small relief representation of the Goddess Durgd in combat with Mahisdsura, the Buffalo Demon (Fig. i).1 The treatment of the theme seems quite unlike any known on other Early Calukya monuments. Instead of the usual iconic slaughter of Mahisdsura it shows a battle between opposed hosts, immediately suggesting the inspiration, and even the model, of the well-known Pallava representation of this theme filling the northern wall of the MahisdsuramardinI Mandapa at Mahabalipuram (Fig. z). The logic of this suggestion follows a well established pattern in the art historical analysis of India's visual imagery, by which we trace the influence of one artistic work or tradition in subsequent works significantly resembling them. Sivaramamurti set the pattern for this particular design, in discussing its other widely known variation, at Ellora (Fig. 7), some thirty years ago. A Great Theme has an Appeal One of the most remarkable carvings at Mahdbalipuram is the fight of Mahish- dsuramardinI with the demon wearing a buffalo's head. While everywhere in North India and even in the Deccan, Mahishamardin! is shown trampling a buffalo, from whose cut neck issues a demon in fighting attitude, and while as Durgd Mahishamar- dinI she is shown calm standing on the cut head of a buffalo in the Tamil country, it is at Mahdbalipuram that a great Pallava sculptor has created a great form of Devi seated unruffled on her lion playfully fighting the tremendous monster in front of her... To emphasize the great exploit, Devi is shown normal in size, her opponent colossal and with dignified royal bearing, an umbrella raised over his head, but still she fights with ease from her lion, while in other representations the figure of Devi dwarfs the opponent represented as buffalo under her feet in killing whom great effort is evident. The appeal that this panel always has had is clear from the fact that the sculptor of the great Rashtraku.ta king Krishna has paid a tribute as it were to this panel, by almost adopting it in his own version of the theme in that magnificent temple at Ellora which is a wonder of temple architecture. 2 1 The temple was originally called the TrailakyEsvara. 2 C. Sivaramamurti, Royal Conquests and Cultural Migrations in South India and the Deccan (Calcutta, 195 5), P.-3. Emphasis added. 287</page><page sequence="2">In his detailed classification of MahisdsuramardinI types M. Seshadri supports Siv- aramamurti's view and adds to it. He calls this an example of the "Anthropomorphic Type" of Buffalo Demon,3 the third of the four types he recognizes. Agreeing with the suggestion that the Mahabalipuram image is the source for the Ellora imagery, Seshadri adds that, "It is very possible that this form ... originated with the Pallavas and became popular in the whole of South India".4 In bringing a Calukya version of the imagery to attention we can be seen as adding an intermediate, Calukya, step to the transfer of the motif from the Pallavas of South India to the Rastrakfitas of the northern Deccan. This logic fits into the broader and well established notion that Calukya's Southern (Drdvida) style is derived from an essentially more-Southern, archetypal Dravidian style, found in the tradition of the Pallavas. "More- Southern" in this case is taken to indicate both the geographical location of the Pallavas, to the south of the Calukyas, and the assumption that the Pallavas, with their older surviving Dravidian (Tamil) literature had the aboriginal, precedent-setting role in creat- ing and maintaining the Drdvida artistic traditions shared by both the Kannada and Tamil regions. The Pallava artists, or their artistic tradition, are thus seen as influencing the Calukya artists or tradition, several generations before their influence was felt on the even more northerly Rastraku.tas. The seminal version of this hypothesis occurs in Alexander Rea's Pallava Architecture,s where it is not Tamil esthetic conceptions but artists that are supposed to have traveled, the style being considered the property of the dynasty and a supposed race it headed. The way Rea stated the situation historically was to propose that, "Previous to the arrival of the Chdlukyans - who first established themselves in the Peninsula about the fifth century A. D. - the Pallavas were the dominant race in the Southern Dekkan".6 Art historically he proposed that the Calukyas had a style of their own and that the "southern features" and the Calukya temples themselves in a style similar to that found among the Pallavas, were done by imported Pallava artisans. He explained the "southern features" of the Kaildsa at Ellora the same way.7 Though references to race have since been dropped, most subsequent accounts continue to assume that the Southern style has traveled outward from Tamilnad through the emigration of Tamil artists. The hypothesis deriving the Early Calukya's Drdvida architecture from the Pallava's Drdvida has been repeatedly stated. The usual demonstration of this is based on the comparison of the best known temples of each tradition, the Pallava's Kailisanitha temple at Kanci and the Calukya's Virupaksa at Pattadakal.8 The formal similarities between the 3 M.

XXII, No. z (1963), reprint p. 19-zi. 4 Seshadri (1963), P. 19. 5 Alexander Rea, Pallava Architecture; Archaelogical Survey of India, New Imperial Series, vol. XXXlV (Madras, i909). Illustrated exclusively by woodcuts and with extensive references to excavations and research of the early eighties, the latest work cited here is from 1885 and there can be little doubt that the work was written then. 6 Rea, p. 7. 7 Rea, p.14. 8 The initial and best known discussion is in Henry Cousens, Chdlukyan Architecture of the Kanarese Districts, A.S.I., N.I.S., vol. XLII (Calcutta, i926), pp. 61-6z. 288</page><page sequence="3">two are significant, and there exists inscriptional evidence to show not only that the Kaildsandtha is the older, but that the patron of the temple at Pattadakal, the Calukya emperor Vikramdditya II, both knew and admired the Kaildsandtha.9 Comparable formal similarities link this pair to the later Kaildsa at Ellora. And once again the historical evidence of the Rastrakuta's conquest of the Calukyas, in the generation between the creation of the Virfpaksa and the Kaildsa, link the structures politically. The Rastrakf.ta's Kaildsa, which contains the sculpture described by Sivaramamurti, is the northern-most example of a major temple in the Drdvida style. Since the Mallikdrjuna temple, housing our Calukya version of the theme, is the twin of the Virfpaksa, we now seem to have a striking sculptural parallel to the long supposed sequence of architectural influences. Our main intent in what follows is to test and refine this logic of stylistic origination and artistic sharing, by a more precise and thorough examination of the region's surviving imagery, and a more sensitive interpretation of the various sorts of cultural sharing possible. The eloquent Pallava relief at Mahabalipuram is close to four meters long and two-and- a-half high. It depicts the battle between Durga and Mahisdsura, with each of the principals shown surrounded by a host of supporters. On one side the charging Goddess is portrayed as a slightly larger than human-sized figure, mounted on a lion, surrounded by dwarfish male gayna, and preceded by a female warrior. Before her, she forces the measured retreat of a still very powerful-looking Mahisdsura, shown with a human body and a buffalo head, surrounded by his own cohort of anthropomorphic male warriors. Durgd is shown as a lithe and graceful figure seated astride the lion. She wears a crown and jewelry, a dhoti and a kuca bandha (breast-binding). With her two "natural" hands she wields the bow and arrow (implied rather than depicted), while her other hands hold (clockwise from her lower right hand) a sword, a bell, a wheel, and a conch shell, a noose, and a shield. The host of eight gana surrounds the Goddess like a halo. Four of them carry sword and shield. The one in the upper corner flies in with a tray of offerings. Those directly behind her carry the staff of the parasol extended over her head and a fly whisk, symbolic of her regal divinity. The gana below her imitates her pose, with a bow and arrow. The Goddess and her host occupy the half of the composition to the viewer's left. The opposite half of the composition is filled by the demons' retreat. Mahisdsura, still very much in the fight, stands hefting a club in his two hands, his body inclined at an angle of roughly thirty degrees, turning away from the Goddess in an impressive and dignified attitude. The poses of the surrounding members of his host, however, foretell the asuras' doom. Only one of Mahisa's demons is still in the battle, shield and sword in hand at the top center of the panel. The rest scatter in disarray. The demons at the corner and edge of the panel look to the rear, the upper turning and the lower beginning to flee. The figure in the lower corner has fallen, while the one closest to Mahisisura cowers beneath his 9 Cousens, p. 61. It should be pointed out that Cousens' interpretation of the Virapdksa inscriptions, following James Fleet's translations, claimed that the artists working there had come from Kanci, on the basis of references to their association with the "southern region". It is today recognized that the phrases involved referred in some cases to the southern side of the temple, and in others to a South India that included the region around Pattadakal. 289</page><page sequence="4">retreating master. Just who carries the parasol over Mahisa's crowned head is unclear. Beneath him lies the body of a demon who has fallen. At its center the opposing sides of the composition are joined by an interesting pair of figures (Fig. 5). Below is a female warrior, on her knees, striking upward with a short sword. Above is the torso of a male figure, with a shaven skull, falling head-downward onto her blade. This pair marks the division between the charging forces of the Goddess and the retreating forces of the demon, while at the same time it links them together within the composition of the scene. Aside from its miniature size and less commanding situation - just over a meter long, at the top of a pillar (Fig. 3) - the small relief in the Mallikirjuna is remarkably similar to the Mahabalipuram relief. Here too we see a dramatic scene, depicting the two opponents in the midst of their struggle, where Mahisdsura remains a strong and vital figure, and the outcome seems far from decided. The retreating demon with a human body and crowned buffalo head is depicted at the same thirty degree angle, hefting the club in his two hands. To his right is the slim figure of Durg., seated gracefully astride her lion, wielding the bow and arrow with her "natural" hands. Here too Durg. is eight-armed and carrying apparently equivalent ayudha symbols: a sword, something indistinct (that could be the bell), a wheel and an arrow in her right hands; a conch, a bow, something indistinct (that could easily be the noose), and a shield in her left hands. Though the panel is small and there is comparatively little space allowed for depicting the armies of the two opponents, four figures (apparently demons) are shown prostrate on the ground. Again there is the back view of a shaven-skulled man falling downwards, between the lion and the demon. In this case the falling figure's arm is clenched firmly in the lion's jaws. Here also Durg. wears a kuca bandha. Both works are located beside the sanctum of a Siva shrine, on the north of the axis leading to the sanctum, where the God's image is found. Which is to say, on the God's left. Or, on the worshippers' right, as they face the God (Fig. 4 and 6). Iconographically these are relatively unusual works and somewhat difficult to define. They do not fit exactly into any of the familiar pictorial or icon-text traditions, though there is little question about whom the figures are intended to represent. The scene depicts the battle between Mahddevi, the Great Goddess, who is the incarnation of the lakti (force) of all of the great Gods, and Mahisdsura, the demon who had defeated the Gods and driven them from their heavens. But, it does so in a way not cited in the familiar iconic texts or common among the material representations that now survive. In those images that have survived and have been recorded by scholars,to e.g., Figs. iI1, I2, I } etc., and in those Puranic and Agamic texts collected to explain them,"1 the imagery depicted is that of the climactic moment in which the triumphant Goddess strides over the vanquished body of her enemy, piercing him with her triiula (trident spear). Here, however, what we see is a penultimate moment in the contest, the battle before the Buffalo Demon's slaying. In o10 Seshadri's 1963 article is the best published. There is a Masters thesis at the University of California at Los Angeles, The Goddess Durgd, Mahisasuramardini in Indian Art, Katherine Anne Harper, 1969, which is more extensive. 11 E.g., T.A. Gopinath Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography (Madras, 1914), vol. I, pt. II, pp. 341-354. 290</page><page sequence="5">that form the Goddess is given many names; the most common associated with the actual incident of the combat are Kdtydyani and Candikd.12 In descriptions of the pratima (idol) and in those images that have survived, the two cosmic beings usually appear as a pair at the precise moment of the demon's destruction, accompanied occasionally by the Goddess's lion. In the two images we are studying and at Ellora, however, the scene is set before the Goddess's victory, and the figures are shown surrounded by a wide cast of characters, as a dramatic episode, not an iconic epitome. A better title than "Mahisisura-mardini" (the Buffalo Demon's slaying, literally: his crushing) for this imagery might be "Mahisasura sainyavadha" (the slaying of the armies of Mahisa). This is the title of the incident preceding the Mahis suramardinI incident in the Devi Mdhdtmya.13 (The advantage of this terminology lies in its description of the scene. We do not mean to suggest that that text is the specific source for these images. We will use it here to distinguish between this particular version of the theme, and others.) The relative uniqueness and the geographic and chronological proximity of the two works, combined with the similarity of their rendering, seem to assure the existence of a close connection between them. Only two other published images among the many known representations of the Goddess require comparison, the already mentioned Ellora relief (Fig. 7) and a relief found in front of the Atiranachanda Mandapa (Fig. 39, discussed below). But neither of these is as close to either, as they are to each other. In our pair we see the Goddess astride her lion and charging a Mahisasura, who leans away at an angle, separated from her by the falling torso of a shaven-headed man seen from behind. It is not just their similarity, but the combination of their similarity and their uniqueness that makes the suggestion of a direct connection between these designs seem unavoidable. On the basis of this analysis we are warranted in suggesting that the Mallikdrjuna and Mahisdsuramardini Mandapa images are related through the designers of one being familiar with the other, or at least with the work of artisans in the same tradition. However many the number of intermediary images or artisans, a linked chain of artisans and images must connect the pair. Neither verbal descriptions nor accident will explain such close similarity. The chronological priority of the Mahabalipuram relief also seems definite. The MahisdsuramardinI Mandapa is architecturally a monument bridging the Pallava's austere, so-called "Mahendra", style and the later, more ornate, "Mamalla" style.14 It combines elaborate versions of the geometric pillars of the austere style on its facade, with the lion-based pillars that characterize the ornate style inside (Fig. 6).is Though there is still a controversy over the exact date of the beginning of the ornate style, and the degree to which it may overlap its predecessor, there is general agreement on a late seventh-century date for the MahisisuramardinI Man dapa and the reliefs within it. The Mallikirjuna temple 12 E.g., the Mahdbhdrata, Visniudharmottara, Agni Purdna, Devi Mdhdtmya, Matsya Purdna, and Ripamandana. 13 We have used mainly V. S. Agrawala's edition, The Glorification of the Great Goddess (Varanasi, 1963), which has the Sanskrit text paralleled by Agrawala's translation. 14 See K. R. Srinivasan, Cape- Temples of the Pallavas (New Delhi, 1964), Chapter IV. 15 Srinivasan (1964), fig. 3, P. 41. 291</page><page sequence="6">at Pattadakal is dated by inscriptional evidence, firmly within the reign of the Calukya emperor Vikramdditya II, to whom it was dedicated by the younger of his two queens, between 733/4 and 744/5 C.E. (Saka 65 5-666), half a century later.16 We can, therefore, suggest Pallava inspiration in the Calukya image on the basis of their striking correlation of formal design and on the priority of the Pallava work. We can suggest Pallava inspiration, but we have not demonstrated it. What we have demonstrated is a sharing of characteristics, and a relatively direct coordination of the two images within a shared South Indian tradition. But, their relationship, the nature of that sharing, is not at all certain on the basis of what we have discussed thus far. Sharing, Intrusion, and Influence, Some Propositions Three positive criteria are required to establish the inspiration of one work or tradition in another work or tradition, or - as we say most often - to show one work or tradition has "influenced" another. These are a significant correlation of forms, the chronological priority of one, and the existence of cultural communication between their creators. We possess these positive criteria for suggesting the inspiration of the Mahabalipuram relief in the creation of the Mallikdrjuna work. They show the possibility of influence. To show the probability of influence we must also show two negative criteria: irst that no other outside source could have provided the inspiration, and second that it could not have come from the Calukya tradition itself. It goes without saying that when we suggest any connection between two works we mean a connection existing in the activity of their designers. Works themselves do not absorb the influence or inspiration of other works, but only record the impression made by other works upon the artists who create them. There is a theoretical possibility that the designers of one of these works was aware of the other work, but the fact we must face in considering the art of ancient cultures is that we are dealing with a miniscule number of surviving images from a vastly larger body of work. This makes the likelihood of finding two works directly connected through the person of a single artist, who created one in emulation of the other, extremely unlikely. The practice of reading the concrete record of surviving images as if it was all that ever existed is as misleading as it is convenient. In reality it is no more likely that what we see today is a large part of the art that once existed than it is that the names of people inscribed on those images and in associated texts represent a large part of the Hindu population of that time. The images we have from the first millenium are the fortunate survivors of a vast number of images in more perishable materials, and a good number in stone as well, which have since been lost. And we should treat them as such, as surviving representatives of a vastly more extensive corpus. Being in stone or metal, and often from temples of great political and historical centrality, they are undoubtedly among the most refined and 16 James F.

We may relate specific works from the well documented production of modern artists like Picasso or Braque to one another, to recreate their history. We know of their personal relations. We possess quite complete records of their production. So, we may string their works together into a reasonably full skeleton of their production. But working with the fortuitous survivals of a long past tradition, we are engaged in a paleontology that cannot recreate the past form by merely stringing together whatever we find. We must always assume a far more extensive and developed structure than the concrete evidence at hand, to explain and connect the fragments we discover. Most of what is commonly referred to as the specific influence of one work upon another is traditional sharing: two works drawing upon a common tradition. That is one of the first things that our small relief in the Mallikdrjuna has to tell us about Sivaramamurti's analysis, with which we began. Though its lion-borne Goddess at the Kaildsa may owe something to Pallava tradition, its Mahisa does not have the buffalo head found at Mahabalipuram. It has a human head with buffalo horns, a type which we find elsewhere in the Calukya tradition, but not in the Pallava tradition. The Kaildsa work is drawn from the same tradition represented in the Mahabalipuram relief, but from a strain distinct from that found among the Pallavas. The Puranic theme of Mahddevi (the Great Goddess) created out of the energy of all of the great Gods to combat Mahisdsura, is common to every region of India, and it is popularly represented in the temple and popular art of every region as well. It existed in the Deccan earlier, as well as contemporary with and later, than the Calukyas, who were among the first to have it committed to stone there.7" Within the surviving corpus of stone images left to us by the Calukyas and Pallavas we know of some ninety images of Durga's combat with Mahisdsura, fifty-four Calukya and thirty-four Pallava. These are not ideosyncratic inventions, but traditional, sacred depictions, produced by consciously traditional artists within prescribed and well-established formulas. Though relatively few works of these traditions have survived from the sixth, seventh, and eighth-century heyday of the Calukyas and the Pallavas, we know that these few stone survivals represent great numbers of lost images in stone, metal, wood, plaster, clay, straw, sand and paint, not to mention hymn, narrative, drama, mantra, puja, conversation, and consciousness. That these stone survivals are typical of those lost images in perishable media, we may reasonably assume. The strong conformity of the survivals seems to guarantee a relatively similar conformity among those images that have been lost. When we look at the full range of surviving stone representations of the theme from this time, the continuity of the images within their traditions is quite impressive. This is as true beyond the South Indian realm of the Calukyas and Pallavas as within it. Which is not to deny the significant individuality of most pieces, but only to emphasize the fundamental ground of pervasive sharing upon which that individuality figures. 17 The earliest surviving Mahisdsuramardini imagery in the Deccan is the third-century Sannatti fragment illustrated here (fig. 27), and discussed below. Other pertinent examples are those found at Peddamudiyam, Jogeswari, and Elephanta. These are already in the styles found among the Calukya's zoomorphic imagery seen below. 313</page><page sequence="28">To demonstrate the influence of the tradition of the Mahabalipuram image on the Mallikdrjuna image we need to show not only that they are alike and that the Maha- balipuram image came first, but also that there was no alternative source, equally capable of supplying the features we wish to attribute to the Pallavas. And we must also show that there is reason to believe that the Calukya tradition itself was not likely to have produced these developments without the aid of outside models. In fact the imagery of the Goddess seated upon her lion is relatively rare outside of southern India at this time, and the depiction of Mahisa as a composite, buffalo-headed, human-bodied figure battling the Goddess to a draw, as we see him in this particular scene, with the shaven-headed falling figure, is unknown elsewhere. But is this imagery charac- teristic of the Pallavas? Could it not have grown up among the Calukyas? The Mahisisuramardini legend is pan-Indian. The earliest surviving plastic images of Mahisdsuramardini to be identified within the two traditions we are concerned with, are found among the Calukya monuments of Aihole and Badami, in the second half of the sixth century. These are as much as a century earlier than the oldest surviving Pallava images. This, however, does not demonstrate that the Pallavas took the idea of creating sculptural representations of Mahisdsuramardini from the Calukyas, only that such imagery was committed to stone in the Calukya region earlier. Earlier plastic images can be found, at Sannatti in Karnitaka18 and Peddamudiyam in Andhra'" for instance. The earliest surviving representations of the image of the Goddess as the slayer of Mahisisura, in the South, however, may be that occurring in the Tamil Silappadigaram, where not only the Goddess, but her worshipped image as well are mentioned, at a date considerably prior to the Calukya's emergence.20 This by no means proves that the Calukyas inherited the concept of the Goddess from the Pallavas. Each of these instances of the theme's ap- pearance in the surviving record demonstrates nothing more than the existence of the common theme in these particular places and times. It is more likely that they indicate the continuing presence of a shared theme among various communities of both Tamilnad and Karn.taka, than the exclusive possession of either one. To go beyond the bland generality that priority among related forms in a sparse list of survivals proves little about priority in creation, we need to distinguish among the several sorts of sharing possible. Of the three most interesting forms of sharing, we tend most often to discuss the most unusual and to confuse the others with it. That is influence: the power of one cultural form to change other cultural forms. Most traditional works are created to follow conventional models. Only a few break out of this pattern to emulate unorthodox alternatives. But out of a long established habit we have often tended to link similar pieces like successive beads on a string, by referring to "influence", supposedly relating each later work to its predecessors, when what we have observed is conventional 18 See below. 19 C. Sivaramamurti, Early Eastern Chalukya Sculpture, Bulletin of the Madras Gonernment Museum, vol. VII, No. 2 (I962) pl.I. 20 The date of Silappadigaram is still highly controversial, but there is considerable evidence to place the work around 45o C.E. See Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature (Wiesbaden, 1974) and his Smile of Murugan (Leiden, 1973). 314</page><page sequence="29">sharing. One image or style may influence other images or styles, but this is more rare than is usually acknowledged. When discussing influence it is important to distinguish between limited influences, where one or two specific pieces seem affected, and more significant influences that effect an entire tradition. The most extreme example of influence is the copy, a piece such as the modern reproduction of the image in the Mahisasuramardini Mandapa for sale as a souvenir (Fig. Io). But as totally influenced as it is, the souvenir copy does not show an important cultural influence. The Mahisisuramardini images in contemporary Tamil homes and temples (like Fig. 37) do not resemble this design. There are two important sorts of sharing we should distinguish from influence. The most common of these is simple sharing: drawing upon the same cultural sources. The imagery of Mahisdsuramardini exists throughout India by the sixth century of the common era. Any image after that time showing a Goddess with a conch, a wheel, a trijila, and a lion, or combat with a buffalo, is likely to draw on that well-known theme. Peculiar features in any particular rendition of the theme might be attributable to particular regional, chronological or individual causes, but the essentials of the Mahisdsuramardini theme are a pan-India sharing. Wherever it occurred in the seventh to eighth century the Mahis-sura sainyavadha imagery would have been a variation on a familiar local imagery, differing only in details from what was already present. What was unusual about the imagery we may call an intrusion: an entering into local patterns of something that was not there previously. Intrusions may come from local or foreign sources, that is, they may be inventions of borrowings. If, as we shall see, there are six other Mahisdsuramardini images at Pattadakal and this is the only one to show Durgd seated upon her lion, then that element of the Mallikirjuna's design is possibly an intrusion. Though whether it was an invention or a borrowing may be a question. To show that something is an intrusion rather than a sharing we must show that it does not already exist in the region into which it is said to appear. Take for instance the presence of a small Orissan bronze image of Mahisisuramardini (Fig. 8) in a home in Amherst, Massachussets. There is no native American tradition of creating such images, and so this work and the tradition which it represents were both brought into their present cultural situation as an intrusion from the outside. Or take the Mahisisuramardini painted in red on the side of a building in Aihole in the mid g196o's (Fig. 9). For all of its iconographic and design likeness to those that have existed at the site for the preceding fourteen centuries, the shaggy African mane on the Goddess's lion, and the classical Mediterranean shape of the pointed helmet she wears, are foreign intrusions. The appearance of the characteristic Indian imagery of the Orissan bronze in Massa- chusetts hardly represents an influence of Indian upon American culture. It is a borrowing that as yet has no important cultural subsequence. Influence is power, and cultural influence is the power to change cultural patterns. If someone were to begin to reproduce images in some way modeled upon the Orissan bronze we could say that it (and so Indian culture) was having an influence in America. But even so, only if a significant portion of American imagery were to be adapted to that phenomenon could we say that American culture was being influenced. 315</page><page sequence="30">And indeed this is the case with the adoption in wide areas of Indian imagery of the great-maned, African lion of British imperial imagery. We see this lion in Durga imagery of contemporary lithographs (Fig. 37) and stone carving. We see it around the Lok Sabhd buildings of the national capital. And though few realize that this is an imperial replace- ment of a previous national formula, it records an attempt of nineteenth-century Indian artists to adapt to traditional uses a major symbol of a contemporaneous foreign power. As such, it records a genuine impact of the foreign conquest. To demonstrate that the presence of the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery in the Mallikdrjuna is either an intrusion into Calukya culture or an influence of Pallava upon Calukya culture, we must consider the full imagery of both traditions to see if it belongs to either any more than the other, and to see if it represents a change in one to the characteristics of the other. Early Calukya Images of Mahadevis Struggle with Mahisasura When we survey the more than fifty surviving Early Calukya images of Durga's struggle with Mahisdsura, we find a variety of visually distinct iconographic traditions, including two shared with the Pallavas and two apparently unknown or uninteresting to them. We will give examples of each, beginning with those unknown among the surviving images of the Pallavas, which are in fact the most common among the Calukyas. The Goddess in the form of Mahisisuramardini is given a prominent location in the Saiva temples of the Early Calukyas - as in those of most South Indian traditions - where she regularly appears in an independent dei-ak6stha (niche) or independent shrine preceding the sanctum of Siva, to the God's left. Which in nearly all Siva shrines means to the north of Siva.21 The earliest of surviving Calukya Mahisdsuramardini images, like most Calukya images of this theme, are in a form quite different from the combat which we have been examining. They do not represent the Goddess astride her lion in the midst of a battle, but standing over the demon at the moment of her triumph, with one leg or foot resting on his purely animal (zoomorphic) form, transfixing him with her trijfla. At Aihole in the earliest surviving Calukya example of the theme we can identify, the demon is shown as a helpless victim, its head bent back over the Goddess's knee as she pierces its body with the spear-end of her trijfla-headed staff (Fig. I1i). The Goddess here is shown wearing a kiri~ta mukuta (jeweled crown), iiras cakra (ruff-halo), earrings, wrist and arm bands, anklets, necklace and the typical Calukya string of pearls that hangs from her neck, crossing between her breasts and splitting around her hips. She wears a short dhoti (lower cloth wrap) and her breasts are apparently left uncovered. To her left her lion mount stands passively observing the Goddess's formalized destruction of the demon. In her eight hands she holds (clockwise from her lowest right) a sword, a parrot, a wheel, the trisila, a bow, a conch, a shield and the beast's muzzle. With the exception of the parrot, 21 This is true for all significant images (avaranadivata) found in situ. Decorative images such as those in candraidlds on the M-legitti Sivalaya and Naganatha may be elsewhere. 3Ib</page><page sequence="31">the combination and the right-left distribution are a standard that will continue. This image can be attributed, with the rest of the Rdvana Phadi cave, to the middle of the sixth century. It is carved on the left wall of the antaradla that connects the sanctum with the hall.22 A continuation of this imagery can be found in the Jambuliniga Temple at Badami, dedicated in 699 C.E.23 There is a small image of Mahisdsuramardini located on the mandapa's outer wall, on the north, where it was once the udgama crown of a Northern style de-vakos.tha (Fig. 13). Only about a foot high, the Goddess is shown with four arms, but otherwise in the standard form established in the Rdvana Phadi: one leg on the ground, the other upon the zoomorphic buffalo. The natural left hand grasps the beast's muzzle while with the right she pierces its neck with the triisla-headed staff. In the second pair of hands are raised her lahkha and cakra, the wheel and the conch. The lion is shown on the Goddess's right. There is an iconographically equivalent image inside the attic of the temple's porch ceiling. A very graceful portrayal of Mahisisuramardini from later in the reign of Vijayiditya (696-733/4 C.E.) can be seen in the Durgi Temple at Aihole (Fig. i2). Here a slender and elegant Goddess stands with her left foot upon the buffalo's back plunging the trijila into its neck. The twisting animal rears its head, but it has obviously been overcome with little effort. To Durga's right stands her lion mount. Here as in the previous cases it seems to come from behind the Goddess. Durgd has eight arms of which three are broken. Those remaining hold the sword, the arrow (or vajra), wheel, trij~dla, bell and conch. The natural left hand was either on the beast's muzzle, where a bit of broken stone remains, or held a shield answering the sword on the opposite side. The other probably carried the bow. She wears a jeweled crown ofjata (hair), a siras cakra, and elaborate earrings, necklaces, armlets, and bracelets. Once again as standard, she wears a lower garment with a jeweled girdle, and her breasts are apparently uncovered. There are ten other examples of this iconographic form among the temples of the Calukya's Karnatak region, and five among the Calukya sites of Andhra Pradesh. The small image from the miniature shrine by the door to the sanctum of the Kumira Brahma Temple is a four-armed version of this type, from Andhra (Figs. 15 and 16). It shows how closely linked the two regions of the Calukya empire were artistically. The miniature, Southern style shrine is of the standard pattern. It has figures cut into three of its four sides, and was probably intended to stand, as it does now, against its temple context with its blank fourth side. As usual the central image is a Siva LiTiga, with a Ganapati on the right and the Goddess to his left, making it a complete miniature temple.24 We will end our discussion of the most common Early Calukya vision of Mahisasura- mardini with the one that comes from beneath the major Vishnu avarana panel on the north 22 The dating of Calukya monuments here is discussed in Gary Tarr, "Chronology and Development of the Early Chalukya Cave Temples," Ars Orientalis 8 (1970), pp. 15 5-I84; and Gary Michael Tartakov, "The Beginning of Dravidian Temple Architecture in Stone," Artibus Asiae, XLII,I (1980), pp. 39--99. 23 James F. Fleet, "Sanskrit and Old-Canarese Inscriptions no. LXXXIV," Indian Antiquary, vol Io (1880), pp. 61-62. 24 Both the piece's completeness, as a temple itself, and its unusual placement here, inside a shrine and on the God's right, indicate that it was moved here fortuitously, and is not part of the original conception. 317</page><page sequence="32">wall of the Virupaksa Temple at Pattadakal (Fig. 14). The Virupaksa is the contemporary and matching pair of the adjoining Mallikirjuna, marking with it the climax of the Early Calukya tradition. The dynasty was submerged by the Rastrak tas in the following decade, and so this image, with the Mahis.sura sainyavadha, marks the end of that tradition. Mahddevi, Durgd is shown here with six arms. She stands with one foot on the ground and the other on the buffalo's back, holding his muzzle with one of her natural hands and piercing its neck with the triji~la in the other. Her upper arms carry the usual wheel and conch. Otherwise, the conventional arrangement is taken out of its usual iconic isolation and located within a complex scene, showing the ritual context as well as the Goddess. Along with the lion we are used to, we see opposite it in this panel a stag, another of the Goddess's mounts. And flanking her there are a demonic looking female devotee and a pair of human worshippers, to whom she is offering her blessing (varada mudrd). The one on her right can be seen holding his topknot with his left hand and reaching with his right as if to cut off his own head.25 This zoomorphic version of the Mahisdsuramardini image is the most common form found in the art of North India and the Deccan in the preceding centuries. In its earliest known depictions, of Kusdn times, the Goddess is shown holding the buffalo up by its neck and literally crushing it, as her name implies. By the end of the Kusdn period the buffalo has all four legs on the ground, and from the Gupta period on it is killed by the thrust of the Goddess's trijila.26 By the sixth century this can be seen at Elephanta and Ellora, in Mahraistra, Peddamudiyam in Andhra and in the North.27 In an alternative version of the theme, dating from late Kusin times, the Goddess holds the buffalo partially off the ground by its tail or hind leg and presses down upon his head with her foot. Four examples of this form survive among the Calukya monuments of Karndtaka and fourteen among their remains in Andhra. The Mahisdsuramardini of Cave I at Badami (Fig. 17), is the best-known example of this form. It can be attributed to the third-quarter of the sixth century.28 It occupies the central position in a separate shrine, that stands just outside and to the (proper) left of the temple's facade, where it is flanked on adjoining walls by images of Ganapati and Kdrttikeya. Durgd here is shown characteristically four-armed and standing with her left foot planted firmly on the ground and her right on the head of the buffalo. With her natural right hand she drives the pointed staff of her trident through its neck, while with her lower left hand she holds its tail, lifting its body completely off the ground. As usual her breasts, 25 For the location of the image see Tarr, Fig. 30. Though such self-mutilation is best known to academic literature as a phenomenon of the South, it is found in the North in sculpture as early as the Gupta period; see George Michell et al., eds., In the Image of Man (New York, 1984), Fig. z 5 6, a terra cotta from Mathura. It is known in the ritual practice mentioned in the Devi Mahatmya, and is familiar in Bengal; see D.C. Sircar, ed., The Sakti Cult and Tadra, (Calcutta, 1967), P' 7, and below, here. 26 This history is discussed in Seshadri (1963) and more recently in Gritli von Mitterwallner, "The Kusana Type of the Goddess Mahisasuramardini as compared to the Gupta and Medieval Types," in German Scholars on India, vol. II (Bombay, 1976), pp. 196-2 13. 27 For the Elephanta piece see Moti Chandra, Stone Sculpture in the Prince of Wales Museum (Bombay, 1974), pl. 76.

A version of this type from Andhra can be seen in a miniature shrine within the compound of the Bala Brahma Temple at Alampur (Fig. Is8). It was once believed that this variation of the theme was the Gupta standard,29 which could be traced earlier than the form where the Goddess holds the buffalo by the muzzle or tongue. Pioneer historians of the region supposed it to be the earliest of the two forms in Karn.taka, and even called it the Kadamba type, identifying it with the dynasty from coastal Karn.taka who preceded the Calukyas.30 As far as we can tell, however, both versions of the form exist throughout the Calukya region for the full span of their rule. Though, in later times, the head down version more or less disappears from Andhra while it remains a great favorite in western Karnrtaka.31 Among Seshadri's four types of Mahisdsuramardini images this most typical Calukya form fits into his first category, where the demon is seen as a water buffalo plain and simple. It is the most common form of the iconography found throughout the Deccan and North India before the eighth century, and familiar though with diminished popularity, after that. It is, however, a form of the iconography that is not known to occur among the monuments of the Pallavas. Seshadri's illustration from Vellore, which he calls seventeenth century, is one of the few examples we know from Tamilnad.32 The Goddess's slaying of the demon, as she stands dismounted from her lion and triumphant above him, takes place only after an extended combat. In the Devi Mdhdtmya, chapters 81 to 93 of the Mdrkanydeya Purdna, the best known of the texts commonly used by worshippers and scholars for explaining these images, this scene occurs at the end of the third chapter, "The Slaying of Mahisasura", (chapter 83 of the full Purdna) in verses 20o-41, following a chapter devoted to the slaying of the demon's armies.33 Before this throughout the later part of chapter 2 and the first half of chapter 3 the Goddess is sometimes seen upon her lion and sometimes on foot. At 2.34 after receiving her person and attributes from the assembled Gods, "The Gladdened Devas spoke to her seated on a lion". While at 2.37-8 she is seen, "bending low the earth with the force of her strides". Throughout the later portion of chapter 2, which is titled "The Slaughter of the Armies of Mahisa", a battle rages in which Mahisa's host, but not Mahisa himself, is laid to waste. At 2.54 the gayas of the Goddess attack the asuras, at 2.5 5-5 8 the falling of the demons is the repeated topic. It is only at 3.20 that the last battle with Mahisa occurs, "as his army was thus being destroyed, Mahishisura assuming his buffalo form terrified the Ganas of the Goddess". And finally the climax of the battle takes place at 3.37 where "she jumped and landed herself on the Great Asura and pressing her foot on his throat struck him with her spear". 29 Seshadri (1963), pp. 7-8; Mitterwallner, p. zoo-zoi. 30 George M. Moreas, Kadamba Kula (Bombay, 193 1), p. 3 15. Seshadri (1963), note 28, p. 8, explains Moreas's mistake, though many still follow its lead. 31 Mitterwallner illustrates several; P. Gururaja Bhatt, Antiquities of South Kanara (Udipi, I3969) contains a number of others. 32 Seshadri (1963), pl. II5A. There are three post-Pallava examples in the State Transport Museum at Mahabalipuram, which seem to us to be imported. 33 Agrawala, pp. 58-63. 319</page><page sequence="34">Throughout India during the course of the eighth century there can be seen a shift away from the purely zoomorphic depiction of the Buffalo Demon, toward a depiction in which a human figure is shown emerging from the neck of the buffalo whose head has been severed. Various stages of this metamorphosis are found in the texts as well as sculptures. And many texts, as well as many sites offer alternative versions within the same context. In the description of Candikd, the ten-armed form of Mahddevi as the slayer of Mahisdsura, in the Agni Purdna, the Goddess is said to be shown riding upon a lion and killing the Buffalo Demon with her trifila, without any reference to his body changing form.34 In the section describing an image of the Goddess that is twenty-armed, she is said to kill the demon in a form where he emerges in his human form from the neck of the buffalo.35 But in sections where her image is described as twenty-eight-armed, like that where she is ten-armed, she is described simply as decapitating the buffalo, or killing the buffalo.36 Most of the texts that we have been able to check describe the demon in the manner found at 3.3 8-9 of the Devi Mahatmaya, as half-issued or half-revealed coming from the neck of the buffalo in a human form: 3.38. Thereupon trampled under her foot, the Asura half-issued forth from his buffalo mouth in his real human form, was completely overcome by the valor of the Goddess. 3.39. The Great Asura in his half-revealed form continued to fight until the Goddess cut off his head with her great sword and laid him low.37 The Rastrakiltas, who replaced the Calukyas as the rulers of the northern and western Deccan in the middle of the eighth century (c. 757 C.E.) were the first to produce this metamorphic depiction of Mahisdsura in the region (Fig. 3 6).38 As with the zoomorphic form of Mahisdsura, which was the form known at Ellora before the middle of the eighth century,39 this metamorphic form is unknown among the Pallava remains.40 Though there is no Early Calukya example of the metamorphic transformation, one stage of it, the final stage by some accounts, showing the Buffalo Demon in human form is found. This is the second distinct sort of Early Calukya imagery of Mahisdsuramardini. In it the demon is depicted as anthropomorphic, but for his diminutive buffalo horns.41 Six examples of this imagery survive. As far as we can tell, from the monuments in which they are found, they come from the end of the Early Calukya period. 34 Agni Purdna, 5 z, 16. 35 Agni Purdna, 5 o, 1-6. 36 Agni Purdna, I 3 5,z (according to Marie-The~rse de Mallmann, Les enseignements iconographiques de rAgni-Purna (Paris, I963), p. 143. 37 Agrawala, p. 63. 38 The earliest to survive, that is. In our judgement the images in this form at Calukya sites, such as the one on the boulder behind the Buthanatha Temple, are Rastrakuta in date. None are integral in a Calukya monument. 39 See the example cited in note 27, above. 40 This is Seshadri's Type IV, (1963), pp. 2i-27. 41 Seshadri illustrates two examples of this imagery under his Type III, "Combination of Man's body and buffalo's head," along with the Mahabalipuram and Kailasa Mahisdsura sainyavadha images. But he fails to notice that these heads are human, and only their horns refer to the buffalo, (1963), pp. 20 and 27 and pl. 27. 320</page><page sequence="35">The best known example of this anthropomorphic Mahisdsura is the image that still occupies its original place on the altar of the shrine inside of the man.dapa of the Virpaksa Temple at Pattadakal (Figs. 19 and zo20), opposite a complementary shrine of Ganapati. This is a stunning work, that only a heavy coating of offerings has prevented from receiving much greater, modern interest. Mahisasura is depicted here as a human figure, with only details like his nobby (Buddha-like) hair, fangs and unusually long ears to identify him as a demon, and only buffalo horns to identify him as Mahisdsura. He is shown on his knees. Durgd stands above him, her left foot raised onto his head, plunging the sword as well as the trisjla into his breast. She is shown with eight arms, carrying the usual attributes in the usual order: trisjla, sword, wheel, arrow on her right, bell, conch, shield and bow on her left. She wears a conical mukuta and halo, and the usual armlets, necklaces and earrings. She does not wear the kuca bandha. The image is exceptional for the quality of pathos in the rendering of the demon's expression and plight. Two examples of this version of the theme can be seen on the Pdpandtha Temple at the same site. The latest of the two works (Fig. 22) is in the interior of the temple's forward man.apa, where it stands in a divak stha at the center or the northern wall, opposite a matching divakjstha containing Ganapati. This image is somewhat disintegrated but still readable. The Goddess is eight-armed, standing over the human torso of the demon, who has already emerged from the buffalo's body. He is shown bent backward in a pose that graphically mimics that found in the zoomorphic buffalo images. The buffalo's severed head lies below in a three-quarter view. Devi's lion is seen entering the fight from the side. Devi here has one foot upon the torso of the demon bending him backwards as she wields the bow and arrow in her natural hands, the trijfla with which she transfixes him, wheel, and sword; the conch shell and shield. (One of her left arms is broken at the elbow.) This image is highly dynamic, twisting from a rear view of her hips to a full front view of her upper torso. She wears a karan.da mukuta and no kuca bandha. The forward mandapa was added to the original temple in the reign of Vikramdditya II (73 33/4-744/5 C.E.), contemporary with the creation of the Viripaksa. This is seen from both the stylistic point of view in general and from the particular presence of the sculptor Baladeva, who signed his work on a ddrapla (door guardian) of each: the north dvdrapdla of the Pdpandtha's outer mandapa's entrance, and the eastern dvdrapdla of the southern entrance to the Viripaksa.42 The image on the exterior of the Pdpanatha (Fig. 21) is part of the slightly earlier sdndhdra man..dapa, surrounding the sanctum, from late in the time of Vijayaditya (696-733/4 C.E.). Though slightly less dramatic in its pose it has come down to us in a better state of preservation than the other. Here too the Goddess stands over a human-torsoed demon with one leg placed firmly on his chest. Seven of her eight ayudhas are visible. With her right hands she pierces the demon with her triJzla, carries the sword and draws an arrow from the quiver behind her back. On her left she holds the conch, bell, shield, and bow. The combination is consistent with those inside, suggesting the bell as the missing ayudha there, and the wheel found there as the missing weapon here. It is possible that she wears 42 A. M. Annigeri, A Guide to the Pattadakal Temples (Dharwar, I961), pp. 19 and 42. 3 i</page><page sequence="36">a kuca bandha here. The severed buffalo head is visible below, in profile. Upon Mahisa's human head, there is a crown of snailcurled hair and buffalo horns. He carries a club. A fourth example of this version of the theme, uncovered during the Archaeological Survey's clearing of the site in the last decade, is now in the site museum. There are also two examples of this form from outside of Pattadakal. One is a much abraded image that once formed part of an exterior wall of the (now partially dismantled) Bhadravaliniga Temple at Mahakuta.43 The other is found on the north side of the entrance to the sanctum of Vikramdditya II's samddhi at Bhadra Nayakana Jalihal, between Pattadakal and Maha- kuta.44 There are two examples of this type in the Kaildsa at Ellora. One is an iconic image comparable to these, on the north of the mandapa (Fig. 35).45 We have already mentioned the other, the Mahisdsura sainyavadha image of the western wall (Fig. 7). A major dif- ference between that image and the others, which has gone unremarked by those who have compared it to the Mahisdsuramardini Mandapa relief, is the anthropomorphic head of the Buffalo Demon, with only buffalo horns to identify him. It is characteristic of the Kaildsa that it contains both the most advanced imagery of the Early Calukya's temples, as seen in these two images, and a further evolution, in the metamorphic image (Fig. 36), which is the most prominently displayed of the three. By contrast, the third sort of Mahisdsuramardini imagery found among the Calukyas remains (Seshadri's Type II)46 is one they share with the Pallavas. This is imagery of Korravai, the Victorious Durgd,47 standing alone and erect and usually over the severed head of the slaughtered Mahisdsura. This imagery exists in five examples among the remains of the Early Calukyas. The best preserved example of the Victorious Durgd is in the Alampur Museum, and appears to have come from the Vilva Brahma Temple at that site, where it occupied the (now) empty niche on the north of the garbha grha antardla (Fig. 23).48 Devi is shown here standing upon the squarely frontal head of the buffalo. In her hands she holds the trifila, wheel (on edge), conch shell, and the ka.ti hasta gesture, resting on her jeweled girdle. She wears simple bracelets, armlets, necklaces, earrings, a crown, and no kuca bandha. A second example of the form is found on a miniature shrine to the south of the passageway leading from the Bdla Brahma to the Tungabhadra (Fig. 2 ). It shows a four-armed Goddess standing in dvibhatga on the head of the buffalo. A highly unsophisticated and partially unfinished image with similar characteristics is found on the north, over the shrine run-off, of the Bhimalifigeivara Temple at Satyavolu 43 The Archaeological Survey of India has a photograph showing the image still intact. 44 M.

The imagery at this site is, as a rule, quite a distance in both quality and in content from that in the dynasty's heartland or its high period. Devi here is shown holding the wheel and abhaya mudrd to the right, the conch shell and kati hasta on the left. Instead of being held, the trijla floats or stands as a standard behind her, as it sometimes does in Tamilnad.50 She is accompanied by the deer on her right and the lion on her (upper) left. And she wears the kuca bandha. The image is too weathered to tell for sure if the form upon which she stands is the Buffalo Demon's head. The fourth Early Calukya example of the Victorious Durgd is still in situe on the north devakdstha of the garbha grha of the Bdla Brahma Temple at Alampur (Fig. 24).51 The Goddess here holds a sword and the tridla in her right hands, a bell and either a fruit (phala) or cup (kapdla) in her left hands. She does not wear a kuca bandha. In a variation of this imagery she stands upon the backs of divergent lions. Wear makes it difficult to tell if a buffalo head was once here too, on the slab below. The fifth example of the type is somewhat problematic, but interesting. It occurs on the north of the Kotilifigu Temple, just inside the main entrance to the compound, at Mahakuta, on the left. Unfortunately this single example of the theme at one of the dynasty's Karnatak sites is largely hidden from view by a Laja Gauri image, that for many years has lain against it. It stands over a buffalo head, but little else can be seen. Its temple is one of the latest Early Calukya structures at the site.52 With the Victorious Durgd imagery we move again into a situation that has been attributed to some sort of influence. Unlike the most common Early Calukya Mahisdsura- mardini tradition, this image type exists among the Pallavas as well as the Calukyas. And it is not only more numerous among the Pallava temples, but so much more familiar to art historians in Tamilnad as to be generally assumed an essentially Tamil icon. But as Seshadri has pointed out, we are faced in this imagery with an inconvenient situation. "This interesting type became very prominent under the Pallavas of Mamallapuram. [But] when did it originate? It is not easy to find the answer with certainty."53 The diffusionist tendency to derive an imagery's origin from its earliest surviving example is here con- fronted with the contradiction of the motif's association with another region altogether. Seshadri hesitates to attribute the motifs origin to the Pallavas, because of the enigmatic existence of the imagery in a single, isolated, colossal version found at Besnagar in North India and datable to the fifth century (Fig. 28).54 Straining with the desire to attribute the imagery to the Pallavas, he says, "If this figure is Pre-Pallava, then, the interesting fact 49 Odile Divakaran, "Les temples d'Alampur et de ses environs au temps des Cdlukya de Baddmi," Ars Asiatiques XXIV (1971), Fig. 41. 50 E.g., at the Adivardha Mandapa (Fig. 41), the Kaildsandtha (Fig. 46) or Singavaram. s5 This is one of the earliest Calukya temples at Alampur, from the later part of the seventh century. See Divakaran, figs. 6, io-ii and I3-i 5. 52 The temple currently houses a Linga, though it is not definite that that was originally so. Still, the Durgd (north), Surya (east), Skanda (south) combination does urge a Saiva dedication. 53 Seshadri (1963), P. 15. 54 The date is based on similarity of the dress to the dated images at Mandasor and to Deogarh. 323</page><page sequence="38">emerges that this provided the model for sculptures of the same type from Mamallapuram, (in the) 7th century A.D."55 The Besnagar Durgd is a six-armed image combining both of the alternatives we have seen among the Calukya's Victorious Durgds. She stands on the severed head of the Buffalo, which rests on the backs of divergent lions. This imagery is otherwise unknown in North India. Should we therefore attribute the Pallava seventh-century style at Maha- balipuram to the inspiration of this specific piece and go on to attribute the late seventh to early eighth-century Calukya images to Pallava influence? We do not believe so. To string known examples of an imagery on a single chronological thread is to assume that they are all that ever existed, when in actuality they are, as we have emplasized earlier, but the rare survivors of a much more numerous population. The continuing presence of the Victorious Durgd type in Karndtaka in figures at Hale Alur, Binnamangala,56 Nandi,57 Kunigal and Kampanayura,58 and in Andhra at Bik- kavolu,59 shows that the motif was not limited to Tamilnad but popular in the southern Deccan as well. Though several of these images are from the tenth to eleventh century period when the Tamil C6la dynasty held important sway in southern Karndtaka, and both Kampanayura and Binnamangala are C6la dedications, we can still distinguish Deccan as well as Tamilnad features among them. Both the lack of the kuca bandha in the figures from Bikkavolu and Hale Alur, and the presence of the divergent lions along with the buffalo head at Kampanayura and Bikkavolu distinguish these images from anything in Tamilnad. They indicate the continuity of long standing Deccan traditions, not the borrowing of outside traditions. What we are thus faced with is not a simple case of one known-image influencing the creation of another known-image. It is, rather, a complex sharing of traditions, in which ideas and artistic forms as well as people have traveled, and where the occurrence of a motif beyond the region in which we are familiar with it is more appropriately recognized as the surfacing in the survival record of a local tradition, than as the rare occasion of a foreign intrusion. For, as we are beginning to see, there are distinct differences as well as congruences between the Karnatak and Tamil versions of the theme. If this case against diffusionism were not strong enough already, the time between the original and the latest drafts of this discussion has brought us yet another bit of evidence of the indigenous creativity diffusionism often hides. The Directorate of Archaeology and Museums in Karn.taka has found a fragment of a terra cotta plaque representing the Victorious form of the Goddess from the (third century, C.E.) Satav-hana site of Sannatti (Fig. 27).

I and 2. 59 Unpublished. 324</page><page sequence="39">plus an adoring gan.a.60 So the earliest surviving representative of the theme we know now is one from the northern Deccan. Unquestionably others will be uncovered to replace it, twisting the diffusionist's string of supposed influences into ever more unlikely knots. The last Early Calukya version of the Mahisdsuramardini theme that we have to consider takes us back to the Badami caves and the third-quarter of the sixth century. It is a small carving, under i i inches in height, located in one of the ten narrative panels that decorate the lintels of Cave II's porch.61 The lintel on which the scene is located faces out from the central bay of the porch, beneath the ceiling with the wheel of fish spokes (Figs. 29 and 30). Most of the panel is taken up with a scene of the great Gods proceeding toward Sri, in the form of Gaja Laksmi, at the center of the panel. The west end of this scene blends into the scene of Durga as Mahisisuramardini. Since the image is small and difficult to decipher, either at the site or in a photograph, we are also providing a diagram originally published by James Burgess (Fig. 3 I).62 Durg- here is shown striding to her left, grasping a composite Mahisa with a buffalo head, and striking at him with her trijfla. She may have four arms, as Burgess's diagram shows. Beside the trisla it is possible to make out the vertical blade of the sword on her right. On the left one hand grasps the beast's horn, while another seems to hold the conch shell. Another pair, holding the wheel and the shield, may be there as well. Her decoration is difficult to make out, but she wears no kuca bandha. Mahisisura is shown here in a composite form with a buffalo's head on an anthropomorphic body, as he is in the Mahisdsura sainyavadha images. And indeed the scene extends beyond these two figures. Durgd is accompanied by no less than six supporting figures, including the lion by her back leg. Mahisa is shown with three, one of whom is trying to flee and one who lies already crushed beneath the Goddess's legs. Another Calukya example of Mahisisura as a composite figure is found as a decorative detail on the Viiva Brahma Temple at Alampur (Fig. 32). Here on a pilaster flanking the western window-porch is an image of the Goddess astride a rearing lion, aiming an arrow at the still aggressive demon.63 This is a highly dynamic representation of the theme. As usual among Calukya images, the Goddess wears no kuca bandha. An exceedingly weath- ered stone in the Kittur Museum, that once lay beside the Vishnu Puskarini at Mahakuta, may be a fourth example of this imagery. It shows the Goddess astride the lion, pursuing a fleeing, club-wielding demon, whose head is worn beyond recognition. These images with the composite Mahisisura do not occur in icons, but in narrative depictions of the combat, the Mahisisura sainyavadha, at a penultimate moment, prior to Durga's climactic slaughter of the demon. They form a complementary pair with the 60 We thank the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums in Karn.taka, for making this piece available to us, and allowing its publication. 61 These lintels are fully discussed in R.D. Banerji, Basreliefs of Badami, Memoirs of the A.S.I., No. 25 (Calcutta, 1928), pp. 19-24. 62 James Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples and the Brahmanical andJaina Caves in Western India, A.S.I., N.I.S. vol. 5 (London, I883), pl. VIII. 63 This image and some others were pointed out to us by Dr. Carol Bolon. 325</page><page sequence="40">anthropomorphic portrayal of Mahisa at the moment of the slaughter. Together they show a development of the plastic depiction of the Mahisisuramardini theme. What in the Kusdn and Gupta periods was depicted by a single emblem, of the slaughter of a zoomorphic buffalo, Early Calukya artists sometimes differentiated into stages, marking the transition from the combat to the slaughter by the transformation of the demon from his zoomorphic to his anthropomorphic form. Post-Calukya Mahisisuramardini imagery in the Deccan incorporates this explicit depiction of the demon's transformation into the iconic image itself, showing Mahisa in the composite form, and in the more elaborated, metamorphic imagery, of the emergence of an anthropomorphic demon from the buffalo's body. As with the Victorious Durga, the composite Mahisisura imagery of the Mahisisura sainyavadha is one the Calukyas share with the Pallavas. And also, like it, it was an iconographic form occurring earlier in the Calukya region, and in several examples. When we see the full scope of Early Calukya imagery of the struggle between Mahidevi and Mahisdsura, we find some confirmation for the initial suggestion that the Mallikirjuna image of the Mahisisura sainyavadha reveals the intrusion of something new into Calukya imagery, but also distinct limits on the scope of that intrusion. And though the possibility of Pallava influence in this particular image exists, the suggestion of significant Pallava influence in Calukya art is precluded. The composition of the Mallik-rjuna relief is undoubtedly close to that in the Maha- balipuram relief. The angle of Mahisisura's stance, his pose with the club and his crowned buffalo head are closely shared by both works. So too are the Goddess's pose astride the lion, the distribution of attributes, and her kuca bandha. The inverted falling man caps all of these sharings. Together they reveal a close connection between the two designs. Close not because of their likeness alone, but because their likeness is not shared by other Calukya images. Of the fifty some examples of the theme we know, only two others have the Goddess astride her lion, and in only one or two does she wear the kuca bandha. Comparison of the style of the two works shows that the artists were not the same, and that the artists responsible for the Mallikarjuna relief were not working in the Pallava style. The pneumatic volumes of the Mahabalipuram image and the smoothly continuous contours of its major forms, so characteristic of the Pallava style, are not visible in the Pattadakal image. The technique here is typically Karnatak or Calukya: the surface is broken into irregularly joined contours and flattened volumes that are more organic than geometric in their rendering. These differences in technique are not due to differences in materials. They are differences in style. Each of these works is patently the product of its distinctly local, regional style. A design may have traveled here, but it is clear that artists have not. Nor is there any reason to suspect that the theme or its use at Pattadakal owes any debt to the Pallava tradition. The popularity of the subject, its placement within the temple, and the depiction of all but a few details of its design were all well-established elements of the Calukya tradition. Its most conspicuous element, the buffalo-headed composite form of Mahis.sura, had reached the stone record in the Calukya region a century earlier than it had in Tamilnad. What is unfamiliar here in Early Calukya art is the Goddess's sitting astride her lion, her use of the kuca bandha, the presence of the falling man, and the 326</page><page sequence="41">particular composition of the scene, with Mahisa's angled stance and the lion-seated Goddess each surrounded by their hosts and separated by the falling man. What we have here does not seem to be an influence of the Pallavas upon the Calukya culture, but a sharing between the two that may reveal a possible intrusion of a specific Pallava design variation of a shared theme into a single work of the Calukya tradition. Significant "influence" would mean an adoption by the Calukya artists of a Pallava motif. But there is no adoption here. No other examples of the design are known. And as yet we have no reason beyond our familiarity with the Mahabalipuram relief to believe that the shared motifs are peculiarly Pallava. Both could be drawn from a third source. What we have is sharing, one rare instance of two images in different traditions linked by close roots in a common source. We know the design has features unusual for Calukya art. But, as yet, we have no proof of its appropriateness to the Pallava tradition. To know if these characteristics are Pallava we must look at the Pallava imagery of Mahisdsuramardini. Pallava Images of the Struggle Between Mahddevd and Mahisasura An investigation of the Pallava images of Mahisisuramardini and related works show- ing the Great Goddess reveals that for all of its prominence within our academic and tourist literature and for all of its splendid esthetic qualities, the panel in the Mahisisura- mardini Mandapa at Mahabalipuram (Fig. z) is not at all typical of Pallava iconographic traditions. And it is least typical in the characteristic features it shares with the Mallikdrjuna relief. Of the thirty-five examples of this theme we have been able to study, there is only one other full rendition of the Mahisisura sainyavadha, and one excerpt. There are three other formats for depicting Mahisisuramardini, but these neither show the combat nor Mahisa in the composite form of a buffalo-headed, anthropomorphic being. After a consideration of the two works that share the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery with the panel in the Mahisisuramardini Mandapa we will describe the three more typical forms of Durga imagery seen among the Pallava remains. The second Pallava portrayal of the battle of Devi against the armies of Mahisa comes from Saluvankuppam, the little fishing village two miles north and hardly separate from Mahabalipuram. It is found on an irregular slab of granite now located a few meters in front of Rdjasitirha Pallava's early eighth-century Atiranachanda Mandapa. The relief has been attributed, along with the mandapa to the same time as the Mahisdsuramardini Mandapa.64 The slab is somewhat irregularly finished toward the right end, and measures about one by two meters (Fig. 39). The scene is clearly derived from the same visual tradition as the panel in the Mahisi- suramardini Mandapa, but for all the closeness of its design and the style of its execution, its iconographic details lack the similarity found in Pattadakal. Like the other depictions of the Mahisisura sainyavadha Durga is shown upon her lion pursuing Mahisisura and his host. The moment of the combat depicted is a step advanced from the one seen in the cave here, and a step earlier than that seen in the Badami cave (Fig. 30). Mahisisura has 64 Srinivasan (I964), PP. I25-130. 327</page><page sequence="42">abandoned his hope of triumph; he has dropped his club and turned to flee. While Durga, surrounded by her host, is beginning to dismount from her lion, in preparation for the ultimate engagement. The Atiranachanda Mandapa relief shows the Goddess six-armed, dismounting from her lion, in the midst of eleven or twelve gana. In her arms she bears the sword, the wheel and the abbaya hasta (gesture) on the right and the conch shell, bow and cup on the left. She wears arm and ankle bands, a pointed crown and the kuca bandha, standard in Tamilnad. Unlike the mandapa's portrayal of Durgi astride the lion, she appears here with one foot raised on the haunch of the lion, and the other stepping down onto a lotus pedestal, as if she were in the act of dismounting. Mahisisura is shown in the composite form. His arms and hands swing in wonderfully rhythmical gestures (Fig. 4o). His figure and expression are certainly the esthetic high point of the work. He is preceded in the retreat by a demon of his own size, in a tall headdress. Another demon is sketched out in hand and face in the upper corner. The scene is completed by the Goddess's gana, who fill every region of the panel left to them. Against the edge one gana below carries a club, while one above blows a conch shell. In the upper corner is either a third with a deer-face, bearing the parasol, or the Goddess's deer vdhana. Directly behind her are three more, one with a fly whisk at the top, one with a sword and shield, and one at her feet. Beyond her, six gana and the lion beset the fleeing demon. Two brandish swords and shields, while a lion-faced one bites the demon on the elbow. Two more descend directly upon Mahisa's head, while the last one descends toward his collapsing accomplice. There is no trace here of the inverted, falling figure, prominent in the other two panels. An abbreviated version of the theme can be seen on a sometimes submerged boulder just north of the Shore Temple, called the Mahisisura (mardini) Rock (Fig. 5 8). Here, on the side of a boulder into which an altar of the Goddess has been cut, Mahisa is seen in flight, alone, with his club tucked under his arm, and the lion pouncing upon his back and biting his horn. The Goddess is not shown as taking active part in the demon's downfall, here. Rather she appears in a more formal representation within an architectur- ally framed niche, cut on the boulder's east, flanked by dvdrapdla and rearing lions (Fig. 59). Of the more common types of Pallava Durgi imagery one is shared with the Calukyas: the Victorious Durgi who stands erect upon the severed head of the Buffalo, a lotus pedestal, or flush with the floor. Typical of these images is the figure in the dFvak6sthba to the proper left of the Trimurti Mandapa at Mahabalipuram (Fig. 44). Durg* is shown here standing erect in the bendless, samabhanga, pose with eight arms bearing abhaya mudrd, bell, sword, and wheel on the right, conch, bow, shield, and katyavalambita hasta on the left. She wears jewelry, a crown and a kuca bandha. The buffalo's head is shown frontally, with an emphasis on the contrast between the horizontal double bow sweep of the horns and ears and the wedge-like projection of the head. The most elaborate image of this sort is the one found in the Adivaraha Mandapa (Fig. 41).65 There she is eight armed, like the image at the Trimuirti Mandapa, and carries 65 The ParamE vara-Mahivardha-Visnu-Grham; Srinivasa (1964), pp. 166-175. 328</page><page sequence="43">the same attributes, with the substitution of a cup for the abhbaya mudrd and the presence of a parrot on her left wrist. She differs further in her dynamically posed, triple-bent stance, with her right leg crossing behind her left ankle. She stands upon the buffalo head, and like the image we have seen outside of the Virupaksa Temple at Pattadakal (Fig. 14) she appears in the midst of an elaborate worship scene. Behind the Goddess stands the trijila, as a standard (stambha). To either side gana fly in, bearing the fly whisk and a box of offerings. In the upper corners stand her alternative vdhana, the lion and the stag. To either side below are a standard pair of female pratihdri (guardians) one carrying a sword and the other a bow. At her feet kneel male devotees: the one on her left gestures with respect, while offering a lotus, the other holds a dagger in his right hand against the wrist of his left, in the act of offering his own blood as a sacrifice. The worn figure on the rear (east) of the Draupadi Ratha is similar to these (Fig. 42), though it possesses only four arms: abhaya and kayavalambita hasta in the natural hands, the wheel and conch in the raised pair. She is samabharga on the buffalo head. The less finished images of the shrine's northern and southern niches are roughed-out to match this one. The Draupadi Ratha is a Devi shrine, with the image inside an alternative version of the Victorious Goddess, showing her standing upon the lotus rather than the buffalo head (Fig. 43). Aside from the exchange of pedestals she is closely comparable to the images we have just examined. Her natural hands are in abbaya and katyavalambita mudrds, the upper right carries the wheel, and the (now effaced) upper left most likely carried the conch. She is shown samabharga and wearing the usual garments. Like the image in the Adivardha Mandapa, she is the center of a worship scene. Her attendants here include two pairs of gaina flying in above and two male devotees kneeling below. The devotee on her left seems to hold his hands in the adjali mudrd of respect, while the other holds his topknot with his left hand and gestures as if to cut off his head, with the sword crossing behind his neck in his right. The pair ofpratihdri seen within the panel in the Adivaraha composition are visible outside here, flanking the doorway. The justification for calling this figure the Victorious Durga and associating it with the slaying of the Buffalo Demon is both visual and textual.66 Our earliest reference to the Victorious Durga in the South is found in literature, such as the Silappadigdram's references to "Korravai, the Victorious Goddess who carries in her hands a glorious spear and stands upon the neck of a defeated buffalo losing its blood through its fresh wounds.67"' And, How come you to appear,... standing on a wild buffalo... You came wandering on a stag that proudly bears black antlers. You hold in your bracelet-laden hands a sword dripping with blood after you killed the buffalo demon... Why must you stand on a fierce lion whose eyes shoot darts of flame, holding in your frail lotus hand a discus and a conch?68 and to whom her devotees pray, 66 Srinivasan (i96o), pp. 2I-30o, follows a similar logic. 67 Ilango Adigal, Shilappadikaram (The Ankle Bracelet), trans. Alain Danielou, (New York, 1965) (Ch. XX), pp. 126. 68 Shilappadikaram, (Ch. XII, "Hymn to Shalini"), pp. 8o-i. 329</page><page sequence="44">Accept the blood that flows from our severed heads, the price of a victory you granted... Accept the blood and flesh we offer in thanks for victories... Virgin goddess! Accept our blood, our sacrifice performed before your altar in fulfillment of the Eiynars' vow. The tigerish warriors lie prostrate now, before the lotus of your feet.69 We see among these of images a full interchangeability of attributes, ritual associations and temple location, most of which can be extended to the Calukya imagery already considered. Other Goddesses such as Jyesthd or Laksmi have quite different iconographic traits and occur elsewhere. The version of the theme in the Varaha Mandapa - which is like the Adivardha Mandapa and Badami's Cave II unusual among the temples we have considered in being Vaishnava - combines these attributes another way (Fig. 45). The Goddess here stands samabhahiga beneath a parasol, upon a lotus pedestal, with a broken (abhaya?) hand, wheel, conch shell, katyavalambita, and wearing the kuca bandha. Four gan.a fly to her, carrying a casket of offerings, a sword and a fly whisk. The lion and the stag are in the upper corners. The self-mutilating and lotus-offering devotees kneel at her feet. All of these images from Mahabalipuram can be dated to the reign of Rdjasimha, Narasimhavarman II Pallava (c. 695-7z8 C.E.), though many would have them half a century earlier. The Durgd image at Iravdtane-vara in Kanci (Fig. 49) is different from those just mentioned in that it is part of a structural temple, rather than a rock-cut one. And it is likely to be of a somewhat later date, in the eighth century. In comparison to the rock-cut temples, the structural temples were more systematic in their application of the prescrip- tions of the Agama and Silpa texts. As K. R. Srinivasan has pointed out, "The Vaikhanasa- Agama ... assign(s) to the Durgd figure a place in the de-vako-sh.tha outside the northern wall of the ardhamangaapa of a Saiva temple as Vindhydvasint, a feature that becomes common from the close of the 8th century onwards, the corresponding south niche containing Ganapati."70 Rdjasiriiha's structural temples and indeed most Pallava structural temples are Saiva and put this prescription into practice in the first-quarter of the eighth century. The rock-cut shrines are less consistent for a variety of reasons. Some were Vaishnava of Sdkta rather than Saiva. Some consisted of interiors only, with no exteriors intended or surviving. Some, out of a desire to use an attractive site, faced in unusual directions. And apparently they were less thoroughly regulated by these still fledgling rules. Typical of the Pallava structural temple whose imagery has survived intact the Iravita- neivara has a panel representing Durgi in a de-vakds.tha on the north of its ardhamanGaapa (porch) wall. Here she is flanked by (at least one) female pratihari of the type we have become accustomed to, and a stag on the proper right. The proper left is damaged. She stands flat on the plinth, in a dvibhahiga (double-bent) pose, with six arms. Among her weapons can be made out a bow, and a wheel on the right and a conch shell and katyavalambita hasta on her left. She wears the usual kuca bandha. Behind her, looking out on her right side, stands her lion. 69 Shilappadikaram, (Ch. XII, "Turaippattumadai"), p. 83. 70 Srinivasan (i96o), p. 22. 330</page><page sequence="45">Of the sixteen images of the Victorious Goddess we know among the Pallava remains, seven stand over the severed head of Mahisa, three stand upon lotuses, and four flush on the level of the floor. The image in the Rdmdnuja Mandapa is too carefully erased to read, though its close association with the other caves suggests that it would have had the lotus. This form of the Goddess is shared by the Pallavas with the Calukyas, as we have seen. It is found mainly at the Calukya sites closest to Tamilnad, in Andhra at Alampur and Satyavolu. Though there is one example in Karndtaka. The earliest surviving example of the theme comes from Sannatti, in northern Karn.taka, and later examples are known in both Andhra and Karndtaka. Outside of these South Iridian sites, this imagery of the Goddess, in the form where she stands erect over the severed head of Mahisa or an equivalent, appears rare. The only example we know is the one from Besnagar (Fig. 28). (Though we should note that the head-down version of the zoomorphic form, e.g., Figs. I7 and 18, popular from the fourth century on, may be a Northern variation of it.) Since it makes up about half of the known Pallava examples of the Goddess, and is quite popular in later times as well, it has become associated by scholars with Tamilnad. But as we have seen, it was important in Andhra and Karn.taka as well. Without a thorough study it is difficult to say just how comparable are the numbers of these images surviving in the other regions of Drdvida style. In any case, it is clear that this is not a peculiarly Tamil iconography. It is a Drdvida imagery, with Calukya as well as Pallava substyles in the late seventh to early eighth centuries. As with the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery, the Deccan version of the imagery has a distinct visual style, and distinct regional attributes. The second typical form for showing Mahddevi in the monuments of the Pallavas can be called the Pallava Sithhavdhini (lion-borne), Durgd. Unlike the Victorious Durgd it has no really comparable equivalent outside of the eighth century art of the Pallavas. In the standard Pallava Si hhavdhini image Durgd does not sit astride the lion, but like the figure at the Atiranachanda Mandapa, is shown seated sideways or leaning against it, with one foot on the ground and the other (usually the left) raised up on its back. The lion normally appears to crouch behind or beside her. As a typical example we can consider the major Durgd of the Kaildsandtha at Kanchi, the ten-armed image of the western niche of the vimina's northern wall (Figs. 46 and 48), from the reign of Rajasirhha (c. 700-728 C.E.). Standing on her straight right leg she lifts her left foot to the lion's upraised paw, as it turns out toward the viewer. Devi holds the wheel, the sword katyavalambita (on the hip), and ka.taka hasta (as if holding a flower), while drawing an arrow on her right. On her left we can see the bow, shield, axe, and katyavalambita hasta, with one arm missing. A parasol is extended above her head and a triidla is visible behind her, like a standard. She wears arm and ankle bands, a pointed crown, and the usual kuca bandha. Closely similar images stand on the north of the ma~naapa,71 the western shrine of the southern parivdrdlaya, and at the southern entrance to the parivdrdlaya.72 71 Approaching the situation advocated in the Agamas. 72 Illustrated in Rea, pl.

For instance the eastern vimina of the Shore Temple, the Ksatriyasimhe-vara, at Mahabalipuram (Fig. 47). Here the dvak os.tha holding the Goddess and the lion is flanked by niches containing gana. Below, gan.a with swords flank and separate a pair of devotees, kneeling beneath the pilasters of the divak.stha, in attitudes of sacrificial self-mutilation. The one on Devi's right cuts at his neck while the other is piercing his hand or offering a lotus. One of these Pallava images of the Goddess actually does sit astride her lion. It is found as a secondary panel on the north side of the Kailasanatha (Fig. 3 3). Because of the weathering it is only apparent that this figure sits astride from the position of her left foot, appearing below the lion as if emerging from behind. The lion is rearing back and the Durg. is shown four-armed, like the Calukya image at the Viiva Brahma. We know eleven examples of this variety of Durgd among the Pallava temple remains, none of which includes explicit depiction of Mahisdsura. (This is the reason that Seshadri has ignored it altogether, in his survey.) And yet, like the Victorious Durg., where it occurs separate from the depiction of Mahisa's head, the Sirmhavdhini Durga is closely connected with the theme of Mahisdsuramardini by its associated imagery. It occurs on temples in the same location as the Victorious Durg., as an alternative to it. This is a location similar to that where the Victorious Durg. and the Mahisdsuramardini imagery of the Calukya temples is found: on the north of the sanctum or the man.dapa of Siva temples, on either the interior or exterior. It shows the Goddess as Mahddevi in her cosmic or universally independent form, bearing the weapons we find on this form when she is depicted with Mahisdsura (usually including the conch and wheel, bow and arrow, sword and shield, and often the trij~la), seated or leaning back upon the lion, wearing the kuca bandha. It too sometimes occurs in association with the stag,73 bow-wielding pratihdri,74 and the self-mutilating devotees.75 In the images of the Iravdtanaevara (Fig. 49) and the Tripurantakaevara76 we can see the Victorious Durg. and Sirmhavahini imageries melded, as the Victorious Durg. with the lion behind her or as Sirhhavdhini standing off the lion. The final form of Mahisdsuramardini we may distinguish as a separate type is found in three images where the Goddess is found seated upon the head of the Buffalo. Two of these offer an interesting twist to the concept of her being sithhavdhini, or lion-borne. The best known of these, though seldom recognized, is found in the photogenic lion on the south of the Shore Temple compound (Figs. 5o and 5 1). This popular lion, on its finely wrought pedestal, is the Goddess's vahana, and the most visible surviving element of an elaborate expression of the MahisSsuramardini theme. Cut out of the same stone is the (now headless) form of the stag, along with a gan.a groom (also now headless) (Fig. 5 2). Seated on the haunches of the lion are the two pratihdri. And within the square cavity in the lion's breast is an eight-armed image of the Goddess, seated upon the head of the Buffalo (Fig. 53). 73 As in the Airdvatesvara and Iravdtanesvara (fig. 49). 74 As in the Iravdtanaivara (fig. 49). 75 As in the Ksatriyasirihhevara of the Shore Temple (fig. 47)- 76 Rea, pl. CXI, fig. 2. 332</page><page sequence="47">She is in the same one-leg-up (pratydldha-like) pose she takes upon the lion. Though small and worn, a number of her usual attributes are legible. Like the Mahisdsuramardini Mandapa image this one too is paired with a Anantasayana Vishnu. The stone from which it is carved is actually part of the living rock of the site, connecting (out of sight) with the recumbent Vishnu of the oblong shrine between the Shore Temple's taller spires.77 A very similar imagery is found in the Durga Rock, on the beach south of the Shore Temple (Figs. 54-56). The imagery in this case is greatly worn, due to greater exposure to the sea, and it is also more complex, extending into associated royal consecration imagery. The Durgd Rock includes the pair of pratihari behind the lion (one is visible in Fig. 54), eight ga.na, the head of the stag (Fig. 56), and a pair of self-mutilating devotees (below the cut-out, Fig. 5 5) as well as Devi seated upon the Buffalo Demon's head, within the lion's breast. Taken with the nearby Ydli Rock the combination of elements here includes most of the imagery seen in the Ya!i Mandapa at Saluvankuppam, and a separate lion throne as well. The similarly posed lion image on the north side of the Ya!i Mandapa is only roughed-out, and the panel set in its breast is blank, but we can hardly doubt its intended imagery included the same scene as that found in its equivalents (Fig. 57). The image inside of the Mahisdsura (mardinl) Rock (Fig. 5 9) also seems identifiable as this type. We can thus see the Pallava imagery of Durga as Mahddevi Mahisdsuramardini exists in a large number of examples, which can be classified into four iconographic types. Two of these types, the Durga Simhavdhini and the Durgd seated on the buffalo head, do not occur among the Calukya's monuments. The other two, the Victorious Durgd and the Mahisasura sainyavadha, are shared with the Calukyas. We will conclude this survey by mentioning the single seated image that shares this iconographic nexus within each tradition. There is a four-armed figure seated in lalitdsana on a throne beside the Sithhavdhini image on the north side of the Kaildsandtha (Fig. 46). She wears the kuca bandha, and sits between heads of the lion and the stag. A four-armed figure, carrying the wheel and the conch and also seated in lalitdsana, can be found at the top of one of the hall pillars of Badami's Cave II (Fig. 34). The four accompanying figures are all worshippers. The lower two may be involved in self-mutilation. Primitive Influence Theory The importance of influence extends far beyond the neutral geographic issue of where a particular motif first appeared and where it subsequently reappeared. By their premises, discussions of artistic imagery form parts of a broader discourse on creativity, and discussions of art history refer to discourses on originality and independence in creativity. And there exists an implicit contrast within these considerations between independent and creative work on one hand and dependent, derivative work on the other. When this discussion takes place across cultural boundaries it implicitly raises the issue of creative or independent versus derivative or dependent cultures. 77 This linking of the two deities also occurs in the Devi Mdhitmya. 333</page><page sequence="48">When we suggest that one work has been influenced by another, we are qualifying the originality and independence of the designers of that work. We may specify our qualifica- tion as more or less important, but there is no question that we are setting limits on the value of the work. Derivative work is less respected than original and independently creative work. Consequently discussions of influence are often pejorative. When dealing with appreciated artists or works we may reverse this logic and devalue their supposed sources. In either case the issue is the same. Some works and artists are defined as creative and valuable while others are declared to be less creative and so, of less value. Though we may recognize conventional sharing in highly valued works, it is not the sharing but the originality of the variation on the conventional pattern that we have chosen to admire in bourgeois society. Whether we consider the production of a particular artist or of an entire community, we confront similar issues of value judgement. To define a work or style as essentially derivative is to brand both the work and the artistry that produced it as relatively inferior. When we speak of works of one region being derived from works of another we are suggesting the dependence of the receiving culture upon the originating culture, and the inferiority of the receiving culture to the originating culture. Most discussions of artistic influence do not intend to raise the broad ideological problem of what constitutes an inferior or dependent culture, or the broader question of whether or not such judgements can be separated from the subjectivity of our necessarily ethnocentric vision. Most specific references to supposed instances of influence between communities may not intend to reckon with cumulative estimates of the relative creativity or cultural independence, of the communities to which they refer. And yet whether or not they intend to, they raise these issues. It is impossible to avoid raising them, since they are implicitly assumed in the language of influence.7" Hierarchical value judgements are implicit within our discussion of art. They are a major concern of bourgeois esthetic thought, and a major concern of our intercultural thought as well. This is important, when we consider applying a modern Western system of cultural analysis, like art history, to a traditional non-Western culture, since our understandings are deeply biased by their fundamental grounding in our own traditions. Elsewhere we have (separately) pointed out the Western problem of dealing with the Indian Buddhist caitya hall as if it were in some way dependent upon European basilica architecture,79 and the fundamental claim of nineteenth and early twentieth century Western historians that much of Indian culture is essentially derivative.so It is also important when we consider - as we do here - the claims of rival communities that are still contended over, by their cultural descendants in modern Karnataka and Tamilnadu, and where our historical analysis is prejudiced by a tradition which has incorporated strong political biases about more and less "martial", "creative," and "dependent" races or cultures. 78 The one book that deals with the meaning of influence in detail is Goran Hermeren, Influence in Art and Literature (Princeton, 1975). 79 Vidya Dehejia, Early Buddhist Rock Temples (London, i972), pp. 74 and 2i8, note 3. 80so Gary Michael Tartakov, "Changing Views of Orientalism," PupulJayakar Festschrift, Lokesh Chandra, ed. (forthcom- ing). 334</page><page sequence="49">The alternative framing of the same considerations of cultural exchange presents them in the more value-neutral terms of sharing. In this case, extreme claims of artistic indepen- dence and dependence are avoided, and the underlying traditional patterns that all artists draw on are emphasized. When the fact of shared traditions is taken as central, value judgements about originality, creative independence and esthetic quality are still possible, but they are subordinated to issues of communal cooperation and development. In bourgeois culture analysis is focused upon the competition among alienated individuals which is the social ideal, and a language appropriate to that social model has been developed. But in traditional culture it is solidarity among producers that is the ideal, and conceptualizations expressing that social ideal are more appropriate. When we attribute any occurrence of an identifiable sharing, like the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery, to the influence of the first example we know upon all subsequent examples, we are practicing the crudest sort of influence theory. Though such a primitive theory may tell us something about a simple case of forgery, plagiarism, or copying, it cannot account for the more complex situation of normal cultural creation. It will explain the similarity of the Nashville, Tennessee Parthenon to its prototype in Athens, but not the similarity of the Parthenon to the Temple at Zeus at Olympia or the Temple of Poseidon at Paestum. It will explain the relation between Henry Cousens' plan of the Virfipaksa and the temple, but it will not explain the similarity of the Virfipaksa to the Kailasandtha at Kanci. It can account for little more than the simplest and most automatic copying. Primitive influence theory is premised on an asocial or non-cultural, blank-slate vision of human creativity. It supposes that likenesses between human creations are the result of simple copying, by one artisan of another's form. It fails to recognize the rich matrix of cultural traditions within which human creativity takes place. It misses the essential fact that even a copyist's recreation is accomplished through an elaborate conceptual process that involves a structural understanding as well as the surface "look" of the work they reproduce. It reduces the consideration of material objects to the look of their surfaces. Primitive influence theory can comprehend the creation of a minor relief of Durgd, such as the miniature beside the doorway of the Kumara Brahma's sanctum (Fig. 16), to be essentially the copying of a prior one. It is as if the creator did not know what Durga should look like, or was expected to look like - what made her image identifiable and satisfying. Though we are relatively safe from such reasoning when we consider the familiar and respected art production of our own society, we are vulnerable to it in considering the unfamiliar work of a foreign tradition. For lack of deeper and richer cultural familiarity we easily reduce the study of historically distant production to com- parisons of the surviving remains, without consideration of the entire world of cultural activity and production from which they come. Of necessity the earliest Western studies of Indian art suffered disproportionately from this approach, and more recent work has progressively improved upon it. In fact the reconsideration of such primitive and an- tagonistic approaches characterizes a great deal of recent work. Analysts' sympathies with the culture or artists they consider and their understanding of the complexity of the creative process are no less important than their familiarity with 335</page><page sequence="50">the nuances of form. The same person who might think of a fine soloist's rendition of a Chopin Etude as "original" may turn around and call a Tamil short story with a Heming- wayesque style "derivative". Any decent Western musician or listener realizes that to reproduce a score adequately one cannot just mimic the notes, but must understand the structure of the composer's musical and dramatic intentions. A concert musician of the Western classical tradition is not a typist repeating instructions, but a recreator of complex esthetic intentions. And yet unsympathetic partisans of the more independently inventive tradition of Indian music could, if they chose, avoid this reality and condemn Western concert music as continual repetition of the same pieces, by long-dead composers. The masters who cut the Kumdra Brahma's miniature Mahisdsuramardini would not have likely been mere copyists even if their intention was only to recreate another, similar piece. Given the well understood conventionality of the theme there is no likelihood whatsoever that any master would have thought it necessary to look anywhere for a particular model, any more than any reader of this article would need to find a particular model to draw a guitar in the margin of this page. Yet simple influence theory, in the form of casual dismissal of less favored or less familiar monuments as being little but derivation, has had a full and popular life. We will quote one example of such an analysis by Herman Goetz: The Chilukyas were not so much creators as mediators in the field of art. In the north they came in contact with the provincial Gupta civilization of the Deccan and the later imperial civilization of Gujarat and Northern India, in the south with the Andhras, Pallavas and Cholas, in the west in trade relations with the Sassanian empire via the ports of the Konkin and of Gujardt, and with Indonesia via Andhra, and were later involved in wars with the Muslim governors of Sind. Chilukya art thus passed through several phases. The first was that of the early 6th century, at the earliest capital Aihole on the Malprabhd river... The oldest Siva shrines, i.e. the Kontgudi group and the so-called "Lid Khan" ... are mere adaptations of the later Buddhist monastery type... On top of the Ldd Khdn there is a small chapel like an early Gupta temple... On the pillars of the front gallery of the Lid Khan there are three-quarter life-size figures of the river goddesses and of yaksha (Gandharva) mithunas, in Gupta costume and imag- ery, but in their general character descendants of the relief groups in the old Sdtavdhana cave temples. Clumsy, poorly proportioned, they nevertheless have the charm of a naive honesty and directness. The most remarkable monument of this style, however, is the Durga (Fort) temple, an adaptation of a Buddhist chaitya hall,... its sculptures cover all the transitions from homely figures in the manner of the Lid Khan to great masterpieces of the later Gupta style... The free-standing temples, especially the Malegitti Sivalaya and the temple on the Northern Fort, reveal the Gupta style of sculpture at its zenith, but their architecture reminds one rather of Pallava architecture in the transition period from the Mahendra to the Mimalla style, though without the exaggerations of the latter... The Pallava occupation after the death of Pulakesin II in 642 is probably responsible for a Pallava monument, the small but very fine Saiva cave temple at Aihole, with sculptures and painting in the best Mimalla style.8' 81 Herman, Goetz, India: Five Thousand Years of Indian Art (Baden-Baden, g196o), pp. z123-125. 336</page><page sequence="51">The Calukya art of this account has no independent existence. Or at best its independent existence is interesting only where it takes on derivative forms. In fact what is going on is the reading of Calukya remains by someone who does not know Calukya art, but is familiar with Gujardti, Gupta, Pallava and Indonesian art. Failing to understand what is longstanding pan-Indian, Deccan, and South Indian practice within Calukya tradition, he sees what is shared in common as the particular property of those in whose work he first noticed it. Without going into all of the specifics of this analysis, which should be clear enough as an example of the meaninglessness of primitive influence theory, we will note only its last statement, since it has already been dealt with here. The Saiva cave temple at Aihole, Goetz mentions, can only be the Rdvana Phadi from which we have seen the Mahisdsura- mardini image (Fig. i i) that our survey of Pallava imagery shows to have no possible Pallava source. Quite to the contrary, it is clearly an integral example of Calukya imagery. The same can be shown for the rest of the imagery in the temple. The architectural design is typical of the northern Deccan and has no parallels in Tamilnad.82 Style and Cultural Autonomy An adequate model for considering cultural sharing and social communication requires recognition of the complex cultural traditions internalized by every individual member of every society, and of the complex process by which imagery is produced. Such a model is necessary to comprehend the complexity, depth, and consistency of social traditions behind and within individual cultural activity. Social development takes place within a cultural field of invisibly shared consciousness as well as visibly shared traditions. All social communication is based upon this sharing of internalized mutual expectations. Any specific instance of close cultural sharing takes place within a context of a broad and pervasive general cultural sharing. If the Mahisdsura sainyavadha relief in the Mallikdrjuna Temple was based upon a Pallava design it could have reached its Calukya location only because it was essentially understandable through the sharing of the legend, its symbolic details, the tradition of plastic depiction, its location, the appropiateness for local Saiva practice, etc. Nothing but the Goddess's pose, the presence of the kuca bandha, the falling figure, and the organization of the scene seem to be unusual for the Calukyas. The amount of Pallava influence in this single piece can thus be seen to be minimal. Or it would be, if we could say that these elements were Pallava. Which in this case we cannot. The kuca bandha is unquestionably characteristic of Pallava art. But the falling man is no more characteristic of Pallava than Calukya traditions. It exists in only one case in each tradition. And though the Goddess is regularly seen against or with the lion in the Pallava tradition, she is seen astride the lion in only one other case (Fig. 3 3); she is seen astride at least as often with the Calukyas, and earlier in North India.83 If this feature 82 Tartakov (i980), pp. 96-99. 83 For instance the image in the Lucknow Museum (5 5.2o01), from Bhitari, dated to the sixth century, N.P. Joshi, Catalogue of the Brahmanical Sculptures in the State Museum, Lucknow (Part I) (Lucknow, I972), pl. 52. 337</page><page sequence="52">surfaces earlier among the Pallava remains, the equally characteristic buffalo-headed, composite Mahisa is found earlier in the Calukya's remains. The iconographic composition survives in these two cases only. Still the large scale and importance of the Pallava version and its earlier date, than its smaller Calukya counterpart, when taken with the quotation of the Tamil-standard kuca bandha, suggest the possible existence of a Pallava work's influence on the composition of this Calukya design. What seemed at first an example of Pallava influence in Calukya art turns out to be an example of a rare Pallava work whose design may have been quoted once in a minor Calukya decoration. Seeing this as a significant cultural influence is only possible if we take our contemporary familiarity with the Pallava piece as a measure of its original importance, and hold as unquestionable the century-old Western art historical conviction that the Pallavas were an important source for Calukya culture. The problem with primitive influence theory is not only its simplification of cultural complexity but its anti-social portrayal of cultural interchange as an antagonistic relation- ship between culturally superior, independent creators and culturally inferior dependents. To move beyond a primitive influence theory to a coherent theory of social communi- cation it is necessary to treat comparisons of particular images rigorously in terms of the full fields of social activity that produced them, rather than the narrower and less appropriate fields of our contemporary interest in a few attractive survivals. Particular examples of sharing must be considered in terms of social sharing in general. Whether these sharings are examples of mutual continuity, intrusion from one community to another, or influences of one group upon the creativity of another, can only be understood in terms of the wider field of cultural sharing in general. Where Goetz reduced the Early Calukya tradition to the copying of other traditions, we must see it first as autonomously creative of what it understood of contemporary Indian traditions. Within that creativity - equal to any Kannada speaker's ability to form and interpret coherent Kannada sentences and any Hindu's to explain the Goddess's triumph over Mahisdsura - they provided images of Mahisdsuramardini. At that point, if they took some specific guidance from a Gujarati or Pallava image seen in passing it was likely to be as minor as our example above. What matters fundamentally is the Calukya or Deccan culture's sharing with Tamils and Gujaratis the common background of the patterns of pan-Indian tradition. That is a profoundly positive phenomenon, expressing the underlying unity and coherence of Indian tradition across provincial, regional barriers. The temple art of the Calukyas shows a sharing of North and South Indian traditions, not a succumbing of one region to the power of another. And as the joint possession of Dravidian linguistic patterns, in Tamil and Kannada, and of Hinduism demonstrates a unifying sharing of common cultural roots among South India's regions, so the sharing of iconographic conceptions shows a sharing not a domination of one regional subculture or substyle by another.84 Early Calukya art is the oldest tradition of any extent surviving in Karnataka. It is from the beginning cast in a fully developed style, recognizable as a variety of the refined temple 84 In order to keep from making this analysis too unwieldy we have omitted distinguishing the Calukya's Andhra, non-Karnatak, style as fully as we might have. 338</page><page sequence="53">art known throughout India. It displays a local version of structural, decorative and narrative patterns seen elsewhere; it is an autonomous regional substyle. The earliest architecture is largely in the Drdvida (Southern) variety of the pan-Indian tradition, but the Northern variety is known too.85 Most significantly, it is in a variation of the Drdvida style that is earlier than any surviving Pallava Drdvida, distinctly different than the Pallava's regional variety of Drdvida, and in no way traceable to it. Calukya imagery of the Great Goddess is as characteristically regional as it is Indian. It is an autonomous local development of imagery shared with the rest of India, that has more in common with other, nearby Southern regional substyles than with the more distant Northern regional substyles. There are all-India traditions and styles. They are synthetic macrostyles, defined by a looser sharing of characteristics than the more homogeneous regional substyles. The substyles generally conform to the linguistic areas that define the most basic regions of social communication. But they overlap and interpenetrate more freely. They are cultural, not genetic. They are the result of conscious assemblage not racial inheritance. Their expressions share features in varying degrees, the more local the more consistent. The Calukya style shares both Northern and Southern macrostyle characteristics at most of their major sites in Andhra and Karndtaka. But we can identify Telanigana (Andhra) and Karnatak regional substyles, and specific site styles within these. They are not different branches off self-generated trees of style, but local collections. Their unity is thus inclusive, not exclusive. Mahisdsuramardini, the Great Goddess who slays the demon with the buffalo's form, is a pan-Indian concept with regional and historic variations that can be traced to no single or even predominant root. No equivalent exists in the Indo-European traditions outside of India. And there is no mention of Mahisdsuramardini within the extensive record of the Sanskrit tradition of India before she emerges in two brief passages of the Mahadb- harata.86 So the imagery of the Goddess's war with Mahisdsura and the demon's eventual succumbing to her is an Indian conception. The earliest texts we have, like the earliest surviving sculpture, show a variety that denies the suggestion of any single source. The conception is in each case a synthesis of related, yet different, elements. There is no Sanskrit association of Durgd (the Impassable) MahisdsuramardinI with the title "Victorious," associated with Korravai, the Goddess identified with Mahisdsuramar- dini in the earliest Tamil literature to survive, in the Sanigam poetry and the slightly later Silappadigaram. Both of these traditions are related to the imagery we find in the Deccan art of the Early Calukyas. No literature in the Kannada language of the Calukya region survives from earlier than the century after the Calukya's collapse, though a record of its writers and works exists.87 85 Tartakov (i980). 86 Mahabharata, IV,6 and VI,23. 87 See Nripatunga's Kaviradjamarga. Earlier writing in Kannada is known in inscriptions, going back to the Halmidi inscription of the fifth century or those of the Early Calukyas. 339</page><page sequence="54">There is no reason to suppose that either the Sanskrit or Tamil tradition of Mahisdsura- mardini is drawn from the other. Rather it seems clear that both are drawn from related pools of tradition. Both, for instance, are related by referring to the buffalo and to self-mutilating blood sacrifice. But where the Devi Mdhdtmya goes on for chapters to explain in detail the origin of the Goddess as the chief of all beings, and the progress of her battle with the Buffalo Demon, it gives only passing reference to self-mutilation. Two devotees seeking a vision of the Goddess are said to have "offered bdli, sprinkled with blood taken from their own bodies".88 By contrast the Silappadigaram refers to Korravai mainly as the patron of hunters and only obliquely to her slaying of the buffalo. It devotes greater interest to the offering of sacrifices, up to and including head sacrifices of the kind we have seen illustrated, as worshippers ask her to "Accept the blood that flows from our severed young heads, the price of a victory you granted to the powerful and valiant Eiyanars", and so on.89 It also describes, as the Devi Mdhdtmya does not, the Goddess "standing on the black head of a wild buffalo", and her association with the stag as well as the lion.9? A rich and complex imagery of Mahisasuramardini has come down to us from the sixth to eighth century in Tamilnad, Karndtaka, and Andhra, the three great language regions of South India. By comparing the Calukya images, of Karndtaka and southern Andhra, with the Pallava images, of northern Tamilnad, we can see both a sharing and a diversity of these traditions. If we were to expand our survey to all of the sub-continent the area of sharing would grow as would the range of diversity. Between the sixth and eighth century the Calukyas and Pallavas share some peculiar South Indian aspects of this pan-Indian tradition, such as nearly exclusive use of the Victorious Durgd imagery of the erect Goddess upon the buffalo's severed head and of the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery of the slaughter of the demon armies. Each also maintains its peculiar regional imagery, not shared between them. The Pallava Sirhhavdhini Durgd is an example of this on the one side; the anthropomorphic representation of Mahisa being slain by the Goddess is an example on the other. The first Early Calukya Mahisdsuramardini images are of two sorts. The Rdvana Phadi type (Fig. 11i), with the Goddess bending the zoomorphic beast's neck back, as it stands on all four feet, is known commonly throughout North India at this time. The Badami Cave I type (Fig. 17), where she holds the beast up off the ground by its tail or rear leg, though fairly popular in the Deccan, was fading from interest in the North at this time. The composite form of Mahisasura (e.g., Fig. I) is known in the North though few examples exist. All three forms, however, can be found on the Paraiuramaivara Temple of Bhuvanesvar, in that region's characteristic south Orissan version of the Northern style. What this reveals is the autonomous regional nature of Indian style, in which local variations on pan-Indian themes continue within traditions of local production. This autonomous local production is connected to pan-Indian traditions by incorporating their 88 Devi Mdhatmya, XIII.8. 89 Shilappadikaram, p. 8 3. 9o Shilappadikaram, pp. 8o-81. 340</page><page sequence="55">logic. It is not outside of those traditions, borrowing from them; it is their authentic expression. The iilpin of Aihole or Kanci were not dependent upon foreign models for specific inspiration. They were trained in local versions of the universal traditions. This view contrasts with the dependent-creativity suggested when anything North Indian in flavor is supposed to derive from Gupta, or anything of the Gupta tradition to derive from Mathuri.91 Or in our specific case, when what is Southern is attributed to the influence of Tamilnad. Dependent-creativity supposes that creativity is a rare phenomenon occurring only in a few independent centers, and mimicked more or less successfully throughout the rest of a dependent hinterland. It aligns well with primitive influence theory and diffusionism in general, explaining variations on common themes as copies of works from the great centers, or the result of artists traveling out from one of these centers. All three lack conceptions of culture as something belonging to all members of a commu- nity and capable of production in many places. As academic knowledge of India's art has developed over the years an ever greater number of autonomously creative artistic centers have been recognized. With this has come increasing sensitivity to the complex interaction among these centers. Monuments of Tamilnad once bracketed together as Pallava are now apportioned among the Pallavas, Pandyas, Muttaraiyars and others. The temples of Mukhalingam, once categorized as "provincial Orissan", because of their likeness to the better known temples of Bhuvanes- var, are now being studied as an autonomous local Kalifiga style, with its own unique characteristics, sharing features and qualities with not only the monuments of Bhuvanesvar on the north, but of Bundelkhand on the west and Telangana Andhra to the south.92 When knowledge was most limited and analyses were largely imperial ones of depen- dence and diffusion, chronological priority dominated consideration. Logic was confined to statements such as Sesadri's, supposing Besnagar the source of the Victorious Durga imagery of the South: "If the figure [our Fig. 28] is pre-Pallava, then, the interesting fact emerges that this provided the model for sculptures of the same type from Mamal- lapuram".93 As our understanding grows, however, and as we take into account the vast amount of imagery in perishable materials, we recognize that chronological priority in the record of survival may often be a misleading clue to actual priority of production. The discovery of a third to fourth century Victorious Durga at Sannatti is eloquent proof of this. But this discovery should not have been necessary for us to expect earlier examples in the South. Noting priority in the existing record is a basic tool in developing historical understanding of a body of material. But we should not confuse the survival record with the production it represents, or forget that its representation is a rough one. As our understanding advances and we grow more capable of grasping the complexity and depth of the field of traditions in any region or community, the ability of local traditions to develop coherent variations on common cultural themes becomes an in- 91 E.G., an otherwise quite successful book, Joanna Williams, Art of Gupta India (Princeton, I982). 92 Michael W. Meister and M. A. Dhaky, eds., Encyclopedia of Indian Temple Architecture, South India, Lower Drdvidadela 20oo B.C.-A.D. 124 (New Delhi, 1983); and Mary F. Linda, dissertation in progress, University of California, Berkeley. 93 Seshadri (1963), caption of pl. 17. 341</page><page sequence="56">creasingly critical issue of consideration. Alongside the problem of judging how the record of survival reflects the actual record of production we must judge the even more difficult issue of how a tradition generates new variations on established themes. Crude depen- dence-analysis of the appearance of new motifs favors foreign intrusion as an explanation. New ideas are assumed to originate either from outside of a tradition or from the limited number of creative originators found only within the better documented traditions. And yet, since all traditions change over time, it must be recognized that variants are a natural outcome of all traditions, minor as well as major. So, to show a characteristic comes from the outside, it is necessary to show that the continual production of variations on themes within any cultural tradition would not produce the same results. Simultaneous or parallel develop- ment of relatively similar imagery within a shared cultural field is a more reasonable hypothesis than continual unique invention and diffusion from a single macro-creative source. The more we know of any tradition the more we are forced to this conclusion. Calukya and Pallava Styles We thus have two major alternatives for explaining the appearance of the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery at the Early Calukya site of Pattadakal. One, of dependent creativity, which would declare it a demonstration of Pallava influence on the Calukyas, because a closely similar piece predates it in the Pallava region. The other, of autonomous produc- tion within shared traditions, sees the opposite: a rare example of minor Pallava patterns intruding into a self-sufficient and essentially independent Calukya art. Analysis of the Mahisdsura sainyavadha reliefs reveals a remarkable closeness between the Mahabalipuram and Pattadakal designs. But consideration of the place of each work within its own tradition reveals that the features of the design that connect them most particularly are not significant characteristics of either tradition. They can neither be drawn out of the Pallava tradition nor seen to be adopted by the Early Calukyas. Comparison of the full range MahddevI imageries in the two traditions reveals distin- guishable patterns of regional sharing and independence typical of the Indian language and cultural patterns in general. Both traditions fit together within an all-India context as Dravidian, South Indian. At the same time they are distinguished from each other as independent variations of the Southern style, as autonomous Southern styles. The Victorious Goddess exists in the Dravidian-language South: Karn.taka, Andhra, and Tamilnad. But it is in fact more frequently met with the closer we approach the Tamil region. Influence theory, with its emphasis on a few culturally creative centers and centralized diffusion of motifs, interprets this pattern as the spread of a genetic possession. The form is supposed to belong to its identifiable creators, the Pallavas, and to be legitimately inherited by other Tamil-speakers. Outside of Tamilnad it is seen as "borrow- ed" by people who somehow have less authentic legitimacy in its use. Or it is called the result of the "influence", of Tamil culture on these people. (Though the idea of legitimacy may seem at first out of place here, it is implicit in the terms of the discussion. We do not see references to C6!a uses of the Victorious Goddess as "Pallava borrowings" or "Pallava- influenced," though these are no less that, than Calukya or Gafiga uses would be, unless 342</page><page sequence="57">legitimate genetic inheritance is at issue.) In the same way, the self-mutilating devotees, and the Mahisdsura sainyavadha imagery may be said to be Dravidian in character, and then associated more familiarly with Tamilnad. A cultural rather than biological analysis of the distinct Dravidian traditions, as historically developing language-regional wholes, reveals a more complex pattern that comprehends both chronological evidence and regional variations more fully and cogently. It reads each of these motifs as Drdvida (Southern), but none of them as Tamil. In each case rather than the transmission of a single motif from one great center to other (subordinate) centers, we have a phenomenon better explained as shared traditions emerg- ing more popularly in one region than another. Self-mutilation can be seen depicted much earlier at Mathurd and the Victorious Goddess earlier in Karn.taka than in Tamilnad, where they eventually find their most extensive expression. The composite Mahisdsura, who stars in the Mahisdsura sainyavadha, is seen earlier in Karn.taka. But far more important, each pattern occurs in a regionally distinct form. Each region has major Goddess imagery that does not have parallels in the other region, and for the two forms that occur in both we have distinct Pallava and Calukya versions. Recognizing the language-regional contexts of the Calukyas and the Pallavas we see that a simple southern whole does not exist, and that the divisions among the various Dravidian regions are as important as the Sanskrit/Dravidian one in explaining Dravidian regional cultural developments. The Calukya imagery of Mahddevi shares the conventions familiar in North India much more than Tamil imagery does. Influence-theory can attribute such sharing - as Herman Goetz does in the passage quoted above - to the Calukyas being influenced by both Northern and further-Southern traditions. This is the most common approach available in our art historical literature. But only an approach that is more sensitive to the autonomous nature of the internal cultural development of local regions can explain the existence of the Victorious Goddess at Besnagar and Sannatti before it emerges in the Pallava record, or its appearance in local styles and iconographic variations. It also does a better job of explaining the continuing Karnatak use of this imagery in a peculiarly Karnatak version of the theme. The Drdvida unity we find in the shared themes is not the consistent unity of a single developing tradition, such as we see in the Pallava development of the Sirthhvahini, or the Calukya's anthropomorphic Mahisa. Rather, it is a regular incorporation of common themes within otherwise autonomous imagery. We see it in the appearance of the God- dess's stag and self-mutilating devotees with an otherwise Northern style Mahisisuramar- dini at the Virfipaksa, or the use by both of the Victorious Durga, and of the Mahisisura sainyavadha, which seldom occur anywhere else. It is a cultural unity of shared interests, not an inherited dependence on a single source. Far from being the passive receptors of other traditions the Early Calukyas - who have left us nearly a hundred fifty stone temples, created over a period of two centuries - were producers of a consistent and richly varied style, or set of styles, that was thoroughly their own. If some of that imagery traces to roots in earlier Northern and Southern traditions, of Maharistra and Mathuri, Kanci and Banavasi, it does so not through passive copying, but by selective incorporation and adaptation of models found in those traditions and filtered through generations of inter- 343</page><page sequence="58">mediaries. Their freedom from Tamil, Pallava influence as a root source for the creation of their Mahddevi imagery is an example of this independence. Like the Kannada and Telugu languages that express the verbal traditions of Karnatak and Telarigana or Andhra culture, the visual imagery of the Calukyas is an autonomous Dravidian system essentially distinct from that other major Dravidian cultural system of the time, the visual imagery of the Tamil-speaking Pallavas. The fact that we retain a more extensive and longer historical record of Tamil does not detract from the independence of Karnatak traditions at their emergence into the surviving record. Nor does the more southern location of the Tamilnad demonstrate a necessary priority or centrality in the place of its tradition among the other Dravidian traditions. Kannada is not an offshoot from Tamil but a distinct language, traceable with Tamil to roots that separated as long ago as the middle of the first millenium before the common era.94 Located further from the North than the Calukyas, and separated by them and other Deccan powers from direct contact with it, the Pallavas were less directly affected by North Indian visual traditions. But there is no reason to suppose that Calukya traditions, for all of their obvious sharing of North Indian traditions, were less essentially Dravidian. Karnatak art, and so Calukya art, was only less exclusively Dravidian, less purely Dravi- dian. Where Pallava art is in Drdvida styles only, the Calukyas sponsored art in the Drdvida style, the Northern style, in explicit mixtures of the two and in local styles that seem to transcend both. Their Dravidian style was no less essentially Dravidian than the Pallava's. Our experience of sculptural style and iconography throughout the Early Calukya remains is quite well represented by the evidence of this specific case. For all of the "influence" that various scholars have continued to cite, we find little evidence in the sculpture to support the suggestion that the local Karnatak traditions were anything but well developed local cultural inheritance and essentially resistant to the introduction of foreign iconographic subjects or stylistic traits. There have been suggestions that significant aspects of important Early Calukya monuments have been re-cut under Pallava direction and inspiration,9s or that Pallava artists were imported to work on Calukya monuments.96 Though we have not considered this issue specifically here, we may say that we see no evidence to support such claims.97 No work in a clearly non-Calukya, Pallava style in the Early Calukya region is known to us. Nor do we find any resonantly Pallava, non-Calukya iconography. The usual arguments for Pallava influence over Calukya cultural traditions have come in the analysis of architectural rather than figurative imagery. In this case also detailed study of the evidence has revealed distinctly different Calukya and Pallava substyles of a 94 George L. Hart III, The Poems of Ancient Tamil (Berkeley, 1975), P- 76, discusses the splitting of Kannada and Tamil from a supposed Proto-South Dravidian, and accepts a date of 400oo to 3oo00 B.C. E. for it. It is possible to accept this explanation by divergence, if it includes a significant element of convergence as well. 9s E.g., Herman Goetz, as quoted above (see note 81), or Aschwin Lippe, "Some Sculptural Motifs on Early Calukya Temples," Artibus Asiae, vol. XXIX (1967), pp. 5-24. 96 Since Cousens' cautious suggestion (i926), see note 8 above, this has been repeated and embroidered upon by a great many authors, e.g., most recently when "architects and workmen (are) removed bodily from Kanci to Pattadakal during warfare." 97 See Tarr (1969), p. 178, for a discussion of this in terms of sculpture. 344</page><page sequence="59">shared Dravidian style. These are cultural relatives not branches of a single tree or descendents of a common ancestor. They are not genetic, but cultural relatives. Their users were independent, local practitioners of autonomous varieties of mutually shared tradi- tions.98 The diminutive Calukya Mahisisura sainyavadha panel in the Mallikdrjuna temple must be viewed as an isolated instance of an inconsequential Pallava intrusion. 98 See Tartakov (i980), pp. 96-99, for a discussion in terms of architecture. 345</page></plain_text>
