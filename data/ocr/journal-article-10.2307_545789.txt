This two-volume report presents the re- sults from four seasons of excavating the pre- historic levels. After a brief foreword in which Akkermans presents the radiocarbon evidence for the absolute chronology, the reader is treated to discussions of settlement patterns in an evolv- ing landscape (T. J. Wilkinson), the stratigraphy and sequence of architecture (Marc Verhoeven and Peter Kranendonk), the pottery (Marie Le Mikre and Olivier Nieuwenhuyse), the chipped stone (Lorraine Copeland), the seals and sealings (Kim Duistermaat), the figurines (Pieter Collet), the groundstone and other small finds (Collet and Richard Spoor), the fauna (Chiara Cavallo), and the botanical remains (Willem van Zeist and Willemina Waterbolk-van Rooijen). In per- haps its only serious failing, the report lacks an integrating or concluding statement. As a field report, these volumes greatly complement Ak- kermans's recent approach to the Halaf of the Balikh area and more fully document recent articles on the Neolithic village.' The volumes report material that will long be central both to future study of basic culture history of the region and to understanding the origins of administra- tive control. The sequence of eleven levels falls into three major phases, distinguished mainly by pottery; interestingly, the chipped stone shows strong ty- pological and technological continuities across the ceramic phasing. The pre-Halaf phase (Levels 11-7) appears in limited exposures, with very little associated architecture. The pottery assem- blages reveal ties to the west, with significant amounts of Dark Faced Burnished Ware appear- ing alongside most of the chaff-tempered buff wares. Scant radiocarbon evidence places Level 11 around 5700/5600 B.c. and Levels 8-6 around 5200-5100 B.c., with a gap of several centuries between Levels 11 and 10. Significant exposures of architecture first appear with the brief transi- tional phase (Levels 6-4), which Akkermans dates to 5200/5150-5100 B.c. The Level 6 "Burnt Village," revealed in an 800 sq. m area, presents a dense agglomeration of buildings with rows of small square rooms, courtyards, and work spaces and several tholoi. Rooms often lacked doorways or were equipped with porthole doors in the walls; the frequent small piles of grain and concentrated remains of pottery or basketry containers indicates that many were storage rooms. The architecture of the later two Transitional levels presents a much more open fabric, with larger rooms and more widely spaced structures. In the Transitional pottery assem- blages, several new fine wares appear alongside the older wares, at first rather hesitantly and then with growing abundance. These new fine wares typically have painted (or combined painted and incised) decorations that strongly resemble Sa- marran wares, perhaps forming a western variant of the Samarran style (p. 173).2 Le Mikre indi- cates that the decorative style gradually shifts to- ward the Early Halaf tradition of the overlying levels. A similar process of stylistic emergence seems to have been occurring in the Sinjar area, where Stuart Campbell has traced the emergence of Halaf painted pottery from a Hassuna ante- cedent. At the beginning of the Early Halaf phase (Levels 3-1, dated 5100-5000 B.C.),3 the ex- posed architecture centered on a massively built multiroomed structure with niched walls and associated tholoi and other outbuildings. Once again, the architecture exposed in the later two levels reveals a trend toward more open and less heavily built structures. Halaf fine ware came 1A report of the earlier seasons may be found in P. M. M. G.

The issue is more than termi- nological, since it can prejudice archaeological expec- tations of social organization and can also induce a certain confusion of discourse. 3 Akkermans prefers to use uncalibrated dates; cur- rent assessments begin the Halaf around 5500 B.c.

Prehistoric Sabi Abyad holds many points of great interest, the most remarkable of which argu- ably is the early evidence for oversight of trans- actions with a system of sealings. Duistermaat's presentation of the glyptic makes for fascinating reading. The excavation has produced 300 seal- ings from the Level 6 "Burnt Village" and an- other seven from Level 3. Duistermaat includes in his presentation plain-jar stoppers (i.e., clay plugs with the morphological evidence of a seal- ing function on the reverse but lacking a seal im- pression) and sealing fragments that may once have borne impressions. The inconsistent han- dling of these pieces, 63 percent of the total, in- troduces some confusion to the otherwise lucid presentation. The sealings bear imprints from an impressive variety of stamp seals. Caprids account for nearly 20 percent of the sealings; already present at Bouqras, this motif would become common in later Halaf and CUbaid sites of northern Mesopotamia. Other motifs are geo- metric and occasionally abstractly figurative in nature, and the seals themselves may take vari- ous forms (round, rectangular, S- or Z-shaped, anthropomorphic). Duistermaat calculates that the sealings represent the use of at least sixty- seven different seals, many of which bear ex- tremely strong resemblance to each other, perhaps marking similar authority or corporate identity rather than personal identity. While many seal- ings bear multiple impressions of the same seal, only a few bear impressions of two different seals; most examples of the latter practice pre- sent the same combinations of motif types. The Level 6 sealings are concentrated in a few rooms-four rooms in two buildings account for 92 percent of the total, with 68 percent of the sealings occurring in Room 6 of Building II alone. The richness of accompanying small finds, especially in Room 6 of Building II (clay discs, tokens, figurines, miniature vessels, and the like), suggests storage and routine archiving of administrative records. The individual motifs are also differently distributed, with the caprid motif appearing only in Building II. The sealed object can be identified in 243 cases-Duistermaat dis- tinguishes eighteen techniques of sealing basket containers (112 examples) and pots (93 cases), as well as stone vessels, matting, and leather and cloth bags. Unlike later practices, no sealings from door locks appear in the collection. Where measurable, the sealed baskets and pots were fairly small (in both cases, the mouth diameter generally did not exceed 20 cm). Based on the straw and grain impressions visible on the re- verse of many sealings, Duistermaat suggests (p. 351) that cereals were commonly sealed com- modities and that other foodstuffs and luxury goods might also have been supervised in this way. Interestingly, the sealings on baskets were normally impressed, whereas those on pots (in- cluding the jar stoppers) were most often not im- pressed; this contrast probably signals divergent administrative routines for different goods. This glyptic evidence for surveillance and control challenges expectations about the nature of late Neolithic societies and the social contexts in which bureaucratic oversight took root. Ak- kermans elsewhere draws a convincing portrait of nonhierarchical Halaf societies founded on households and kin groups, possessing weakly developed specialization and lacking public in- stitutions, with integration achieved by mecha- nisms such as prestation, exchange, and marriage alliances that linked groups practicing somewhat different mixes of subsistence strategies.4 The uneven distributions at Sabi Abyad of sealings, sealing types, and sealing motifs argue for a de- gree of focused control-a relatively small num- ber of people monitoring transactions of different if overlapping ranges-seemingly at variance with a weakly hierarchical social organization. Duistermaat argues that these transactions reflect movement of goods from outside the village (pos- sible mechanisms including exclusive exchange relationships, differential gifting or "tribute- paying," or redistribution networks), under the assumption that intravillage transactions would 4 Akkermans, Villages of the Steppe. Earlier claims of simple chiefdoms (for example, S. LeBlanc and P J. Watson, "A Comparative Statistical Analysis of Painted Pottery from Seven Halafian Sites," Paldorient 1 (1973): 117-33) have since largely been withdrawn (for example, Watson and LeBlanc, Girikihaciyan: A Halafian Site in Southeastern Turkey [Los Angeles, 1990]).</page><page sequence="4">OCTOBER 2000 BOOK REVIEWS 289 not require a formal system of monitoring. Intra- village competition between constituent lineage segments or other corporate bodies, however, might engender careful accounting of transac- tions; this alternative would favor a "corporate" over an "individual" signification of sealing. The promised sourcing study of the clays used for the sealings (p. 374) will provide data essential to clarifying this issue. At this point, the intensity of glyptic activity of the Burnt Village at Transitional Sabi Abyad can be matched only in the Burnt Building at Ar- pachiyah and at Khirbet Derak, both half a mil- lennium later. While future excavation will no doubt produce comparable evidence for the in- tervening centuries, the evidence now suggests that sealing activity was sporadic during the Halaf period and not deeply ingrained in the po- litical economy of the Halaf world. Interestingly, the documented flashes of this activity occur at times of stress and change, with the formation of the Halaf configuration and immediately before the transition to the northern CUbaid.s The appar- ently heightened use of seal technology during these stressful times may mark several different possible responses, including risk-spreading, in- tensified competitive prestation, and struggle for control over resources. In this event, the use of glyptic technology to monitor transactions may have long remained a latent potential, activated only intermittently, before it developed into a bu- reaucratic routine during the late fifth and fourth millennia B.C. CHRISTOPHER EDENS University of Pennsylvania 5 In the Balikh, a fine-grained sequence allows Akkermans (Villages of the Steppe) to infer a detailed settlement history for that region, in which the Tran- sitional occurred at the end of steady settlement and population deterioration across the sixth millennium B.C., after which settlement complexity and regional population size increased again. Akkermans's data show a second settlement collapse at the end of the Halaf. Simultaneously, the settlement pattern cycled between two- and one-tiered hierarchies (Akkermans suggests, unconvincingly, a three-tiered hierarchy in several periods). The sources of these cycles and stresses remain unclear and surely constitute an impor- tant research area for the future.</page></plain_text>
