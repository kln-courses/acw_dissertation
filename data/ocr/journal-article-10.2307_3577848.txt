GINEVAN, Versar, Incorporated DAVID HOEL, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH GEOFFREY HOWE, National Cancer Institute Canada DON PIERCE, Oregon State University JEROME PUSKIN, Environmental Protection Agency ELAINE RON, National Cancer Institute, NIH The ninth American Statistical Association Conference on Radiation and Health was held in Copper Mountain, Colorado, July 8-12, 1990. This year marks the 10th anni- versary of the first conference. The series has grown to in- clude scientists from 10 countries (Australia, Belgium, Can- ada, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, UK, U.S.A., and USSR) and many disciplines (including statistics, epidemi- ology, radiation biology, health physics, and genetics). This year's conference, closely following the publication of the NAS BEIR report and Martin Gardner's article on leukemia in the children of nuclear workers, was an oppor- tunity to review our current state of knowledge about radia- tion risks and to identify areas in which more work is needed or is in progress. These areas include the following issues of particular public health importance: * The effects of chronic environmental or occupational exposures to low levels of low- and high-LET radiation; * The effects of environmental or accidental contamina- tion by various internally incorporated radionuclides; and * The possible modifying effects of genetic predisposi- tions. A number of ongoing large, multinational studies which will contribute to our knowledge in these areas were de- scribed. Subjects in these studies are persons exposed as a result of the Chernobyl accident, workers in the nuclear industry, persons receiving residential exposures to radon, and patients treated for cancer. The extended abstracts which follow provide an excellent summary of the Conference proceedings. The aim of most of these studies is to estimate low-level risks associated with low-level exposures. Uncertainties in exposure and dose as- sessment, in disease outcome, and in definition of popula- tions at risk, as well as potential confounding effects of other environmental exposure, may all seriously affect the adequacy of risk estimates which will result from these stud- ies. The new and ongoing efforts described at this meeting, generating new data bases for risk assessment and techno- logical improvements for dosimetry and risk projection models, will greatly improve our ability to assess small risks. We are confident that some of the questions remaining (after 50 years of studying ionizing radiation) will be an- swered in the next 5 years. The open and innovative ex- change among scientists which characterized this meeting will make an important contribution to this process. In par- ticular, new findings on the effects of low-level exposures, while they may disturb our collective beliefs, must be con- sidered seriously: the new theory we reject outright today may be the truth in the year 2000. 0033-7587/90 $3.00 336 Copyright ? 1990 by Academic Press, Inc.

SEYMOUR JABLON, National Cancer Institute, NIH. The BEIR V report (1990) was prepared by a committee chaired by Arthur C. Upton and is the latest in a series issued by the National Re- search Council/National Academy of Sciences. Although the title of the series is "Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation," the report emphasizes the carcinogenic effects of low-LET radiation, with the greatest emphasis on gamma radiation as it affected the atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The BEIR V report takes advantage of (1) estimates of individual radiation doses based on a greatly revised dosimetry system, DS86, and (2) follow-up data through 1985, or 11 additional years of data not available to the authors of BEIR III. The emphasis on carcinogenic effects can be measured in terms of the number of pages: 217 pages, or 55% of the text, while 70 pages are concerned with genetic effects, with only 20 pages covering fertility, cataracts, effects on the fetal brain, among others, and another 20 pages summarize the effects of radiography, fallout, occupa- tional exposures, high natural background, and residence near nuclear installations. In the 1950s there was as much, or more, interest in the genetic effects of radiation as there was in the somatic effects. Nevertheless, the difficulties in obtaining estimates of genetic risk for man have been very great and, despite the use of ever more probing methods including examination of individual gene products in thousands of irradiated parents and their off- spring, still, the best that can be done from currently available human data is to put a lower limit on the genetic "doubling dose" for man. The com- mittee adopted a value of 1 Sv (100 rem) as an estimated 95% lower limit for the human doubling dose and applied that value to estimates of the genetic burden of disease and of the proportion of that burden that results from mutation, to arrive at estimates of the number of additional cases per million live born offspring per generation per rem. It is evident that, based on a 95% lower confidence limit for the human doubling dose, extrapo- lated values from mouse data and estimates of the burden of genetic dis- ease in man and of the proportion of the burden resulting from new muta- tions, the resulting estimates are anything but precise. Some of those esti- mates include, for the first generation, Autosomal dominant Additional cases per 106 liveborn Severe 5-20 Mild 1-15 Recessive &lt;1 Congenital abnormalities 10 While radiation carcinogenesis has been a primary focus of interest, other effects cannot be overlooked. They include not only genetic effects but also effects on the lens of the eye, on fertility, and on the growth and development of children. A generalized effect that can be called "acceler- ated aging" has not, however, been demonstrated. The estimates of the risks of induced cancer have inspired much ques- tioning and even controversy because they are rather larger than the risks estimated by BEIR III in a report just 10 years earlier. Most of the estimates were, in both cases, based on the data from Japan, but for some kinds of cancer other substantial data sets were used, either in place of or in addi- tion to the data from the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) in Hiroshima. The estimates were, however, obtained in a very different way from the earlier estimates, using a computer program called AMFIT that provides a flexible way of fitting additive or multiplicative models to cohort data of the kind that RERF generates. The use of AMFIT enabled the fitting of models linear or linear-quadratic in dose that varied with age at exposure, with time from exposure, and with sex. All of the models fitted are relative risk models, and only for leukemia was there a significant term of the second degree in dose so, as in BEIR III, the preferred leukemia model is linear-quadratic but for other radiation-induced cancers, the BEIR V model is simply linear. The models themselves are presented and also the implications for population exposures to a single exposure of 0.1 Sv, lifetime exposure to 1 mSv/y, and continuous exposure to 10 mSv/y from ages 18 to 65. Specific models are presented for: leukemia mortality (Life Span Study data from RERF), cancer except leukemia mortality (RERF), breast cancer mortality (RERF and Canadian TB fluoroscopy data) and incidence (RERF, Massachusetts TB fluoroscopy and New York postpar- tum mastitis series), digestive system cancer mortality (RERF), respiratory system cancer mortality (RERF), cancer other than leukemia, breast, digestive, or respiratory mortality (RERF). Allowance for the latent period was made by excluding the first 5 years of follow-up for breast cancer and 10 years for other nonleukemia cancers. For leukemia, since data for the first 5 years after exposure were unavail- able, the problem was how to estimate effects in the period 2 to 5 years. Because the RERF data and the new dosimetry system have not allowed estimation of the relative effectiveness of neutrons, a constant value of 20 was used. Investigation of the accuracy of cause of death statements on certificates showed that errors were especially numerous for deaths at advanced ages, so deaths at ages more than 75 were excluded from the fitting. Further- more, since the leukemia response showed a downturn above estimated doses of 4 Gy, all data purporting to be associated with such doses were excluded. This exclusion maximized the estimated risks at low doses. Comparison of the mortality risks from a single exposure as estimated by BEIR III and BEIR V show that the new estimates are three to four times the previous values. The large increase derives in part from the revised dosimetry system, especially the fact that the neutron flux was apparently greatly overestimated by the T65D system, in part from the projection of risks to advanced ages where data had no opportunity to affect the esti- mates. The final estimate for lifetime cancer mortality in a standard U.S. population of 100,000 persons is about 1000 excess deaths following a dose, to each organ, of 0.1 Sv. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radi- ation has also recently published a report, UNSCEAR 88, which uses some- what different modeling, but the same data base for carcinogenesis and, as might be guessed, derives risk estimates not very different from those of BEIR V. DISCUSSION SARAH DARBY, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, University of Oxford The members of the BEIR V Committee deserve congratulations for their thorough and imaginative approach to estimating the health effects of exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation. Innovative aspects of the re- port that especially stand out are the detailed model fitting of the Japanese</page><page sequence="3">338 ABSTRACTS A-bomb survivors and the assessment of uncertainty in the point estimates of lifetime risk. One aspect of the BEIR V report that I find somewhat puzzling is the use by the Committee, as by its predecessor BEIR IV, of the excess lifetime risk (ELR) as the measure of lifetime detriment. The ELR from cause C follow- ing exposure is the increase in an individual's lifetime risk of dying from cause C as a result of the exposure. Although easy to interpret, it has several undesirable properties. These include: 1. Individuals whose cause of death is unchanged by exposure, but whose death is brought forward in time, make no contribution to the ELR, although they die prematurely and may experience substantial life-shor- tening. 2. As a result of (1), the upper bound for the ELR is { 1 - (lifetime risk of dying from cause C in the absence of exposure)). This seems artificial; one would naturally expect the upper bound for such a quantity to be 1. 3. The ELR can be negative for some causes of death even if they are positively related to exposure. This can happen when the exposure-in- duced increase in the death rate of some other cause is sufficiently large. 4. The ELR for all causes of death combined is zero. This seems quite unreasonable intuitively. It is also highly inconvenient as, in many cases, it is desirable to have a measure of the overall detriment due to an exposure, rather than to give detriment for a few specific causes of death. The ELR is not the only measure of lifetime detriment available, and other measures that avoid these undesirable properties exist. I would urge the next BEIR Committee to review the options thoroughly before making a choice. An Overview of Environmental Transport Models. F. OWEN HoFF- MAN AND STEVEN M. BARTELL, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831-6036. Environmental transport models play an important role in estimating the exposure of natural populations of organisms, including humans. These models attempt to represent quantitatively the physical, chemical, and biological processes that move chemicals from a source to a receptor. The models may be mathematically simple in form, for example, multi- plicative equations that employ concentration ratios representing the rela- tionships between food chain compartments at equilibrium, or more com- plex, such as with so-called "dynamic models" that consist of sets of cou- pled differential equations each describing the time-dependent behavior of specific transport processes (1). Despite the extent of complexity, the pre- dictions of these models are inherently uncertain. Uncertainty is affected by limitations in available data, necessary compromises in the conceptual formulation of the model, and judgment required for proper interpretation of the assessment scenario in which the model is applied (2-4). Recognizing the inherent uncertainty associated with the use of environ- mental transport models, we have found that their application in exposure assessment is best conducted in an iterative process. The first applications will be in a screening mode. In this mode, estimates of exposure are inten- tionally biased to produce results that are not likely either to underestimate (conservative screening) or to overestimate (nonconservative screening) actual events. Conservative screening is useful for identifying contami- nants and exposure pathways that are clearly below some specified level of concern; conversely, nonconservative screening will highlight those con- taminants and pathways that clearly exceed levels of concern. Screening calculations are intended to be applied with only limited knowledge of site-specific conditions, but their results will be most useful to justify data collection and model improvement needs for intensified efforts to produce more realistic exposure assessments of specific contaminants (2, 5). The next iteration of model application is in a "realistic mode." This mode attempts to remove all sources of bias to produce a "best estimate" prediction. However, because of the potential for over- or underestimation of actual exposures, we have found it essential to estimate formally the uncertainty associated with this mode of prediction. Monte Carlo simula- tion has proven to be an effective tool for examining the propagation of uncertainties through transport models, although for very simple equa- tions algebraic error propagation methods may be sufficient (2, 4, 6, 7). In the realistic assessment mode, probability distributions are assigned to each parameter in the model that is associated with uncertainty. If bias is suspected due to possible structural deficiencies in the model, alternative model structures are investigated and/or additional terms are inserted to represent this source of uncertainty. Because of data limitations, judgment must be employed to ensure that the probability distributions assigned to each uncertain model parameter will encompass possible values for that parameter (2). For assessments where the quantity to be predicted is an unknown value, the results are the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval about a best estimate prediction and a ranking of the most important model pro- cesses that affect the width of this interval. For assessments where the quantity to be predicted is an unknown distribution of values, the results are upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval about a best estimate distribution. In this latter case, the ranking of important model processes will change depending on the location within the best estimate distribution that is of interest (2, 7). If the confidence bounds infringe on exposure limits of concern, there is immediate incentive to acquire additional information on those processes contributing most to the width of these bounds. As this information is acquired, further iterations of the "realistic" assessment mode are con- ducted until either the confidence bounds are clearly distinct from the exposure limits or the bounds are reduced to a range that is essentially irreducible. Irreducible confidence bounds imply irreducible uncertainty. Irreducible uncertainty is attained when the time required for acquisition of new data exceeds the time frame in which decisions must be made regarding the need for action. As the result of 10 years of experience using Monte Carlo techniques with environmental transport models (1-8), we have developed some gen- eral rules of thumb. These rules touch on: (a) sample size and computa- tional demands of Monte Carlo analyses, (b) the impacts of selecting differ- ent distribution types for uncertain parameters, (c) the ability to use expert judgment to specify parameter distributions and correlations between pa- rameters, (d) parameter ranking as a guide for considering the effect of correlations among parameters, and (e) calibration using results from model validation studies. Finally, exposure estimation is only one portion of the overall process of risk assessment. Many of the techniques used to estimate uncertainty in exposure predictions need to be applied to the entire suite of equations ranging from source term quantification to internal and external dosime- tery and the translation of exposure to risk. In all cases, statistical distribu- tions specified for uncertain model parameters should represent confi- dence about possible values that may be realized for a specific assessment scenario. In the absence of data, these distributions must be obtained using judgment. The ability to apply judgment in the absence of data means that subjective confidence estimates can be obtained for any risk assessment situation requiring a quantitative result. REFERENCES 1. F. O.

Although radiation exposures in the nuclear industry have been assessed much more precisely than exposure to most other occupational carcino- gens, the accuracy and precision of individual dose estimates is a function of time, place, radiation quality, the geometry of the radiation source and the exposed worker, as well as the placement of the dosimeter on the body of the worker. In the IARC international collaborative study of cancer risk among workers in the nuclear industry [(1), see also Cardis, this confer- ence], a descriptive study of dosimetric practices in each facility in the study is being carried out by a small committee' consisting of experts in dosimetry and in epidemiology familiar with the cohorts included in the study. The aim of the study is to identify potential sources of biases and uncertainties in dosimetry in an attempt to quantify the errors in recorded dose estimates and take them into account in the statistical analyses of cancer risk. A questionnaire requesting information on dosimeter design and dose assessment methodology, as well as monitoring and recording practices in each facility over time, is being used as the basis for this study. It is supple- mented by information from historical documents describing radiation protection requirements in individual facilities, by dosimeter intercompar- ison studies, and by consultations with experts in individual facilities. The sources of biases and errors which have been identified so far are reviewed below. Some of these are also discussed in a recent report of the US National Academy of Sciences on dosimetry for participants in atmo- spheric nuclear weapons tests (2). Quantification of uncertainties is being attempted only for workers with doses predominantly from high-energy photons. (1) Photons exceeding 100 keV. Exposure to external penetrating radia- tion (X and -y rays) appears to have been measured fairly precisely, and in a comparable fashion, since the 1960s. Before that, estimates of exposure were subject to much greater uncertainty, because of the relatively high threshold values and poor precision of the older dosimeters, and because of the practices used for recording exposure in the case of missing dosimeters or below-threshold readings (3). Adjustments for these recording practices will be made on an individual basis, when appropriate, based respectively on the number of missing dosimeters in a given year and the recorded doses before and after the period for which the dosimeter was missing, and the fraction of subthreshold measurements in a given year and the distribu- tion of dose levels in the cohort of interest during the same period. Studies of temporal changes in the distribution of recorded doses in individual facilities will be helpful in assessing the magnitude of biases and errors in dose estimates associated with the use of different dosimeters. Uncertainties introduced by differences in the method of dosimeter cali- bration at the different facilities are also a source of concern, particularly at low dose levels, as are the geometry of the exposure and hence the spacial relationship of the dosimeter to the wearer and the source of exposure. Calibration has generally been done in a consistent fashion over time in individual facilities (for example, calibration on a wooden block in Cana- dian facilities and in air in the US; G. Cowper and J. Fix, personal commu- nications). For photons of 100 keV or more the bias associated with these practices can be quantified (2). Corrections for the geometry of exposure will be carried out, when appropriate, on the basis of typical "average" geometries in various parts of the facilities in the study, on a study of angular responses of different types of dosimeters, and on the conversion factors for different geometries proposed by the International Commission for Radiological Protection [ICRP, (4)]. Recorded dose estimates were meant to estimate different quantities over time, varying from exposure, measured in Roentgens, to deep dose (absorbed energy I cm below the skin), recorded in rem or millisieverts. One of the main tasks in combining exposure data across time and facili- ties is to ensure, as far as possible, the comparability of these estimates. In most facilities, the recorded estimates for exposures to photons of 100 keV or more, the predominant exposure, are actually equivalent to deep dose; in the others, conversion factors will be provided. The ICRP (4) conver- sion factors will also be used, on the basis of energy ranges (of 100 keV or more) in specific parts of facilities, to estimate organ doses. Interlaboratory differences in chemical processing, reading, and inter- pretation of films may further increase the uncertainty of dose estimates in a way which is difficult to quantify. (2) Exposure to radiations oflower energies and internal contamination. The uncertainties in estimating actual deep or organ dose from recorded external dose in persons substantially exposed to low-energy radiations, for example, plutonium X rays, or contaminated with various radionuclides are much greater than for workers for whom the predominant exposure was external radiations of higher energy. A possible exception is those workers exposed to the intake of tritiated water who are monitored by an adequate urinalysis program. At this time, those workers will be identified from employment and monitoring records and may be excluded from some statistical analyses of cancer risk. No attempt to estimate their deep doses or organ doses will be made. Discussion. The statistical and epidemiological literature abound in dis- cussions of the effects of systematic biases and random errors on estimates of exposure effects. Very generally, one can summarize this literature by stating that no-differential random misclassification will tend to bias the measures of risk toward the null (the hypothesis that the exposure has no effect on the response) and may distort the shape of the dose response, and that systematic biases have a wide range of consequences depending on the magnitude and direction of each individual bias. Available records will not always provide the information which would be ideally required to standardize recorded dose estimates. Having identi- fied the sources of uncertainty, however, an attempt will be made to quan- tify them and take them into account in the statistical analyses of cancer risk according to occupational radiation exposure. It is clear that conver- sion factors used for taking into account known biases can do so only in an "average" fashion. "Subjective confidence intervals," defined in the Na- tional Academy of Sciences report (2) as confidence intervals "based on a 'Committee members: IARC, E. Cardis, J. Esteve, J. Kaldor; Canada, G. Cowper, G. Howe; UK, L. Salmon, V. Beral; US, J. Fix, E. Gilbert.</page><page sequence="5">340 ABSTRACTS careful assessment by experts of many individual sources of uncertainty," will also be derived. In epidemiological studies of radiation-induced risk, quantification of uncertainty in dose estimates had been relatively neglected until the DS86 revision of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki dosimetry (5). Since then, more methodological attention has been given to quantifying uncertainties in dose estimates for each subject and taking account of them in statistical analyses of risk [(2, 5, 6), and Thomas, this conference]. The application of similar methods to take into account the time- and dose-related uncertain- ties in recorded dose estimates will be an important part of the analyses of the data from the international study of cancer risk among workers in the nuclear industry.

Problems in Reconstructing Medical Exposures. ELAINE RON, Radia- tion Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. In comparison to occupational or environmental exposures, estimating radiation doses following medical exposures is thought to be relatively accurate because some level of documentation often exists, i.e., primary treatment record, summary of radiotherapy, or follow-up notes. But even when complete radiation therapy records are obtained, not all of the data needed for dosimetry are always available and, therefore, assumption-la- den calculations are frequently made. Radiation doses for medical expo- sures can be calculated by making direct patient measurements during treatment, by conducting dosimetric experiments on anthropomorphic or water phantoms simulating exposure conditions, by extrapolating from experimental results to situations different from those measured on the phantom, and/or by using Monte Carlo techniques. Recently, biologic markers are also being considered as potential dosimeters. This paper will focus on some of the problems encountered in trying to reconstruct doses following several types of medical exposures. Problems in accurately estimating individual organ doses result from uncertainties in treatment techniques, patient characteristics, dosimetry methods, and concepts of radiobiology. Much of the requisite radiotherapy data is found in patients' records (e.g., machine type, radiation energy, field size), but often information on treatment technique and recording notation (e.g., field orientation, shielding, patient position) is not known. For example, patients with enlarged tonsils often were treated with X rays using rectangular fields, however, there was rarely any mention of whether the short side was vertical or horizontal. In an extreme situation (10 x 15- cm field), the typical thyroid dose could change from 500 to 70 cGy, whereas for the usual field size (8 x 10 cm) the change could be from about 70 to 35 cGy (M. Stovall, personal communication). Another example is based on tuberculosis patients exposed to repeated fluoroscopic chest ex- aminations (1). These patients at times faced the X-ray tube and at other times had their back to the tube, but individual patient orientation was not known. On the basis of questionnaire information from both patients and physicians, it was assumed that 25% of the exams were done with patients facing the tube and 75% with patients' back to the machine. The authors calculated that if all patients had actually faced the X-ray tube for all exams then the breast cancer risk estimate would have been 1.7/106 WY-cGy; however, if all women had their back to the tube the risk would have been 51.5/106 WY-cGy--a 30-fold difference. When treatment techniques are highly stylized, i.e., they are very specific and are always performed in the same manner, variability among patients and institutions is reduced. One population for which doses have been measured extensively con- sists of patients treated with scalp irradiation for tinea capitis. Independent dosimetry experiments were conducted at three institutions, and in each assumptions regarding shape and size of the head, skull thickness, and patient positioning were made. The estimated average thyroid dose per treatment was fairly similar (2-4). Intrastudy variation was relatively minor when several measurements (assuming the same machine and filtra- tion qualities) were made for the thyroid gland, but there was large varia- tion when estimating the dose to the parotid gland (5). These findings suggest that the dose reaching the parotid was more sensitive to changes in head and shielding positioning than was the dose to the thyroid. This may be explained by the fact that the parotid gland is in close proximity to the lateral radiation fields, so that any slippage in the shield may have brought it into the direct beam, whereas the thyroid gland is outside the beam (5). The possibility of patient movement during treatment has been mea- sured in some studies. Pottern et al. (6) found that a I-cm change in dis- tance from the thyroid gland during treatment for enlarged tonsils resulted in a difference in the dose estimate of ?30%. Slight changes in head or shielding placement during treatment for tinea capitis caused a 50% in- crease in average thyroid dose resulting in an excess relative risk per cGy of 0.27 instead of 0.41 (7, 8). Individual patients vary remarkably due to age, sex, or physical attri- butes, and these differences in external and internal structure influence absorbed dose. Patient size is frequently not considered as a variable in dose estimation, but in a study of cervical cancer patients, Stovall et al. (9) calculated that the absorbed dose to organs far from the pelvis would be incorrectly estimated by approximately +20% for patients exceptionally tall or short, and that extremes in anteroposterior patient diameter could introduce errors of about 25%. It has also been shown that errors in organ doses due to patient size increase with increasing distance from the pri- mary beam (10). But since doses decrease rapidly with distance, their con- tribution toward the neoplastic effects of radiation is relatively small. In estimating doses to endometrial cancer patients, patient diameter would be particularly crucial because being overweight is associated with the dis- ease (10). To accurately estimate thyroid doses following exposure to diagnostic '31I, thyroid weight, as well as isotope activity, and 24-h uptake, must be known. However, from a 10% sample of a Swedish cohort of patients examined with 13I, the estimated mean thyroid size was 20% larger when based on scintiscan results than when based on palpation. This uncertainty in organ size would effect calculation of the risk coefficient (11, 12). To estimate absorbed tissue doses for cervical cancer patients treated with orthovoltage X-rays, Stovall et al. (9) used three measurement meth- ods. When they compared measurements from an Alderson phantom, a water phantom, and Monte Carlo calculations to the selected value, they found that the ovary estimates, which are in the primary beam, agreed</page><page sequence="6">ABSTRACTS 341 within ?7%. For organs near the beam, such as the kidneys, pancreas, and stomach, the maximum disagreement was 40%. For organs far from the beam (e.g., brain, thyroid, lung, breast, salivary gland), the maximum dis- agreement was 55%. Most of the disagreement appeared to be due to differ- ences in the phantoms used in the three dosimetry methods. Finally, concepts of radiation biology have to be incorporated into deci- sions regarding the method for computing total or average radiation doses, and maybe more importantly, these concepts have to be considered in the interpretation of the data. The most simple type of problem is illustrated by a study of TB patients who received repeated fluoroscopic chest exami- nations. Boice et al. (1) calculated the average breast dose by adding to- gether the dose to the left and right breast and dividing by two, but as the authors pointed out, the validity of this approach is based on an assump- tion that the breast are evenly irradiated, and that breast tissue is uniformly radiosensitive. A more complicated problem involves computing average or total active bone marrow dose in relation to leukemia risk. To calculate the average dose to total active bone marrow following treatment for cervi- cal cancer, an average dose was estimated to 14 anatomic sites. The dose to each anatomic site was multiplied by the proportion of active bone marrow at that site and then these weighted doses were summed (13). Since 27% of the bone marrow is in the pelvis, which received an average of about 2000 cGy from external beam and brachytherapy, and 19% of the marrow is in the ribs and sternum, which received only 40 cGy, assump- tions about cell-killing effects, the homogeneity of the dose distribution, and movement of stem cells will influence quantifying radiation risks. Another example of the influence of radiation biology concerns the ef- fect of protracted exposures, by either having multiple or fractionated treatments. Multiple treatments frequently involve years between expo- sure, whereas fractionated treatments most often occur within a few days. In animals, protracted exposures have been shown to decrease, but also to sometimes increase tumorigenic potential (14). Protraction could reduce the frequency of cancer by allowing time for sublethal cellular lesions, or alternatively, it could increase tumor frequency because the reduced cell killing leaves more transformable cells. Multiple treatments have been handled differently by various investiga- tors, but most frequently the exposures are simply added together. Approxi- mately 10% of the Israeli children treated with scalp irradiation for tinea capitis had multiple treatments, separated by at least 1 year (8). Yet, in the analysis, time between treatments was not considered, and the dose from each treatment was summed to give one total dose. Since only the date for the first treatment was recorded when the data were originally abstracted, time between exposure and tumor diagnosis could be calculated only from the first treatment. Using a different approach, Smith and Doll (15) and Darby et al. (16) restricted their analyses of ankylosing spondylitis patients to those having only one treatment. Shore et al. (17) attempted to grapple with fractionation effects in a cohort of approximately 2500 patients who received 1-11 fractions of X rays, usually within a few days, as therapy for enlarged thymus glands. Taking into account the number of fractions, dose per fraction, and inter- val between fractions, they were unable to find any significant evidence for a sparing effect of fractionation. In summary, dose reconstruction for medical exposures often requires a great deal of information regarding the specifics of the radiotherapy, accu- rate measurement and calculation techniques, and assumptions concern- ing patient characteristics, but also an understanding of radiation biology and its relevance to fundamental mechanisms of cancer development. Since even the most careful and sophisticated post-exposure estimates are subject to several sources of uncertainties, more statistical methods for handling errors in exposure estimates are needed.

DISCUSSION JEROME PUSKIN, Environmental Protection Agency These were four excellent papers on the subject of radiation exposure and dose estimation. Dr. Bartell provided an overview of exposure model- ing, including the treatment of uncertainties. Dr. James discussed the new</page><page sequence="7">342 ABSTRACTS ICRP lung dosimetry model and new work on the modeling of radon daughter dosimetry in the lung. Drs. Cardis and Ron discussed problems of dose estimation in the context of epidemiological studies of people irra- diated occupationally and medically. I would like to focus on the issue of uncertainty in exposure and dose assessment, and address this issue as it relates to regulatory activities at EPA. Usually, for decision-makers, the two most important end points of a risk assessment are estimates of (1) the Maximum Individual Risk (MIR) and (2) the total number of cancers (or cancer deaths) induced by an environmental release. The latter are often weighed against costs of pro- posed regulatory controls in a cost-benefit analysis. Policies which limit the MIR may, however, lead to actions more stringent than would seem warranted by a cost-benefit analysis alone. The precise concept of MIR varies within EPA, but it is meant to repre- sent a reasonable upper bound on lifetime risk. In our office, the MIR is defined as the excess lifetime risk of a cancer (or cancer fatality) for an individual living his/her whole life at the location of maximum exposure. The individual is assumed to be average with respect to other factors, including sensitivity to the pollutant, diet, etc. Some argue that the MIR should be calculated using an average residence time of 6 or 7 years and that the variability in residence time should be treated as part of the uncer- tainty. However, this approach is likely to understate the maximum risk unless one takes into account the possible higher sensitivity of children to radiation and the longer residency times for some nearby inhabitants. This example also illustrates the possible confusion between concepts of vari- ability and uncertainty. Dr. Bartell outlined two distinct approaches to treating uncertainty when deriving model projections of exposure (or other end points such as dose or risk). In the first, each model parameter is assigned a specific value-generally, a "best" or somewhat "conservative" estimate. These parameters are propagated through the models to obtain an estimate of the exposure (dose, risk). An uncertainty analysis is performed subsequently by assigning upper and lower bounds to the most significant parameters and repeating the calculations employing these extreme values. In the sec- ond (Monte Carlo) approach, each parameter is assigned a probability distribution at the outset, which is randomly sampled along with the distri- butions for other parameters. The exposure (dose, risk) estimate is then the average exposure (dose, risk) found by propagating many repeated sam- plings of the parameter sets through the model. The procedure yields a probability distribution for the end point; uncertainty bounds fall out of the calculation automatically. The Monte Carlo procedure is preferable from a theoretical standpoint, and we expect to make increasing use of it as a method for quantifying overall uncertainty. Nevertheless, it poses a number of problems: (1) it can be cumbersome and time consuming to implement; (2) complexity can obscure significant sources of uncertainty; and (3) it is difficult to commu- nicate results to decision-makers. Regulatory agencies will therefore proba- bly continue to rely heavily on less elaborate approaches to uncertainty analysis. The main value of uncertainty analysis for us, at present, is to identify the major sources of uncertainty, their relative magnitudes, and their con- tribution to overall uncertainty. With this knowledge, attention and re- sources can be better directed to improve our risk assessments. A good uncertainty analysis improves the credibility of an analysis; however, the estimated magnitude of the uncertainties alone does not usually strongly influence decision-making. Uncertainties in dose estimates are often poorly specified. Risk assessors and regulators rely mostly on the ICRP for dosimetry models that estimate organ doses for a given exposure pathway and radionuclide. The ICRP does not provide any uncertainty bounds on its dose estimates. Indeed the models are not always constructed with enough biological realism to facili- tate an uncertainty analysis. The models are meant to give a single dose estimate for use in regulating occupational exposures. Thus the models are not intended to address the age dependence of the dose, which is important in the environmental context. Dr. James spoke about the proposed new ICRP lung model. One interest- ing feature of that model is the much lower weight assigned to doses to the alveolar region of the lung than those in the current ICRP model. Few human lung cancers originate in this region, and we have no evidence that cancers arise from radiation doses to the alveoli. This change could affect regulatory limits on airborne emissions of radionuclides inhaled into the lung as particulates. This problem is just one example of a major uncer- tainty in risk assessments relating to internally deposited a emitters. Often, the dose from these emitters is distributed very nonuniformly within an organ, and it is difficult to estimate the dose to target cells. Other examples are in estimating doses to endosteal or marrow cells from a-emitting bone seekers and to sensitive cells in the GI tract from ingested radon. Floor discussion. In connection with Dr. Cardis' talk, someone noted a recent Russian report of a near doubling of cancer rates among workers in a Soviet weapons material processing plant. Many of these workers re- ceived doses over 1 Gy in a single year; some received over 4 Gy. Also cited was an incident in which large amounts of radioactive material from this facility were released into a river, causing anemia in people ingesting the polluted water. Biodosimetry for Human Exposure to Ionizing Radiation and Its Po- tential in Health Risk Analysis. RONALD H. JENSEN, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There now exist seven different analytical techniques for measuring gen- otoxic responses that occur in humans when they are exposed to ionizing radiation. Each assay has weaknesses and strengths, but in combination, the assays should display complementarity, allowing more complete de- scriptions of dose absorbed and the potential for pathological effects from that dose. The classical technique for biodosimetric analysis is to scan manually microscope slides of specially prepared peripheral lymphocytes to deter- mine the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (1). The greatest difficulty with this elegant technique is the labor intensity and tedium of performing aberration frequency analysis. In general, chromosomal spreads show such complex image patterns that analysis of one sample often requires several person-days and still lacks in sufficient data for strong statistical signifi- cance. To improve on ease of performance, a new cytogenetic technique (called FISHT) has been developed. It uses chromosome-specific recombinant DNA probes to label specific chromosomes in metaphase spreads. This technique fluorescently labels the DNA from specific chromosomes so that translocations between the labeled chromosome and any other chromo- some are easily detected. Rapid scanning fluorescent microscopy can then be performed to obtain sufficient precision to detect very low frequencies of translocations (2). Although this technique does not usually result in as detailed a chromosomal description as conventional banding analysis, the increased speed and precision make it an important addition. An assay for the frequency of micronuclei in lymphocytes was devel- oped to detect the formation of these extra, small pieces of nuclei in cells that have been clastogenically altered by radiation (3). This assay, per- formed on thymocytes, uses colorimetric staining to enhance the detect- ability of nuclei by conventional manual microscopic analysis. The other four biological dosimeters are designed to detect somatic cell mutations. Each assay is identified by an acronym that specifies the protein in which mutations are determined: HPRT assay, GPA assay, Hb assay, and HLA assay [for a review of these assays, see Ref. (4)]. All four assays are designed to detect or select mutated cells by the phenotype of the protein that is signified by their titles. HPRT detects the inactivation ofan enzyme in thymocytes by adding a toxic DNA substrate that is incorpo- rated as a lethal event into all cells that retain the enzyme (which is the normal, unmutated phenotype of thymocytes). The GPA assay detects mutated erythrocytes by labeling cells with monoclonal antibodies to the two different forms of this cell surface antigen. Cells that bind only one of the two antibodies are progeny of mutant erythroid precursor cells and are enumerated by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. The HLA assay also</page><page sequence="8">ABSTRACTS 343 uses monoclonal antibodies to a cell surface antigen, but the detection scheme is to kill selectively the cells that express the antigen. Thus, as in the GPA assay, mutant cells are those that have lost the normal antigen. Fi- nally, the Hb assay measures a single substitution mutation in the hemoglo- bin of individual erythrocytes using antibody detection of the mutated hemoglobin and automated fluorescence microscopic analysis. All of the above assays have been shown to display a dose response for exposure of humans to ionizing radiation, with differing amounts of pub- lished data for each. There are clear indications that some of these assays (GPS, chromosome translocations, and FISHT) will provide lifetime bio- dosimetry for exposure with some complications due to differing suscepti- bility factors among individuals and sensitivity to chemically induced gen- otoxicity. Measurements by other assays (HPRT, chromosomal dicentrics, micronuclei) were shown to be possible only for short times after exposure (a few years at most). The GPA assay is the most easily performed of the seven assays, with the micronucleus assay next, since it requires microscopic detection of rela- tively easily identified morphological changes. The HPRT and HLA assays are the next fastest, although they require cell growth and selection, which are slow but not labor-intensive processes. The Hb assay and the FISHT cytogenetic assay are somewhat slower because they require fluorescence microscopy, which is a relatively slow procedure. Conventional cytoge- netic assay by chromosome banding is the most labor intensive of the set. Because the amount and type of information obtained by each of the assays are somewhat different, the best assay to use depends on the purpose of the study. However, the best approach would be to use several of the assays in a multi-end point analysis. Each of the assays has different analyti- cal means for detecting biological effects. They are detecting different types of damage to DNA in different genes and on different chromosomes, and will certainly show differing sensitivity and precision. This combination of biodosimetric results could be obtained and compared with epidemiologi- cal analyses to determine whether they provide early detection of cancer risk due to genotoxic radiation damage. We researchers involved in biodosimetric analyses are very interested in collaborating with epidemiologists and statisticians who desire to estimate the genotoxic risk of human radiation exposure and will welcome any requests for such collaborations.

Until recently the main issue in radiation epidemiology concerned iden- tification of specific diseases, primarily cancers, for which there was evi- dence of increased mortality or morbidity associated with radiation expo- sure. As it has become clear that radiation exposure is associated with persistent, increased incidence for many cancers, interest has shifted from identifying diseases with increased incidence to describing patterns of risk over time and identifying factors which affect these risks. Our ability to study these more complex issues has been strengthened both by increases in the amount of data available and by improvements in statistical method- ology. The statistical advances most relevant to work in radiation epidemi- ology have resulted from the development of regression-based modeling procedures for the analysis of survival data and the theory of generalized linear models (1-3). In this presentation we describe some of the major questions in radiation epidemiology and indicate how mathematical models are being used to address these questions. Specific examples of the application of modern modeling methods to problems of radiation risk estimation are provided in several recent reports from RERF (4-9). These methods were also used extensively in the BEIR IV and BEIR V reports (10, 11) and in a recent report on thyroid cancer in the Israeli tinea study (12). Two general models for the instantaneous incidence rate (hazard) func- tion have proven useful in analyses of data on radiation risks. These mod- els are (1) the generalized additive relative risk model, X(t, z, d) = X0o(t, z)[l + y(d)E(t, z)] (1) and (2) the generalized additive excess risk model, X(t, z, d) = Xo(t, z) + ry(d)E(t, z), (2) where t is a vector containing attained age and other functions of time, z is a vector of additional covariates which does not contain functions of dose, and d is a vector of covariates describing exposure. The functions Xo( ), -y(d), E(.) describe the background rates, dose-response function, and dose-response effect modification, respectively. The factorization of the radiation risk into separate multiplicative components for dose response and effect modification, though often assumed, is not an essential feature of the models. These models generalize classical relative and absolute risk models since in both (1) and (2) the dose response can depend on time. Although specific models derived from (1) or (2) can be directly related to hypothesized mechanisms for radiation carcinogenesis, these models are more descriptive than mechanistic. Parameter estimation in risk regression models can be done using maxi- mum likelihood methods for grouped survival data or, in the case of rela- tive risk models, partial likelihood (Cox regression) methods for un- grouped data. AMFIT and the other regression programs in the EPICURE package (13) are useful tools in working with general risk models. Model-based parameter estimation and hypothesis testing can be used to address many issues in radiation epidemiology, including adjustment for background rates; low-dose extrapolation; shape of the dose response; dose-effect modification by factors such as age-at-exposure and sex; and temporal variation in risk. Although background rates are not a major concern in most analyses of radiation risks, they must be handled in some way when modeling radia- tion effects. Adjustments for background rates can be made by means of external comparisons (standardized incidence ratios) or internal compari- sons based upon stratification or parametric models. In parametric models the log of the background rate is typically modeled as a linear or linear- quadratic of log attained age with the coefficients depending on sex, birth cohort, and other relevant factors. Traditionally radiobiologists have made a major distinction between relative and absolute risk models. In recent years it has become clear that, even after allowance for a suitable latent period, the absolute risks for most cancers are not constant in time. There are suggestions that relative risks may vary with time for some solid tumors. Models like (1) and (2) can easily incorporate temporal variation in the excess risk. However, once risks are allowed to vary with time there is no real difference between relative and excess risk models. Thus the choice between these two models must be based upon issues such as parsimony or the goals of the analysis. Most interest in radiation effects on humans concerns the estimation of</page><page sequence="9">344 ABSTRACTS risks for low doses or low dose rates. However, the studies from which these estimates are derived generally involve relatively high doses and dose rates; thus extrapolation to doses and dose rates of interest in radiation protec- tion is important. Although these two types of extrapolation are often treated as a common problem, they are quite different. Most epidemio- logic studies of radiation effects involve a small range of dose rates, making it difficult to estimate dose-rate effectiveness from a single study. Attempts to estimate dose-rate effectiveness factors by comparing studies with differ- ent dose rates are complicated by confounding due to population differ- ences. The question of extrapolation can be addressed from within a single study. However, because the effects are small it is not possible to produce precise estimates of low-dose risks. The issues of shape of the dose response and RBE are closely related. In looking at the shape of the low-dose response, it is important, especially in the A-bomb survivor data, to remove high-dose effects which arise due to random errors in individual dose estimates or cell killing. Pierce and col- leagues have considered these issues in detail (7, 8). Estimation of RBEs is equivalent to estimation of the shape of the dose response for different types of radiation. If, as is the case in the atomic bomb survivors, people were exposed to both y rays and neutrons, dose-response function models of the form y(d) = (fl dg + 02d + P3dn) are often appropriate models for dealing with separate effects of -y and neutron radiation. Unfortunately, estimation of type-specific dose-re- sponse curves is difficult because of the high correlations between dose components in those studies in which people were exposed to various types of radiation. Dose-response effect modification by factors such as sex and age-at-ex- posure is often modeled using log linear functions of the covariates of interest. The choice of effect modifiers depends on whether one is inter- ested in relative or excess risk models. For example, for solid tumors, sex effects are generally larger in relative than in absolute risk models, while it is virtually always necessary to allow for temporal effects when working with absolute risk models. Age-at-exposure effects have been seen for most cancers associated with radiation. In looking at effect modification it is generally useful to consider models in which effect modifiers are treated as categorical variables, e.g., three to five age-at-exposure or time categories. Categorical variables help provide a better sense of what the excess looks like and help in checking the goodness-of-fit for smoother models. Assessing the goodness of fit of radiation risk models is difficult. De- viance-based global goodness-of-fit statistics are not adequate when work- ing with highly stratified data because of the small expected number of events (? 1) in most strata. The best approach is to make use of the models themselves to assess goodness of fit. This involves the formulation of mod- els to test for specific types of lack of fit or, as noted above, the use of categorical variables to examine how the observed values differ from the fitted values for a given model. Confidence intervals provide important information about specific parameters; however, it should be noted that the Wald intervals (estimate + standard error) can often be misleading. When possible it is suggested that confidence intervals be based on score statistics or likelihood ratio tests. With current software it is easy to fit a bewildering array of models. Indeed it is much easier to fit complex models than it is to understand and summarize them. It is not enough simply to fit a model and report its functional form. Plots provide a useful summary even though, because of the multivariate nature of the data, it is generally difficult to define the "data" to be plotted with the fitted curves. The use of suitably defined categorical variables can be useful here. Lifetime risk estimates can be a useful summary provided that the methods and assumptions are fully speci- fied. In working with lifetime risks more attention needs to be paid to uncertainties arising due to both parameter estimation and projection. The authors of BEIR V attempted to provide some measure of the uncertainty in their risk projections, but much work needs to be done to develop practi- cal approaches to this problem. In conclusion, although methods for modeling radiation-induced dis- ease incidence have developed rapidly over the last 10 to 15 years and we now have powerful tools which make it possible to fit a wide variety of absolute and excess risk models, much work is needed to improve how we use these tools. Statisticians involved in modeling radiation risks need to look more closely at how we can incorporate (and evaluate the relevance to human populations of) information from other areas of radiobiology and we need to work on the development of better ways to present and summa- rize what we are learning from our work.

Radiation Quality and Dose Rate: Modifying Factors of the Biologi- cal Effects of Radiation. DAVID J. BRENNER, Columbia University. The BEIR V report on the health effects of exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation (1) is notable for a 56-page introduction to radiobiologi- cal theory and practice which provides little or no input to the subsequent mathematical modeling of epidemiological data. In this note, we suggest</page><page sequence="10">ABSTRACTS 345 that basic radiobiological concepts should play a role in risk estimation based on exposed human cohorts, and we point out some of the pitfalls that may occur if this does not happen. For a given type of radiation delivered at a given dose rate, biological response correlates well with dose, i.e., energy absorbed per unit mass. However, the response can be considerably modified by the type of radia- tion to which the target is exposed, and also by the temporal pattern of the dose distribution. These two factors are by no means independent; for example, the effects of high-LET radiation on cell killing are less depen- dent on dose rate than those of low-LET radiation. Because of the small sizes of human cohorts available for the statistical evaluation of the effects of low levels of radiation, it is usual to pool results from different exposed groups which may have been exposed to different types of radiation and/or different dose fractionation regimes. Such a situa- tion is potentially problematic, because although radiobiological theory indicates that corrections need to be made for such effects, quantitative corrections are usually available only from in vitro or animal studies. Once risk estimates are made, further problems then arise if the estimates are to be applied in situations different from those pertaining to the original data sets. We illustrate these considerations by reference to a practical case, namely the generation of risk estimates for mortality from radiation-in- duced breast cancer. In the recent BEIR V report (1), these estimates were based on an analysis of two combined data sets: the Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors (2), and a subset of the Canadian Tu- berculosis Fluoroscopy (CAN-TB) study (3). In the LSS study, the incident radiation was primarily 3y rays, delivered essentially instantaneously; in the CAN-TB situation the incident radiation was ' 80 kVp X rays, delivered in an average of about 100 well-separated fractions. The effects of differing radiations. It has long been known that equal doses of different radiations may produce different biological effects. For the same dose, these different biological effects must be a consequence of the fact that the same energy is deposited in different patterns by one radiation compared to another. This is the field of microdosimetry, which is concerned with the distribution, d(y), of lineal energy (energy per unit path length, y) depositions within cell nuclei or smaller volumes. At low doses, such energy distribution patterns in individual cells deter- mine the relative biological effect. Such a situation follows if the initial lesion for cancer is related to energy deposition in a single cell, a notion supported by the monoclonal origin of many cancers. At low doses, the response, R, (per unit dose) of a biological system to a given radiation, i, can be written (4) Ri = ry)di(y)dy, where r(y) is the relative effect as a function of lineal energy. In other words, cells respond with a response function r(y) (independent of the radiation, but characteristic of the end point) to a range of energy deposi- tions d,(y) (independent of the end point but characteristic of the radia- tion) producing a total response Ri. The weighting function, r(y), has been calculated from in vitro data (4), and can be folded in with d(y) functions calculated for Hiroshima or Naga- saki radiation fields or 80 kVp X rays. The result (5) is that the predicted low-dose effectiveness of 80 kVp X rays is about 50% larger than that for 3 rays at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. This value is consistent with the measured (6) increased effectiveness (1.9 + 0.4 at 3 cGy) of orthovoltage X rays relative to y rays for in vitro oncogenic transformation. Thus the uncritical pooling of data from X-ray and y-ray exposures may be unwise. In fact, even lower-energy X rays ('- 28 kVp) are currently used in screen-film mammography, and they might be expected to be about twice as effective as y rays (5, 7), raising questions about the direct applica- tion of risk estimates based primarily on LSS data in the assessment of the risks of mammography. The effects ofdifferent dose rates. The CAN-TB data resulted from expo- sures divided into about 100 separate fractions. When there is enough time for complete repair of damage between fractions, if a small dose D is deliv- ered in 100 fractions, the effect, Eoo(D), is related to the effect of a single- fraction E,(D/100) as (8) Eloo(D) - 100E,(D/100). Thus the effect of fractionation will be to reduce the biological effect if E,(D) &gt; 100E1(D/100)-i.e., the acute dose-response relationship has a positive curvature-or to increase the biological effect if E,(D) &lt; 100EI(D/ 100)-i.e., negative curvature. There is considerable evidence from in vitro studies of oncogenic transformation that at low doses (i.e., &lt;1 Gy) the dose response has a negative curvature (9), and this is reflected in the observed (9) increase in transformation yields in fractionated regimes. In vitro, a sparing is usually observed after fractionated regimens, though no data are available at doses per fraction as low as those (-0.25 cGy) delivered in the CAN-TB exposures. Thus again it seems imprudent to use data from two different regimens (in this case acute exposure LSS and highly fractionated CAN-TB) without appropriate corrections which, unfortunately, are currently not well known or understood. In summary, it is clear that different radiations and different dose rates/ fractionation regimens will produce variations in biological effectiveness. The nature of these variations is moderately well understood in vitro, but less so in vivo. Thus, for example, the use of pooled data from different cohorts exposed to different radiation fields can be a dangerous procedure, and certainly not justifiable simply because the individual cohorts produce statistically insignificant differences. A corollary of the same consider- ations must raise doubts about the application of risk estimates to situa- tions where the dose is delivered in a different manner than pertained for the original data from which the risk estimate was made. It has been known for many years that radiobiologists can do a better job if exposed to a good dose of statistics/statisticians. Perhaps the reverse is also true. Acknowledgments.

DUNCAN C. THOMAS, University of Southern California. Radiation risk assessment involves consideration of dose-response rela- tionships allowing for the modifying effects of dose rate, age, sex, latency, LET, and interactions with other carcinogenic exposures. Many of these issues are to be addressed by other speakers at this conference. This talk will therefore try to address four issues: improved methods for analysis of nested case-control studies, mechanistic interpretation of the patterns seen by descriptive methods, approaches to allowing for measurement errors, and the role of unmeasured heterogeneity. Methods of analysis for nested case-control studies. The BEIR V model (1) for leukemia is based entirely on the Japanese data, which lack any information for the first 5 years after exposure, a period in which the rates are the highest in both the ankylosing spondylitis and cervical irradiation cohorts. Unfortunately, neither of these cohorts has any subjects exposed in childhood, when the relative risks are highest in the atomic bomb survi- vors. It is clear, therefore, that a definitive risk model for leukemia will require a pooling of these three studies. Dose comparisons for both the cervical and ankylosing spondylitis pa- tients are based on a nested case-control design. The problem with this design is that among the exposed cohort, there is not enough variation in dose for internal comparisons to be fully efficient. To remedy this prob- lem, we have developed an approach which combines the standard case- control dose comparisons with a comparison of the rates in the nesting cohort to predicted rates based on external rates and the dose distribution among controls (2); these two comparisons can be shown to contribute essentially independent information. For the cervical irradiation data, the combined-likelihood method was able to distinguish between alternative dose-response models and modifying effects of age and latency much bet- ter than either component alone. We hope to apply similar methods to the analysis of the ankylosing spondylitis data and combine the three data sets at a later date. Mechanistic models and methods of analysis. The BEIR V Committee spent quite a lot of time discussing radiobiological principles and how they might be used to guide the formation of a statistical model for analysis of the available data sets. In the process, several variants of the multistage and other models were fitted to the atomic bomb survivor data. In the end, however, we were unable to arrive at a consensus as to the underlying biology and felt that it would be premature to enshrine these vague notions in terms of a specific mathematical model. Very little remains from these discussions in the final report (1). In the interests of stimulating further work along these lines, I will describe some of what was done. Clearly, the descriptive patterns for leukemia are very different from most of the solid cancers. Lacking data on the full age and latency range for leukemia, it is probably premature to think about mechanistic modeling. The only effort that was made in this direction was to fit a simple lognor- mal latency model in which the "initiation" rates were assumed to be a linear-quadratic function of dose and the geometric mean of the latency distribution was allowed to depend on age and dose. This analysis showed a significant dependence of latency on age at exposure, but not on dose. For nonleukemias, baseline rates increase rapidly with attained age and the absolute excess rates increase with both age at exposure and time since exposure, each adjusted for the other. We attempted to explore these phe- nomena in the context of the Armitage-Doll multistage model of cancer (3). The simultaneous effect of both age at exposure and time since expo- sure suggests that radiation cannot act only at the first or penultimate stage of a multistage process, and both hypotheses were strongly rejected. If radiation acts only at a single stage, as suggested by the apparent absence of a quadratic component to the dose response, then the best fit was obtained by assuming it acted at the second of five stages. However, models in which radiation acted at both the first and third or the second and fourth stages fitted significantly better, and were essentially indistinguishable. In this model, the lack of a quadratic component can be explained by the fact that the exposure was instantaneous, whereas a quadratic component would be present for extended exposures. However, experimental data suggest the reverse pattern. If the quadratic component is interpreted as arising from independent lesions to DNA from separate quanta of radiation while the linear compo- nent arises from a single lesion (a "complete" lesion, an "initiating" lesion which requires later promotion, or a "promotion" of a previously initiated lesion), then one would expect that the two components might be modified by age at and time since exposure in different ways. A similar argument might apply to the neutron component. We attempted to test this hypothe- sis by fitting models of the form used in the BEIR V report, but with separate modifying terms for the linear-gamma (LG), quadratic-gamma (QG), and linear-neutron (LN) terms. The LN estimates were quite unsta- ble and were therefore pooled with the QG term. For leukemia, there was a significant difference for the age-at-exposure effect (negative for LG, posi- tive for QG/LN), whereas for nonleukemia, there was a significant differ- ence for time since exposure (positive for GL, negative for QG/LN). Accounting for exposure measurement error. It is well known that non- differential measurement error will bias a dose-response relationship to- ward the null. Recently there has been a series of papers that have discussed methods of correcting for this bias when the distribution of measurement errors is known. In the study of leukemia and exposure to radioactive fallout from the Nevada Test Site (4, 5), both point estimates and variances for each dose estimate were provided by the dosimetry system. Separate variance esti- mates allowed for uncertainties in the deposition rates and in residence histories. Standard parametric methods for correcting for measurement errors could not be used, because their assumptions of the normality of the true dose and measurement error distributions were clearly violated. In- stead, we developed a technique based on nonparametric density estima- tion and Gibbs sampling (6). The basic idea is to sample repeatedly a possible value of each subject's true dose from its posterior distribution, given the measured dose, disease status, and current estimates of the dose-response and dose distribution models. Because the dose distribution is modeled as a discrete mixing distribution with a small number of points of support, the posterior distri- bution is also discrete and is easily computed and sampled from. These imputed true doses are then used to refit the dose-response model and the parameters of that model are randomly sampled from their posterior dis- tribution for the next iteration. The parameters of the dose distribution model are also randomly sampled from their posterior distribution, given the imputed doses. In this way, random samples from the marginal distri- bution of the model parameters can be generated and tabulated. When applied to the leukemia fallout data, adjustment for these uncer- tainties increased both the median and the variance of the distribution of slope estimates, but only by at most 12%, even though the coefficients of variation of the individual dose estimates averaged over 30%. We conclude that the dose-response relationships have not been seriously affected by measurement error. Unmeasured heterogeneity. Remarkably little is known about the inter- action of radiation with other known risk factors (host factors or other agents), and variation with unmeasured risk factors is pure speculation. Aside from age and sex, about the only measured risk factor for which any data are available is smoking, and these data are far from conclusive. It appears that the joint effect is probably greater than additive, but may be less than multiplicative. Nevertheless, it is widely speculated that there</page><page sequence="12">ABSTRACTS 347 may be great heterogeneity between individuals in their susceptibility, per- haps due to genetic factors. Such heterogeneity could affect either their baseline risks or the slopes of their dose-response relationships (i.e., their radiosensitivity). Unfortunately, without some marker for susceptibility, the hypothesis is essentially untestable without making untestable assump- tions. For example, if one assumed a proportional hazards model, condi- tional on frailty, then the marginal hazards would not be proportional because of the "survival of the fittest"-the most frail subjects would fail first, leaving an increasingly fitter cohort at risk. The hypothesis of mar- ginal proportionality can be tested, but the assumption of conditional pro- portionality cannot. This would suggest that if the hypothesis is to be tested, it is essential to search for markers of susceptibility and to test whether they act by in- fluencing baseline risks or radiosensitivity. Clearly more data on measured host factors and joint effects on other agents would be useful, but so far this search has not been very rewarding. Biological markers of genetic sensitiv- ity may eventually prove to be powerful tools. In the meantime, an obvious approach to consider would be family studies. Many cancer sites show strong familial aggregation, but whether this reflects shared exposures, shared baseline risks, or shared sensitivities to environmental agents has not been explored. It appears that it would be feasible to conduct such a study within the cohort of atomic bomb survivors, and we are presently exploring the possibility. Statistical methods that could be used to test the various alternatives will be discussed. The implications of unmeasured heterogeneity for risk assessment are the source of some confusion. It is easily shown that, conditional on their measured doses, disease cases will not be representative of the population at risk with respect to unmeasured risk factors, modifiers, or even their true dose if it is measured inaccurately. Nevertheless, it does not follow that risk models ignoring this variability will lead to biased estimates of the average population risk, which is what is needed for most risk assessment purposes. Furthermore, even for individuals, it can be shown that the posterior ex- pectation of the probability of causation is simply the naive estimate ignor- ing heterogeneity, unless that heterogeneity is so extreme that there is a major shift in the survival distribution (7).

PIERCE, Oregon State University I congratulate the speakers for excellent presentations of very nice work. I know too little radiobiology to evaluate the provocative message of Dr. Brenner, but am glad that he has raised these points. Such communication is a major aim of this conference, and I hope that others will address these issues. My comments on Dr. Preston's paper are relevant to Dr. Brenner's point, since I will emphasize the inability to obtain needed results from statistical analysis alone. Not only did Dr. Preston make an elegant presentation of the statistical models and methods commonly used, but he has played a major role in developing these. He was too modest about the role of his program AM- FIT. I will make some critical comments about current trends in analysis of the RERF data, but these are not directed toward Dr. Preston's work. He is to blame only in that his powerful software makes it too easy to overdo the analyses. My concern is with tendencies to "overfit" the RERF cancer data, a longstanding problem that is becoming more critical with powerful statisti- cal tools. This is raised, in part, by the intricate models of the BEIR V report. However, such committees are charged with making very specific point estimates, tempered by indication of uncertainties, so my criticisms are really directed more generally. The committee did a good job with a very difficult assigned task. Dr. Preston noted that we have recently realized how to analyze jointly data on specific types or classes of cancers. I have done some preliminary analyses in this direction, using the publicly available RERF data as pro- vided to BEIR V. Their report considers models for three classes of cancers other than leukemia: respiratory, digestive, and "other." The models se- lected for these involve different general levels of risk, and different time patterns. As a first step I have jointly analyzed the data for these three nonleuke- mic classes, using the basic model of recent RERF reports: time-constant excess relative risk, depending upon sex and intervals of age-at-exposure. Fitting a model for which the effects of cancer type, sex, and age-at-expo- sure factorize, the ratio of risk for digestive to respiratory cancers is about 0.75, and the ratio of risk for "other" to respiratory cancers is about 0.60. However, the P value for these differences in risk level is about 0.6 (chi- square of 1.1 on 2 df). I am not contending that the differential risk esti- mates should simply not be used, but this makes clearer than the complex models how poorly estimated they are. The UNSCEAR-88 report gives risk estimates for much more specific cancers, which I find difficult to take at face value. It is one thing to say that we should not expect risks for different cancers to be the same, and another to rely strongly on very imprecise estimates. Going a step further, consider the emphasis in BEIR V on differential time trends in the excess relative risk. In this joint analysis I have fitted models where possibly different time trends are allowed for each of these three cancer types, modeled by BEIR V and in RERF reports. The P value for testing constant relative risk against three different time trends is about 0.25 (chi-square of 4 on 3 df). This is not surprising; only for respiratory cancer is there indication of decreasing relative risk, and the lack of statisti- cal significance of this was made clear in the BEIR V report. Their adop- tion of a model incorporating this may be defensible, in view of the time- decreasing risk for respiratory cancers in the data on ankylosing spondylitis patients. At least it was good to make clear that the RERF data are consis- tent with this decline.</page><page sequence="13">348 ABSTRACTS Thus the limitations of the data should not necessarily lead to adoption of very simple models, when there is clear reason to consider more com- plex ones. This arises again in regard to the shape of the dose-response curve, where it is arguable that BEIR V overemphasized the apparent lin- earity of the nonleukemia dose response. Although quite linear, these data are also statistically consistent with substantial upward curvature in the range 0-4 Sv; this has been investigated in recent RERF reports. Use of elaborate models may lead not only to exaggeration of differential effects, but even more importantly to lack of clarity in interpreting the data. The BEIR V models are in fact more intricate than those discussed above. It will be difficult to compare conclusions of committees which independently arrive at models as complex as those of BEIR V. The evolu- tion of risk estimates may be as important as their actual levels, and with- out care it may be difficult to compare the BEIR V and BEIR VI assess- ments. It is unfortunate that, due to complexity of models, excess lifetime risk estimates have emerged as the only "common denominator" for com- paring conclusions in various reports, for there are additional uncertainties and complexities in computing, or even in defining, excess lifetime risk. In regard to Dr. Thomas's presentation, I only have time to comment on the errors-in-doses work. He has made a remarkable achievement in find- ing a way to carry out an ambitious general approach suggested by David Clayton. However, I doubt that we would have adopted this rather com- plex scheme in our RERF work, had it been available, and I would like to sketch our simpler approach. I will write x for true dose, z for estimated dose, and y for a generic response variable. Where Dr. Thomas uses f(xl z, y) we choose to use f(x I z), the distribution of true dose among those with given estimated dose. It is noteworthy that he takes a Bayesian approach, avoiding much of the subtlety about the precise meaning of this at the individual level. The distributionf(x I z) can be approximated by estimating the marginal distri- bution f(x) and making assumptions about the error model f(z I x). It is very easy to confuse the meanings off(x I z) and f(z I x). Our approach for linear dose-response models was to regress y on E(x I z), the (estimated) mean true dose among those at given estimated dose z, i.e., the mean off(x I z). For the RERF cohort E(x I z)/z decreases substantially and nonlinearly from one, for large z, due to the extreme skewness of the distributionf(x) of true doses. Correcting for this is the key to reducing biases in linear risk estimates and reducing distortion in the apparent shape of the dose response. That is, one can reexpress a basic linear model, yi = a + Ox, + error,, as yj = a + #E(x z) + [x, - E(xlzi)] + errori, = a + OE(xlz,) + ui, where the error term ui comprises both the dose-estimation error and the basic sampling variation. The variance V(u,) of this combined error term is roughly 2 V(x zi) + V(error,), providing weights for the regression and assessment of standard errors of the estimates. For the RERF cancer data the first term in V(u,) is dominated by the second, so the usual weights can be used and the only required modification is replacement of zi by E(x I z,) in the dose-response analysis. This can be thought of as an approximation to the method suggested by Dr. Thomas, which seems satisfactory and more well-suited to the needs at RERF. Statistical Methods for Analyzing and Combining Data on Low Level Exposures to Ionizing Radiation. ETHEL S. GILBERT, Pacific Northwest Laboratories. Introduction. Occupational studies of workers who have been exposed to radiation provide a direct assessment of low-level radiation risks, and can serve as a check on estimates obtained through extrapolation from studies of populations exposed to high doses and dose rates. Several studies of workers involved in the production of both defense materials and nuclear power in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada are being con- ducted. If our current risk estimates are correct, these studies have very low power for detecting risks, but can be used to provide useful upper limits on risks. If, on the other hand, our current risk estimates are too low, the studies are adequate to detect large departures from these estimates. A broad assessment based on the totality of evidence from all occupa- tional studies is obviously desirable, and such an assessment can be best accomplished by analyzing combined data from all studies. Plans for inter- national combined analyses are underway, and combined analyses on a national scale are also being conducted. In the United States, results based on combined data on male workers at the Hanford Site, Oak Ridge Na- tional Laboratory (ORNL), and Rocky Flats Weapons Plant have been published (1, 2), and are used in this presentation to illustrate the applica- tion of various statistical procedures. Statistical methods. Because good exposure measurements are available, and because the amount of exposure varies considerably among workers, analyses based on internal comparisons of death rates by level of radiation exposure can be shown to be more powerful and less biased than analyses based on comparisons with external rates. Internally based comparisons have included tests for associations of radiation exposure and death rates from many different diseases, and have also included the calculation of risk estimates and confidence limits for comparison with estimates from other sources, such as those obtained from high-dose data. Analyses have been based on the assumption of a linear relative risk model in which the relative risk is assumed to be of the form I + OZ, where Z is a measure of exposure. A major reason for choosing a linear model is that it is desirable to be able to compare results with risk estimates from high-level studies, and these have been based primarily on linear models. Low-dose data are not adequate to distinguish among various models, but the linear relative risk model has proved a reasonable model for describing data from most high-level studies, and has been used extensively in recent analyses of data from these studies. The focus in this presentation is on risk estimation, but certain features of analyses apply to both testing and estimation. Most analyses have been based on cumulative dose, which changes as workers are followed through time, and thus cumulative dose needs to be treated as a time-dependent variable. To account for a possible latent period, cumulative dose has usually been lagged by various intervals; that is, dose received within some specified interval prior to the time at risk has not been included. Factors such as age, calendar year, and sex have been controlled through stratifica- tion, with age stratified in single-year intervals, thus serving as the time variable in a hazards model formulation. For analyses based on data from more than one facility, the source of the data has also been used as a stratification variable, and thus allows for the possibility that baseline risks might differ across facilities. Estimates of the excess relative risk, 0, have been obtained by maximiz- ing the likelihood. Confidence limits may be based on either the likelihood ratio statistic or the score statistic using expected information. Because of the very highly skewed exposure distributions and the small number of deaths from some causes of interest (leukemia, for example), asymptotic approximations may not be adequate. Confidence limits presented below were based on computer simulations using the score statistic, and therefore differ slightly from those presented in Gilbert et al. (1, 2), which were based on asymptotic approximations. Additional detail on statistical methods is given by Gilbert (3). Summary of results. Detailed results of the U.S. pooled analyses are present in Gilbert et al. (1). Here, only the risk estimates and confidence limits for leukemia and for all cancer except leukemia are discussed. The estimated excess relative risk coefficients for leukemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia) were negative when based on the Hanford data, the ORNL data, or the combined data, but positive when based on the Rocky Flats data. The 90% confidence limits included zero in all cases. The upper confidence limit based on the combined data was 2.8% per 10 mSv (1 rem), lower than for any of the individual studies, and also lower than the linear estimates of 5.2% per 10 mSv based on the A-bomb survivor data (4). For all cancer except leukemia, the estimated excess relative risk coeffi-</page><page sequence="14">ABSTRACTS 349 cients were negative for all three studies and for the combined data, but again the 90% confidence limits included zero in all cases. The upper confidence limit based on the combined data was 0.5% per 10 mSv, and was slightly larger than the linear estimate of 0.41% per 10 mSv based on the A-bomb survivor data. An important objective of these studies is to evaluate to what extent direct low-level results confirm results from high-level extrapolation. To do this precisely, there are additional issues that need to be considered. These issues are discussed below. Comparability with respect to time after exposure, age at exposure, and sex. Data on populations exposed at high levels indicate that the excess relative risk can depend fairly strongly on time after exposure, age at expo- sure, and sex. In comparing results based on low-level studies with esti- mates from A-bomb survivors, it is desirable to take such dependencies into account. For occupationally exposed populations, exposure occurs in adulthood and primarily to males (the U.S. combined analyses were re- stricted to males), while the A-bomb survivor study included all ages and both sexes. Most of the occupational exposure was received in the 1960s and 1970s, while the A-bomb survivor exposure was all received in 1945; thus time after exposure is shorter for the workers than for the A-bomb survivors. Data from studies based on low-level exposures are generally much too limited to permit direct investigation of modifying factors. However, it is possible to incorporate patterns of risk that have been identified in other studies in our analyses. This can be done by assuming that a specific risk model is correct, and expressing estimates and confidence limits as multi- ples of the risk expected under that model. This approach has been applied using the BEIR V (5) risk models, which incorporate dependencies on age at exposure, time after exposure, and sex. The approach also provides adjustment for different cancer types; separate models were provided for leukemia and breast, respiratory, digestive, and other cancers. Based on the combined data for all cancer except leukemia, the upper confidence limit was found to be about 1.75 times the risks predicted by the BEIR V models. The comparable ratio from the results presented above is 1.25. This difference is accounted for in part by the fact that A-bomb survivor relative risk estimates for males exposed in adult- hood tend to be smaller than for the overall population. BEIR V analyses indicated that leukemia risks depended on both age at exposure and time after exposure. Applying this model to the worker data resulted in almost no change in the ratio of the nuclear worker confidence limits and the high-dose results. However, the BEIR V leukemia model was based on linear-quadratic extrapolation, and this lowered the A-bomb survivor estimates by a factor of two. The ratio of the combined nuclear worker upper confidence limit to the BEIR V linear-quadratic estimate was about 1:1. Dosimetry. The doses used for the A-bomb survivor analyses, including the BEIR V analyses, were based on estimated dose to the bone marrow for leukemia, and estimated doses to specific organs for analyses involving other organs. For the workers, an evaluation of historical dosimetry prac- tices is currently underway, with emphasis on developing appropriate fac- tors for converting recorded doses to doses to various organs. These factors may vary by calendar year and by the type of work performed. A preliminary assessment of dosimetry suggests that the overall factor needed to convert recorded dose to bone marrow dose is about 0.7. If this adjustment factor is applied to the leukemia analyses, the ratio of the worker-based upper confidence limits is raised from 1.1 to 1.6. Dosimetry for cancers other than leukemia is more complex because of the many organs involved, but probably some adjustment of the previous compari- son is needed here as well. Random error in dose estimates can also lead to downward bias in risk estimates. Because many of the more important sources of error are corre- lated in various ways across workers and across years, an assessment that took account of random errors would be complex. Confounding factors. The potential presence of confounding factors is always a concern in epidemiologic studies. In the worker studies, those performing jobs involving radiation exposure may have different socioeco- nomic characteristics than workers performing other jobs. As part of the international combined analyses, we have used job category data for Han- ford workers to assign social class in a way that is fairly comparable to the British definition. Most of the workers with higher radiation exposures are found in social classes IV and III-manual. The relationship of both noncancer and cancer mortality with social class was examined. Noncancer mortality was found to be strongly related to social class, but cancer mortality did not show as clear a relationship. Nevertheless, we performed an analysis of radiation exposure and mortal- ity that included stratification on social class. For Hanford workers, this slightly lowered both the estimate and the upper confidence limit for all cancer except leukemia. Similar analyses, adjusting for several combinations of potentially con- founding factors including length of employment, initial employment year, and time since initial employment, have been conducted. In addi- tion, at Hanford, a lung cancer case-cohort study was conducted to investi- gate possible confounding by smoking (6). This study did not reveal any large differences in smoking habits by level of radiation exposure, and analyses of the association of lung cancer mortality and radiation exposure were not greatly affected by adjustment for smoking status.

Combined Analyses of Data on Nuclear Industry Workers. ELISABETH CARDIS, International Agency for Research on Cancer, France. A direct assessment of the carcinogenic risk associated with protracted low-level exposures would be useful in resolving the controversy about the adequacy of studies of acute high-dose exposures to ionizing radiation for the setting of environmental and occupational protection standards. Stud- ies of nuclear industry workers provide an important opportunity for ob- taining such information. Epidemiological studies of cancer risk among nuclear industry workers have been carried out in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada and cover close to 250,000 individuals. Dose estimates are avail- able for approximately half of them (see also Cardis, this conference). Ex- posure was predominantly to external radiation: to X and -y rays and some</page><page sequence="15">350 ABSTRACTS neutrons; internal contamination is known to have occurred for subgroups of workers. Only a small proportion of the workers have received doses substantially above background. The all-causes and all-cancer mortality of these workers are generally substantially lower than in the general popula- tion. There is, moreover, little evidence of an association between overall cancer mortality and level of radiation exposure, although the risk esti- mates derived from these studies are consistent with a range of possibilities from an absence of a radiation risk to a risk several times greater than that on which current radiation protection standards are based (Table I). In terms of site-specific cancer mortality, no clear pattern emerges, although dose-related increases in risk of multiple myeloma and of cancer of the prostate have been observed in two studies each. Combined analyses. Data from these studies represent most of the avail- able human data on protracted occupational exposure to ionizing radia- tion; it is therefore important to combine them in order to permit a more precise estimation of risk than is possible in individual studies. In the U.S., combined analyses have already been carried out (1). Data were assembled on white males employed for a minimum of 6 months at one of three U.S. Department of Energy facilities: the Hanford site, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, or Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant. The total cohort size is approximately 36,000 workers, with employment as early as 1943, an aver- age follow-up of approximately 20 years, and 5500 deaths accumulated at the end of the follow-up periods of the individual studies (1981, 1977, and 1979, respectively). The methods of analysis have been described by Gil- bert (this conference). These combined analyses provide no evidence of an association between radiation exposure and all-cancer or leukemia mortal- ity. Among the cancer types studied, only multiple myeloma was found to be significantly correlated with radiation dose. In the United Kingdom, data on employees of the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority, the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and the British Nuclear Fuels PLC are being combined to yield a cohort of approximately 85,000 workers, with employment as early as 1946 and, assuming follow-up to 1988, an estimated 14,000 deaths and a mean follow-up of 26 years (2). Efforts are underway to reconstruct complete exposure histories of workers who moved from one facility to another. Analyses of the combined UK data will commence in the autumn of 1990. International joint analyses are also starting, covering workers in Can- ada, the U.K., and the U.S., to increase the statistical power of the studies TABLE I Estimates of Annual Excess Mortality Risk for All Cancers 95% Excess deaths confidence (106PY/10 mSv) interval Scientific committees UNSCEAR 1988 4-11 ICRP 26 1977 4.0 BEIR III Linear 6.0 Linear-quadratic 2.5 Atom bomb survivors 1988 DS-86 10.1 (8.0-12.4)a Nuclear workers studies UKAEA (1987) 10-year lag 17.4 (-21.7, 62.3) Sellafield (1986) 15-year lag 17 (-30, 70) Hanford (1989) 10-year lag -29 (&lt;0, 26)a Combined U.S. analyses Hanford, ORNL, and Rocky Flats (1989) -30 (&lt;0, 11), a 90% Confidence interval.

They are being carried out at IARC, as part of an international collaborative study on cancer risk among workers in the nuclear industry, by a study group which includes the inves- tigators who originally carried out the studies, since they have the most detailed knowledge of design, dosimetry, data collection, and other aspects of the studies. The primary goal of this study is to estimate the change in cancer risk associated with increasing exposure to ionizing radiation in the low-dose range. This study also provides an opportunity for an across- country validation of data. In general, the statistical methods used will be similar to those which are currently being used in the national combined analyses (see Gilbert, this conference). Comparisons will be made by level of exposure within a carefully defined cohort rather than comparisons which involve external mortality rates. Excess relative risk (per 10 mSv), excess risk (per million person-years per 10 mSv), and associated confidence limits will be calculated for all cancers, all cancers except leukemia, all leukemia except chronic lympho- cytic leukemia, and other specific cancers of interest, and compared to estimates obtained by extrapolation from studies of individuals receiving high-dose acute exposures. The risk projection models which will be used for these comparisons will include the models currently considered for risk assessment (4). For individual cancer sites, the models proposed in the current BEIR (4) and current UNSCEAR (5) reports will be considered. New studies of nuclear workers. Following a meeting of epidemiologists, radiation biologists, and physicists, and nominees of the nuclear industry from 11 countries (Lyon, June 9 and 10, 1988), the feasibility of carrying out new studies of workers in the nuclear industry, in cohorts whose mortal- ity has not been considered yet, is being evaluated. New studies are desir- able to increase the statistical power to estimate cancer risk beyond what can be achieved by combining existing data. A study group was set up, consisting of IARC staff, of epidemiologists and experts in radiation biol- ogy and/or physics from the participating countries, and of some of the epidemiologists who had been involved in the previous studies. Table II summarizes, from the reports given at the meeting, the esti- mates of number of accumulated person-years and of total exposure, by country. Clearly, the United States and France offer the greatest possibili- ties for future studies, if one considers simply the number of person-years, but other countries may offer advantages in terms of the accessibility of employee exposure and follow-up information. The countries which have agreed to participate, at this stage, are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and</page><page sequence="16">ABSTRACTS 351 the United States. Collaboration is being proposed with other countries where a nuclear industry exists. The factors which will affect the feasibility of a study of cancer risk among nuclear industry workers in a given country or facility are of three types: technical, logistic, and legal. They include the degree to which infor- mation is accessible on computer, the ease with which it can be linked to registers of dosimetry, cancer mortality, or morbidity, and other sources of information. The cost of such a study will depend on the amount of infor- mation currently available in computerized form and on legal constraints on the use of centralized data banks. A detailed questionnaire (6) is being used to elicit the relevant information for each country as part of the feasibility study. Acknowledgments. The author thanks the members of the study group -V.

Medical personnel are distinguished among occupational groups ex- posed to radiation in having been studied longest for evidence of carcino- genic effects. Many of the British pioneers in radiology were included in Court Brown and Doll's study of radiologists (1). Compared with all profes- sional men in Britain, mortality from cancers of the skin, pancreas, and all cancers combined were statistically significantly raised in male radiologists working prior to 1921, when protective measures in radiology were either minimal or nonexistent. Extended follow-up of this cohort to 1977 (2) confirmed these excesses and also identified significantly raised mortality from lung cancer and leukemia (Table III). Although there was no evi- dence of excess cancer mortality in men entering radiological work after 1920, mortality in this subcohort of men increased significantly with time since entry to the study. Further follow-up of these men, which is currently being planned (S. Darby, personal communication), may therefore iden- tify excess cancer risks. Significantly raised mortality from skin cancer and leukemia was also observed in U.S. radiologists (3), but the findings for other cancer types are TABLE III Summary of Studies of Medical Personnel Exposed to Radiation Showing Cancer Types with Significantly4 Raised Risks Year of Relative riskb entry Cancer types (Number Study subgroup in excess of cases) Mortality in 1338 Pre-1921 Allc 1.41 (64) UK male radi- Pancreas 3.23 (6) ologists, 1897- Lung 2.18(8) 1954 (2) Skin 7.79 (6) Leukemia 6.15 (4) 1920-1954 No cancers differed significantly from expectation in this subgroup Mortality in 6524 1920-39 All 1.38 U.S. male radi- Mouth and pharynx 2.17 ologists, 1920- Liver (secondary) 3.22 1969 (3) Skin 3.38 Unspecified sites 1.69 Acute leukemia 2.23 Myeloid leukemia 2.39 Lymphosarcoma 2.73 1940-69 All 1.15 Mouth and pharynx 2.88 Lung 1.22 Multiple myeloma 2.05 Cancer incidence Pre-1960 All 1.55 (146) in 27,011 Chi- Esophagus 7.91 (11) nese X-ray Liver 2.24 (31) workers, 1950- Breast 2.22 (9) 1980 (4) Thyroid 2.84 (4) Leukemia 4.36 (16) 1960-69 All 1.59 (57) Liver 3.02 (12) Leukemia 4.13(11) 1970-80 No cancers differed significantly from expectation in this subgroup Mortality in 9179 1969-82d All 1.32 (137) Japanese radio- Large intestine 2.22 (20) logical technol- Neurocerebral 8.16 (4) ogists (5) 1983-86d Leukemia 5.83 (7) Othere 1.92 (27) Cancer incidence 10 or more All 1.13 (103) in 4281 Danish yearsd Prostate 6.25 (4) radiotherapists, 1954-82f(6) aP &lt; 0.05. b Adjusted for age and period.

In particular, mortality in this study was not in excess for pancreatic cancer but was for cancers of the mouth and pharynx, lymphosarcoma, and multiple myeloma. These ap- parently inconsistent findings are perhaps not surprising given that the two studies covered different periods and used different comparison groups, U.S. radiologists having been compared to other medical personnel thought unlikely to be exposed to radiation (such as otolaryngologists). A limitation of these early studies is that no data are available on radia- tion exposures for individual cohort members. It is therefore impossible to derive from them quantitative estimates of cancer risk associated with radiation exposure. Subsequent studies have attempted to improve on this either by incorporating data on indirect measures of exposure (such as duration of employment) or by obtaining direct estimates of exposure us- ing employees' dosimetric records. A recent study of cancer incidence in over 27,000 Chinese medical diagnostic X-ray workers falls into the first category (4). While cancer incidence in these workers was generally higher than that of other medical personnel, the excess was virtually confined to workers employed for 5 years or more. As in previous studies, raised cancer risks were most evident in those employed in earlier years (pre-1960 in this case) when exposure levels were highest (Table III). Significant excess risks of acute leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia, were identified-a pattern which broadly agrees with that found in U.S. radiologists. Thyroid, liver, and esophageal cancers were also significantly raised, though excesses for the latter two may result from differences in risk factors other than radiation, such as alcohol con- sumption. Unlike the radiologists, no excesses were evident for cancers of the pancreas, lung, mouth, and throat or from lymphosarcoma or multiple myeloma. Perhaps most surprising is the virtual lack of excess of skin cancer in this study. This may reflect a protective effect of skin pigmenta- tion in the workers (4). In contrast with the earlier studies, this study included women, of whom over 1000 had worked with medical X-ray equipment for more than 20 years. Breast cancer was significantly raised in this subgroup of workers. A mortality study of approximately 9000 Japanese radiological technolo- gists used information collected at interview on radiological exposures and protective conditions to estimate radiation exposures (5). Mortality from all cancers combined and stomach cancer increased significantly with in- creasing estimated radiation exposure. Overall mortality was found to be in excess for neurocerebral tumors, colon cancer, and leukemia though, curiously, the leukemia excess was only evident during the later period of follow-up (Table III). Collaborative efforts are currently underway to pro- vide risk estimates for radiation exposure on the basis of the Japanese and Chinese data (5). A study of Danish radiqther4pists is the first study of medical personnel to obtain dosimetric data on iridividual cohort members. Radiotherapists identified for inclusion in the study on the basis of radiation records were traced in the Danish cancer registry for information on cancer occurrence (6). As yet, only provisional results from this study are available. The average cumulative exposure in these workers (18 mSv) is relatively low, with only 3.6% of the cohort receiving cumulative doses over 100 mSv. Exposures for those working in the earliest years may be underestimated, however, because radiation records were not kept prior to 1954. There is little suggestion that cancer incidence is in excess of general population rates in this study, nor is there evidence of an association between cancer risk and cumulative exposure to radiation (6). A small excess of cancer in individuals followed up for 10 or more years was largely confined to pros- tate cancer (Table III). While based on only four cases, this excess is inter- esting given positive associations found between prostate cancer and radia- tion exposure in nuclear industry workers (7). Despite the availability of quantitative exposure data, the relatively small size of the Danish cohort limits its ability to provide reliable risk estimates, in the short term at least. A study of over 100,000 radiological technologists currently underway in the U.S. is likely to be the first study of medical personnel to contribute such information (J. D. Boice et al., un- published results). Exposure data for this study is being sought from em- ployee records and dosimetry companies. To date, dosimetric data have been collected for approximately 20% of the cohort. This has been linked to information regarding occupational history, medical conditions, and other personal and life-style characteristics obtained from an extensive health survey of the technologists. The overall response rate from the sur- vey is 79%. Provisional analyses have identified positive associations be- tween radiation exposure, personal exposure to medical X rays, and ciga- rette smoking. These associations indicate the potential value of the survey data for future analyses in this study, which will include evaluating mor- tality, cancer incidence, exposure assessment, dose response, and risk analyses. A notable characteristic of U.S. radiological technologists is that they are primarily women, many of whom started working in their late teens or early twenties. Not only does this permit closer study of female cancers than previously possible, but it may also allow examination of cancer risk in the offspring of a large number of women occupationally exposed to radiation. This last issue is a central objective of a study of radiographers currently underway in the United Kingdom (E. Roman, personal commu- nication). This study is obtaining detailed occupational and reproductive histories from radiographers identified by initial screening survey as hav- ing children with cancer, congenital malformations, developmental retar- dation, or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. These will be compared with similar information relating to a matched sample of radiographers with unaffected children. Acknowledgments.

The three papers presented in this session provide a nice overview of what is happening in occupational studies and what will be happening in the near future. As shown in Dr. Cardis' paper and Dr. Gilbert's paper, one</page><page sequence="18">ABSTRACTS 353 clear trend for studies of nuclear workers is the need to combine data across cohorts to obtain more precise estimates of dose-response relation- ships. While such combined estimates are desirable, they present some special problems. The first problem is that of confounders. Nuclear power plant workers, who represent the two largest potential cohorts (U.S. and French nuclear workers), are exposed to 50 to 60 magnetic fields, which some studies suggest can cause leukemia. Nuclear power plant workers are also exposed to "solvents." These are primarily degreasing agents, and may include compounds like benzene, a known leukemogen. Both electric-field expo- sure and solvent exposure (in subsequent discussion, asbestos was men- tioned as another confounder) may be associated with radiation exposure, and could thus inflate radiation risk estimates. A second problem is intercohort heterogeneity, which I take to include both biological differences (e.g., Japanese smokers have much lower lung cancer risks than American smokers) and differences in domestic record- keeping practices. To illustrate the potential problem, consider that ran- dom errors in dose tend to "flatten" dose-response curves. Likewise, slopes may differ simply because one cohort has greater sensitivity than another cohort. For example, say we are comparing dose response for leukemia versus radiation dose in French and American power plant workers, and find that Americans have a significantly smaller dose-re- sponse coefficient. Does this mean that Americans are tough, or that they cannot measure dose very well? Misleading paradigms pose another potential difficulty. As Dr. Gilbert demonstrated, the present database does not allow one to parameterize elaborate models. All one can do is check for consistency with the Japanese data. However, the Japanese received a single large dose, while worker doses are highly fractionated. Further, the hazard functions for several diseases (recall Seymour Jablon's comments on leukemia) differ markedly between Japanese and American populations. Thus, while the Japanese provide a useful starting place, it is important to remember that it may be the wrong place. In closing, I would like to offer some suggestions for future work. First, I wonder if we might be able to develop some diagnostic procedures to identify misclassified dosimetry data. One might, for example, impute each dose record as though it were missing, and modify those records which were very different from their imputed values. I also think Dr. Car- penter's presentation raises an interesting point because, in the medical radiation cohorts, individual dosimetry is, for the most part, lacking. Could those individuals with dose data be used to "calibrate" some sort of bioindicator which could be used to infer dose for the rest of the cohort? (Subsequent discussion suggested this is beyond the present state of the art.) A final observation is that occupational studies are likely to get much more interesting in years to come. For example, as Elizabeth Cardis showed, there are more than 1,000,000 persons in the U.S. Nuclear Power Plant Workers cohort, and 600,000 in the French Nuclear Workers cohort. Some of the individuals have low doses, but even the relatively high dose groups provide cohorts which are large compared to those from the DOE facilities. Moreover, the typical U.S. power plant worker is, at present, less than 50 years of age. As these cohorts enter their 60s, they will express many more tumors, including excess tumors. As this occurs, we will be able to test biologically based models both from radiobiology and from cancer biology in general (e.g., multistage; Moolgavkar, Venson, Knudsen) with some rigor. For this reason the future of occupational cohort studies in the 21st century appears bright indeed. The Design of an Epidemiologic Study for the Evaluation of Lung Cancer Risk and Residential Exposure to Radon. STUART L. SHALAT, Yale University School of Medicine (with L. E. Rothney, J. L. Lyon, D. P. Sandler, C. R. Weinberg). The investigation of the potential health effects of radon has risen to near the top of the public health agenda as a result of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's classification of radon as the number two preventable cause of lung cancer. The pronouncement, however, was made in the face of as yet significant gaps in our knowledge of radon as a lung carcinogen. At present there is little doubt, based upon existing studies of miners, that radon exposure increases the risk for the development of lung cancer (1- 4). There are, however, several important remaining questions. First, what is the risk of developing lung cancer at the levels of exposure present in private residences (5, 6)? Second, are there significant risks associated with radon exposure to nonsmokers (7)? Finally, is there an appreciable syner- gistic effect of exposure to both radon and cigarette smoke (both active and passive) (7)? In planning an epidemiologic investigation of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure, adequate attention must be paid to accurate and timely diagnosis, exposure reconstruction, and smoking history. Diag- nostic accuracy is, of course, a necessary prerequisite for all epidemiologic studies, but in this case, it is also essential that cases be rapidly identified because of the often poor prognosis associated with lung cancer. The qual- ity of the detailed information needed for such a study would be seriously compromised if it were necessary to rely on data provided primarily by the next of kin of a deceased subject. Radon exposure reconstruction is central to an understanding of the dose-response relationship. Since the critical exposure period is likely to be several decades in length, the investigator must often deal with numerous dwellings. Lastly, detailed smoking histo- ries, beyond the usual information required to calculate simple pack-years, are important to the evaluation of the effect of timing of smoking and radon exposure in relation to cancer risk. A large-scale epidemiologic study of radon and lung cancer is currently underway at Yale University and the University of Utah. This study is being done in collaboration with and funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. In the Yale component of the study the rapid identification of cases is carried out by the use of a Rapid Ascertain- ment System (RAS). This system works with and supplements the long- standing Connecticut State Tumor Registry (CTR). Whereas the tumor registry relies on passive reporting by hospitals, RAS has a trained abstrac- tor visit all 35 public and private hospitals and 2 Veterans Administration Hospitals in Connecticut on a monthly basis. The hospital records are abstracted and subsequently entered into a computerized database. All records are cross-checked against the tumor registry to avoid duplication and to screen out second occurrences of lung cancer that otherwise might be mistaken as primary tumors. In the case of indeterminate site of pri- mary tumor further medical record review and/or physician contact is carried out. Median time from diagnosis to entrance into the computerized database is 38 days, as opposed to 6 months or more for the CTR by itself. This relatively short turnaround time between actual diagnosis and identi- fication of the case enhances the ability of investigator to contact study subjects at the earliest possible date, since up to one-third of all lung cancer cases may die in that 6-month period. To observe an effect there must be sufficient variation in radon exposure levels. The residential radon distribution is highly skewed, with most homes having negligible radon levels (8). Furthermore, there is evidence that even houses next door to each other can have very different radon levels. Thus it is unlikely that a person would reside in more than one home with high radon levels. It is easy to see that for individuals with many residences, the cumulative radon exposure would tend toward the mean (low) exposure. To minimize the effect of this, we have restricted our study to individuals with a limited number of prior residences. All potential study subjects (cases and controls) are administered a screening questionnaire to determine if they have been Connecticut resi- dents since the age of 25. Further, 75% of the time between the age of 25 and 5 years prior to diagnosis must be accounted for by four or fewer residences. Once this basic eligibility is established, subjects are randomly recruited for study according to preestablished selection criteria (9). The selection process will provide relative balance between cases and controls in terms of smoking status, age, and sex. The approach we are using is not, strictly speaking, matching. Subjects are recruited randomly and selected with known sampling probabilities. It will be possible to estimate risks</page><page sequence="19">354 ABSTRACTS associated with smoking and evaluate interaction. Such would not be the case if we had matched or restricted the study to a particular smoking category. The randomized recruitment approach has the added advantage of allowing for simultaneous recruitment of cases and controls, since the selection criteria are based on prior information, not the actual distribu- tion of the relevant factors in the cases studied. Detailed residential histories are obtained from all study subjects. Ad- dresses are verified using telephone books, voter registration, tax records, and other sources, as well as descriptive data provided by subjects them- selves. Permission to access the residences is requested from current owners and radon is measured using a minimum of two alpha-track detec- tors in each residence (10). Detectors are placed in the primary living area and the subject's bedroom and left to be exposed for 1 year. If more than I h per week is spent in the basement then this area will be measured as well. Additional information will also be sought on the structure of past homes at the time the subject was in residence. This allows a determination to be made as to whether there have been significant modifications that may have affected radon levels. In the event that a structure is no longer stand- ing, or permission to enter the dwelling to monitor for radon is denied, estimates of exposure may be used. Depending on the results of feasibility studies these estimates may be based on a combination of radon exposure measurements for that city or town, models using results from similar homes, or outdoor measurements and local geology. A significant problem in designing studies of radon and lung cancer is that most cases of lung cancer (&gt;90%) occur in smokers (11). As a result, a study of an incident series of lung cancers would have to be inordinately large in order to have adequate power to address the question of radon and lung cancer risk in the subgroup of nonsmokers, or to deal with the ques- tion of interaction. Since there are expected to be few nonsmokers in any series of lung cancer patients, and because of cost constraints, it is not practical to study all lung cancer patients in a particular period. We have instead chosen to study all nonsmokers with lung cancer but only a sample of smokers. Thus, of the 1,000 cases we plan to study, we expect to include approximately 400 nonsmokers rather than the 80 to 120 that would be expected by the natural distribution of lung cancer cases. To evaluate best the lung cancer risk associated with the possible interac- tion of radon and cigarette smoking, detail beyond the standard pack-year history of cigarette smoking is necessary. For this reason smoking history is time-period specific to allow the linking of smoking habit with residential radon exposure. Time-dependent models of radon and smoke exposure will be developed. Models will also take into account other smoking details such as brand or type of cigarette smoked. Information will be sought, as well on passive exposure to cigarette smoke. Such information will be linked with residential histories, and will be validated (current exposure only) in a small sample of homes (12). Acknowledgment.

Statistical Aspects of the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruc- tion Project and the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study. RICHARD O. GIL- BERT, Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (with J. C. Simpson, B. A. Napier, H. A. Haerer, A. M. Liebetrau, A. J. Ruttenber, S. Davis). Introduction. The Hanford Site in southwestern Washington State was selected in 1943 for plutonium production facilities. Data made available in 1986 by the U.S. Department of Energy describing atmospheric releases of substantial quantities of 131I during the early operational years of Han- ford suggested that large radiation doses to the thyroid could have been received by nearby residents. This possibility resulted in a strong interest by the public to document potential adverse health effects that may have resulted from such exposures. These concerns led to the establishment in 1988 of two closely related studies: the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction (HEDR) Proj- ect and the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study (HTDS). The HEDR Project, which is being conducted by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory under the direction of an independent technical steering panel, was established to estimate doses that people may have received from radionuclides released from the Hanford facilities since 1944. The primary purpose of the HTDS study, which is being conducted by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in collaboration with investigators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), is to determine whether thyroid disease is increased among persons who were exposed as infants and young children to releases of radioactive iodine from Hanford from 1944 through 1957. The CDC was directed by the U.S. Congress in 1988 to conduct such an epidemiological study. This abstract briefly discusses (i) the statistical methods used in Phase I of the HEDR Project to assess uncertainties in preliminary esti- mates of doses to the thyroid from "31I via the air-pasture-cow-milk-hu- man pathway in the period 1944 through 1947, and (ii) the feasibility and design of the HTDS (1).</page><page sequence="20">ABSTRACTS 355 The HEDR Project is being conducted in phases beginning with limited geographical area, time, exposure pathways, populations, and radionu- clides. The Phase I study area consists of a 10-county region surrounding the Hanford Site (100-mi radius), including a nearby stretch of the Colum- bia River. Phase I preliminary dose estimates (and their uncertainties) for populations and reference individuals for 1944 through 1947 for air path- ways and 1964 through 1966 for Columbia River pathways have recently been reported (2-4). Phase I is a "pilot" or "demonstration" phase. Final dose estimates are planned to be available in 1994. HEDR Project statistical analyses. Uncertainties in estimated doses re- sult from uncertainties in specifying the problem (scenario), formulating the conceptual and computational models, identifying appropriate values for the model parameters, and calculating and documenting results. The HEDR Project is assessing these uncertainties by conducting validation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses, by using quality assurance proce- dures for computations and documentation, and through extensive peer review. During Phase I, HEDR Project staff developed a preliminary Monte Carlo (simulation) computer code for estimating preliminary air pathway 131I doses to the thyroid of reference individuals and populations and for assessing uncertainties in those doses caused by uncertainties in model parameter values. The uncertainty in each input parameter of the model was described by a probability distribution of possible values (e.g., triangu- lar or lognormal distributions) that could apply to the parameters. Each distribution characterized either a lack of knowledge or stochastic variabil- ity for the true value(s) for the parameter. Other methods for conducting uncertainty analyses were also considered in Phase I, including second- moment analysis (truncated Taylor Series expansions) and the multiplica- tive lognormal method applicable to multiplicative models with lognor- mally distributed terms (5). However, these methods were not used in Phase I because they provide less accurate results than Monte Carlo simula- tions. The Phase I Monte Carlo dose code for the air pathway was written in separate modules (air and vegetation, milk production, milk accumulation at creameries, milk distribution to stores, and human exposure and dose). The outputs of each module were stored in the computer in histogram form and recalled as needed later in the code. This approach did not re- quire holding vast amounts of information in memory. However, many hours of computer time were needed to store and retrieve the histograms. Also, the Phase I modular code did not compute and store the structural correlations among modular outputs. Results of a computer simulation study conducted by the HEDR Project in Phase I indicated that ignoring these correlations changed only slightly the distributions of doses for the scenario that gave the highest preliminary Phase I doses; namely, infants drinking fresh milk from a family cow that consumed fresh pasture in a downwind area. During Phase II, the modular approach is expected to be replaced by a nonmodular simulation code or by a modular code that retains the correlation structure. In addition, Latin Hypercube Sampling (6) may be used in later phases of the project because it requires fewer iterations of the Monte Carlo code than simple random sampling to achieve the same accuracy in the distribution of doses. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted during Phase II to rank model input parameters with respect to their contributions to the uncertainty in the estimated dose. These analyses will be used to help allocate project financial resources to achieve the greatest reduction of uncertainty in dose estimates. One method of sensitivity analysis that appears promising is to conduct regression and correlation analyses and rank parameters using partial rank correlation coefficients (7). Feasibility of conducting an epidemiologic study of thyroid disease. The first step in assessing the feasibility of conducting an epidemiologic study of thyroid disease in populations exposed to releases of radioactive iodine from Hanford is to develop preliminary estimates of the magnitude of the thyroid doses that people could have received and to estimate the statistical power of any study that would be contemplated. Beginning in 1987, prelim- inary (pre-HEDR) dose estimates obtained by the Washington State De- partment of Health and the CDC were used in conjunction with data describing the number of births per year in the counties most exposed to estimate the statistical power of an epidemiological study of exposed and unexposed birth cohorts (8). Planning focused on people who were chil- dren during the time of greatest exposure because children most likely received higher doses as a result of consuming dairy products. Also, chil- dren generally receive higher thyroid doses per unit exposure and experi- ence higher risks of thyroid cancer per unit dose. Preliminary analyses suggested an epidemiological study would likely have adequate statistical power. The HEDR Project preliminary estimates of dose to the thyroid provide additional information for evaluating power. Design of the Hanford thyroid disease study. The HTDS currently being planned is cohort in design. The primary purpose of the study is to deter- mine whether thyroid disease is increased among people who were exposed as infants and young children to releases of radioactive iodine from Han- ford from 1944 through 1957. Though the diseases of primary interest are thyroid cancer, benign thyroid nodules, and hypothyroidism, other thy- roid and parathyroid diseases will also be assessed. Preliminary results from the HEDR Project indicate that thyroid doses received by the public were not uniformly distributed in the population. Thus the exposed cohort will be selected from a stratified random sample of births in the counties which likely received the highest exposures: Ben- ton, Franklin, and Walla Walla in Washington State. Exposed subjects will be selected equally from rural and urban areas, assuming that rural chil- dren had a greater likelihood of consuming contaminated milk. Compari- son subjects will be selected in an identical manner from counties farther away from the Hanford Site and upwind of the releases. The relationship between radiation dose to the thyroid and disease will be evaluated primarily in two ways. The more meaningful will be an analy- sis based on individual dose estimates and their associated levels of uncer- tainty. These estimates will be obtained from the HEDR Project for each study subject based on information collected by interviewing the subject's mother or another close relative regarding the subject's residential and dietary history as an infant and child. Alternative analyses will be based on a qualitative classification of radiation dose (e.g., high, medium, and low or exposed vs unexposed). Surrogate measures for individual dose, such as urban vs rural residence or the consumption of milk from a backyard cow vs the consumption of processed milk, will be used to classify study sub- jects. It is anticipated that the results of the HTDS will also contribute to a better understanding of the carcinogenicity of 131I in humans. It appears that the doses to exposed persons in this study will encompass a range not previously evaluated in studies of people who received 131I for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Also, the exposures from Hanford were delivered over long periods of time, in contrast to those delivered over hours or days in previous studies. Acknowledgment.

The Utah Fallout Study. DUNCAN C. THOMAS, University of Southern California. Between 1951 and 1958, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission carried out more than 100 above-ground nuclear weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), and at least 50 of these tests deposited measurable quantities of radioactive fallout in Utah and Nevada. Washington County in Southwest- ern Utah received the highest exposure, with bone marrow doses totaling 19 mGy on a population-weighted basis over the total period of testing. A number of studies have examined the question of adverse health ef- fects from fallout to people living in the area. Between 1979 and 1987, four studies were published on the possible association between leukemia and fallout exposure from the NTS (1-4). All found significant increases in southwestern Utah, with relative risks ranging from 1.5 to 5.3, depending on the definitions of the exposed region, time, age group, and other meth- odologic factors. In the early 1970s, a series of papers (5-8) reported the results of a comparison of the prevalence of thyroid diseases in children exposed to NTS fallout and an unexposed control group in Arizona; al- though the prevalence of nodules and thyroiditis was higher in the exposed area, neither difference was statistically significant. All of these studies were based on geographical comparisons between exposed and unexposed areas, and none had an estimate of doses from fallout radiation to the target organs of the individual study subjects. To address this problem, two studies were commissioned by the National Cancer Institute, one of leukemia and one of thyroid disease. The presenta- tion will give the results of the former (9) and describe the methods and current status of the latter. Case-control study of leukemia. A population-based case-control study was done to examine the association between leukemia and fallout dose from NTS. Cases comprised all deaths from leukemia among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) who died between 1952 and 1981, were Utah residents at the time of death, and were born before 1958. Controls were an age-stratified random sample of all nonleu- kemia deaths meeting the same eligibility criteria as cases. To account for an imbalance between cases and controls in their dates of death (an impor- tant determinant of potential fallout exposure), cases and controls were later matched on sex, age at death, and date of death. The final analysis included 1177 cases and 5330 controls. Radiation doses from fallout were estimated by abstracting residence histories from church records and combining them with detailed estimates of fallout deposition rates by location and time for each shot. The dosime- try algorithm involved computation of a probability distribution of the bone marrow doses for each subject, based on uncertainties in each step of the dose computation, including uncertainties in the deposition rates and times of arrival of the fallout cloud, gaps in residence histories and uncer- tainties about subjects' move dates, and uncertainties about personal shielding factors. For most epidemiologic analyses, the arithmetic mean of this distribution of possible doses was used as the point estimate of the dose for each subject, but some analyses also exploited the variance of that distribution. The data were analyzed using standard conditional logistic regression methods for stratum-matched case-control data. Statistical issues to be discussed include the use of all-cause death rates as an offset term to correct for any bias from the use of dead controls, the need for exact methods given the sparseness of the data at high doses, the use of the uncertainty estimates to correct for exposure measurement errors, and the methods used to com- pare risk estimates from this study with the Japanese atomic bomb survi- vor data and to estimate the number of cases attributable to NTS fallout. A positive but nonsignificant association was found between fallout dose and leukemia for all ages, all times, and all cell types combined. This included a weak association with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that is generally believed not to be radiogenic. In our data, the CLL associa- tion was mainly restricted to older subjects, later deaths, and those with hairy-cell leukemia; we have therefore followed the usual practice of ex- cluding these cases from all further analyses. With this exclusion, the esti- mated odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) were 1.08 (0.91-1.27) and 1.69 (1.01-2.84) for bone marrow doses 3-5.9 and 6-30 mGy, respec- tively. Significant trends were found in various subgroups defined by cell type, age, and latency, in the directions predicted by other studies-larger rela- tive risks for acute leukemias, for deaths under age 20, and for the first 10 years after exposure. In particular, the odds ratios in the intersection of these three subgroups were 1.33 (0.64-2.76) and 7.82 (1.90-32.2) for inter- mediate and high dose, respectively. However, no association was seen for those who were in utero during the fallout period, an observationitlat is consistent with the experience of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. We compared our risk estimates with those derived by the BEIR V report (10) by computing a predicted excess relative risk (ERR) for each subject, based on their dose, age at exposure, and time since exposure. Treating this variable as continuous, the fitted slope estimate was 1.00 with a standard error of 0.46 (where the predicted slope would be 1.0). However, upon grouping the predicted ERRs, the observed ERRs were from 2.2 to 2.7 times larger than predicted (with confidence limits that included the predicted values for each category). This discrepancy could be due to arti- facts in the choice of cutpoints or to undue sensitivity of the continuous analyses to a few influential observations. We conclude that, although the risk estimates from these data may be somewhat larger than the Japanese estimates, they do not support a hypothesis that extrapolation from higher doses has markedly underestimated risk. Because of the large statistical uncertainties in the estimates from this study, they are not useful for quan- titative risk estimation. An empirical Bayes method was used to allow for the uncertainties in the dose estimates (11); the method and results will be discussed in another presentation (12). In the subgroup of early, acute leukemias in children, adjustment for uncertainties in deposition rates increased the slope esti- mate by only 1%, and adjustment for uncertainties in residence histories increased the slope estimate by 12%. Further adjustment for uncertainties in shielding reduced the slope estimate. These adjustments also increased the standard error of the slope estimates, slightly reducing the significance of the trend, although the one-tailed P value remained less than 0.05. The high-dose subgroup, mainly those who lived in Washington County during the fallout period, comprised only 17 cases over the 30-year period. Of these, we estimate that about 5 or 6 might be attributable to fallout (attributable risks (AR) of 29-36%), based on the Japanese or the fallout study risk estimates, respectively, although the confidence limits on these estimates are wide. If the linear dose-response model is correct, roughly 6% of leukemias in the rest of Utah (about 50 cases among LDS members) might be attributable to NTS fallout. Although the overall result was not statistically significant, the findings in the subgroups where other studies predicted the risks should be concen- trated are unlikely to be due to chance. We searched carefully for possible sources of bias, but were unable to find any that could convincingly ex- plain the findings. The study groups withstood numerous checks on their</page><page sequence="22">ABSTRACTS 357 representativeness. The same data bases and rules to handle uncertainties were used to construct residence histories and assign doses, so any expo- sure errors should have been nondifferential. Because of the design of the study, it was not possible to collect data on possible confounders, so the possibility that an important risk factor might have been associated with exposure cannot be ruled out. Limited data from other sources were avail- able on medical and background radiation, occupational exposures, prior cancer treatments, migration, and genetic syndromes. None of these ap- peared to be systematic confounders. This study confirmed the excess of leukemia in southwestern Utah that was found in previous studies and demonstrated an association with fall- out dose among individuals. In view of the consistency of our findings with other literature and the lack of other plausible explanations, we conclude that the excess in southwestern Utah is probably not due to chance and probably is attributable to fallout. However, the estimated number of cases attributed to fallout in this region is small and these cases are indistinguish- able from those caused by other factors. The predicted excess outside of southwestern Utah is undetectable by epidemiologic means, and the small but nonsignificant increases we found were consistent with this prediction. Cohort study of thyroid diseases in children. Between 1965 and 1970, a group of 4819 school children in grades 5-12 in Washington County, Utah, Lincoln County, Nevada, and Graham County, Arizona, were exam- ined by physicians from the U.S. Public Health Service (5-8). The major limitations of that study were the lack of any dose estimates and the possi- bility that not enough time had elapsed since exposure for any radiation effects to be fully expressed. In 1982, the National Cancer Institute awarded a contract to the University of Utah to reexamine these children and estimate doses from fallout to their thyroid glands. Of the original cohort, it was possible to locate 4180 subjects (87%); 3367 (81%) of these were still living in the three-state area. Because only a small proportion of those who had moved away were available to be examined and were unlikely to be representative, the follow-up study was restricted to the 2829 subjects (84.0% of those eligible) who were still living in the three-state area and were available to be examined. Each subject was examined by one of eight trained nurse practitioners, who referred any suspected abnormalities to the study endocrinologist, Dr. Marvin Rallison. A total of 730 patients were referred, of whom 413 had additional laboratory studies ordered, 44 were referred to a clinical re- search center, 39 underwent thyroid 1231 scans, 46 had fine needle biopsies, and 27 had surgery. In the three areas combined, the final diagnoses showed prevalence rates (per 1000) of 28.7 for goiter, 51.3 for thyroiditis, 15.9 for hypothyroidism, 3.9 for hyperthyroidism, 23.3 for nodules, 7.8 for neoplasms, and 3.5 for carcinomas. Except for carcinomas, the rates were higher in Utah/Nevada than in Arizona, but none of these differences were statistically significant. To estimate thyroid doses, the mother or closest available relative was interviewed by telephone to obtain information about the subject's con- sumption of milk and leafy green vegetables at various ages, the source of these foods, the mother's diet while pregnant or breastfeeding, and possible confounding factors. Interviews were completed for 3545 subjects (85% of those located), 2756 of whom were also examined and living in the three- state area (82% of those eligible). These diet histories were combined with information about deposition rates and times of arrival from each shot and separate surveys of dairy and farming practice to produce probability distributions of thyroid dose for each study subject, in a manner similar to the leukemia study. The mean thyroid doses were 260 mGy in Utah, 76 mGy in Nevada, and 26 mGy in Arizona; 6.7% of Utah subjects had thyroid doses over 800 mGy. Epidemiological analyses are currently underway to relate the preva- lence of the various thyroid abnormalities during the first and second phases of the study and the incidence of new abnormalities between phases to these estimates of radiation doses. The major statistical issues to be dealt with include the choice of appropriate risk models, the need for exact methods given the rarity of the most interesting disease end points, how to deal with differences in referral rates between screening examiners, and use of the dose uncertainty estimates.

Although there is abundant evidence of the ability of radiation to cause cancer in man, considerable uncertainty still exists over many of the issues that affect radiation risk estimation. Further understanding is needed of the shape of the dose-response curve over a wide range of organ doses, and the modifying effects of fractionation of dose, age at first exposure, time since irradiation, radiation quality, and other factors. Studies of cancer patients treated with radiotherapy have been particularly useful in increas- ing our knowledge of radiation carcinogenesis since their exposures can be</page><page sequence="23">358 ABSTRACTS precisely quantified, a nonexposed comparison group is frequently avail- able, and cancer patients are usually followed for long periods of time. In addition, low-dose exposures to organs outside the radiation treatment fields provide information of direct relevance to current scientific and pub- lic health concerns about low-dose radiation risk. This summary will re- view several recently completed and some ongoing epidemiologic studies that characterize the risk of radiation-induced second cancers, with empha- sis on studies providing data on the dose-response relationship. Several recent investigations have demonstrated that cancer patients treated with partial-body, high-dose radiotherapy have a much lower risk of developing a subsequent leukemia than would be expected from estab- lished risk estimates. In a large international study of over 150,000 cervical cancer patients, women treated with an average bone marrow dose of 7.1 Gy (710 rad) were found to have a significantly increased risk of leukemia, but the risk was small (twofold) (1). Leukemia risk rose with increasing dose to reach a peak at 2.5-5.0 Gy (250-500 rad) and then decreased at higher dose levels. It was thought that the very high dose to the pelvic bone marrow resulted in destroying or inactivating a large proportion of the marrow cells, leaving fewer cells available for malignant transformation. To account for the inhomogeneous dose distribution, a linear exponential model was fitted which summed incremental risks to 14 individual bone marrow masses. The model included a linear induction term and a nega- tive exponential term to account for cell loss at high doses. The estimated relative risk at 1 Gy (100 rad) was 1.7, which was several times lower than that seen for the atomic bomb survivors (2). Other recent studies that have evaluated large populations and utilized detailed dosimetry have found little evidence that high-dose radiotherapy appreciably increases the risk of leukemia. Breast cancer patients treated with beam therapy in Connecticut during 1935 to 1972 had no discernible elevation in leukemia risk (3). No difference in risk was found between those patients receiving under 5 Gy (500 rad) to the active marrow as compared to those treated with over 5 Gy. In a multi-institutional study, the Late Effects Study Group (LESG) evaluated more than 9000 children and found no significant difference in the risk of leukemia by radiation dose after adjustment for the use of alkylating agents (4). Another large multicenter study of ovarian cancer patients also reported little excess leu- kemia risk associated with radiotherapy (RR = 1.6) and no suggestion of a dose response in a comparison of patients receiving under 10 Gy (1000 rad) with those receiving over 10 Gy (5). In contrast, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated at the National Cancer Institute with total-body or hemibody radiotherapy were found to have a high risk of leukemia that was significantly associated with increas- ing radiation dose to the active bone marrow (6). These were unique expo- sures in which large volumes of bone marrow were exposed to relatively low cumulative doses of radiation. Other studies of non-Hodgkin's lym- phoma patients treated with high-dose radiation to limited fields have not found any detectable risk (7). The leukemogenic effect of radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease is still in question. Most studies have reported little or no evidence of an excess when radiation is used as a single modality (8-10), although high risks based on small numbers have been found in two inves- tigations (11, 12). Conflicting evidence exists on the synergism between radiotherapy and chemotherapy (8, 12). The association of radiotherapy with the risk of second solid tumors has been less thoroughly explored. Few studies attempt to relate risk to organ dose estimates. The International Cervical Cancer Study is the largest se- ries to date to provide risk estimates by dose on a number of different second cancer sites (13). A sharp dose-response gradient was seen for sec- ond cancers of the rectum, bladder, and vagina after high organ doses exceeding 30 Gy (3000 rad). Dose-related excesses were also suggested for cancers of the ovary, bone, stomach, kidney, thyroid, and cecum. Al- though a significant deficit was found overall for second breast cancer, women with intact ovaries had a suggestion of an increased risk at breast doses of 0.25-0.49 Gy (25-49 rad) (14). Surprisingly, radiation to the colon was not associated with excess tumors, either overall or in the high- dose group. Similarly, dose-dependent excesses were not apparent for cancer of the pancreas, connective tissue, multiple myeloma, chronic lym- phocytic leukemia, and lymphoma. For many sites, risks were concen- trated in 20+ year survivors, and in women under age 55 years at irradia- tion. Overall, no more than 5% of second cancers could be linked to radia- tion therapy. Children irradiated for an initial cancer appear to be at a particularly high risk to develop a second cancer (15, 16). Data from the Late Effects Study Group showed that both radiotherapy and alkylating agent therapy have an independent effect on the risk of subsequent bone cancer (17). With radiation dose measured to the site of the bone cancer, risk of bone tumors increased steeply in the dose range 10-60 Gy (1000-6000 rad) and reached a peak at 40-fold for doses of 60 Gy or more. The bone cancer risks for children with genetically linked retinoblastoma were similar in each dose category to those for all other initial cancers. Radiotherapy also ap- peared to cause a dose-related increase in second thyroid cancer among survivors of childhood cancer, with especially high risks seen for doses over 30 Gy (3000 rad) (18, 19). Hodgkin's disease patients have been reported to have increases of sec- ond cancers of the lung, stomach, breast, bone, and soft tissue and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma that were suggestive of a radiation effect (11, 20-23). However, to date, no studies have evaluated the relationship of risk to radiation dose for such patients. Cancer registry studies have described an increased risk of developing leukemia and other second cancers among women irradiated for uterine corpus cancer (24-26). These findings are currently being investigated in an NCI-sponsored international case-control study of leukemia following uterine corpus cancer including over 200 cases and 700 matched controls. Individual doses to the active bone marrow are being determined for each exposed patient and generalized relative risk functions will be fitted to the data to describe the dose-response relationship. An important advantage of this population is the existence of a large nonexposed comparison group (about one-third of the patients are treated with surgery only) and the ability to study a wide dose range. The next phase of this investigation will assess the risk of radiation-related second solid cancers in a large cohort study of approximately 100,000 uterine corpus cancer patients reported to 1 of 13 cancer registries. Detailed case-control studies may be initiated to obtain dosimetry information necessary for organ-specific risk estimates. NCI is also currently conducting or is collaborating with other institu- tions on several epidemiologic investigations to quantify further the risk of radiation-induced second cancers. Populations under study include pa- tients with cancer of the breast, ovary, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, retinoblastoma, and other childhood cancer survivors. In gen- eral, the research is focused on quantifying the risk of therapy-induced solid tumors by dose, evaluating the individual and combined contribu- tions to risk of radiation and chemotherapy, and exploring the interaction of radiation with other risk factors, such as genetic susceptibility. In addi- tion, NCI will periodically continue to monitor data from cancer registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program to detect leads of therapy-related second cancers that should be pursued in future studies.

CHIACCHIERINI, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Animal studies. The risk of thyroid cancer following irradiation with ~31' has been the topic of much discussion for the last few decades. The early animal studies summarized in a paper by Doniach (1) suggested that, based on combining the results of several animal experiments (2-4), 1311 is ap- proximately 10 times less effective at inducing thyroid cancer than equiva- lent doses of X irradiation. These early studies were frequently done with high doses of X rays (500-2000 cGy) or very high exposures of 13'I (0.74- 1.48 MBq). Only one small study directly compared the two types of radia- tion in the same controlled experiment. Furthermore, these studies fre- quently were of insufficient size to account for a number of factors such as colony survival, sex, age, and others. These factors are now known to affect radiation thyroid cancer induction. In 1976, the Bureau of Radiological Health conducted an extensive liter- ature review on radiogenic thyroid cancer induction from '31I and X rays and noted the potential biases extant in the referenced data. A study was designed, using female Long-Evans rats, to compare directly the biological effectiveness of exposures to ~31' relative to X irradiation within the dose range of 0-1000 cGy. Substantial care went into developing the dosimetry and study design and conducting the analysis to avoid some of the prob- lems encountered in the earlier work. The female was chosen because the investigators believed that females were probably more sensitive than males to thyroid cancer induction. The prepubescent animal was chosen because of its higher thyroid activity which would probably lead to en- hanced sensitivity of the thyroid to radiation-induced cancer. The results of the dosimetry study (done concurrently with the tumor study) were published in Radiation Research in 1979 (5). Utilizing the MIRD method of dose calculation and a more complete determination of the '~3I uptake curve, the study results indicated that previous rat thyroid tumor studies using the then "accepted" dosimetric method overestimated the thyroid doses by 60-70%. The results of the tumor study were published in Radiation Research in 1982 (6). The findings of the study revealed that (1) localized external X rays and ''I are similar in thyroid carcinoma induction in prepubescent Long-Evans female rats for mean thyroid doses of 0-1000 cGy; (2) thyroid carcinoma induction appears to be independent of the dose rates used in</page><page sequence="25">360 ABSTRACTS the study; (3) the thyroid response functions for carcinoma are nearly proportional to the square root of the dose; and (4) localized X-ray doses of 410 cGy to the pituitary, whether administered concomitantly with thy- roid irradiation or without, did not modify the risk of thyroid tumor. This study has received extensive scrutiny in the radiological community, and, in each instance, the results have remained unaffected. A primary concern of the critics is the large underlying thyroid medullary tumor rate in the Long-Evans rat (27.7% for this study). The results of the study indicated, however, that this rate was not affected by either type or dose of ionizing radiation used in the study. Human study. In the paper following this one, a review of the available human data involving thyroid cancer and 13'I will be presented. In this paper, the study conducted by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), FDA, will be discussed. At about the same time that the rat study began, a human investigation involving diagnostic exposures of children or adolescents to "'3I was also initiated. This effort had a long and rocky history, mostly resulting from patchwork funding. In the early 1970s, a pilot study was begun at the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1977, CDRH took on the study and extended the study population, projecting the follow-up of 6500 exposed patients and 6500 unexposed controls. The results of the study to date are reported in a recent CDRH publica- tion (7). The study was intended to have 80% power of detecting a three- fold increase in the risk of thyroid cancer at the 5% level of significance. Unfortunately, funding was inadequate to complete the entire study proto- col. Follow-up included only 3503 exposed patients, 1509 thyroid function test controls, and 1085 diagnostic controls. Two types of controls were necessary because, in some facilities, a log of the patients entering the endocrinology clinic was unavailable. In such instances, it was not possible to choose a thyroid function test control. A match on final diagnosis was chosen as a suitable alternative. The dose in this study ranged from under 10 cGy to over 2000 cGy with a median of 35 cGy. Four carcinomas were confirmed in the exposed patients, and one was confirmed in the combined controls for an odds ratio of 2.96 with 95% confidence limits of 0.31 to 70.0. There were eight con- firmed benign thyroid tumors in the exposed group and two in the com- bined controls for an odds ratio of 2.96 with 95% confidence limits from 0.59 to 20.2. Since both of these confidence intervals include unity, the odds ratios are obviously not statistically significant (8). This observation is verified by a test of the rates as a function of person-years given in Klein- baum et al. (9). The small size of the study cohorts contributed to the failure of these tests to achieve statistical significance, and the authors feel that the study should be completed to determine if the observed approxi- mate threefold increase in relative risk is maintained. There has been discussion about the controls included in this study and their comparability to the exposed subjects. There was some limited matching by group in age (within 5 years), race, sex, and date of entry. In the early part of the study, sibling controls were solicited, but there were too few of these available to do a meaningful comparison. The major concern with the controls is that they may not match the exposed patients who may exhibit a selection bias. While it is true that there were probably unstated reasons why one patient received "''I and another did not, it is unclear whether such a potential bias is sufficiently large enough to disqual- ify the control group. Furthermore, it is equally unclear whether the use of population incidence rates as a basis for comparison is any less biased. Perhaps the question of the adequacy of population rates as controls should be further explored by the attendees of this conference. Can ade- quate adjustments be made to those rates to make them reflect the charac- teristics of the exposed population? This question has been debated fre- quently in the past and will be debated frequently in the future. It appears from the most recent animal study that 131'I induces thyroid carcinoma as effectively as X rays in doses under 1000 cGy. The period of high thyroid activity, prepuberty through adolescence, appears to be espe- cially sensitive for tumor induction. Other human studies will be discussed in the next paper, but the study reported here observed an increased odds ratio which was not statistically significant. It remains to be seen just what the risk of ''3I is for inducing thyroid cancer in the human. REFERENCES 1. I.

ELAINE RON, Radiation Epidemiol- ogy Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. Although external radiation is known to cause benign and malignant thyroid neoplasia in humans at doses as low as 10 cGy (1), there has been little evidence to suggest that 13'I has a similar neoplastic potential (2, 3). Recently, attention has been focused on the possible carcinogenic effects of "'3 as a result of the April 1986 accident at Chernobyl, during which substantial areas of Europe were exposed to large quantities of radioactive iodine. The potential late health effects of ''I exposure continue to cause public concern because of its wide use in medicine and the recent acknowl- edgment that residents living near nuclear facilities were exposed to 1311 releases. Studies on the effects of '1'I include patients exposed to high-dose therapeutic 1311 or low-dose diagnostic 131I, populations accidentally ex- posed to radioiodides from nuclear weapons testing fallout, and popula- tions exposed to radioactive emissions from nuclear installations. The need for additional human data was emphasized in Public Law 97-414 (Orphan Drug Act), Section 7, which called for more research ". . . to develop valid and credible assessments of risks of thyroid cancer that are associated with thyroid doses of Iodine 131." While there have been case reports of thyroid cancer occurring subse- quent to large doses of '3'I treatment for hyperthyroidism (4-6), the few epidemiologic studies have largely been negative (7-9). In the United States a large collaborative study of 36,000 hyperthyroid patients treated with 13'I, thyroidectomy, or antithyroid medication between 1946 and 1964 was conducted. After a mean follow-up of 8 years for the radioiodine patients and 12 years for the surgery patients, no significant excess of thy- roid cancer was observed among the 131I-treated patients (7). Hoffman et</page><page sequence="26">ABSTRACTS 361 al. (8) further evaluated a small subgroup of this population (3146 women treated at the Mayo Clinic). Three cases of thyroid cancer occurred among the '31I-treated patients compared to 0.8 expected based on Connecticut incidence rates. This difference was not statistically significant. Only one thyroid cancer developed among the surgery patients, although 2.2 were expected. In the most recent follow-up of a study conducted in Sweden, more than 10,000 hyperthyroid patients treated with between 6,000 and 10,000 cGy per treatment of radioactive iodine were evaluated (9, 10). Mean follow-up was 14.5 years, although some patients were followed for up to 25 years. No significant excess of thyroid cancers was observed. Thus far, knowledge about the risks of thyroid cancer following diagnos- tic doses of ''I is largely based on an investigation of 35,000 patients conducted in Sweden by Holm et al. (11). Patients examined with 31'I for suspected thyroid disorders between 1951 and 1969 were identified from seven oncology centers and were followed for an average of 20 years via record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry. The mean age at expo- sure was 44 years, but about 2000 patients were under 20 years of age at the time of examination. For the period of 5 or more years after exposure, 50 thyroid cancers were observed yielding a relative risk of 1.27 (95% confi- dence interval 0.94-1.67), although the mean thyroid dose was 50 cGy. The only significant risk was found among a small subgroup of men aged 50-74 years old at the time of their first examination. The almost 2000 persons examined before age 20 had a risk of 1.8, but this risk estimate was unstable and the 95% confidence interval was extremely wide (0.22-6.63). Allowing for a 10-year latent period, the relative risk for the total cohort dropped to 0.93. A study of patients exposed to either diagnostic or therapeutic '31I con- ducted in Homburg, Germany, compared thyroid cancer prevalence in the exposed patient groups to that found in the general population (12). Thy- roid cancer prevalence was lower in the 1183 patients treated with '31I for hyperthyroidism than the unexposed population. Diagnostic exposures among approximately 14,000 patients were evaluated by the number of 131I uptake examinations. The occurrence of thyroid cancer was similar for the exposed and nonexposed and there was no indication of a dose re- sponse. Overall, findings from medical exposures are in accord with the view that "'I is considerably less efficient in inducing radiogenic thyroid cancer than external radiation. In 1954, a nuclear weapons test in the Pacific Ocean accidentally ex- posed people living in the Marshall Islands to large doses of inhaled and ingested short and long-lived radioisotopes, as well as external gamma radiation (13-15). The Marshall Islanders exhibited an excess of thyroid carcinoma, as well as other thyroid disorders at thyroid doses estimated as between 7 and 14 Gy for young children and approximately 20 Gy for infants (13). Lessard et al. (14) compared the risk of short-lived internal emitters and external radiation exposure and concluded that the internal irradiation produced less thyroid cancer than did external radiation among the 85 children less than 10 years of age at the time of exposure. In contrast, for those exposed after 10 years of age, internal irradiation caused more thyroid cancer than external radiation. Hamilton et al. (15) recently con- ducted a new study which included many atolls previously thought to be unexposed. They reported that there was a linear dose-response relation- ship with a risk estimate of 11 nodules per 106 PY-cGy. The study of the Marshall Islanders is one of the few which provides convincing evidence that radioiodines might induce thyroid cancer. However, these data alone are insufficient to establish such a relationship because the number of cancers was small and the thyroid radiation dose was from 'a'I in addition to 0I, 1331, I, and external radiation. In fact, only 10-20% of the thyroid dose came from '3aI. Studies of persons living close to the Nevada nuclear weapons testing sites have assessed the association between thyroid disease and radioactive fallout (16). Over 100 weapons tests, carried out between 1951 and 1958, deposited radioactive fallout in areas of Utah and Nevada. Clinical thyroid examinations of approximately 1000 children living in exposed Utah counties (estimated mean dose was approximately 120 cGy) and close to 4000 children residing in nonexposed neighboring counties showed no evidence of an association between thyroid cancer and "L'I fallout. Bowlt and Tiplady correlated 1291 activity in thyroid tissue taken at nec- ropsy and thyroid cancer registrations in the area around the Sellafield fuel reprocessing plant in England. They found that activity of 1291, a long-lived radionuclide which can be used as a surrogate measure of 131I activity, decreased with increasing distanced from Sellafield (P &lt; 0.001). However, thyroid cancer registration was negatively correlated with proximity to the plant (P = 0.0007). While these studies preclude firm conclusions because they included few children, many of the subjects had underlying thyroid disease, and follow- up periods were fairly short, they provide strong evidence that, on a Gy- for-Gy basis, '31I alone is less carcinogenic than external radiation (2). Possible reasons for the difference in the carcinogenic effectiveness of "131 and external radiation include the extreme nonuniformity of the "31I dose distribution within the thyroid gland and the protracted nature of 1311 which might allow radiation damage to be repaired. Because external radia- tion is delivered in minutes, it has been estimated that the dose rate may be 4 to 60 times greater than an equivalent 131I dose which is delivered over many days. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the more extensive cell killing caused by '13I therapy may also be related to a lower risk of thyroid cancer. A contrary view was expressed by Laird (17). Based on a meta analysis which included one study of persons exposed to diagnostic 31I, one experimental study of rats exposed to '31I, and six studies of humans exposed to external radiation, she reported that the evidence was not strong enough to conclude that the tumorigenic effectiveness of '3I differs from that of external radiation. To clarify further the relationship between internally deposited radioio- dides and thyroid cancer, several new investigations of medically and envi- ronmentally exposed populations have been, or are being, initiated. A second follow-up of the United States collaborative study of 36,000 Ameri- can hyperthyroid patients is nearing completion, and when finished the mean follow-up will be 20 years. Studies of persons examined with diag- nostic "'3I are now underway in both Israel and Yugoslavia. Together, these two studies will include approximately 50,000 people, and it is esti- mated that about 3000 will have been exposed before age 20 years. The German study of patients exposed to diagnostic or therapeutic 1311 is con- tinuing. An assessment of clinically detectable thyroid nodularity follow- ing exposure to diagnostic 13'I will begin shortly. A new evaluation of people living in areas of Utah exposed to "3'I fallout is now underway. Detailed dose estimates are being calculated and will be related to thyroid neoplasia incidence and prevalence. Results are expected within 1 year. Persons living in the vicinity of the Hanford nuclear installation are also currently under study. Individual thyroid doses will be reconstructed and an epidemiologic survey of thyroid disease is being conducted. Finally, a study of thyroid disease occurring among persons exposed to fallout from Chernobyl is in the planning phase. It is expected that the information gained from these new and ongoing investigations will provide additional quantitative data on the effectiveness of 13'1 in causing thyroid tumors and on the possible modifying effects of age at exposure.

Case-Control Studies of Cancers Related to Dental and Medical Radi- ography. SUSAN PRESTON-MARTIN, University of Southern California. Case-control studies of radiogenic tumors that investigate diagnostic ra- diography as an exposure of interest and are conducted in geographically defined U.S. populations have two basic weaknesses: first, information about exposure is derived primarily from interview, and second, no rec- ords exist of radiation doses delivered. Nonetheless, we have conducted several such studies in Los Angeles County. Various ways used to get around the inherent problems will be discussed in the context of two series of studies: studies of brain and salivary gland tumors in which dental X rays are an exposure of interest and studies of adult-onset myeloid leuke- mia and prior radiographic examinations of the trunk such as back X rays and gastrointestinal series. A series of case-control interview studies of primary brain tumors diag- nosed among Los Angeles County residents during the 1970s and 1980s asked about prior radiography of the head as one of many factors investi- gated. Subjects with a history of multiple full-mouth dental X-ray examina- tions were found to have increased risk of subtentorial meningioma in separate studies in women (1) and men (2), and brain tumors of all histo- logic types among young people aged 15-24 (3). In a recent study of pri- mary brain tumors in men, a history of frequent dental X-ray examina- tions increased risk of acoustic neuroma (4), meningioma, and glioma (5). One of these brain tumor studies attempted to validate interview informa- tion on exposure and no dosimetry was done. A case-control study of tumors of the parotid gland (about 80% of all salivary gland tumors arise in the parotid gland) focused on dental X rays. The interviewer obtained a detailed lifetime history of dental care includ- ing dentists visited, radiographs taken, and conditions treated (6). We de- veloped and used an extensive system of probes designed to help subjects recall this information (6). Questions about medical X-ray exposure (both therapeutic and diagnostic), job exposure to radiation, tobacco use, history of cancer and diseases of the parotid gland, and family history of cancer or parotid tumors were also included. We tried to establish not only the fact of exposure for each factor, but also its chronology and an estimate of the total amount of exposure. For each type of diagnostic exposure, we tried to establish both the number of visits during which X rays were taken and the number of radiographs taken on each visit. A quarter (102 pairs) of the 408 pairs in the study also participated in a validation study in which interview information was compared to information recorded in patients' dental charts; interview information was found to be unbiased and accurate enough to be used as the basis of case-control comparisons (6). We used all published dosimetry surveys on dental and medical radiogra- phy to the head to derive a model to estimate parotid exposure from each major type of radiographic procedure (7). All point estimates (year of publication and parotid dose) for each procedure were plotted and a regres- sion curve relating parotid dose to calendar year (from 1920 to present) was fitted. We derived separate curves for six common radiographic exami- nations of the head (three dental and three medical): intraoral radiogra- phy-full-mouth examinations; panoramic examinations; cephalometric examinations; skull series; sinus series; and computerized tomographic scans. For example, for full-mouth examinations (15 radiographs exposed on average) we used those surveys that measured both skin exposure and dose to the mid-parotid gland to estimate that the average dose to each parotid gland was 1.19% of the average skin exposure per film. This con- stant was then applied to other surveys, all of which measured average skin exposure per film. Doses from periapical and bitewing radiographs were calculated using a fixed fraction of the dose from a full-mouth series. The exposure was assumed to be 4/15 of that from a full-mouth series of bite- wing examinations (four radiographs exposed). A similar method was used to estimate parotid dose for each of the other radiographies. Malignant tumors of the parotid gland were related to total cumulative parotid dose from radiography and radiation therapy combined (P trend &lt; 0.01), diagnostic radiography alone (P trend = 0.02), and dental radiog- raphy alone (Ptrend = 0.05) (7). Similar relationships were seen for benign parotid tumors but trends were not statistically significant. Dental X rays accounted for 85% of cumulative parotid dose from diagnostic radiogra- phy. Three factors (parotid exposure from prior radiation therapy, parotid exposure from diagnostic radiography, and a personal history of cancer) each had a significant independent effect on risk of developing a malignant tumor of the parotid gland. The attributable risk (AR) for these three fac- tors combined is 36% and the AR for therapeutic and diagnostic radiation combined is 28%. The association of each of the three factors with benign tumors was in the same direction but was considerably weaker, and none had a significant effect.</page><page sequence="28">ABSTRACTS 363 A case-control study of Los Angeles patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) found that during the 3-20 years prior to the year of diagnosis, more cases than controls had X-ray examinations of the back, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and kidneys; and cases more often had GI track and back radiographs taken on multiple occasions. A total of 5 cases and 0 controls had GI radiography done on four or more separate occasions, and 11 cases and 1 control had back radiographs taken on five or more occa- sions. Estimates of bone marrow exposure doses from various radiographic procedures were derived primarily from published estimates based on do- simetry models which calculate mean active bone marrow dose to adults from diagnostic radiography and fluoroscopy as practiced in the United States in 1970 (9). Other published data were used to estimate bone marrow exposure doses from radioisotope scans and CAT scans (10, 11). We devised a look-up table for procedures which assigned the exposure dose indicated for each of several radiographic examinations, including the following: skull, 75 mrad; teeth, 9 mrad; chest, 10 mrad; chest fluoroscopy, 44 mrad; cervical spine, 52 mrad; stomach and upper GI series with bar- ium swallow, 535 mrad; lower GI series with barium enema, 875 mrad. These estimates are likely to have systematically underestimated patient exposure since, in practice, radiographic technique is commonly less than optimal and it is often necessary to repeat the radiographic procedure on the same visit. We did not attempt to estimate exposure from background sources such as cosmic radiation (which relates primarily to altitude) or from any sources other than those associated with medical and dental care or occupation. The odds ratio for exposure to 0-0.99, 1.0-9.99, 10.00-19.99, and &gt;20.0 Gy in the 3-20 years prior to diagnosis were 1.0, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.4, respectively (P for the highest exposure category &lt; 0.05). The association was strongest for the period 6-10 years prior to diagnosis, and the effect of radiation exposure during this period remained significant after consider- ation of other risk factors in a logistic regression analysis. It was estimated that 23% of cases were attributable to exposure to diagnostic X rays during the period 3-20 years prior to the date of diagnosis of the case (17% during the 6-10 years prior to diagnosis). These recent findings support the association of adult-onset myeloge- nous leukemia (ML) with certain types of radiographic examinations and with multiple such examinations. The findings are similar to those of the case-control study in New Zealand which found that risk of ML increased with the frequency of X-ray examination of the back and GI tract (12). Similarly, the British and tri-state leukemia studies found that patients with ML were more likely than controls to have had multiple radiographic examinations (13, 14). A study that was without positive risk findings involved a smaller num- ber of patients (63 patients with ML, including some children) and used nonleukemia patients as controls. The controls were matched to the cases by having visited the same clinic at two distinct times (the year when the patient was diagnosed with ML and the year when the patient first visited the clinic before the diagnosis of ML) (15). This algorithm for control selection may have introduced a serious bias, since controls selected from among repeat clinical patients are likely to have received more medical attention (including more X-ray examinations) than the general popula- tion. We are currently conducting a case-control interview study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Los Angeles County which will include valida- tion of interview information by a comparison with medical charts; dosim- etry will be similar to that done in the CML study. X-ray procedures for different parts of the body will be queried separately, and procedures will be identified by name and described. An extensive series of probes has been devised to prompt recall. Studying the acute form of this disease introduces additional problems. AML is a disease characterized by rapid onset and rapid progression. Etio- logically relevant exposures are more recent, but care must still be taken to exclude radiographic examinations for leukemia-related complaints. Pa- tients are very sick and most die within a year of diagnosis. In order not to have a study whose participants are mostly patients who are less sick and survive longer, we will include interviews with proxy respondents. When- ever an eligible proxy (someone who lived with the subject for at least 6 of the 10 years before the diagnosis year) is available, we will attempt to interview him, and we will do this interview before the interview with the corresponding case or control. Issues that will be examined include how good proxy respondents are at telling us about various types of radio- graphic procedures and how good they are at telling us about medical care providers during the 10 years preceding the diagnosis year.

GERALD DRAPER, Childhood Cancer Re- search Group, University of Oxford. We review here the rather sparse data relevant to the possibility of hu- man carcinogenesis following preconception exposure to radiation, to- gether with some possible further studies. Sources of preconception exposure in humans: (i) Nuclear industry workers. The most convincing evidence of carcinogenesis resulting from parental irradiation in humans comes from the report by Gardner et al. (1) in which an association was found between preconception exposure to radiation, as measured by film badges, and subsequent leukemia in the children of workers at the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, UK. There are no other directly comparable studies. The report of an increased incidence of retinoblastoma among the children of Navajo Indians (2) may be relevant in view of the involvement of this group in uranium-mining activities, though the paper does not provide information on parental oc- cupation. However, the fact that the excess incidence is attributable to unilateral cases, which are mainly non-heritable, suggests that they may not be the result of germ cell mutation; a raised incidence of retinoblas- toma (which seems to be largely or entirely due to the unilateral form) is found in a number of countries, mainly in Asia and Africa (3). (ii) Other occupational studies. There is no consensus concerning the importance of parental occupation in relation to childhood cancer; in par- ticular the studies that have been carried out do not in general point to radiation-related occupations as being a risk factor. Hicks et al. (4) found no overall association between parents' radiation exposure and cancer in their children; there were a number of associations between specific job-re- lated radiation exposures and specific childhood cancers but these may be chance findings. (iii) Offspring ofcancerpatients. Many cancer patients receive radiother- apy, and a number of studies of the offspring of such patients have been carried out, though these do not contain information on gonadal doses. Neither in the review by Draper (5) nor in subsequent studies of this type is there evidence of germ cell mutagenesis leading to cancer in the offspring. These studies may, however, be of limited relevance to the question of carcinogenesis as a result of parental exposure, first because of the lack of information on gonadal doses, and second because many of the offspring had not been followed up for a sufficient length of time when the results were reported. Moreover, it may be, as Gardner et al. suggested, that the risk from radiation is concentrated in a short period before conception. For cancer patients it is unlikely that children will be conceived shortly after therapy. (iv) Atomic bomb survivors. There is no evidence of an increase of leu- kemia or cancer among children born to the survivors of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6) but, again, most of these children were probably conceived some years after the radiation exposure. (v) Diagnostic radiation. There are a number of case-control studies of childhood leukemia and cancer in which preconception exposures of the parents to diagnostic X rays have been studied. A positive association between childhood leukemia and paternal exposure has been reported by Shu et al. (7). In this paper there was a significant dose-response effect taking numbers of films as a measure of dose, but no information was provided on the sites of the X rays or on gonadal exposure. Graham et al. (8) found a small excess risk "of borderline significance" for preconception exposure of fathers, but again this related to X rays at all sites. Kneale and Stewart (9) found no excess for X rays at abdominal sites. Thus no clear picture of the effects of paternal exposure to diagnostic radiation prior to conception emerges. The same is true for maternal preconception diagnos- tic radiation in these papers and in Shiono et al. (10). It has been claimed that childhood cancer rates are related to levels of terrestrial 'y radiation (11) or to radon levels (12). If there is in fact a risk associated with back- ground radiation it may be attributable to germ cell effects on the parents. Animal experiments. Tumors including leukemia have been induced in the progeny of irradiated mice in a large series of experiments carried out by Nomura (13). Other related results are reviewed by Vorobtsova (14). Possible future studies: Design and methodology. Future studies in the UK are likely to include cohort studies of offspring both of cancer survi- vors and of radiation workers. Two different ways of carrying out such studies are envisaged: one method is to use a questionnaire study, asking about children born to radiation workers or cancer survivors together with radiation exposure records of workers or medical records of cancer patients (though these are unlikely to contain estimates of gonadal doses). An alter- native method is to use computer record linkage. In Britain it is proposed to link the national computer files of radiation workers to the national registry of childhood tumors which includes names of patients and covers a period of about 30 years for cancer registrations and nearly 40 years for deaths. Unfortunately the file of radiation workers does not contain infor- mation on the workers' children and the childhood cancer file does not contain information on parents; it is therefore planned to link these files by first linking the childhood cancer file to birth records which do contain identifying information on parents. Since this method will not provide information on the total number of children born to the workers and thus will not enable cancer rates to be computed, the analysis will consist in comparing number of cases of child- hood cancer among workers in different exposure groups and, if possible, in taking a control sample of children without cancer and comparing the numbers of cancer and control children matched to the radiation workers' file. Similar methods could be used for children born to any group for which there is thought to be an increased risk of cancer in the offspring. REFERENCES 1. M. J. GARDNER, M. P. SNEE, A. J.

GARDNER, University of Southampton. Introduction. This paper reviews published studies of childhood cancer rates around nuclear installations and considers some of the problems and possibilities for interpretation. Each country where studies have been re- ported will be discussed, with findings for the United Kingdom presented first as these are the most detailed available. The results ofepidemiological cohort and case-control studies near the Sellafield nuclear site are outlined. Geographical studies. United Kingdom. Since 1983 there has been con- cern about the levels of cancer, and in particular leukemia, among children living in the vicinity of nuclear installations in the United Kingdom. This concern was largely aroused by the television documentary "Windscale: The Nuclear Laundry" shown during that year which suggested high child- hood leukemia rates near the Sellafield nuclear power and waste reprocess- ing plant. An independent inquiry confirmed that there was cause for concern from an examination of routinely collected cancer registration and mortality data (1). Following that there have been exhaustive analyses of relevant information around most of the British nuclear sites. The find- ings mentioned below were examined in more detail by Gardner (2). In outline, leukemia has been shown to have an excess among individ- uals under 25 years of age at diagnosis of some fivefold or more around both Sellafield and Dounreay-the other British nuclear site with a waste reprocessing facility. The excesses are based on small numbers (typically under 10 cases) and the size of the excesses depends on which periods, age groups, geographical areas, and diagnostic classifications are used. How- ever, when put into the context of other areas of the country, the levels do seem raised even if not totally extreme. Excesses of childhood leukemia of a much lesser degree, if at all, have been shown around nuclear sites other than Sellafield and Dounreay. In general, relative excesses of the order of some 15% have been reported. These relate either to collective sites such as Aldermaston, Burghfield, and Harwell or to groups of nuclear installations such as those started up before 1955. A regression analysis adjusting for social class, urban/rural status, population size, and health authority region did not modify markedly these latter findings. Canada. An initial-phase study of leukemia incidence and mortality among children under the age of 5 years around five nuclear facilities in Ontario has been reported (3). The results are based on relatively small numbers of cases around four of the individual sites, but collectively there is an excess of some 20% in leukemia rates although the confidence inter- vals are wide. A second-phase study is extending the age range to those under 15 years old and results are expected (V. Elaguppillai, personal com- munication). France. The results of a study around the La Hague nuclear waste repro- cessing center in Normandy of leukemia mortality in persons under the age of 25 years have been reported (4). This study again was based on small numbers but does not show any indications of excess leukemia deaths by age group, calendar period, and distance from the plant. Overall there was a deficit of about 10% below the expected numbers of deaths. The authors comment that they have not been able to study incidence rates. A further study around other French nuclear facilities is forthcoming (K. Hill, in preparation). United States. An analysis of cancer rates around 61 U.S. nuclear instal- lations will soon be available (S. Jablon, in press), but a number of reports around specific facilities have already been published. First, in a study around the nuclear weapons Rocky Flats site in Denver it was suggested that there was an excess cancer risk among the population living down- wind of the installation (5), but its findings are controversial (6, 7). Second, a study around the San Onofre nuclear power plant in California reported that rates of childhood leukemia were no higher in neighboring areas than farther away (8). Third, a study from Massachusetts reported higher leuke- mia registration rates in adults but not children during 1982-1984 in an area around a nuclear power plant in Plymouth (9). Fourth, Goldsmith (10) has presented data for 1950-1979 for counties around the Hanford and Oak Ridge nuclear installations showing an excess leukemia mortality among children 0-9 years old in the earlier years although not more re- cently, but this study has received some critical comment in relation to the population data used (11). Other investigations. In England the geographical analyses around Sella- field have been followed by conventional epidemiological studies to inves- tigate the cases in more detail. Cohort studies. Cohort studies of children both born and attending schools in the village of Seascale, near Sellafield, where the geographical excess was concentrated have been reported (12, 13). These studies con- firmed a raised rate of cancer among the village children, but it was found only among those children born there and not among those children born outside and moving in to attend the village schools. Case-control studies. A case-control study of leukemia and lymphoma among young people in the health authority area including Sellafield has been reported (14, 15). The main finding was a strong statistical relation- ship between the raised incidence of childhood leukemia and their father's recorded external ionizing radiation dose during employment at the plant before the child's conception. The association can explain statistically the observed geographical excess. REFERENCES 1. D. BLACK, Investigation ofthe Possible Increased Incidence of Cancer in West Cumbria. HMSO, London, 1984. 2.

DISCUSSION SEYMOUR JABLON, National Cancer Institute, NIH We have been fortunate tonight to have had presentations concerning two very important and relatively new ideas: that radiation doses to the fetus, especially during the 8th to the 15th weeks of gestation, can have a lasting effect on the development of the brain, and that rather moderate doses to males can result in leukemia in offspring conceived subsequent to the radiation dose. Dr. Schull has been developing the data concerning radiation effects on the fetal brain for several years and presents a convincing scenario con- cerning the way in which the effect is produced. We are accustomed to thinking of radiation effects in terms of damage to the genetic apparatus of individual cells which may manifest itself many years later in the form of cancer or as the killing or sterilization of many cells, leading to organ failure, as of the hematopoietic system. The novelty that Jack Schull pre- sents to us is an effect that is not, directly, cell killing, but instead disloca- tion of the program that causes cells to migrate from the location in which they are generated to the sites in which they must ultimately reside if they are to function properly. This is, so far as I know, a novel radiation effect. It appears to be a linear function of dose, at least over the dose range that can be evaluated, as measured by intelligence tests and evaluation of school performance. Whether the linearity of the response holds at the very lowest dose levels, below 0.1 Sv, cannot be decided by appeal to the data. As is true for radiation carcinogenesis, we shall never have data sufficient to answer the questions concerning the effect of very low doses, especially at low dose rates. The answers will come eventually, not from epidemiological studies, but from radiobiology. When we understand just what is the mechanism by which radiation exerts its influence, it will then be possible to deduce what the effect of small radiation doses may be, even at background levels. Meanwhile, Dr. Schull gives us another reason for the protection of pregnant women from exposure to radiation. I do not know how the obli- gation of employers to protect pregnant women from occupational expo- sures is to be squared with the laws that forbid discrimination in employ- ment. This is, however, an issue that our society must face, not only with respect to ionizing radiation but also in relation to many other toxic sub- stances. Dr. Martin Gardner has described a series of studies that are aimed at elucidating the puzzle concerning the excessive occurrence of childhood leukemia and lymphoma around the Sellafield complex. These excesses have been puzzling because careful measurements of emissions from Sella- field, considering every possible route, have failed to document levels of exposure that could conceivably have been the cause of the excesses. Dr. Gardner and his colleagues have devised several epidemiological studies, both cohort and case-control, in an effort to get to the bottom of the mystery. They first showed that the excesses occurred only among children who were born in the area, not in a roughly equal number who had been born elsewhere but had attended school in Seascale. A careful case-control study excluded a variety of possible causes such as exposures received while playing on the beach or consuming possibly contaminated foods, including shellfish. One factor did stand out: four of the cases of leukemia were in children whose fathers were employed at Seascale and who had monitored radiation doses exceeding 0.1 Sv (10 rem) before con- ception, and who also had more than 0.01 Sv in the 6 months prior to conception. It is suggested that there may have been genetic changes caused by radiation in the fathers' sperm, leading to leukemia in the off- spring. This suggestion demands careful examination. No such effect has been seen among the offspring of fathers exposed to the atomic bombs in Hiro- shima or Nagasaki. Although many children were born in those cities whose fathers had been exposed to the bombs, there were very few whose fathers had been exposed within 3 months prior to conception. This indi- cates that if, as suggested, the effect is genetic, it must be limited to a short time window of at most 2 or 3 months prior to conception. There are other reasons to reserve judgment concerning the genetic hypothesis. It seems strange that an adverse effect mediated by genetic damage in sperm would be limited to the induction of leukemia or lymphoma. Other cancers and, in fact, congenital anomalies generally would be expected to be even more frequent than leukemia in the children. Geneticists have been virtually unanimous in rejecting the idea that a genetic mechanism such as has been suggested could be responsible for the finding. Dr. Gardner and his colleagues are continuing their studies, and we must all earnestly hope that they will be successful in their attempts to explain the excesses which, at this time, simply represent a puzzle, a startling puz- zle that demands explanation. Important information will soon be available from the studies around the Dounreay reprocessing plant in Scotland where an excess of childhood leukemia similar to that near Sellafield has been found. If, in that instance too, the fathers had relatively large preconception radiation doses, that would increase the plausibility of the genetic hypothesis. But, whatever the outcome of the Dounreay study, the Sellafield results, which achieve statis- tical significance at a very small level of probability, will continue to de- mand a satisfactory explanation. Health Effects from Whole-Body Irradiation during Development in Beagles: Studies at Colorado State University. STEVEN A. BENJAMIN, Colorado State University (with G. M. Angleton, A. C. Lee, W. J. Saunders, and J. S. Williams). The Collaborative Radiological Health Laboratory (CRHL) was estab- lished in 1962 for the express purpose of conducting research to help deter- mine the lifetime hazards associated with prenatal and early postnatal ex- posure to ionizing radiation. The primary effort has been a life span study of a moderately large, long-lived mammal, the beagle dog, exposed at one of several ages during development to relatively discrete doses of external , radiation. The major experiment was begun in 1967. Animals received a single, bilateral, whole-body exposure to 6Co y radiation at 8 (preimplantation), 28 (embryonic), or 55 (late fetal) days postcoitus (dpc), or at 2 (neonatal), 70 (juvenile), or 365 (young adult) days postpartum (dpp). Exposure times were a total of 10 min for either 20 or 100 R midline in-air exposures. Control animals were sham-irradiated. Both sexes were equally repre- sented. The mean absorbed dose for the 20-R exposure groups was 16.3 cGy (range in individual dogs, 15.1-17.8) and for the 100-R group was 82.6 cGy (range in individual dogs, 74.6-93.8) (1, 2). A total of 1680 beagles were entered into the main life span experiment.</page><page sequence="32">ABSTRACTS 367 There were 120 dogs in each of the 16.3-cGy dose groups exposed at 8, 28, or 55 dpc, or 2 dpp. There were 120 dogs in each of the 82.6-cGy groups exposed at 8, 28, or 55 dpc or 2 or 70 dpp. There were 240 dogs given 82.6 cGy at 365 dpp. There were 360 controls. Of the 1680 dogs, 337 were sacrificed at 5, 8, or 11 years of age for evaluation of age-related disease incidence. The remaining 1343 were allowed to live out their natural life spans and died or were killed because of terminal illness. Parallel short- term experiments were performed using a wider range of doses (group means of 0-383 cGy) and ages at exposure (8, 28, 35, 40, 45, or 55 dpc) in which dogs were sacrificed at up to 4 years of age. A variety of responses have been evaluated including end points of sur- vival, growth and development, pathophysiological responses, and disease incidence patterns. The last dogs in the study died during 1989, and the full evaluation of the pathological changes in all cases is not complete. The data reported here, especially for carcinogenesis, represent an interim anal- ysis, and the final results could change with the completion of the pathol- ogy evaluations. The selected results presented here either are related to current human health concerns or represent potential confounding factors in the analysis of the CRHL study. Whole litters were entered into the life span study at 14 days of age. Litters of size less than three at 14 days or greater than eight at birth were excluded from the study. All beagles in a given litter were assigned to the same dose group. The analysis of mortality data thus has two components. The first component involves the use of whelping data and the mortality data through 14 days of age. The second component is a conditional analy- sis of mortality data subsequent to 14 days of age with the condition being all subjects were alive at this age. In the life span study, radiation effects on prenatal and early neonatal mortality were evident (3). A decrease in whelping rates was observed for female breeders irradiated at 8 dpc, and there was a decrease in litter sizes from female breeders irradiated at 8 or 28 dpc. Both of these findings indicate increased embryonic mortality. A significant increase in neonatal mortality up to 14 days of age was observed for dogs exposed at 8 or 28 dpc. There appeared to be a difference in the mortality rates between sexes. Between the ages of 8 and 12, the mortality rate for females was greater than that for males. Subsequent to 12 years of age, the mortality rate for females became less than that for males. There was no apparent effect of radiation exposure on survival probabilities in the males. The females, however, showed an increase in mortality rates after 12 years of age for groups irradiated at 28 or 55 dpc. With respect to growth and development, birth weights were reduced significantly in dogs exposed in utero at 28 or 55 dpc. Body size was re- duced in dogs up to I year of age after exposures at 28 or 55 dpc or 2 dpp as measured by weight and skeletal growth. Changes in femur length were best described by a linear response with the decrease per unit dose being greatest for exposures at 28 dpc. Brain weight decreased significantly with increasing dose up to 383 cGy in dogs irradiated at 28 or 55 dpc or at 2 dpp, again with the 28-dpc exposures being most damaging (4). In life span dogs exposed at 28 dpc and followed for up to 11 years, there was significant reduction in brain weight at 82.6 cGy. In these and other studies using exposures at 35 dpc, there was evidence for a negative linear dose response for brain weight and effects were seen at doses as low as 10 cGy. For comparison with data on childhood cancer after prenatal irradia- tion, tumors occurring in young dogs in the life span experiment were evaluated. Up to 4 years of age, 18 dogs had neoplasms diagnosed, 2 of these being in controls. The predominance of tumors (56%) occurred in dogs irradiated at 55 dpc (33%) and 2 dpp (23%), in the perinatal period. This was striking in that each group comprised only 14.3% of the experi- mental population. Of the malignancies, 5 of 7 also occurred in 28.6% of the dogs irradiated in the perinatal period. No malignancies were seen in the controls. Furthermore, 4 fatal cancers were observed in perinatally irradiated dogs, all under 2 years of age. Analysis for tumor onset rate (5) revealed a significant positive linear trend with dose for dogs irradiated in the late fetal or neonatal stages (6). An analysis has been performed for fatal cancer rates in dogs up to 16 years of age (5). Combining all fatal malignancies, once again the dogs irradiated at either 55 dpc or 2 dpp had the strongest evidence for positive trend with increasing dose, supporting the sensitivity noted at the early times after exposure. Trends for an increased risk in dogs irradiated at 8 dpc or 365 dpp were weaker, but still significant. Although the findings did not reach significance at the 5% confidence level, the fatal cancer rates showed a positive trend for the two remaining groups exposed at 28 dpc or 70 dpp. Thus irradiation at all ages was associated with increased risk. The risk of fatal malignancy after irradiation was greater in females than in males. Dogs in all groups showed an increase in a broad spectrum of fatal neoplasms. With respect to some of the most common canine fatal neo- plasms, dogs exposed at 55 dpc had significant increases in lymphoid neo- plasia and dogs exposed at 8 or 55 dpc had increases in hemangiosarcomas. There was no evidence of an increased risk for fatal mammary gland neo- plasia after irradiation. Dogs exposed at 70 dpp, in the juvenile stage, had a significant increase in fatal thyroid cancer. Analysis of dogs up to 16 years of age has revealed an increase in all thyroid neoplasms, benign and malig- nant, in dogs irradiated in the juvenile period as well. Final analysis of the completed data sets must take several factors into account. Although the numbers of dogs in each experimental group were identical, there was embryonic loss in females irradiated to produce dogs which were entered into the life span study. It is conceivable that the dogs whelped after preimplantation (8 dpc) or embryonic (28 dpc) exposure represent a "radioresistant" population. While the magnitude of such an effect is still relatively small, this must be considered in a final evaluation of the data. Another problem for analysis relates to the genetic background of the dogs. Specific diseases which were responsible for significant mortality in the study dogs are known to be genetically determined in the CRHL colony. These include idiopathic convulsive seizures and atrophic thyroid- itis with hypothyroidism. There is suggestion that other diseases in the colony, including neoplastic diseases, may have a genetic component. Since dogs were entered into the study as whole litters, genetic factors need to be taken into account in data evaluation. Finally, it should be recognized that this study is unique among life span radiation effects studies in dogs. While this is the largest single experiment using this animal, the doses are relatively small. Most other dog studies have utilized much higher cumulative doses of protracted low-LET radia- tion or localized high-LET exposures. In those studies, significant numbers of tissue-specific, radiation-induced neoplasms have been recognizable at the higher doses. In the CRHL study, the low-dose, whole-body 7 expo- sures can be expected to yield only modest increases in a variety of neo- plasms. Thus, despite the size of the study, the statistical power to identify increases in specific tumor types may be lacking except for the most com- mon of the canine neoplasms. Acknowledgment.

Description of the studies. Analyses based on data from two experimen- tal studies conducted at Pacific Northwest Laboratory are presented. The first is a life span study of beagle dogs exposed to inhaled plutonium (1-4). The objectives of this study are, first, to determine the biological effects in dogs of inhaled plutonium at various dose levels, and, second, to obtain dose-effect relationship data that can be used to estimate the risk of these effects in humans. In this study, 18-month-old beagle dogs were exposed by inhalation to six different dose levels and three different types of plutonium. The lowest level corresponds to the maximum permissible burden for a plutonium worker, while the highest level is a level at which radiation pneumonitis is likely to cause early death. 239PuO2 was chosen because it is the form of plutonium to which people working in nuclear fuel processing and storage industries may be exposed. 238PuO2 and 239Pu(N03)4 were chosen because they produce different spatial and temporal distributions of radiation dose, and thus can provide information on the influence of these factors on risk. The second experiment is a life span study of rats exposed by inhalation to radon and radon progeny (5, 6). Although human data on radon risks are available from studies of miners, animal experimental studies provide important supplementary information. Because the measurement of expo- sure characteristics is more precise and because confounding factors are better controlled in experimental than in epidemiologic studies, animal studies may provide a more reliable assessment of the dependence of risks on radon-progeny exposure. Experimental data can also provide informa- tion on the dependence of risks on radon-progeny exposure rate, unat- tached fraction, disequilibrium, and concomitant exposures to cigarette smoke. Rat exposures discussed in this presentation were initiated at about 90 days of age. Cumulative radon-progeny exposure levels were 320, 640, 1280, 2560, and 5120 WLM for animals exposed at 50 and 500 WLM per week, and 320 WLM for animals exposed at 5 WLM per week. The rats in this experiment were males and were not exposed to cigarette smoke. Statistical methods. The analyses to be presented address lung tumor risks in these animals. The objectives of analyses of both the plutonium and the radon data were similar. In both cases, we were interested in quan- tifying lung cancer risks, examining the shape of the dose-response curves, and examining the pattern of risks over time. We were also interested in understanding the modifying effects of the different isotopes and chemical forms of plutonium, and the modifying effects of radon exposure rates. In both the plutonium and the radon studies, it was important to use methods that appropriately accounted for time-related factors and competing risks. In choosing methods for analyzing these data, an important consider- ation is that results be in a form that can be readily compared with results of analyses of relevant human epidemiologic data. Analyses of human epidemiologic data have generally modeled the hazard, or age-specific risk, as a function of dose and other factors. The model that has been most commonly used for human analyses is a relative risk regression model in which the hazard is a linear-quadratic function of risk, and in which the baseline risk has been handled nonparametrically by introducing separate coefficients for each age group, or, more generally, for each stratum. For analyses of the animal data, we have used a similar model, but have substituted a Weibull function for the separate baseline coefficients. This substitution was made in part because we do not have the large number of subjects with minimal exposure that are usually available in human epide- miologic studies, and we do not have vital statistics to draw on. For this reason, it is often desirable to present risks in absolute rather than in rela- tive terms, and the Weibull model we have used allows this. With appropriate parameterization and scaling of age, risk coefficients can be interpreted as the cumulative hazards to the average life spans of control animals associated with a specified exposure scenario. For low doses, these cumulative hazards are a close approximation to the lifetime risks. In these experiments, both inhaled plutonium and inhaled radon deliver dose to the lung over time, and dose (or exposure) needs to be treated as a time-dependent variable in analyses of these data. In analyzing experimental data, it is important to take into account the context of observation, that is, whether tumors were the cause of death, discovered incidentally at necropsy, or discovered prior to death (7). For the dogs, several kinds of information relevant to establishing the time of the tumor and the context of observation are available. Available data include results of radiographs, date of death, whether a tumor was ob- served at death, and whether the tumor was judged by the pathologist to cause the death of the animal. There were some small tumors observed at necropsy that were not seen on radiographs and were not judged to cause the death of the animal. For the dog study, there are three possible hazards that could be consid- ered for modeling: the risk of tumor observable at necropsy, the risk of tumor observable on a radiograph, and the risk of tumor causing death of the animal. The times to tumor associated with each of these hazards differ. Three approaches have been considered in analyzing lung tumor risks. In the first, we included only tumors judged to cause death in the animal, with the time to tumor considered to be the time of death. In the second, we included only tumors seen on radiographs, with the time to tumor estimated as the average of the time of the first positive radiograph and the last negative radiograph. The third approach was similar to the second except that all tumors were included; for tumors not seen on radio- graphs, the time to tumor was estimated by making the fairly strong as- sumption that the interval between this time and the time the tumor would be observable at necropsy was a constant, taken to be 1 year. Another approach, which we intend to try in the future, is to treat tumors not seen on radiographs as incidental. For the radon study, there is evidence that lung tumors in rats are usually not the cause of death, but are instead found incidentally to death from other causes (5). Radiographic data are not available, and it is more diffi- cult for the pathologist to judge whether tumors are fatal or incidental. The approach we have taken is to emphasize analyses based on the assumption that all tumors are incidental, but also to consider alternative analyses based on the assumption that all tumors are fatal. The approach based on the assumption that tumors are incidental involves specifying the hazard, determining the cumulative probability of developing a tumor by a speci- fied age as a function of the parameters of the hazard, and finally modeling this new function. The approach is used rather than the nonparametric approach often used in human epidemiologic studies. Results of analyses of beagle dogs exposed to inhaled plutonium. Analy- ses were focused on comparing lung tumor risks in animals exposed to 239puO2 and to 238PuO2. The reason for interest in this comparison is that the specific activity of 238puO2 is much higher than that for 239PuO2. This means that the two isotopes differ in both the spatial and the temporal distribution of lung dose. There are spatial differences because fewer parti- cles of 238PuO2 are required to produce a given average dose to the lung than of 239puO2. ThuS 239puO2 probably delivers a more uniform dose to the lung. There are temporal differences in dose because 238PuO2 clears the lung more rapidly, and thus delivers its dose more quickly than does 239PuO2. For all three analytic approaches described above, the data were found to be well fitted by a pure quadratic model with different coefficients for</page><page sequence="34">ABSTRACTS 369 239PuO2 and 238PUO2. Linear models were strongly rejected, and a linear- quadratic function did not improve the fit over a pure quadratic one. The risk resulting from a given cumulative dose from 239puO2 was found to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than that from the same dose from 238PUO2. In analyses including all tumors regardless of the context of obser- vation, the extrapolated lifetime risk at 0.01 Gy was estimated to be 66 per 106 for 239puO2 and 10 per 106 for 238PuO2. These results could be inter- preted as indicating that cumulative dose to the lung, by itself, is not an adequate predictor of lung cancer risks, and that spatial and temporal distributions of dose are necessary factors to consider in determining risks. It is important to note that radiation dose estimates used for these analy- ses were preliminary, and are currently being refined. Dose estimation in these studies is complex, and there are various alternative methods that are being considered. We plan to evaluate different dose estimation strategies by comparing how well doses calculated by different methods predict lung cancer risks. We also plan to use this approach to evaluate which measures of exposure (cumulative dose, dose rate, dose received early in life, etc.) are the best predictors of risk. Results of analyses of rodents exposed to inhaled radon and radon prog- eny (6). Results of analyses in which tumors were assumed to be incidental are described first. In general, for animals with comparable cumulative exposures, higher risks were found in animals exposed at the lower expo- sure rates than at the higher rates. The estimated linear coefficients for rodents exposed at 5, 50, and 500 WLM per week were 462, 404, and 189 per 106 WLM, respectively; the differences in these coefficients were statis- tically significant with P &lt; 0.001. However, the risks for the three groups with cumulative exposures of 320 WLM were 459, 229, and 401 per 106 WLM for animals exposed at 5, 50 and 500 WLM per week, respectively; these coefficients did not differ significantly. Separate power functions were fitted to the 50 and 500 WLM per week groups. These provided a significantly better fit than the linear functions with estimated powers of 0.8 for the 500 WLM per week animals and 1.4 for the 50 WLM per week animals. The reasons for the exposure rate differences are not fully under- stood, and the implications of these findings for risks resulting from very low-level exposure are unclear. The linear coefficients reported above can be interpreted as lifetime risks associated with continuous lifetime exposure to radon and radon progeny. They are reasonably comparable to the estimate of 350 per 106 WLM provided by the BEIR IV committee (8), but are somewhat higher than the BEIR IV estimate of 140 per 106 WLM for nonsmoking males. Analyses based on the assumption that tumors were fatal were also con- ducted. These led to similar conclusions although the risk coefficients were somewhat lower, and the evidence for a difference in exposure rates was not quite as strong. Acknowledgment.

Over the last 25 years, the JANUS program in the Biological and Medi- cal Research Division at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has com- piled a data base on the response of both sexes of an F, hybrid mouse, the B6CF, (C57BL/6 x BALB/c), to external whole-body irradiation by ?Co ' rays and fission neutrons. Three basic patterns of exposure for both neu- trons and ' rays have been investigated: single exposures, 24 equal once- weekly exposures, and 60 equal once-weekly exposures. All irradiations were terminated at predetermined total doses, with dose given in centi- grays to the midline of the mouse. Life shortening has been used as an analysis end point because it summa- rizes the cumulative effect of all injuries experienced by an organism. Dose-response models were applied to the ANL data for life shortening (1) to (i) describe the response function for neutron exposures, (ii) evaluate the effect of dose range and pattern of exposure on the response function for neutrons, and (iii) provide a set of neutron relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for the ANL data base. Dose-response models were generated by weighted regression using functions of dose as predictor variables and the inverse variance as a weighting device. Nonlinear models were estimated by iteratively re- weighted least squares. Indicator variables were used to test whether model parameters (e.g., slope or power) differed by sex or pattern of exposure. When the dose range for neutron exposure was restricted to ever smaller maximum doses, the linear response functions became progressively steeper. This implied curvature in the response at low doses (&lt;60 cGy) could not be detected using a linear-quadratic model. In an effort to de- scribe a different form of curvature, a power function was fitted to the low-dose range. However, an estimated power of unity again suggested that a simple linear model adequately described the dose response for exposure to neutrons in the low-dose range. A polynomial spline model with an unknown join point was used to model the entire dose range for neutrons. The spline model joined an initial linear equation to a terminal linear-quadratic equation. A negative estimate for the join point (dose value) suggested that the entire dose range could be described adequately by a linear-quadratic model. The fit of a power function model was comparable to that of a linear-quadratic equa- tion. An enhancement of injury by neutrons with dose protraction was ob- served in both sexes and began at doses as low as 60 cGy. The response for animals exposed to 7 rays was linear and inversely dependent on the pro- traction period. The neutron component (numerator) of RBE values was based on slopes from the progressively truncated data prior to the emer- gence of an exposure pattern effect. RBE values, ranging from 6 to 43, were influenced by the neutron dose range selected for analysis. However, the decreasing effectiveness of y rays with dose protraction was the primary</page><page sequence="35">370 ABSTRACTS factor responsible for the magnitude of an RBE value. A nearly identical range of RBE values resulted from an approach based on power functions. Histopathologic analysis of the animals used in the study of life shorten- ing indicated that 85% of the deaths were caused by neoplasms. Primary tumors were categorized as either tumors of connective tissue origin or tumors of epithelial tissue origin. Cumulative mortality within age inter- vals (days after initial exposure) for each category of neoplasm was re- gressed on linear or linear-quadratic functions of dose constrained through a control intercept. Data for the two sexes, both radiation qualities, and all exposure patterns were fitted separately. The response to neutrons was generally linear-quadratic and the re- sponse to 7 rays was nearly always linear. An enhancement of mortality with protraction of the neutron dose was observed for epithelial tumors. The reduced effectiveness of protracted y irradiation observed in the life- shortening analyses was present for both neoplastic end points. Risk coeffi- cients for neutron exposure were larger for females than for males and greater for epithelial tumors than for connective tissue tumors. RBE values were calculated as the ratio of linear slope coefficients even if derived from a linear-quadratic equation. No judgment was made con- cerning which 7-ray exposure should be selected as a reference radiation; instead, RBE values were calculated within patterns of exposure. The larg- est RBE values (7-25) were estimated for epithelial tumors with lower values (3-13) observed for connective tissue tumors. The protraction effect for -y-ray exposure (decreasing effectiveness) greatly influenced the magni- tude of an RBE value. However, approximately 25% of the increase could be attributed to an enhancement of neutron-induced mortality associated with dose protraction. Connective tumors are the dominant tumor in the B6CF, mouse, with tumors of lymphoreticular origin accounting for approximately 80% of this class. Piece-wise exponential models were fitted to the hazard function for this end point. Models were fitted separately for each radiation quality, exposure pattern, and sex. The risk of death (relative to controls) for all dose groups declined rap- idly during midlife (approximately 800 days) but remained significantly elevated throughout the entire dying out process. Relative risks were larger for females than for males and were significantly dose dependent for both sexes. An enhancement of mortality with protraction of the neutron dose for lymphoreticular tumors was detected. Exposure accumulated over 60 weeks was approximately twice as effective as single exposures in males throughout the duration of the experiment. In females, the protraction effect was a factor of 7 by 700 days after first exposure but disappeared by 900 days. RBE estimates for lymphoreticular tumors were dose and time dependent. However, when RBE values were estimated for a specific age, they were consistent with those calculated within age intervals using linear and linear-quadratic models. REFERENCE 1. B. A. CARNES, D.

The European Childhood Leukemia/Lymphoma Incidence Study. D. MAXWELL PARKIN, International Agency for Research on Cancer, France (on behalf of the ECLIS Study Group). Following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986, radioactive materials were deposited over large areas of Europe. There were three successive "plumes" of material affecting (i) the Eastern USSR, Poland, and Sweden, (ii) Central Europe-especially Austria, Ba- varia, North Italy, and part of Switzerland, and finally (iii) Romania and Bulgaria. Most exposure was to 131, 134Cs, and '37Cs and was generally of rather low magnitude. Exposure to humans was both external (mainly from ground deposition) and internal (from ingestion of contaminated food). Estimated average exposures require rather complex models and differ according to the methods used. UNSCEAR (1) has produced esti- mates for all national populations in Europe (and by subregion within some countries). Nationally, the highest average exposures outside the USSR were in Bulgaria (760 ,Sv) and the lowest in Portugal (2 /1Sv). These figures can be compared with the average (worldwide) exposure from natu- ral sources of 2400 4Sv per person-although there is considerable geo- graphic variation. Outside the immediate vicinity of the accident, the predicted health effects due to radiation are rather small. Nevertheless, these health effects should be monitored for several reasons. First, it is a matter of great public concern, and already there are reports of clusters of leukemia (2), excess infant mortality (3), and excess premature births among malformed chil- dren (4) in subnational areas with higher-than-average exposures. Investi- gation of apparent clusters is greatly facilitated by a large-scale systematic study. Second, it is possible that either the dose estimates or the models used in predicting cancer risk are in error, and the excess will be higher than expected. Childhood leukemia is the most logical choice of adverse health effect for monitoring (5). Radiation-induced leukemias appear early (2-10 years) after exposure and provide the largest excess incidence of any cancer. Background incidence of leukemia is relatively constant in Europe (6). Finally, a fairly comprehensive monitoring scheme is already in place in the form of registers of cancer and childhood cancer, so that a study of geographical and temporal trends in incidence requires no special data collection systems in most countries. It should be noted that the relatively good prognosis of childhood leukemia in many countries and likely im- provements in therapy and survival in others mean that mortality data are virtually useless for monitoring risk. The European Childhood Leukemia/Lymphoma Incidence Study (ECLIS) was set up in 1987. It involves cancer registries in 17 European countries (Table IV). Some 60 million children live in the areas covered, and approximately 2400 cases of leukemia are expected every year. BEIR V (7) provides a formula for calculating relative risk. Assuming (a) a latent period of 2 years, and (b) that risk at 2-4 years is the same as that at 5-10 (to which the BEIR data apply), the approximation RR = 1 + (0.243d) x exp(4.885) can be obtained, where d = dose in Sv. For an average expo- sure of 500 tSv, the relative risk is thus 1.016. Table IV shows the esti- mated excess cases in each country using this formula. The average is an 0.8% increase, with a maximum in Byelorussia (around 6%). The study involves the collection of data on all recorded cases of child- hood leukemia and lymphoma occurring in the populations covered by the registries. Collation of data from the different centers and its analysis is coordinated by IARC. Registries send an updated file of every case regis- tered, with details of age, date of birth, date of diagnosis, place of residence, and histological diagnosis, at annual intervals. Data collection to the end of 1987 is now almost complete. The period 1980-1985 will serve as a baseline to investigate differences in the incidence between regions and to provide information on underly- ing trends in incidence in the 6 years preceding the accident. Changes in 1986 and subsequent years will be studied to see if they bear any relation- ship to the estimated exposure levels in different regions. Since the place of residence of all cancer cases is recorded, it is possible to study almost any geographic unit. The basis analyses, however, will comprise either national populations or broad subregions within certain countries, for which expo- sure estimates have been prepared by UNSCEAR. Preliminary results confirm the rather constant background incidence of leukemia, around 40 per million children per year (Table IV). There is a slight male preponderance in almost all countries. Time trends in 1980- 1985 are rather variable in different countries, but several show small in- creases in incidence, against which future changes (post accident) will have to be evaluated.</page><page sequence="36">ABSTRACTS 371 TABLE IV ECLIS Study (Children 0-14): Average First Year Effective Dose Equivalent of Radiation, Observed Incidence of Leukemia in 1980-1985 and Estimated Cases of Leukemia Postaccident Annual cases 2 years postaccident Annual incidence rate Dose Pop 1980-1985 Expected Estimated excess (ASv) (millions) (per million) (baseline rate) (radiogenic) Austria 670 1.3 45 59 1.3 Czechoslovakia 350 3.8 40 152 1.7 Denmark 30 1.0 47 47 0.0 Finland 460 0.9 47 42 0.6 France (part) 155 1.6 (37) 59 0.3 German Democratic Republic 210 3.1 37 115 0.8 Federal Republic of Germany 130 9.6 42 403 1.7 Hungary 230 2.4 36 86 0.6 Italy (part) 370 1.3 (47) 61 0.7 Netherlands 58 2.5 41 103 0.2 Norway 230 0.8 43 34 0.3 Poland 270 9.4 29 273 2.4 Sweden 150 1.5 41 62 0.3 Switzerland (part) 270 0.5 (40) 20 0.2 UK England and Wales 27 11.1 39 433 0.4 Scotland 27 1.3 38 49 0.0 USSR Byelorussia 1950 2.5 [37] 93 5.8 RFSFR (3)a 440 1.6 [37] 59 0.8 RFSFR (4)b 135 2.3 [37] 85 0.4 Estonia 135 0.2 37 7 0.0 Lithuania 135 0.8 37 30 0.1 Yugoslavia (Slovenia) 625 0.5 42 21 0.4 Total 60 2293 19.0 Note.

The intensity and peculiarities of radiocontamination of surrounding areas as a result of the Chernobyl accident, as well as the absence of compa- rable events, require new approaches to the estimation of the levels of population irradiation and the calculation of the dose that will be accrued. The average total dose equivalent for the areas under strict control</page><page sequence="37">372 ABSTRACTS amounted to 0.2-16 cSv for the 1986-1990 period in each of three Repub- lics. The main concern during these years has been the thyroid glands of children and teenagers who were evacuated from the 30-km zone around the nuclear power plant and of those who live in areas that have been affected by iodine radionuclides. Another population group under obser- vation is adults who were performing cleanup work in the vicinity of the accident during the so-called "iodine period" (April-June 1986) and those who live in the district with the most iodine contamination. The thyroid dose equivalent for 45% of the adults and 41% of the children did not exceed 30 cSv, for 35% of adults and 33% of the children the dose equiva- lent was in the range 30-100 cSv, and for 20% of the adults and 26% of the children the dose equivalent was over 100 cSv. Based on measurements on 150,000 people, the average thyroid dose equivalent was lower in adults than in children. In an area with a population of 135,000 in 1989, 17 people were shown to have thyroid cancer during the period covered by the study. The average annual index per 100,000 persons for that area was 1.3 and in the Ukraine the index was 2.4. To improve the reliability of the conclusion we plan to expand the study and to include other controlled areas. There is evidence of thyroid cancer in the inhabitants of areas adjacent to the 30-km zone around the nuclear power plant. Because of the high sensitivity of the blood-forming system to ionizing radiation, the condition of blood formation was examined in thousands of children. Analysis of morbidity of children in the period following the accident did not reveal excess cases of leukosis or lymphoma in the con- trolled regions of the Ukraine and Byelorussia. Public health services of the total dispensary system carry out annual medical examinations of 95-97% of the population included in the All- Union Distributed Register. On the basis of the results of these examina- tions, 61.9% of the residents of the Ukraine were evaluated as healthy in 1987, 55% in 1988, and only 48.6% in 1989. Such a decrease in health indices has occurred in both the adult and the child populations. It must be emphasized that the negative changes in health, both the currently observed state and the possible changes in the future, are caused not only by ionizing radiation but also by a great number of factors. The general ecological situation in the areas contaminated with radionuclides is now unfavorable. The indices indicate a worsening of health, especially among children, not only in the controlled areas but also in areas in which radiation was thought to have had no consequences. That is why the scien- tific investigations of the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation must be intensified and expanded. Furthermore, the studies should clarify the ef- fects and mechanisms of interaction between ionizing radiation and ecolog- ical factors such as pesticides and other biologically active substances.</page></plain_text>
