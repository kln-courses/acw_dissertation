<plain_text><page sequence="1">399 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HEAD-HUNTING IN ASSAM. [WITH PLATES XXXVIII-XLII.] By J. H. HUTTON. IN his recently published book on Borneo,' Dr. Hose has suggested two possible sources of the practice of head-hunting by the tribes of that island-the one is a desire for human hair for use as an ornament for weapons and dress; the other, and the one to which he inclines, is the desire for human beings to send as slaves to accompany the dead to the next world. Now, the latter idea certainly exists in Assam, and is to be found at present among the Kuki tribes, and formerly among the Ahoms, who buried many slaves with their princes.2 Head-hunting, however, is found among tribes who certainly have not this belief, and seems to flourish more vigorously where it is absent than where it is present. Similarly, in Borneo, Dr. Hose tells uS3 that the Iban is a more inveterate head-hunter than the Kayan, though he does not need the heads for his dead relatives; and although Dr. Hose's opinion, that the Ibans have acquired the practice from the Kayan, may be true in Borneo, I am inclined to think that the process on the mainland has been the other way round, and that the practice of taking heads to put on graves is merely the result of the influence of contact with head-hutnters on a people practising human sacrifice in their funeral ceremonies. To demonstrate this, it is necessary to show that head-hunting is part of a definite cult, and has a meanimg and purpose of its own entirely independent of mere blood- thirstiness or of any idea of providing post-mortem servitors for the dead. I propose, therefore, in this paper, to sketch what seems to be the theory underlying head- hunting in Assam. It is probable that any head-hunting cult existing there is intimately connected with similar cults in south-eastern Asia and Indonesia, and it is possible that the connection may really extend a great deal further afield than that. Now, the religion of the Naga Hills is centred very largely upon fertility-cults. The agricultural year is marked by ceremonies intended to promote the growth of the crops, and the feasts of merit by which individuals acquire social status are likewise marked by ceremonies to promote fertility and magical rites, for infecting the village as a whole with the fertility of the individual whose crops and cattle and affairs have so prospered that he is able to afford the feast. The fertility of 1 Natural Man, p. 145. 2 Gait, History of Assam, p. 121. 3 Natural Man, pp. 33, 144.</page><page sequence="2">400 J. H. HUTTON.-The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam. the family or of the village is pronmoted by the erection of phallic symbols, and the village is infected with the fertility of the erector of them by the simple process of dragging them all round the village. I need not go into details to demonstrate this, as I have already dealt with this aspect of the Naga Hills fertility-cults in previous papers in the Journal.' It will be enough here to say that the erection of menhirs in the Naga Hills is closely bound up with a magical fertility-cult, and the menhir itself is by origin a phallus (P1. XXXVIII, fig. 1). It is also associated with water though this aspect of the cult has decayed; but both inenhirs and stone sitting-places, the erection of which sometimes takes the place of that of menhirs, are to be found in association with artificial tanks or ponds, as in the case of a famous menhir at Khonoma, of the baze at Pulomi (" Kenoma "), and the dahus in the village and the great group of menhirs at Gwilong (" Togwema") in the Manipur State.2 The Manipuris, too, erect phallic poles in their tanks, and the Assamese " marry " a new tank with or to an erect pole to make it hold plenty of water; while at UTngma, in the Ao country, stones are placed in a roadside puddle which increases the quantity of water in the pool, and so the quantity of rice in the crop, apparently because it causes more or less rain according to the depth of the water around the stones. In some cases, as at Khonoma, menhirs are actually erected in the rice fields themselves, c.ultivation there being permanent and irrigated, not shifting. Now, if the magical phallus be a method of ensuring fertility, it is not apparently in itself the source of fertility, for this seems to lie in the souls of the dead. This is not explicitly stated in so many words by any Naga tribe to my knowledge, and it would appear to be contradicted by the eschatological beliefs ordinarily recounted to a questioner on these matters, but it is very clearly indicated by practices connected with the dead in various tribes. Thllus, among the Angami of the Khonoma group of villages, as among the Kachha Naga (Nzemni) of Nakama and Kenoma who adjoin Khonoma, the graves of warriors used to bear a wooden image of the dead (P1. XXXVIII, fig. 3). This image was always destroyed-thrown away into the jungle, that is-on the last day before the sowing of the millet crop, to the accompaniment of much firing of guns as at a funeral. In the Kohima group the image, which is still in use, has to be taken down and finally disposed of (it is buried alongside the real grave, or, in some cases, burnt) in the month that follows that in which the Terhengi (Harvest Home) festival is celebrated, failing which it is kept a whole twelve months longer till that time in the next year, but " it is not good to let it stand too long." When represented in the most simplified form possible, the human figure and the phallus become virtually 1 "Carved Monoliths at Dimapur and an Angami Naga Ceremony."

HUTTON.-The Significance of Head-Hunti,ng in Assamn. 401 identical, which may have caused some confusion, but that this wooden figure contains, or was formerly believed to contain, the soul of the dead is sufficiently indicated by the practice of a trans-frontier section of the Konyak tribe, who, like the Angami, make much use of megalithic stonework, in making wooden figures for all their dead and assembling them in family groups under small thatched shelters outside their villages (P1. XXXIX, figs. 1 and 2). These figures are provided with horn-like projections on the top of their heads,' between which the skull is placed in order that the soul may leave it and enter the wooden figure, after which the skull is removed, and food, etc., provided for the soul where the figure is. Others of the Konyak tribes use basket figures, and some use stones, into both of which the skull is actually inserted, in the one case temporarily, in the other permanently (P1. XL, figs. 1 and 2). Col. Gurdon states that the Khasis of Shella also put the bones of their cremated dead into posts.2 Some Angamis have, moreover, a tradition that, if a man die, the spirit of the crops produces more grain, but it was " tabu to talk about such things as crops being better if men died, since it was bad for men to die."3 The association of the souls of the dead with the fertility of the crops is doubtless to be seen in the Rengma custom of digging a pool in front of the soul statue. If it fills, the descendants of the dead man become rich. It is again to be seen in the Ao custom, observed still only in one or two villages, by which the smoke-dried body of a dead relative is preserved in the house until after the eating of the first- fruits of the harvest following, and then only laid out on its platform outside the village near the village path.4 But it is seen most clearly in the custom of the Kalyo-Kengyu of Laruri (" Karami ") village, where the corpses are all preserved in the houses until the first day of the ceremony which inaugurates the sowing of the crop,5 when all the village dead are brought forth together, the corpses broken up, and the bones carefully counted and placed in the granary, while the boat-shaped coffin and the shreds of flesh and the funeral mats that have covered them are all put away (the process is described as " thrown away ") in a rough shelter in the uncultivated jungle below the outskirts of the village. The inference clearly is that the souls remain in the smoke-dried bodies till they are pulled to pieces,6 and 1 See Man, April, 1927. Plate D, Fig. 4. 2 The Khasis, p. 137. 3 This statement was made to me by Lhurikhole, son of one of the head men of Muzuma, an intelligent and reliable informant. 4 Mills, The Ao Nagas, p. 279. 5 The Kukis, according to Macrae (Asiatic Researches, vii, p. 194), used to burn the year's collection of corpses, till then exposed on platforms, at " the spring festival." It has been stated that the ancient E,yptians embalmed their dead because they believed that the soul would not migrate while the body remained entire. The Laruri custom suggests the existence of a similar belief in that village, particularly as the soul has a miniature dwelling erected for it outside the village for its use during the time that elapses between the death and the final breaking up and disposing of the body.

That this is the underlying principle of the association of the dead with the crops is very strongly supported by the Karen theory of the soul recorded by Marshall,1 who reports that the Karens state quite explicitly that the k'la (souls) of human beings becoxne a sort of pupa (sqheu) which resembles an egg or bladder filled with a vaporous substance. When this pupa bursts, its contents spread over and fertilize the fields, and their fructifying substance passes again into bodies through the grain eaten, and so again to the seminal fluid enabling men and animals also to propagate life. So much for the connection between the soul and the crop, bringing back the mind irresistibly to someone's ingenious suggestion that the theory of the trans- migration of the soul arose from the sight of the fresh corn springing from the grave of one whose burial portion had included grain. The second point in my argum-ent is that the soul resides in the head, or, at any rate, more especially in the head than in other parts of the body. This is explicitly stated by some of the Ao Naga tribe, who regard the vibration of the mem- brane over an infant's fontanel as caused by the movement of the soul,2 conceived of, I think, as shaped like a very diminutive replica of the body, inside the head. It is perhaps to be inferred from the Chang Naga statement that yawning is caused by the soul's dancing about inside the mouth no doubt, in its impatience to leave the body during sleep. And I think that it must certainly be inferred from the beliefs that exist in this area as to the sanctity of the head. This sanctity is explicitly stated by Pinto of some people of Burma, I think the Peguans,3 and it is to be inferred from such customs as that of the Thado, who usually tabu the use of a man's pot of hair-grease to any relative other than his wife, and that of separate burial for the head, practised by the Konyak group of Nagas, by the Chang and Phom Nagas and by the Siyin Chins and occasionally by other Kuki tribes, the body being left to rot while the head is buried in a pot or a stone cist or secreted in a niche in a cliff (P1. XL, figs. 2 and 3). The location of the soul in the head is also suggested by the Angami habit of putting a drop of liquor on the forehead for the ropvii of the drinker before actually drinking; by the belief of the same tribe that a leopard or tiger-skin, when used to cover a shield, should always be put on head downwards, because, if the head of the animal be raised above that of the 1 The Karen, People of Burma, p. 222. 2 Mills, The Ao Nagas, p. 225. 3 In the case of the Peguans, I think the chin is specified byPinto as the sacrosanct spot, and it is perhaps significant that in some Konyak villages the jaw is the most important part of the skull and receives distinctive treatment. The same idea seems present perhaps in the Khasia Hills (vide Gurdon, The Khasis. pp. 132-4).</page><page sequence="5">J. H. HUTTON.-The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam. 403 shield-bearer, the former will cause the latter to stumble and fall; by the practice of the Angami again in sticking a scrap of wormwood leaf in the centre of the fore- head, to avert the influence of evil spirits or of the " mana" of strangers (a practice which perhaps indicates the origin of the Hindu caste-mark); and by the Ahom practice of sitting before a superior, as in Java, so as to avoid raising the head above the superior's head. The fact that the Konyaks of certain villages transfer the soul to a wooden figure by putting the skull of the dead man on the top of the figure has already been mentioned. The idea that the soul is located in the head has perhaps arisen from the sight of the diminutive reflections in the pupil of the human eye,' but, however that may be, the idea that the soul resides in the head is well established in Assam and Burma, and the Naga Hills are no exception. The soul, then, is a fertilizer, and it resides in the head. Obviously, therefore, if fertilizing soul-matter is required, the way to get it is by cutting off and taking home a head. And that this is the underlying purpose in head-hunting there are many indications. The connection between the taking of heads and the well- being of the community that takes them has been pointed out before. There is the well-known instance of the Angamis of Kigwema, who took a couple of heads because there was small-pox about.2 This, I suggest, was not at all by way of sacrifice to the spirit of small-pox, but to add to the soul-matter of the clan, and so increase its powers of resistance to the disease. It would not be until the idea of soul-matter was lost that the idea of a sacrifice would come in to replace it. Again, I strongly suspect that the true reason of the general objection on the part of Naga girls to marriage with a man who had not taken a head is, or was, based on an idea that until he had brought back a little surplus soul-matter from outside a man was less likely to be fertile and beget stout sons than a successful warrior would be. As for the direct association of the head and the crop, the case of the Wa of Burma may be cited.3 With them head-hunting is directly connected with the springing of the crop and appears to be a purely seasonal duty, the opening and closing dates for this sport being fixed and known to everybody and heads out of season for the rest of the year. Heads taken by Nagas are treated in various ways, but the idea of the acquisition of the soul is generally present, and is discernible in the procedure adopted.4 In nearly all cases steps are taken to induce the captured soul to call its relatives to I In Hawaii a human eye was put in the oil which was used to anoint a king. (Ratzel, History of allnkind, i, p. 298.) 2 See The Angami Nagas, p. 160. 3 Scott and Hardiman, Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States, I, i, pp. 430 and 496-500. 4 In the Garo Hills the soul of a man who is killed by an elephant or a tiger is reincarnated in the body of such an animal (A. Playfair, The Garos, p. 105), and the idea suggested is that that sort of animal has acquired the soul-matter. The Garos also at one timne made grave-figures with projections apparently intended to hold on the skull like the Konyak Nagas referred to,. and there is such a figure in the Indian Museum at Calcutta. 2 D 2</page><page sequence="6">404 J. H. HUTTON.-The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam. come and have their heads taken too, a danger which is countered in some cases by displaying something to attract the souls back to their own village. Thus, when Chentang had taken a couple of heads from Sangpurr in 1923, the relatives of the dead hung out the baskets of the latter outside the village on the slope towards Chentang, and put stones in them from Sangpurr land to catch the attention of the souIs in Chentang and remind them of their native soil and so lure them back. The Yimtsungr, as also sometimes the Sema, feed the soul within the head with choice tit-bits of fat skewered to the mouth and eyes, that it may call the souls of its relatives and decoy them with the prospects of a like feast. The Lhota hangs his enemy heads on the village head-tree, a ficus, below which rest the oha stones-round stones which are the repository of the " luck " or the " mana " of the village, and which are carried with the inhabitants on all migrations1 (P1. XLI, fig. 1). This use of a ficus for the heads is another instance of fertility-magic. A ficus is always used by Lhotas for enemy heads as it often is by Konyaks and Phoms for the corpses of the dead. Some Konyaks use the euphorbia, a cactus-like tree or plant, which is also reverenced by Kacharis,2 who also associate funeral ceremonies with the harvest following the death.3 Theficus and the euphorbia have this in common, that both exude a milk-like fluid when broken. That this is the reason of their association with fertility is suggested by the fact that the ficus was used to give fertility to barren women in Africa and Italy, and was worshipped for that reason by the Akamba,4 while the Akikuyu regarded it as the haunt of souls of the dead,5 and it was wor- shipped to obtain offspring in the south of India.6 The tree used for a head-tree by the Ao, as by some Kachha Naga, is the " madar "-an erythrina, a tree of peculiar vitality, any branch of which will take root and grow if stuck into the ground. The head taken by an Angami is ultimately buried face downwards, but it is first placed upon the Kipuchie, the sacred stone of the village, into which, no doubt, the soul enters. The Tangkhul puts his head on a pile of stones in the village,7 and the Konyak hoists his on a bamboo which is tied to an erect menhir (P1. XLI, fig. 3), or else exposes it on a stone table, in either case putting up a small erect stone for each head taken, and transferring the skull ultimately to the house of the chief or to the bachelors' hall, each skull beinag, in some villages, decorated with a pair of buffalo horns, probably as a fertility sy-mbol (P1. XLII, figs. I and 2). This view of the significance of head-hunting seems to me confirmed by occa- sional cases in which men have taken the heads of their own side and carried them home rather than let them fall into the hands of the enemy. I can only give one 1 See Mills, The Lhota NSagas. 2 Endle, The Kacharis, pp. 30, 36. 3 Soppitt, Kachari Tribes in the North Cachar Hills, p. 40. 4 Frazer, The Golden Bough, ii, pp. 313, 316. 317; viii, p. 113. 5 [bid., ii, p. 316. 6 Frazer, Folk-Lore in the Old Testament, iii, p. 316. 7 Hodson, Naga Tribes of 7Janipur, p. 117.</page><page sequence="7">J.

One or two other considerations arise in this connection. Clearly head-hunting, if based on the acquisition of soul-matter for the fertilizing of the crop, might develop into human sacrifice, and the idea of the sacrificed life being an offering to a god would grow up as the original motive became obscured and forgotten. It is not, therefore,. surprising to find among Naga tribes survivals of what appears to have been human sacrifice, as among the Kachha Nagas and the Lhotas, who spear a rude wooden figure at certain occasional festivals, or among the Angamis, who kill a calf and sometimes a puppy dog at the Terhengi genna (Harvest Home) after investing them with certain attributes of huiman beings.2 And among one of the Konyak tribes on the Burma side of the Patkoi range human sacrifice actually does survive in a limited area, while among the Rangpang Konyaks on the Assam side it did survive until our frontier officers came into regular contact with them some years ago. So, too, this theory of head-hunting suggests the principle on which some cannibalism, at any rate, has been explained-the eating of an enemy to acquire his attributes. The greater the warrior in the Naga Hills, the more highly prized is his head; and it is perhaps signiiicant that, although no cannibalism is known among the Naga tribes, all tribes have the tradition of a cannibal village " just a little further east, beyond the next range of hills." Cannibalism has actually been reported of the hill tribes of Assam, though only on the very doubtful authority of a Dutch sailor shipwrecked in the Sunderbans and taken to Assam as a foreign artillery-man in the expedition of Mir Jumla in the seventeenth century.3 Some significance, however, may perhaps be attached to the popularity of an ornament called " enemy's teeth," in which the teeth seem to be represented by rows of cowries; and an early missionary in Assam reported that some of the Nagas (a Konyak tribe) actually wore necklaces of real teeth taken from their enemies.4 But, if this was so, the habit has apparently died out. It is also a fact that part of the head of a British official killed at Khonoma in 1880 was tasted by the young warriors of the village. The reason given is that the white flesh looked so good, buit one may suspect that the idea of absorbing white attributes was not entirely absent. The practice of sacrificing captives on graves to minister to the dead in another world has been mentioned already. It was practised by the Kayans in Borneo and by the Kukis and Ahoms in Assam. In the case of both the Kukis and the Kayans the practice is to some extent confused with head-hunting, as also in the case of the HIose, Natural Man, p. 145. 2 See Journ. Roy. Anthrop. Inst., lii, p. 69. 3 Relation du Naufrage d',un Vaisseau Hollandais, nomnme Ter Schelling, vers la Cote de Bengala (Amsterdam, 1681), p. 73. 4 Owen, Naga Tribes in Communication with Assam (1844), p. 15.</page><page sequence="8">406 J.

Kagoro of Nigeria,' and it seems to me extremely likely, in the case of the Kuki at any rate, that the confusion has arisen as a result of the contact between a people who considered it necessary to send their dead to Paradise fully accompanied by slaves and chattels, and a people with other eschatological beliefs, but who prac- tised head-hunting in order to obtain soul-matter. A head-hunter, imbued with the idea that the head contained the soul, but wishful or compelled to provide a soul for a dead chief, would find it much easier to bring in the head instead of the whole body; the same combination of ideas would naturally give rise to the Ao theory of fertility of the crops as the gift of dead ancestors, and the interaction of ideas between the head-hunting Naga and the slave-hunting Kuki has obviously much to answer for in the Naga Hills, where the Ao Naga again holds that the souls of the heads he takes serve him in the next world, while the Thado Kuki used to hunt for the heads of men and animals to hang them up on his father's grave. The Kachin, probably less influenced by Naga beliefs than the Kuki who preceded him down the Chindwin valley, does take heads, but merely seems to produce them, in order to prove the truth of his claim to have killed an enemy, and then to throw them away. It appears to me that the truth is, that the practice of head-hunting, the erection of megalitlis, and the theory of the importance of soul-matter as a fertilizer belong to the Naga culture in contradistinction to the Kuki culture, and are to be associated with the buffalo-keeping tribes who inhabited the hills before the gayal or mithun-keeping Kukis, who seem to have no definite megalithic culture of their own, began to filter into their fastnesses through the defiles from the Chindwin valley. The mithun is unquestionably of miore recent introduction than the buffalo, and the Angamis have traditions of the time when only buffalo were kept and the mithun was unknown. On general grounds, I am inclined to associate the buffalo with an Austro-Asiatic or Indonesian culture, and the mithun with a Tibeto-Burman culture,2 and to assign the head-hunting and soul-fertilizer beliefs to the same Austro-Asiatic or Indonesian culture, distinguishing them entirely, in provenance, from the practice of sending slaves to Paradise with dead chiefs. It remains to consider for a moment the question of head-hunting elsewhere. I do not propose to plunge into the Diffusionist controversy, but head-hunting is a widespread practice, and the question obviously arises as to how far head-hunting in other areas may be based on the same underlying theory as it is in Assam. In Indonesia, at any rate, I think I may fairly assume that if the view put forward holds good for Assam, it is almost certainly good for the whole Indonesian area. The Cham of Annam bury close to their rice-fields.3 Beliefs as to the soul in the Celebes differ little, or not at all, from those in Assam, and to read an account of a hill tribe in Borneo or the Philippines gives a Naga Hills reader a vivid impression of 1 Tremearne, Tailed Head-Hunters of Nigeria, p. 178. 2 See my note on p. 78 of Mills' The Ao Nagas. 3 Baudesson, Indo-China and its Primitive People, p. 314.</page><page sequence="9">J. H. HUTTON.-The Stgnificance of Head-Hunting in Assamn. 407 reading of some Naga tribe with whose general culture he is perfectly familiar, but whose actual acquaintance he has never made, and, in the case of the soul- figures of the Igorot of Luzon, the technique appears from photographs to resemble closely that of the Angami Nagas, at any rate in the representation of the human head. Further afield, however, there seems to be a pretty clear cultural connection between the Naga Hills and Melanesia, and it may be pointed out that throughout the Pacific to New Zealand head-hunting seems to occur' in conjunction, at any rate sporadically, with certain beliefs in stones, more or less phallic in nature; with the custom of erecting menhirs and dolmens; with the custom of erecting soul-figures for the departed; with the idea of the sanctity of the head; and with the custom of separate disposal of the head in burial.2 In some cases (e.g. in New Guinea and in the Society Islands)3 we actually find that the head of the deceased is inserted into a chamber in the soul-figure or affixed to the top of it, affording a very close parallel to the Konyak practice already described, while in New Britain heads were worn as masks in order that the soul of the dead owner might enter the wearer.4 Even as far off as New Zealand we find head-hunting associated with the use of " posts of vitality," and with cases of the decapitation of one's own dead to prevent their heads from falling into the hands of the enemy.5 It is moreover at least suggestive that the Ao Naga should use the word tiya6 for the heavenly counterpart of his earthly body, while tii is the Polynesian word for the wooden or stone figure erected for the soul to dwell in. The probability of this being a mere coincidence is lessened by the fact that the Angami and Sema words (penna, pini) for the segregative tabu placed on a community appear to be linked up through the Malayan buni to the Polynesian words puni and tapbuni, with more or less the same sense throughout.7 In Australia again the ghost of the slain is believed to enter the slayer.8 Even as far off as South America there seem to be traces of the same association of head-hunting with a transfer of the soul-matter, with which are associated what may conceivably prove to be cultural links with Indonesian head-hunters. At any rate the head, or the hair of it, is con- sidered by the Jivaros to be the seat of the soul.9 Going in the opposite direction-north-west-it is not so easy to cite parallel cases. A connection between the dead and the harvest appears, as we might 1 E.g. see Turner, Nineteen Years in Polynesia, p. 301. 2 See " Assam and the Pacific," in Man in Indica, iv, No. 1, for a number of parallel instances. 3 Frazer, Belief in Immortality, i, pp. 311, 321; ii, pp. 323-5. 4 Ratzel, History of Mankind, i, p. 298. 5 CA Pakeha Maori," Old New Zealand, ch. iii.

H. HUTTON.-The Siqnificance of Head-Hunting in Assam. expect, in the Munda tribe,1 but we must go as far as Kafiristan to find head-hunters. There, however, we do find them using what seem to be soul-figures executed with a technique which as regards the head again seems to resemble that of the Angami and the Igor6t. We also find them cutting off the heads of their own dead to save them from the enemy, and showering grains of wheat on returning head-hunters,2 suggesting again an association of a captured soul with the fertility of the crop. Herodotus3 and, I think, Strabo, speak of head-hunters somewhere to the east of Asia Minor, where phallic worship was, of course, well known; and there is in the British Museum a bas-relief from Nineveh depicting a battle between Assurbanipal and Teumman, king of Elam, c. 668-626 B.C., in which the Assyrians are depicted as cutting off and carrying away the heads of their enemies. For authentic soul- figures in the west one must, perhaps,' go to Egypt, and bona-fide head-hunting is found in Nigeria, where it is also sometimes regarded as a qualification for marriag e.4 In Europe head-hunting still survives in the Balkans, and while menhirs and dolmens and various traces of phallic worship are found across Europe as far as the west coast of Ireland, traces of head-hunting seem also to have survived in the British Isles till a comparatively late date.5 Once the Fitzgeralds, I think, collected the heads of the slain on a Leinster battlefield, and Strabo accuses us of one form of cannibalism, while a Martinmas pig is still killed in Ireland and blood sprinkled in the fields to eiisure a good harvest by " spilling of blood,"6 and the Moss troopers of the Scottish marches used to bring back heads at their saddle-bows and stick them up in the halls of their castles while they celebrated in feast the success of their raid.7 It is stated.also that murderers in Prussia and South Italy eat part of their victim to conciliate the ghost or its relatives.8 We can only speculate as to whether or not carved and anthropomorphic menhirs were intended as soul-figures, but certainly the erection of menhirs, and probably the practice of head-hunting,9 date from neolithic times, while phallic worship and the separate disposal of the head may even take us back to a palheolithic stage of human development.'0 In which case the head-hunters' theory of the cycle of life has at least the support of a hoary antiquity.
