<plain_text><page sequence="1">London Contemporary sculpture The recent array of contemporary sculp- ture exhibitions in London revealed, as so often, the radical changes in the definition of what sculpture was, is or could be. One early defining moment was recalled at Gimpel Fils in an exhibition of works from 1957 to 1967 by Robert Adams (closed 25th October). This was the decade when Adams (1917-84) gave up carving and casting in bronze in favour of welding steel. Adams's work of this period shows an awareness of Caro, but moderated by a sense of the organic (Adams emotionally never divorces himself entirely from Henry Moore's humanism) and of fine artiness - his steel is, tellingly, bronzed. Though it was ostensibly abstract, the work remained, not untypical- ly for its time, anthropomorphic, always standing or leaning - as though ready to walk off. These are, however, very much objects that define themselves in space, dark against the ubiquitous gallery white wall, disclosing themselves by both silhouette and shadow. One piece, Screen form of 1961 (Fig.64), actually makes explicit these trans- parent figure-ground relationships by including a backdrop of geometric 'atoms'. Adams's sculptures are thoroughly com- petent, agreeably proportioned and well made, but they seem remarkably conserva- tive and sober beside the early sculptures of Nigel Hall shown at the Economist Building (closed 26th October). These large works from 1966 and 1968 in stainless steel and fibreglass mainly hang from the ceiling: in one a long lipstick-shaped projec- tile hangs down, and from its bottom-most tip a stainless steel rod goes up on the diag- onal to a hanging white collar. Space is inhabited and contained in a decidedly odd way. In the earliest work shown, Magnet (1966; Fig.65), two clouds float beside an arch, on each side of which sit two rumpled 'rugs', one a yellow green, the other a dull green. Some of these early works were 64. Screen form, by Robert Adams. 1961. Bronze, 46.5 cm. high (Exh. Gimpel Fils, London). 889</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 65. Magnet, by Nigel Hall. 1966. Polyester resin, 270.5 by 409 by 198 cm. (Artist's collection; exh. Economist Building, London). apparently inspired by the Mojave desert, and their sense of isolation and strangeness confirms this. In Magnet it is clear that the artist is relocating Magritte and Surrealism through Pop; in the works of 1968 this sense of isolated forms strangely inhabiting space is achieved purely by abstract shapes. Some drawings from 1964 and 1965 were also shown: in them Giacometti-like rooms are drawn in a manner close to early Hockney: deflated human forms and a plethora of hanging light fittings wait in empty spaces. Two recent sculptures placed on the plaza outside were well proportioned but lacked a sense of surprise, occupying the curiously wind-swept space with a certain insouciant obliquity. Perhaps he has become (as Adams did) somewhat constrained by his own sense of style and good taste. Neverthe- less, given that his best-known work, his ele- gant and sparse 'drawings in space' with thin rods, were not represented here at all, one realises that Hall is a more complex artist than may have been imagined. One hopes some museum will soon give him a retrospective where the full range of his wuvre can be seen. Donald Judd's works, a group of which from the artist's estate in Marfa were dis- played at the Lisson Gallery (closed 18th October), were once (much to his displea- sure) called, by Robert Smithson, uncanny. Indeed at times, despite their seeming geo- metric rationality, they do appear so: their proportions seem logical but unnatural, uncouth even, their placement (as with Hall at his more eccentric) uncomfortable. The bright colours of the recent works accentu- ate their strangeness, and their arbitrary quiditty. The greatest delight in this exhibi- tion was the ten-part stacked piece of 1990, in aluminium and plexiglass, which when installed well, as here, is not defined by light but acts as its container, chanelling it into a wonderful vertical sweep. IfJudd remains an individual innovator, while Hall in his eclecticism seems to reveal an anxiety of influence, other British sculp- tors demonstrate yet other attitudes to their predecessors. A sculptor such as Stephen Cox (whose recent Dulwich Picture Gallery exhibition was reviewed in the September issue) seems to embrace the possibility of influence: his career takes on board mini- malism, then renaissance sculpture, the truth to materials of Gill and early Moore, and more recently Indian and classical Roman sculpture. By contrast, the recent work by the young artist Bob and Roberta Smith (Roberta and Bob are in fact alter egos of Patrick Brill) shown at the Chisen- hale Gallery (closed 27th October)' refus- es to accept the integrity and authenticity of the object and its protocols. Despite a com- mitment to making, Smith is anarchic, unconcerned with tradition in sculpture: indeed it is parodied both in one of the video portraits shown here where an elderly woman talks of a family tradition of casting vegetables and painting them as sculptures, and in such word pieces as 'WHEN DONALD JUDD COMES TO OUR PLACE HE HAS SUPER BREW. AT HIS WE GET CHEEPO TITAN'. The true matter of sculpture is Lifestyle, not objects per se, Smith seems to imply. The objects he creates have a crumminess that seems of a piece with the claim, voiced in one of the video pieces, that painting one's car orange, by hand, was acceptable. At least one cardboard and concrete construc- tion collapsed during the show. Yet the overall feeling of the installation was not only invigorating but satisfying: a particular and positive aesthetic was at work. Outside the gallery a Sixties-style sign read, 'DON'T HATE SCULPT'. There was parody of old art too at Keith Coventry's show at The Showroom (closed 16th November). Huddled together on the floor were what appeared to be the two heads cut from Henry Moore's King and Queen (a piece installed at Glenkillen in Scot- land and recently vandalised in just this way).

Further dysfunc- tionalised images were park benches with the slats removed and a giant riot-smashed shop window - all cast in bronze. In recent years the attention of British sculptors has increasingly shifted from object-making to installations or projects. One curious example was Mark Wallinger's presentation at the Canary Wharf Win- dow venue (closed 31st October) of four electric model trains in four different shop windows going round in circles at different speeds, each beneath a clock. The append- ed names Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John supposedly turn our thoughts to a religious sense of time, redemption and rebirth but probably just serve to befuddle the passing businessmen. A far richer example was the exhibition by Tacita Dean of three films and assorted conceptual pieces at Frith Street Gallery (closed 26th October). The centre- piece of this was a postcard framed and dis- creetly placed at the bottom of the staircase. It depicted Donald Crowhurst, the man who set sail on a race around the world in 1968 but, realising his yacht was inade- quate, sailed instead in circles around the Sargasso sea getting obsessed with time and God (as the logbook from his abandoned boat records). Eventually, terrified of returning to England as a cheat and a fail- ure, he committed suicide. Dean's two major films projected here Disappearance at sea land IIrefer to the Crowhurst narrative, though only elliptically. In the first we see the sunset reflected in the revolving glasses of Berwick lighthouse: it is a hypnotic and spectacular experience in which we too lose a definite sense of time and place in space. The second film - in cinemascope made at the Farne islands lighthouse - shows us the seascape as the light revolves. One of the beautiful and evocative texts the artist has written for the catalogue2 refers to Tristan and his voyage de guerison. The third film, Delft hydraulics, shows a wave machine - the sur- face of the water undulating in a curve of exquisite beauty. All these are works about time as much as movement in space; and this is true also of a sound piece in which one heard (so faintly that one strained to catch the words), a recording of Dean as she searches vainly to find that most mythic of twentieth-century sculptures, Robert Smithson's Spiral jetty. One generalisation it seems safe to make about British sculpture at the moment is that the representation of the human figure has become extremely problematic except as an imposture or an absence (the work of John Davies and Anthony Gormley remains atypical). In Germany however there are sculptors who can both view the figure as other than an absence and feel the need to do so. Perhaps this is because West Germans have traditionally had a deeper philosophical humanist commitment to the figure. Nevertheless these figures often appear beleaguered, embarrassed, veiled in irony or fantasy, as was clear in Pia Stadt- baumer's enlarged, reduced, intervened-in, replicated, pierced and wax-cast bodies or body parts shown at Delfina (closed 23rd November).3 They had the cold accuracy of medical models (Fig.67). It was equally evi- dent in the sculptures at the exhibition of six young German artists at the Saatchi Gallery (closed 23rd November). Not that it is clear to what extent we are to see humanism in Martin Honert's figures, for example the small boy sitting at the vast table, his face pensive and painted in shad- ow, as though there were no connexion between the life around him and the life inside him. Again, in Honert's spectral Mirage (1996; Fig.66), delicately poised between symbolism and kitsch, how much earnest allegory is intended? How much like humans can we read Thomas Schutte's ghost figures, giants in silvery cast alumini- um that seem as insubstantial and blobby as something formed from shaving foam? How far can we empathise with Thomas Grunfeld's mutated stuffed animals - a swan with the paws and back of a rabbit, a sheepdog with a sheep's head? Though these things remain uncertain, one suspects that Grunfeld's miscegenation of species is found more disturbingly resonant in Ger- many than in Britain.
