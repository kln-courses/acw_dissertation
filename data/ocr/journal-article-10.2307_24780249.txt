<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hostility to Myth: Chesterton and His Contemporaries JOHN DAVID COATES Chesterton's views of myth and fable, clearly central to his religious beliefs and his literary criticism, while intrinsically interesting, command attention also for the light they throw on his contemporaries. They reveal deficiencies of theorizing in the fields of myth and comparative religion and limitations in current canons of taste and expectations within "serious" literature. Chesterton's attempt to correct errors in the way in which ancient or primi tive societies were being viewed involved a defense of the popular culture of his day in certain of its instinctive preferences about life and writing. It is quite natural, though I believe incorrect, to regard his views as personal intuitions and to ignore their background in controversy. One gains greatly by knowing what he was reacting against or attempting to answer. Placing Chesterton's views in their intellectual context enhances the value of those views but it also illuminates an aspect of the culture of the time. Beneath many complex details, there are two substantial features in this intellectual context; the change of direction in the study of myth, connected in England with the work of Max Müller; and in literature, the develop ments typified, among much else, by George Eliot's novels and Henry James's criticism, toward an enhanced status for the novel, toward increasingly "adult," sophisticated, "mature" fictional concerns and to self-consciousness about form. These two broad areas of change, although of course they found expression in very many disparate phenomena, might be said to have Mosaic XV/4 0027-1276-82/010091-15J01.50 cMosaic</page><page sequence="2">92 John David Coates a common impulse behind them, a movement of the cultivated away from primitive or popular conceptions or expectations. The change of direction in the study of mythology is the more easily dated and formulated of the two. Ernst Cassirer, looking back in 1923,1 remarked that, unlike the romantics who, following Herder and Schelling, had seen language as faded mythology, the "comparative mythology" of Max Müller adopted a methodology which was based on linguistic comparison. Cassirer goes on to suggest that Müller mistook the convenience of a methodology for its objective truth. Whatever may be the case, parts of that methodology are still in use in the study of myth. Lévi-Strauss, as much as Max Müller, though in a far more sophisticated fashion, interprets myth through analogies drawn from language, admittedly from linguistic structures, rather than philology. Chesterton's studies of myth, lacking as they do a scientific terminology, may perhaps seem amateurish and subjective. Here, too, the modern reader inherits attitudes and expectations which were coalescing in the period around Chesterton's birth. It was another effect of Max Müller's writings with their intimidating multiplicity of detail to introduce this "scientific" frame of reference in the latter half of the nineteenth century, to make it appropriate or even obligatory. The success of Müller might be regarded as the success of a methodology. It was also, probably, a reaction to those over-emotional obscurantist elements in the German romantics' view of folk lore and myth: their inflated and anti-rational claims, noted by Isaiah Berlin,2 for primitive wisdom and the primal sensibility. One has besides only to note the vague poetic afflatus, almost rhapsody, of the translation (1827) of Herder's Treatise on the Origin of Language,21 to realize how such writing on myth would seem lacking both in facts and method, compared to Müller. Perhaps these excesses both of matter and manner explain the vulnera bility of the German romantic view of myth, hitherto the most developed and enthusiastic, to rational and scientific attack. Müller, as the editor of the 1909 edition of Comparative Mythology pointed out, was pre-eminently a clear and temperate writer, his involved terminology and vast information gracefully and lucidly presented.4 What this clarity reveals is a very definite set of attitudes both cultural and religious. Max Müller is remarkably honest and direct in expressing his revulsion from the grotesque element in early myths. In the seminal and highly influential essay Comparative Mythology (1856), for example, he remarks on the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the beginnings of religious laws or political societies in early communities, of which it is possible to form some picture, and the preceding stage of myth making. How is it possible to believe that the rich culture of the Greeks at the dawn of history could have been antedated by "a race of men whose chief amusement consisted in inventing absurd tales about gods and other nondescript beings?"5 Later poets may have lent some of these fables a degree of charm but most of them, taken literally, are absurd and irrational. So great is the difference between the mind which created and delighted in</page><page sequence="3">Chesterton and Myth 93 them and the later achievements of Greek moral and religious thought that one might almost believe that there was "a period of temporary insanity through which the human mind had to pass" (p. 309). His own argument for a derivation of myth from language seems to offer an alternative to the "violent and repugnant theory" of repeated catastrophes due to upheavals from the depths of human consciousness—a notion which must clearly render a reasoned account of man's intellectual development impossible. Müller's explanations of myth, widely challenged in their own day and rapidly superseded, are less interesting and significant than the religious or philosophical premise which underlies them. Expressed with an unguarded ingenuousness by the founding father of comparative mythology in English, it appears in a more cautious form in his more sophisticated successors such as Frazer or Gilbert Murray. It is essentially the distaste of a civilized man for the primitive and for fable, an inability to see how the latter could possibly have any kind of religious significance. Müller's language is that of repugnance bordering on disgust. How, he asks, can one believe that a few generations before Solon and Lykurgos the Greeks expressed their highest notion of the Godhead by the story of Kronos and Uranos, almost as disgusting as anything found among "the lowest tribes of Africa" (Essays, p. 311). Traced to its source, Müller's reaction stems from his judgment of the nature of religious experience. Reverently interested in spirituality, he felt it far transcended those regions of the mind in which language had its origin. Myth and metaphor he saw as parasites twining around the sense of the holy but it was always possible to glimpse the original stem of these "rank and poisonous growths of mythic phraseology" (Essays, pp. 524-26). Indeed, one might even be indulgent to myth as an outgrown, puerile phenomenon : "Those who spoke of God as walking about in Paradise spoke as children, did the best they could, gave all they had, and who shall say that their two mites were in the sight of God less precious than all our creeds and philosophies."6 Müller resists the whole idea of story or myth in a religious context, as part of a wider distaste for any giving of spiritual experience a local habitation and a name; as far as he is concerned, to do so constitutes a degradation. What is possibly most disconcerting is that these attitudes affect Müller's approach to the subject in which he achieved greatest distinction. It is surely, as his recent biographer Nirad Chaudhuri points out,7 on his pioneer work in the field of Hindu myth and religion that Müller's reputation now rests. Through his energy in personal contacts in Oxford and through his inde fatigable efforts as an editor, he might be said to have been the founder of this whole field of study. For him, however, Hindu myth was a revelation of human weakness rather than a fascinating kingdom of the imagination, proof of the irresistible force of language as applied to supernatural and abstract ideas (Essays, pp. 381-82). Müller, as Chaudhuri points out, colored the mind of his time like Darwin or Einstein (p. 7).</page><page sequence="4">94 John David Coates Although, as is well-known, the study of myth turned more and more to anthropology in the years immediately before and after the First War, the imprint of Müller's initial distrust of primitive story-telling was retained. There appeared to be no questioning of that division which was Müller's psycho logical and moral starting point: the gulf between an exalted and spiritual religion on the one hand and stories as concrete embodiments of religious insights and experience on the other. Nor is there any challenge to the assumption that myth is inferior to the pure and direct intimation of the holy. Frazer devotes several pages to establishing such a hierarchy of value as the point of departure for The Golden Bough. He draws a sharp distinction, throughout an entire chapter, between "magic" and "religion." The former involves the attempt of men to "force the great powers of nature to do their pleasure," and the origin of the dying and resurrected God, scapegoat and sacrifice and its periphery of attendant figures and related stories; far removed from this, the latter is a subsequent and ethically much higher development, "a perfect submission to the divine will in all things" and an imitation, so far as human imperfection allows, of God's moral nature. Frazer speaks of religion, as he defines it, with great respect; of magic, and the myths which he believes embody it, in a tone either patronising or openly contemptuous. It and they retain their hold among "the dull, the weak, the ignorant, and the superstitious, who constitute, unfortunately, the vast majority of mankind." The mythopoeic temper, connected with a belief in the efficacy of magic, is a standing menace to civilization, a solid layer of savagery among the subterranean masses throughout the world, barely held in check by the cultured and intelligent few who maintain civilized standards, reason and morals. Frazer's sense of his own superiority to the mind of the primitive savage and that of the contemporary populace, which are indeed fundamentally the same, is expressed with an innocent directness: "One of the great achievements of the nineteenth century was to run shafts down into this low mental stratum in many parts of the world and thus dis cover its substantial identity everywhere. It is beneath our feet.. ."(p. 17). Behind any particular doubts or difficulties in the contemporary views of myth, or any specific points in them Chesterton might have wished to take up, lies the great dilemma of a cultural split to which they bear witness. They express with peculiar militancy the views of a selfconsciously intellec tual minority. Müller and Frazer advance very different explanations of myth, but in both writers the opening terms of their arguments are dictated by a distrust of story, of the concrete embodiment of the supernatural. For Frazer the impulse behind myth, and for Müller its incidental features, excites distaste. In the leading figures of the anthropological school which dominated Edwardian as opposed to Victorian views of myth—Gilbert Murray and Jane Harrison—there is no such overt expression of distaste for the primitive imagination, for fable and for the concrete realization and personification of the supernatural. The devaluation of the appetite for fable is more subtle, and more effective. For Murray, "religion" is the inevitable relationship a</page><page sequence="5">Chesterton and Myth 95 man must have to the uncharted tracts of life, involving his whole being rather than simply the conscious reason. What is gained from it is a precious possession, hard to define, but lying at the "heart not only of religion, but of art and poetry and all the higher strivings of human emotion," and which provides practical guidance in some questions where experience and argu ment fail.9 Where Jane Harrison was sympathetic to the primitive mind and its "religion of fear,"10 however, Murray, who popularized her work, was not. His tone was harder and more categorical, and his influence much greater. Although he accepted the religious impulse, to him the solid particularity and concreteness of the way in which the Greeks saw their gods was a very lowly element, a proof of lack of imagination, rather than its vigorous use (p. 10). Of course, this effect of "normal human laziness" was fortified and adorned by literary art of a high order in Homer. If, however, we penetrate behind "these gods of the artist's workshop and the romance-maker's imagination" (p. 11), we find entirely different conceptions. In the age of highest civiliza tion, "the religious thinkers of the great period" have conceptions of God which are subtle and rarified, not easy for primitive man to grasp. In the mind of primitive man is found not the God of the philosophers, nor the anthropomorphic gods and heroes of the myths embellished by artists in a literary culture, but "collective desire" and "collective dread" concentrated "on two things, the food supply and the tribe-supply, the desire not to die of famine and not to be harried or conquered by a neighbouring tribe" (p. 27). Murray's account suggests that these straightforward physical needs and the placatory rites to which they give birth are the roots of the religious impulse. The advent of the Olympian Gods, the second of the "five stages" of Greek religion, represents a moral expurgation and a bringing of intellec tual order, reducing to a minimal remnant the rites connected with food supply and tribe-supply. Finally, Murray remarks, in a passage which expli citly and interestingly reveals his sympathies, "the Olympian movement swept away also for two splendid centuries, the worship of the man-god, with its diseased atmosphere of megalomania and blood lust. These things return after the fall of Hellenism" (p. 60). Philosophy and the molding of beautiful anthropomorphic creations in art and myth are the result of a temporary victory of human reason and dignity. The appeal of myth is not that it is a fundamental human impulse or need. Its attractiveness is a quality imparted by gifted artists in a minority culture. The fears of the masses wait to return and swamp this higher civilization of the elite, and the rise of Christianity and its rival oriental cults are, in Murray's well-known phrase, simply "the failure of nerve." A glance at the point of departure for some of the most important studies of myth before and during Chesterton's career is interesting in several ways. It reveals, for one thing, the arbitrariness and fragility of the assumptions on which professional careers and academic frames of reference have been founded. For another, it suggests that the faults within a discipline may well lie in assumptions, especially cultural attitudes, rather than in a failure of</page><page sequence="6">96 John David Coates scholarly procedures or factual accuracy. Precision over dates and references was not Chesterton's strongest point, as undoubtedly it was Midler's. How ever, his apparent instinct to turn away from minute scholarship to look rather at structures of feeling, the premises to his arguments, the unspoken or unspecified backgrounds or contexts of the views he combatted, may often have been adequately justified. This is rarely more striking than in the case of his work on myth. In important respects, the assumptions behind Midler's, Frazer's and Murray's writings are similar. Historically, they are, of course, curiously dated, very much linked to the temporary dominance of Western Europe over Africa and Asia. In Frazer's case, Edmund Leach has explicitly pointed to The Golden Bough as an apology for colonialism, representing "savages" as stupid." While such a criticism may be applicable to Frazer, however, it hardly seems fair to the radical anti-imperialist Gilbert Murray. Perhaps it is sounder to place these writers within a cultural rather than a simple political context. They illustrate a fear and suspicion of the beauties and satisfactions of fable and unite in denying that myth-making is a joyful act of creation, valuable at a "primitive level." They refuse to accept or discuss it as a primal human urge. Related to this, in each of them, there appears to be a distaste for popular, that is to say concrete, embodiments of religious experience. Under lying all their responses to the question of myth one can detect the reaction of an embattled intellectual minority against the mass. If one notes the literary, as opposed to the religious or anthropological climate in which Chesterton undertook his work on myth, the case is strengthened for believing that his greatest problem was bridging a con temporary cultural division. In The Defendant essays, which launched him before the public, he devoted himself to the defense of popular culture and specifically to those mythic elements of the art of fiction which had been rejected by the educated—in particular by those who heralded the novel form's rise to dominance. George Eliot's declaration of the nature and scope of her art in Adam Bede and Henry James's essay on The Art of Fiction, to name the most obvious examples, announce a change of direction, intended to make the novel fully adult, suitable for an intelligent mature reader, for a serious criticism of life. Involved in the new claims, for Eliot,12 are the relin quishing of the tendency to transcend experience, to render it as more beauti ful or mysterious than it is, to dress it in that "glamour" which Chesterton in The Victorian Age in Literature criticized her for lacking.13 It is easy, she says, to draw a griffin, much harder and more worthwhile to render things as they are in the light of common day. For James what must be sacrificed are the thrilling qualities of fiction, the long, involved, exciting plots which stir curiosity rather than the faculty of moral and psychological discrimina tion and which overturn the design necessary in finished art. Both of these programs for the novel's future involve surrendering what Chesterton later singled out as those very traits which make for a sense of timelessness in</page><page sequence="7">Chesterton and Myth 97 prose narrative and escape from a sense of bondage to time and circumstance. They are the qualities of epic and of myth; absorption, exaltation, celebra tion, satisfactions basic to story-telling from its earliest history. In his time, as Chesterton tried to show, it was only in Penny-Dreadfuls and Detective stories, despised and banished by the educated, that the remnants of these vital fictive concerns still lingered on. Chesterton encountered the distaste for myth as a mode of discourse in specific tasks he set himself. Obviously his first work on Dickens (1906) can scarcely be fully understood unless it is seen, in very considerable part, as a reaction to the study George Gissing had published a little before (1898). It is not an attack on Gissing personally but a controversial book taking issue with a spokesman of the advanced literary culture of the time. The most significant matter of debate is the function and value of myth and fable in writing. Gissing, mentioned by name at important points in Charles Dickens, is the implied adversary throughout Chesterton's effort to establish the opening terms of his debate, his frame of reference. Gissing may be seen as the counterpart, in the purely literary field, of the cultural limitations embodied by Müller, Frazer and Murray in comparative mythology. He pro vides a representative example of the other half of the context necessary to a fuller understanding of Chesterton's view of myth and fable. Charles Dickens: A Critical Study offers a reasoned and weighty defense of its subject, a plea for considering him seriously as an artist. Gissing him self assumes, and takes it that his readers will feel, that exaggeration, fantasy, fable, the mythic are inadmissible. His tactic is to prove that everything that resembles them in Dickens' writing is really something else. Dickens' charac ters are not like "figures in the Old Moralities," a kind of art Gissing takes to be indefensible. They are aggressively individual people of a certain time, not abstractions, since abstractions "do not take hold upon the memory." 14 The secret of their power lies in their "actuality." True, they may at times seem strange, but eccentrics and grotesques were more common sixty years before in that repellent period of which every aspect was ugly, although this had been alleviated by the growth of culture between Dickens' early years and Gissing's own. Dickens represents the "later school of English fiction." By "taking hold upon the life nearest to him, making use of it for literature and proving that it was of interest" (p. 68), he initiated that kind of social realism of which Gissing himself was a practitioner. Indeed, had the word then been in use, Dickens would certainly have called himself a Realist. Admittedly there were fairy-story or non-realistic elements in his novels but they were a mere concession to popular taste. Gissing roundly condemns Dickens at the point where he was most rooted in the popular art and sensibility of the times: in those plays of sentiment and melodrama which dominated the theaters and commanded huge audi ences until the "reforms" and realism associated with Tom Robertson, the Bancrofts and Pinero. The exaggeration, histrionics, rhetoric and feeling which are inseparable from this kind of art are, in Gissing's view, simply bad :</page><page sequence="8">98 John David Coates "Dickens' love for the stage was assuredly a misfortune to him as an author and man" (p. 40). Such a view naturally enough determines Gissing to see successful characterization as successes of the realistic method, of exact social observation: "Bagstock and Toots represent quite as truthfully figures possible in a certain class, as do Thackeray's characters in another" (p. 82). Gissing avoids the problems of his frame of reference by deft maneuvers in specific instances. Realism is the highest kind of art, perhaps the only admissible kind. Dickens is clearly of the highest quality. Therefore Dickens must be a realist. Exaggeration and the fabulous are bad. Dickens cannot then really exaggerate. Instead, he must report. How, then, can one explain Mrs. Gamp? She is, he insists, realistic: "a sick nurse, living in Kingsgate Street, Holburn, in a filthy room somewhere upstairs...a very loathsome creature; a sluttish, drunken, avaricious, dishonest woman" (p. 83). So repulsive is she, that Dickens, in order to render her acceptable to persons of good taste, makes her funny. This tortuous reasoning is worth noting not only because Gissing's book is one of the immediate occasions of Chesterton's Dickensian studies, but also as an instance of the lengths to which an able writer may be driven to reconcile intransigent facts he cannot avoid with artistic premises he will not abandon. Curiously and revealingly, Gissing does, at least once, touch the frontiers of the mythic but he does so in a fashion which shows he finds the subject jejune. He remarks of Pickwick that one may "discourse about it in good set terms, pointing out that it belongs to a very old school of narrative and indicating resemblances with no less a work than Don Quixote," if, presumably, one finds such an approach worth pursuing, or such an "old school of narrative" worth talking about, both of which seem doubtful (p. 38). Not surprisingly, Gissing greatly prefers the later Dickens, especially Little Dorrit, which may be more easily accommodated to his literary criteria. This novel he views as the adult, as opposed to the childish Dickens, critical terms which are themselves symptomatic. The reason is plain. In this book Dickens has "comparatively little of his wonted buoyancy" (p. 81). The impression Gissing's study gives is an odd one. The points he makes are not indefensible in themselves but he is unwilling or unable wholeheartedly to enjoy Dickens. He must excuse or defend by strained arguments and in an inappropriate idiom what is most vital and attractive in the Dickens world: its mythic quality. Gissing's problem is his own artistic ideology. Perhaps one's misgivings about the words missing from his vocabulary, or the conceptions absent from his mental landscape, arise particularly in relation to his description of Mr. Sapsea's epitaph on his wife in Edwin Drood. His remark that in this case Dickens has been "guilty of a piece of exaggeration altogether exceeding the limits of art" (p. 117) epitomizes the prevailing tendency of his own analysis. He is plainly embarrassed by the exuberant, the larger than life, the escape of the human personality from the limits of "real" time, "real" circumstance, verisimilitude. Beneath the critical vocabulary Gissing employs, as beneath</page><page sequence="9">Chesterton and Myth 99 the scholarly apparatus of Müller, Frazer and Murray, lurks a "religious" or philosophical attitude. With him, as with them, it is neither demonstrated nor argued. It is simply assumed. Chesterton was not unique in grasping the importance of the cultural split which had developed in the later nineteenth century. It has been plausibly argued that much of Kipling's inspiration and popularity stemmed from understanding it and from exploiting some of the literary potential of popular sensibility and artistic forms: "In pointed defiance of the preciosity of the 'l'art pour l'art' school he chose to model himself on the ballad maker who functioned as the mere vehicle of folk memory and whose aim was to convey to ordinary men the truths implicit in their own experience."15 The comparison with Chesterton is an illuminating one. Kipling, unlike Chesterton, approached the field as a series of questions about technique, of what he as an artist could get out of the deliberate cultivation of vulgarity, the meter or spirit of music hall, the linguistic resources of slang. He is not concerned to explore the philosophical or religious implications of the gulf he is bridging in his often extremely fruitful raids into another consciousness. The spoils are enough, for him and his readers. At the limits of his mind there does exist, somewhat poignantly, an intimation of the "mythic" or "fabulous" quality of the material he utilized.16 As far as Kipling has a terminology to express this intimation about his material, it is that of astrology—which does not really fit the case. In the passage just referred to, something beyond the external facts of experience is certainly announced but it cannot be particularized. Kipling's few attempts to explore the mythic are undeveloped, largely perhaps because of his inadequate terminology and his lack of a grasp of general ideas. Comparison with Kipling reveals the nature of the contribution Chesterton was peculiarly equipped to make. He was strong in the area where Kipling was weakest, the ability to take an argument back fruitfully to first principles, to expose the opening terms of his contemporaries' account of, or failure to account for, myth in thought and in literature. These qualities may be seen in A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls which, like the other defenses of popular culture in Chesterton's first important book, is concerned to expose buried but living traditions, slighted by the educated elite, neglect of which upsets the balance of their view of life. Chesterton connects the "invisible dramatis personae" of the child's first imaginary world, the professional storyteller of the east, the ballads of Robin Hood and the boys' comics of his own time as manifestations of a fictive urge more significant and universal than the esthetic ideals and concerns of the few, or than the rules of good art. To Chesterton, the comics are not some new manifestation of cultural degeneration or declining standards. The story-telling impulse has always existed and has no necessary connection with form, construction or technique, the hall-marks of high art. "Literature and fiction are two entirely different things. Literature is a luxury : fiction is a necessity." Literature is written to</page><page sequence="10">100 John David Coates show the author's wit or skill, as a tour-de-force, or for the satisfaction of making an object as perfect as possible. Fiction, on the other hand, celebrates the sense of timelessness and freedom. The impulses behind them are too different for fruitful comparison: "A work of art can hardly be too short, for its climax is its merit. A story can never be too long, for its conclusion is merely to be deplored." The "increase in the artistic conscience" tends more and more to brevity and impressionism. The popular myths, whether of Robin Hood or Dick Deadshot, have no end since "these two heroes are deliberately conceived as immortal."17 This last remark is not a casual verbal flourish. Chesterton quite clearly connects fiction, in his meaning of the term, with a sense of, or hunger for, the supernatural, for immortality in fact. The distinction, drawn in A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls, is developed and deepened five years later, in the chapter on The Pickwick Papers in Charles Dickens, one of the most cogent and attractive of Chesterton's early dis cussions of myth. This important account opens by pinpointing the mythic element under lying Dickens' creation, the fact that the surface movement and machinery of the novels are intended to display static character.18 Colonel Newcome, in Thackeray's realistic novel, lives in the medium of time. Pickwick does not. To most modern readers this will seem praise of Thackeray, criticism of Dickens: "But this only shows how few modern people understand Dickens. It also shows how few people understand the faiths and fables of mankind" (p. 67). Myth and fable are, in one of their essential aspects, a celebration of timelessness, a quality retained in the "fading supernaturalism" of much popular literature: "The popular preference for a story with a happy ending is not, or at least was not, a mere sweet-stuff optimism; it is the remains of the old idea of the triumph of the dragon-slayer, the ultimate apotheosis of the man beloved of heaven" (p. 69). Where old myth and its contemporary traces (the latter "stormed at by silly magistrates, sneered at by silly school masters") escape mortality, the literature of the educated minority is in thrall to it. This new "literature" is really a very recent and somewhat curious phenomenon, a fancy for writing down our own or similar lives in order to look at them. "It imitates not only life, but the limitations of life; it not only reproduces life, it reproduces death" (p. 68). The preference for the short story in modern writing is not "an accident of form" but has its roots in religious or philosophical attitudes: "It is the sign of a real sense of fleeting ness and fragility" (p. 69). Realistic "mature" literature is concerned with limits. Myth, fable or folklore extend "quite normal desires" beyond such limitations. The first mode of narrative is endorsed as adult and intellectually respectable by those who form educated opinion. The second is condemned. But both endorsement and condemnation are the result of metaphysical assumptions about the nature of reality. They are also, Chesterton feels, partly casued by inhibition; by an inability to enjoy or to accept a common experience of heightened reality; by a failure, in some at least, to appreciate the meaning of those occasions when the</page><page sequence="11">Chesterton and Myth 101 "god-like" shows itself. The often-quoted passage in which this point is made is not, perhaps, what it looks out of context, a praise of conviviality or alcoholic expansiveness. Rather it is a hint of what Mircea Eliade has called the "Great Time" or the "Paradisiac state": "To every man alive, one must hope, it has in some manner happened that he has talked with his more fascinating friends round a table on some night when all the numerous personalities unfolded themselves like great tropical flowers. All fell into their parts as in some delightful impromptu play. Every man was more himself than he had ever been in this vale of tears" (p. 71). These normal and natural visitations of ecstasy, of a reality behind what daily routine or material circumstances allow to appear, are a hint of the appetite which makes myths and ensures that "the whole moral world is a factory of immortals." The important point is not that personality is unreal or an illusion. It is more real, more stable and strongly defined, more joyfully itself than habits or mundane events and worries allow it to appear. A problem in understanding this part of the mythic impulse is the fading in the modern educated mind of the desire for endless or timeless joy, of the life that lasts forever: "Both popular religion with its endless joys and the old comic story with its endless jokes, have in our time faded together. We are too weak to desire that undying vigour. We believe you can have too much of a good thing." Chesterton sees the process which brings mythologizing to an end not in the manner of his contemporaries as a loss of superstitious awe, or of the sense of mystery under the onset of reason or science, a regrettable or admirable process but, in any case, an inevitable one; rather it is the difficult psychological problem of the loss of a love of life in many educated men of his own time: "We have come to be afraid of an eternity of joy" (p. 72). Clearly one does not wish for more, and more abundant, life if one does not greatly care for life in the first place. It is easy, therefore, to see why Chesterton in attempting to answer Gissing's misinterpretation of Dickens, his undervaluing of myth, should concentrate initially on the matter of joy. Incidentally, of course, as Chesterton points out, Gissing sees the early Dickens period as hard and cruel because he omits the note of hope born of a new post-1789 attitude toward the value of the common man and popular culture and aspiration: "Its education, its public habits, its rhetoric were all addressed towards encouraging the greatness in everybody" (p. 14). It is, to some extent, the waning of this liberal tide after 1870 which cuts a despondent intelligentsia off from a sense of the value of ordinary life, of the generality of men and their creative possibilities, and of the popular roots of myth. Chesterton remarks in a political context that "the note of the last few decades in art and ethics has been that man is stamped with an irrevocable psychology and is cramped for perpetuity in the prison of his own skull" (p. 18). Beyond the political and social lie the moral, emotional and psychological aspects of the problem: the loss of a capacity in many of Chesterton's generation for creating myths and appreciating a mythic art like that of Dickens. There has been a withering of the urge to</page><page sequence="12">102 John David Coates endless celebratory stories, to the heightening and extension of experience in heroic cycles, or toward imagining characters outside time. Here, the difficulty at heart is a habit of sadness. Chesterton exhorts his educated readers, if they are to understand a mythic art, at least in imagination, to "surrender the very flower of your culture; give up the very jewel of your pride; abandon hopelessness all ye who enter here" (p. 24). It is surely not accidental that in considering this art—where plot is an "invocation for calling down a god"—Chesterton should single out as expressing the essential Dickens, Mr. Sapsea's epitaph on his wife which Gissing, in contrast, had used to illustrate Dickens' excess or failure. Deliberately rebutting Gissing's conception of reality, Chesterton observes: "You could scarcely have such immortal folly as that in a world where there is also death. Mr. Sapsea is one of the golden things stored up for us in a better world" (p. 179). The groundwork of Chesterton's working out of his philosophy of myth both embodies and displays the value of the dichotomy in his nature. Clearly Chesterton had two sides, both of which were brought into play in his consideration of myth to achieve a peculiarly comprehensive and balanced view of the subject. When one remembers the deficiencies and dangers of the intellectual context against which he worked these qualities of inclusiveness and sanity are specially notable. One side of Chesterton has received ample notice : the rational Chesterton with his stress on the concreteness of things, on reason, logic, form and definition, on order and the "Roman heritage." The other side, though a little less well-known, is no less important; the Chesterton of the grotesque, of myth, fable, folklore and story, of the non verbal language of Manalive, who was convinced that life and reality are mysteriously themselves, not explicable by reason or categorization—being, in essence, more like a fable than a logical sequence. Chesterton needed both of the chief weapons of his intellectual armory, since he was fighting a war on two fronts. On the first of these he had to insist on the validity of myth against scholars such as Müller who saw the Rig Veda as the first stage in the development of the Aryan mind toward its fulfillment in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (that is, scholars who saw myth as only a feeble anticipation of philosophy) and against literary critics like Gissing who viewed myth only as childish intrusions or lapses in the presentation of "reality." In his fight against these tendencies Chesterton emphasized the rights of fable to a place of honor in the minds and culture of men: "The only two things that can satisfy the soul are a person and a story; and even a story must be about a person. There are indeed very voluptuous appetites and enjoyments in mere abstractions—like mathematics, logic or chess. But these mere pleasures of the mind are like mere pleasures of the body. That is, they are mere pleasures... they can never by mere increase of themselves amount to happiness."19 Myth is not an outmoded first glimmering of philosophy or of a more "spiritual" religion. It does not stand for or symbolize the ultimate reality which is the external world. Instead, external objects symbolize the ultimate reality which is spiritual.</page><page sequence="13">Chesterton and Myth 103 In his first sustained examination of the nature of the moral intuitions which fable and popular folk tales offer, The Ethics ofElfland, he claims that the mythic view presents a truer picture of the world because unlike a materialist science it has no simple belief in the "law" of cause and effect. The sense of wonder, from which myth springs and to which it ministers, might be called a "higher agnosticism" since it does not try to impose on an essentially mysterious universe as a law what is merely an association of two events—the faulty notion that "because one incomprehensible thing con stantly follows another incomprehensible thing the two somehow make up a comprehensible thing."20 The sharp feeling of amazement the fables evoke is part of a mythic art which tries to touch a nerve gone dead, a primal sense of wonder which is the first and truest reaction to experience. This wonder, like the feeling of timelessness, is forgotten in the delusive sense of life as normal, ordinary or routine : "All that we call common sense and practicality and positivism only means that for certain dead levels of our life we forget that we have forgotten. All that we call spirit and art and ecstasy only means that for one awful moment we remember that we forget" (p. 53). I have confined myself in this essay to part of the controversial context of Chesterton's early view of myth, that governed by the literary and philosophical hostility to mythic apprehension. Obviously, however, it is necessary to appreciate the other front on which he was fighting to realize the phenomenon of displaced or perverted myth as a dominant factor in shaping his views toward their mature expression in The Everlasting Man. The second half of the context would require an essay to itself. It is also, perhaps, more familiar to the reader of Chesterton. Paradoxically, though hostile to myth and fable as the spontaneous creations and expressions of popular feelings, apprehensions and moral intuitions, the climate of the whole of Chesterton's career was exceedingly indulgent to myths fostered by intellectuals themselves. It is a truism that history and scientific and social thought in his time were dominated by myths which were not recognized as such. Chesterton, the advocate of myth in its true role and right place, was the implacable opponent of the displaced or perverted mythopoeic faculty in action, which increasingly produced much of what passed for thought during his later years. One need only recall his attacks on the Superman and eugenics, on doctrines of racial superiority and inferiority, on the abuses of evolutionary theory, on the historicism which proved the "inevitable" rise or decline of civilizations—all of which colored the minds of very many of his contemporaries. His position in challenging these obsessions relied on logic and reason. He questioned the premises and connecting links in the arguments which supported these "myths" and pointed out fallacies and non-sequiturs. He defended philosophy against mythopoeic insult as he had buttressed myth against intellectual contempt. The unfolding of Chesterton's thought on this subject is toward a balance of reason and imagination, fable and philosophy. The Everlasting Man is, of course, the point where this is fully treated, becoming, in fact, the focus for a</page><page sequence="14">104 John David Coates sketch of human thought and history. It offers, among much else, a sympathetic but not uncritical picture of the mind of the "philosophers," an "intellectual aristocracy" with a delight in theorizing and a prevailing temptation to insane simplifications—the cast of mind, in effect, of Chesterton's early adversaries in his defense of myth. But it also represents the conclusion of that other defense, of objective fact and of logic against perverted myth, a degenerate hybrid of imagination and impulses of fatalism, boredom and the hunger for power and quick results. Chesterton examines the limits of both the mythic and the reasoning faculty, their need to be joined in a synthesis, their need, above all, for an objective conclusion, fulfilling both the stories and the theories, satisfying and bringing into harness two impulses which otherwise could never meet and which wrongly denied each other's validity. At first, his final view of myth may seem cautious, compared with the first defenses of Penny-Dreadfuls and of the art of Dickens, but it is conditioned partly by a different polemical need, partly by a wish to strike a balance between the two divergent impulses. There is a sense in which his description of the last stages of the pagan world seems appropriate to the cultural spilt to which he was opposed in his own time: "Mythology is a search-, it is something that combines a recurrent desire with a recurrent doubt, mixing a most hungry sincerity in the idea of seeking for a place with a most dark and deep and mysterious levity about all the places found. So far could the lonely imagina tion lead, and we must turn later to the lonely reason. Nowhere along this road did the two ever travel together."21 NOTES 1/ Ernst Cassirer, Language and Myth, in Mythology: Selected Readings, ed.
