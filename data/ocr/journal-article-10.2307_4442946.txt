<plain_text><page sequence="1">THUS LIFE BEGAN, by Allan Broms. 1968. Doubleday &amp; Co., New York. ix + 326 pp. $5.95 Despite its somewhat presumptive title, Thus Life Began is a rather well- conceived book for two principal groups of readers. The layman will find in it an interesting summary of the events leading to contemporary frontiers of DNA research and to the heterotroph hypothesis, which is currently receiving popular news coverage. And most biol- ogy teachers should welcome the chance to brush up on some of the historical contributions of a great many individ- uals-contributions that led, by diverse yet pertinent paths, from the early con- cepts of spontaneous generation and Vitalism to the eventual formulation of the modern concept of evolution. The historical aspects seem to be well re- searched; they often include, as anec- dotal sidelights, happenings that influ- enced the development of ideas but are often overlooked. The book thus pos- sesses an interesting flavor without the boredom of detail. Broms seems to be rather weak in his basic organic chemistry and cell physi- ology; this may reflect, in many cases, the problem of over-simplification. Ex- amples of inaccurate statements are his two references to amino acid production by RNA. The first half of the book deals with the historical development of natural selection in its modern context. The second half attempts to outline a pos- sible evolutionary trail culminating in man; it reflects the modern consensus of scientific thought. Unfortunately, however, the approach to higher evolu- tionary development is seemingly based upon the "need" of the particular or- ganism to develop certain adaptations in order to survive or to "tend upward" (p. 305). Such anthropomorphic tele- ology may certainly be permissible among biologists well informed on the subject of evolution; but the target audience of this book is clearly not the biologist, and therefore such license seems unwarranted. Broms is obviously aware of the im- portance of genetic continuity and the role of mutation and natural selection in the evolution of species. However, he omits entirely the role of genetic drift and its importance, and he only implies the importance of genetic recombina- tion through sexual reproduction by referring to species vigor. All in all, I find the presentation valid. The book gives the biology teacher an opportunity to spice up the presenta- tion of material with interesting his- torical information that goes far beyond the scope of ordinary texts and yet is more than a chronology of events. In other books the teacher is usually sup- plied with bits and pieces of biological history which may not be coherently tied together; this book provides a syn- thesis of events and ideas, thus sparing the teacher the laborious task of time- consuming research.
