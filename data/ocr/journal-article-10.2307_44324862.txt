<plain_text><page sequence="1">QUEEN MAB AND AN ESSAY ON MAN : SCIENTIFIC PROPHECY VERSUS THEODICY By Dennis M. Welch Since its publication in 1813, several critics have noted parallels between Shelley's Queen Mab and Pope's Essay on Man (1733-34). One anonymous reviewer suggested that Mab "may, perhaps, be best defined as an 'Essay on Men' . . . Pope takes the individual, and minutely examines the part he plays, and the stage on which he acts. Shelley takes the species, and presents you with . . . the whole dramatis personae, in full and combined action."1 According to Ed- mund Blunden, the young poet found in An Essay both "encouragement to proceed with a philosophical poem [Queen Mab]" and "hints and supplies of subject matter."2 As William Fox - the probable author of a "Reply to the . . . Supposed Atheism of Percy Bysshe Shelley" - asserted, in portraying nature's spirit in Mab the poet "borrowed the same idea of divinity which Pope adopts: - ... a spirit that - 'Lives through all life, extends through all extent.' "3 Carlos Baker also has noted that "apostrophes to the spirit of nature in Queen Mab reflect . . . certain passages . . . from the Essay . . . And, according to Kenneth Cam- eron, the spirit of nature in Shelley's poem originated partly from his regard for verses 267-68 of the Essay's first epistle ("All are but parts of one stupendous whole 1 Wooler's British Gazette, 6 May 1821, pp. 143-44. * Shelley: A Life Story (New York: Viking, 1947), p. 105. 8 This review is reproduced in Newman Ivey White's The Unextinguished Hearth: Shelley and His Contemporary Critics (1938; rpt.

As the critics cited above indicate, Queen Mab and An Essay are philosophical poems. They deal with such closely related issues as the nature of God, creation and humanity, the social order, and history. In the following pages I com- pare and contrast the poems concerning these issues. My thesis is that Shelley reworked several ideas and images from the Essay in an effort to replace Pope's theodicy and its emphasis on order, hierarchy, and submission with a sci- entific prophecy based on Necessity, human potential, and evolutionary progress. His scientific voice speaks from the beginning of Mab, where he quotes Archimedes, who ex- amined the power of the lever. Whereas Pope claimed that "Whatever is, is right" (1.294), Shelley protested against the 5 An Essay on Man, ed. Maynard Mack, in The Poems of Alexander Pope, Twickenham Edition (New Haven: Yale Univ.

For the apparent date of Afaò's conception, see Letters, I, 201 and 189n3. On the basis of the following evidence, Neville Rogers argues that Shelley first conceptu- alized the poem in December 1810: (1) Mary Shelley's and the poet's assertions that he wrote Mab when he was eighteen years old (1810), and (2) his letter to Hogg on December 20, 1810, in which he said that he was "composing a Satricial [sic] Poem on L'infame." "L'infame" is an allusion to Voltaire's famous impera- tive "Ecrasez L'infame!" which Shelley used as an epigraph to Mab. The impera- tive refers to Christianity, which Mab condemned as Voltaire had. If Rogers' argu- ment is correct, then Shelley conceived his poem closer to the time of his admiration for Pope than Cameron supposed (pp. 265-66).

Welch ills in his society, striving like a new Archimedes for "some- where to stand" in order to "move the earth" toward a bet- ter society.8 According to Earl J. Schulze, "Shelley's 'pro- gressive state of more or less exalted existence,' a theme that he first employs in Queen Mab . . . does not so much compete with the religious dogma of the Church as with the religious imaginations of Dante, Milton, and Pope."® In Queen Mab the young poet accepted and rejected the ideas of several philosophers and poets. The following pages trace his record of acceptance and rejection regarding Pope's Es- say, a record of "competition" by a young, aspiring poet in relation to an established predecessor. I As William Fox, Carlos Baker, and Kenneth Cameron have suggested, Shelley derived the concept of divinity in Mab partly from the Essay. Certainly, his letter to Hogg in early January of 1811 reveals a fondness for the following description of divinity in Pope's work: All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Nature is, and God the soul; That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same, Great in the earth, as in th' aethereal frame, Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart .... (1.267-72, 275-76) Like Pope's God, Shelley's is a duality - the spirit in na- ture. As such, some of its activities are described by Queen Mab with strong verbs and half-lines reminiscent of the passage above. The spirit 8 Shelley: Poetical Works , ed.

(VI.157-59) Despite the similarities between this passage and the essay- ist's and despite the comments by Fox, Baker, and Cam- eron, Shelley's dualistic God differs from Pope's signifi- cantly, however. Whereas the essayist's deity pervades reality and yet transcends it, the young poet's God dwells entirely in nature as its "pervading Spirit co-eternal with the universe" (p. 812), inhabiting its "Innumerable sys- tems" (1.253; cf. VI.146, 171-72). The difference between these dualistic conceptions in- volved some eclectic revision by Shelley in search of a the- ology more persuasive and reassuring to him than his pred- ecessor's. Before and during the composition of Mab, he reconsidered the immanent and transcendent aspects of Pope's theology, finding them irreconcilable with each other and with the concept of Necessity that he was developing under the influence of Hume, Godwin, and Holbach. Pope tried to base God's immanence on the analogy that he re- lates to the world as man's soul relates to the body (1.268; III.22). But as Douglas White observes, "Numerous refer- ences in the Essay to heaven's forming and looking on at the world suggest that Pope did not intend to involve God so much in the world that he is not both apart from it and its maker."10 Shelley recognized the contradiction between such transcendence and divine immanence. In addition, he considered analogy an unconvincing method of proof for God's immanence. Under the influence of Hume's and God- win's immaterialism,11 he spiritualized Holbach's material- istic necessitarianism and thereby formulated a dualistic and quasi-scientific notion of God as the intelligent spirit of the cosmos. This spirit resembles and yet deviates from the 10 Pope and the Context of Controversy: The Manipulation of Ideas in An Es- say on Man (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 42, 55. 11 See C. E. Pulos, The Deep Truth: A Study of Shelley's Scepticism (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1954), pp. 42-66.</page><page sequence="5">466 Dennis M. Welch essayist's concept. Like his deity, it is causal. But instead of being the transcendent " 'first . . . Cause' " (1.145), Shelley's God is the causality (or power) of scientific intelligence sus- taining all reality. In a letter to Elizabeth Hitchener on June 11, 1811, when his ideas for Queen Mab were begin- ning to form, the young poet distinguished between his no- tion of deity as this "existing power of existence" and the concept wherein God "analogises with the universe, as the soul of man to his body" (1.100-01). Whereas Pope's God seemed to be an implausible union of immanence and tran- scendence, Shelley's was a union of nature and spirit. This concept was much easier for him to accept intellectually than the idea of an ultimately transcendent creator. As he wrote in The Necessity of Atheism (1811) and in note 13 of Mab, "it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it" (p. 813). In spite of great differences between Pope and Holbach, it was not unusual for Shelley to borrow ideas from both of them. Indeed, like Holbach, Pope was a necessitarian.12 However, because his God remains transcendent and only "analogizes" with the cosmos and because his providence is therefore only general in its operations, his relationship with the world is indefinable and his necessity is neither comprehensive nor sufficient. Furthermore, because he re- lates to the world as man's soul to the body, he has anthro- pomorphic qualities that make his providence appear neither impartial nor blameless (despite the essayist's argu- ments to the contrary). Detecting these problems in Pope's dualism and his necessitarianism, Shelley formulated a con- cept of Necessity that in scientific and philosophic terms is more comprehensive, sufficient, impartial, and accountable than his predecessor's God. Encompassing all wisdom and law from the scientific and rational to the moral and erotic levels of being, Shelley's necessitarianism imbues all things 12 See White, Pope and the Context, pp. 41-73.</page><page sequence="6">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 467 sufficiently and objectively and is in part responsible for both "the evil and the cure" of this world (III.81). According to Pope's necessitarianism, however, "Heav'n's great view is . . . the Whole" (11.238). And despite consider- able evil within the whole, God's providence is "One com- mon blessing, as one common soul" (IV.62). In other words, God oversees the movement of the whole though not every individual movement of every part. In contrast to this gen- eral yet limited providence, "all-prevailing wisdom" in Queen Mab (11.93) governs each and every phenomenon, in- cluding the molecular and atomic: . . their affections and antipathies, Like his [man's], produce the laws Ruling their moral state; And the minutest throb That through their frame diffuses The slightest, faintest motion, Is fixed and indispensable As the majestic laws That rule yon rolling orbs.' (11.235-43) The comprehensiveness of Shelley's necessitarianism, in- dicated in these verses, suggests also its sufficiency. Accord- ing to the Essay, a chain of love unites the cosmos as a whole and depends entirely on God's transcendent and cre- ative power (III.7-8). But according to Mab, a chain of af- fections and antipathies, attractions and repulsions, causes and effects, holds all things together, independent of any outside power or intelligence: How wonderful! that even . . . the weak touch That moves the finest nerve, And in one human brain Causes the faintest thought, becomes a link In the great chain of Nature. (11.102, 104-08) For Shelley this chain of necessitarian relationships is infi- nite and by itself sustains the cosmos for all eternity. Because Pope believed that nature and man depend on God, he tried to portray him as impartial and blameless in</page><page sequence="7">468 Dennis M. Welch his providence. God looks upon creation with an "equal eye" (1.87), and acts " 'not by partial, but by gen'ral laws' " (1.146). But this "Almighty Cause" would not have ap- peared to Shelley as impartial as Pope suggested. Indeed, the Essay admits that "Heav'n to Mankind [would be] im- partial . . . / If all are equal in their Happiness" (IV.53-54). Since all people are not equally happy, as the radical poet protested throughout Mab, Pope's God is not therefore im- partial. Nor is he blameless. Despite the claim that "God sends not ill" (IV.113), he knows and, hence, must be re- sponsible in some way for the overall scheme in which natu- ral and moral evil abide: Who knows but he, whose hand the light'ning forms, Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms, Pours fierce Ambition in a Caesar's mind, Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind? (1.157-60) Although the essayist tried to free the Almighty Cause from charges of partiality and blame, Shelley considered the effort futile. In place of Pope's God or any similar deity, he substituted the inescapable laws of immanent Necessity (VI.163). The fair oak and the poison tree, the upright man and the slave - all are equal before Necessity's " 'impartial eye' " (VI.203-11, 216). Objective and " 'Unchangeable'," it " 'Requir'st no prayers or praises' " (VI.200, 226) - certainly nothing like "The Universal Prayer," which Pope placed at the end of his Essay in 1738. Implacable Necessity cannot be implored on behalf of good and against evil because it is responsible for both, its degree of responsibility depending on whether they are natural or human in origin. While there may be some reason for despair in this vision, Shel- ley's observations of history and evolution persuaded him that Necessity's design is progressive and beneficent. As Mab proclaimed confidently: ' . . . earth in itself Contains at once the evil and the cure; And all-sufficing Nature can chastise Those who transgress her law . . . (III.80-83; cf. VI.32)</page><page sequence="8">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 469 Earth's capacity to "cure" itself is, indeed, positive in terms of evolution. Its capacity to "chastise" its transgressors is positive also in terms of history, but only if the transgres- sors (we humans) heed nature's principles. (Regarding the question of evil and human responsibility, more will be said in part II of this essay.) Probably the main reason why Shelley substituted Neces- sity's objectivity and accountability for the supposed im- partiality and blamelessness of Pope's God was the latter's anthropomorphism. The Almighty Cause is said to be not only personal (III.71; IV.75), but also just (1.122; IV.69) and good ("Universal Prayer," 7, 22, 36). However, as Shelley wrote in his Letter to Lord Ellenborough (1812), "Moral qualities are such as only a human being can possess. To attribute them to the Spirit of the Universe ... is to de- grade God into a man . . . ,"18 Qualities like justice and goodness are often inconsistent with each other and with impartiality. Surely, a God with these qualities could not accept the death of a hero as readily as the fall of a spar- row. For the Almighty Cause to do so (1.88), or to give only "enough [to the general order of things], while he has more to give" (IV. 164) would have suggested willfulness - another human quality inconsistent with divinity as Shelley under- stood it. This quality implies also changeableness. But since the essayist's God chooses not to change or improve the or- der of things, he cannot be held blameless for it. Unlike Ne- cessity, which possesses neither " 'caprice' " nor " 'human sense' " (VI.200, 218), Pope's anthropomorphic God ap- peared arbitrary, culpable, and perhaps even cruel and authoritarian. Although he is not depicted in these terms, he is referred to as the "lord" (111.42; "Universal Prayer," 23), king (1.256; III. 148), high priest of creation ("Universal Prayer," 49-50), and author of all patriarchy and rule (III.215-17). But, ac- 13 Shelley's Prose, or the Trumpet of a Prophecy , ed. David Lee Clark (Albu- querque: Univ. of New Mexico Press, 1954), p. 77.</page><page sequence="9">470 Dennis M. Welch cording to note 12 in Queen Mab (p. 812), "[b]y the vulgar mistake of a metaphor [that of kingship] . . . [divinity] be- came a man, endowed with human qualities and governing ... as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom" (i.e., arbi- trarily). Thus, even though Pope rejected "Gods partial, changeful, passionate, [and] unjust" (III.257), Shelley must have considered the Almighty Cause a " 'God of human er- ror' " and " 'prototype of human misrule'," whose "attrib- utes and passions [do] change" (VI.199, 105; VII.29). The Essay's allusion to the "Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit" (1.8) would not have escaped Shelley's notice as a ref- erence to the scheme by which that " 'vengeful, pitiless, and almighty fiend' " (IV.211) tempted man in order to ensnare and punish him (VII.109-12; cf. p. 812). A God capable of this malice was unworthy of belief, ac- cording to Shelley. The following words from note 12 con- stitute perhaps his most direct protest against attempts like Pope's to vindicate such a deity: "None but the few . . . who . . . engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their God with the misery of man, will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause, a voluntary action without a motive" (p. 810). With this statement the young poet asserted that the relationship between cause and effect, implicit in an expression like "the Almighty Cause," can never justify such a God and his mis- erable creation, but must impugn him (especially in his an- thropomorphism) as willful and vindictive. In contrast Ne- cessity, the universal and dispassionate spirit, provided Shelley with a quasi-scientific principle that seemed endur- ing, predictable, and reliable. II Besides its dependence on God, creation - the great chain of being as described in the Essay - involves the attributes of mystery and hierarchy, which Shelley revised also from his scientific perspective. While Pope's "vast chain" is ob-</page><page sequence="10">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 471 servable, it can be understood only partially and is there- fore a mystery since it lies mostly beyond human compre- hension. In contrast, Shelley's necessitarian chain can be examined and understood continually anew. Furthermore, while the essayist deemed human "observation . . . the source of the difficulty men have in reconciling God's vari- ous attributes" with the chain of being,14 Shelley considered observation the primary means of understanding the order of things: "The idea of necessity is obtained by our experi- ence of the connection between objects, the uniformity of the operations in nature, the constant conjunction of simi- lar events, and the consequent inference of one from the other" (p. 809). Pope's sense of mystery in nature derives from his hierar- chical vision, in which man with his flaws and limited ca- pacities for knowledge and action (III.110) occupies a "mid- dle state" (II.3) between the animals and God: A being darkly wise, and rudely great: He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest, In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast; In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer, Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err. . . .&lt;11.4, 7-10) With this view of man Pope scorned aspiration as foolish pride (11.19-30). Man's true "bliss" lies in resigna- tion - never "to act or think beyond mankind" (1.189-90). Like the essayist, Shelley considered man a duality of body and soul, passions and mind. As such, he is capable of greatness and " 'imbecility' " (III.16-17). But whereas Pope explored the "science of Human Nature" in its fallenness ("The Design," p. 7), the young poet explored the "science" of "human mind" in its potentiality (p. 810). Thus, he ar- gued that man can overcome his imbecility by means of his soul or mind when it "aspires to Heaven ... for its sempi- ternal heritage" (1.148-49). The young radical considered 14 White, Pope and the Context, p. 168.</page><page sequence="11">472 Dennis M. Welch man's present situation largely the result of unnatural or evil conditions instead of an inherited flaw (IV. 117-19). In place of his predecessor's more-or-less orthodox vision, he substituted radical sociological theory, based on the obser- vation that man is accursed not by sin but by institutions of his own making.18 Fortunately, man is naturally good (IV.120; V.148-50) and can change his institutions. Whereas Pope rejected the idea of perfectibility (I, "Argument"), his young poetic descendent prophesied it confidently: " 'every heart contains perfection's germ' " (V.147). " 'Man is . . . formed for deeds / Of high resolve, on fancy's boldest wing / To soar unwearied' " (IV.154-56). Shelley scrutinized and reformulated not only Pope's general conception of man but also its particulars: reason, self-love and the passions, virtue, evil, and free will. Adher- ing to Godwinian rationalism despite the growing influence of Hume and Drummond on his thought,16 he argued that reason plays the major role in man's attainment of virtue and happiness. Hence, while the essayist subordinated man's reason to self-love and the passions, Shelley did pre- cisely the opposite. Furthermore, while Pope tried to link self-love and the passions to virtue, Shelley believed that it is reason which fosters virtue by its capacity to know Ne- cessity's laws and thereby serve as man's conscience. In its superior and rightful place with respect to the passions and self-love, reason enables man to live by "virtuous daring" rather than submission. Finally, while Pope linked natural and moral evils and thereby diminished human freedom and responsibility, Shelley distinguished between these evils and tried to include freedom and responsibility in his . 18 See P. M. S. Dawson, The Unacknowledged Legislator: Shelley and Politics (Oxford: Clarendon, 1980), pp. 82-83. 16 This statement is not to deny that Shelley's views were in many ways more radical than Godwin's or that he failed to recognize in Godwinian rationalism an element of self-interest, which he rejected.

Press, 1982), pp. 45-59; and Dawson, pp. 249-50.</page><page sequence="12">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 473 scheme despite its necessitarianism. Although reason, according to the essayist, is supposed to "restrain" self-love (11.54), it is actually subordinate to it (II, "Argument"). Moreover, reason provides man very little knowledge (1.148-64; IV.261). Not only does the chain of be- ing lie mostly beyond his comprehension, but so do the aims and purposes of his own actions (1.65-66). How is it, then, that "Nature's road must ever be prefer'd" when "Reason is here no guide" (11.161.62)? Shelley undoubtedly asked himself this question when he read the Essay. Unlike Pope he argued that reason is "the essence of man's being" and "happiness" ( Letters , 1.50) because it helps him to know and articulate the laws of nature and morality. " 'Reason's voice' " is " 'Loud as the voice of Nature' " (III.126-27). " 'Establishing the imperishable throne / Of truth, and stubborn virtue,' " it is the real source of man's governance (VII.246-47). Just as reason is subordinate to self-love, according to Pope, so it is to the passions, which are "Modes of Self- love" (11.93; see 42). In relation to man's "ruling Passion," which gives direction to his life but is also his "peccant part" (11.138, 144), reason is only a "weak queen" (11.150), "more . . . friend than foe" and a "helpless friend" at that (11.164, 154). As a friend to his ruling passion, reason func- tions not to correct it but to give it "edge and pow'r" (11.147), and thereby rationalize it as a virtue rather than perhaps a vice (11.156, 169-74). Shelley specifically revised Pope's subordination of reason to the status of a "weak queen" relative to the passions by correcting their relation- ship in Mab ; in Canto IX passion returns to its proper place " 'like the bee [or servant] ... to her queen,' " reason (IX.53). Because of their dominance in man, Pope tried to link self-love and the passions to virtue in two ways. One way was to argue that, according to God's design, the enlight- ened exercise of these basic drives mediates between per- sonal desires and virtuous action and thus enhances both.</page><page sequence="13">474 Dennis M. Welch Unfortunately, as the essayist admitted, self-love is "greedy" (11.89); and the passions are "selfish" (11.97). Shel- ley doubtlessly agreed with these admissions, for he be- lieved that self-love is little more than selfishness, the bane of humanity, and is distinct from virtue: " 'sincerest virtue needs / No mediative signs of selfishness' " (V.231-32). In addition, self-love has nothing to do with happiness: " 'How vainly seek / The selfish for that happiness denied / To aught but virtue!' " (V.238-40). The second way that Pope tried to link self-love and the passions to virtue was by grafting on to the ruling passion a "best principle" so that virtue "grows . . . with his nature mix'd" (11.176, 178). Unfortunately, this maneuver makes virtue and vice nearly indistinguishable (11.195-96, 209-10). The essayist did endeavor to distinguish these on the basis of conscience - "The God within the mind" (11.204). Ac- cording to Shelley, however, it is not a God within the mind but instead man in his rational comprehension of nature that constitutes conscience. Reason and conscience foster virtue and clearly distinguish it from vice. As Mab pro- claims, vice-ridden authority will lose its sway . . when Reason's voice, . . . shall have waked The nations; and mankind perceive that vice Is discord, war, and misery; that virtue Is peace, and happiness and harmony . . . (III. 126-30) Unlike Pope, Shelley believed that the mind is inherently virtuous and benevolent (V.148-50). Although his belief is no more persuasive than the essayist's view that self-love is social, he considered it more persuasive and therefore spoke of "virtuous daring" ("Dedication," 6) rather than submis- sion as man's ethical course. Finding Pope's message demeaning to man and too much on the side of self-love instead of reason, Shelley responded in Godwinian fashion by asserting in note 15 that "Obedience ... is only the . . . cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can do some- thing better than reason" (p. 822). More courageous and en-</page><page sequence="14">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 475 nobling than resignation, man's "virtuous daring" (see VII.95) is not for his own pleasure (as self-love and reason are in Pope's scheme - 11.87-92), but for the happiness of others (11.64). 17 Such daring helps fulfill Necessity's rational and benevolent order. Just as the essayist linked virtue and vice, self-love and social, so did he link natural and moral evils. Both kinds of evil originate from God's necessary order and the fact that nothing outside God can be perfect (1.145-50). This position unfortunately rationalizes knavery by placing it on the same footing as a natural flaw or disaster: "If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design, / Why then a Bor- gia, or a Catiline?" (1.155-56). The position also diminishes human responsibility and freedom. Indeed, Pope ap- proached determinism in his concepts of both necessity and the ruling passion (11.131-32). 18 And even though he af- firmed free will in "The Universal Prayer" (12), his affirma- tion seems little more than an afterthought.19 At odds with his satiric vision, the concept of evil in the Essay under- 17 As Shelley wrote in A Treatise on Morals, "[t]he benevolent propensities are . . . inherent in the human mind" (Clark, p. 189). The association of pleasure, self-love, and reason in Pope's scheme does not, of course, imply hedonism. The young poet's scheme involves utility and pleasure also. But according to Dawson, he was careful to distinguish these from self-interest by basing them on benevo- lence (pp. 225-30). And in the letters he wrote during the year and a half before Queen Mab, he came to the temporary conclusion that "for the man who is 'king over himself,' a rational act can be the basis of a thoroughly benevolent passion" (John Freeman, "Shelley's Early Letters," in Shelley Revalued : Essays from the Gregynog Conference, ed. Kelvin Everest [Totowa, N.J.: Barnes, 1983], p. 128). 18 See A. R. Humphreys, "Pope, God and Man," in Alexander Pope, ed. Peter Dixon (Athens: Ohio Univ. Press, 1972), p. 89. 19 As a matter of fact, he added "The Universal Prayer," which was written many years before the Essay, to that poem after including a reference to free will in the prayer. (See R. W. Rogers, "Alexander Pope's Universal Prayer, " JEGP, 54 [1955], 612-24.) Shelley would not have known this fact, but the explicit mention of free will in the prayer does give the impression of an afterthought. Moreover, if he read the Warburton edition of Pope's works, he would have gotten this impres- sion since Warburton implied that Pope composed "The Universal Prayer" after the Essay had been "unjustly suspected of a tendency towards Fate and Natural- ism " (II. 103).</page><page sequence="15">476 Dennis M. Welch mines humanity's responsibility to reform: "Teach us to mourn our Nature, not to mend" (11.153). In contrast to the essayist, Shelley distinguished natural from moral evil, protesting against the latter throughout much of his poem. While natural evil originates from Ne- cessity's order, which is ultimately benevolent, moral evil originates from human subjectivity.20 Although such evil is cultivated by malevolent institutions, the young poet con- sidered these also man's responsibility (see V.200-04; VII.91-96).21 This position obviously conflicts with his ne- cessitarianism. In Mab he wrote that human beings are predestined by Necessity like " 'passive instruments' " (VI.215), and yet they possess " 'all-subduing will' " (V.133; see 226). In note 12 he appeared to negate responsibility and free will without exception, and yet in note 15 he de- clared that a "human being can only be supposed accounta- ble for those actions which are influenced by his will" (p. 822). Shelley's effort to resolve the conflict between responsi- bility, free will, and Necessity is not entirely satisfactory, but he undoubtedly considered it more satisfactory than Pope's attempt. As George Santayana says, the young poet "did not subordinate morally the individual to the cosmos. He did not surrender the authority of moral ideals in the face of . . . necessity."22 His spiritualization of Necessity and his faith in the eventual " 'omnipotence' " of man's mind (VIII.236) imply a relationship between nature and 20 See Melvin M. Rader, "Shelley's Theory of Evil," in Shelley : A Collection of Critical Essays , ed. George M. Ridenour (Englewood Cliffs, N.

Shelley tends to place the blame [for evil] rather simply on kings and priests" as representatives of unnatural and oppressive institutions (p. 98). Granted, he accused kings and priests of much ill in society. But he did not seriously believe that overall respon- sibility for moral evil rests in any hands other than those of humanity at large. 22 Essays in Literary Criticism of George Santayana , ed.

The more he knows about Necessity's laws, the more independent he is of convention and falsehood and the freer he is to conform to, and improve his life through, those laws. In Reason and History, Hegel said that the "ra- tional ... is necessary. We are free when we recognize it as law and follow it as the substance of our being."24 In Queen Mab, Shelley understood freedom in such terms. Further- more, he understood that compliance with Necessity consti- tutes not only man's freedom but also his virtue. This com- pliance, decided on the basis of reason and observation, seemed to be a greater freedom than the choice of more-or- less blind resignation urged in the Essay. Thus, Ianthe, with the observations and knowledge afforded her by Mab, is " 'Free from heart-withering custom's cold control' " (IX.201). And the virtuous man is " 'More free and fearless than the trembling judge' " who decides his cases in accord with habit or convention (III.155). The radical poet's concept of freedom as the knowledge and observance of Necessity's laws allowed him both to chastise those who because of their social and educational levels ought to know better than they do, and to forgive those who for the same reasons have been kept from knowl- edge and truth. His idea of freedom also translated into a rationale for dissent and reform against institutions and au- thorities that deceive and oppress people. As Godwin ad- vised in Political Justice, man "must study the laws of na- ture, and the necessary consequences of actions, not the arbitrary caprice of his superiors."28 Taking up Godwin's advice, Shelley argued in Mab that nature supports free- 23 See Letters, I, 152 (October 19, 1811). 24 Reason in History, trans.

This is why Mab scorns the " 'submissive abjectness' " that " 'destroyed / Nature's [Ne- cessity's] suggestions' " to overcome, for example, the tyr- anny of Nero (III.191-92): " 'obedience, / Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth, / Makes slaves of men' " (III. 177-79). Instead of obedience, knowledge and virtuous daring will help reform society and bring about the millennium that sections VIII and IX of Mab portray. Ill Pope's chain-of-being ideas influenced his concept of not only human nature but also the social order. For example, the notion of hierarchy suggests an authoritarian order. By reinterpreting the chain of being scientifically and by manipulating the imagery associated with it, Shelley re- jected this order. Since the world is organized scientifically as a chain of causes and effects, this chain raises the ques- tion whether human beings need authority or their own rea- son to understand themselves and get along in the world. Because Pope considered reason essentially weak, he re- solved this question in favor of authority whereas Shelley resolved it in favor of individual intelligence. Thus, while the essayist claimed that those governments are best which are administered well regardless of their type (III.303-04), he seems to have regarded monarchy at least in its origins as a matter of "virtue" and "common inťrest," "by Nature crown'd" (III.210, 211, 217). The young radical criticized such authority, for it has its origins in " 'vice, black loath- some vice' " (III.122) and is against the common interest and nature itself (III.192). Whereas Pope believed that na- ture "checks" the "Tyrant" (III.51), Shelley went a step further, asserting that " 'Nature rejects the monarch' " (III.170). But since nature alone cannot free humankind from this authority, then " 'Let the axe [of rational think- ing individuals] / Strike at the root, and the poison-tree will fall' " (IV.82-83).</page><page sequence="18">Scientific Prophecy Versus Theodicy 479 In addition to political authority, the necessary hierarchy in God's great chain tends to reinforce economic inequity. Although "God intends Happiness to be equal," material goods are distributed unequally because this is "necessary for Order" (IV, "Argument"). Material equality would breed discontent and disorder. Shelley argued just the op- posite, however, responding not from the a priori notions of theodicy but from the facts of social observation. It is mate- rial inequality that breeds discontent and potential disor- der. Moreover, it is exacerbated by self-love, which fosters destructive greed and extravagance: "The weight [of wealth or its desire] that drags to earth his [man's] towering hopes, Blighting all prospect but of selfish gain, ... it [that weight or desire] destroys, - Leaves nothing but the sordid lust of self . . . ." (V.83-84, 89- 90) Recognizing the effects of inequality, selfishness, and ex- cessive wealth in society, Shelley manipulated the chain-of- being imagery to show that the poor and the rich are con- fined by a mythology of hierarchy and order, which must be abandoned. The poor bear the chains of dearth while the rich bear the chains of excess: "... Poverty and Wealth with equal hand Scatter their withering curses, and unfold The doors of premature and violent death, To pining famine and full-fed disease, To all that shares the lot of human life, Which poisoned, body and soul, scarce drags the chain, That lengthens as it goes and clanks behind.' (V.46-52) Elsewhere, Mab reiterates that the weight which drags man's hopes to earth binds both the rich, who wear a " 'gilded chain' " (111.30), and the world at large: " 'mean lust / Has bound its chains . . . around the earth, / That all within it . . . / Is venal' " (V. 167-69). Since humanity is con- fined also by cultural and institutional expressions of order and hierarchy - expressions such as "customs" and "laws,"</page><page sequence="19">480 Dennis M. Welch these, too, are associated with chains (IV.127-35; cf. 1.126- 27). The most important response in Mab to the socio-politi- cal vision implied in the Essay is a radical egalitarianism, emphasizing the commonality of all creatures instead of a hierarchy. Whereas Pope spoke of "Man's prerogative to rule" (III.160), Shelley declared that " 'Man has lost / His terrible prerogative, and stands / An equal amidst equals' " (VIII.225-26). Impartial Necessity supports the notion of unity and commonality among creatures, for all are equal in its sight. But in further contrast to his predecessor, Shelley added a human dimension to this unity and commonality in order to establish an equal footing among all creatures and also to uplift them. As Mab says to Ianthe, 'There's not one atom of yon earth But once was living man; I tell thee that those viewless beings, Whose mansion is the smallest particle Of the impassive atmosphere, Think, feel and live like man . . . (11.211-12; 231-34) IV In note 7 of Mab, Shelley asserted that egalitarianism in human life can and should be realized over time: "That state of human society which approaches nearer to an equal partition of its benefits and evils should ... be preferred" (p. 805; italics mine). According to his prophetic vision, his- tory (like nature) is evolutionary and progressive.26 Life presses " 'forward where no term can be' " (VI.236), and the soul of man is " 'ever-changing, ever-rising still' " (1.150). As these words suggest, the young poet must certainly have appreciated Pope's references to "progressive life" (1.235) and the "rising Whole" (IV.337) and to dialectic ("Th' 26 See William Royce Campbell, "Shelley's Philosophy of History: A Reconsid- eration," Keats-Shelley Journal, 21-22 (1972-73), 43-63.

Indeed, the ref- erences to dying vegetation cultivating life (III.15-16), to "Wild Nature's vigor working at the root" (11.184), and to its "genial seeds" (III. 118) seem to have been appropriated by him and embellished with his concept of new life emerg- ing through nature's dialectic (V.9-14).27 This dialectic dif- fers from the essayist's, however, for it combines both na- ture and history, the work of Necessity and of man. Whereas happiness in Pope's theodicy is ultimately the "Plant of celestial seed" (IV.7), in Shelley's prophecy it is the fruit of natural process and human eifort. His prophecy is scientific in that it is based on evolution, observation, and probabilistic faith in man and nature working together toward a millennial future: " 'man, with . . . Nature coalescing, / Will undertake regeneration's work' " (VI.42-43). Granted, the record of human history has been discouraging at times; but if humanity did not struggle and " 'Learn to make others happy,' " the " 'will / Of . . . Nature would be unfulfilled' " (11.62-64). There is reason for hope - reason based on historical influences like classical Athens and on causes like the mind of man. By observing such influences and causes, Ianthe learns that the past has largely been man's " 'childhood' " (III. 132) and that his " 'maturer nature' " (III.131) will bring about an " 'age of endless peace' " (111,235). As a result of what she observes in the dialectic of nature and history, she grows convinced of the probability of regeneration and thereby determined to " 'wage [war] / With tyranny and false- hood' " (IX. 190-91). In her efforts she shall not be alone: " 'Some eminent in virtue shall start up' " (VI.33), and ex- pose evil for what it is. When Shelley claimed that tyranny, falsehood, and selfishness will perish by their own corrup- tion (V.16-19), he did not exclude humanity from an active role in this process, for the " 'eminent in virtue . . . / Shall 27 For a discussion of this concept in Mab, see Neville Rogers, Shelley at Work : A Critical Inquiry, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967), p. 33.</page><page sequence="21">482 Dennis M. Welch bind the scorpion falsehood . . . / Until the monster sting itself to death' " (VI.33, 36, 38). Seeking to reconcile natural and moral evils with the ulti- mately benevolent scheme of things, Shelley's scientific vi- sion constitutes an attempt at secular resolution in contrast to Pope's religious acceptance. Natural evil is the responsi- bility of Necessity, which controls it by means of law and wisdom. Moral evil is the responsibility of man, who can and must also control it. Not mere " 'passive things' " (III.233), human beings are dynamic agents with " 'perfec- tion's germ' " (V.147) - the capacity to know, change, and improve themselves and society. With this capacity they can envision a better world, a " 'happy Earth,' " the " 'end of all desire and will, / The product of all action' " (IX.11, 17-18). Pope acknowledged humanity's concern with the fu- ture (1.97-98), yet he negated the capacity to know or pro- ject it: "Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n, / That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n" (1.85-86). His condescending reference to "the poor Indian, whose un- tutor'd mind" projects "Some safer world," "Some happier island" (1.99, 105-06) would have seemed unimaginative to Shelley, for such a realm is what Queen Mab projects - a realm in harmony with nature's laws. Through the observa- tion of causes and effects, Mab can imagine a millennial fu- ture. Through an accumulation of insights based on nature and history, the mind can participate in the regeneration of things. This certainly is the task set for minds like Ianthe's. As a budding skeptic during his Queen Mab phase, Shelley was not completely convinced of the certainty of cause-and- effect relationships and evolutionary progress, but inference and historical evidence gave him faith in the probability of these things; and that for him was far better than the reli- gious belief and acquiescence advocated by his predecessor.
