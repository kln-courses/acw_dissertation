In 1974 the British Colum- bia Provincial Museum again conducted archaeological excavations in the Hesquiat Harbour region of Van- couver Island's west coast. In cooperation with the Cultural Committee of the Hesquiat band, the con- trolled sampling of deposits at DiSo 9, a large burial and habitation cave at the head of Hesquiat Harbour, was continued. In conjunction with the ongoing linguistic and archaeological programs, a summer school program aimed at teaching Hesquiat culture history to the younger band members was conducted by Hesquiat elders. Three band members are currently engaged in a training program at the B.C. Provincial Museum designed to augment earlier training received in the field. A publication series is planned by the Hesquiat Cultural Committee encompassing all aspects of the research to date. Fieldwork planned for the 1975 summer field season includes contour mapping and excavations at DiSo8, a main winter village site at the head of Hesquiat Harbour and DiSo21, a summer village site on the east side of Hesquiat Harbour; contour mapping of a historic fishing station site (DiSo25) and mapping the location of an ocher source; a study of the plant ecology of the region; and collecting adequate "off site" soil samples from areas around the harbor for the purpose of studying local pedogenesis. Linguistic and ethnographic work will also continue throughout the year. A survey crew under the joint supervision of the archaeology division and the Archaeological Sites Advisory Board worked in northeastern British Colum- bia in 1974. Areas surveyed involved relocation areas of the Alaska Highway between mile 82 and mile 278, proposed gas pipeline routes, and the route of a new section of highway to be constructed from mile 317 to the British Columbia-Northwest Territory border. Two new sites were recorded, existing sites were revisited, and information collected from informants on other possible sites outside the survey area. The museum was also involved with the Songhees Indian band in excavations at DcRu12, a large village site. The objectives of the project were to help the Songhees band recover data on their cultural history and train members of the band in archaeological field and laboratory techniques. Excavation involved the first direct-from-field use of the National Inventory procedures for computer processing. Excavation was limited to an area of the site believed to be a large house platform. Analysis of the material remains has not begun, but a brief preliminary consideration of the artifact inventory suggests that the excavated part of the site is similar in time depth and cultural configura- tion to sites previously designated Late Marpole. In 1974, field research into the prehistory of the Queen Charlotte Islands was continued on north- eastern Graham Island under the direction of Patricia Severs (University of Alberta). Intensive excavations were carried out at two localities of Tow Hill (GaTw5), a site utilized throughout the occupational 477</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY history of the islands. Midden deposits examined were of late prehistoric age, radiocarbon dated at 2050?115 years: 100 B.C. (GaK 5440) and 3280?210 years: 1330 B.C. (GaK 5439), and appear to represent the remains of activity-specific areas where locally available resources were exploited. Research at Tow Hill represented part of a three year study on Graham Island to investigate the nature of cultural continuity and change in the middle to late prehistoric periods. The work was carried out in association with that of researchers interested in problems of historic resource utilization and of the paleoecology of the area. Further archaeological investigation on the islands is conditional upon the signing of a research contract with the local Indian band. WASHINGTON. University of Idaho salvage ex- cavations at Kettle Falls, under principal investigator D. G. Rice (University of Idaho) and field director D. H. Chance (University of Idaho), filled gaps in the sequence and enlarged known assemblages in 1974. Work was supported by the Bureau of Reclamation. The sequence of three major discontinuous cultural traditions still holds; it appears to begin by at least 9000 years ago. The earliest horizon, with a recovered sample of 393 tools, was expanded by the addition of over 2500 artifacts from the Andreas site (45FE44) on Hayes Island. Most artifacts were made from quartzite blocks. These early materials display stylistic affinities with Windust phase materials of the lower Snake but also include microblades and cores and evidence of fishing for small, non-salmonid species. The use of Hayes Island for better than nine millennia appears to force the inference that light, easily propelled boats have been a part of the inventory in the Northwest for the entire period. Work at 45ST94, the site of the major nineteenth century salmon fishery, seems to show occupation since roughly 2500 years ago, by a people not completely familiar with local lithic (quartzite) re- sources. Thirty-seven burials were removed, from three periods, including the historic, by Thomas Iverson (University of Idaho). A pit house at 45FE46 was partly excavated showing seven occupations; the earliest floor was benched. A total of nine sites was excavated, and 17 deflated sites were surface col- lected. Under the direction of R. C. Dunnell (University of Washington), an archaeological survey sponsored by the National Park Service was undertaken in the lower Snohomish River Valley and adjacent Everett Harbor. The fieldwork was under the direction of John W. Fuller (University of Washington). Also incorporated in the study was the test excavation of an early historic Snohomish winter village directed by John Mattson (University of South Carolina). The purpose of the study was to identify the spatial and environ- mental distribution of different kinds of archaeolog- ical sites within this geologically and environmentally diverse region so that the distribution of archaeolog- ical resources could be incorporated in land-use planning by a variety of federal and local agencies. Several kinds of shell and non-shell middens spanning approximately 2000 years were identified during the course of the work. Early sites occur throughout the area, on the surface in non-alluvial areas and buried in the alluvial areas to a depth of 1 m in the younger parts of the Snohomish delta. Two radiocarbon age determinations were obtained for this kind of material, one for 45SN41 of 2040?120 radiocarbon years: 90 B.C. (RL469) and one for 45SN35 of 1910?120 radiocarbon years: A.D. 40 (RL-428). Small shell middens occur around the peripheries of the delta and one of these, 45SN39, has been dated at 1020?110 radiocarbon years: A.D. 930 (RL-426), considerably later than the more widely distributed early middens. In addition to 45SN17, at least one other site in the area has an early historic component. Two additional projects were carried out in the lower Columbia Valley under the direction of R. C. Dunnell (University of Washington). A survey, directed in the field by Dennis Lewarch (University of Washington) was undertaken immediately below Bon- neville Dam where new construction is anticipated. Fourteen sites, including a number badly damaged by pothunters and earlier construction, were located. Three, 45SA5, 45SA11, and 45SA12, have been recommended for salvage, and it is anticipated that this work will begin under National Park Service auspices in 1975. The second project concerned the salvage of a small site located in an area to be developed as a park along the north shore of Lake Bonneville. This site, 45SA17, or the Home Valley site, was located earlier in the year by a Washington Archaeological Research Center survey and recom- mended for salvage. Since the site was shallow and fairly extensive on the surface, the entire site was plowed and subjected to systematic surface survey. The results of the computer-assisted spatial analysis show the site to be comprised of a number of closely spaced Cascade phase seasonal occupations. This project was supported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, and directed in the field by Dennis Lewarch (University of Washington). New laboratory quarters at Western Washington State College have added much to storage space and laboratory capabilities. Despite moving and establish- ing operations anew, several projects continue. Final work on artifacts and soil analysis from 45WH34 at Ferndale, brings the report by Gar Grabert (Western Washington State College) on this stratified site near completion. This site appears to bring a modicum of order into the local inland chronology. Its earlier component was deposited shortly after local sea level stabilization. An approximate 5000-year cultural continuum is represented here. Grabert's and Gaston's surveys add further materials to a proposed Ferndale I artifact complex which appears geomorphologically to predate the earliest component at 45WH34. Materials consist of flake, core, and cobble implements with deep weathering located on older channel features of the Nooksack River and its older terraces. Jenna Gaston (Western Washington State College) continues analysis and writing on a series of sites along the Strait of Georgia. Her data reflect Locarno Beach and Gulf Islands-like material, with possibly elements of Mitchell's Montague Harbor I also appearing. Of interest here also is the presence of a pit dwelling, similar to that found at Ferndale. While no radio- carbon assay returns have been received, the materials can reasonably be assigned to the regional sequence, 478 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH with a possible earlier component such as Ferndale I also present. As a result of salvage, further work at Birch Bay is planned for the summer of 1975. This area has been crucial to regional interpretation for its geomorphic features related to sea level oscillation and the variety of components represented there. The opportunity for larger sampling should provide materials for broader interpretations of the locality's prehistory. Gerald C. Hedlund (Green River Community College) continued work at the Jokumsen site (45KI5) on the Enumclaw Plateau in the spring and summer of 1974. This large site, approximately ten hectares (25 acres), has thus far produced over 20,000 stone artifacts from excavation and surface collection on plowed fields. In 1974, evidence of an oval pit-house with the approximate dimensions of 8X6 m was found. A charcoal sample from a hearth near the center of the pit-house depression and 70 cm from the surface produced a date of 3450?80 radiocarbon years: 1500 B.C. (UW-317). The great majority of artifacts catalogued were chipped stone, with only a few rough, abraded or ground stone tools, such as edge-ground cobbles and milling stones. In the pit- house depression, however, 125 ground and polished beads were found distributed throughout an area of 3 m square by 80 cm thick. The beads were made from a variety of stone materials, chert, jasper, and serpentine, and averaged approximately 6 mm in diameter by 3 mm in thickness. The area where the beads were found also appeared to be a lithic workshop, since thousands of waste flakes were found there. The Pedersen site (45KI4), one kilometer south of the Jokumsen site, was also tested in 1974, and artifact collections made on it were catalogued and compared to the Jokumsen materials. Artifacts from the Pedersen site appeared to be of a different assemblage from those of the Jokumsen site. The projectile points were of a somewhat different style; and nipple-top mauls and ground and polished nephrite adzes were present, whereas they were not found on the Jokumsen site. More work at both sites is projected for the summer of 1975. RODERICK SPRAGUE NORTHEAST MINNESOTA. Elden Johnson (University of Min- nesota) reports that work began on a second late prehistoric/protohistoric Eastern Dakota village site on Lake Ogechie in the Mille Lacs Lake region. The site (21ML12) appears to be contemporary with the nearby Cooper (21ML9) site, and, like it, has scattered French trade goods in direct association with Sandy Lake and Oneota ceramics. The site has two structure forms: one is a surface floor, trench, and post form; the second, a rectangular, semi-subterranean form, is similar to Initial Middle Missouri structures. Janet Spector continued intensive site survey in the Mille Lacs Lake region, locating and testing five late prehistoric sites, and tested further to determine the Cooper site boundaries. Christy A. H. Caine excavated a site (21CA58), on federal lands, at the outlet of Gull Lake. The site showed scattered occupational debris from Middle Woodland, Malmo phase, through terminal Woodland, Sandy Lake ceramics. The site complements the previously excavated 21CA37, a linear burial mound site with associated occupational materials. Caine is also developing an on-site public interpretation series of displays for use by the Corps of Engineers. Guy Gibbon surveyed a section of the Blue Earth River basin for Blue Earth phase (Oneota) sites and reports a significant concentration of these sites within a short radius of the Humphrey-Vosburg Blue Earth sites excavated by Lloyd A. Wilford in the 1930s and 40s. WISCONSIN. John R. Halsey (State Historical Society of Wisconsin) has been involved in salvage excavations in the Lake LaFarge project area of Vernon County. Under contract with the National Park Service, Halsey conducted excavations in 1973 and 1974 at the Bard Lawrence Rockshelter (47-Ve- 154), a deep (about 3.6 m) well-stratified rockshelter containing at least seven distinct occupation levels from Middle Archaic to Early Late Woodland. Especially well represented is a Durst occupation (Late Archaic). Analysis of faunal remains suggests that in all time periods represented, the rockshelter served as a late summer-winter collecting camp. The Floyd Rose Rockshelter (47-Ve-146) was excavated in 1973 by Philip H. Salkin (SHSW). This rockshelter contained at least 2 m of deposit; the lower levels could not be reached due to ground water percolation. The shelter contained two major occupa- tions-one definitely assignable to the Effigy Mound tradition and the other probably to the Archaic, although no diagnostic artifacts were found. This site has been interpreted as a short-term hunting-collecting camp. A survey of archaeological remains located in proposed recreation areas surrounding the future Lake LaFarge was done in 1974 by David R. Huelsbeck and Robert P. Fay (SHSW) under contract to the St. Paul District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Huelsbeck's report describes some 130 located or relocated archae- ological sites. Joan E. Freeman (SHSW) supervised archaeological surveys of two small Soil Conservation Service water- shed projects in LaFayette and Calumet counties in 1974. Robert J. Salzer (Beloit College) conducted an inventory of the archaeological resources in the right-of-way of a proposed sight-seeing road in the Horicon Wildlife Refuge, under a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Service. Under a National Forest Service grant, Gordon R. Peters directed the second season of site inventory operations in Nicolet National Forest, locating 70 new sites in lacustrine settings. Beloit also received two National Park Service grants for inventory in the Apostle Islands, in western Lake Superior. David Overstreet directed both projects and is currently involved in analysis. One award was made through the Wisconsin State Historical Society to implement inventory of Madeline Island under the provisions of the state Historic Sites Survey Program. Overstreet found evidence of prehistoric and early and late historic occupations by Ojibwa, Ottawa and 479</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Huron groups. A second grant was made for survey of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, through the Midwest Archaeological Center, providing for further fieldwork during the 1975 summer session. The Beloit College archaeological field school, directed by Frederick Lange, investigated the Turtle Creek drainage in southern Wisconsin. Work focused on site survey and on excavation of early European settlements of the valley. ILLINOIS. Joanne Hennings (Beloit College) under an Historic Sites Survey contract with the State of Illinois, conducted survey and testing operations in the lower Pecatonica River. Over 100 previously un- recorded sites were located in this largely unknown area of the state. Hennings also conducted an inven- tory of the Commonwealth Edison transmission cor- ridor from the Illinois-Wisconsin state line south to Wembleton. The Upper Mississippi Valley Archaeological Re- search Foundation and the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater returned for a second season of salvage excavations at the Orendorf site, a thirteenth century Spoon River temple town in Fulton County. Excava- tions directed by Lawrence Conrad (UMVARF) and Thomas E. Emerson were concentrated around the public square and the southwestern and northeastern edges of the central section of the occupation area. Eighty structures and over 1000 non-structural fea- tures were excavated in 1974, bringing the site totals to over 120 structures and 1450 features. Buildings fronting the public square included a four-room structure measuring about 17 m on a side, two well-preserved burned club houses with abundant evidence for male-oriented activities and two super- imposed buildings with sand-covered floors. Bird effigy pipes were the only unusual objects that were concentrated around the public square. Evidence of a fence running for more than 55 m was found along the southwestern edge of the central housing area. Charles J. Bareis (University of Illinois) conducted a field school on Gem International, Inc., property at the western margin of Cahokia approximately 1-1/2 mi west of Monks Mound. Work was concentrated in a Mississippian village area northeast of former Powell Mound 1. Six structures and a number of pits were exposed. Three structures were rectangular in outline, and three structures, of which two were excavated, were circular in form. The two excavated circular structures were superimposed with an inner wall trench unit containing two hearths surrounded by a single post structure. Associated pottery indicates that the circular structures can probably be assigned to the Fairmount phase. Wayne F. Shields (Dickson Mounds State Museum) was involved in five field projects this past season. Harry Holstein continued the Historic Sites Survey program in the Sugar Creek drainage resulting in a total of 138 new sites for the survey universe. Jerry Fairchild and Wayne F. Shields conducted a field school in conjunction with Western Illinois University; the Gillette site, a Middle Woodland village (Schuyler County) was the focus of activity. Fairchild conducted salvage excavation of a second Woodland site in Schuyler County, financed by a grant from the National Park Service. Fairchild also conducted limited salvage excavation at the Havana Middle Woodland site in Mason County. Alan Harn carried out salvage excavation of the northern portion of the Myer/Dickson village site at Dickson Mounds State Museum. Alan Harn and Virginia Ellsworth continued the analyses of the Dickson cemetery materials in cooperation with George Armelagos and staff (Univer- sity of Massachusetts). The Illinois State Museum-Springfield continued its research program in the Sangamon River drainage under the direction of Walter E. Klippel. A survey of the Sangamon River floodplain was supervised by Andrew Christenson. Test excavations were under- taken at ten sites in the Clinton Power Station reservoir in DeWitt County under the supervision of R. Barry Lewis. Two of the ten sites contained un- disturbed cultural deposits; one (ISMDwv47) is a Late Woodland period campsite and the other a 1.5 m stratified, Late Archaic period midden in the valley of a small wooded creek that was surrounded by native prairie. Excavations supervised by Donna Roper were conducted at a multicomponent Late Archaic, Titter- ington complex, cemetery, and Late Woodland camp- site on the bluffs overlooking the central Sangamon River valley. The 1974 Cahokia Archaeological Project (CAP) under the field supervision of Keith Brandt, continued to work on the stockade 400 m east of Monks Mound. The project was jointly sponsored by the Illinois Department of Conservation and the Cahokia Mounds Museum division of the Illinois State Museum with Melvin L. Fowler (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and James P. Anderson (Cahokia Mounds Museum) as project directors. William R. Iseminger (Cahokia Mounds Museum) supervised five two-week sessions of an amateur field school included in the CAP work force. The summer was spent connecting excavated units and testing several suspected bastion locations. Previous work in this area confirmed a series of four superimposed construction episodes and suggested a rather exact spacing between bastions. Bastions were found as predicted except for one instance where bastions for walls 1 and 2 could not be located. Spacing between the round bastions of wall 1 is the least precise and ranges between 20 and 24 m. The second wall had square, closed gorge bastions with a distance of 20 to 20.5 m between them. These bastions were generally built in the same location as the round ones. The bastions of walls 3 and 4 were square with open gorges. They were superimposed and located between those of wall 2. The spacing between these bastion sets varies only a few centimeters from 24 m. Approximately 130 m of stockade has been exposed and will eventually be reconstructed by the Department of Conservation. Frank Rackerby reported that the Southern Illinois University Museum carried out state-sponsored His- toric Site Surveys in the confluence area of the Mississippi-Ohio Rivers, and along the lower Wabash. Historic excavations were conducted by Margaret Brown at Fort de Chartres. Rackerby and Ron Pulcher conducted a series of small project surveys for the Soil Conservation Service and the U.S. Forest Service. Jon Muller (Southern Illinois University at Carbon- 480 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH dale) conducted the fifth SIU field school in the Kincaid site region. Howard D. Winters and Joel I. Klein (New York University) reported that the NYU Field School in Archaeology entered the field phase of a research project dealing with the origins of warfare in the prehistoric Midwest. Excavations were begun at two sites in the Cache Valley. The Cypress Citadel (SIU 24D2-209) is a relatively undisturbed, large, single component, bluff-top village of the Late Woodland Lewis culture. At Bums' Shelter (SIU 24D2-30), Archaic, Middle Woodland (Crab Orchard), Late Woodland (Lewis), Mississippian, and early twentieth century occupations have been exposed. Hobos ap- parently used the shelter as a resting place during the Depression (the site is near a railroad freight line), and left a midden deposit averaging 20 cm in thickness over the entire site. This debris effectively sealed in the prehistoric material. INDIANA. Preliminary fieldwork was undertaken at the Mounds Bluff Site, Mounds State Park in Madison County by B. K. Swartz, Jr. (Ball State University). The field director was David V. Ellis. The site is a small camp of short-term occupation from an as yet undetermined time period, located on a bluff near the White River. An elaborate complex of Middle Woodland earthworks is situated nearby. Material remains recovered consist primarily of lithic debris, a point, and several tool fragments; two subadult burials were excavated. James H. Keller (Indiana University) reported that in 1974, two major excavations were undertaken by the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology. Patrick J. Munson conducted a field school excavation at the Prairie Creek site in southwestern Indiana. Survey prior to excavation had revealed bones of Pleistocene animals and flakes occurring at a depth of 2.75-4 m below the surface in the exposed bank of a recently dredged ditch. Excavation and subsequent radiocarbon dates, however, have determined that the site consists of a Pleistocene fossil stratum, without associated artifacts, dated to 14,010?140 radiocarbon years: 12,060 B.C. (Dicar Radioisotope Laboratory #234), that is disconformably overlain by a stratum containing Late Archaic materials dated as follows: 34 10?+100 radiocarbon years: 1460 B.C. (Dicar #233); 3180?100 radiocarbon years: 1230 B.C. (Dicar #232); and 2880?80 radiocarbon years: 930 B.C. (Dicar #231). A Late Woodland burial site was excavated in lartholomew County with the permission and finan- cial support of the Cummins Engine Company on whose land the site is located. The site consisted of a low sand and gravel knoll in the alluvial plain of the East Fork of the White River, measuring 6.5 m in diameter and about 2 m in height. The number of burials originally present was indeterminable owing to disturbance by long years of plowing and recent "pot hunting." However, 13 individuals were represented in the five burial pits. One of these contained six skulls and disarticulated post-cranial remains; a second had two slightly flexed burials into which partially cremated remains had been intruded. Artifacts in the graves were uncommon. Two ovoid gorgets made from marine shell, copper and shell beads, bone awls, and a Late Woodland pottery vessel were found. In one example it appeared that an aboriginal "tool kit" had been placed with the deceased; the kit contained a beaver incisor, hammerstones, and bone flint chipping tools. In addition to concentrations of intentionally placed flint chippage, the total assemblage had been covered with quantities of red ocher. The Columbus site was completely excavated; one of the more interesting discoveries was the delimita- tion of more than 30 aboriginal pits. These had originally been excavated through the brown clay which capped the knoll, into the underlying sand; the pits had then been refilled almost wholly with the clay. Some of these were as large as 1.5 m in diameter and equally deep. They contained little more than a few pieces of charred wood and occasionally a small scrap of bone. Because the site was clearly not a camp or village it might be assumed that these abundant features were utilized in some fashion for burial preparation. Radiocarbon dates from the site are as follows: 1050?100 radiocarbon years: A.D. 900 (Dicar #235); 600?110 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1350 (Dicar #236). A long term project was initiated in a portion of the drainage system of the West Fork of the White River bounded on the south by the Daviess-Greene County line and Indianapolis to the north. Within a 60 mi distance the valley touches upon five of Indiana's major physiographic zones, and therefore the region has substantial potential for analyzing prehistoric exploitation. More than 1000 sites have already been documented, and James Denbow, Richard Harrison, John Richardson, and Lee Beaven conducted intensive surveys of a restricted area during the past summer. Thomas Green continued an intensive survey of portions of Warrick and Vanderburgh Counties in an effort to define more explicitly the Mississippian settlement pattern in the Wabash lowlands. Van Reidhead undertook a comparable survey and site testing in Dearborn County as a continuation of a study that explores prehistoric utilization of food resources in two periods in the past. Cheryl Munson and Thomas Green have under- taken a reanalysis of materials recovered by Warren K. Moorehead and Clifford Anderson at the "Mouth of the Wabash" site in 1898. It is concluded that this collection represents a burial complex of the Caborn- Wellborn Phase, a recently defined Late Mississippian occupation. Curtis H. Tomak (Indiana University) made test excavations at the Prairie Creek site (12Da9) in the White River valley, Daviess County. The site is stratified and has paleoecological potential. Various strata produce well-preserved wood, shell, and the bones of a variety of mammals, fish, turtle, and birds. During September and October 1973, excavations were conducted at the site to recover a sample of the botanical and faunal remains. These produced chert flakes, bone and antler artifacts, a quantity of wood, and an assemblage of faunal material including the bones of extinct animals from one of the strata. The extinct animals identified so far from this stratum are peccary (Mylohyus) and giant beaver (Castoroides). Artifacts also occurred below this stratum. MICHIGAN. The Michigan State University 481</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Museum and Department of Anthropology were in- volved in a number of 1974 field programs. Charles Cleland and William Lovis directed a National Science Foundation sponsored (GS4 2053) survey of the Inland Waterway in the northern Lower Peninsula. The 20% stratified proportional random sample of the 192 mi2 survey area located 42 sites: 20 Archaic; 20 Woodland, and two of undetermined age. Preliminary synthesis indicates a riverine rather than a lacustrine settlement pattern. Excavations were initiated at Fort Ouiatenon, a mid-eighteenth century French military post and trading establishment located on the Wabash River in Indiana, under a grant from the Tippecanoe County Historic Society to Charles Cleland. Preliminary work, under supervision of Judith Tordoff, revealed numer- ous subsurface trench features not yet interpreted, as well as eighteenth century artifacts. Joseph Chartkoff directed a field school at the Root site, on the Grand River in Eaton County, which investigated the definition of activity areas, site limits, and subsistence patterns, and explored a probable mound. This late Middle Woodland and Wayne Tradi- tion site yielded circular house patterns. The probable mound was determined to be a natural feature with intrusive burials. There is also some evidence of eighteenth and/or nineteenth century historic occupa- tion. William Lovis initiated an inventory and evaluation of the proposed Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lake- shore in Benzie and Leelanau Counties with funds from the National Park Service. Survey of one part of the area, South Manitou Island, revealed minimal prehistoric occupation, in contrast to settlement evidence from the previously surveyed North Manitou Island. It is probable that sites have been buried by shifting dunes, although one Woodland and one Archaic site were located. Lyle Stone (Mackinac Island State Park Com- mission) continued research at eighteenth century Fort Michilimackinac, and at the Filbert site, a nineteenth century mill, trading post, and residence. Lee Minnerly located, and partially excavated, the Fort Michilimackinac powder magazine, a semi- subterranean wood structure with a direct entrance- way. The Filbert site excavations, supervised by Patrick Martin, were exploratory, designed to locate the mill structure; further investigation of the known residence was also carried out. Also excavated was the dam complex, which revealed cribbed log construction with rubble fill. Fel Brunett (Chippewa Nature Center-Midland) reported that, in cooperation with Central Michigan University, parts of three sites were excavated during 1974. An early nineteenth century historic site (20MD 36) along the Chippewa River was tested. A prehis- toric Late Woodland site (20MD 30) on the Pine River also was investigated. Excavations had begun on the site in 1973 as salvage work preparing for the Nature Center's new interpretive building. In addition to Bay Port Chert and Saginaw Valley ceramics, the site has yielded a rolled copper harpoon and a complete miniature vessel. Work was conducted at the Barnes Site (20MD 1), a Paleo-Indian site on what appears to be part of the Lake Warren beach system. The site is located in Jasper Township, Midland County. Several tools, including a graver, scraper, and fluted blade fragments of Bay Port and other chert types were recovered from the plowzone. OHIO. During 1974 Ronald H. Spielbauer (Miami University) continued the survey program begun in 1973. Efforts again concentrated on the Great Miami River drainage area. Sites located through this program date from the Archaic through the Mississippian periods. Test excavations were conducted at Hine Village, a Madisonville Focus, Fort Ancient site, situated on an old channel of the Great Miami River. Evidence of approximately two dozen structures was discovered indicating a series of rebuilding attempts and contemporary units. The site was selected for testing in an attempt to amplify data and interpreta- tions obtained through the salvage excavation of another Fort Ancient site in 1973. Kent D. Vickery (University of Cincinnati) ex- cavated at the Bullskin Creek site (33Ct29), a Late Archaic camp in Clermont County, during 1974. Refuse pits, earth ovens, one roasting pit, one possible storage pit and two sub-midden caches are represented among the 12 excavated features. One cache was a deposit of ceremonial items including an antler atlatl hook, turtle carapace container, hematite rubstone, and the articulated remains of the forearm and talons of a great horned owl. One of three tightly flexed burials occurred below midden; another was intrusive and had a projectile point of probable Early Woodland affiliation embedded. Salvage excavations supervised by Timothy Dalbey were undertaken at the DuPont site (33Hall) from October to March 1974. About 60 features, 23 flexed and semi-flexed burials, and 18 postholes were excavated in a small portion of this large Late Archaic base camp in Hamilton County. About half of the burials had associated grave goods, and at least two show death by trauma. Several had been placed on "platforms" adjoining pits, a few of which have subterranean tunnels leading to adjacent but smaller pits. Mussel shell occurs in relative abundance in an extensive but shallow midden deposit. James Theler and Rodney Riggs excavated a small test pit at the stratified Sand Ridge site (33Ha17) in Hamilton County. Plant and animal remains and ceramic debris were recovered from Late Woodland and Fort Ancient levels in relative abundance. PENNSYLVANIA. In 1974 Ronald L. Michael (Center for Prehistoric and Historic Site Archaeology, California State College, California, Pennsylvania) ex- cavated at Fort Gaddis, a Revolutionary War settlers fort in Fayette County. The excavation of Fort Gaddis has to date encom- passed an area of approximately 1250 ft2. Scattered postholes and small refuse pits have been discovered together with the remains of an H-shaped chimney that once stood at the end of an addition to the original structure. The addition, which Gaddis had built by 1798, was a 1-1/2 story log structure complete with subterranean basement or root cellar. No historical documents indicated that the root cellar existed, and consequently it required a considerable amount of time to excavate this feature which extended approximately 5 ft below the present ground 482 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH level. The walls of the basement were constructed in an interesting fashion. The southernmost wall was of cut sandstone and included the exterior exit from the basement. The eastern and northern walls, however, were apparently composed of sawed boards that had been nailed horizontally to posts set in the ground. In the course of the digging, four of these posts were discovered even though the basement had been filled in when the addition was removed in the early twentieth century. The presence of rat and other rodent mandibles within the basement helps substantiate the claim that this area was once used for the storage of foodstuffs. Artifacts discovered in the basement fill include British half-penny coins (1731 and 1774) and a Spanish Real coin (1782). Vast numbers of nails and horseshoes also indicate that blacksmithing was carried out in the area. Just beyond the point where the addition once stood, a circular depression about 15 ft in diameter and 2 ft deep was discovered. The depression had been filled with a large quantity of sandstone and covered with topsoil. It is currently thought to have been a chinking pit from which the subsoil daubing used between the house logs was obtained. The sandstone within the pit probably was left over from the construction of the stone foundations from the original building or the additions. The excavators have also recovered an estimated 35,000 pieces of bottle and window glass, iron, brass, and copper fragments in addition to whitewares, porcelain, pearlware, delftware, and white salt-glazed stoneware. Large amounts of utilitarian salt-glazed stonewares and redwares have also been found, and, in fact, the latter ceramic category probably constitutes the largest single ceramic sample from the site. It is believed that the redware and stoneware jars were made in the nearby Greensboro/New Geneva area, which supported large numbers of potteries through- out the nineteenth century. The redware may also have been manufactured in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the excavation has not yielded any trace of the stockade which supposedly surrounded the extant structure. It is consequently not possible at this time to either substantiate or refute the notion that Gaddis' home was ever stockaded by the local militia unit. Gustav Konitzky (Clarion State College) continued investigations of site 36-CI-52 (State Road Ripple) in an attempt to determine the temporal extent of the early occupations. Previous work had demonstrated the presence of a Contact period component, tenta- tively dated to 172040 on the basis of trade goods, plus a representation of the various Woodland stages in stratum I. Stratum II contains a Terminal Archaic component near its upper limit and evidence of a Brewerton-like component. The presence of bifurcated poi'nts in stratum III had been noted. The following radiocarbon dates were obtained on charcoal samples collected in 1974: the Terminal Archaic at the site was dated with a sample from a large, stone-lined fire pit in stratum II at 3041?70 radiocarbon years: 1091 B.C. (UGa-875). Hearths below stratum II are small, shal- low basins without stone lining; a sample from stratum III returned a date of 6890?100 radiocarbon years: 4940 B.C. (UGa-877) which is in general agreement with what was previously known about the spread of bifurcated points into western Pennsylvania. A sample from the lowest level of the site that so far has yielded merely sandstone and siltstone chopping tools gave a date of 11,360+140 radiocarbon years: 9410 B.C. (UGa-878). These tools represent roughly shaped choppers of locally available materials; no projectile points have so far been found in association with them. Charles W. McNett, Jr. (American University) excavated the deeply stratified Shawnee Minisink site (36MR43) with the support of the National Geo- graphic Society. The site, containing both Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic occupations, is located at the confluence of the Delaware River and Brodhead Creek. It was concluded that an intensive and exten- sive Early Archaic component completely sealed from the Paleo-Indian is present, and that among the implements used in the Early Archaic is the ground- stone gouge. During the season additional Paleo-Indian material was recovered, extensive geological and paly- nological information was obtained for reconstructing the prehistoric habitat, and additional radiocarbon samples were collected. There are four major stratigraphic zones at the site. Zone 1 contains Late Woodland to Late Archaic components; Zone 2 yielded the Early Archaic material and extends from .6 m to 1.5 m in some squares. Variation in horizontal and vertical distribu- tion of artifacts, including more than ten projectile points, is indicative of differential occupational or functional areas within the site as well as chronological differences. The points suggest Kanawha and LeCroy types from the Early Archaic in West Virginia as well as points of the Palmer and Kirk traditions in the Carolina Piedmont, but differences prevent one from assigning these type names at this site. However, they are undoubtedly in the same horizon, and the dates of approximately 6000 to 7000 B.C. should hold. Zone 3, while culturally sterile, yielded significant geological information. Zone 4 extends from 2.3 m to 2.7 m and consists of alternating 30 cm thick red mottled silty loam layers and thin sand deposits. The Paleo-Indian artifacts occur in the second mottled layer, and nine squares were excavated to the top of this area. A contour map revealed a topography totally different from the present day land surface and indicated a paleo-drainage system in a flood plain interspersed with interfluvs. Soil augering indicates that another 1.2 m of untested deposits exist above glacial gravels dating about 13,000 years old. Bill Engelbrecht (State University College at Buffalo) directed the third season of excavation on the Griswold site with students from Edinboro State College. The Griswold site is an early Late Woodland site near Lake Erie. A number of features were uncovered, together with quantities of cord-marked pottery. VIRGINIA. Research in the Middle Shenandoah valley is continuing under the direction of William M. Gardner (Catholic University). Largely sponsored by the Thunderbird Museum and Archaeological Park, projects include: a study of the distribution and ecological setting of fluted point finds (Robert Ver- rey); excavation of a buried circular stone wall of 483</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY possible Late Archaic provenience (William Boyer); distributional analysis of Early Archaic components (Joseph McNamara); distribution and chronology of Archaic cultures (Deborah Harrison); study of Late Woodland and historic Indian occupations (Glenda Miller); continuing excavation of a Paleo-Indian through Early Archaic multicomponent processing station (Kurt Carr); paleoecology of the Shenandoah valley (Victor Carbone); functional analysis of Paleo- Indian bifaces (James Melton); ceramic analysis (Alexander Ghosh); analysis of intrasite habitation areas (Gene Ham); determination of the socio-cultural affiliations of a series of stone burial mounds (Joan Walker); study of settlement patterns (Dolores Hall); functional analysis of an Early Archaic/Paleo-Indian component (Robert Wall); and a geomorphological and cultural comparison of terrace sites from both sides of the Shenandoah (Dennis Curry). NEW YORK. Bruce Rippeteau (SUNY-Oneonta) and Robert Funk (New York State Museum and Science Service) excavated at several stratified sites near Oneonta in 1974, under the auspices of the Upper Susquehanna Prehistory Project. Overall re- search has concentrated on later Archaic cultures by sampling multicomponent, deeply stratified floodplain sites and by the compilation of a radiocarbon chronology resolving time in some periods to decades. Research grants to both investigators appear to have produced the greatest number of radiocarbon dates for a single valley system in the northeast. Charles F. Hayes III (Rochester Museum and Science Center) reported on the Stone-Tolan site (1789-1839), Brighton, Monroe County. During sum- mer 1974 analysis and identification of materials excavated from 1960 through 1970 were completed. Efforts are now being made to publish a comprehen- sive, in-depth artifact catalog. This catalog would also deal with the historical and architectural aspects of this early nineteenth century domestic site. Research into the lead-glazed earthenware pottery industry of western New York continues. An analysis of materials excavated in 1973 at the Morganville Pottery, Stafford Township, Genesee County (about 1829-1900) is nearly completed, and a manuscript is being prepared as a joint effort of the Canadian Department of the Royal Ontario Museum and the Rochester Museum and Science Center. This report will cover almost every earthenware form uncovered during excavations. Research also continues on the analysis of materials recovered at the "Nathanial Rochester" Pottery (about 1818-1832) West Bloom- field, Ontario County. This site was excavated in 1973 and has produced the earliest lead-glazed earthenware material yet documented in the Rochester area. Particularly significant are the occurrences of slip- decorated wares previously undocumented for western New York. Margaret Weide (SUNY Binghamton) reported that their Northeast research program is focusing on s e ttlement-subsistence networks in the upper Susquehanna River valley. During the 1974 field season, excavations were conducted on Hiawatha Island near Binghamton under the direction of Mar- garet A. Powers and Judith Rasson, and on the route of 1-88, an expressway which will connect Binghamton with the Albany-Schenectady area. Hiawatha Island excavations were confined to testing to evaluate the archaeological resources present on the island, which is privately owned and may be developed as a tourist attraction. Preliminary results indicate that at least four loci of occupation, dating to Late Archaic, Woodland and the nineteenth century periods are present. On the 1-88 Archaeological Project, directed by Margaret L. Weide, final excavations were undertaken at the Sidney Airport site, now removed for borrow. The site included Late Archaic and Late Woodland components. A series of Late Archaic loci were excavated near Otego at the Mattice-Hendricks local- ity, which also included an early eighteenth century farmstead. Survey and testing for sites to evaluate the significance of archaeological resources on proposed expressway segments resulted in the location of about 75 prehistoric and historic sites. MASSACHUSETTS. Investigation of a seventeenth century Squakeag fortified village was continued under the direction of Peter Thomas (University of Massachusetts, Amherst). Part of the palisade wall and large numbers of refuse-filled pits and hearths were exposed, as well as possible house patterns. The village appears to be the one burned during Mohawk raids in 1664. Sumac seeds recovered from low levels in a sealed pit were successfully germinated (77%) in tests run by the West Experiment Station at the university. The numbers of seeds recovered from several pits indicate that the Squakeag drank sumac tea. During June and July a field crew directed by John S. Wilson excavated the Upper Factory Brook Sawmill site in Middlefield, under a National Park Service salvage contract. This site consisted of the foundation and associated hydraulic features of an early nine- teenth century up-and-down type sawmill. Excavated material includes several hand-made wooden machinery components, revealing interesting examples of the rural millwright's craft. CONNECTICUT. Douglas F. Jordan (University of Connecticut) excavated a small site in the Connecticut River floodplain in South Windsor. The major occupa- tion, about 1-1.3 m below the surface, is related to the Late Archaic Squibnocket complex. Evidence from the site strongly suggests that the "Squibnocket complex" consists of two separable components, an earlier tentatively identified as Vibert complex and a later, characterized by Wading River/Squibnocket stemmed points. Using flotation techniques, Jeremy Stephenson and Mark Paulsen (North East Archaeological Re- searchers, Inc.) have recovered a number of charred seeds and other plant material from soil samples primarily from the Eckart site in New Haven County. Similar finds have been made for other sites in adjacent Fairfield County, and the seeds are under- going expert botanical study. Previous investigators have generally ignored botanical potentials in the highly acid soils predominating in lower New England sites. B. W. Powell reports that study is continuing on quartz-quarry phenomena associated with excavations conducted by NEAR at the Eckart site: very exten- sive, and presumed early aboriginal quarrying and mining is being demonstrated at a number of locales 484 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH formerly thought to have originated with later (nine- teenth century) white activity. DELAWARE. Ronald A. Thomas (Delaware State Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs) reports that test excavations directed by Daniel Griffith and Richard Artusy Jr., were conducted at two Late Woodland sites in Sussex County. Both were of the Slaughter Creek phase and contained large amounts of Townsend series ceramics. Among the features ex- cavated were storage pits, graves, and semi-sub- terranean houses. The largest of the houses was sub-rectangular and contained a central fire hearth. Preliminary analysis of the ceramics suggests that further work may lead to a subdivision of the Slaughter Creek phase based on ceramic associations. The first sheets of the Lithic Source Notebook have been issued by the Section of Archaeology and are available at cost. Historical archaeological research is being conducted by the Historic Registrar Section of the Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs under the direction of Edward Heite and Cara L. Wise. ONTARIO. The archaeological investigation of Fort St. Joseph, a palisaded British military installa- tion established in 1796, and burned by Americans in 1814, was resumed during summer 1974 after a ten-year lapse. Previous work at the site on St. Joseph Island had been conducted by a University of Toronto team in 1963-64, for the National Historic Parks and Sites Branch. The 1974 excavations centered on the blockhouse, the powder magazine, an unidentified structure represented by a relatively intact chimney, and the west bastion and northwest curtain wall of the palisade. The work was primarily intended to recover information concerning the size, layout, and construc- tion of these structures in anticipation of site develop- ment. The project was directed by Karlis Karklins, assisted by Ellen Lee (National Historic Parks and Sites Branch, Parks Canada). LABRADOR. In 1974 Robert McGhee and James Tuck (Memorial University of Newfoundland) con- tinued excavations in the Strait of Belle Isle region. The project was financed by the Canada Council. Sites discovered in 1973 were further excavated, and several new sites with an early or middle Archaic range were discovered. Of special interest was the discovery of a large (9 m in diameter) rock-covered burial mound containing an adolescent skeleton. A number of bone and antler artifacts were preserved including several hollowbased bone points, a bird bone whistle, an unmodified walrus tusk, a small pendant, and toggling harpoon and hand-held toggle. The radiocarbon sample from a fire apparently associated with the burial ritual was dated at 7530?110 radiocarbon years: 5580 B.C. (1-8099). Other sites seem to prove continuity of occupation from sometime prior to 6000 B.C. until at least 1000 B.C. NEW BRUNSWICK. Historical Resources Ad- ministration undertook research in a number of major areas. Excavations led by David Burley continued on select nineteenth century house sites for the Acadian Village Project, a reconstructed historic village in the northeastern part of the province. Results of the excavation will support the architectural and furnish- ings programs of the restorations. The same crew also surveyed the lower Petitcodiac River for future aspects of this reconstruction. The pre-1750 Acadian history is not well known and attempts were made to find house sites of this period suitable for excavation. The survey initiated a long-term inventory of the Province for archaeological sites of all periods, starting with major urban areas. Saint John and vicinity were also examined. Excavations sponsored by the Canada Council continued for a second and final season on Fulton Island (BIDn-12) in the St. John River estuary as part of a general research program by Chris Turnbull. This stratified site has scattered traces of occupations from about 2000 years ago to the early historic period, essentially the whole ceramic period. A date of 1820?120 radiocarbon years: A.D. 130 (RL-147) is from the same level as a ceramic pot with rocker dentate stamp decoration and an applique band under the rim. The St. John River survey was extended by work on a major tributary river, the Oromocto. Pat Allen surveyed the river areas recording 12 sites. Two more stratified ceramic sites, similar to Fulton Island, were located, one of which has been extensively tested by amateurs. A possible habitation site associated with the Moorehead Burial tradition has also been located. Two sites were salvaged in the St. John River. Harrison Farm is located near Maugerville on the flood plain. Flooding of the river eroded out a major section of a plowed field leaving site remains with late ceramics exposed. Most of the site was in the plow zone. Whitemarsh Creek was disturbed by stream alteration, a sand pit, and bulldozing. An extensive collection of cores and chipping debris were obtained. The use of a single raw material with river gravel source, suggests a single occupation. A single iron point with a barbed tip, found in direct association with chipping debris, suggests an early historic site of the Maliseet. One project was aborted for the second season when negotiations with the Archaeological Survey of Canada to fund excavations on the Augustine site broke down. This site, a burial of four people, is located on the Red Bank Indian Reserve, Northumber- land County, and is probably related to the Adena burial tradition, judging from the grave goods and the mound in which they were buried. Unfortunately the site is extensively disturbed. One carbon sample from backdirt dates at 2330?110 radiocarbon years: 380 B.C. (RL-344). FRANK RACKERBY PLAINS SASKATCHEWAN. W. J. Byrne (then National Museums of Canada; now Archaeological Survey of Alberta) investigated several sites along the South Saskatchewan River. The first, near White Bear, was tested in an attempt to find the "Mandan earth lodge village" recorded in this area by Peter Fiddler in 1800 during his trip to establish Chesterfield House. Al- though several large pit forms were located and artifacts, bone, and charcoal were recovered, the data were too inconclusive to determine whether or not this was the site reported by Fiddler. 485</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The second site, north of Prelate, was a buried camp with two occupations visible in the bank. The occupations varied from 2.5-5 m below the surface, and at low water the living floors were about 3 m above water. The occupations were sparse but possibly related to the Pelican Lake complex. Bone preserva- tion was poor and no pottery was found. The last site investigated was east of the Alberta border in an area containing buffalo jumps, a buffalo pound, tipi ring and boulder outline localities, and several buried camps. Testing was confined to a buried camp. Numerous occupations-possibly as many as eight-were located in a single 1.5 m deep cut. Projectile points and pottery gave a Late Prehistoric date for the upper strata, but the age and affiliations of the lower occupations are unknown. Surface collection on this and adjacent sites produced point types ranging from Duncan-McKean of the Middle Prehistoric period, to Avonlea and Side Notch of the Late Prehistoric, to metal trade of the Protohistoric. Of particular interest was a complete bison metapodial flesher from the bottom occupation, one of the few such tools excavated on the Canadian plains. J. F. V. Millar (University of Calgary) supervised J. Ives and A. Smith who directed excavations of the Grey site, near Swift Creek. C. E. Eyman (University of Calgary) also worked at the site, where 30 burial units were uncovered in 1973. To date 46 adults, of a total of over 170 inviduals, have been excavated. The site was used by Oxbow-affiliated peoples. George W. Arthur (University of Regina) has undertaken a three year Federal-Provincial contract from the Department of Tourism and Renewable Resources to conduct archaeological investigations in the Qu'Appelle River Basin. Field supervisors are Ivan Sharp and Dianne Wilson. Research at Qu'Appelle is being directed toward the development of archaeolog- ical and historical resources for tourism and recrea- tion. MANITOBA. Walter M. Hlady (Manitoba Archae- ological Society) continued work at the Stendall site (C3-WA-1) 20 mi west of Virden. This bison kill and butchering site dates between A.D. 1000 and 1200. Work continued at the Tipi site on the Manitoba- Ontario boundary, where experiments with a magneto- meter to establish differences in bedrock to locate catch basins have been progressing satisfactorily. Sur- veying the Trans-Canada Highway between Portage la Prairie and Brandon resulted in an additional 20 sites. MONTANA. The University of Montana Statewide Archaeological Survey, directed by Floyd W. Shar- rock, conducted salvage excavations at a bison kill site near Augusta. Shoreline surveys of the Fresno and Clark Canyon reservoirs were completed, and those of Canyon Ferry Reservoir and Flathead Lake were begun under the sponsorship of the National Park Service. An archaeological and historical sites survey of the Rock Creek drainage in western Montana, and a continuing survey of the Ashland District of Custer National Forest was sponsored by the National Forest Service. Kent Good (University of North Dakota Archae- ological Research) excavated the Pretty Creek site (24CB4&amp;5). This extensive test was in the path of the proposed Transpark Highway, Bighorn Canyon Recreation Area. Lawrence Loendorf (University of North Dakota Archaeological Research), assisted by Alan Car- michael, mapped and tested ten archaeological sites also in the path of the Transpark Highway. The most common were tipi rings. NORTH DAKOTA. C. L. Dill (Fort Clark Historic Site) continued test excavations there. Fort Clark was an American Fur Company trading post from 1831 to 1860. Evidence of the builder's trench associated with the stockade and 13 buildings, including two block houses, was uncovered. Test excavations were con- tinued in the adjacent Mandan-Arikara village. The restoration of the trading building at the Gingras Historic site, Walhalla, continued with pre- parations for the dismantling of the house and the excavation of the house cellar and adjacent areas. Fred Schneider (University of North Dakota) directed three projects supported by the National Park Service. Survey and test excavations were continued in the proposed Lonetree Reservoir; tipi rings are the most common archaeological sites. A sampling design included test excavation of 70 tipi rings. A shoreline survey was conducted along Lake Sakakawea, and 51 sites were located. The majority of the artifacts recovered are affiliated with Middle period cultures. One Folsom and one Eden point were also found. Work was continued at the Moe site where a fire hearth and additional strata trenches were excavated. These Folsom materials seem to be eroding out at or below water level. Surveys were conducted in the proposed New Rockford Canal route, and in areas of bank stabilization and proposed irrigation in the James River valley. Linear and conical Woodland burial mounds were the most common sites encountered. Lawrence Loendorf (University of North Dakota Archaeological Research), with Alan Carmichael, con- ducted a shoreline survey at Lake Ashtabula on the Sheyenne River; conical Woodland burial mounds predominated. A survey of the pond area of the Square Butte Watershed Dam #6 north of Bismarck was done, and a historic site with five pioneer burials was located. Kent N. Good as a co-supervisor with Loendorf surveyed 320 mi of the path of the proposed Dowe Pipeline. Four archaeological sites (one Archaic) and a historic homestead were recorded. Kent N. Good (University of North Dakota Archaeological Research), under the direction of Lawrence L. Loendorf, supervised five surveys and one excavation. Three surveys were sponsored by the Soil Conservation Service. An irrigation project near Grandin had no sites. Two surveys of pond areas, the Upper Turtle River (Dam #9) and the South Branch of the Forest River (Dam #4), discovered Woodland burial mounds and scattered lithic areas or occupation sites. A shoreline survey at Homme Dam near Park River located Woodland burial mounds and occupa- tion sites. Finally, a prehistoric burial of an adult female with a complete tool kit encountered during a gravel mining operation was excavated near Lisbon. SOUTH DAKOTA. John Sigstad (South Dakota Archaeological Research Center) completed the archaeological survey of the proposed Blunt Dam and Reservoir and Pierre Canal. Over 200 new sites were [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975] 486</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH recorded. The Center conducted exploratory excava- tions at the Heath site (39LN15), a multicomponent Plains village site on the Big Sioux River. At least one of the components is Mill Creek. This work was supported by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Ruthann Knudson (University of Idaho) is study- ing the Anton Rygh site (39CA4) in Campbell County. Special attention is being paid to the lithic and bone tool industries from this multicomponent site. There is a major Extended Coalescent and a thin Post-Contact Coalescent occupation. Larry Agenbroad (Chadron State College) ex- cavated the remains of three mammoths in a strati- graphic context that indicates a Karst sink in Paleozoic sediments near Hot Springs. There are at least 16 ft of alternating clay and sand strata containing pollen, fresh water invertebrates, and mammoth and carnivore remains. WYOMING. Research under George C. Frison (University of Wyoming) centered around the Medicine Lodge Creek project. The Medicine Lodge Creek site itself is producing an almost continuous record of habitation for the last 10,000 years with only a break in the late altithermal. Smaller sites are now being investigated from the floor of the Big Horn Basin at about 3800 ft to above timberline. Pre- liminary investigations in a mammoth kill have now produced three immature mammoths along with evi- dence of bison, antelope, and jackrabbit. A date of 11,200+220 radiocarbon years: 9250 B.C. (RL 392) was obtained on the mammoth kill. Additionally, a large number of coal-lands surveys were carried out as was a cultural resource survey of the upper Green River area. The latter produced one site that should be of importance in resolving prob- lems of the altithermal occupation of that area. NEBRASKA. Ruthann Knudson (University of Idaho), with National Science Foundation funds, is working on the 8000 year old component of the Red Smoke site (25FT42), in the Medicine Creek area. As part of this project, extensive studies are being carried out on local Republican River chert and Republican River gravels (neutron activation analysis, petrographic description, materials testing). Experimental tool use studies have also been initiated, and casts are being made of representative tools and manufacturing by-products. Larry D. Agenbroad (Chadron State College), with funds from the National Science Foundation and Educational Expeditions International, conducted ex- cavations at the Hudson-Meng Paleo-Indian bison kill in Sioux County. Remains of an additional 80 bison were exposed, mapped, and identified. This brings the faunal count to 300 animals that have been analyzed, with approximately one-half the bone bed still un- excavated. A Cody knife was discovered in association with other butchering tools, waste flakes, and Alberta points. A date of 9400 years ago makes this the oldest occurrence of the Cody knife. Its association with Alberta points calls for an updating of the Cody Complex and its relationships in the High Plains. COLORADO. Elizabeth A. Morris directed the Plains section of the Colorado State University Archaeological Field School in work at the Spring Gulch site near Livermore, with Ronald Kainer as field foreman. Kainer and Ted Norman Ohr are conducting survey and excavations of more than 30 sites to be affected by six water control structures on Boxelder Creek, near Wellington in Larimer County. Morris and Calvin H. Jennings are directing the survey of the Bureau of Reclamation Narrows Unit Project on the South Platte River in Morgan and Weld Counties, with the assistance of Bruce J. Lutz (Univer- sity of Northern Colorado). Location and evaluation of hundreds of prehistoric habitation and quarry sites and the definition of settlement patterns is under way. Timonthy J. Kloberdantz is conducting research on several stage coach stations in the narrows project area built and burned on the Overland Trail in the 1860s. James Benedict is continuing his survey and excava- tion of high altitude camp sites and gamedrives in the Colorado Front Range. KANSAS. John Reynolds (Kansas State Historical Society) reviewed 67 state and federal highway pro- posals. Thirty-nine of these projects required field surveys. One hundred forty-five new sites were located during these activities. A Middle Woodland burial mound located in the 1-435 Highway right-of-way in the Kansas City area was excavated. The circular limestone mound contained a central burial chamber with the remains of several partially cremated and badly fragmented human skeletons. A Middle Woodland camp site belonging to the Grasshopper Falls phase was exposed during bridge construction work. A second site contained evidence of a Pomona Focus level, at least two Middle Woodland lodges, and a more deeply buried Monkers Creek phase, Archaic camp site. Tom Barr (Kansas State Historical Society) worked on plans for historic site development of old Fort Scott and Fort Larned for the National Park Service. He aided the Fort Riley Historical Society in primary research on the furnishing and architecture of an officers' building once used by Custer. Library and field research was also carried out on the burial place of the Prophet, a Shawnee Indian, near Kansas City. The suspected burial area was to be altered by earth moving machinery. Barr also worked on the Mine Creek Battlefield site and the Pottawatomie Baptist Mission. Alfred E. Johnson (University of Kansas) directed a number of projects including Richard Rogers' John Redmond Reservoir survey supported by the National Park Service. Over 30 unrecorded sites were found covering a time span from about 8500 years ago to recent times. At several sites, pavements of burned stones whose function is unknown were found beneath Woodland artifacts. Larry J. Schmits, aided by Ken Reid and Ken Brown (University of Kansas), continued excavations at the Coffey site located in alluvial deposits along the bank of the Big Blue River in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir. The site has produced one of the most extensive cultural sequences in the Central Plains ranging from Early to Late Archaic (7000 B.C.-A.D. 1). Work this past season centered on the excavation of several later Archaic horizons. To date, 13 stratified levels at Locality 1 and an additional four levels at Locality 2 have been identified. Data recovered will be useful in reconstructing settlement and subsistence 487</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY patterns, and the broader questions of the adaptation of Plains Archaic cultures to fluctuations in the Holocene climatic sequence. Funds for the project were provided by the National Park Service, University of Kansas, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Patricia J. O'Brien (Kansas State University) directed the Kansas Archaeological Field School near El Dorado. The school was staffed by personnel from the University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Washburn University. Three sites were excavated: 14GR51, 14BU4, and 14BU19. Funding was furnished by a National Park Service contract, to permit archaeological research in the impoundment area for the proposed El Dorado Reservoir, as well as by the two state universities. One site, 14GR51 located on the Fall River near Eureka, was excavated under the supervision of Darrell Fulmer, aided by Sarah Covill (both University of Kansas). A hearth over 2 m below the surface was eroding out of the riverbank. One fragmentary chert biface (perhaps a knife fragment), chert flakes, fire- reddened limestone, charcoal, mussel shells, and a very few bone fragments and charred seeds were recovered, but no time-sensitive artifacts. The two other sites in the El Dorado Reservoir impoundment area were 14BU4 and 14BU19, both on the Walnut River. At 14BU4, two components were located. Materials recovered include Plains Woodland sherds and stone tools in the plow zone and Plains Archaic materials approximately 1.5 m below the surface dating prior to 2000 B.C. Site 14BU19 excavated by Michael Heffner (University of Kansas) had two Plains Woodland occupations, one above the other. Diagnostic artifacts and radiocarbon samples were recovered. A special program of research in soil chemistry, focused on delineating site boundaries by chemical differences, was directed by chemist Douglas Zabel (Washburn University) at all three of the above sites. As part of the University of Oklahoma field school, Richard A. Pailes and Sheila J. Vaughn made a surface collection at 14My501, just across the Oklahoma border in Kansas, prior to its destruction. OKLAHOMA. Robert E. Bell, as general director of the Oklahoma River Basin Survey supervised a number of projects. John D. Hartley (Oklahoma River Basin Survey) tested three sites in the proposed Kaw Reservoir: The Greenhagen site (Ka-92), the Herbert Shelters site (Ka-91), and the Bryson site (Ka-5). The Greenhagen site seems to have been a chert collection station. Five bluff shelters were investigated at Ka-91, but deposits were generally shallow, and most of the habitations appear to have related to the Late Village horizon on the southern Plains. A trash mound was tested at Ka-5, a protohistoric Wichita site. Marshall Gettys (Oklahoma River Basin Survey) conducted work in the Birch Creek and Skiatook Reservoir area. Six sites were tested, two extensively, an open, Archaic period site (Os-160), and a Woodland bluff shelter (Os-90/91), both in the Skiatook Reservoir area. W. L. Neal (Oklahoma River Basin Survey) re- surveyed the Wister Lake area. Twenty-four new sites, as well as data on the effects of inundation and erosion upon them, were recorded. Four sites, Lf-5, Lf-10, Lf-11, and Lf-226, were tested; the first three were Fourche Maline occupations, while Lf-226 is Archaic. Richard A. Pailes (University of Oklahoma), general director, and Sheila J. Vaughn, field director led a field school in the Copan Reservoir. Two sites, Wn-45 and Wn-6, were tested. In a rock mound cluster, Wn-45, three mounds were tested. The second site, Wn-6 is an open site along the bank of the Caney River. A survey was also conducted along the river and three additional sites were located. TEXAS. Joseph Gallagher (Southern Methodist University) directed excavations in Squaw Creek Valley focusing on the Hopewell School site (X41SV30) with support from the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station. The Archaic midden was shallow, and 308 m2 were stripped to bedrock, exposing two hearths and a large concentration of animal bones, predominantly deer. Artifacts recovered suggest a limited occupation based on collecting, mussel gathering, and hunting. The site is tentatively dated at 2500 B.C. S. Alan Skinner (Southern Methodist University) directed a study of the archaeological and historical resources within portions of Archer, Clay, and Wichita Counties, as part of a feasibility study for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District. The study produced much data on the early historic utilization of the area, but little on the prehistoric use since only three sites were located. Under sabbatical support from Southern Method- ist, Joel Shiner excavated a late Archaic burned-rock midden near Leakey, Texas. Stratified sampling, multiple typologies, and computer analysis demon- strated a camp of ten households, each self-sufficient in all tool-making and maintenance activities. No craft specialists were detected, and no participation in ceremonial activity left any traces. Most economic activity centered around the use of small earth covered ovens and open flat griddles. With a guess date of A.D. 500?500 years, it is speculated that this is representa- tive of a decline in the efficiency of subsystems to withstand disturbing influences from Mexico, the Southwest and possibly from the Woodland area to the east. J. Barto Arnold, III (Texas Antiquities Committee) has carried out several successful proton magneto- meter surveys: one with George Kegley (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department) at Hueco Tanks (41EP2) near El Paso, a prehistoric Jornada branch Mogollon pit house village; a second on the late nineteenth century river steamboat "Black Cloud" (41LB37) in the Trinity River near Liberty; a third with James Malone (Texas Historical Commission) at the Kirbee Kiln site (41MQ38) an early Anglo site in East Texas. A fourth was the Texas Antiquities Committee, Underwater Archaeological Research Section's major marine archaeological magnetometer survey of twenty- five miles of the South Texas coast. Thomas R. Hester (University of Texas at San Antonio) conducted excavations at Chaparrosa Ranch in Zavala County. The major emphasis was placed on "horizontal" or "open area" excavations at 41ZV83, a late prehistoric/protohistoric occupation site. Hester, as director of the Center for Archaeological Research 488 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH at the university, conducted a number of archae- ological assessments for the USDA Soil Conservation Service, with major surveys undertaken in Starr, Bexar, Jim Wells, and Comal Counties. In Starr County, 8000 acres encompassed in floodwater retard- ing structure projects were surveyed under the field direction of J. Parker Nunley (Dallas). Professional and amateur archaeologists in south- central and southern Texas have joined together to form the Southern Texas Archaeological Association, headquartered in San Antonio. The organization has a membership of 280, and is publishing a quarterly newsletter (La Tierra). Eileen Johnson and Charles Johnson (Texas Tech Museum), with funding from the National Geographic Society, supervised operations at the Lubbock Lake site assisted by Vance Holliday. Geologic investiga- tions have determined only five major culture bearing strata but have also disclosed several previously un- known sub-strata for a total of 12 cultural levels. The site has a cultural sequence from Clovis to Historic times with work being done on a mammoth bone bed in the Clovis period and several late Paleo-Indian occupation levels. H. L. Alexander (Simon Fraser University) ex- cavated the Levi site (41Tu49) near Austin, looking specifically for materials to date the Clovis and Pre-Clovis zones. A significant series of flakes and cracked and burned bone were found to exist in the Pre-Clovis zone. IOWA. Dale R. Henning (University of Nebraska- Lincoln) directed an archaeological survey and con- ducted excavations on three sites within the Perry Creek Reservoir with the support of National Park Service. Excavations on the Larson site (13PM61) produced evidence for occupation by late Great Oasis-Mill Creek peoples. The Vondrak site (13PM62) had a 30-ft long row of closely-spaced posts, possibly a portion of a stockade or fortification constructed to protect the Great Oasis village site immediately to the east. A bog located 300 yds west of the Vondrak site produced layers of carbonaceous material separated by clay. It was cored to a depth of 16 ft. At least 25 more sites will be affected by the project. MISSOURI. Michael J. Fuller (Southwest Missouri State University) directed the James River Basin Archaeological Project, with support from the Youth- grants Division, National Endowment for the Humanities. Project consultants, all from Southwest Missouri State University, were Robert Cooley, John Northrip, and Charles Collins. Research was con- centrated in the County Line Reservoir area and along a rerouted section of Highway D where 12 sites were located. Three major sites were excavated to provide data concerning intra-site settlement patterns and local stratigraphy. The majority of sites located represent the Archaic and Early Woodland with a limited number of Late Woodland to protohistoric ones. Dale R. Henning (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) has initiated a survey of the Cannon Reservoir in northeast Missouri. This work is supported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is under the field supervision of William J. Hunt, Jr. PATRICIA J. O'BRIEN GREAT BASIN AND CALIFORNIA IDAHO. In 1974 B. Robert Butler and Giovanna Nendorfer (Both Idaho State University) excavated an extensive, shallow Northern Shoshone camp site near the northern end of the Blackfoot Reservoir. A stratified sampling scheme was employed in the excavations. Radiocarbon dates obtained were: 720?70 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1230 (WSU 1478), from an earth oven 45 cm below ground surface and tentatively associated with Northern Shoshone pottery; and 450?80 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1500 (WSU 1441) from another site feature. The 1974 season of excavations at Dry Creek Rockshelter in southwest Idaho was completed by Gary Webster and Kristina Peterson (Boise State University), under funding by the National Endow- ment for the Humanities and Boise State University. The site is a stratified deposit in a riparian setting within the general artemisia zone of the foothills north of Boise. The establishment of a cultural chronology was the primary goal of the project. The artifact inventory is dominated by projectile points, including large side-notched, stemmed indented base, lanceolate, and large and small corner-notched types. Small assemblages of scrapers, knives and bone tools, plus a clay anthropomorphic figurine were also recovered. The deposit should represent the Late Altithermal and Medithermal periods. CALIFORNIA. Michael Moratto, Steven Wilson and Lynn Riley (all San Francisco State University) excavated a two-component seasonal (spring/summer) shell midden (Mrn-14) on the shore of Richardson's Bay, in Marin County. An infant burial associated with 360 thin rectangular Olivella beads, Haliotis orna- ments, and laurel-leaf obsidian bifaces was dated at 1230?80 radiocarbon years: A.D. 720 (1-7935). A second date for the site is 1345 ?80 radiocarbon years: A.D. 605 (1-7936). The burial, together with finds from sites Mrn-20 and Mrn-27, reinforces Tom King's hypothesis that rank ascription among Bay Area hunters and gatherers has considerable time depth. Moratto, Bert Gerow (Stanford), and Ron Hansen (College of San Mateo) conducted mitigative excava- tions at the shell midden SMa-6 in San Mateo County. Moratto, assisted by others, completed survey and reconnaissance projects along the San Mateo County coast and in Lake, Napa, San Joaquin, Marin and Calaveras counties. Emma Lous Davis (Los Angeles County Museum) has continued previously reported research at China Lake. The research has defined a variety of Paleo- Indian ecological adaptations to the area and the geochronology and paleoecology have been better defined, especially the rise and fall of the lake and associated marsh areas. DON D. FOWLER SOUTHEAST The time has come for me to take my place among the temporally ordered strata of retired Assistant Editors for Current Research, Southeast. This report is the fifth and terminal component in my phase. If ever 489</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY excavated and reread, these five components can be seriated between the Hester Davis phase and that of my successor. When viewed from the vantage point of the history of archaeology, the research reported herein for the Southeast between A.D. 1970 and 1975 can be designated either retrospectively as post-classic or, preferentially and prospectively, as early formative. When viewed against the backdrop of the classic 1930s, the tempo and creativity of contemporary archaeology in the Southeast has declined. On the average we are less innovative, less productive, and less exciting than our predecessors. If, however, we take the best of the research currently being done in the Southeast and view the immediate future as an extension and amplification of the interrogative, in- vestigative, and organizational patterns emergent in this work, then we are today only in the early formative of a developing Southeastern archaeology. I believe this latter view is correct; that we are building on the strong foundations of the archaic rather than drifting along in a post-classic decline. I owe a very real, consciously felt debt to all who have provided me with the information from which I wrote these reports. I received from my predecessor an active and articulate group of correspondents. Most of these individuals have become colleagues; many have become friends. Additional sources of information, new colleagues and new friends have been added to the network which is so necessary for an undertaking such as this. To all, my thanks. ALABAMA. The Office of Archaeological Re- search, University of Alabama (OAR) has completed salvage and survey within the Little Bear Creek Reservoir in northwest Alabama. Carey B. Oakley (OAR) excavated a series of pre-Copena stone-covered burial mounds. Other work included excavation of a single component site containing McKelvey ceramics and a multicomponent Archaic site; these sites have been analyzed by Eugene Futato (OAR). J. B. Graham and Charles Hubbert (OAR) have shown that much of the chert debitage from sites in the Little Bear Creek area came from cobbles that were heat treated prior to flaking. J. B. Graham (OAR) directed the salvage of two sites in northeast Alabama: (1) a Late Woodland- Mississippi period site located on the grounds of the Bellefonte Power Plant and (2) a Copena burial mound at the proposed site of the Murphy Hill Power Plant. The OAR, in cooperation with the Department of Anthropology, University of Alabama, conducted limited excavations at Tuscaloosa's Collier-Boone Home; building stages from 1821 to 1935 were verified and mapped. ARKANSAS. The Arkansas Archeological Survey (AAS) completed its third and final field season at the Ferguson site, a small fourteenth century Caddoan ceremonial center in southwest Arkansas. Frank Schambach (AAS, Southern State College) directed the excavations. Almost all of the survey archaeolo- gists have participated in this excavation during the three seasons. A processing lab was directed by Norma Hoffrichter. Student archaeologists who stayed with the project from start to finish were Robert A. Taylor, field foreman (Arkansas), Diane B. Taylor, strati- grapher and registrar, Stephen Loring (Goddard Col- lege), David Kelley (Kansas), and James Mullins (Arkansas). Two Caddo mounds, a two-platform temple mound and a dome-shaped burial mound, were com- pletely excavated and yielded new information on the construction and functions of Caddo mounds of this period. Extensive excavation in midden areas beneath and around the mounds gave clear evidence that when the mounds were in use the site was a "vacant" ceremonial center with no structures other than those on or directly associated with the mounds. The single Caddo structure found off the mounds was a circular house 15 m in diameter. Associated sherds and pipe fragments indicated that it was in use about A.D. 1100, well before the mounds were constructed. The major component in the extremely rich middens was Fourche Maline, and the abundant ceramics, including some imported Marksville specimens, indicate that this occupation dates to about A.D. 400, at which time the site was a two-acre village. The Certification Program for amateurs of the AAS and the Arkansas Archeological Society was operated in conjunction with the Ferguson excavations for three weeks each season. Approximately 300 people from some 30 states participated. These people provided more than half of the man hours that went into the excavations; in return they received classroom instruction in archaeological techniques and related subjects and obtained closely supervised field experi- ence. Charles R. McGimsey III (Director, AAS) and Hester Davis (State Archeologist) organized and directed this program; various Survey archaeologists served as instructors. Daniel Wolfman (AAS, Arkansas Polytechnic) is processing archaeomagnetic samples from the Ferguson site and is attempting to set up a floating dendrochronology based on the 900-odd carbonized logs recovered from partially burned temples and houses in the mounds. Robert A. Taylor (Arkansas- Fayetteville) is analyzing the Caddoan ceramics; Jerome Rose (Alabama-Birmingham) and Mary Powell are studying the Fourche Maline and Caddo skeletons; and James A. Christian (Louisiana Tech) is processing and reporting on pollen samples. Ann M. Early (AAS, Henderson State) continued research into the Caddoan occupation of the Ouachita River valley. Test excavations were carried out at the Hedges site, a late Caddo habitation and mortuary site. The skeletal population recovered from the site and donated to the Survey by lay archaeologists has been sent to the University of Alabama, Birmingham along with comparative populations from Caddoan mortuary sites in south-central and southwest Arkansas. Test excavations were conducted at the Raymond Lake and Coon Island sites in Bradley County by Joseph J. Lischka (AAS, Arkansas-Monticello) in connection with the long range research project of Prehistoric occupation of the middle Ouachita River valley. The two sites contained early and late Archaic, Marksville, and Coles Creek components. Pheriba Stacy replaced Joseph Lischka with the AAS in December, 1974, and will continue research in the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge on the middle Ouachita River. Daniel Wolfman joined the AAS (Arkansas Polytechnic) in August, 1973, and con- 490 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH ducted a preliminary survey in the Buffalo National River for the National Park Service. He is also developing a research base for archaeomagnetic dating of sites in Arkansas and dendrochronology in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains. Dan F. Morse (AAS, Arkansas State) directed excavations at the Sloan site, a possible Dalton cemetery in northeast Arkansas which dates between 8500 and 7000 B.C. An 11X12 m area in a sand dune contained 144 pristine Dalton points up to 12 cm long, 30 adzes, 89 preforms, 36 end scrapers, 55 abraders, and 88 other artifacts. Over 200 small bone fragments were collected. The artifact placement indicated up to 12 extended burials. Six hundred soil samples were taken to test for the presence of bone. This may be the earliest true cemetery found in the New World. Morse also continued research on the Nodena phase project with excavations at the Nodena and Armorel sites in Mississippi County to learn more about the geographical extent of this late Mississippian phase, settlement pattern, house types, the diet and kitchen pottery of the inhabitants, and possible craft specialization. Michael Million is studying the ceramic technology of Mississippian pottery. He has discovered through X-ray diffraction that burned shell, as calcium carbonate, alters the physical and chemical properties of fine-grained alluvial clays to reduce their plasticity and shrinkage. This change allows for the vast increase in quantity and diversity of the Mississippian ceramics. Replication experiments with successful firings of vessels have been accomplished. Burney B. McClurkan (AAS, Arkansas-Pine Bluff) continued analysis of data collected from two seasons of excavation at the Moore Bayou site, Arkansas County, with Coles Creek, Mississippian, and early Historic components. Research also continued on the location of both Woodland and Mississippian farm- steads relative to major tributaries of the lower Arkansas and lower White Rivers to determine settle- ment patterns. Martha A. Rolingson (AAS, Arkansas-Fayetteville) continued research on the Bayou Bartholomew project in the Arkansas-Mississippi alluvial valley of south- eastern Arkansas. The current research emphasis on this project is to reconstruct environmental conditions existing about A.D. 1200-1850 through archival data. Preliminary archaeological field studies were con- ducted for the Soil Conservation Service in 17 watersheds throughout Arkansas, and various surveys and testing programs were conducted under contract with the Corps of Engineers. From June 1973 to November 1974 the AAS, under contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, undertook a multistage program of survey, testing, and other research in order to estimate the nature, extent, and significance of the archaeological resources of the 2000 mi2 Cache River basin in northeast Arkansas, to assess direct and indirect impacts of a proposed channelization project on those resources, and to recommend appropriate mitigation measures. Probability sampling and testing of seven sites (including the possible Dalton cemetery) provided new basic data, while previous records, reconnaissance, and earlier research contributed other essential information. The principal aim of the Cache Project was to demonstrate that contract archaeology can and must meet the high standards of modern archaeological research-for purposes related both to contract fulfill- ment and professional obligations. To achieve this goal, several research designs were set in operation during the survey and testing program, including a test of Morse's Dalton settlement pattern hypotheses. An additional series of ten independent research designs ranging over substantive, technical, methodological, and theoretical problems was formulated to aid in assessing research potential and to provide a baseline for future research. Research continues under the direction of Charles R. McGimsey III and Ervan Garrison on archaeological dating with alpha-recoil tracks. Measurements of the track densities over large areas of inclusions are being shown to correlate reasonably well with archaeologi- cally suggested times for sets of Hohokam and Florida sherds. FLORIDA. The staff of the Florida Division of Archives, History, and Records Management (DAH &amp; RM) conducted site surveys in the northern half of Jefferson County, within the city of Apalachicola, and along the right of way of 1-10 and 1-75 in northern Florida. Robert Carr (DAH &amp; RM) directed a survey of 14,000 acres of the Lake Okeechobee watershed; he also surveyed areas within Broward County. William Browning (DAH &amp; RM) conducted surveys on phosphate-rich lands in Hillsborough County which are slated for strip mining. Jeanne Fryman (DAH &amp; RM) excavated the Crystal Beach site (8Pil3), an Archaic comp6nent in Pinellas County. William Browning salvaged the Rocky Point 2 site (8Mt33), a Glades II-III period site in Manatee County. James Miller (DAH &amp; RM) directed research at the Brokaw-McDougall house in Tallahas- see. This mid-nineteenth century home is being restored as a Bicentennial project. David Brose (Case-Western Reserve) directed ex- cavations at 8Ja7, a large Fort Walton mound and village located on the Apalachicola River. Karl T. Steinem (Florida) excavated a Cades Pond village in Alachua County, and confirmed that the terminal date for such sites is post A.D. 850. GEORGIA. The Department of Anthropology, University of Florida has completed the fifth season of research on St. Simon's Island. A series of aboriginal sites dating from before 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1650 have been excavated under the direction of Charles H. Fairbanks and Jerald T. Milanich. Preliminary analysis of the excavated materials has provided a sketch of the chronology and subsistence-settlement patterns for coastal Georgia. The earliest, Sapelo period (pre-1500 B.C.) is characterized by shell-ring middens containing fiber- tempered pottery. Faunal remains show an emphasis on foods from the marsh biome, e.g., shellfish, fish, and turtle. Later in the Sapelo period (about 1500-900 B.C.) there is evidence for increasing utilization of land animals in the diet. The next period (about 900-500 B.C.) contains components which have been designated the Refuge culture. Sites from this period contain both fiber-tempered and sand-tempered simple stamped pottery. Sporadic occupations directed to- 491</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ward fishing and hunting are suggested by the ephemeral nature of the sites. Subsequent Deptford sites (about 500 B.C.-A.D. 700) are small circular shell middens, containing plain, check stamped, and simple stamped sand-tempered pottery. These sites seem to be adjuncts to major settlements inland. Sites from the Wilmington and Savannah periods (about A.D. 700-1500) carry on with subsistence strategies begun in the Deptford period: other than changes in ceramic types, site contents indicate short-term occupations which exploited deer, fish, and turtles. The Pine Harbor period, which is linked to the historic Guale Indians (A.D. 1540-1600), is marked by increased use of the coastal strand by the inhabitants. Ceramics are varied and include cord marked and complicated stamped sand-, clay-, and grit-tempered vessels. Some sites have burial and platform mounds. The founding of the Jesuit mission on the island may have been responsible for the increased size and seasonal dura- tion of these settlements. The Historic San Marcos (Altamaha) period is associated with the Franciscan missions to the Guale. This period (A.D. 1600-1650) evinces a shift to year-round occupation of the coast. In addition to increased utilization of shellfish (the largest coastal shell middens are from this period), the percentage of alligator and sturgeon in the diet increases and deer hunting declines. Both hunting and horticulture show the results of new techniques introduced by the Franciscans. Some villages from this period have associated council houses, charnel houses, and ceremonial mounds, of which some contain burials. Additional work on St. Simon's Island has focused on the Historic Sea Island cotton plantation economy. Portions of the Cannon's Point Plantation have been excavated under the direction of Charles H. Fairbanks. John S. Otto (Florida) has compared the lifestyle of planters, overseers and slaves as represented in con- temporary documents and modem historiography with that mirrored by the archaeological record. As one experiment, the food bone from contexts as- sociated with the above three social classes was analyzed and compared. The diet of all three groups included both wild and domestic animals and was far more varied than that presented in the recent book Time on the Cross by Robert W. Fogelman and Stanley R. Engerman. Historic archaeology on St. Simon's under the direction of Charles H. Fairbanks also included work at Fort Frederica National Monument. The backyards of two colonial period lots were excavated by Nicholas Honerkamp (Florida). Numerous trash pits, post holes, and quantities of food bone were recovered. The Laboratory of Archaeology, University of Georgia, under the direction of Roy S. Dickens, Jr. is surveying De Kalb, Gwinnett, and Clayton Counties for the National Register of Historic Places. These counties are in the path of Atlanta's urban sprawl. The Laboratory of Archaeology continues its work on the preservation of aboriginal soapstone quarries near Atlanta, and on the Horseshoe Bend Project. KENTUCKY. Excavations were carried out May- July 1974 by William H. Marquardt (Missouri) and Patty Jo Watson (Washington-St. Louis) at the Carlston Annis (15Bt5) and Bowles (150h13) shell mounds. Objectives were to recover a stratigraphic series of mussel shell for identification and soil for flotation. Approximately 800 10-12 pound bags of soil were floated, and the recovered shell and botanical materials are currently being analyzed. Two radio- carbon dates have been obtained from work done at Carlston Annis in March 1972. These are 4040?180 radiocarbon years: 2090 B.C. (UCLA 1845B) and 4250?80 radiocarbon years: 2300 B.C. (UCLA 1845A) from depths of 105-120 cm and 135-150 cm, respectively. The abundance of hickory and other nutshells in the Carlston Annis flotation materials confirms that the Middle to Late Archaic inhabitants of the Green River region were making good use of the food resources provided by an oak-hickory forest. Indications are that plant foods were as important as, if not more important than, molluscan and mam- malian faunal resources. The nuts found in great abundance are available in the early fall months (September and October) as are most of the other plant species known to be present there (persimmon, plum, sumac, chenopod, viburnum, poke seed). The weight of evidence suggests that Carlston Annis was occupied in late summer and fall. MISSISSIPPI. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDA &amp; H) has begun a site survey of U.S. Soil Conservation Service projects in the state. This work has been directed by John T. Pennman (MDA &amp; H). Test excavations directed by Sam Brooks (MDA &amp; H) at the Hester Site in Monroe County revealed a 5 ft deep stratified midden. The basal levels yielded Dalton and Early Archaic components; a Clovis point was found in a disturbed area. A feature containing a Decatur point from the lower levels of this site was dated at 8335?305 radiocarbon years: 6385 B.C. (UGa-863). Intensive excavation has been scheduled at this site. John Connaway (MDA &amp; H) and Carolyn Caldwell (MDA &amp; H) directed salvage work at the Flower's #3 site, a Mississippi period village in Tunica County. They uncovered 18 house patterns which were located along an old natural levee of the Mississippi River. A small cemetery was located just to the east of the village. The University of Mississippi field school, directed by Robert M. Thorne, continued excavation at the Slaughter site (22La513) in the north-central part of the state. An archaeomagnetic date places one of the Woodland components of this stratified site early in the eighth century A.D. SOUTH CAROLINA. The Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of South Carolina (IAA), directed by Robert L. Stephenson, hosted the annual meetings of the Society for Historical Archae- ology and the International Conference on underwater archaeology. Over 500 people attended. During summer 1974 Richard F. Carrillo (IAA), assisted by students from Brown, Kansas, Wayne State, and East Carolina Universities, conducted re- search in the Piedmont area. Excavations were under- taken at King's Mountain National Military Park and at Brattonsville, an eighteenth century settlement. The excavations at Brattonsville focused on a late eighteen- th century log cabin. The work at King's Mountain 492 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH included excavation at an early nineteenth century stone house and a survey of the Park. The second season of inventorying the archaeolog- ical resources of the Atomic Energy Commission's Savannah River Plant has been completed. This project was carried out by David G. Anderson and Robert Asreen under the direction of John D. Combes (IAA). Susan Jackson (IAA) continued documentary and field research on eighteenth century Lower Cherokee towns. Leland G. Ferguson (IAA) has developed a long-term research design for the investigation of the South Appalachian Mississippian. Alan B. Albright (IAA) has published new state-wide regulations for underwater archaeology. Three new members have joined the archaeological staff of the IAA: Kenneth E. Lewis, who is involved with the Revolutionary War period site of Camden; Albert C. Goodyear III, whose primary responsibilities include the Highway Program; and Elizabeth C. Sanford, who is now Conservator and director of the Conservation Laboratory. TENNESSEE. Salvage excavations in the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant area near Oak Ridge, Tennessee were conducted between October 1973 and February 1974, and again in December 1974. Gerald F. Schroedl (Tennessee) directed fieldwork at sites 40RE108 and 40RE124. Site 40RE108 included three midden areas designated Areas 1, 2, and 3. Areas 1 and 2 produced stratified Woodland period deposits, in- cluding an Early Woodland period occupation and subsequent Middle Woodland period shell midden. Area 3 was a Mississippi period shell midden. Site 40RE124, a Late Woodland burial mound, was com- pletely excavated, and three mound construction stages, each marked by changes in mound fill and capped with limestone slabs and groups of burned logs, were defined. Thirty-five burials were recovered. Six radiocarbon dates from the site cluster at about A.D. 950, and closely correlate with dates from other Late Woodland period burial mounds in East Ten- nessee. An Early Mississippian midden was situated adjacent to the mound and was covered with colluvial deposits including redeposited mound fill. Excavation of the midden is scheduled for spring 1975. The University of Tennessee's Tellico Archaeolog- ical Project under the direction of Alfred K. Guthe continued excavation in advance of dam construction by the TVA. In 1974 excavation was resumed at four sites on which work was done in 1973: The Tellico Blockhouse (40MR50), Chota (40MR2), Tomotley (40MR5), and Rose Island (40MR44). Excavations in the Tellico Blockhouse were com- pleted under the supervision of Richard R. Polhemus. During the 13 years of occupation (1794-1807) there were three building stages, each one enclosing a larger area. In 1974 primary attention was given to clearing the lower terrace. Evidence of palisade lines was located. The distribution of the cultural material recovered indicates the sequence of occupation and suggests the location of the barracks, officer's quarters and the store. Plans are being drawn up to preserve the stone foundations of the structures and develop the site for public visitations. Approximately six acres of the Overhill Cherokee village of Chota (eighteenth century) was stripped of plow soil by earth moving machines. The purpose of the stripping, supervised by Gerald Schroedl, was to ascertain the settlement pattern. Historic material recovered is being programmed for computer analysis in order to determine associations and distributions. Another Overhill Cherokee settlement, Tomotley, was investigated for a second season under the supervision of J. Worth Greene. This site was also the location of an earlier Dallas occupation. The relation- ship of Dallas structures, features, and burials to those of the Cherokee is being carefully examined. Additional work pertaining to the Cherokee-Dallas relationship was undertaken by Moira H. M. Wright. She measured a number of crania attributable to the Cherokee and Dallas occupations and compared these with each other as well as other populations. She sought to determine the morphological distance between these populations with the aid of multivariate statistical analysis. Although not conclusive, the re- sults of these analyses indicate that the Cherokee were not genetically descended from the Dallas. William D. Hershey, under contract to the Tennessee Valley Authority, continued an archival search for data relating to the Overhill Cherokee and the Tellico Blockhouse. His findings have helped interpret some of the archaeologically recovered materials. One of the most important projects conducted during 1974 was the continued excavation of an Early Archaic site on the downstream end of Rose Island, directed by Jefferson Chapman (North Carolina). Components of a bifurcate-stemmed point tradition, including LeCroy and St. Albans types, were stra- tigraphically separated from a lower horizon which contained Kirk Corner-Notched points. The observed sequence repeated that found at the St. Albans site in West Virginia. In addition to the point types, which are the first of their kind to be recovered from a stratified site in Tennessee, there were examples of a tool complex, including digging tools of slate and limestone, grinding stones, hammerstones, scrapers and other flake tools. The number of pieces esquillees recovered is significant. Approximately 99% of the plant remains associated with the Early Archaic material consisted of hickory and oak. Additional Rose Island radiocarbon dates were obtained from charcoal samples. They indicate an intermittent occupation extending between 9330 and 8020 radiocarbon years ago. Archaeomagnetic samples collected from ten selected hearths in the site by David Thorn (Earth Science Observatory, University of Oklahoma) were analyzed by Robert L. Dubois, of that observatory, and confirm the relative sequence of the radiocarbon dates. Bennie C. Keel (Wright State) directed excavations at the Nowlin II site (40Cf35), a Terminal Archaic site in the Normandy Reservoir. The materials recovered from this site, which included several burials, are the most comprehensive yet on the Wade Phase occupa- tions in the Reservoir. TEXAS. During summer 1974 and January 1975 Timothy Sullivan of the Archaeology Research Pro- gram, Southern Methodist University (SMU) conduct- ed an intensive survey of the proposed Cherokee Trail Lake for the Titus County Fresh Water Supply District 493</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY #1. The lake will be located on Cypress Creek in northeast Texas, and will involve approximately 10,000 acres. Over 100 sites were located within and around the project area, revealing occupation from Archaic to late Caddo (Titus Focus) times. The possible remains of historic Fort Sherman were also located. Testing and excavations at selected sites are scheduled for spring and summer 1975. Archaeological investigations were carried out at two sites on the north side of Lake Lavon in northeast Texas during summer 1974. The project, directed by Mark J. Lynott (SMU) was part of salvage operations necessitated by the enlargement of Lake Lavon. From May through August Jeffrey Richner and T. Reed Lee (SMU) directed archaeological recon- naissance in the area of the proposed Tennessee Colony Reservoir on the Trinity River. The reservoir will inundate 148,000 acres when completed. Five one-half mile wide transects across the floodpool were intensively surveyed. A total of 60 sites was recorded. A stratified random sampling procedure based on soils, plant communities, topography, and exposure will be carried out next season. The area is in the Blackland Prairie/Oak-Hickory Forest ecozone, and the concept of a biological tension zone is the basis for further analysis in the area. The sites range in time from Paleo-Indian through Historic. During January 1975 fieldwork was begun within the construction area of the proposed Lake Fork Creek Reservoir near Quitman. The project, directed by S. Alan Skinner (SMU), is funded by the Sabine River Authority, and its purpose is to satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas. A regional study similar to that advocated by SARG has been developed for use in evaluating the resources that are known to occur within the Upper Sabine River Basin as well as those recorded from the lake area. The survey will be completed in summer 1975 and sites will also be tested at that time. Archaeological research in the proposed Cooper Lake area of northeast Texas was continued during summer 1974 under the direction of Robert Hyatt and Karen Doehner. Excavations were conducted at three sites. Half of the Arnold site (41HP34), located within the South Sulphur River floodplain, was extensively excavated in order to determine its internal structure. Radiocarbon dates indicate occupation between A.D. 500 and 1200, and the artifactual content appears to represent primarily Gibson Aspect occupation. Nine human burials and 12 hearths were exposed. Two terrace edge sites were tested to determine their relationship to sites located within the floodplain. Preliminary analysis indicates that the majority of terrace edge sites may represent temporary occupation during periods of bottomland flooding. Further re- search will be conducted at sites in this area during summer 1975 in order to clarify the settlement/ subsistence model which has been proposed. CHRISTOPHER PEEBLES GREATER SOUTHWEST UTAH. From March to June, 1974, Curtis J. Wilson (University of Utah) conducted several salvage related surveys in various parts of Utah. These surveys included surface collecting, recording, and mapping of many surface sites; test excavations were also made at selected sites. A field school supervised by Jesse D. Jennings (University of Utah) was operated at a Fremont village site located east of Ferron. The village is dated at about A.D. 900-1200, and results of the data analysis have led to a redefinition of the San Rafael and Unita variants of the Fremont culture by the authors of the final report. Salvage operations were conducted in Salina Can- yon by Howard L. Smith (University of Utah). Three Fremont sites assigned to the San Rafael variant and dated between A.D. 700-1200 were partially ex- cavated under the provisions of a contract with the Utah Department of Highways. Claudia Helm Berry (University of Utah) con- ducted an intensive survey of the San Rafael region. In addition to locating 88 new sites, valuable information concerning the vegetation, land forms, and water resources of the area were collected. Sites located include both Fremont and Archaic. Commencing in July and extending into October, a large, deep Archaic site was excavated under the initial direction of Jesse D. Jennings and later Curtis J. Wilson. Radiocarbon dates indicate the site was occupied before 7500 years ago and abandoned 3300 years ago. The presence of over 200 firepits and large quantities of bone and chipped stone indicate a heavy occupation. This site has been recommended for National Register status. William D. Lipe (Museum of Northern Arizona) and R. G. Matson (University of British Columbia) completed surveys for the Cedar Mesa Project, south- eastern Utah. Sites in selected canyon systems were inventoried in the summer, and a stratified random sample was recorded in detail. In the fall, 20 small Pueblo III cliff ruins were intensively studied. Over 600 dendrochronological specimens were collected with the cooperation of Jeffrey Dean (Tree-Ring Laboratory, University of Arizona). These data will contribute to a delineation of prehistoric community boundaries in the canyon areas studied. Continuing paleoenvironmental analyses include palynology by Jim West (University of California at Davis), molluscs by Phil Salkin (University of Wisconsin), and alluvial geology by Larry Agenbroad (Chadron State). Nine badly vandalized Basketmaker and Pueblo Anasazi sites in the Grand Gulch Primitive Area of southeast Utah were mapped and collected in June. The work, supervised by Don Keller (Museum of Northern Arizona), was performed under contract with the Bureau of Land Management. Of primary concern were (1) surface cultural materials, largely burial goods and human bone, which constituted an invitation to further illegal digging, and (2) the mapping and marking of the disturbed areas of the sites. An analysis of the material collected, a recon- struction of past digging activities in the Gulch, and recommendations for restorative measures are in- cluded in a report to the BLM, "Surface Cleanup of Cultural Sites in Grand Gulch." Howard Davidson (Museum of Northern Arizona) supervised archaeological investigations for energy- 494 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH related land development programs in southern Utah. Thirty-six Archaic, Paiute and Virgin Anasazi sites were recorded near Alton, north of Kanab. Eighteen Archaic, Paiute and Fremont sites were located in John's Valley north of Bryce Canyon National Park. NEW MEXICO. Staff of the Archaeology Research Program (Southern Methodist University) inventoried 66 sites on an access road and within a reservoir construction area near Nambe Falls. Excavation of some sites was completed and analysis of recovered data is oriented toward documenting the relationship of ecological, climatic and cultural change in the occupational sequence of the region. Excavated sites included one preceramic site with three radiocarbon dates ranging from 1340 to 2510 years (TX 1992-1994), and three pithouse sites with associated surface rooms. Three 10-30 room adobe walled pueblos produced 14 dendrochronological specimens dating in the middle of the thirteenth century. Only one of the many single room structures in the area was excavated. This was a semisubterranean room pre- sumed occupied in the middle of the fourteenth century on the basis of ceramic associations. During the past year Frances Levine and Charles Mobley (A.R.P., Southern Methodist University) directed survey work at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Los Esteros Lake on the Pecos River near Santa Rosa. The 223 Prehistoric and Historic sites recorded included rockshelters, lithic scatters, open camps, tipi rings, and Historic structures. Ethnohis- torical research and a botanical study of the distribution of plant communities and economic species provided data on land-use patterns and subsis- tence-settlement systems. Mark Henderson (A.R.P., Southern Methodist Uni- versity) conducted a survey of the proposed Brantley Reservoir in southeastern New Mexico north of Carlsbad. Of the 92 Prehistoric and Historic sites located, 54 are directly threatened by the construction of the reservoir. Douglas W. Schwartz (School of American Re- search) continued excavations at Arroyo Hondo Pueblo under funds provided by the National Geo- graphic Society and the N.S.F. This year marked the fifth and final season of work at this large fourteenth and fifteenth century site near Santa Fe, which has served as an archaeological laboratory for the study of factors associated with rapid demographic change. While previous years' work had centered on in-room block excavation, the 1974 fieldwork focused upon site plaza areas and kivas. Excavations initiated in one of the site's 11 plazas in 1973 was completed, and three additional plazas representing both periods of site occupation were extensively cleared. Collectively, the plaza project has provided new information on the use of village space, the loci of specialized activities, mortuary practice, turkey husbandry, and extra-block architectural features, in addition to supplying well controlled stratigraphic samples of importance to all areas of analytic concern. In conjunction with plaza testing, four kivas were either completely or partially excavated, and revealed features which compare well with those documented for kivas of the nearby Pindi site and reported for the Cochiti area. The first two monographs of the Arroyo Hondo series, dealing with the contemporary natural ecology and a coordinated site survey, are expected this year. In addition to the work at Arroyo Hondo, the School undertook a survey and excavation program at Abiquiu Reservoir in the Chama River valley. Work was conducted under the direction of Curtis Schaafs- ma. The survey located 32 sites, which included 12 late Archaic (about 3000 B.C.-A.D. 400), three seven- teenth century Navajo, and one later Historic site. Excavations focused on two large open Archaic stations. A 50% sample of surface artifacts was collected under a checkerboard grid system, and 35 features were either excavated or tested. Laboratory analysis involved the recording of the attributes in nine dimensions for 12,971 lithic artifacts on punch cards. A computer-assisted typology for ordering these artifacts has been developed. Intra-site artifact dis- tribution maps are planned, as are inter-site artifact inventory comparisons. The comparisons will explore the data for functional differences and for a possible social boundary between the sites. Donald Fiero and Anne Hummer (National Park Service, Santa Fe) excavated eight sites in Bandelier National Monument in the fall of 1974. These and 13 additional sites, which will be excavated in 1975, are within the Cochiti Dam inundation area. The 16 Prehistoric sites appear to belong to the Rio Grande Coalition period, A.D. 1200-1325. The remaining five sites are Historic Spanish/Pueblo. George Agogino (Eastern New Mexico University) continued work at Blackwater Draw. As in the past three years, work was concentrated in the recently uncovered Firstview horizon at the site. Staff archaeologists of the Chaco Center (National Park Service), directed by Robert H. Lister, continued investigations in Chaco Canyon National Monument. Geological, geographical, biological, and ethnographic investigations are being conducted concurrent with the archaeological projects. Alden Hayes completed the survey of the area, recording over 2000 sites in and adjacent to the monument. He also excavated a series of Pueblo I and II sites. Jim Judge, who joined the Center staff in 1974, assisted Hayes in the field and is involved in a variety of analytical studies. Faunal and other analyses of materials recovered from a pre- ceramic site have been conducted by Tom Mathews. The application of remote sensing to the identification of cultural and natural features and for mapping archaeological sites continues to be supervised by Tom Lyons. Dave Brugge has worked with a number of Navajo informants regarding the history of certain Navajo sites in the area. Frank Hibben (University of New Mexico) con- tinued excavations at the site of Comanche Springs, some 20 mi south of Albuquerque. The site has shown a broad spectrum of cultures from early Paleo-Indian to modern times. The 1974 excavations were chiefly in the bison layer which was identified as Desert Archaic, and in a fortified Spanish hacienda dated at A.D. 1600. Steven LeBlanc (UCLA) began a long-term project in the Mimbres Valley of southwestern New Mexico. Excavations were conducted at five sites: (1) LA12110, a presumed A.D. 300 pithouse village; (2) LA12076, a 25-room Mimbres phase pueblo; (3) 495</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY LA767 (Mattocks site), a large Mimbres phase pueblo; (4) LA12110, a small, possibly seasonally occupied five-room Mimbres phase pueblo; and (5) LA12077, a 30-room post-Animas phase (?) adobe walled pueblo with certain Salado affinities. A preliminary report is available. ARIZONA. A revival of the Museum of Northern Arizona Ceramic Series was effected with the publica- tion of a volume on Mesa Verde ceramics. The editorial work is being conducted by the staff of the Ceramic Repository (MNA). Each volume is prepared as a field guide to ceramic types. Kathleen Gratz (Museum of Northern Arizona) is currently analyzing ceramic assemblages from site locations in the Perry Mesa-Black Mesa region of south-central Arizona. Two of the sites on Perry Mesa show Hohokam affiliation, while several others have indications of Salado occupation. The analysis in- dicates that pottery was made in the vicinity, and that many locally produced vessels were imitations of wares (Salado polychromes, Salt River redwares) from other localities. Howard Davidson (Museum of Northern Arizona) conducted a survey of 880 acres proposed for the Hopi High School Educational Complex east of First Mesa. Ceramics from the 46 sites recorded indicate a strong affiliation with Kayenta and Tusayan tradi- tions. Dating indicates occupation from Pueblo I through the Historic period with the highest frequency during the Pueblo III and IV periods. James E. Bradford (Museum of Northern Arizona) made an extensive archaeological survey in the St. Johns, Concho, and Snowflake areas of eastern Arizona under contract with the Salt River Project. Subsequent excavation of 18 sites was initiated at the Coronado Generating Station near St. Johns. Investiga- tions produced a large, basalt Gypsum Cave projectile point and material from Archaic, Basketmaker II, and Pueblo I, II, and III occupations. Several pithouses (Pueblo II-early Pueblo III) were excavated. The Black Mesa Archaeological Project, under the direction of Robert C. Euler and John A. Ware III, excavated two sites during the 1974 field season. A Lolomai phase (Basketmaker II) site produced 36 cultural features including slab-based pit structures and extra-mural hearths, cooking and storage pits. Radiocarbon dates range from 50 B.C. to 260 B.C.; the younger date was from charred roof beams upon which carbonized corn was lying. The second site consisting of two pithouses and an L-shaped row of jacal rooms, was essentially of the Dinnebito phase (Pueblo I) with a minor Toreva phase (Pueblo II-III) component. Tree-ring dates tend to cluster in the late A.D. 700s and late A.D. 1000s. Thor N. V. Karlstrom (U.S. Geological Survey) continued his studies of the paleo-environment of Black Mesa. John Clonts (Arizona Archeological Center, National Park Service) assisted the Bureau of Indian Affairs Joint Use Area Commission in surveying 30 mi of the Hopi-Navajo Joint Use Area fence line. Robert Ellis (BIA, JUA) will continue the survey of the remaining 320 mi under National Park Service super- vision. Data from a 29-room Pueblo III structure in the Upper Little Colorado River region of east-central Arizona has been analyzed by Glen DeGarmo (UCLA). The analysis concentrated on interpretation of the probable tasks formerly performed with various arti- facts and the distributions of those tasks between the three contemporaneously occupied roomblocks of the structure. Several archaeologically unreported tools were identified including potter's turntables (Pukis), potter's mullers, and basket splint sizers. The distribu- tions of tasks were interpreted to mean that one of the roomblocks either was unoccupied or was used as an interior work space, and the other two roomblocks were domestic residence areas with different domestic groups in residence as differentiated by tasks probably performed by males and females. The systematic organization evidenced in this small pueblo is inter- preted as probably related to a regional network of interacting settlements. Fred Plog (SUNY Binghamton), James N. Hill (UCLA), and Steve Plog (University of Michigan) directed the continuing work of the Chevelon Archae- ological Research Project. Survey efforts focused on a random sampling of drainages immediately to the east of Chevelon. Approximately 250 new sites were located. Sample excavations and intensive survey collections were made at ten sites as part of Steve Plog's study of the spatial, temporal, and functional determinants of design variation and in an effort to build a more substantial understanding of subsistence practices in the area. The Central Arizona Project (Southern Illinois University-Prescott College), an NSF sponsored pro- ject under the direction of George Gumerman and John Hanson, is currently in the second field season in the Black Canyon City-New River region. Two major problem areas are being investigated: hydrological aspects of Prehistoric farming situations, and the relationships between natural and cultural boundaries. The project area encompasses both the Lower and Upper Sonoran life zones and the ecotone that separates the two. The 1975 field season is con- centrating on the excavation of a hilltop masonry pueblo of 80-100 rooms and a systematic site survey of the three major environmental zones in the test area. Sites are being recorded utilizing the SARG data format. Donald E. Weaver, Jr. was appointed to direct the new Office of Cultural Resource Management at Arizona State University. Several studies were con- ducted in the first year of operation. James Rodgers surveyed the Cave Buttes Dam Alternative site north of Phoenix for the Army Corps of Engineers. Using a 10% sampling strategy coupled with an overall general survey, Rodgers documented collecting, gathering, agricultural, and domestic activities in an area previously considered archaeologically sterile. The Soil Conservation Service contracted for three archaeologi- cal surveys and one excavation. Susan Burton surveyed the locations for flood control structures in the Harquahala Valley west of Phoenix. Thomas Cartledge surveyed the locations of similar structures near Apache Junction east of Phoenix and James Rodgers directed excavations at a Prehistoric and Historic site in the same area. Rodgers also directed a survey of a proposed flood control structure near Williams A.F.B. southeast of Phoenix. 496 [Vol. 40, No. 4, 1975]</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT RESEARCH John Clonts (Arizona Archeological Center, Na- tional Park Service) assisted the U.S. Air Force with a survey and testing program at Williams A.F.B. near Chandler. The work indicates that the Midvale site is only one of several archaeological resources in the W.A.F.B. archaeological district. S. J. Olsen (University of Arizona and Arizona State Museum) has assumed responsibility for the faunal laboratory of the Arizona Archeological Center of the National Park Service in Tucson. At present, faunal analysis is being conducted on materials from the sites of Awatovi, Gran Quivira, Cozumel, Grass- hopper Pueblo, Pecos Pueblo, and the Historic site of Tubac near Tucson. The entire collection of animal remains from Ventana Cave, one of the earliest sites in the Southwest, is also being considered for restudy. A four year grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities was recently awarded to James E. Ayres (Arizona State Museum) to study the half million artifacts and other data recovered by the Tucson Urban Renewal Archaeological Project. This historical archaeology project began in 1967 and was conducted within an 80 acre area of the oldest part of Tucson which dates to 1775. Analysis is being carried out by William Liesenbein. Two major excavations were undertaken as part of the continuing Statewide Archaeological Salvage Pro- gram (Arizona State Museum) sponsored by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Robert M. Herskovitz directed the excavation of a transitional Santa Cruz-Sacaton phase Hohokam village south of Tempe. A number of pithouses and cremations were uncovered. Of primary importance was the location of a series of small irrigation canals which formed a spider-web network system from several major canals. From April through August 1974, David E. Doyel supervised the excavation of eight small Salado sites near Miami. Approximately 20 rock-walled structures and pithouses plus numerous extra-mural features were cleared. The Archaeological Division of the Arizona State Museum recently established the Cultural Resource Management Section for carrying out contract work. Mark Grady directs the Section. Recent Section projects include the partial excavation of the Tubac Presidio south of Tucson, test excavations for the Soil Conservation Service in Hohokam-Salado sites near Gila Buttes, excavation of a limited activity site on Indian Bend Wash in the Phoenix vicinity, and preparation of archaeological overviews on a number of Bureau of Land Management Planning Units in the state. Current fieldwork includes continued survey of the Buttes Reservoir area for the Bureau of Reclama- tion. Excavations were conducted by Vance Haynes and Emil Haury (University of Arizona) and Larry Agen- broad (Chadron State), at the Lehner Clovis site in May and June of 1974 in order to test for Clovis activity areas adjacent to the mammoth kill site excavations of 1955-56. Butchering and/or game processing areas found along the south bank of Mammoth Kill Creek included a large roasting pit and associated tools and resharpening flakes. In addition, evidence of an early Cochise occupation was dis- covered 5-10 cm above the Clovis occupational floor. Excavations will continue in 1975 under the sponsor- ship of the National Geographic Society. John Clonts, Doug Brown and the Papago Indian Archeological Team (Arizona Archeological Center, National Park Service) worked for the past year on the Papago Indian Reservation. Brown and the archaeolog- ical team tested four sites along Papago Indian Route #1 and partially excavated six others. Nine additional sites along the same route near the U.S.-Mexican border are scheduled for work in 1975 and will provide a large sample of a little-known section of Arizona. Fieldwork included excavation of a pithouse village near Hickiwan where both inhumations and cremations were found. Laboratory analysis of the Papago Project material has been initiated by E. Jane Rosenthal. A survey and archaeological clearance program for four Indian reservations in Arizona was developed by the BIA with assistance from John Clonts (National Park Service). The program provided archaeological input for developments on the Papago, Salt River, Gila, and Fort McDowell Indian reservations. RICHARD G. VIVIAN 497</page></plain_text>
