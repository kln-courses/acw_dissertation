Because multiplicity is never in the terms, however many, nor in all the terms together, the whole. Multiplicity is precisely in the "and, " which is different in nature from elementary components and collections of them.... AND is neither one thing nor the other, it's always in-between, between two things; it's the borderline, there's always a border, a line offlight or flow, only we don't see it, because it's the least perceptible of things. And yet it's along this line of flight that things come to pass, becomings evolve, revolutions take shape.' -Gilles Deleuze, "Three Questions on Six Times Two" In 1920, when the Parisian Dadaists asked Francis Picabia to design a stage set for one of their "'manifestations," Picabia responded by cre ating a "transparent" set, an accumulation of ropes, placards, and suspended objects set up in front of the stage instead of behind it. And in 1924, when Picabia was invited to create a full-scale ballet that he entitled Relache (Performance Canceled), the artist designed a notorious set of some 370 spotlights which were now placed behind the stage instead of above or before it. Gazing at the space of the stage, spectators were forced to stare headlong into an immense wall of light that would burst periodically into full illu mination, like so many car headlights or camera flashes, in time with the changes in volume of the ballet's musical score. Through such precise reversals or inversions of theatrical conventions, Picabia highlighted the space of the auditorium over the stage, the audience over the spectacle, an audience whose response was to be an intrinsic part of both Dada manifestation and avant-garde ballet. But to what effect? In a book composed in the 1970s on the history of modern sculp ture, Rosalind Krauss looks back at the set for Relache as a key pre cursor of then-current sculptural concerns. As opposed to other modernist light-sculptures such as Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's Light Prop for a Ballet (or Light-Space Modulator), 1923-1930, which Krauss sees as merely a kind of anthropomorphic or robotic "actor," a "technological contribution to the conventional sense of dramatic space and time," the set for Relache was "involved in a movement to radicalize the relationship between theater and its audience." For, in an unexpected and even gratuitous fashion, rupturing the cause Grey Room 25, Fall 2006, pp. 92-125. ? 2006 George Baker 93</page><page sequence="3">and effect logic of narrative and its rationalist basis, "Relache strikes out at the audience directly-absorbing it, focusing on it-by lighting it. So the audience is blinded even while it is illuminated, and that double function demonstrates that once the watcher is physically incorporated into the spectacle, his dazzled vision is no longer capable of supervising its events."2 Absorption, incorporation-the metaphors of Krauss's descrip tion speak as well to the situation created some fifty years after Picabia's set by the first of Anthony McCall's "solid light" films, Line Describing a Cone, 1973. McCall's inversion of cinematic con ventions was slightly different than Picabia's inversion of the hier archy of theater audience and stage, although both would prioritize light and its effects. Asking his viewers, like the prisoners in Plato's canonical Parable of the Cave, to turn away from the scene of rep resentation, McCall proposed that the audience for his film should face the projection apparatus directly, gazing into a source of light and attending to the light beam cast into space by the apparatus. Presaged by performances close in spirit to happenings that the artist often produced to be filmed, and by sculptural experiments with "solid light" that involved the partial masking and thus manipulation of sources of daylight in given architectural spaces, Line Describing a Cone began with a single beam or point of light. Over the course of thirty minutes, this beam slowly and inexorably developed into a circular shape, ultimately "describing" a hollow cone of light that pierced the darkened space of its exhibition or projection. As if this turn away from the scene of representation was a simple rationalist move, a true analog to the Platonic parable, McCall described his intentions in words characteristic of the still-residual modernism of the time. "Line Describing a Cone is what I term a solid light film," McCall asserted. He then announced a hostility to representational or narrative content that had been endemic to visual modernism for almost a century: "It is dealing with the pro jected light beam itself, rather than treating the light-beam as a mere carrier of coded information, which is decoded when it strikes a flat surface (the screen)."3 To face the source of the projected light of film, to turn all of one's attention to the projection apparatus itself, was seemingly to disallow one's mastering by the cinematic specta cle; it was to face the medium as a material that could be perceived directly and thus understood. McCall continued: Line Describing a Cone deals with one of the irreducible, nec essary conditions of film: projected light. It deals with this phenomenon directly, independent of any other consideration. It is the first film to exist solely in real, three-dimensional, space. 94 Grey Room 2.9</page><page sequence="4">This film exists only in the present: the moment of projection. It refers to nothing beyond this real time. (In contrast, most films allude to a past time.) It contains no illusion.4 Echoing one of the key ambitions of minimalism, put in place defin itively by the Jewish Museum's "Primary Structures" exhibition in 1966, McCall concluded: "It is a primary experience, not secondary: i.e., the space is real, not referential; the time is real, not referential."5 We seem far with this statement from the "absorption" and "incorporation" attributed by Krauss to Picabia's Reldche, far from a spectacle that cannot be "supervised" in an a priori or rationalist fashion, and yet there are paradoxes writhing, in fact, beneath the smooth surface and confidence of McCall's explanatory words. We may doubt, for instance, that any film could escape the condition of the medium's dedication to the production of "illusion," no matter how directly it might analyze the conditions of this illusion's pro duction (the raison d'etre of the so-called flicker film, and one of the interests of the series of works that McCall created in the wake of Line Describing a Cone). To gaze at the film's cone of light devel oping and being shaped still depends, of course, on the persistence of vision, on our inability to perceive the individual still frames consisting here of the line animation of a white circle growing slowly on a black ground-as anything but the illusion of continu ity and unimpeded flow. In a further paradox, while the purpose of McCall's turn away from the cinematic scene of representation may be to rupture traditional cinema's dependence on narrative or extra filmic conventions, narrative is of course still foregrounded here. The work's title makes this inescapable, with its play on the word "describing," as if McCall recognized film's inability in its tempo ral extension to divorce itself of a narrative dimension: Line Describing a Cone.6 We watch as a line of light grows into a curved plane, and then a semicircle, and then a full, conical form. There is, as one critic put it, an almost "structurally conventional" narrative development, and one wonders if the form "described" by McCall's film, poised like a living object in the projection space, is not indeed another anthropomorphic type of "actor," a conventional analog for the centered and unified human body as well as a "tech nological contribution to a conventional sense of dramatic space and time."7 While the full series of solid light films that would descend from Line Describing a Cone seem in one sense dedicated to confronting and frustrating any remnants of this conventional reading the work of analytic decomposition elaborated by the later "cone films" (Partial Cone, Conical Solid, and Cone of Variable Volume), or the dispersed form of Long Film for Four Projectors and its own Bake | tlmBeynd ts Ltnmts 95</page><page sequence="5">progeny-the full range of paradox presented by McCall's first "abstract" film has not yet been confronted. For if, on the one hand, a simple "narrative" progression was involved, that transformation did not evolve and could not be received in a unified or uniform manner. "No longer," as McCall stressed about his film, is one viewing position as good as any other. For this film, every viewing position presents a different aspect. The viewer, therefore, has a participatory role in apprehending the event: he or she can, indeed needs to, move around, relative to the emerging light form. This is radically different from the tradi tional film situation . .. [where] the viewer sits passively in one position ... [and] can only participate vicariously.8 And if, in one sense, the film medium was here subjected to an analytic strategy of potentially rationalist implication, the result was indeed, on the level of spectatorship, less a move of critical distanciation than one that produced a new field of both the "absorption" and "incorporation" described by Krauss.9 For, as the spectators of Line Describing a Cone moved in an aleatory fashion in relation to the slowly emerging film form and to the other members of the audience-"developing" in this way in a fashion as marked as, and yet much more random than, the filmic transformation of line into cone-they would be "lit" by the film just as they could examine its productive apparatus, they could interact with and be both illuminated and blinded by its light form in a myriad of ways. In a counterintuitive manner, unlike the metaphoric entrance promised by so much traditional narrative cinema, spectators of Line Describing a Cone could enter literally "into" the film; one could walk inside or "touch" its cone; indeed, one ramification of its transformed projection scenario was that in every moment of its apperception, one was somehow newly "in" or a part of the film. True to an analytic strategy that broached no separation-that was in fact dedicated paradoxically both to anti-illusionism and to a new "realized" form of immersion or continuity-this is a con fusing situation to describe. Our task is made that much more dif ficult by the most important of the "incorporative" or "absorptive" moves that Line Describing a Cone makes. This is a move that, while not stressed by Krauss, was also central to the strategies of the Dada moment, and to Picabia's Relache. Throbbing in time to the ballet's music, the lights of the Relache set were made thus to communicate with another medium or form, just as they insinuated-in their repetitive "flashing" and concomitant freezing of the balletic move ment itself-a metaphorically photographic dimension to the theatrical spectacle. Sculpture touches music and photography and dance, and in Rehiche the communication of mediums did not stop here. For the reversed theatrical scenario proposed by the set, its 96 Grev Room 2</page><page sequence="6">inverted projection onto the audience during the course of the dance, would be answered by an actual cinematic projection, the film Entr'acte by Picabia and Rene Clair that was pro jected onto the stage as the ballet's intermission, a moment when the stage is usually unoccupied, when the audience's activity is usually priori tized.10 This movement of reversal and inversion, a concerted communi cation of disparate mediums around a palpable limit or threshold, is pre cisely the strategy resurrected by McCall's invention of the "solid light" film. For the most striking paradox of McCall's Line Describing a Cone is that in its extreme analytic work upon the medium and the materials of film, the medium achieves a real (as opposed to represented) spatial dimension; film in fact accedes to the condition of sculpture. "It is as though," the critic Scott MacDonald noted to McCall, Anthony McCall. "filmmaking had led you out of film.""

Photograph the wake of minimalism, ranging from painting to music to dance. by Peter Moore cO The Estate A commonplace now of critical understanding, minimalism repre- of Peter Moore/VAGA, NYC. sents the moment when the various modernist mediums achieved both the apotheosis of their work of self-definition, as Clement Greenberg would have put it, and in this extreme self-objectifica tion reached a limit where they fell as objects into the world.12 Painting, for example, in delimiting as never before its material flat ness as a field, would court the condition of becoming merely a lit eral flat object, an object that an artist like Donald Judd would begin to call a "specific object," somehow positioned at or beyond a limit such that it was now "neither painting nor sculpture." In fact, an artist close to Judd such as Dan Flavin provides the closest parallel or immediate predecessor to McCall's desire to solidify and to work with light, to push the medium of film into a sculptural dimension. But Flavin, of course, took the path diametrically opposed to McCall's work upon film, using light instead to "de-solidify" and thus com plicate that which constitutes the object form and experience of sculpture, to "dematerialize" the most material or solid of medi ums-to use a slightly misleading term in use at the time. Flavin's light sculptures, too, of course, posed a crossing of mediums; while Baker Film Beyond Its Limits 97</page><page sequence="7">their potentially cinematic dimension has hardly ever elicited com ment or has not even been seen (but which perhaps McCall allows us to see anew), their play with color and light betrayed such works' allegiance more to a reflection upon the transformation of the medium of painting, to their new suspension between illusion and a real three-dimensional object, between, in fact, painting and sculpture."3 In a paradox that brings us back to McCall, the crucial point however is this: in this "suspension" between mediums (understood by many minimalists as an escape from the medium altogether) a new form of "continuity" was again devised. In Flavin, this took the form of the light sculpture's inherent suturing-through the incorporative play of light-of the individual art object to its surrounding space, a suturing that ultimately would include as well the spectator's body in its all-encompassing embrace. We know now that it was this new experience of continuity that was everywhere radicalized by the artistic strategies that have since come to be known simply as "postminimalism," and it is to this artistic formation, I believe, that McCall's films must be related. This "continuity" has been understood, to date, in terms limited to the phenomenological concerns introduced by the minimalist artists themselves. That is, if one of the implications of the mini malist literalization of aesthetic form was the emptying out of all internal formal play within the art object, a voiding of its "substan tive" being, then that art object's "relational" existence would now become all-important. It would be the art object's relation to the space of its exhibition that would become of marked value, as well as the spectator's changing phenomenological apperception of the object in and through both space and time. It was a short step from such an understanding of art's vocation-stressing not internal and autonomous being but rather relational interdependence-to pro claim that the phenomenological and durational horizon of per ception in itself was in some form the new modality of artistic practice, an understanding that would not allow art to be artificially constrained into a self-enclosed object form. From such an under standing would stem the radical procedural strategies of the process art of Eva Hesse or Richard Serra, as much as the environmental experiments, performances, and films of both Bruce Nauman and Dan Graham, where the practice of art was first aligned with a series of transitive actions upon artistic materials and then opened up to transitive action in the world directly. Such was the radical "conti nuity" of space and time broached by postminimal art, one that would suffer no conception of art limited to the production of isolated, self-contained objects. Yet it has been overlooked how once again the postminimal interpenetration of art and spectator was articulated in relation to, and perhaps depended upon, a new interpenetration of artistic 98 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="8">mediums or forms. For, as opposed to the marked "de-specification" of art embraced by some forms of Conceptual art-Conceptual art's investigation of the condition of what Joseph Kosuth called "art-in general" (although our understanding even of this investigation needs to be complicated)-the strategies of postminimalism expanded rather than voided what we might understand an artistic medium to be, "freeing," we could say, a medium's specificity from the for mer constraints of its materials or object-forms, allowing that speci ficity to act upon the world in new ways.14 At its most challenging moments, the postminimal quest for spectatorial continuity opened up a quest for a radical continuity of forms, which we might call a transgressive model of medium-belonging that sought to take medi ums to the limits where they began to touch and shape other forms, but only by "othering" themselves in the process.15 Everywhere we look in McCall's early projects we see a similar desire to open radically the object of art to a phenomenological and durational experience, one that would however in the process artic ulate the interpenetration of the remnants or concerns of individ ual mediums and forms. There would be slide projections such as Slit Scan or Miniature in Black and White, 1972, that would play with the temporal concerns of film as well as the film medium's dependence on the persistence of vision in an entirely other medium and apparatus. There would be seemingly static photographic works such as Water Table, a series of six images of a table in a sunlit room that cataloged a concerted and progressive interaction of dis parate forms. Dribbled with water, the table was also covered with wooden elements whose linearity and repetition was reminiscent of the "primary" forms of minimal sculpture, arranged in a random manner however close to the concerns of process art and "distrib ution" sculpture (i.e., Carl Andre's "scatter" works). As the photo graphic series progressed, these linear elements were gradually removed from the scene, allowing the sunlight in the space to reflect more directly off the spilled water, ultimately dematerializing the very solidity of the table through the mirror play and incorporative sheen of light. While holding various forms and elements some what awkwardly together-the linearity of drawing, the modular ity of sculpture, the documentary inscription of photography, the sequencing of a narrative form or of film-Water Table ultimately both exhibits and thematizes "continuity" in its dematerialization of matter through light (the work's title is an obvious pun, literaliz ing the term used for the level of "flowing" water beneath "solid" ground, and the work itself belongs to a larger interest on McCall's part in using elemental materials-fire, water, light-that explicitly exceed the boundaries of clearly delineated forms). And, in McCall's early development, there would also be envi ronmental and performative works made to be filmed, such as Bkr l Beyond lts Limd+S 99</page><page sequence="9">Landscape for White Squares, where the performers' marching of squares of canvas material into real space could only call up the material substrate of painting as well as the material manipulations of sculpture, while the arrangement of the performers' bodies and their canvas squares in space articulated in a startling way the lin ear arrangement of film frames following one upon the other, as if the material of film had been translated into a newly sculptural or spatial form in literal and extreme interdependence with and upon the human body. 16 By 1973, however, McCall's invention of the solid light film brought the interaction of disparate mediums to a place they had never before been, inventing a more precise form of what we might call "filmic sculpture." At the limit of the articulation of the mate rials of film, McCall would locate specific points of connection of the film form to an entirely other medium. "The specific idea that I was working on was that the projector's light beam was not only visible, but physical and space-occupying," McCall recalled, "and it could be shaped, both in space and in time, using film as the medium.'17 To name McCall's cone films and their progeny "filmic sculpture" is to put such work in explicit dialogue with the type of artistic project emerging from postminimalism that has been given the linked but reversed name "sculptural film." The term is the 100 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="10">0 critic Benjamin Buchloh's. It is a term that attempts to account for the generation of postminimalist sculptors in the late 1960s and early 1970s who found themselves ineluctably attracted to work within film, as if the concerns of sculpture could only be articulated now in this entirely other medium. In an early essay on Richard Serra's films, Buchloh is at pains to describe the precise manner in which sculpture and film come to be co-articulated in Serra's pro ject. "What distinguishes Serra's films," Buchloh writes, "is that, in arriving at a new definition of plastic phenomena through the nec essary use of film, they demonstrate their own necessity as films."'8 Immediately, it seems as if the interplay of sculpture and film at the moment of postminimalism would not lead to a simple fusion of disparate forms; something essential to the logic of each medium was being discovered through breaking the modernist taboos around medium specificity, through exposing each form to the other. For Buchloh, the initiation of "sculptural film" in the late 1960s has nothing to do with the ghost of the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk haunting all of modernism and twentieth-century artistic culture; this is rather an ambition that (inaccurately) Buchloh ascribes to the artistic formation of John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Robert Rauschenberg; instead, "the new forms were based on an awareness of the objective correspondences between the investigations in the plastic and the temporal arts."'"9 In order to clarify what these correspondences might be, Buchloh traces in meticulous detail the manner in which process sculpture came to break down the false separation of the artistic object, a development in which postminimal sculpture comes to understand its operations as opening onto a "continuum" of spatial exploration (hardly separated, that is, in terms of object and architecture, or of architecture and observer). Through sculpture's discovery of its operation in a spatial continuum would come its new awareness that such a continuum necessitates thinking of the sculptural oper ation in duration as well, for any thought of a spatial continuum is Opposite: Anthony McCall.

"If the temporal field," Buchloh explains, "as a mode of experience is linked in this way with the spatial field of perception,' then "the technical formal necessity of the step from process sculpture to sculptural film becomes evident, since the per ception of a spatial-temporal field is the very mode of film."2" Buchloh's point is that the new awareness of the durational field of sculptural activity led to a realization of an "objective correspon dence" between sculpture and film, a linkage that had never been articulated before. Suddenly, to begin to work in film could be claimed, logically and formally, to be a clear extension of the radical sculptural principles discovered in the late 1960s. But more, Richard Serra. Frames from Buchloh's point is that an awareness of this new correspondence of Hand Catching Lead, 1968. sculpture and film produced the most radical and consequent work 16mm film. of that moment. "[S]culptural reflection reaches its most advanced position precisely at the point where sculpture as a concrete phe nomenon is transcended and transformed into sculptural film," Buchloh concluded, pointing to works such as Serra's early films Hand Catching Lead or Hands Scraping. "No longer sculpture or film, these works induce the viewer to perceive active physiologi cal and psychological identity in more modes than the traditions of these two categories permit."'21 Buchloh's last sentence above is an extraordinary statement; its implications need unpacking. We need to know what the new per ception of "physiological and psychological identity" might mean for artistic experience; we need to question why suddenly Buchloh retreats from his own term sculptural film to lapse into a formula reminiscent of Judd, calling the new work "no longer sculpture or film." We seem to be attending to a description of the birth of a new, as yet properly unnamable form (or "strategy," or, perhaps better, "practice"). Ironically, however, it would be Richard Serra himself who would later question Buchloh's use of the term "sculptural film" in a well-known interview with film historian Annette Michelson: As soon as the term "sculptural film" comes up, I get very con fused about what I understand sculpture to be and what I understand film to be. When someone uses a slow dolly with a camera, or progressively moves into a foreshortened space, it still seems to me that you are dealing with an illusion on a flat plane which you can't enter into. The way it is understood denies the progressive movement of your body in time. It's from a fixed viewpoint. It takes into consideration the very flatness of the screen. I've always thought that the basic assumptions of film could never be sculptural in any way, and to beg the analogy between what is assumed to be sculptural in sculpture and what is assumed to be sculptural in film is 102 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="12">not really to understand the potential of what sculpture is and always has been. I have always thought it was a bit journalese to discuss it that way. That is not to say that you can't talk about languages people share, languages in different material manifestations. But to say that an experience of sculpture can be similar to or influenced by the illusion in film-I've always thought that was nonsense.22 We might wonder in the face of these words whether or not we are witnessing a sculptor in full retreat from the radical implications opened up by an earlier, now rejected body of work. More likely, however, critic and artist simply misunderstand one another here in a manner where their concerns come to communicate without their knowing it. For later in the same interview, Serra explains that his reason for making films was to distinguish sculpture from film even more radically, in fact to use the parameters of one medium to launch a critique of the other. That this work of "distinction" might not oppose but in fact could simultaneously produce a more true form of "correspondence" between two mediums hardly occurs to Serra. Speaking of his film Frame, where spatial measurement is deployed to underline the spatial illusions produced in represen tational films, Serra explains: I think that what the film points out is that there is a basic flat illusion of film, there isn't any real space. And I think that probably my need to demonstrate that was the need to make the distinction from sculpture even clearer to me. At the time I probably didn't realize it, but it has since seemed to be one of the reasons for doing the film.23 It was perhaps not Anthony McCall's primary intention to use film to critique the medium of sculpture. It is a fact, however, that the new collision of these forms in McCall's project articulates a set of sculptural concerns in ways that radicalize (another under standing of "critique") the traditional practice of that medium. It is interesting as well to note that the pathway followed by both Serra and Buchloh-from sculpture into film-was also reversed in McCall's project. In other words, while the transition from the fixed object-form of sculpture to the immaterial flux of film was seen as a kind of teleological progression in the visual arts, McCall's move ment from film back into sculpture proposes that the process is less a teleology than a porous limit, a boundary that can be crossed in myriad ways. Methodologically, we seem then to face not a dialec tical historical development, as the art historian might have us believe, but a moment in history when "development" was precisely thrown into question, when the expansion of forms rather began to circulate around a limit and its transgression. For transgression, as Bake | Fm Beond rn tts 1 03</page><page sequence="13">understood by twentieth-century thinkers from Georges Bataille to Michel Foucault, follows no set direction or pathway, but rather takes both thought and form into pathways that are inherently mul tiple and disorienting, that disorient in fact by the ways in which they allow multiplicity to come into being. In McCall's project, we face a radical co-articulation of film and sculpture, as Gilles Deleuze might have put it, rather than a dialectical development leading from sculpture into film. The transgressive movement between film and sculpture, with neither form given priority over the other, finds its precise echo in the diverse formal strategies that McCall would begin to employ, strategies that indeed show that "distinguishing" these mediums would only highlight their "correspondence" more directly. At times, in the cone works, film would be the medium used to articulate a sculptural and physical-or at least space-occupying-form, and yet at other times undeniable sculptural principles would equally come to modulate the films. At first seeming to break with the intense logic of development or "becoming" inherent in the action of Line Describing a Cone, McCall's subsequent (and shorter) cone films took up the original form in parts, and shifted the first film's self evident "becoming" into other, less obvious domains. For McCall, though, "becoming" was still the issue; each cone film to follow Line Describing a Cone "systematically develops a scale along which a form becomes or ceases to become a 'solid."'24 The "becom ing" at stake in the subsequent cone films, then, seems less about the transition between line and cone, or between two- and three dimensions, than between film and sculpture themselves as forms and as mediums, the becoming "solid" of light.25 In Partial Cone, 1974, a half-circle of light is put through three different types of formal modulation. These modulations are caused 1 04 Grey Ro 25</page><page sequence="14">C tt~~~~~~-aY n0&lt; (I . ~rJ' ) m - m m . - - m - m - m m ----XX------ -X- -- XX---""" - - - - - - - - mmmm mmmm - - - - - - mm - ------- - - - -- - -- - -- - m - -- m l - --iim mn mmmm NUKEN N.

In a first modulation, the frames are presented in units orga nized around matching pairs: one frame of a half-circle followed by one blank frame, two frames of the half-circle followed by two blank frames, and so on. In a second variation, the fully solid pro jection of the half-circle "dominates" the inserted blank frames at first; McCall proceeds to insert one blank frame every twenty-four frames, then in units composed of decreasing gaps (1 every 12, 1 every 8, 1 every 4, etc.). The last variation reverses this progression, allowing the blank frames to dominate, into which one frame of the half-circle is inserted in units of now steadily increasing intervals. The flicker effect achieved in each variation passes through and beyond the human capacity to register the perceptual change of the frames flying by at twenty-four frames per second; in McCall's words, a threshold moment is quickly reached in which "at certain points the solid ceases to appear as such as its fabric increasingly assumes the quality of pure, agitated light," or, of course, vice versa.26 It is crucial to note, however, that while McCall's Partial Cone explores film illusion again in ways that connect the work to the genre of the flicker film, his manner of modulating the film form takes its structural principle-modularity and permutation-from formal procedures that seem closest to those of minimal sculpture. With the obsessiveness and compulsion of a Sol LeWitt progression of modular cubes, McCall exhausts the structural permutations of his patterns of film frames, treating and ordering the individual unit of the frame, in fact, in a manner absolutely parallel to the manner in which industrial materials were deployed in minimalist sculptural form. Sculptural modularity here produces cinematic modulation, no matter the attempts of some film theorists to keep Opposite: Anthony McCall. Partial Cone, 1974. Film frame. Above: Anthony McCall.

Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 105</page><page sequence="15">these domains separate, to claim modulation as the sole and proper domain of film.27 And, equally as important, the threshold reached by Partial Cone lies not just at the limits of cinematic perception but at its sculptural apperception as well. If the variation of the flicker effect pushes the form in and out of "solidity," and thus in and out of the sculptural field altogether, the viewer's bodily move ment around the now partial form radically alters its perceptibility too. For, from the exterior side of the half-circle, the curvature and three-dimensionality of the form is easily apparent; and yet, made of light, from the other side this three-dimensionality simply can not be spatially perceived, as the form collapses into an illusion of a seemingly two-dimensional plane. Crucially, now, just as a sculp tural procedure had produced cinematic effects, it is a cinematic property and its limits, the projection of light and the creation of illusion, which produce sculptural volume and depth or its perceived lack. If Partial Cone collapsed from certain angles into an illusion of flatness and was at times only able to be perceived as a plane, McCall's Conical Solid, 1974, was made only of linear or planar ele ments. And yet it, too, "carries within itself a perceptual thresh old," as McCall put it, where a plane of light rotating like the second hand of a clock attempts to describe a conical form.28 Broken down at first into the positions possible in a rotation that takes only four frames of film, the viewer perceives an "X" of light made up of the four planar positions, more or less constant due once more to the persistence of vision. Expanding the positions traced by this plane into those allowed in a 6-frame rotation, an 8-frame rotation, and then a 12-, 16-, 24-, 48-, and 120-frame rotation, McCall slowly allows the plane of light to be seen describing a newly solidified conical form. The movement of Conical Solid becomes one of per petual rotation, a repetitive and obsessive circling like the endless ticking of a clock. This rotation occurs, however, in a counter clockwise direction in real space, and indeed the rotation progres sively slows in speed, as if time itself was being "thickened," or metaphorically run backward-which is more of a spatial as opposed to a temporal experience and possibility. And yet slowed in this way, it is also as if time in Conical Solid has now been solid ified into space, as the "solid" traced in this film does not take the form of a cone of light but can only be perceived in negative by the temporal slowing of the planar rotation itself. Cinematic time, that is, becomes transformed at a certain limit into sculptural space, in the same manner as light can be said to become solid. Conical Solid departs from the other cone films in its interdic tion, however, of spatial incorporation. While the viewer can surely enter "into" the field of light of this film, the planar movement within the cone form now seems to "push" the viewer out of the 1 06 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="16">CONICAL SOLID Anthony McCall March 1974 16m silent 24fps One second from each of the eight parts: Z 2 ) 5 64- 7 1.

McCall, of course, was testing limits, of both perception and of mediums; both the outside and inside of these limits would be explored. The last of the cone films, Cone of Variable Volume, returns to the "hollowness" of the cone form and articulates this volume in a concerted way. By moving his camera up and down above a solid white circle filmed on an animation stand, McCall was able to play with a range of movement in which the size of the cone now seems to expand and contract in space. Starting with an almost imperceptible slowness, the movement in and out of the cone gradually increases in speed, accelerating in four perceptible stages. While from the exterior of the pulsating cone form, the movement of the film does seem to "push" the viewer spatially just as vehemently as Conical Solid, the hollowness of the cone ultimately Anthony McCall.

While comparisons with the ur-image of Western human ism may seem apropos-Leonardo's Vitruvian man, per fectly inscribed in the ideal geometry of the circle and the square-the endless throbbing of McCall's form undoes this apparent call to tradition. Inscribing a geometry that given over to film-will not remain constant, Cone of Variable Volume calls out for the human body-invited to move back and forth and thus in and out of the limits of the moving cone form-to submit to flux as well. And of course the predecessors of Cone of Variable Volume lie less in the Renaissance than in avant-garde experiments with film such as Marcel Duchamp's Anemic Cinema or his Rotoreliefs.29 Rather than a spatial exploration of the seamless merging of geometry and the logic of the human body, McCall's film, like Duchamp's, stages the encounter of body and film as a cinematic experience of both dizzy ing excess and inescapable sexuality. This had always been at least a horizon of McCall's early performance works, where happenings that seemed to deploy the most stable of geometries, like the grid forms of his Landscape for Fire performances, were played off against the aleatory if not utterly orgiastic principle of movement underlying the progression of a happening like Circulation Figures, 1972. In the latter work, a large group of filmmakers and photogra phers were invited to bring their cameras to a space surrounded by mirrors, in order to move about and film both the space and each other with a cinematographic promiscuity that would put more mainstream films like Antonioni's Blow Up to shame.30 We are not used to a sculptural space "varying" in volume at 108 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="18">41 every moment of its apperception. The last of McCall's cone films highlights then the strangeness of the filmic articulation of sculp tural form, a form that will occupy space and with which we can interact, but will never remain stable, fluctuating as pointedly as the spectatorial body itself. Consequently, Cone of Variable Volume seems to throw off a dizzying series of experiential analogies, shift ing in character over time in ways that are similarly unstable. If, here, McCall was testing the "incorporative" logic of his new film forms, that dynamic of incorporation became vehemently corporal. The cone film, always like an "actor" in its exhibition space, now became more explicitly "like" a body, seeming, at the slowest pace of its expansion and contraction, to "breathe" in a rhythm that roughly matched the human body's own. As the variation sped up, however, the Bolero-like inevitability of its acceleration brought to mind quite different corporal rhythms, producing a sexual inten sity that, as Derrida might put it, "invaginated" the spectator in a manner whose effect seemed to want to assert the undeniable phys icality of the process of cinematic incorporation itself. On the one hand, we might read Cone of Variable Volume as proposing that the cinematic modulation of sculpture, the crossing of the limit between these two forms, is a transgression operating in a manner as radical as that in which we can experience the intermingling and sharing of separate bodies; on the other hand, the work's chiastic exploration of a sculptural embodiment of film proposes in fact a sexualization of the logic of cinematic incorporation that creates an entirely new sociality and politics of and for film. It has long been mentioned that McCall's solid light films contained of course an "implicit politic"-namely, the "idea of using film to communitize the film audience."'31 At a moment when the world's increasingly total mediation through the illusory powers of film and the image in general was being denounced by tracts such as Guy Debord's The Opposite, top: Anthony McCall.

Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 109</page><page sequence="19">Society of the Spectacle, the false commu nity of spectacle was here countered by the real, physical incorporation of the spectator posed by McCall's films. Cinema, in other words, had always been involved in a kind of false captation of the social body; McCall countered this capture not by simply dissecting the logic of cinematic identification and incorporation-by countering puritanically the false plea sures of cinematic illusion-but by collec tivizing the process, by sexualizing it, by making it excessive, physical, and quite literally real. And, in a crucial counterde velopment, the incorporation of the spectator by the film now effects the film form in turn, which begins to "share" the charac teristics of the body just as it reaches out to engulf it, becoming in some sense a corporal form as well. We thus arrive at the logic of the last development of McCall's solid light films, the invention of what the artist began to call the "long" film, first posed in Long Film for Four Projectors, 1974. Such a "film" would literally be "long" in a manner that was obviously temporal; relying on a logic of permutation that had once more both sculptural and cinematic relevance, McCall's piece used four forty minute reels of film that were shown on four projectors set up in the four corners of a room, pointing inward. Rotated so that the film was fed through each projector in the four potential ways-forward, backward, inside out, and right way around-the film became now more properly an event that lasted some six hours in total.32 But if a spatial manipulation of the film reel created such temporal elonga tion, this was a film that also became "long" spatially and sculp 110 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="20">FOUR PROJECTED MOVEMENTS 16m film Anthony McCall 1975 The Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens, London W2.

One cycle 75 minutes. l'\ turally due to its transformed projection scenario, breaking up as it did the volumetric unity of the individual cone films. "Spatially, this film is very different from the four Cone films," McCall has written. "Each of these presents a single volumetric object that occupies the center of a surrounding space. In Long Film, there is a field created by the film. It surrounds the visitor. As long as you are in the room, you are within the film."33 Crucially, while McCall makes the logical step from the physical incorporation of the cone films to a newly all-encompassing cinematic and spatial field, the invention of this "field" depended in Long Film for Four Projectors on McCall's abandonment of the conical form of his earlier films. If this conical form had allowed for a literal spatial incorporation of the spectator, Long Film radicalized this incorporation by taking up instead the planar form used only thus far in Conical Solid. And if there the planar form had "blocked" the incorporative destiny of the other cone films, in Long Film it was precisely the intersection and crossing of the barrier of multiple planar forms that allowed for the dissolution of cone into spatial field. In Long Film for Four Projectors, the lessons of the form of the plane-its physical embod iment of a barrier or a limit-and the incorporative form of the cone came together in that paradoxical wedding of distance and conti nuity which since the outset of McCall's work seems to have been his formal (and political) goal. The planar forms deployed in Long Film would call up their own analogs, as had the cone; in a one-hour distillation of the principles of the longer projection that McCall entitled Four Projected Movements, 1975, the film plane deployed in space was forced to coincide with the planar articulation of space itself, by which I mean to highlight the coincidence of this film form with the artic ulation, not of sculpture, but of architecture. Like all of McCall's titles, Four Projected Movements was multivalent in the extreme, indeed as multiple in its connotations as its planar form was in its medium-belonging.

Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 111</page><page sequence="21">slowly in a ninety-degree rotation, the film was again pushed through the projector in the four possible permutations. It thus had four "movements," like a musical composition (each fifteen min utes long); and its "movements" were not only projected but also forced again upon the spectator's body, aligning its scenario perhaps with a spatial and temporal form such as dance. "Projected" here also takes on an ambivalent existence, as these movements literally depend upon projection for their substance, but are also "projected" in the sense of anticipated bodily on the part of the spectator. Aligning the projector with one wall of the architectural container in which the film is shown, McCall assured that this filmic plane would coincide-literally-with an architec tural one. Flipped in its various ways, the rotating plane would push out from the wall toward the floor or from the ceiling toward a wall. "Instead of existing in an open empty space," McCall clarified, Four Projected Movements "was presented against a wall, so that the plane of light was always experienced in relation to the wall or the floor: it 'pushed' people against the wall, away from the wall, down onto the floor."34 This is a startling assertion when read in terms of McCall's pre vious work. We have become habituated, perhaps, to the cone films' "freeing" of the spectator's body; unfettered from the prison of what has been called cinema's "Institutional Mode of Representation," the cone films opened up a potential infinity of spectatorial inter action.35 This "freedom" however, perhaps relied on a crossing of the limits of cinema with the medium of sculpture, an embodiment that pushed the two mediums toward an opening up of limits them selves. Looking now to the institutional emplacement of architec ture, film would seem to engage instead with a situation of marked spectatorial "control," as if the crossing of film into architecture produced not an opening of limits but a new awareness and rigid assertion of the limit itself. While pushing the spectator's interac tion with the field and the form of film to a new extreme, Four Projected Movements becomes, however, rather unlike the other solid light films. In its solidity it seems to take on what Michel Foucault would call a "disciplinary" dimension, as if film had been infected by its crossing of the limits of architecture, only to allow us to feel in an achingly corporeal way the limiting core of archi tecture itself. This double movement, of course, is what I have been trying to explore throughout this essay. As film takes on the shape and para meters of architecture only to display the limitations of the form it has inhabited, we understand anew what it means for a form to transgress the limits of its form, to "correspond" to the limits of another. But we must consider as well that this "disciplinary" film would be, more or less, the last of McCall's solid light films for 1 12 Gr4y Room 25</page><page sequence="22">some twenty-five years. A form had been invented only to be almost as quickly abandoned. Two years of life seems tremendously, even painfully, short. It was as if McCall's concerted crossing of aesthetic limits had run its course, if not exhausted its potential permutations. But more, it was as if crossing such aesthetic limits was suddenly seen as potentially inadequate as an avant-garde strategy, if not compensatory to other limits, politi cal and social limits, that could not be crossed at all. In one of the most impor tant accounts of the aspirations and place of avant-garde film in our culture, Annette Michelson has described pre cisely what we may take to have been McCall's dilemma: In our country, the questioning of the values of formal autonomy has led to an attempted dissolution of dis tinctions or barriers between media. Perhaps, however, this is because our social and economic hierarchies and distinctions remain pretty well imper vious to the radical aspiration of film makers and of artists in general. The hierarchical distinctions, the barriers between forms are, of course, infinitely more vulnerable. Cinema, on the verge of winning the battle for the recogni tion of its specificity-and every major filmmaker and critic of the last half-century has fought that battle-is now engaged in a reconsideration of its aims. The Victor now questions his Victory. The emergence of new "intermedia," the revival of the old dream of synaesthesia, the cross-fertilization of dance, theatre, and film, as in the theatre pieces of Robert Whitman . .. constitute a syndrome of that radicalism's crisis, both formal and social.36 Here, then, is a dilemma that would seem to explain McCall's sud den abandonment of the solid light film in 1975, turning thereafter to authorial collaborations and to what was called the "new talkie" a reconsideration of narrative and directly political cinematic con tent-in works like Argument, 1978, and Sigmund Freud's Dora, 1979.

Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 113</page><page sequence="23">invented film forms were not exactly "intermedia," perhaps far from a "dissolution of distinctions," surely nothing like synesthe sia. Their attention to cinema, their opening up of this form to other mediums, was much more specific and incisive than such terms imply. One might instead argue that the films' transgression of aes thetic limits, their analogical work between forms, was hardly compensatory but in fact visionary, and that this transgression was less an escape from the putative "autonomy" of cinema than a realization of a cinematic logic that both formal and political exigencies had previously thwarted. To understand this long thwarted and then short-lived "realization," we need to understand precisely what the marked cinematic abstraction of McCall's project in fact achieved. One of the most puzzling aspects of the limited reception that McCall's films have thus far received, but also one of the most consistent, lies in viewers' inability to resist "analogizing" McCall's forms to other kinds of objects and events.37 Thus, the solid light films have been compared to the man-made forms of a lighthouse or a beacon (and this by the artist himself); their play with light linked with natural forms such as the sun, an eclipse, or the glim mer of a shooting star.38 The films' use of light and geometry, then, seems constantly to tempt viewers into modes of reading that are hardly true to the forms' abstraction (a common dilemma), as if these light forms glowing in dark space can only be comprehended through categories of experience to which we have previous access: the cones are like beacons, the line describes a cone with the same slow march as an eclipse. More puzzling however are the readings of McCall's materialist project in terms of a connection to "ritual" or even to the "mythological," perhaps both subsumed by a need to read the films as opening onto a kind of "spiritual experience."39 Myth, we might say, does seem to act in an inherently analogical way, always proposing that "this is like that," always searching for the connections between things rather than imposing the rational separations required by the logic of analysis. We may want to dismiss such readings as obvious and willful projections, hardly appropriate to a project of cinematic abstrac tion. And yet the analogical force of the films does seem to match their own opening onto other mediums-their becoming sculp tural, their becoming architectural-just as it speaks to their en gulfing of our own bodies as spectators of these events. The "abstraction" of the solid light films, then, might be an extremely complicated beast to comprehend. McCall has helped us a little in this matter; he long ago provided Line Describing a Cone with a cru cial "origin" story that seems to speak to the key ambition of all of the solid light films. While made in August of 1973, Line Describing a Cone was conceived much earlier. McCall relates how the idea for 1 14 GreyRsoom 25</page><page sequence="24">the film came to him during a voyage by boat from England to America and to his new life as an artist in New York. "I conceived Line Describing a Cone in the mid-Atlantic, two and half days out of Southampton, when Carolee [Schneemann] and I moved to New York. This was January 1973. I made the film in August."40 It is a short story, true, but one repeatedly clung to and quite often told. Showing Line Describing a Cone to have been conceived while lit erally in transit, McCall's origin story is a tale about transition; it is a tale about flow, about speed, passage, and time. Conceived between two different continents, between the past and the future, McCall's film would inhabit this condition of transition, making it over into both form and content. A line would describe a cone; two dimensions would slowly shift into three; film would become sculptural; cinema would be harnessed to a project that would lit eralize change, that would make visible the inexorable, but usually imperceptible experience of becoming. In this, McCall's solid light films show that the project of cinematic abstraction as perhaps desired by modernism amounts to a quite literal impossibility. For if cinema could be said to be a medium to which the experience of "becoming" always in fact adheres, cinema could never be reduced to a stable and fixed essence. It could never be produced as mod ernist and abstract (in itself) but only as a form that would be ana logical and relational (quite literally for another). Like the transitivity isolated in Serra's process-based sculpture, McCall's light films pro claimed that it was the essence of cinema not to have an essence. Cinema could only be particularized as the movement of form into becoming, multiplicity, and difference. The basis of film form would be its undoing of a fixed basis; the "content" of its abstract transitivity the paradoxical revelation of its inherent embodiment of becoming, a movement that thus is always, logically, a becoming other. Line would be line, and it would also become cone. Light would be light, and it would also become solid. Time would be time, and it would also become space. Cinema would be cinema, and it would also become sculpture. But this is hardly all. In a dizzying magnification of the anti-essential essence of the medium, McCall's light films would then grasp that it would have to be the vocation of cinema, in its becoming other, to allow us to think and to produce the becoming other of otherforms as well. With this thought in place, we can perhaps finally understand the most radical of McCall's early works and proposals, the last of his "long" films: the installation Long Film for Ambient Light, 1975. While perhaps also the last of McCall's early abstract or solid light films altogether (in fact it is quite different from the preceding series), it should be obvious by now that this "film" was far from being an endpoint or even an endgame for the practice of film, as is often asserted.41 Consisting of no actual film or film projector and V8k im eo;ord Its Ltn ts 1 15</page><page sequence="25">thus seeming to dispense with the conventional material support of the medium, Long Film for Ambient Light followed instead a more explicitly Duchampian logic, where-as in one understand ing of Duchamp's readymade-an object extrinsic to the world of art would be pronounced to be one: "this is art."42 In McCall's pro ject, "three distinct elements combined to form the 'film,"' signifi cantly in quotes in McCall's description: a time-schema posted on a wall, a two-page written statement entitled "Notes in Duration," and an altered architectural space. With a sloping roof such that it resembled a projection apparatus or a camera, this space contained ''a single electric light hung in the center of the room at eye-level. The windows were covered with white paper, limiting them to being light-sources during the day and reflective surfaces during the night (screens)."43 What at first seems a dissolution of the phys ical medium of film into a purely nominalist gesture-a "film" made up of an architectural container, a light source, a given dura tion (in this case, the installation lasted twenty-four hours, although the included "time-schema" charted the waxing and waning of light intensity in the space over fifty days)-becomes quite obvi ously the opposite of a dissolution, but rather an expansion of "film" into entirely other forms. This expansion rests once more on a quite marked labor of analogy, as the shape of the architectural space comes to "resemble" a projector, the windows come to oper ate in turn as both "screens" or as "projectors," the lightbulb begins to recall the lamp inside the film apparatus. In a logic not so far from McCall's early films and performances such as Landscape for White Squares, the windows in the space also come in their serial ity and uniformity to call up the endless progression of film frames and blank leader, producing yet another spatial and architectural analog for the now putatively missing "medium" of film. But as the insistent presence of all of these formal analogies might suggest, the medium of film can hardly be said to be missing in Long Film for Ambient Light; it has, rather, been radically rede fined. It has been pushed as far as possible into the transgressive form of the analogical, pushed as far as possible into cinema's para doxical dedication to the loss of boundaries and separation, its con certed search for all potential forms of "continuity." Long Film for Ambient Light, indeed, makes the wild assertion that film and cin ema can be made continuous with almost all the objects in the world, by chiastically turning the world itself and its conditions into film or cinema. This double movement has long been seen as a dissolution if not a disappearance of the medium itself or of art in general; but the logic of transgression proves it to be a much more radical event than we have heretofore been able to comprehend. For, of course, working via the concretization of "film" through the play of light over time and a series of spatial or architectural analo 1 16 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="26">gies, Long Film for Ambient Light might not be accurately described as abandoning the conventional medium and materials of film at all. It is not a pure readymade or "nominalist" gesture. If in his early work, McCall jettisoned both screen and image as necessary to the definition of film, now celluloid and projector would go by the way side as well, only to find two essential components of film still very much in play: light and time. The wondrous thing about both of these components of the film medium, however, is their belonging not just to the medium of film but to the larger world itself. By which I mean to say that in Long Film for Ambient Light McCall could be said to discover that light is an essential condition of film, but it is also a condition of the world-and this film's "action" would be caused by that "ambient" light's actions itself, the action of the light of the world (the gesture is essentially Cagean, of course, Above: Anthony McCall.

Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 117</page><page sequence="27">and linked to the composer's complex notion of musical "silence"). And just as centrally, time is a condition of film, duration is its medium, but it is also a condition of the world and of every object and being within it.44 In a marked expansion rather than a reduc tivist dissolution, we have passed from the incorporative form of McCall's cone films, to the all-encompassing spatial field of the "long" film, to a film newly as "long" as the world itself, with whose conditions it is now coexistent. McCall has continually described Long Film for Ambient Light, as he did other of his solid light films, as sitting upon a "threshold": "The installation sat precisely on a threshold, on one side of which was 'time-based' art, and on the other, 'non-time-based' art." Or: "This film sits deliberately on a threshold between being consid ered a work of movement and being considered a static condi tion."45 Continuing on from the latter statement, McCall would register his protest against the categorical divisions imposed by modernism upon aesthetic forms, a protest now driven by a radi calized conception of what film's dependence on time and duration might entail: "Formalist art criticism has continued to maintain a stern, emphatic distinction between these two states, a division that I consider absurd. Everything that occurs, including the (electro chemical) process of thinking, occurs in time."46 McCall's critical "script" for Long Film for Ambient Light, the posted essay "Notes in Duration"-from which the preceding statements are taken would propose an almost strictly Bergsonian critique of the false divisions imposed by human consciousness on the continuity and multiplicity, the ungraspable mutability, inherent to both time and to film, inasmuch as the latter belongs to the former. "Our insis tence upon static, absolute lumps of experience," McCall pointed out, "as opposed to continuous, overlapping, multiple durations, shows a warped epistemology, albeit a convenient one." That noth ing was static, that time was a base condition not only particular to the medium of film but ultimately providing a continuity between all things, was McCall's assertion. He proceeded first to redefine artistic categories on the basis of duration: "Art that does not show change within our time-span of attending to it we tend to regard as 'object.' Art that does show change within our time-span of attend ing to it we tend to regard as 'event.' Art that outlives us we tend to regard as 'eternal."' And then McCall concluded, "What is at issue is that we ourselves are the division that cuts across what is essen tially a sliding scale of time-bases. A piece of paper on the wall is as much a duration as the projection of a film."47 There is a limit being proposed here, a limit to understanding and representability that other aesthetic philosophies have named the "sublime."48 It is a limit located in the immense ungraspability of time itself, a limit displaced around the human body's channel 1 18 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="28">ing of intellection through the arbitrary limits of this same body. It is a limit transgressed in every direction by the temporal, which links a piece of paper and a film projection, a thought and a tree. That such radical continuity would only be augmented by film's dependence not only on time but on light-this adds to the wild ness of McCall's position in Long Film. For light is as all-encom passing as time and as violent to the limits on vision and visuality put in place by our bodies as is time. That film would expand to become coextensive with both these conditions-light and time would be to propose an almost primordial coextensiveness of film and other aesthetic forms, but also of film and the world, and most crucially of film and the observing subject. Here we return to the scene of "absorption" and "incorporation" with which this essay began; we reach the culmination, that is, of the logic begun as the viewers were asked to face the projector in the first of McCall's solid light films. In a beautiful essay on J.M.W. Turner-a painter of not inconsiderable interest to an account of the issues raised by McCall's films-Jonathan Crary describes precisely this radical understanding of light, its elimination of "the distance between subject and object, that is, between a viewer and the world," in favor of a "physical inscription" of light within the body. Looking to paintings by Turner such as his Regulus-a scene of a punishment enacted by being forced to stare directly and without respite into the sun-Crary concludes: The direct interface of sun and eye is what overturns a stable separation between the subject and the object, between inte rior sensation and exterior stimulus. To distinguish between the radiance emanating from the sun and the subjective lumi nous effects in the eye of the observer becomes meaningless Joseph Mallord William Turner. Regulus, 1828. t Tate, all rights reserved. Baker I Film Beyond Its Limits 119</page><page sequence="29">for Turner: they are inherent in each other. The lived body of the spectator and the exterior world of physical events are one indivisible field.49 It was this radical continuity that McCall understood to be repressed in the institutional modes of cinema's existence, but which could be released by the transgressive movement of film into a communication with other forms. It was this continuity that the solid light films explored, overcoming the limits, in Crary's words, "between figure and ground, subject and object, interior experience and outer events, light and darkness, near and far, center and periphery."50 And it would be this continuity-once more to use Crary's words-that would present us with another moment in which the "aspiration to expand radically the limits of sensory experience parallels the convulsive unfolding of social, political, and technological change."'51 As McCall himself has recently gone back to pick up the form of the solid light film, returning to their production in the course of the last few years, we may want to won der quite a bit more about this transgressive continuity proposed through the medium of film. In other words, what I have called the radical "becoming other" of the film medium may be an important lesson to relearn today, at a moment when it could be proposed that projection, film, and cinema have begun to recode definitively the existence and continuation of almost all the previously static forms of contemporary art. 1 20 Grey Room 20</page><page sequence="30">Notes This essay was first published in the exhibition catalogue Anthony McCall: Film Installations, ed.

Scott MacDonald points out the conventional narrative structure of Line Describing a Cone in his interview with McCall: "MacDonald: One thing I've noticed with Line Describing a Cone and other minimal films is that they do create a nar rative experience, but they change its location: Line Describing a Cone takes the narrative off the screen and locates it in the theater space. McCall: Yes, Line Describing a Cone is a type of narrative film. MacDonald: And not only narrative, but structurally conventional. There's a sort of climax of activity and then a period of denouement near the end." See Scott MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," A Critical Cinema 2: Interviews with Independent Filmmakers (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California, 1992), 167. 8. McCall, "Two Statements," 250-251. 9. The production of "distance" and the logic of spectatorial "incorporation" may not be as diametrically opposed as my description here implies, however. In a recent text, film theorist Kaja Silverman embraces the interplay of both terms as a recipe for a contemporary political cinema. See Kaja Silverman, "Political Ecstasy," The Threshold of the Visible World (London: Routledge, 1996). 10. Of course, these short sentences do little justice to the full "communication of forms" posed by Picabia's spectacle, which, contrary to the critical tradition, I understand as an explicit anti-Gesamtkunstwerk. A full reading of both Picabia's Rel?che and Entr'acte will be included in my forthcoming book The Artwork Caught by the Tail: Francis Picabia and Dada in Paris (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2007); a telescoped account can be found in "Entr'acte," October 105 (Summer 2003): 159-165. Rel?che was followed by a theatrical sequel entitled Cin?-Sketch Baker I Film Byond Its Limits 121</page><page sequence="31">that proposed an even more radical communication between theater and cinema, and, as its title suggests, drew on the correspondences that could be drawn between a theatrical "sketch" and the sense of the term that relates more directly to pictorial arts such as painting and drawing. 11. MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 165. 12. For the clearest and most incisive formulation of this moment of shift, see Hal Foster, "The Crux of Minimalism," The Return of the Real (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996). 13. This is close to the reading long ago proposed by Rosalind Krauss in "Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd," Artforum 4, no. 9 (May 1966): 24-26. 14. We must look again to Rosalind Krauss, the greatest critical advocate of both minimalism and postminimalism, for the key articulation of postminimalism's work of medium "expansion." See Rosalind Krauss, "Sculpture in the Expanded Field," The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1985). A transformed definition and reexamination of the very concept of a medium stands at the center of Krauss's recent work. See, for example, Rosalind Krauss, "A Voyage on the North Sea ": Art in the Age of the Post-Medium Condition (London and New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1999). 15.1 have sketched this transgressive model briefly in relation to sculpture in a review of Pamela Lee's book on the art of Gordon Matta-Clark, Object to Be Destroyed (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). See my "At the Limits of Sculpture," Art Journal 60, no. 3 (Fall 2001): 105-107. Matta-Clark was of course an important con temporary of McCall's, and their projects should be compared on every level (espe cially Matta-Clark's own linkage of sculpture and film); one of Matta-Clark's most important works, Conical Intersect, was directly inspired by or indeed an homage to McCall's Line Describing a Cone. 16. On McCall's early performances and on Landscape for White Squares more specifically, which seems to have been filmed as part of a commission by the BBC to produce short films for children, see Felipe Ehrenberg, "On Conditions," Art and Artists 7 (June 1973): 39-43. 17. MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 160-161. It should be noted of course that McCall's films also involve a concerted reflection upon drawing, dependent as they are upon basic and quite primitive techniques of line animation (the out modedness of which is perhaps also crucial to reflect upon today, as McCall's more recent resumption of solid light films now depends on digital animation tech niques). The place of drawing in the larger interplay of mediums at the moment of process art and postminimalism is a topic I cannot confront here; but it has been articulated very well elsewhere, for example, in the essays contained in the cata logue Afterimage: Drawing through Process, ed. Cornelia H. Butler (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999). 18. Benjamin Buchloh, "Process Sculpture and Film in the Work of Richard Serra" (1978), in Richard Serra, ed.

Annette Michelson, "The Films of Richard Serra: An Interview" (1979), in Richard Serra, ed. Foster and Hughes, 25. 23. Michelson, "The Films of Richard Serra," 33. Hal Foster's recent essay on Serra isolates the manner in which Serra has long used the medium of sculpture to critique other mediums, especially architecture, often highlighting repressed 122 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="32">points of connection in the process. See Hal Foster, "The Un/making of Sculpture" (1998), in Richard Serra, ed. Foster and Hughes. 24. Anthony McCall, program note for a 1974 screening at Collective for Living Cinema/Film Forum, New York City, n.p. 25. J. Hoberman points out that McCall's Line Describing a Cone is a diametric reversal of the logic of what he calls the "Lumi?re apparatus," which was "designed to have a cone describe a plane." J. Hoberman, "Celestial Events," The Village Voice, 13 November 2001,109. 26. McCall, program note. 27.1 am thinking here of Gilles Deleuze, who opposes the "mold" to "modula tion" in his books on cinema. In a part of his book that should be more fully con sulted for its thoughts on analogy as well (key to later thoughts in my own essay), Deleuze writes, "The movement-image is the object; the thing itself caught in movement as continuous function. The movement-image is the modulation of the object itself. . . . The similar and the digital, resemblance and code, at least have in common the fact that they are moulds, one by perceptible form, the other by intelligible structure: that is why they can so easily have links with each other. But modulation is completely different; it is a putting into variation of the mould, a transformation of the mould at each moment of the operation. If it refers to one or several codes, it is by grafts, code-grafts that multiply its power (as in the elec tronic image). By themselves, resemblances and codifications are poor methods; not a great deal can be done with codes, even when they are multiplied, as semi ology endeavors to do. It is modulation that nourishes the two moulds and makes them into subordinate means, even if this involves drawing a new power from them. For modulation is the operation of the Real, in so far as it constitutes and never stops reconstituting the identity of image and object." Gilles Deleuze, Cinema 2: The Time-Image, trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Robert Galeta (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989), 27-28; emphasis in original. 28. McCall, program note. 29. Here I register my partial disagreement with the recent essay of Philippe Alain Michaud, which takes very seriously the connection of McCall's project to tradition and to the art of the past. See Philippe-Alain Michaud, "Line Light: Le cin?ma g?om?trique de Anthony McCall," Les Cahiers du Mus?e Nationale d'Art Moderne 85 (Fall 2003): 78-89. 30. Perhaps only fellow members of the postminimalist context in fact produce anything even remotely close to this promiscuity of bodies and cameras. I am thinking of Dan Graham's more or less contemporaneous films such as Body Press. 31. MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 164. 32. It is important to note the manner in which McCall seems to work with factors of four throughout this work, a number seemingly arrived at through a sculptural consideration of architectural space (with its four corners) as well as a sculptural treatment of the projection apparatus (with its four spatial possibili ties). One wonders if the fact that there exist only four cone films carries significance in this sense as well. 33. Anthony McCall, "Line Describing a Cone and Related Films," October 103 (Winter 2003): 52. 34. MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 163; emphasis added. 35. The term is No?l Burch's. See, for example, Noel Burch, Life to Those Shadows, trans, and ed. Ben Brewster (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California, 1990). 36. Annette Michelson, "Film and the Radical Aspiration" (1966), in The New Baker | Film Beyond Its Limits 123</page><page sequence="33">American Cinema, ed. Gregory Battcock (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1967), 101. 37. As is so often the case, my use of the term analogy throughout this essay must be seen in light of Kaja Silverman's recent elaboration of the meaning of the analogical via a reflection on the painting of Gerhard Richter. As yet unpublished, Silverman's reflections were presented in two public lectures in New York City entitled "How to Paint History," Part I (CUNY, 3 December 2003) and Part II (Columbia University, 8 December 2003). 38. At the moment of his initiation of the solid light films, McCall would appro priate a map detailing all of the lighthouses dotting the coast of England, a work he would entitle Found Solid Light Installation, 1973.1 also point the reader to the description of McCall's work by J. Hoberman, "Celestial Events," 109: "Watching McCall's movie, one watches the gradual transformation of the projector beam as one might an eclipse. To add to the effect, the various imperfections that fleck the film base send out split-second rays that explode like shooting stars." 39. Ehrenberg, in "On Conditions," reads McCall's early work in terms of rit ual; more recently, Michaud, in "Line Light," appropriates the project for a reflec tion upon the mythological. The reading of the project as "spiritual" emerges in McCall's interview with Scott MacDonald, where the interviewer states, "On one level, the film [Line Describing a Cone] is a product of serious, analytical thinking about the structure of film exhibition. On another, it's close to a spiritual experi ence." Later in this interview, McCall agrees that the work has a "spiritual qual ity." MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 161. 40. MacDonald, "Anthony McCall," 161. 41. Including, previously, by myself: I point the reader to the roundtable dis cussion organized by myself and Malcolm Turvey, where I ask McCall directly about this putative "endgame." See "The Projected Image in Contemporary Art," October 104 (Spring 2003): 71-96. 42. More than any other of McCall's previous works, then, Long Film for Ambient Light might pose a connection to the artistic practices that most specifi cally radicalized the linguistic basis of the Duchampian readymade; namely, Conceptual art. An argument has recently been made that such indeed is the arena and the frame through which we should come to understand the logic of McCall's project. See Jonathan Walley, "The Material of Film and the Idea of Cinema: Contrasting Practices in Sixties and Seventies Avant-Garde Film," October 103 (Winter 2003): 15-30. While Walley's model of what he names "para-cinema"?in his words, "an array of phenomena that are considered 'cinematic' but that are not embodied in the materials of film as traditionally defined" (18)?should be taken in dialogue with the expansion of mediums that I explore throughout this essay, his argument rests upon a false and ultimately Platonic separation of "matter" and "idea" that is one of the most common and banal of the misreadings to which so called Conceptual art has been repeatedly subjected. I would insist that is quite precisely to the intransigently material practices of postminimalism that all of McCall's early work and Long Film for Ambient Light need to be related. And, on the subject of film and cinema, McCall himself hardly separates the two forma tions on the level of matter and idea: for McCall, film is, quite precisely, an artistic "medium," but cinema is just as earth-bound, being instead a "social institution." See McCall's remarks in the roundtable discussion "The Projected Image in Contemporary Art," 74. 43. McCall, "Two Statements," 252. 44.1 am using the word condition in a purposeful way, and it should recall the critic Felipe Ehrenberg's use of the term to name McCall's early, prefilmic "events" 124 Grey Room 25</page><page sequence="34">or "happenings." Ehrenberg seems to have elaborated this term in dialogue with McCall himself. See the definition of the term in Ehrenberg, "On Conditions," 41. In the essay (script?) "Notes in Duration" included in the installation of Long Film for Ambient Light, McCall points to both light and time as the elements of film that he has retained: "I am now interested in reducing the 'performance' aspect, in order to examine certain other fundamentals, viz. temporality, light. I am presently assuming that it is possible to do this without using the customary photochemical and electro-mechanical processes." See McCall, "Two Statements," 253. Jonathan Walley points out that such a redefinition of film was not peculiar only to McCall but was contained in certain theorizations of film from the period, such as that of Sheldon Renan. See Walley, 16. In his recent October text, McCall points to the happenings movement as essential to his own artistic development and ends his text with an otherwise enigmatic assertion that John Cage was perhaps the key fig ure not only for that movement's elaboration but for projected image work gener ally and for his own work specifically. Long Film for Ambient Light allows the connection to Cage in McCall's project to become unmistakable, although my characterization of the effects of this "aesthetic" hardly conforms to conventional understandings of Cage's contribution. See McCall, "Line Describing a Cone and Related Films," 60-62. 45. McCall, "Line Describing a Cone and Related Films," 56; and McCall, "Two Statements," 252. 46. McCall, "Two Statements," 252. 47.

That it would hold a central place in the radicalization of the limits of the phenomenological project of minimalist art by the strategies of postminimalism has been the contri bution of Pamela Lee's recent work on Gordon Matta-Clark. See Pamela Lee, "On Matta-Clark's 'Violence'; Or, What Is a 'Phenomenology of the Sublime'?" Object to Be Destroyed. 49. Jonathan Crary, "The Blinding Light," in J.M.W.
