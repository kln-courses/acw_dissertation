<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LVI, No. 5 FEBRUARY 26, 1959 THE JOuRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY TOWARD A RADICAL NATURAIJSM * A FRESH and vital system of ideas has been introduced into the world of contemporary philosophy through Justus Buchler 's Toward a General Theory of Humarn Judgmenet and Nature and Judgment. These works present a bold challenge to existing forms of philosophic practice, and offer an exciting blue- print for the future course of our social and humanistic evaluations of man and his works. Buchler's thought, impressive in its power to articulate a novel philosophy of man, is to be located properly within the twentieth-century naturalistic renaissance, for his work establishes new directions in its rich heritage. In the rebirth of any intellectual tradition, polemic against the old orders is fused with a promise of the new. Perhaps prophecy and moral vision are inescapable consequences in the thought of a Bacon, Hegel, or Dewey as they plot, shape and fix the range of new intellectual possibilities. However, without sustained criti- cism and systematic thought, perpetuated by the heirs of a tradition, moral satiety and intellectual pride may well threaten its basic foundations. Fortunately, Justus Buchler 's contribution refuses to pay lip service to its philosophic allegiance, and it moves toward a naturalism that is radical in its pursuit of the consequences of that position. All naturalists are aware of the irrevocable character of nature 's repetitive workings and the inevitable cycles of birth, growth, and death that impinge upon the human figure. Natural piety is an inescapable datum in the intellectual consciousness of the philosophic naturalist. And Buchler, true to the tradition of his predecessors, recognizes that we cannot deny "the precarious tenure of the self in the world and the indefinite boundaries of the self " (Toward a General Theory of Human Judgment, p. 8). * This and the other articles that make up this issue are all concerned, directly or indirectly, with the philosophy of Justus Buchler. Each writer has chosen to treat some aspect of that philosophy which particularly interests him; it will therefore be found that this issue in no way contains either an exposition or a systematic critique of Buchler 's works. On the contrary, many crucial themes, such as proception, query, convention, or articulation, have scarcely been touched on at all.-MATTHEw LIPMAN, SPECIAL EDITOR. 193</page><page sequence="2">194 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY But Buchler's sense of the "precarious" in human life and the implications of an "indefinite" geography and history assigned to the self, upon careful examination, reveal to us a mature naturalism that does not shrink from its radical consequences. Buchler re- sists the temptation to accept the "precarious" as a form of moral shock to our humanistic disposition or philosophic allegiance. The philosopher has often been an unwitting practitioner of self-decep- tion and illusion. The Epicurean resolved the issue of the "precarious" in terms of a cosmogony of material perfection. The Stoic overcame his sense of the "precarious" through the identifica- tion of the self in some macrocosmic mirror of rational love. And the existentialist, though possessing an uncompromising awareness of man's "precarious" status, has achieved this at the cost of a conversion of the human domain into a series of ungratified ten- sions, where moral paradox and human predicament are the only eternal values. Obviously the ways of settling our moral concern with the natural destiny of the self are many. This total retreat from a radical naturalism is to be observed in Whitehead's allusions to a systematic anthropomorphism; in the harmonic self-sustaining world of internal relations for the idealist; and in the artifice of human experience, created by the recent analysts, to conform to their methods for cognitive safety. And even within the ranks of recent naturalism there appears little desire to come face to face with man's "precarious tenure." Dewey's predilection for over- populating man's universe in the "foreground" of nature with the sophisticated social instruments for problem-solving may, as Santa- yana suggested, disguise an unsuspecting "transcendental moral- ism." But Santayana himself, with all of his honest and accurate vision, would have us turn from a careful delineation of the natural career and destiny of the individual self to a transeendental drama of ideas. The inability to discourse about man as he is revealed to us in his natural setting cannot contribute towards an effective meta- physics of the individual. Consequently it provides us with no satisfactory image of man as a being whose integral character is ever in the process of being achieved, not in spite of its precarious- ness or incompleteness, but because of it. The individual has been traditionally reconstructed into a series of discrete acts or thoughts; or his achievements have been celebrated as episodic and fortuitous; or he has been seen only through a dense medium of society, polity, the race, history, or the absolute-despite the fact that these media are, in turn, the temporal products and organized achievements of integral selves. Buehler clearly addresses himself to this point. "The fact that man is characterized by a state of natural debt, by</page><page sequence="3">TOWARD A RADICAL NATURALISM 195 a perpetual incompletion, does not east doubt on the existence of individuals but emphasizes only the extended nature of individual- ity, its communicative essence, and the indefinite bounds of its relatedness" (Nature and Judgment, p. 106). Man's "precarious tenure " for Buchler, therefore, is not an evil of existence, a dilemma to be overcome, thus feeding our hunger for illusory formulas to resolve our moral anxiety. Rather it becomes a key to the understanding of the organized human effort necessary to the promotion and elaboration of human life. Man's own works serve to reveal him in his emergence and cumulative development. Rec- ognition of our state as one of "perpetual incompletion" uproots certain conventional notions of man and experience. Man com- pletes himself neither in society or history, nor through his ideals or solved problems. His movements and decisions do not pass out of his domain of selfhood into some desert of eternal forget- fulness. Experience is not simply a series of terminal points. For Buchler the direction of experience would entail a process of continuing production, articulated by the self, rather than, as for Dewey, a series of consummatory acts, indicative of the self. The terminology of "consummatory" acts still relies strongly upon viewing man through the lenses of traditional psychology, through the categories of feeling and memory. An ontological set- ting for man in the nature of things gives way to a psychological transcription of human experience. As Buchler cautions us, "what an individual assimilates is what he sustains, not what he feels" (Nature and Judgment, p. 138). And, in spite of the naturalists' endeavor to bring man descriptively back to his natural habitat, this allegiance to a traditional psychological perspective does not permit him to alter significantly the older interpretations of atom- ism and discretism in experience. It is reproduced on a grand scale in viewing the products and achievements by the individual self without a sense of the continuing relation of one product to another in terms of the common producer. Products become re- lated to the urgencies and exigencies of the conditions that pro- voked the initial problem and the need for its resolution. But what are these conditions? To argue that they are problematic, unsettled, or unresolved is to beg the question. For the naturalist, "incompletion" becomes an initial and presumptive circumstance which effective intellectual or moral con- duct resolves; it is never a perpetual or real condition. And much of our recent naturalistic tradition has come to accept the problem- atic, the unresolved, or the indeterminate as circumstantial situa- tions confronting the self, rather than as the indelible character of the self-in-process (proception). Buchler incorporates man's</page><page sequence="4">19G THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY questing and query all within the movement of proception. Query is lnot simply a stage in reflective thinking towards the resolution of a problem, but a clarification of the ways the proceptive process moves towards its self-continuation. The language of articulation, for Buehler, may share a pragmatic outlook (a methodological pragmatism) with the language of resolution (instrumental prag- matism). However, the latter 's orientation is not only nar- rower, but its instrumental commitment depreciates the actual and elevates the eternal ideality of the settled as good. Perhaps the philosophy of instrumentalism may not be alien to our moral expectations, but it becomes estranged from the world of natural events characterizing the human animal. Instrumentalism has bor- rowed Darwin's adaptation, as a fact of natural selection, to work as a norm for moral improvement. A drastic revisionism, or radical stance, for philosophic natural- ism implies that man is as he is-in-the-process of revealing himself. Not only are overt or unmasked teleologies swept away, but a philosophy of process, as applicable to this sense of man, becomes necessary. Whether an "active " or "passive " vocabulary is assigned to any particular version of experience, we must, as Locke would remind us, still account for the identity of the indi- vidual in terms of his organized self. Furthermore, the recognition of the forward-moving character of the self in time is intimately bound up with the self 's unique achievements and directed energies. Buehler 's neolog,ism of " proception, " indicating " the natural historicity of the individual," clearly points to the fact that man's career "cannot be propulsive and directed without being cumu- lative' (Nature and Judgment, p. 114). This thesis brings to- gether the characteristics of motion, organization, and development -all equally important categories for any satisfactory analysis of the human self. "The interplay of the human individual's activi- ties and dimensions, their unitary direction constitutes a process which I shall call proception. The term is designed to suggest a moving union of seeking and receiving, of forward propulsion and patient absorption" (Toward a General Theory of Human Judg- ment, p. 4). Here is a suggestive kernel of Buchler 's radical naturalism. It provides us with a method of analysis considering man as an integral being whose character, movement, and pro- duction must be viewed in the light of his unitary career as an individual. Proception, then, indicates the individual's unique, cumulative movement in nature and his relation to it. The indi- vidual's world is thus never wholly fixed and settled, nor prepared for such completion. That world may be altered or strengthened</page><page sequence="5">T OWARD A RADICAL NATURALISM 197 by its procepts, but its domain is ever the "summed-up-self-in- process." The proceptive domain is fixed neither spatially nor temporally. The only "here" is theoretically located in the "floating proceptive domain," and the only "now" or "at the moment" is in the "imminent proceptive domain." The tradi- tional dualisms between the actual and the ideal are broken down, since both are incorporated as procepts in the process of man's self-revelation, through his judgments or products. What is and prospectively what ought to be work upon one another, not as anti- thetical realities, but as diversified procepts within the proceptive domain. What enters into man 's productivity is his mirroring of both fact and thought, real and ideal, thing and idea-all are the ingredients making possible our human process. The image of man as ever reaching out beyond the moment, propulsively set in nature, does just violence to the older Humian version of experience as cyclical and repetitive. Hume's tradition is actually a retreat from even a Hobbesian scheme. Hobbes would regard experience as mechanically additive, but driven prospec- tively by desire and endeavor. Hobbes at least celebrates man's productive powers in his capacity to shape a mortal God, whereas Hume can only wonder at the constancy of experience to repeat itself through habit. Certainly the impact of our social, historical, and biological modes of awareness from the nineteenth century introduced categories of alteration and cumulative change as ap- plicable to our interpretation of the human domain. For Hegel man embodies the process of history, as its agent, through the stages of altered consciousness. But process as forward propulsion is dimmed by the past glories of consciousness. Precariousness, as a datum of existence, is lost as mind eternalizes itself through its own enactments. And the hint of a radical vision in Hobbes, willing to accept and to see man in the uncertainty and fallibility of his productions, is forsaken by Hegel's retrospective view of man 's progressive contributions to his heritage. But the response of Dewey and Whitehead is to bring process for human experience back into a natural setting. For Dewey process serves as a proof of man's naturalness, in the language of interaction and transaction. The difficulty of this objective is that it is but a preliminary to the successful reconstruction of ex- perience as a total process. Man and nature remain as entities, though joined by transactional exchange. Man unmistakably en- ters nature; but how much of nature adheres to man without fully pursuing the implications of the fact of precariousness? And how much of that natural process becomes a movement of intelligence</page><page sequence="6">198 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY answering the moral necessity to overcome our social antinomies? For Whitehead process becomes the organic touchstone against which all things are measured. Entities become undistinguishable from one another by virtue of this generic kinship. The fact that Whitehead threatens to anthropomorphize all of nature is of less concern than the inability to apply this process towards a con- sistent metaphysics of the integral self. It is process devoid of the facts of human achievement.1 Buehler 's advance over his predecessors is clearly observable in the concept of proception. Process, as characteristic of the human individual, is not derivable, for Buehler, from the simple motions in nature, as for Hobbes; nor is it simply a projection of historic time, as maintained by Hegel; nor does it become equiva- lent to the exchange relation holding between man and nature, within Dewey's metaphysic; nor an extension of organic nature, argued by Whitehead. Process in Buchler's metaphysics is dis- tinctively a human movement, derived phenomenologically from an awareness of man as he is in-the-process of revealing himself. The emphasis is neither upon the genesis nor upon the realized of experience. Buchler, unlike his naturalistic predecessors, need not set out to demonstrate the natural source of our experience; it is simply affirmed in the very texture of proception itself. And the teleology implicit in the view of experience as a process of self-realization would run counter to Buchler 's radical orienta- tion. Man, in the process of revealing himself, for Buehler, is articulative and evocative and, as such, is a creature of judgment or production. As a judicative being man is ever in the process of shaping and fixing his proceptive materials. Though an indi- vidual 's products may emerge through various guises-as ex- hibitive, assertive, and active judgments-they are all nurtured in the soil of a common proceptive domain. In this judicative func- tion man demonstrates not only his relation with the structure of nature impinging upon him, but he also extends his process of utterance to others through communication, in the conventions of judgment. Thus the concept of process, as assigned to the human individual, implies a dimension of extensity that is communicable, examinable, and corrigible. Though individuals are "unitary 1 In terms of Buehler 's clear recognition of such achievement, in his categories of "'judgment" or "'product," his concept of proception stands apart from Whitehead 's notion of process. Further, since not all natural complexes are procepts, it is difficult to understand Edwin Garlan's criticism that Buchler s treatment of experience, like Whitehead 's, "would seem to apply to any organized process whatever, human or not" (Review of Nature and Judgment, this JOURNAL, Vol. LIV, No. 20, Sept. 26, 1957, p. 620).</page><page sequence="7">TOWARD A RADICAL NATURALISM 199 proceivers" and communities unto themselves, their powers of productivity establish the milieu for the social community. To see the human process as a continuity of the process of productivity suggests that our interpretation of products as almost exclusively assertive requires serious modification. Evaluating man's productive achievements requires a more accurate account- ing of human experience as we encounter it, and not prefigured in accordance with our antecedent intellectual commitments. Justus Buchler has opened up new avenues in philosophic criticism directed towards our multiple products-intellectual, moral, and aesthetic. We cannot relegate products, other than perhaps the purely "cognitive," to the shadows of non-rational discourse without doing violence to the reality of the self. The classical antinomies of reason-emotion and rational-empirical have drawn up some order of pure intelligibleness against which are measured the less than pure human accomplishmelnts. We have so thoroughly depreciated the world of experience that only by the deliberate intervention of some "external" order, or method, imposed on the random and unformed, do we believe that experience can become productive. And we ignore completely the fact that the methodic is present in experience by virtue of man 's evocative nature. How adequate is our understanding of man 's apparent success in utter- ance and production if we turn our studies of method into pro- grams and prescriptions for intellectual performance? Appreciatingf man as a producer, rather than simply as a maker or knower, is to recognize the human process as prospective and viable. An individual 's proceptive wealth, to paraphrase Adam Smith, lies not in what he has collected but in what he is to produce. Our view of experience advances from one of simple accumulation to that of cumulative productivity. This radical stance sees man as forward-moving rather than backward-looking. What Buchler is celebrating here is ultimately in harmony not only with the heritage of naturalism, but with the deep sources of our humanistic tradition. This is the tradition that makes the power of the person central, and implies a metaphysics of plural- ism among men. Each man becomes the source and center for his own possible achievements. His works can never escape the marks of his own identity. And human life achieves power through the constancy of its self-affirmations, though the precarious and uncertain can never be masked from the reality of our mortal destiny.
