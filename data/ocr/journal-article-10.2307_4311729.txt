<plain_text><page sequence="1">InternationalJournal of Sbi'i Studies, vol. 1, no.1, 2003, Global Scholarly Publications, ISSN 1544-1326, 224 pp. This journal is a welcome addition to the range of academic journals published in the fields of Islamic studies and Iranian religion and its first issue, reviewed here, augurs well for the future. Although a few criticisms of this issue will be pre- sented in this review, these problem areas are outweighed by the information and insights contained in this issue of the journal. The issue begins with an editorial foreword. In this the editors assert that the object of study of this journal should henceforth be called Tashayyu' rather than Shi'ism. Their argument for this position is not however helped by exaggerated claims-while there has been a certain level of use of the name Tashayyu' by Shi'i scholars, it has not been as general as the editors maintain and it is not in common use. As I happened to be using a CD of Agha Buzurg Tihrani's twenty-five- volume bibliography, al-Dhari'a ila Tasanif al-Shi'ah, I conducted a search on the word "tashayyu"' and found only three books with this word in the title, while in the text of the book, it was almost exclusively being used with a meaning of "being or becoming a Shi'i" rather than as a name for the religion itself. Nor are the editor's arguments for the use of Tashayyu' helped by</page><page sequence="2">336 Reviews employing a spurious etymology-while deriving the word "Shi'ah" from "shu'a"'may be satisfying for the pious, it is surprising to see such historical and linguistic errors being propounded in a serious academic journal. This pro- posal that we substitute Tashayyu' for the present usage of Shi'ism presents several practical problems also. Would one, for example, employ the name "Isma'ili Tashayyu"' when one wants to specify that particular form of Shi'i Islam? An Isma'ili scholar whom I consulted over the issue rejected this usage outright. Another question that arises and is not resolved in the editorial foreword is whether the subject of this journal is to be Twelver Shi'i Islam exclusively or Shi'i Islam in general, including, for example, Isma'ili Shi'i Islam. With regard to the specific articles, there is not space to make detailed com- ments. The two articles by Mahmoud Ayoub and Idris Samawi Hamid were inter- esting and informative, albeit those who are engaged in the field will already be familiar with the material from these authors' book and doctoral thesis respect- ively. Ayoub's paper examines the problem of evil and suffering in Islam, dealing in turn with the Qur'an, the Sunni Traditions and the Shi'i ethos of redemptive suffering. The lack of references and the usual scholarly apparatus limit its usefulness for those who want to look into the matter further (and even some of the references that are given are incomplete Job 38-42 on p. 24, for example). The paper by Hamid on the metaphysics of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i is the most systematic, scholarly, and informative in this issue of the journal. Al-Ahsa'i's writings are difficult to penetrate but, as this paper demonstrates, the effort is worthwhile as al-Ahsa'i's work may be said to rep- resent the culmination of attempts to integrate all of the major streams in Islamic intellectual and mystical life. Hamid's paper focuses on the Shaykh's explanation and use of the word al-Hikmah and in particular the Proof of Wisdom (dalil al-hikmah). The article by Mostafa Mohaqqeq Damad on Christianity is, as the title pro- claims, "Brief Remarks..." and seemed to jump from topic to topic without dealing with any one of them in any depth. There is some discussion of the concept of logos in Christianity and Islam, but this does not contribute anything new to this discussion. The work by the author in establishing the exact biblical texts used in a number of Traditions of the Imams is interesting, although its use- fulness is limited by the fact that there are no references in this article and so one cannot easily locate the Traditions to which he is referring. The article by Liyakatali Takim, authority construction in biographical texts, touches upon the important question of the changing nature of orthodox Shi'i doctrines in the early period of Shi'i history-the fact that many of the leading followers of the Imams held to doctrines that later became regarded as heretical. In the case of one such Shi'i, Muhammad al-Nu'man al-Ahwal, who held to the doctrine of anthropomorphism, the paper examines how later Sunni and Shi'i writers of biographical dictionaries dealt with this fact. One notes with some consternation, however, that the entire paper has no notes and gives no refer- ences. Another paper with no notes or references is that of Sajjad Rizvi on the</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 337 soteriology of Wilayab. This is an important subject, one that is fundamental to Shi'i Islam, and one that cannot be dealt with adequately in eighteen pages, but the article by Ayoub and this one by Rizvi together do provide a reasonable survey of this theme. The last paper is by Mohammad Reza Hejazi on Mulla Muhsin Faiz Kashani and deals with the frequently neglected area of ethics. Hejazi provides a biogra- phy of Mulla Muhsin, reviews the latter's metaphysics and then proceeds to examine his writings on ethics, bringing out in particular this scholar's depen- dence on Abu Hamid al-Ghazzali. The paper does however make some question- able statements. Thus for example on page 188, the following sentence occurs: "In the Islamic tradition, namely the Holy Qur'an and the Prophetic narration, the technical term 'virtue' (fadilah) has played a significant role, not only in shaping a virtue-based moral system, but also in establishing the criteria for evaluating moral actions and behaviours." Firstly, the word fadilah does not appear in the Qur'an. Secondly, it is somewhat tautological to say that the term "virtue" has played a significant role in shaping a virtues-based moral system. Thirdly, it is difficult to see how a term can shape a system or establish criteria presumably the author meant that the concept had done so. The last item in the journal is a brief description by Nasrollah Pourjavady of a manuscript anthology which may represent the teaching of the twelfth-century philosopher Majd al-Din Jili. The manuscript is however of only marginal interest to Shi'i studies and moreover there is no indication in the paper of where this manuscript is located. One hopes that the brief descriptive "Book Notes" at the back of the issue will eventually be expanded into full book reviews. Finally there is a description of the transliteration system being used in this journal for the first time, a system which like all transliteration systems has both advantages and disadvantages-a fact acknowledged by the editors of the journal in that they do not transliterate the words "Shi'i" and "Tashayyu"' in accordance with it. Other criticisms that might be made include the poor standard of English spelling (for example, p. 29, 1. 5: "sited" instead of "cited"; p. 70, mid-page: "intension" instead of "intention") and usage (see the above example from Hejazi's paper) in some of the articles. The editors do not tell us whether some of these articles have been translated for their inclusion here and so one does not know if it is the authors or the translators who produced the poor English, but in any case, the editors could have done more to eliminate it. In all then, this first issue of the journal is a useful and interesting start. Assum- ing that the journal is aimed at academic audiences and is not just intended for the educated and enlightened Shi'i believer, the editors will need to insist on higher standards if the journal is to become accepted in academic circles. Including papers without references and allowing a poor standard of English cannot be allowed to continue if the journal is to become a respected publication in the field.
