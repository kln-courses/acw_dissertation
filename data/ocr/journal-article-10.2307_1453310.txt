<plain_text><page sequence="1">IBN KAMMUTNAH'S TREATISE ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RABBANITES AND THE KARAITES By LEON NEMOY, Dropsie University SA'D IBN MANS$UR IBN KAMMUNAH, by vocation an ophthal- mologist with a clientele of patients among the upper echelons of the imperial capital of Baghdad,' by avocation a keen and original student of philosophy and theology, and by his talents one of the most remarkable personalities in medieval Judeo-Arabic literature, had to wait for over six hundred years to be resurrected from sorely undeserved oblivion and restored to anywhere near his rightful place in the history of Jewish thought. No Jewish author seems to have consider- ed him worthy of mention. His Muslim readers had an in- terest, though a rather slim one, only in his medical and purely philosophical works, which are still in manuscript and await publication and study. His rediscovery in, the West was due to Moritz Steinschneider, who in I878 des- cribed the unique manuscript of the work with which we shall presently deal, in his catalogue of the Hebrew manus- cripts in the Prussian State Library in Berlin.2 In I892 Hartwig Hirschfeld published the text of this manuscript,3 1 A rather tarnished capital by this time, after the Mongols had captured it (in the year 1258) and written finis to the Arab-Persian caliphate, even in its late, purely nominal, form, shorn of all real power, and manipulated at will by Turkish quasi-vassals who exercised actual dominion over their individual realms. 2 Verzeichnis der hebraeischen Handschriften [der Koeniglichen Bibliothek zu Berlin], i.

The rediscovery of his two other works of Jewish interest was no less slow. In I896 Ignaz Goldziher described the manuscript of Ibn Kammulnah's tract on the immortality of the soul, included in the Land- berg Collection of Arabic manuscripts now at Yale Univer- sity,5 and a facsimile of it was published by me in I944.6 Three years before Goldziher's paper, Leo Hirschfeld pu- blished an extract from Ibn Kammfinah's major theological work, entitled Tanqik al-abhJth, a comparative study of the three faiths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.7 But it was only in I925, when David H. Baneth published his masterly 4 L. Nemoy, "Ibn Kamnm-anah's Treatise on the Differences between the Rabbanites and the Karaites," American Academy for, Jewish Research, Proceedings, XXXVI (I968), I07-I65. Three small corrections have since come to light, viz.: line 229, "Ezra I0:33" is an error for "Neh. I0:33"; line 387, the awkward haqq (so Ms.) is, I suspect, a misreading of a cursive nas-khi hhabar, "the account of how Israel prepared themselves", etc.; line 8oi, bal (so Ms.) is paralleled by in in Kh I84, i8, both of which are equally awkward and represent, I suppose, a misreading of a hasty naskhi hal, which is required by the context. 5 Festschrift Steinschneider, Leipzig, I896, pp. II0-II4. The Land- berg Ms., heretofore thought to be unique, is no longer so, since Brockelmann (Geschichte der, arabischen Literatur, 2. Aufl., Leiden, I943-49, I, 555) records another Ms. in the library of Raghib Pasha in Istanbul. 6 The Arabic Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul, by ...

And more than forty additional years were to elapse before the full text of this work was made available in a superbly accurate edition and an English translation by Moshe Perlmann.9 Ibn Kammiinah paid dearly for this, his major and prob- ably his favorite theological opus. A member of that small group of intellectuals-Muslims, Jews, and perhaps also Christians-in the Muslim Empire who entertained a broad outlook on all the three faiths as variant and more or less equivalent paths to the same common goal of the godly life, he was no doubt prudent enough to have intended the Tanqik not for broadcast publication but for private cir- culation among his likeminded friends and associates. But the inevitable was bound to happen sooner or later, and by some mischance a copy of the work came before the eyes of someone who was not meant to see it, perhaps a fanatical mullah, or an envious fellow-physician, or some other person with a grudge against the author. Before long, in the year I284, the populace of Baghdad, always prone to turbulence, exploded in a riot, demanding the life of the "unbeliever" who presumed to subject Islam and its Prophet to- the cold scalpel of rational scrutiny. IHad the culprit been an ordinary citizen, the distraught authorities would undoubtedly have had no hesitation in throwing him to the wolves, but an eminent and fashionable doctor was not to be disposed of so summarily and conveniently.

He then betook himself to the neighbouring town of al-Hillah, where his son held a government post. The shock and strain of the whole incident, however, proved too much for him, and within the same year he died, a broken man, in spirit probably no less than in means of livelihood.10 The treatise on the differences between the Rabbanites and the Karaites appears to have been written some time before the TanqTi, perhaps also before the tract on the soul. The material used here, as in the TanqQ4, was for the most part not new, as the author himself conscientiously reminds us, but the presenttation of it and the calm, dispassionate, and rational line of argumentation are all his own. His principal source was the Kitdb al-Khazari (in the Hebrew version Sefer ha-KilzJirs) of Judah ha-Levi, which is exten- sively quoted, verbatim or in paraphrase," but he freely cites primary Rabbinic sources, with which he was fairly well acquainted, and of course he was at home in the Bible. The fact that he devotes to the defence of Rabbanism 10 The only sources for this biographical information are the slhort accounts in the works of his Muslim contemporary and fellowtowns- man, KamMl al-Din cAbd al-Razzaq ibn al-Fuwati (died in I323; Brockelmann, op. cit., 2.

I 2, and footnote 36). Since the Berlin unicum (copied in I34I) is more than a century older than the Oxford Ms. of Judah ha-Levi's work (copied in I463-the date I263 in Neubauer's catalogue is a misprint), it offers some corrigenda and addenda to the text of the latter work; see my notes in JQR, XXVI (I936), 22I-226. Although Hirschfeld mentioned Ibn Kamn-inunah's treatise in the introduction to his edition of the Kitab al-Khazari (Leipzig, I887, p. vi), he falsely described it as an "anonyme Schlrift" and neglected to make any use of it.</page><page sequence="5">IBN KAMM1UNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY IOI more than twice as much space as to the defence of Karaism shows, I think, quite clearly where his sympathies, however much restrained by reason, lay.12 Yet his aim, even though not expressed in so many words, is evident-to persuade both parties, Karaite and Rabbanite, that the ancient causes of the rift, however valid half a millenium ago, had lost their pertinence, that neither party had all the right on its side, and that it was high time for the breach to be healed and for the estranged Karaite branch of Jewry to be grafted back onto its ancestral tree trunk. Ibn Kammuinah was thus the first-at least so far as now known-to devote a com- paratively extensive work to such an appeal for reconcili- ation, written in his own calm and rational tone, free from the blinders imposed on the polemicist by his urge to justify his own side and to condemn the other side. Evidently he thought the time ripe for such an appeal to reason. The 12 The same consideration, in a different way, applies to the Tanqih, where Islama is given the lion's share of space. This, I believe, seems to indicate that consciously or not, the author's chief aim was to turn his critical searchlight particularly upon Islam, perhaps because Muslim writers had already produced numerous criticisms of both Judaism and Christianity, however onesided these in fact were. Ibn Kammnianah's use of the conventional Muslim pious formulae when rrmentioning the Prophet of Islairn led Steinschneider (Die arabi- sche Literahtu dey juden, Frankfurt am Main, I902, p. 239) to assume that he had become a Muslim, and Brockelinann (op. cit., i. Supple- mentband, p. 768) not only repeats this hypothesis but even amazingly enough characterizes the Tanqih as a "Verteidigung des Islams gegen Juden und Christen." The hypothesis has been thoroughly demolished by Baneth (see above, footnote 8), and one need do no more than consider the following passage in the Tanqizh (ed. Perllmann, p. 102): "We never see, down to this day, anyone entering Islamin except out of fear, or in search of power, or in order to escape heavy taxation, or to be released from low estate or frolm imprisonment, or out of infatuation for a Muslim woman, or for simailar reasons. We see no man who is well informed about both his own faith and the faith of Islam, and is in possession of influence, property, and good credit, becoming converted to Islam without being moved by any one of the aforemrentioned motives, or their like". A reputable man who within a short timne of his death speaks of converts in terms of such withering contempt could not, by any stretching of sound logic, have been a convert himself.</page><page sequence="6">I02 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW fanaticism of the violent recriminations against that be'te noire in the minds of the Karaites, the Gaon Saadiah,'3 which runs like a scarlet thread through the Karaite literature of the ioth and iith centuries, was genuine enough, yet as time went on, the fulminations against him were copied or paraphrased by later Karaite authors rather more mechani- cally than deliberately, and their vehemence (which, one must remember, remained verbal, and was scarcely ever translated into physical violence and bloodshed) turned gradually into sorrowful resignation to the reality of the Rabbanites' stubborn refusal to see the light as the Karaites saw it. By the end of the I3th century this cooling of tempers was considerably advanced, and on the Rabbanite side au- thoritative voices, including that of Maimonides, were heard in favor of more friendly coexistence and greater tolerance. Nevertheless Ibn Kammfinah's appeal for complete recon- ciliation fell on deaf ears on both sides. Half a century later an Italian Rabbanite scholar resident in Crete, Shemariah of Negroponte, surnamed ha-Iqriti (the Cretan),'4 wrote, though in lesser detail and with far less insight, on the same theme, calling upon the two sides to come together, "so that all Israel might once more become one brotherhood." He had no better luck in this respect than Ibn Kammuinah. 13 This bitterness is customarily ascribed to the Gaon's suppression of the allegedly highly successful Karaite missionary propaganda among Rabbanites. This explanation seems to me to lack both histo- rical and logical evidence. A more likely explanation, it would appear to me, is that Saadiah, by branding the Karaites as outright apostates to be completely shunned, slammed the door upon the only missionary field open to them-among their Rabbanite cousins, with whom they had heretofore maintained a more or less friendly modus vivendi-and made a dead letter out of their ever cherished hope that some day these erring cousins will return to the true Mosaic, that is Karaite, faith. See in greater detail my remarks in JQR, XL (I950), 307-315. For a history of Karaite anti-Saadian controversy, the basic manual is S.

To wit, my opinion in general regarding the statements concerning the merits of the Sages, upon whose traditions and opinions the Rabbanite Jews rely in their legal practice, as well as the nature of their transmission of the law, the reasons for the necessity of following the requirements thereof, and the charges against them brought forth by the Jewish sect of Karaites, (all this in the form of) statements and replies (thereto). And likewise the charges brought forth by the Rabbanites against the Karaites. I have set forth the (accusatory) declarations and answers, notwithstanding that my knowledge of legal details is ever so slight, in ways which for the most part, or (at least) to a large extent, I did not find in the works of my prede- cessors.22 I have arranged (all) this in three chapters, and I ask God for (His) gracious help and succor. CHAPTER I Setting 23 forth what has been mentioned of the nature of the transmissioin of the law and of the merits of the Sages who had transmitted it, explaining their erudition, and demonstrating the obligation to follow the requirements of their traditions. The Rabbanite sect of the Jews unanimously maintain that prophecy had dwelt u-ninterruptedly in the midst of Israel from the time of the prophet Moses, our master, upon whom be peace, until the expiration of forty years after the erection of the Second Temple.24 They maintain also that given. We may surmise, however, that he was a person of high rank, and probably a Jew, since the numerous Hebrew quotations and Hebrew technical terms would have been unintelligible to a non-Jew. 22 Ibn Kamm-inah does not claim that his material is new, since in fact much of it is borrowed from Judalhi ha-Levi, but only that he has set it forth in a novel fashion, which is true enough. 23 Cf. Kh III, 65 ff (P. (po if.). 24 Ezra and the last three prophets (Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) are said to have died forty years after the erection of the Second Temple (Abraham ibn Daud, SJfer ha-qabbdlTh, ed. G. D. Cohen, Philadelphia, i967, pp. I6-17). An ancient tradition (B. Meg. Isa) identifies Ezra with Malachi.</page><page sequence="9">IBN KAMMUNAR'S TREATISE-NEMOY I05 (afterwards) 25 the group of Sages known as Fellows of the Great Synagogue traced (their) tradition of the law back to the prophets, upon whom be peace, for it is said in the Mish- nah (Ab. i :i) "And the prophets transmitted it to the Fel- lows of the Great Synagogue." They thus kept haniding down the tradition from one (man) to another and from one gene- ration 26 to another, until it reached Rabbi, who is Rabbenui ha-Qadosh (our saintly master), whose name was Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi (the Prince), together with a large company of his contemporaries. These were the last of the tradents of the Mishnah, and they are known as the Tannaim. Their sole successors were the Amoraim, who were the men of the Talmud. Rabbenui ha-Qad6sh was the compiler of the Mishnah. He did the work of collecting and arranging it, and dividing its contents into orders, chapters, and halakahs, setting down the traditions in such a manner as to make it most impro- bable that it could have been a made-up affair devoid of any genuine foundation. Here is an example of how they traced (their traditions) to the prophets: (Peah 2:6) "Rabbi Nahum ha-Liblar (the Clerk) said: I received a tradition from Rabbi Miyasha, who had received it from his father, who in turn had it from the (successive) pairs (of traditionists) ,27 who again had it from the prophets, a rule (revealed orally) to Moses oni Mount Sinai," 28 (etc.). And here is an example of their wariness of tradition backed up only by individuals. One of them, while giving his final instructions on his deathbed to his son, said to him (Ed. 5:7) "My son, retract the four things that I used to tell thee about. Said the son, And why hast thou not retracted 25 Kh. 2IO, i6 states "after these forty years." 26 Literally "company". 27 Listed in Ab. i. 28 The customary formula for a rule not found in Scripture and presumed to have been revealed to Moses orally.</page><page sequence="10">io6 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW them thyself? And the father replied, I heard (my version of) them from many people, and my opponents (also) have heard (their version of) them from many others. Thus I stood upon my having heard them (from many authorities), and so did my opponents. Thou, however, hast heard (my version of) them from only one man--it is better to give up the words of one individual and to take the woi ds of the many. X This, the Rabbanites maintain, is one of the proofs of the merit of the traditions contained in the Mishnah. As for the traditions contained in the Talmud, their statements concerning their merit are well known. Whosoever examines the transmitted details of the stories of the Sages, both the Tannaim and the Amoraim, their laudable traits, their great devotion and piety, their reported behavior in moral and practical matters, the signal miracles performed by some of them, their zeal in the study of the law, the accuracy and discrimination of the Amoraimn in the interpretation of the Mishnah and the Baraita, and their reliance in it on minute investigation and (constant) verifi- cation, will have no doubt that the Rabbanites 29 consider them as having reached the utmost nobility and godliness, and (believe) that God had aided them in elevating them to a position next to that of the prophets. Their 30 learning was not restricted to legal matters, ac- cording to the Rabbanites, who adduce as proof many things (other than legal) incorporated in their legal discussions. Thus whosoever examines their precision in the science of intercalation will realize their knowledge of correct astrono- mical observation and of much of the science of astronomy. The Rabbanites mention (also) that they composed 31 a book entitled Pirqj Rabbi Eliezer containing the measurements of the earth and of each of the celestial bodies, (describing) 29 Literally "those (men) of the generality (of Israel)." 30 Cf. Kh IV, 29 (p. 284 f.). 31 "They" meaning the Sages. Kh 2I4, 4-5 reads "that he (R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus) composed," etc.</page><page sequence="11">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I07 the nature of the stars, constellations, and (stellar) images, their compartments, their indications, whether of good fortune or ill fortune, their rise, setting, elevation, or decli- nation, as well as the extent of their movements.32 The author of this work was one of the (most) prominent Sages of the Mishnah. One of the Sages of the Talmud, Samuel, said likewise (B. Ber. 58b) "The pathways of heaven are as familiar to me as the streets of (the city of) Nehardea." What 33 they mention in the rules for slaughtering and the rules concerning terJfJh comprises medical information most of which is unknown (even) to the most skilled physicians.34 The same is true of the distinction which they draw between blood of menstruation, blood of flux, blood of purification, blood of virginity, blood issuing from ulcers and hemorr- hoids, etc.; (as well as of their knowledge of) the length of menstrual periods (of the female) and flux periods of the male. The wonderful data which they give regarding leprosy are also too deep for our understanding. Yet all this represents merely occasional observations in the course of their dis- cussions of legal matters, and not deliberate discussions (of scientific subjects). The Rabbanites 35 claim that their scholars had composed (also) books devoted entirely to the astronomical, medical, and other sciernces, but that (the books devoted to) these sciences perished from among the people, since only a chosen few could cultivate them, and when these few perished, their (knowledge of these) sciences also perished, and there remained only some of the legal books, inasmuch as the mass of the people had need of them, and many persons had cultivated theni and had assiduously cared for them.

Were I not afraid of being long-winded, I would have explained (in detail) such things as they menition, pertaining to the science(s) of intercalation, slaughtering, terjfth, men- struation, flux, leprosy, etc., which prove that the Sages had mastered a number of sciences other than the science of law. Rabbi Judah ha-Levi has already explained this (at great length) in (his) Kitab al-Khazari.36 It is explicitly stated (by the Rabbanites) that the (mem- bers of the) Sanhedrin were required to master all the (secular) sciences.37 Most of the Sages of the Mishnah lived at (the time of) the Second Temple, and the prophet Jeremiah praised in his prophecies 38 the contemporaries of the Second Temple, their goodness, learning, and piety. All this shows that it is preferable (for us) to submit to their authority in legal matters rather than to anyone else's authority, so long as we cannot do without a (traditional) authority in such matters. Therefore, when we encounter in God's word such things as are capable of being interpreted in many ways, it is pre- ferable (for us) to adopt the opinions of the Sages, whose position is as aforesaid, rather than accept the opinions of others who make decisions on the basis of their own judgment and willfulness. For the Sages -were many in number, and their deductions go back to the tradition which has its source 36 Kh IV, 31 (p. 286 f.); II, 64 (p. vzo .).

Maimonides, Hilkot Sanhedrln, ii, I). The "true" sciences are those amenable to factual or rational proof, like mathematics, physics, or medicine. The "imaginary" sciences are those which are based solely on human imagination and have no factual basis, like astrology, alchemy, or magic. The "conventional" sciences are those relating to things created by general agreement among men, such as philology, poetics, or music. 38 For example, Jer. 3I, etc.</page><page sequence="13">IBN KAMMUNAH S TREATISE-NEMOY IO9 in the prophets, upon whom be peace, whereas these others do not have the same standing. Here 39 are some details of the Rabbanite traditions con- cerning the virtues of the Sages. Joseph ben Joezer was known to have committed no sin from his childhood to his death.40 Hillel the Elder, a descendant of (king) David 41 and a man of great learning, was held up as a proverbial example of (a mart of unusual) gentleness and goodness.42 He had thousands of disciples, and concerning the choicest of them it is said: 43 "Hillel the Elder had eighty (choicest) disciples. Thirty of them were worthy of having the Divine Presence rest upon them. Thirty were qualified to determine the intercalation of (a thirteenth month into leap-)years. Twenty were middling. The greatest of them was Jonathan ben Uzziel, and the least was Johanan ben Zakkai. The latter did not leave out anything of Scripture, Mishnah, Talmud, Aggada, the (hermeneutic) canons of Sages and Scribes, or anything else pertaining to Torah without studying it tho- roughly. It is said of him that he never discussed profane matters; that he never left the study-house while anyone else was yet there; that no one else ever entered the study- house ahead of him; that he never fell asleep in the study- house, either regularly or occasionally (but spent all his time while there in study); that he never went (even as little as) four cubits (of way) without (being engaged in the study 39 Cf.

His disciple Rabbi Eliezer acted in the same manner after him." The Rabbanites say that Hillel the Elder and this Johanan ben Zakkai, his disciple, lived each one hundred and twenty years,44 and the latter witnessed the destruction of the Second Temple. One of his disciples was Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyr- canus, who is the author of the famous Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer, which deal with astronomy, the measurements of the celestial bodies and of the earth, as well as all other wonderful things of the science of the stars. Some of them (even) discoursed on the mysteries of creation and of the (divine) chariot.45 Some of them reached46 a station near to prophecy, such as those of them who used to hear the voice which the Rabbanites call "Daughter of the Voice (of God)." This is a well-known matter amongst them. Similarly Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the High Priest, said (B.

Some of them became versed in the world of spirits, like Rabbi Aqiba, who lived after the destruction of the Second Temple, as it is said about him (B. Hag.

It is also said about him:49 "He was worthy of having the Divine Presence rest upon him, as was Moses, but the time was not fit for it." He was one of the company (of ten martyrs) executed by the (Roman) authorities. When about to be executed he asked his disciples whether it was time to recite the Shema'-prayer, so that he might do so. They replied (B. Ber. 6ib) "Master, (wouldst thou carry thy devotion) this far?" To which he answered: "All my days I have been troubled by the verse (Deut. 6:5) with all thy heart and all thy soul, (which means) even when He takes thy soul away from thee. Now that it has come to my hand (to put this verse into practice), should I fail to do so ? He kept drawing out the word (Deut. 6:4) (the Lord is) o-o-o-o-ne, until his soul departed (from his body)." These are only a few of the stories concerning their reported virtues. Had my purpose been to quote fully the records setting forth their high position as regards learning and good- ness, (whole) volumes would have been necessary. The few, however, which I have mentioned, will serve as specimens of what is related about them. Their sayings recorded in the Mishnah, the Talmud, and other works, extend over so many aspects of learning and practical wisdom that it seems unthinkable that the like of them could have been produced without divine assistance. Now, therefore, since we must follow the example of (our) ancestors who lived at the time of our master Moses, upon whom be peace, and of the elders who were assisted by the might of the Divine Presence and who lived at the time of the prophets, upon whom too be peace, and since there is no other way for our doing so except through the transmission of their teachings and their practices, generation after gene- ration; (since moreover) it is impossible that men like them 48 The concluding sentence, "Who ...

Moreover 50 they fixed (the text of) the Torah and (of) the rest of Scripture by means of accents and verse-ends, vowels and recitation-marks, and the Masorah, designating full and defective spellings, and going so far as to count up the number of the letters and words thereof, inasmuch as they knew, (for example), that the (letter) zw7zw of the word (Lev. II:42) go7ht5n is the central letter of the Torah, and therefore made it larger than all the other zwczws, or that the word (Lev. Io: I6) ddr5sh marks (the end of) the first half of the words of the Torah, whereas the (following) word dcrash marks (the beginning of) the second half. They also indicated the irregular use of (the vowels) qjmjns, patali, sere, and segol, and the dots which are placed over all or some letters of some words 51 in the Torah; they also determined the open and closed paragraphs and the inverted (letters) ni7n which are placed at (the end of) some paragraphs,52 recorded the words which are written in one way but are to be read in another way,53 and set down many similar categorical rules governing the written text and the reading (of Scrip-ture), the purpose of which we cannot fathom. This being so, how is it possible to say concerning them that they have spent so much labor upon the written text (of Scripture), and yet have neglected the meaning (of it), which is of greater extent, and the study of which is of prior and greater importance? Now 54 just as in the case of the bare Scrolls of Scripture, 50 Cf. Kh III, 31 (p. I80 f.) - 51 For example, Gen. I6:5, 18:9, 33:4. 52 For example, Nurm. I0:34, 36. 5 That is, the qerl and the ketib. 54 Cf. Kh III, 30 (p. i8o f.), 35 (p.

Therefore, just as we accept their authority regarding the reading of the (holy) text, even in cases where a word is written in one way and is read as if it were written in a different way, which is called ketib (and qeri), or in the case of the Ineffable Name which is read Ad5naii although not so written-even so ought we to acknowledge their authority in their pronouncements regarding the meaning of the Torah, of the rest of Scripture, and of the traditional ordinances which they call Oral Law, even when the (holy) text (seems to) swing toward a different interpretation. And just as amiong (Scriptural) laws there are categorical ordinances the reasons wherefor our minds are incapable of fathoming, so also among (Scriptural) passages from which laws may be derived (only by way of inference, there are some that are beyond our own comprehension). It is not for us to say that had God intended to convey a certain particular meaning He would have stated it so explicitly as to make interpretation unnecessary. Were the words of the (divine) revelation not categorical, it would have been permissible for us to substitute for them (clearer) words to the same effect, since either (set of words) would have conveyed the same meaning. It is our duty therefore to acknowledge the authority of the Sages (also) in regard to the meaning of the Torah. To accept their authority only in regard to the (written) words, and not in regard to their meaning, is thus a purely arbitrary procedure, which has no authority except untenable assumptions devoid of any foundation. When those who oppose the Sages in regard to the meaning of the Torah and of the rest of Scripture charge that their interpretations are improbable in the light of 2</page><page sequence="18">II4 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rational logic, (they should be asked) why they do not change 55 the word sidd in Lam. 4:I8tO stri, 5 or the word nafs1si in Ps. 24:4 to nafsh5, 57 inasmuch as these two words (as written) are also improbable in the light of reason. There are many (other Scriptural) words of such sort which they would have had to change (for the same reason). The community (of the Rabbanites) accepted all these (traditions) from a group of men whom they regard as having been supported by God, or from an individual posterior to the apostle Moses who was himself either a prophet or the equiva- lent of one. It is 58 extremely improbable that the nation of the Children of Israel at the time of the apostle Moses, upon whom be peace, notwithstanding their great number and the fact that for forty years they had been supplied with a sufficiency of provisions, clothing, and shelter, yet did not ask questions about the details of the laws which they had been commanded to observe in their entirety, nor request explana- tions of what was not clearly explained: moreover that they did not transmit (to succeeding generations) the decisions rendered by the apostle (Moses) and his detailed instructions in respect thereto. The same applies to the decisions rendered by the seventy elders, and also by the judges, the priests, and the later prophets during (the time of) the First Temple and thereafter. Now inasmuch as the total lack of such traditions is impossible or (at least highly) improbable, and since both adherents and opponents agree that no one but the Sages claims to have (preserved) these traditions, it is the foremost duty of anyone who exerts his judgment in seeking God's grace to acknowledge their authority in traditions regarding things which are not stated in Scripture in such a manner as 55 Cf.

This, then, is the safest course for him who seeks ultimate salvation and felicity. And may God, in his munificence and mercy, make us worthy and secure of them in both (earthly and heavenly) life. CHAPTER II Recording a portion of the charges brought by the Karaites against the Sages, together with the answers refuting these as well as other charges of theirs of similar nature. Be it known unto you, (O reader), that with the answers (given) here I do not aim to declare one view true and the other false. My intention is merely to remove the condem- nation of the Sages by showing that their teaching does not run counter to the dictates of (legitimate) judgment.59 The Karaites have in fact gone to such extremes in reviling the Sages, condeinning them, and heaping ridicule upon their sayings that they were led to regard the Sages and their followers as bereft of intelligence and guilty of (total) unbelief. They accuse them of contradicting many things expressly stated in Scripture, and they prefer (many other) charges against them which would take too long to explain in detail. I will, however, mention some of the best known of them, together with the answers thereto, so that they might serve as analogies to the others which I shall not mention. The charges of particular and general nature which I shall discuss are thirteen in number. [i. Charge:] They 60 say that notwithstanding God's com- mand in the Torah (Deut. I3 :i) Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it, the Sages have added (to it) many ordinances of their own making, such as the (regulations concerning the recital of the) Book of Esther on (the Feast of) Purim, the (celebration of the Feast of) Hanukkah, the recitation of the 59 On the technical meaning of ijtihdd see Enc. of Islam, s.v. 60 Cf. Kh III, 39-41 (p.

This, say the Karaites, is a grievously willful and obvious violation of the Torah which cannot be justified by (any kind of) exegesis and is undoubted- ly an act of (total) unbelief. Response thereto: Our legislation is tied to (the principle) 62 "A rule by Moses (received by him orally) from Mount Sinai," or (Deut. I7:IO) (received) from that place which the Lord shall choose; as it is written (Isa. 2:3) For out of Zion shall go forth the law, (meaning) through the agency 63 of judges, magistrates, priests, and (elders of) the Sanhedrin. Moreover the Torah (itself expressly) urges us to accept (legal traditions) from the prophets after Moses, upon whom be peace, e.g., (Deut. i8 :i8) I will raise them up a prophet ... (and I will put My words in his mouth), and the same also from priests and judges. We are (expressly) commanded to obey the judge authorized for each generation, as it is written in the Torah (Deut. I7:9) (And thou shalt come unto the Priests, the Levites), and unto the judge that shall be in those days; and thou shalt inquire ... and thou shalt do ... according to the law which they shall teach thee ... And the man that doeth presumptuously (in not hearkening unto the fpriest) ... that man shall die. This is followed by (Deut. I7:I2) And thou shalt exterminate the evil from thy midst. And all the people shall hear, and fear (God). This was the case so long as the (divinely appointed) order was intact, that is, (during the existence of) the (priestly) worship (at the Temple in Jerusa- lem), of the Sanhedrin, and of the other persons who kept the order in perfect shape and in direct contact with the divine 61 In H4ebrew cjrib, the symbolic rite enabling a person to extend his statutory private domain on the Sabbath, so as to permit some relaxation of the restrictive laws governing Sabbatical rest. 62 Peah 2:6, and passim, frequently; see above, note 28. 63 Literally "in the presence".</page><page sequence="21">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY II7 command, whether this contact was effected by way of (direct) prophecy or by way of (indirect divine) support and inspira- tion. It is for this reason that the aforementioned (oral) laws are obligatory, and it is therefore permissible to say in the accompanying benediction "who has commanded us (to do thus and so)." Were these (laws) merely usages originated after the exile, they would not have been called ordinances and would have required no benediction, but would have been designiated as mere enactments or customs. In fact the Karaites (themselves) have introduced for their own use a nrumber of laws which are not expressly stated in the Torah, but have been deduced by them from the (holy) text by way of analogy, and have been arbitrarily laid down on the basis of their own reasoning. (The command) Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it is therefore merely a prohibition of willfully modifying the divine laws solely on the basis of one's own judgment, or else it is a prohibition of following a law which purports to supersede a Scriptural law, whether its ordinances and instructions are more or less numerous than those of the law in the Torah. These two alternative interpretations (of this command) are preferable to the interpretation accepted by the Karaites. The aforementioned laws in wlhich the Rabba- nites are supposed to have violated (the command) Thou shalt not add are really not additions to the ordinances of the Torah but rather come under the ordinance of (according to) the law which they shall teach thee, as explained above. The priests and judges, from that place which the Lord shall choose, could not have agreed upon anything contrary to the (divine) law, because of their great learning, both inherited (from their predecessors) and acquired (by their own efforts), and because they were (directly) aided by the Divine Presence, especially since they were but recently detached from (direct) contact with prophecy or with the "Daughter of the Voice (of God)," 64 64 In Hebrew bat qol, the heavenly voice which is said to have occasionally resounded fromn above, conveying God's decree. Cf. B. Yorna gb, Sotah 48b.</page><page sequence="22">II8 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and other phenomena which replaced it, according to what is well known about the Sages. It is thus clear that the Sages did not act on their own, except where the law of the Torah permitted them to do so. We therefore cannot concede that they were guilty even of error, on the basis of what the Karaites have menltioned (about them), much less of (total) unbelief, such as consists of obvious violation of the Torah, as alleged by the Karaites. The Karaites (themselves) cannot deny that some laws were enacted after Moses, upon whom be peace, and were retained in force thereafter, e.g., the action of Solomon who (i Kings 8:64) did hallow the middle of the (Temple-)court and offered sacrifices and burnt offerings in a place other than the altar, and held the feast (i Kings 8:65) seven days and seven days; 65 or the arrangements made by Samuel and David relating to the order of the singers in the Temple,66 which likewise remained in force; or what Solomoln had done concerning the Tabernacle, omitting part of what Moses had done concerning it in the desert; 67 or Ezra's imposition of (a tax of) (Neh. IO:33) the third part of a shekel 68 upon the people (of the time) of the Second Temple; or their building a stone partition (in the Second Temple) on the site of the Ark and hanging a curtain before it, inasmuch as they knew that the Ark had been buried there.69 All these are additions (to Scriptural law). 65 That is, fourteen days, instead of the statutory seven. Both actions do not accord with Scriptural law. 66 Cf. i Chron. 9:22, I5:I6 f.; 2 Chron. 5:12 f. Samuel and David are said to have divided the Levites into twenty-four divisions, each of which served at the Temple for one week (Maimonides, Hilkot kele ha-Miqdash, iii, 9). 67 The Tabernacle is said to have been hidden upon the erection of Solomnon's Temple, and of its conmponents and appurtenances only the table and the candelabrum were retained in use (Tos. Sotah 13). 68 According to Ibn Ezra, ad loc., this was an additional tax, over and above the Scripturally imposed tax of half a shekel. Others regard the two as identical, in different coinages. 69 The Ark of the Covenant is said to have vanished some time before the Second Temple was built. Cf. Sheq. 6:2, and Maimonides, Hilk5t Bit ha-Behirah, iv, i.</page><page sequence="23">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY II9 Now just as the Karaites do not consider these (additions) contrary to the text of the Torah, so should they also not regard the enactments of the Sages as contrary thereto, especially since we have already explained that they are (directly) connected with the divine command. In fact there are passages in Scripture which expressly state that some laws introduced after the revelation of the Torah were to continue in force, e.g., in the story of (the Feast of) Purim in the Book of Esther (9:27), where it is written The Jews ordained, aond took upon them, and upon their seed ... (that they would keep these two days); and further on (9:3I) As they had ordained for themselves, aond for their seed. There are other passages in this same book indicating that these laws were to be obligatory forever after. [2. Charge:] The Karaites 70 accuse them of interpreting (Lev. 23:I5) (And ye shall count ...) from the morrow of the Sabbath (... seven Sabbaths ...) even unto the morrow of the Sabbath in a way contrary to the explicit meaning (of the holy text).71 Response thereto: Your claim that this (ordinance) cannot support any interpretation other than your own of counting from Sunday to Sunday, is absurd. For it is legitimate for the word "Sabbath" to be used in the sense of "week," in the manner of calling a thing by its main component,72 which is the way Onkelos the Proselyte has translated (this term) in his Targum.73 This is a metaphorical figure of speech, such as is often used (also) in Arabic and in other languages. In fact nowadays many of the (Muslim) people in Syria, North Africa, and elsewhere use the word "Friday" in the sense of "week," inasmuch as this day is the chief day of the week among the 70 Cf. Kh III, 4I (p. I92 f.). 71 The Karaites deduce from these verses that the Feast of Pentecost must always fall on a Sunday, contrary to Rabbanite law which here interprets "Sabbath" as meaning the first day of Passover, and "Sabbaths" as meaning weeks. 72 That is, using the rhetorical figure of parys pro toto. 73 The Aramaic translation of the Torah ascribed to Onkelos, ad loc.</page><page sequence="24">I20 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Muslims. This is especially true seeing that the Torah itself says (Deut. I6:9) Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; from the time the sickle is first Put to the standing corn; it is evident that (the determination of) the time the sickle is first put is left to our own judgment.74 It is legitimate therefore (to assume) that one of the priests, or one of the judges, or one of the pious kings,75 in agreement with the Sanhedrin and other Sages, decided that the purpose of this counting was to insti- tute (an interval of) fifty days between the first fruits of the barley harvest and the first fruits of the wheat harvest,76 thereby observing (the count of) seven weeks, i.e. (Lev. 23:I5) seven Sabbaths, complete. He therefore ruled that the beginning of this (count) was to take place on the second day of Passover. Thus there is in this no contradiction with the Torah, and the observance of this (interpretation) is obligatory because it has come from that place which the Lord shall choose, in accordance with the conditions mentioned above, or perchance has been revealed (directly) from God. This interpretation is therefore not absurd. To be sure, it is possible that the sense of the (holy) text is indeed that the count must run from Sunday to Sunday, but even so it cannot mean to make this (particular day) obligatory (forever); rather is Sunday used as an example, as is shown by the (parallel) seven weeks. That is to say, if the count happens to begin on a Sunday, it is to end on a Sunday, meaning that if it happens to begin on a Monday or on any other day, (it is to run) to the same day (seven weeks hence). It is not improbable that when this ordinance was (first) promulgated there was something in colnnection with it which indicated (that the 74 That is, the moryow of the Sabbath is parallel to the time the sickle is first put; therefore "Sabbath" cannot refer to an actual Sabbath day, since it is absurd to assume that corn harvest always began on a Sunday-grain does not ripen on exactly the same day year after year. 75 Literally "one of the better kings", since some of themn worshiped heathen divinities. 76 That is, between Passover and Pentecost, which respectively mark these harvests.</page><page sequence="25">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I2I ordinance had) this particular meaning,77 especially since we find many other instances of such usage in the Torah, e.g. (Exod. 23:5) If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden ... (thou shalt surely release it), where the meaning is not restricted to the ass, but assistance in general is meant, with regard to every (sort of) difficulty and every (kind of) animal. The Karaites, too, accept this (extended interpreta- tion of the latter verse), inasmuch as the logical connection leads to it. It is not improbable that the problem we are discussing is of the same type, except that here the connection (with Sunday) applied specifically to the time when this ordinance was promulgated, and not (to every year) in general. If these possible interpretations are not to be judged inferior from the point of view (of the wording) of the (holy) text, the defeat of the (Karaites') condemnation is evident. If they are to be judged inferior from the point of view of the bare (wording of the holy) text, they nevertheless cannot be considered inferior if we bear in mind the consensus of absolutely all of these scholars with regard to them, and the absence of any evident worldly motive that could have prompted them to (adopt) these (interpretations). Indeed, were we to say that they are superior for this very reason (alone), it would not be far from the truth. Should the Karaites reinforce -their own interpretation (of this ordinance) by pointing out that the Torah fixes all holidays on specific days of the inonth, excepting only the Feast of Pentecost, whose precise date is not fixed, and that if the count were to begin, as the Rabbanites think, on the second day of Passover, the Feast of Pentecost would invariably fall on the sixth day of (the month of) Siwan, in accordance with the requirements of the Rabbanite calendar,78 we would 77 That is, the second day of Passover may have happened to fall on a Sunday in that particular year, and the people were informed that the same principle was to be observed in future years. 78 In which case the Torah would have specified this date, as it has done for all the other festivals.</page><page sequence="26">I22 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW reply, This does not reinforce your view, since the fixing of the first day of a month depends upon the observation of the new moon, and the reliance upon (the result of) this observa- tion takes precedence (in determining the date of Pentecost); therefore the day on which Pentecost falls cannot be constant, based as it is on the count from the second day of Passover, inasmuch as the months (of Iyyar and Siwan) may be either complete or incomplete.79 Any fairminded person examining what I have just said will realize that the Karaites' view in this matter cannot be relied upon and followed, which is all that we wanted to prove. [D. Charge:] Another well-known claim of theirs is that the Sages have obviously and willfully erred in their interpretation of (Lev. 24:20) eye for eye, etc., for the Sages prescribe a monetary fine in such cases, whereas the wording of the (holy) text demands retaliation, whereby what the transgressor had done to this victim must be done unto him also. Response thereto: 80 It is not impossible that the meaning of this (holy) text should indeed be the exaction of a monetary fine, even if it may seem unlikely, for such obscure expressions are common in the usage of the Hebrew language. Especially since it is written immediately after 8 this (Lev. 24:i8) And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life, which must signify a fine, for the expression life for life must mean not "whosoever killed thy beast, kill thou his beast," but rather "take thou his beast." It is possible therefore that the expression eye for eye, etc., is to be interpreted in the same manner, by virtue of a connection which is not expressly stated, but which was known at the time of the promulgation (of this ordinance); or else the apostle (Moses) had stated it in the Oral Law. For just as there is no useful purpose, except 79 That is, may consist of either 29 or 30 days, as tlhie case may be. 80 Cf. Kh III, 46-47 (p. I94 ft.). Karaite law rejects this Rabbanite abolition of the jus talionis. 81 Rather immediately before this; Kh (I94, 2o) and KhH make the same mistake, evidently due to quotation from rmemory.</page><page sequence="27">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I23 (mere) satisfaction, in killing the (transgressor's) beast, so also he who, for example, had his arm cut off can derive no useful compensation from cutting off the arm of his assailant, except (mere) satisfaction. It is therefore more useful, humane, and God-fearing to exact a monetary fine for the arm. This interpretation, however, although possible, is yet remote, and cannot be easily accepted by the mind of the interpreter. It is preferable therefore to reason thus: Perhaps the Torah has specified retaliation because it is the basic law. It behooves the victim, however, to turn away from it and to accept a monetary fine ilnstead, or else to forgive and waive all compensation altogether. Those, then, whose decisions flowed from that place which the Lord shall choose considered the verse (Lev. 24:2o) As he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him., and the fact that it(s application) is abhorrent in a case like eye for eye, seeing that one man may die of this kind of injury while another man may not, and that the man guilty of having put out another man's eye may himself happen to be one-eyed, and would thus be blinded completely if his remain- ing eye were to be put out (in retaliation). They therefore came to the conclusion that for this reason (the punishment) should be commuted to a fine, especially as this is also more useful for the victim, as we have explained above. They did not however, prohibit thereby retaliation in case of (loss of) life, since there the aforementioned objections do not apply. There is consequently no contradiction with the (holy) text in accepting a fine for (the loss of) anything less than life, for there is nothing in the (holy) text to indicate expressly that retaliation is compulsory (also) in (cases of loss of) limbs and (infliction of) wounds, or to forbid either the victim or the judges in his time to forgive the assailant in exchange for, or without, compensation. Rather the utmost that this ordinance indicates is that retaliation is permissible (but not always compulsory), so that if the victim is prevented from exercising it, he is prevented from doing something permissible, and not something obligatory. This prohibition (of retaliation) is thus</page><page sequence="28">I24 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW not an (unauthorized) addition to the prohibitions mentioned in the Torah, but comes rather under the head of according to the lazw w)hich they shall teach thee, as has been explained above; there is no need to go into this at great length (again). The Karaites (themselves) do not deny that one may (sometimes) do something forbidden or neglect to do some- thing obligatory, as a precaution against risk (of more grievous sin), such as profane the Sabbath or eat food on the Day of Atonement. Why then do they deny it here? 82 Should they say that if it were permissible to abrogate permanently what the (holy) text requires, the (holy) text would become useless, we would reply, Why is it not permissible that the usefulness (of the holy text) should consist in indicating the basic rule, excepting where there are reasons against (the application of) it, and in showing that the fine is a substitute, and not the basic (pulnishment). After all, the Sages did not abolish retaliation entirely; on the contrary, they permitted it where the common good demands it as a matter of policy and (public) restraint, whether it involves (loss of) life, or (loss of) limbs, or (infliction of) wounds.83 Thus the Karaites' condemnation stands refuted. [4. Charge:] They claim that the Sages contradict the (holy) text also in their abolition of the precautions against (the contraction of) ritual uncleanness, notwithstanding that the Torah expressly makes such precautions mandatory. Yet the Sages do not require them, and even go so far as to assert that during the time of (Israel's) Dispersion nothing whatsoever, whether solid or liquid, can become ritually unclean by coming 82 Here there is the grave risk of the assailant's constitution being unable to withstand the loss of a limb in punishment for his crimne. Should he then die, his victim or his judges would be technically guilty of murder. 83 The principle still applies, in theory, to nmurder, and to perjury resulting in the conviction for murder of an innocent person. The mnatter is rather academic, since Rabbanite law forbids all capital punishment in the Dispersion, and the Sages in general held the death penalty in great abhorrence.</page><page sequence="29">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I25 in contact with a menstruating woman. Such Rabbanites in our time as do recognize such uncleanness, merely follow in this matter the opinion of the Karaites, and not that of the Sages, although they do not realize it. Response thereto: 84 The Hebrew word denoting un- cleanness, namely tumnilh, is used in three (different) senses. (First), it is used to denote disobedience to, or violation of, a command relating to deed or thought; (secondly), to denote (natural) excretions, such as faeces and urine; (thirdly), to denote imaginary uncleanness, i.e., (the result of) touching (unclean persons or objects), or carrying them, or being under the same roof with them. The uncleanness (communicated) by a dead body, a menstruating woman, or a delivered woman comes under this third (variety of) meaning. In cases of this sort of uncleanness a person is forbidden to approach sacred things connected with God, e.g., the priests, their food and wearing apparel, the oblations, the sacrifices, the Temple, and many other things of the same nature, most of which are dependent upon the Divine Presence being in residence (in the midst of Israel). At present, however, the Divine Presence no longer dwells in our midst,85 which is why in our time the ordinances concerning uncleanness are no longer in force. We still observe the prohibition of sexual intercourse with women having menses or issues, or (recently) delivered, not because of (the danger of contracting) uncleanness, but only because this is a separate law commanded by God.8" Likewise, a man is forbidden to have meals with his wife and to spend much time in close proximity to her while she is menstruating, merely as a "fence," in order that this (intimacy) might not lead to sexual intercourse with her. Of the same nature is the prohibi- tion of (eating) nebilih,87 which is due not to (fear of) un- 84 Cf. Kh III, 49 (P. I96 ff.); Mainmonides, Guide, III, 47 (ed.

Ber. 22b) "Ezra established the rule that men must bathe after nocturnal pollution," such an ablution would have been obligatory not as a matter of law 89 (but merely as a matter of hygiene). Uncleanness of the two other varieties is governed by different rules. Thus, contact with (natural) excretions requires abstention from reciting prayers and carrying (holy) books, and puriflcation from this variety of uncleanness is brought about simply by its removal with water, or with any other cleansing agent, whereas uncleanness caused by contact with the dead does not require abstention from touching (holy) books or reciting prayers, and a person afflicted with it may not approach any holy thing 90 until he has purified himself with the ashes of the heifer immolated especially for this purpose, solely because this is so categorically prescribed in Scripture.9" Thus each variety of uncleanness is governed by its own rules. There is no need, however, to mention them (all here). [5. Charge:] They condemn the Sages also because, by way of the device of "mingling", they have permitted on the Sabbath some things that are (really) forbidden, and this is obviously a vile and despicable device. Response thereto: 92 They did not permit thereby anything prohibited (by the Torah). On the contrary, they built "fences" around the Torah, making them obligatory on the basis of the statement (Lev. i8 :30) Therefore shall ye keep My charge, which they understood as meaning "shall ye make a safeguard for My charge". Compare their wellknown tradition 88 Lev. II:39 f.; Deut. I4:21. '9 The Scriptural ordinance concerning ablution after nocturnal pollution (Lev. 15:I6; Deut. 23:11-12) is no longer obligatory, accord- ing to Rabbanite law, as it is taken to refer only to contact with holy objects, whiclh are nonexistent in the Dispersion. Cf. B. BQ 82b. 90 That is, the priests and their food and clothing, etc., as mnentioned above. 91 Nurm. I 9. 92 Cf. Kh III, 51 if. (P. 200 if.).</page><page sequence="31">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I27 (Ab. I:2) "And build ye a fence around the Torah". This fence may be likened to the binding of a book which protects it from any external injury; if any such injury occurs, the damage is all to the binding, and not to the body (of the book), and the fence is thus intended not for its own sake, but only as a means of safeguarding that body. Now one of the fences built by the Sages is their prohibition of carrying anything from a private domain into a public domain, or vice versa, on the Sabbath. This prohibition is not formulated in the Torah, [but neither was it enacted] for its own sake, i.e., to serve as any- thing other than a fence. They thereupon adopted a lenient policy in regard to this fence, in order that (the product of) their own judgment should not be taken to be as (absolutely binding as divine) law, and in order to permit the people some freedom in moving about (on the Sabbath). The people, however, may not partake of this (freedom) without the permission which is conferred by the rite of ,,mingling", in order that the difference between the absolutely permitted, the fence, and the forbidden might remain evident. Thus the Karaites' charge of a vile and despicable device is groundless, since many legal matters may be converted from prohibited to permitted, or vice versa, by similar means, or even by no more than bare formulae, e.g., the lawful acquisition of money, property, wife, or slave, as well as divorce, manumission, and many other things too numerous for detailed specification.93 Moreover the Sages may have borrowed the practice of "mingling" from the niche of prophecy. Those who have transmitted such traditions were not just a few but many, and were also scholars in direct contact with the prophets. Even if they were no more than the priests, the Levites, and the seventy elders who were the bearers of the Torah and were 93 That is, money, property, or slaves cannot be lawfully acquired without a formal act of acquisition (by purchase or inheritance); a wife cannot be acquired without a formal act of marriage; and a wife or a slave cannot be released from, respectively, marriage or bondage without a formal act of divorce or manurnission. All these acts consist in part of mere spoken formulae.</page><page sequence="32">I28 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW in constant attendance upon our master Moses, upon whom be peace, this is enough (to establish their authority and trust- worthiness). [6. Charge:] The Karaites say that the Sages violated the explicit comniand of the Torah (Exod. 35:3) Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day, and not only permitted it but made it a duty and a commandment requiring the benediction "Who has sanctified us with His ordinances and has commanded us to kindle the Sabbath lamp".94 They say that this is obvious disobedience of the Torah. Response thereto: This (custom of lighting the Sabbath lamp) does not constitute contradiction of the Torah, much less disobedience to it. For they prescribed the lighting (of the lamp at dusk on Friday) for the sake of the (incoming) Sabbath, (and not on the Sabbath itself), as they have expli- citly stated in the benediction quoted above.95 As for lighting (it) on the Sabbath (itself), they, too, forbid it. The wording of the (holy) text forbids the lighting on the Sabbath, not for the sake of the Sabbath, and the difference between these two things is quite clear. Should the Karaites say, Nay, the (holy) text forbids what the Sages require, i.e., the lighting (of the lamp) for the sake of the Sabbath, and it is this which is to be understood from the (holy) text, just as in the verse 96 (Lev. 23:40) And ye shall take you on the first day, etc., both you and we agree that the taking is meant for the sake of that day, and not on it; therefore the same applies to (the expres- sion) upon the Sabbath day, we would reply, What you say, even if it is possible or even quicker (to occur) to one's mind, yet represents a metaphorical interpretation, whereas what we go by is the literal meaning of the words (of the holy text), and 94 B. Shab. 25b, and Tosafot, ad loc. 95 Benedictions are pronounced prior to the act involved, hence the term "Sabbath lamp" implies that the lamp was lighted prior to the onset of the Sabbath. 96 Referring to the palm branches, etc., to be used in the building of the booth for the Feast of Tabernacles.</page><page sequence="33">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I29 the interpretation of the (holy) text according to its literal meaning is preferable and not inferior to its interpretation by way of the metaphor, so long as such (literal) interpretation does not lead to any objectionable conclusion. Thus their requirement of this (Sabbath lamp) and of the benediction "with His ordinances ... and has commanded us" is of the same nature as (their institution of the Feast of) Hanukkah, of the recital of the Book of Esther (on the Feast of Purim), and of similar matters. We have already explained this above, and there is no need to repeat it. L7. Charge:] Another matter in which, according to the Karaites, the Sages contradict the text of the Torah, is the prohibition of having sexual intercourse with one's wife on the Sabbath, inasmuch as it is a holy day, as stated in the Torah,97 and sanctification demands abstention from women, in the sense of refraining from sexual contact with them, as is set forth in the directive 98 (given) to Israel at the time when they were preparing themselves for the revelation at Mount Sinai. Response thereto: This prohibition (of yours) contradicts your own permission of drinking wine on the Sabbath day, notwithstanding that (Num. 6:5) holy is used (also) with reference to the Nazirite, because he is obligated to abstain from drinking wine. If, therefore, the fact that those who stood by at Mount Sinai were called holy implies the (perma- nent) prohibition of sexual intercourse on the Sabbath, the fact that the Nazirites, who are obligated to abstain from drinking wine, are also called holy must imply the (perma- nent) prohibition of drinking wine on the Sabbath. If the latter is not obligatory, neither is the former; or if the latter is so, so is the former. Whatever they say about the difference between these two matters is invariably untenable. Sanctifica- tion does indeed mean abstention, but it varies according to 97 For example, Exod. 20:8 (Fourth Commandment). 98 Exod. I9:I4-I5. The translation of haqq is tentative. Perhaps the word is a misreading of a hasty naskhi khabar, "in the account of Israel". Rabbanite law permits sexual intercourse on the Sabbath. 3</page><page sequence="34">I30 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the thing abstained from, and by no means does it follow that abstention from one thing implies abstention from every- thing.99 [8. Charge:] Another thing vehemently condemned by the Karaites as a sinful error is the fact that the Sages fixed the beginnings of months and (the dates of) holidays by mathe- matical calendation, the result of which is sometimes earlier and sometimes later than the pQssible visual observation (of the new moon); and although originally they had depended upon visual observation, they subsequently turned from it to the aforementioned calculation, thus willfully overruling the (Scriptural) law on their own authority. Not satisfied with this, they also made the holidays and some of the beginnings of months two days long, to allow for (supposed) doubts, with the sole exception of the Day of Atonement, which they restricted to one day because of the (physical )impossibility of fasting for two days without a break. Moreover, in the case of the postponements,100 they have willfully modified (the law) on the ground of weak considerations which cannot possibly justify postponing holidays fixed by God (Himself) on specific days of months. The Karaites have much to say in condemna- tion of this (procedure). Response thereto: 101 There is nothing in the Torah to indicate that we must rely in (the fixing of the beginnings of) months upon visual observation (of the new moon) alone. Indeed the Torah does not even say whether the legal month is to be (reckoned) from conjunction (of the moon with the sun) to conjunction, or from opposition to opposition, or from 99 The final sentence of this paragraph seems to be somewhat awk- wardly worded. The meaning evidently is that sanctification varies according to the person and the occasion for which it is prescribed, and that the fact that a certain person on a certain occasion was obligated to abstain from something does not prove that other persons on other occasions must forever after do the same. 100 The Rabbanite calendar rule which states that if certain holidays happen to fall on certain days of the week, they must be postponed. 101 Cf. Kh III, 35, 38 (p. i82 ff.).</page><page sequence="35">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I3I the first moment of the appearance (of one new moon) to the first moment of the appearance (of another), or from one phase of the moon to another and similar phase. From the (mere) wording of the verse (Exod. I2 :2) This month (of Nisin shall be unto you the beginning of months) we do not know whether it is a solar or a lunar month, or whether it is a Chaldean, a Syrian, a Coptic,102 or any other kind of month. Why then is it unreasonable that the determination of the beginnings of months should have been entrusted to those of whom it is written according to the law which they shall teach thee? Now when at one time they had thought it best to use visual observation, they did so. When at another time (later on) they decided to follow the procedure which we use now, and which consists of the aforementioned mathematical calenda- tion and postponements, they again did so. In doing this they neither ran counter to the wording of the (holy) text, nor did they extend the lunar month beyond its natural length, namely, thirty days for some months, and twenty-nine for others. If, therefore, they were entrusted with the fixing of the beginning of the (civil) year, including the addition (in a leap- year) of a second month of Adar, in conformity with (Deut. i6:i) Observe the month of fresh ears (of corn)-in this the Karaite practice follows the Rabbanite one, as required by the order of calendation devised by the Rabbanites, although it was not originally so devised in Scripture-why then is it un- reasonable that they should have been entrusted also with the determination of the beginnings of months, especially as the difference in the yearly intercalation amoulnts to a (whole) month, whereas in the postponements it amounts only to a day or two? How can a person who does not know whether he is to observe the Fast of Atonement in (the month of) Tishri, 102 The Clhaldean calendar was used by the patriarch Abraham before he emigrated to the land of Canaan.; the Coptic (Egyptian) calendar was used by the Israelites during their sojourn in Egypt; the Syrian calendar was used in the land of Canaan when it was conquered by the Israelites.</page><page sequence="36">I32 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW or Eluil, or Marheshwdn,103 blame another person for not knowing whether he is to fast on the tenth, or the ninth, or the eleventh of Tishri ? 104 The truth (of the matter) is that the beginnings of month and year are conventional dates, and not the real dates (when month or year actually begin), even if they were to be fixed by visual observation (of the new moon), for it might happen that observation might be delayed after its proper time by reason of clouds, or the like, or the new moon might be observed prematurely, since months are not of (exactly) the same length. Therefore (Scriptural) law requires us to follow the example of those whose decisions have come from that place which the Lord shall choose, and it is not for us to contradict them now. As for their making the beginnings of some months, and the holidays-excepting (the Fast of) Atonement-(when observed) outside of the Land of Israel, two days long, this is a rule instituted by the Sages. They established it in accordance with what used to be done in olden times because of doubts (as to the exact day of the new moon), and these doubts are thus not of recent date and of our own time. Therefore the new moons and holidays as fixed by them are in fact the true legal new moons and holidays, beyond any doubt, since, as explained above, this matter had been entrusted to their judgment. As for their adding a second day to holidays and requiring the recital of the new moon prayer on the thirtieth day of the (preceding) full month, this does not constitute a violation of Thou shalt not add thereto, as we have already repeatedly explained before. [9. Charge:] Another Karaite charge of contradicting the wording of the (holy) text refers to the Sages' permission of 103 That is, whether he ought to observe the Fast of Atonement a month earlier or a month later, depending upon whether the preceding year is a regular year or a leap-year; the person is presumed to reject the Rabbanite method of intercalation. 104 That is, whether the Fast of Atonement will be regular, or a day early, or a day late, depending on whether the beginning of that month is or is not moved one day forward or backward.</page><page sequence="37">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I33 eating the fat-tail,105 although the Torah explicitly classes it with fat, as it is written (Lev. 3:9) The fat thereof, the fat-tail entire. Thus this verse speaks (first) of fat in general, and then mentions the fat-tail, etc., in particular. Now since all fat is forbidden, as it is written (Lev. 3:I7) Ye shall eat neitler fat nor blood, and in another place (Lev. 7:23) Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheet, or goat, the fat-tail necessarily comes under this prohibition, beyond any doubt. Consequently making it permissible is open and willful rebellion against what is required by the (holy) text, in which there is no room for personal judgment, and undoubtedly constitutes a denial of (the authority of Scriptural) law. Response thereto: This would indeed be willful rebellion, if there were no other possible interpretation of it than the one you mention, namely, that the word "fat" is sometimes used in a sense including the fat-tail and sometimes in a sense excluding it. A similar instance inr the Hebrew language is the word "day", which sometimes includes also the night and sometimes excludes it and refers only to the daytime. There are many words of this type in Hebrew and in other languages. Indeed this word is also used in a different sense, as in (the expression) "that fat of the land", etc. Our Sages must therefore have known, from a tradition current among them, that in the verse prohibiting all fat the word "fat" was used in its common meaning which does not include the fat-tail. This (interpretation) must have been generally accepted among them, since there is no mention in their sayings of any dis- agreement about it. Thus the permission of the fat-tail was based either upon uninterrupted tradition or upon the con- sensus (of the Sages) who considered it as equivalent to un- interrupted tradition. Furthermore Abraham ibn Ezra,106 in his commentary on the Torah,107 says that he had a disputation about this problem 105 B. Hul. 117a. 106 The well-known exegetist and poet (12th century). 107 On Lev. 7:20.</page><page sequence="38">I34 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW with a certain Karaite, and had used a line of argument different from the one cited above. Namely, he would not at all grant that the Torah had forbidden the eating of any fat (whatsoever); rather the forbidden fat was solely that (Lev. 27:9) of the beast whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord,'08 so that no other fat was actually forbidden. He granted, however, that the fat-tail is part of the fat referred to in the verse Ye shall eat no fat. He says further that this Karaite was unable to refute this argument from the text of the Torah, but merely asked him, If (all) fat is not prohibited by the Torah, on what ground do the Rabbanites forbid it? To which Ibn Ezra replied that they prohibited it on the authority of the Sages, and not on that of the Torah. This argument may be allowed in (the heat of) a disputation, but not in the course of a (careful) perusal of the sayings of the Sages. For their sayings, as they stand, (clearly) imply that the prohibition of fat, excluding the fat-tail, is based on the Torah, and is not an enactment of the Sages, even though all their enactments go back to the Torah, as has been shown before. Therefore my own explanation, as given above, is preferable and more logical. In fact the (holy) text itself points to it by the ex- pression the fat thereof, the fat-tail (entire); for were it not for the fact that the word "fat" can be used in a sense excluding the fat-tail and its appendages, there would be no advantage in thus specifying (the fat-tail after having mentioned fat in general), except for mere emphasis, and according to our explanation (the fat-tail is specified) both for emphasis and for the purpose of eliminating (all) verbal ambiguity. This explanation is therefore preferable in interpreting the meaning of the (holy) text. [io. Charge:] Another Karaite charge of contradicting the Torah refers to the verse (Deut. 25:3) Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, etc. Yet the Sages do not allow giving more than thirty-nine lashes, and 108 Inexact quotation.</page><page sequence="39">IBN KAMMUNAH'S TREATISE-NEMOY I35 permit the reduction of the number down to one, depending upon a conjectural estimate of the endurance of the person to be whipped, lest a greater number of lashes should result in danger (to life).109 This, say the Karaites, is a clear violation of the (holy) text. Response thereto: Whosoever examines the (holy) text will admit that its purpose is, not to require the (full number of) forty (lashes) but to forbid any excess over forty, whenever punishment by flogging is required. Therefore the meaning of the (holy) text must be that such excess is forbidden, and that the highest permissible number of lashes is forty, any amount above forty being prohibited. Should it be asked, If it be permissible to inflict (a full) forty lashes, why did the Sages prevent (us) from reaching that number by deducting one lash from it?, we would reply, They did this so that this might serve as a "fence", and prevent any excess over the forty ordained in the (holy) text, which might be caused by a mistake in the count (of the lashes), for in most instances, if an error occurs in such a count, it amounts to no more than one (lash). Indeed even an error of one (lash) is uncommon, and an error of more than one is such a rarity that it need not be provided for in building the "fence" implied in the verse (Lev. i8 :30) Therefore shall ye keep My charge. I have already explained above the Rabbanites' sayings regarding this matter. rII. Charge:] Another Karaite charge of willfulness in interpreting the (holy) text refers to the saying of the Sages that the verse (Exod. 23:I9) 110 Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk means "thou shalt not eat meat and milk together",111 and this interpretation is given also in the Tar- gum. Yet, (say the Karaites), it unquestionably constitutes an additional prohibition not intended by the (holy) text.
