<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT ITALIAN OPERAS By GUIDO M. GATTI N AN OPEN LETTER to the writer of this article, published in the January I936 number of the "Rassegna Musicale," Ildebrando Pizzetti deplores the situation that has arisen in Italy concerning composers of opera. According to Pizzetti, this unfortunate situation, which at present shows no sign of improvement, may well lead within a short time to stagnation in operatic production. Pizzetti laments particularly the scant support, and the equally scant respect, rendered by the large Italian opera- houses to the new works of native composers. Three or at the most four performances are assigned, before the season begins, to each opera newly composed or freshly added to the repertoire of this or that theater.... this means that-given the custom which obtains in all the important theaters, of dividing the most devoted frequenters, the subscribers, into two or more groups-even the best disposed spectator will hear a new opera only once! Further- more, even if the opera, from the opening night, has the greatest success, the number of performances will not be increased from three to five, let us say, or from four to seven or eight. The letter raises objections also to the attitude of the critics and of the younger elements. It may be that its contents reflect an excessive pessimism. Nevertheless, the conditions decried by Pizzetti really exist. If they have not as yet had a detrimental effect on operatic production which, as we shall see, is still significant both in quantity and quality, who can assure us that, if they continue, their consequences will not make themselves felt in the creative field? This, then, is the question that Pizzetti asks himself: Who can assert that within a few years young Italian musicians, particularly those who have yet to reach their thirties, will not abandon the theater altogether and confine their activities to concert productions, and probably the radio? It has often been said that lyric opera no longer fills the needs of the day, that the taste for opera is definitely on the decline. This asser- tion, however, is not borne out by facts (certainly not in Italy, nor even in other countries). Now, it is precisely the operas of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century repertoire that appeal to the largest public, that is, those operas that reflect the taste farthest removed from our present one. The reason is that the idiom of these operas is well understood by 77</page><page sequence="2">78 The Musical Quarterly the public, which does not have to make any effort to grasp its meaning. The spectator of today is born with the heritage of a complete operatic tradition. He feels at home with it, recognizing, with the aid of aural memory, localities and persons, and experiencing therefore the feeling of having mastered the tradition. In the face of new operas, however, the more original and individual the manner of expression, the greater the confusion on the part of the spectator. Not encountering the ex- pected sign-posts, which would help him in orienting himself, he de- clares the opera incomprehensible and bizarre-the fruit of artistic con- ceptions both monstrous and immature. Was it not thus with many operas of the past ? And, without referring to such classic examples as Norma or La Traviata, could we not cite Puccini's La Bohbme, the first performance of which, at the Teatro Regio in Turin in I896, pleased scarcely anyone? Did not someone write that its career would be con- fined within the walls of the city? Pizzetti continues: "If, at the time, La Bohbme had been accorded the three performances which are cus- tomarily given to all new operas now, it too would have faded into oblivion." But the opera received twelve performances. Gradually the public became interested in it, understood it, and then loved it, finally pronouncing it the success we all now know it to be. In passing from the hypothetical to the actual, however, we must admit that, so far, Italian operatic production seems not to have been affected by the situation Pizzetti deplores. The renewal of energy and ardor which in Italy is encountered in all forms of activity, practical and artistic, is evident even in the special field of opera. One need only glance over the chronicles of the lyric theaters to be convinced. All the big names in contemporary Italian music are to be found on the bill- boards of those theaters. In the last five years, besides new operas by Mascagni, Giordano, and Wolf-Ferrari, we have had others by Pizzetti, Respighi, Zandonai, Alfano, Malipiero, Casella, Rocca, Lualdi, Veretti, Rieti, Guerrini, and Mortari, just to mention a few. It seems that, with an array of such important names, we cannot very well speak of a crisis, especially when we keep in mind the value and significance of these operas, some of which we shall discuss more or less fully. Although Pizzetti writes that the way of opera is dark and beset with thorns for the musician, he does not on that account abandon it, even if</page><page sequence="3">Recent Italian Operas 79 other paths are, or may appear to him, easier and brighter. Thus, the reverberations of the success of Orsholo at Florence (May 5, 1935), and at Milan and Rome (season of 1935-36) have not yet spent themselves; and he is already working on a new drama of crowds and contemporary passions, a drama in which greed and love are pitted against each other. Ors~olo, on the other hand, is a Venetian drama of the seventeenth cen- tury. It has, as its background, Venice, neither in its period of splendor nor during the voluptuous decadence of the eighteenth century, but in the days that followed the war in Crete and the Morea and marked the beginning of the crisis, the slow waning of the supremacy of the aristo- crats-of power concentrated in the hands of one class--, and the ap- pearance of other elements claiming the right of self-government. From this trenchant and somber historical drama emerges the more intimate drama of a few characters, with its clash of unbending wills equally intent on fighting to the bitter end. The characters of Pizzetti's operas, from Fedra to Fra Gherardo,' belong to a world which might be called legendary, even when the time and place of action are fixed, legendary not only because they are im- mersed in a fantastic environment, but because they present types of humanity idealized and reduced to their quintessence. In these charac- ters the passions are goaded and purified at the same time. Theirs is a life which springs from ours but unfolds itself on a higher plane. There is nothing monstrous or inhuman in them, but rather an ardent aspira- tion towards peace and love, towards equilibrium of mind and spirit, towards Christian wisdom which, as Chesterton writes, does not consist in abject passivity but in apparently contradictory sentiments raised to the highest intensity. Because of their lofty ideals, these characters are little colored by their environment. One might say that a definite anthropomorphic tendency leads the musician to direct his mind away from the consideration of nature and to concentrate it on human beings. Even those orchestral sketches that attempt to depict local color, and show some promptings towards doing so, end up by being character sketches, with only a modest indication of landscape-and that far from the foreground-, such as we find in certain fifteenth-century por- traits. Therefore, we frankly confess that the "Venetian" side of Orsiolo has interested us but little. The two or three descriptive tone-pictures-- the intermezzi from the first and last acts and the grand scene, alla Paolo 1 First American performance at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, March 2, x929.</page><page sequence="4">80 The Musical Quarterly Veronese, of the festival at Ca' Grimani-have only made us wish to return at once to the very intimate drama of the protagonists. The like- wise slight part taken in the drama by the chorus, no longer intimately connected with the action of the characters as in preceding dramas, helps to place the protagonists in bold relief, and focusses the interest of the drama on them. The real protagonists are, in the final analysis, Marco Orskolo and his daughter Contarina. The essential contrast is neither that between the old Inquisitor and the youthful Rinieri Fusiner, nor that between the aristocracy and the new bourgeoisie. Although the latter contrast served to fire Pizzetti's imagination, there is no trace of it between the old man and Contarina. Orsiolo has some traits of Deborah, the prophetess (the heroine of an earlier work of Pizzetti's). He is bound by the imperious demands of law and honor, and he does not perceive, in his proud inexorability, that there is something higher, a still mightier power, which rules the world: love. Contarina is the young girl who does not know evil and does not even conceive of it, who is horrified at things repugnant to her sensibility. She is the Pizzettian woman par excellence, very little the modern, a creature who is all sensibility, in- stinct, sweetness, devotion, without any pretensions towards intellectual- ity, who sees and foresees only through the force of her passion. Rinieri Fusiner is the vaguest of the three principal characters. At bottom he is more the symbol of his aspirations than a living character. Sometimes his acts become indefinite and incoherent. He is a mathematical "limit," like Fra Gherardo before him. He often gropes in the twilight of a crisis that has no dawn, because he yearns for something his excessive scruples will always render unattainable. The action which brings face to face these three characters, and others of secondary importance, is sharp and dynamic and does not resolve itself into a catharsis. It produces a situation that cannot be over- come, and it is precisely the awareness of this situation that constitutes the drama. Some have called the action melodramatic, perhaps because it reminds them of characters and scenes from certain nineteenth-century operas; others have hinted at lack of originality in the plot. What is undoubtedly true of the impression of a recourse to Verdi's style, con- demned by some critics, is that there is a great frequency in change of atmosphere as well as a great vivacity of action. In our opinion, these, rather than being faults, constitute a high merit, when the opera is com-</page><page sequence="5">Recent Italian Operas 81 pared with Pizzetti's earlier works, and lead to a greater agility in the declamation than the composer had achieved before. In Orsholo, more perhaps than in Pizzetti's other operas, the music is a function of the drama. It is absurd, therefore, to speak of the music and drama separately, and to praise the musician at the expense of the dramatist. Whenever the drama flags, the musical expression suddenly becomes indifferent and vague. The same may be said of the scenes that lead up to the big moments and of those that provide background. Pizzetti is not the man for colorful episodes. On the contrary, he has the urge to go directly to the heart of things without pausing over inciden- tals. He has no use for lengthy circumlocution. The picturesque, the entertaining, the anecdotal are not for him. But, given a dramatic situa- tion, he can exploit it to the utmost. Confront him with protagonists free from all external conventions, with naked souls, and he will in- variably penetrate deeply into their emotions, and express them with forceful language. Consider, for example, the trenchant encounter be- tween Orstolo and his son Marino, perhaps the finest example of incisive and throbbing melodic discourse in the opera, couched in simple and expressive harmonies. Consider the entire scene, in the second act, be- tween Contarina and Rinieri and between these two and her brothers; consider the finale of the opera, with Orstolo's last words of farewell, uttered by one who has renounced all and who can, therefore, look at men and things with a soul detached from the world. An act so full of deep sympathy for the anguish of men as the last one, with so chiseled and plastic a picture of the human passions, and with so Christian an acquiescence in the Supreme Will, is not to be found elsewhere in con- temporary opera. If such renunciation is not human, there is no faith that can justify it. But with Orsiolo it is illumined by the light of for- giveness ("We all have need of forgiveness," he says just before the end), and we can truly affirm that art has created few characters that are equally worthy of our understanding, admiration, and love. With Giulio Cesare, G. Francesco Malipiero emerges from the boundaries of his magic enclosure, symbolistic and somewhat esoteric, and looks out on the vast world of man's eternal passions. Those who, like us, have followed the activities of this artist for the past twenty</page><page sequence="6">82 The Musical Quarterly years, particularly in connection with his operatic works, do not find in his last opera any sign of a change in course, or of recantation, but rather a deepening and ripening which have already been evident in the preceding operas, from Mistero di Venezia to Favola del Figlio Cam- biato, on the last of which it would be fair to ask for a more dispassionate judgment. There are in Giulio Cesare a maturity of expressive means, a complete mastery of style, and a penetration of human values, all essen- tial to a proper treatment of the dramatic material which, Shakespeare helping, is no longer obscured by a romanticism bordering on the pathological. It is a work that does not hover in an atmosphere of night- mare unreality, but is firmly planted on an earth inhabited by characters who are neither lunar phantoms nor wrangling apparitions but true creatures--creatures whose spiritual stature renders them on first meet- ing worthy of our admiration and sympathy. Greatly to be admired, whatever one's appraisal of this opera, is Malipiero's constancy, his hav- ing kept faith in pursuing his own course, without any deviations or disavowals. He has borne countless grievances with that smiling and somewhat fatalistic tenacity characteristic of the true artist. Malipiero's distaste for formal and psychological developments is well known. A personage is presented and characterized on his first appearance. His emotional life undergoes no gradual development, but is unfolded in a series of moods bound together solely by common refer- ence to the same individual; that is to say, there is no attempt to justify the nature of one mood by that of the preceding or to explain how and why one has passed into the next. Here is no subtle art of transitions, but a rigorous and sometimes almost brutal painting of sudden flash- light exposures, showing "sections" of the soul on different levels. Thus, a theme or fragment of a theme is to be considered by itself; it expresses what it wants to express. It does not wind and unwind itself like thread on a spool. The musical idiom does not proceed in circular fashion, but directly; it progresses by additions or repetitions, not by elaborations. Beautiful or ugly, the Malipiero theme has an accent, a style, that renders it unmistakeable. The composer's absolute indifference to the possibility of thematic development causes him to choose each theme for what it can express at the moment, without any preoccupation concerning what it may become later. Following such a principle of "composition," Malipiero has selected those moments in Shakespeare's tragedy which seemed to him essential</page><page sequence="7">Recent Italian Operas 83 for the musical representation of the drama of Julius Caesar and the conspirators. These essential moments are three: the planning of the conspiracy; the slaying and the subsequent alarm of Brutus, Cassius, and the populace; and the victory of Caesar's partisans and successors, that is, the triumph of his ideas. This selection is debatable, like all selec- tions, but it could hardly have been otherwise. (Debatable also is the Italian translation of Shakespeare's English, and unjustifiable are certain expressions neither Shakespearean nor Roman.) It is evident that Mali- piero could not deal with the episodes of the two women at great length, or abandon himself to the pathos of the two scenes of farewell. Never- theless, these have proved to be among the best passages in the opera. (Certainly those who are acquainted with Shakespeare's tragedy and know the tenderness and heartrending melancholy of the words in which, before the battle, Brutus recalls his dead Portia, will regret the omission of this episode by the musician-librettist.) It is equally evident that it was not possible for him to suppress entirely certain rhetorical speeches which render the last act heavy and sluggish, because these provide the conclusion at which Shakespeare (and Malipiero as a con- sequence) had "logically" to arrive, after the words and occurrences of the preceding acts. As has repeatedly been stated, Malipiero's characters do not sing, but declaim. (The composer himself often expressly indicates that he wishes declamation, so that the words may be understood clearly.) But this is not to say that they always declaim in the same manner, or that their intoned speech does not take fire, in moments of pathos, to the point of indicating the outlines of a melody. Naturally, we are on a plane other than that of ordinary opera; but the difference between prose narration and burning lyricism is readily revealed in passages between one char- acter and another, in different passages assigned to the same character, and between one moment of the action and another. Mark Antony, when overwhelmed by Caesar's murder, speaks to the lifeless body in a musical idiom different from that used when he addresses the populace and skilfully leads it to rebellion against the conspirators. Portia's sad appeals to Brutus have quite a different ring from those of Calpurnia to Caesar; the similarity of the two situations--one might call them symmetrical-has not misled the musician, who distinguishes them clearly. We have indicated the dramatic weakness of the third act; but the</page><page sequence="8">84 The Musical Quarterly structure of the first two acts is truly admirable. When one thinks of the stature of the characters, of the halo of history and legend that sur- rounds them, and of the import of their words, one realizes that no other form of musical speech would have suited them. Malipiero's idiom, terse and vigorous, is well adapted to the characters of this work as well as to the background of their period. This precise and metrical language serves to place in high relief their will to action, the austerity of their thoughts, and the nobility of their feelings. The orchestra creates a web of sound by which the vocal parts are neither obscured nor separated from the whole. There are no thematic repetitions, save for some rare exceptions; and there is no overladen counterpoint, but, instead, a con- tinuous flow of melodic lines which center on the core of the dramatic moment and heighten its effect to the utmost. Malipiero's use of cer- tain instruments is truly original and extremely effective, as, to take one example among many, in the duet between Brutus and Cassius in the first scene of the opera, which has a running choral commentary, punc- tuated, here and there, solely by instruments of percussion. This con- stitutes one of the most beautiful pages of the score, and perhaps in all contemporary opera. Giulio Cesare was a success at its first performance at Genoa (Teatro Carlo Felice, February 8, 1936). And success has not been confined to the applause of a sophisticated first-night audience. The favorable recep- tion has been repeated in subsequent performances before ordinary audiences ignorant both of Malipiero's "platform" and of his esthetics, audiences which, above all, did not go to hear the opera knowing beforehand what to think of it. The performance of Cyrano de Bergerac by Franco Alfano at the Teatro Reale, Rome (January 23, I936), once more brings into con- sideration the stylistic problem of this composer, concerning which we have already written at length in the October 1934 issue of The Musical Quarterly. Alfano began his operatic career in 1904, at the age of twenty- eight, with a successful performance of the opera Risurrezione, based on Tolstoy's tale.2 After a lapse of twenty years, it has recently been revived on the Italian stage with fair acclaim on the part of its new public. 2 First American performance (in French) by the Chicago Opera Company, January I, I926.</page><page sequence="9">Recent Italian Operas 85 Riasurrezione, let us state frankly, is neither an original nor a significant opera, but it undoubtedly has certain qualities of directness and fresh- ness that are engaging. It is built on the plan of Italian melodrama of the late nineteenth century, its nearest model being that followed in Giordano's "Russian" operas, Fedora and Siberia. But it has certain fine points in writing, certain shades of meaning, certain emphases (besides a display of an already sure mastery of technical means), that distin- guish it from the operas of the numerous progeny of that school which, for want of a better name, is called "realistic." The choice of libretto is enough to show that Alfano aimed to detach himself from the "realistic" and to find poetic accents in a less prosaic world than that of his col- leagues. With L'Ombra di Don Giovanni, which had no success (be- cause of weakness in the libretto), his aspirations towards greater pene- tration in character delineation become more pronounced and are partly realized. Even more marked is Alfano's almost spasmodic propensity for underlining musically the slightest gesture of his characters. This tendency, when overindulged, leads to harmonic and instrumental pre- ciosity. Both the good qualities and the defects here mentioned, stand out clearly in the Leggenda di Sakuntala, an opera thoroughly imbued with poetry and lyricism. Fundamentally, however, it lacks genuine dramatic contrast because its characters are symbolic abstractions of primordial sentiments. But wherever the melody attains concreteness of artistic expression the opera is an indisputable example of personality and inspiration. Cyrano de Bergerac comes after the unhappy experiments in musical comedy made in Madonna Imperia (I927)3 and L'ultimo Lord (1930), and is meant to constitute, according to the author's own declaration, a return to that greater simplicity and economy of elaboration already applied by him shortly before in his chamber-music. When the choice of Cyrano as a subject became known, the current belief was that it might prove well adapted for a temperament as exuberant and "Vesu- vian" as Alfano's. It seemed that no character could reflect the im- petuosity of the composer better than Cyrano. But Alfano seems to have had some misgivings concerning the use of rhetorical language. In order to portray a character as imbued with rhetoric (not in a deroga- tory sense) as the hero of Rostand's play, he should have given the music a corresponding measure of grandiloquence and emphasis, a certain high- 8 First American performance at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, February 8, I928.</page><page sequence="10">86 The Musical Quarterly spiritedness, strutting and gesticulating, with which to express Cyrano's various lyrical flights. Instead, Alfano has sacrificed too much to his good taste and to the elegance of his idiom. He has consequently not given us a living Cyrano, except in the last act when the hero's loquacity and bombast have left him and he is simply a man about to die, a sad human being divested of all trappings. In the symmetrical forms of the songs and ballades, the music should have attained the necessary sprightliness, boastfulness, and directness, through simple and transparent harmonies. But the composer has feared to seem too melodramatic and has relapsed into his overdecorated and labored style, as well as into difficult and tortuous vocal writing. Here again, the composer has provided an orchestral commentary made up of short, rapidly moving figures rather than of long, full melodic lines and simple colors (as, to take two ex- amples, in the presentation of the Gascon cadets and in the scene of Christian's challenge in Ragueneau's rotisserie). Nevertheless, the opera has moments of definite effectiveness and exquisite poetry. The entire last act has a coherence of style and an emotional power that are highly to be praised. There are other noteworthy passages also, such as the close of the first act, depicting Paris blanketed with snow, and the battle-scene, which reveals a robust Alfano, seldom encountered elsewhere. The re- ception of Cyrano de Bergerac (composed directly to the French text of Rostand, adapted by Henri Cain, the noted librettist of Massenet) has been very cordial; the opera will soon be admitted to the repertory of the Opdra-Comique at Paris. The operas which we have here discussed have been produced dur- ing the period between May 1935 and March I936. But, if we go back a little and consider the operatic production of the three years previous, other works present themselves to our recollection. It is impossible to overlook the late Ottorino Respighi's La Fiamma. The success this work achieved at its first performance at Rome, January 23, I934, has already been confirmed in the opera-houses of other centers, Italian and foreign.' Here is an opera by a master who on every page reveals the perfection of a fine craftsman and exceptional facility in depicting both psychological states and local color. The action, which in G. Wiers Jenssen's original takes place in Scandinavia, has been transplanted by the Italian librettist 4 First American production by the Chicago City Opera Company, December 2, 1935.</page><page sequence="11">Recent Italian Operas 87 to Ravenna in the last years of the seventh century. It is not improbable that Respighi's conception of the opera received its first impulse from the suggestions offered by the color and mysticism of the Byzantine mosaics at San Vitale and San Apollinare. Nor should we fail to note the work of another stage composer who has received recognition outside of Italy, Riccardo Zandonai. In La Farsa amorosa, this composer has contributed a brilliant comedy, distinctly Italian in its types and its sketching of the countryside. He, also, has shifted the scene of action: with the collaboration of the librettist Rossato, he has transferred the background of P. de Alarcon's Sombrero de tres Picos to Brianza (Lombardy) during the Spanish domination of the seventeenth century. Zandonai has set out to give a simple, wholesome, and savory picture of Lombard life, which will be quite familiar to those who have read Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi. There are lively scenes, permeated with the dance and song of the people, and, by way of contrast, the arrogant posturing of Don Ferrante, the Spanish cavalier (an unmistakable reminiscence of Manzoni). Don Ferrante is the podestz of the village, an elderly Don Giovanni naturally mocked and ridiculed by the people. Zandonai's language in this comedy is not wanting in vivacity, fluency, and character, though in several places the scenes are so cast that there is clearly evident a derivation from parallel situations and characters in Verdi's immortal Falstaf, and even in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi and the masques of his Turandot. In the same popular vein, but with more of the peasant and outdoor flavor, is Giuseppe Mulk's opera, Liolk, based on one of Luigi Pirandello's plays. Mulk is a Sicilian musician who knows and lives the musical folk-lore of his native island. He has, moreover, what may be called a Hellenic sense of proportion and classical reserve, which render his lan- guage extraordinarily stylistic and vigorous, and much akin to that of the Sicilian peasants who people the stage of his new opera. An uncommon success has been awarded Ludovico Rocca's opera, The Dybbuk.5 In fact, with regard to popular success, it stands out prominently from the bulk of Italian post-war production. By this state- ment we do not mean to infer that the opera caters to the taste of the coarser public, but merely to point out the decidedly theatrical character of the work. Rocca, who already has to his credit notable compositions in the field of concert music, has shown that he possesses a sure sense S First American performance at Detroit, May 6, I936.</page><page sequence="12">88 The Musical Quarterly of the theater and of theatrical perspective, both by the selection of his libretto and the manner in which he has invested it with a musical set- ting. His music is neither excessively elaborate nor strongly individual, but it is perfectly adapted to underscoring the forceful situations of the libretto, which has been derived by Renato Simoni from Ansky's well- known Yiddish drama. Above all, it is able to accentuate, by means of appropriate orchestral and choral commentary, the atmosphere of mysticism and magic. Hence, the ensemble scenes are to be valued more highly than those in which the drama contrasts the passions of individual figures, who do not always employ a musical language that is charac- teristic and convincing. Nevertheless, Rocca's effort is deserving of high praise, and leads one to expect a great deal from the next stage-work of this forty-one year old musician. However brief this review of recent Italian operas, it may be well to mention a few others. Mascagni's Nerone and Don Licinio Refice's Cecilia have been heartily acclaimed in several opera-houses. The youth- ful Gianandrea Gavazzeni's Paolo e Virginia and Annibale Bizzelli's II Dottor Oss have served to bring to the attention of the public two newcomers to the lyric stage. Antonio Veretti (with his Una Favola di Anderson, in one act), Vittorio Rieti (the composer of Teresa nel bosco), and Guido Guerrini (who has written La Vigna), on the other hand, have yet to win their spurs in this field. The efforts of all these com- posers may well be counted upon to contribute towards the development of the Italian music of tomorrow. (Translated by Vincent Aita)</page></plain_text>
