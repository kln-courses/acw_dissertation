<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTHEW ARNOLD'S CONCEPT OF NATURE: A SYNTHESIST'S VIEW Sylvia Bailey Shurbutt "Fret not yourself to make my poems square in all their parts," wrote Matthew Arnold to his sister Jane in 1853. "The true reason why parts suit you while others do not is that my poems are fragments . . . that I am fragments."1 Arnold was well aware that his poems, taken individually, lacked philosophic wholeness. Yet he was also aware that in the long view they would, like a pointillist painting, evince a sense of completeness and roundness indiscernible from a shallow perspective.2 Looked at from a proximity too near, the pointillist's work is a mere confusion of primary, often conflicting colors, a formless magnification of disconcerting hues. Many critics of Arnold's concept of nature have committed the error of standing too close to Arnold's portrait; they have paid too close attention to the parts and missed the whole. Consequently, such descriptive malfeasances as "ambivalent," "inconsistent," "confused," "incompatible," and "incomprehensible" have been too often directed at Arnold's concept of nature, a concept which has been called both a Victorian compromise and a Victorian "copout." Arnold once lamented the many "pitfalls" in the word "nature." Yet we have stumbled into our own pitfalls as we have attempted to discern just what precisely that charged word meant to one of the most complex poets of the Victorian period. Joseph Warren Beach in The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry has been one of the most vocal decriers of Arnold's attitude toward nature. Beach has stated that Arnold's references to nature in the abstract show a certain confusion of attitude, at times deprecating nature as "the world of things" opposed to the moral world of man, and at other times exalting the "moral qualities" of nature "above the restlessness of man."3 ^Unpublished Letters of Matthew Arnold, ed. A. Whitridge (Yale Univ. Press, 1923), p. 18. 2"My poems represent, on the whole, he wrote to his mother on June 5, 1869, the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century, and thus they will probably have their day as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is, and interested in the literary productions which reflect it" (Letters of Matthew Arnold, ed. G. W. E. Russell, Vol. XIV of The Works of Matthew Arnold [1903-04; rpt. New York, 1970], p. 195). 3(New York, 1956), pp. 397-400. 97</page><page sequence="2">98 / VICTORIAN POETRY For Beach, Arnold exhibits too dim a sense of the "complex and massive implications of the term nature" (p. 402). T. S. Eliot and Erik Frykman find equal confusion in Arnold's thought, especially with what Frykman calls the "inconsistency in Arnold's use of the concept of nature."4 Derek Colville feels that Arnold's "entire view of natural scenery almost always has this ambivalence": in one poem nature is red in tooth and claw, an immoral entity to be surpassed by man; in another it is "a silent, eloquent rebuke to the realities of the human dilemma"; and in still others, a "consolation" or "invitation to escape." And John M. Robertson instills in his readers a sense of Arnold's pathetic inconsistency with such phrases as "intellectual defects," "want of logic and thoroughness of thought," "capricious sensibilities," and "fallacy" in logic.5 However, Arnold's thought with regard to nature was far from capricious. It evolved from careful study of Wordsworth's nature myth (which, of course, Arnold in large part rejected), from his reading of Senancour, Goethe, Spinoza, and from forays into such works of Eastern religious philosophy as the Bhagavad Gita. Arnold's attitude toward nature is certainly complex, but it is neither inconsistent, ambivalent, nor capricious.6 Part of the problem the modern critic has with Arnold's concept of nature is due to his characteristic habit of using expanded definitions. Evidence of this linguistic laziness can be seen in Arnold's broad definitions of "literature," "culture," and "morality."7 Geoffrey Tillotson has soundly chastised Arnold for his vague and abstract use of such terms as "Zeitgeist," "influences," and "tendencies." These words become so nearly abstractions that they lose the quality of any precise meaning at all.8 Thus, our difficulty in dealing with what has been called Arnold's "many natures" comes in part from the broad definition which he characteristically gives the term. 4T.

Robert Stange finds no fundamental contradiction in Arnold's so-called "many natures," preferring to view these as corresponding to the various forms of self-consciousness in man (Matthew Arnold: The Poet As Humanist [Princeton Univ. Press, 1967], p. 105). Dwight Culler too seems unbothered by any supposed inconsistency in Arnold's view of nature. Culler suggests that Arnold's several ideas of nature correspond to the three phases in his poetic world: the Forest Glade, the Burning or Darkling Plain, and the Wide-Glimmering Sea. For example, if he writes of an "independent preacher" (still intellectually in the Forest Glade), then nature is "cruel and fickle"; elsewhere, however, the concept of nature might be a "loftier one," one of cosmic movement, because man's vantage point is from another place in Arnold's poetic world (Imaginative Reason: The Poetry of Matthew Arnold [Yale Univ. Press, 1966], p. 35). 7Matthew Arnold, Philistinism in England and America, Vol. X of The Complete Prose Works of Matthew Arnold, ed. R. H.

Even Arnold admitted the similarity between his generation and Pope's: "The people were just like ourselves," he once told his wife when speaking of Pope's contemporaries.9 Both ages have a strong objective sense of landscape. The word "nature" has for Arnold much the same connotation as for many eighteenth-century writers, meaning alike human nature and external nature - both bound by the same vast laws, yet laws appropriate for each individual mode of nature according to its own unique level of being. Thus, human nature has something more than external nature: a moral consciousness which is appropriate to the human level of being. Carlyle, like Arnold, felt the immense complexity and enigmatic quality of the term "nature." "Nature," he said, is "like the Sphinx"; she has the "face and bosom of a goddess, but ending in claws and the body of a lioness. There is in her celestial beauty, - which means celestial order, pliancy to wisdom; but there is also a darkness, a ferocity. . . . Answer her riddle, it is well with thee."10 Following Carlyle's imperative, Arnold went a long way toward answering the riddle. Arnold believed that though nature may appear to wear many faces, there is, in fact, only one reality, one nature. No simple, superficial, or rosy Romantic view would do as he attempted to discern what that reality was. Arnold would, as Goethe and Spinoza had done, see nature for what it was - a multifaceted complexity but essentially one essence, one all- encompassing, ordered universe which includes both the calm world of the sfar and the ruthless world of the claw. Man can, on the one hand, strive to be like nature (the star) and on the other hand strive to surpass nature (the claw), but this does not imply that Arnold's view of nature is inconsistent; it is just broader than the Romantic view, the early Words worthian view which Basil Willey calls one which thinks of "Nature as a benign goddess or glorified schoolmistress, ever correcting our errors, moulding our growth, and leading us back to the sources of our spiritual health."1 1 Arnold believed that one could be spiritually renewed by nature without being nature's fast friend, without feeling a kinship with nature. Students of literature have been so conditioned by Wordsworth's view of nature that we tend to use him as our point of reference. Wordsworth saw a benevolent spirit and a solace in nature; thus we come to associate the two and cannot accept the solace as possible even though there be no benevolent spirit. What, more precisely, is Arnold's view of nature? One gleans parts of the basic concept from the whole canon of his poetry, not from single poems, which, as he admitted, are but fragments. Again, while Arnold concedes that ^Letters, Vol. XV of The Works of Matthew Arnold, p. 88. l0Past and Present, Vol. X of The Works of Thomas Carlyle (New York, 1969V d. 7. "The English Moralists (New York, 1964), p. 78.</page><page sequence="4">100 / VICTORIAN POETRY nature has many faces - cosmic, metaphysical, amoral, ruthless, sublime, indifferent, and sympathetic - there is but one nature. We might refer to the cosmic or metaphysical face, the changeless face, as a "higher" self; likewise, we might call the ruthless, changing face, or even the sympathetic face, the "lower" self. One is intransient; the other, transient. But the same force that "through the green fuse drives the flower" permeates the mangled prey or the changeless star- only that force is both within and outside the temporal, both immanent and transcendent. Each unique aspect of the universe is true to itself, lives or ceases to live according to the law of its being, that great "general life," as Arnold calls it. Nature's many faces are themselves but illusions dependent upon the state of man's own consciousness. Arnold thought, as did Goethe, that there only seemed to be many natures because of man's limited vantage point. Goethe, whose scientific attitude toward nature Arnold much admired, once told Eckermann: We see the world one way from a plain, another way from the promontory, another from the glacier fields of the Alps. We see, from one of these points, a larger piece of the world than from the other; but who can say that we see most truly from one of them?12 The limitation of young Wordsworth's conception of nature, as Arnold saw it, was that he saw only a single benign and gentle face, one easily and erroneously identifiable with man.13 Arnold draws upon all the faces of nature in his poetry. At times nature provides simply a backdrop for a Scholar Gipsy or a Thyrsis - a Romantic landscape, yet without the transcendental sentience or corresponding sympathies of the Words worthian setting. Interestingly, this idealized landscape is almost always viewed in retrospect, with the poet's looking back in time at a golden age or associating the setting with some Romantic figure like Senancour, Wordsworth, or a Scholar Gipsy. Such an idealization of nature never occurs when Arnold speaks of his own age: Screened is this nook o'er the high, half-reaped field, And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be. Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep, And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep; And air-swept lindens yield Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid, And bower me from the August sun with shade.14 12Johann Peter Eckermann, Conversations with Goethe, Vol. IV of Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature, trans.

Here is the realist's perception. Time is present, and the physical world is unadorned by man's fancy: "Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood; / Nature is stubborn, man would fain adore" ("In Harmony with Nature," 11. 7-8). And at still other times, Arnold provides us with a calm, serene nature beyond the transient strife of human woe, a higher nature which unknowingly or uncaringly provides a pattern of conduct for man by its very disinterested, self-contained, and self-possessed state of being; quite often stars, moon, mountains, or sea will represent this "higher" nature: ye stars, ye waters, Unaffrighted by the silence round them, Undistracted by the sights they see, These demand not that the things without them Yield them love, amusement, sympathy. For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting All the fever of some differing soul. ("Self-Dependence," 11. 9, 17-20, 23-24) A number of poems have caused scholars special difficulty and have led them to think Arnold's attitude toward nature inconsistent. "Quiet Work" has often been viewed as a Wordsworthian statement in which a sentient nature corresponds to the mind of man and teaches him essential values. This interpretation seems to put the poem at odds with Arnold's "In Harmony with Nature," where nature has none of these Wordsworthian characteristics. However, a close look at "Quiet Work" will show that it is quite compatible with "In Harmony." Addressing nature, the poet asks that one lesson be learned from her: "Of toil unsevered from tranquillity! / Of labour . . . accomplished in repose" (11. 5-7). Amid the chaos and discord of man's busy world, one would do well to follow the lofty example of an infinite nature: Yes, while on earth a thousand discords ring, Still do thy sleepless ministers move on, Their glorious tasks in silence perfecting. (11. 9, 11-12) Though the poem may seem a Romantic statement, there are marked differences between the Wordsworthian view and the Arnoldian. Wordsworth's "wise passiveness" becomes Arnold's lofty calm, a tranquillity which proceeds from a stoic acceptance of a universal order beyond man's petty, "fitful" toil. Rather than sharing a sympathetic correspondence, man and nature are separated. The sestet of the sonnet underscores this separateness: after the poet addresses nature in her own realm, he then speaks of the realm of man as if it were a different world: "while on earth a thousand discords ring."</page><page sequence="6">102 / VICTORIAN POETRY A poem similar in tone to "Quiet Work" is "Lines Written in Kensington Gardens"; this poem too has been used in the past as an example of Arnold's Wordsworthian Romanticism and thus a contradiction to other Arnold poems of the same period. Again, however, a closer reading will show the poem is not in conflict with Arnold's other works. Here we have a natural setting of quiet calm, a protected glade screened from the hubbub of city life by deep, shading boughs. Within this setting the speaker lies, Werther-like, in the grass and feels the calm presence of the world of things. Man's meaningless activity and impatience seem a contrast - indeed the speaker almost an intruder himself - to the scene: In this lone, open glade I lie, Screened by deep boughs on either hand; And at its end, to stay the eye, Those black-crowned, red-boled pine-trees stand! (11. 1-4) The "red-boled pine-trees" appear as sentinels, keeping out the intruding "upper world." The birds make gentle song, which contrasts to the "girdling city's hum" (1. 6). When Arnold speaks of the city sounds or the activities of man, his language is harsher than usual; the several voiceless glottal fricatives magnify the harshness, as do the final accented syllables which give some of the lines almost a "sprung rhythm" effect: In the huge world, which roars hard by, I, on men's impious uproar hurled, Think often, as I hear them rave, That peace has left the upper world. (11. 21, 25-27) The calm inspired by the Kensington setting which so contrasts with the world of man prompts the speaker to ask for that peace to fill him: Calm soul of all things ! make it mine To feel, amid the city's jar, That there abides a peace of thine Man did not make, and cannot mar. (11. 37-40) But that peace in nature is one which the speaker can only hope to be a part of; in reality he is too much with the "huge world, which roars hard by" to be compatible with the bucolic scene before him. Man's separation from nature is the essence of the poem. Andrew Griffin has given one of the most intriguing interpretations of "Kensington Gardens." Griffin sees Arnold's secluded bower as itself emblematic of the Victorian attitude toward nature, an attitude vastly different from the Romantic. Nature for the Romantic mind, for Wordsworth, offered "a return of feeling, and a return to self: a reviving sense of self, with the mingled peace and joy, soaring spirits and healthful ease,</page><page sequence="7">SYLVIA BAILEY SHURBUTT / 103 that a secure selfhood seems to confer."15 For the Victorian, who could not with open arms embrace a natural world he knew to be hostile or at best indifferent, an interior garden is created - a shaded glade, a protected bower, some secluded spot within the confines of a cultivated world or in the shadow of some protective monastery. This is both an inversion of Wordsworth and an "internalization of the Romantic process." It is an inversion in that man does not escape to a nature free from civilized bonds but to a world itself enclosed; it is an internalization of the Romantic process in that man no longer looks into nature to find himself but into self to find nature: "His [Arnold's] meditation begins with a man in a landscape but ends with a landscape in a man," and there Arnold discovers a whole new geography, a mythical landscape - succinctly discussed by Dwight Culler - which follows the course of a river (the genuine self) from mountains to wide glimmering sea. "A man may look into himself to discover this pastoral landscape, which embodies Arnold's yearnings for an unbaffled selfhood and feelings that freely flow" (Griffin, pp. 174-175). The poem most often set in opposition to "Quiet Work" and "Kensington Gardens" is "In Harmony with Nature." For example, Lionel Trilling sees "In Harmony" as a direct contradiction of "Quiet Work."16 And if one looks at "Quiet Work" and "Kensington Gardens" as Wordsworthian statements, which close reading shows they are not, then they do in fact contradict "In Harmony." However, when a careful reading of the first two poems in juxtaposed with a close consideration of "In Harmony," then the three poems seem not so philosophically far apart. The opening lines of "In Harmony" find the poet chastising the foolish preacher for his naivete in believing there exists a moral correspondence between man and nature. One senses that Arnold is in reality chastising the Romantic imagination which embellishes nature with human sentiment and sentience: "In harmony with Nature?" Restless fool, Who with such heat dost preach what were to thee, When true, the last impossibility - To be like Nature strong, like Nature cool! (11. 1-4) There is no harmony between man and nature. Nature is amoral, fickle, cruel. Man is separated from nature by his moral consciousness. Any correspondence between the mind of man and the essence of "things" is merely a figment of man's imagination and a manifestation of his supreme 15"The Interior Garden and John Stuart Mill," in Nature and the Victorian Imagination, eds. U. C. Knoepflmacher and G. B. Tennyson (Univ. of California Press, 1977), p. 172. ^Matthew Arnold (Columbia Univ. Press, 1949), p. 89.</page><page sequence="8">104 / VICTORIAN POETRY egotism and anthropomorphism. Outward nature is merely mechanistic, disconcerting, unfeeling phenomena: Know, man hath all which Nature hath, but more, And in that more lie all his hopes of good. Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood; Nature is stubborn, man would fain adore; Nature is fickle, man hath need of rest; Nature forgives no debt, and fears no grave; Man would be mild, and with safe conscience blest. (11. 5-11) If anything, man must surpass nature; he must begin "where Nature ends" (1. 12), or he must create his own internal landscape to reach the ideal of selfhood. One must ever be aware when comparing "In Harmony" with Arnold's other poems that nowhere does Arnold state that man and nature are, in fact, in harmony. The realities of the natural world indicate just the opposite. Arnold believes certainly there are benefits to be gained from nature, but nature is no moral source or moral inspiration for man; the moral source is man himself. What the poems consistently point toward then is Arnold's profound humanism. Though a fundamental question with which man must come to grips is the essence of nature, it is with man himself that the poetry is ultimately concerned - man's attempt to function and survive in a social world, man's relationship with man, the only relationship not predetermined, mechanistic, or governed by immoveable laws. Matthew Arnold's concept of the natural world, however, functions as a "touchstone" for most of the basic ideas found in his poetry and prose; Arnold's stoicism and ideal of calm, his ideas of self-dependence and the buried self, his concept of the "general life" and acquiescence, his creative approach of objectivity and disinterestedness - all in some way are derived from or are influenced by his concept of nature. It is a concept which pervades his work, acting as a catalyst, stimulating and molding ideas. It is a concept which, while complex, is certainly not contradictory. Nature has many faces: cold and warm, hostile and appealing, indifferent and awesomely inspiring. Arnold's virtue is that he attempted, as best he could, to portray nature's many faces, that he tried to see her through unclouded eyes and if possible to shatter the Romantic myth that would present only a refracted gleam in the prismatic mystery of the natural world.</page></plain_text>
