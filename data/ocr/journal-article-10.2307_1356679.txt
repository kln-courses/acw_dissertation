<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egypt Before the Pharaohs: The Prehistoric Foundations of Egyptian Civilization, by Michael A. Hoffman. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979. Pp. xxi + 392, 84 illustrations. $15.95. Michael Hoffman has written a long and detailed book that is bound to influence the study of the development of ancient Egyptian civilization. One may hope that it will encourage broader interest among archaeologists in this curiously neglected topic. The preface states that the publisher's editor was deeply involved in the organization of the book. This may explain the effort to pursue both scholarly and popularizing objectives. As a result, perhaps neither objective is achieved as well as if it had been pursued alone. We are told that the book was written "for the pleasure and edification of the general reader." It follows the format success- fully pioneered in an earlier popular publication by Knopf: Geoffrey Bibby's The Testimony of the Spade (1956). Like Bibby, Hoffman recounts the history of archaeological research in a region in a vivid, anecdotal fashion that deals with the careers of specific archaeologists. At the same time he shows how our present knowledge of the prehistory of the region has resulted from this research. Hoffman enlivens his narrative with appropriate excerpts from old monographs and dramatizes his interpretations of Egyptian prehistory by drawing imaginative parallels with the history of the eastern United States. The book is divided into an introduction and five additional parts, each consisting of a number of chapters. The first part discusses the Palaeolithic archaeology of Egypt in connection with the pioneering work of K. S. Sandford and W. J. Arkell but more especially, in view of its recent development, with the work of Fred Wendorf and his associates. The part on the Predynastic period in Upper Egypt introduces the "irascible" W. M. F. Petrie, James Quibell, F. W. Green, Guy Brunton, and Gertrude Caton Thompson; the Predynastic in Lower Egypt uses the work of Hermann Junker, Fernand Debono, Oswald Menghin, and Mustafa Amer; the "People of the Fron- tiers" uses George Reisner's excavations in Nubia; and the Early Dynastic uses the research of Petrie, Walter Emery, and Zaki Saad. Hoffman's vignettes paint a vivid picture of the rivalries, animosities, adventures, and accomplishments of these archaeologists. Deserved praise is lavished on the work of Junker and Caton Thompson, as well as on the roles played by Petrie and Reisner in successively raising the standards of archaeological research in Egypt. Regrettably, Hoffman does not refer to D. G. Kendall's studies of the brilliant and original mathematical approaches that Petrie employed in his studies of ancient Egyptian culture. The suggestion that Petrie failed to publish a complete report on his work at Naqada because he feared it would reveal weaknesses in his much-acclaimed origi- nal report is unsubstantiated. There is also much criticism of the shortcomings of earlier work that in historical perspective seems unjustified. As a popular account of Egyptian prehistory, the book falls short of perfection. Archaeological methods are often described in an elementary fashion and sometimes inaccurately. For example, Petrie did not seriate Predynastic pottery by noting the relative position of each object "on a stylistic scale running from simple to complex" (p. 118). Nor does the plus/minus figure associated with carbon 14 dates indicate how far the "true date" may vary from the one given (p. 64). On the other hand, the long interpretative sections, especially in the latter part of the book, read like articles intended for professional journals. Despite their author's plea for a more literate archaeology, they are replete with jargon such as "powerfact," "localized storage- redistributive system," and "conquest-oriented elite." These terms obfuscate rather than elucidate his ideas. More careful editing would have eliminated certain inconsistencies and ambi- guities, such as occur in the discussion of the social character of the group buried in Cemetery T at Naqada (cf. pp. 118 and 124). The text is marred by some feeble humor, unnecessary repetition, and passages of florid prose. There is also an anti- British bias throughout the book that is redolent of some American writing of earlier times but which will now strike many readers as unjustified and in bad taste. The book also seeks to provide "speculations and generaliza- tions based on currently available evidence" that seem intended for professional archaeologists. It is repeatedly emphasized that it presents a comprehensive account of Egyptian prehistory that overcomes the barriers that have long separated Palaeolithic and Predynastic specialists. Yet Hoffman himself maintains that "the Epipalaeolithic-Predynastic gap remains one of the least known and most important research problems facing prehistorians and archaeologists working in northeastern Africa" (p. 102).</page><page sequence="2">78 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 248 Butzer claims that this results from the scarcity of geological deposits in the Nile Valley north of Aswan that can be dated to between 8000 and 5000 B.c. Hoffman's claim that the cultural mosaic of Upper Palaeolithic times foreshadows the political divisions in Upper Egypt in Predynastic times is unconvincing, since there is no evidence that the latter were accompanied by significant cultural differences. Hoffman indicates the possibil- ity that new peoples entered the Nile Valley at this time and that there may be little ethnic continuity between the Palaeo- lithic and Predynastic periods. Surprisingly, he does not refer to a growing literature concerning the origin and spread of the Afroasiatic language family, to which ancient Egyptian belonged. Yet this material is important for understanding not only the ethnic origins of the ancient Egyptians but also population movements throughout northern Africa during this transitional period. The book provides an up-to-date picture of the prehistoric cultural chronology of the Nile Valley, including the surpris- ingly early Middle Palaeolithic date for the beginning of the Khormusan industry. While noting that thermoluminescence dates from Hemamieh suggest that the Badarian culture may have begun in the sixth millennium B.c., Hoffman accepts the traditional assignment of the Amratian and Gerzean cultures to the fourth millennium. Yet, curiously, bristlecone pine calibra- tions push the beginning of the Early Dynastic period back to about 3400 B.c., many Gerzean dates into the early fourth millennium, and Amratian ones into the fifth millennium. While nothing is certain, some corroboration by thermolumi- nescence dates suggests that the Predynastic cultures may have begun earlier and changed more slowly than is generally believed. T. R. Hays should be added to the list of those who doubt the more fundamental validity of the currently accepted sequence of Predynastic development. Hoffman summarizes much of the recent archaeological liter- ature dealing with cultural development in what are now desert regions bordering on the Nile Valley. He accepts that food- producing may have been practiced in these regions up to a millennium prior to its final acceptance in the Nile Valley. His exposition does not differentiate clearly between developments that were centered south of the Sahara and associated with the Khartoum Mesolithic tradition, and the neolithic influences that originated farther north or reached the Sahara from southwest- ern Asia or the Maghreb. While Hoffman noted that cultures formally classified as Palaeolithic may have engaged in various types of food-production, the book was published too soon to include recent evidence from Wadi Kubbaniya, which suggests that there may have been incipient barley production in the Nile Valley as early as 16,000 B.C. One of his most original and stimulating suggestions is that control over foreign trade, which contributed to the consolidation of Pharaonic power, required the establishment of well-defined political and cultural borders that for the first time distinguished Egypt from what were to become its primitive neighbors. The Predynastic inhabitants of Upper Egypt, whose leaders founded the Pharaonic state, are described as being preoccu- pied with politics, social status, and conspicuous consumption, while the people of Lower Egypt were oriented towards mer- cantilism and foreign relations. This is a restrained and in many respects a persuasive compromise betwen the views of Wolf- gang Helck and many earlier Egyptologists, who saw the pre- historic Delta as the locale of a highly-developed civilization trading with southwestern Asia, and Elise Baumgartel's view of the region as an uninhabited wasteland. Yet the evidence for major involvement in foreign trade so far comes only from one site, Macadi. It remains to be determined how typical this site was of Lower Egypt. Hoffman models his explanation of the rise and expansion of Upper Egyptian civilization on the systems approach that was applied to the Aegean region in Colin Renfrew's book The Emergence of Civilisation (1972). The main factors that he examines are population, environment, technology, subsistence, social stratification, burial and religion, exchange, and conflict. He suggests that a concentration of population around ceremo- nial centers in the Nile Valley, which resulted from decreasing rainfall over the adjacent deserts, facilitated the development of monarchical power. As the acquisition of status became a "national pastime," luxury goods and burial practices grew increasingly elaborate as a means of denoting status. Unfortu- nately, it is currently almost impossible to measure the relative importance of any of the variables that Hoffman considers. He himself sees warfare as sometimes promoting increased nucle- ation of settlement. It remains to be determined whether alterations in climate or warfare were more important in bring- ing about changes in population and population distribution in late Gerzean and Protodynastic times. It is unclear why, in drawing ethnographic parallels, Hoffman compares late Gerzean and Early Dynastic Egypt with the tribal Berawan society rather than with the Thai or Balinese states, which he admits are more appropriate. Like many other archaeologists, Hoffman is tempted to ascribe preeminent importance to his own archaeological site. There is no doubt that Hierakonpolis was important in Predynastic times. Yet the rulers of the First Dynasty were buried at Abydos, where the tombs of what seem to have been their royal ancestors are also located. This suggests that, while Hierakonpolis and Naqada may have been important centers in prehistoric times, the founder of the First Dynasty came, as Manetho claimed, from the Abydos region. In welding together an Upper Egyptian power base, Hierakonpolis and Naqada may have been accorded special ritual importance. It is unclear whether or not Hoffman sees his suggestion that in prehistoric times Naqada may have subdued an area extending into the Delta as supported by Kaiser's tenuous (and to me unconvincing) evi- dence that most of Egypt might have been united for 150 years prior to the First Dynasty. Minor errors are scattered throughout the book. Philip Smith was not employed by the Royal Ontario Museum (p. 79); there is no such entity as the Nubian Christian Meroitic Y Group (p. 255); the sign behind King Den on p. 246 is not a boat but the hieroglyph k3, and there is no reason to believe that the Easterner portrayed in that scene is from the Red Sea Hills rather than the Sinai Peninsula; Khasekhem and Khasekhemwy are different names, not two spellings of the same name (p. 349). The bibliography is extensive and useful. O'Connor and Redford 1977 will probably never be published, and a few items, such as P. J. Ucko's Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete (1968) and Lech Krzyv- zaniak's Early Farming Cultures on the Lower Nile (1977) should have been included. Bruce G.
