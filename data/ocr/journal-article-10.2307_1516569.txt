<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOSEA AND JACOB1) BY PETER R. ACKROYD London I The Jacob material in Hosea xii consists of two passages, namely vv. 4-5 and v. 13 2). It will, however, be proper to consider a slightly larger unit in each case, and we may take vv. 3-7 in the first case and vv. 13-14 in the second. It will be convenient to take the second passage first. 13 Jacob fled to the fields of Aram and Israel servedfor a wife andfor a wife he shepherded (flocks) 14 And by a prophet Yahweh brought up Israel from Egypt and by a prophet he was shepherded. The text here is straightforward enough. Many of the commentators, finding that the Jacob tradition here used belongs chronologically in the middle of the material alluded to in vv. 4-5, have thought that the passage is out of place 3). But it is quite clear that there is no room for it in vv. 4-5, for the parallelism which we can see there between the birth tradition and the Jabbok tradition allows no insertion of the Aram tradition within it 4). Nor could it appropriately be added after v. 5. The Aram tradition of v. 13 is quite separate from the traditions of vv. 4-5 5). T. H. ROBINSON supports this point with the contention that the metrical structure of the two passages-which he regards as fragments of a poetic presen- tation of Israel's prehistory-is quite different. GERTNER comments 1) A paper read to the Society for Old Testament Study, July, 1962. 2) All references are to the Hebrew text. 3) Cf. HARPER, ICC (1905), p. 380, who places v. 13 in the middle of v. 4. Similarly, too, MAUCHLINE, IB 6, (1956), p. 703. 4) This specifically against HARPER'S (and similar) rearrangement. 5) DE BOER, NTT 1 (1947), p. 162, assumes that Hosea and his contemporaries knew a different ordering of the Jacob stories than is found in Genesis. Vetus Testamentum XIII i6</page><page sequence="2">P. R. ACKROYD on this as an example of 'homiletic arrangement' linked merely by association of ideas, in which the order of the events is presented in a midrashic manner 1). The saying of v. 13 contains two elements. In the first place it records Jacob's flight to Aram; in the second place it lays stress on his acquiring of a wife. There is nothing to clarify the reasons for his flight, nor is there any indication as to whether this form of the tradition knows or does not know the story of Jacob's acquisition of his two wives as a result of the duplicity of Laban. The use of the tradition here, as in vv. 4-5, is allusive 2). The clues to the significance of the passage would seem to lie first in the immediate context, and second in the general indications of the tradition here alluded to. In the context, in v. 14, the stress rests upon God's protective activity in regard to Israel. The general indications of the tradition point in the same direction, for both the flight to Aram and the acquiring of a wife represent the establishing of hope for the descendants of Jacob. The first links with the escape from Esau-and possibly also with the other element in the tradition which forms a basis for Jacob's journey to Aram, namely the escape from marriage with Hittite women, women of the land (Gen. xxvii 46). The acquiring of a wife (or wives) provides the ancestress for the people. The marked affinities between Hosea and Jeremiah make it natural to recall here the reference to the Rachel tribal-mother tradition (Jer. xxxi 15). Here we have the same evaluating of the Aram elements of the tradition. This interpretation would mean that Hos. xii 13 provides a counter- part to that element in the confessio fidei as found in Deut. xxvi which runs: A wandering Aramaean was my father where 'obed would appear to carry the sense both of 'roaming about' and of 'going astray', so that the idea of divine protection is involved in the confessional statement at this point. The emphasis on divine protection and providence, ensuring the future of the people, is then continued in Hosea-as also in the confessio fidei-in the description of the Exodus and wilderness events in terms of prophetic guidance, 1) 'The Masorah and the Levites. Appendix on Hosea xii' VT 10 (1960), pp. 241-284, cf. p. 275. The very interesting interpretation offered by GERTNER cannot be discussed in detail here. I am less persuaded that the order is due to midrashic treatment and consider it more probable that we have two separate tradition elements here. 2) Cf. GERTNER, esp. pp. 275 f. 246</page><page sequence="3">HOSEA AND JACOB an element in the interpretation of that tradition which Hosea shares with Amos (cf. ii 11). This positive assessment of the Jacob tradition is not by any means universally accepted. To VRIEZEN 1) the verse portrays the humi- liation of Israel, brought into servitude for the sake of a woman 2). This is a very odd interpretation when one considers that the woman in question is the tribal-mother. VAN HOONACKER 3) has a similarly unnatural interpretation. WOLFF 4) relates the reference to Jacob here to the theme of false and true worship in vv. 11-12. 'The allusion to Jacob's service "for a wife" (cf. Gen. xxix 15-30) is not intended to demonstrate his love as does Gen. xxix 20, nor the legitimacy of such a stake (Einsatz) for the winning of a wife (cf. Josh. xv 16 f., 1 Sam. xvii 25). Hosea stresses here rather, as in vv. 4 f., Jacob's deceit in his dealings with God, and here in two points: perhaps the flight itself into the fields of Aram and the servitude there in which Hosea could be alluding to Israel's subjection to alien powers (cf. v lib and xii 2); more clearly it is emphasised by repetition that Jacob undertook servitude beisaah.' 5) But is there any likelihood that this is what Hosea means at all? At the very most we might suppose that Hosea is offering an interpretation of the servitude of Jacob as in some way equivalent to Israel's servitude in Egypt-in other words not a matter of Israel's failure but a situation which provided the occasion for a divine act of salvation. It seems much more probable that Hosea is in reality making an allusion to the marvel of the divine purpose by which through such vicissitudes the patriarch was brought to prosperity and blessing. The Genesis traditions show a hero who is divinely blessed no matter what his opponents try to do to him. Laban's imposition of servitude -like Pharaoh's treatment of Israel in Egypt-looks like the defeat of God's purposes. But it is not; it is the occasion for the demon- stration of divine blessing, as the story reiterates. II It is clear that we cannot separate the treatment of the Jacob tradition in v. 13 from that in vv. 4-5. In theory there is no reason 1) 'La Tradition de Jacob dans Osee xii' Oudt. Stud. 1 (1942), pp. 64-78. 2) Op. cit., pp. 75 f. 3) Les douze petits Prophetes (1908), pp. 113-118. 4) Hosea (BK 1961), pp. 279-280. 5) A similar, though less extreme, interpretation is offered by WEISER, Das Buch der wdilf kleinen Propheten, I (ATD, 1949), p. 78 (2 1956), p. 93. 247</page><page sequence="4">P. R. ACKROYD why Hosea should not offer a positive assessment in one passage and a negative assessment in the other. In practice this may be felt to be unlikely. The almost universally agreed negative treatment of vv. 4-5 has in some cases-as we have just seen-been elaborated into a negative treatment of v. 13. But if we may more reasonably see in the Jacob allusions a preliminary to that greatest act of divine deliverance indicated in the Exodus events alluded to in v. 14, then we may wonder whether the negative assessment of w. 4-5 is correct, or whether here too there may not be a positive evaluation of the patriarchal traditions. But first we must consider the text itself. xii 3 Yahweh has a controversy with Israel 1) He will bring judgement upon Jacob in accordance with his ways according to his deeds he will requite him. 4 In the womb he overtook 2) his brother in his maturity he strove with God, 5 He lorded it over the angel and prevailed he implored him weeping. At Bethel he (i.e. God) encountered him and there he spoke with us 6 Even Yahweh God of hosts Yahweh is his name. The text raises a number of difficulties. We need not discuss what the name of Jacob originally meant 3) since popular explanation is more relevant here than philological exactness 4). The Jacob tradition provides us with two indications of popular etymology. In the de- scription of the birth of Esau and Jacob, the name is linked to ceqeb heel, because his hand was holding the heel of Esau (Gen. xxv 26). Clearly the sense is related to the immediately preceding divine oracle con- cerning the relationship between the two brothers who are two nations, for the elder will serve theyounger (Gen. xxv 23). In the story of the obtaining of Isaac's blessing for Jacob, Esau comments that Jacob is rightly named: He has overtaken (supplanted, deceived) me twice ') MT Judah, probably a re-application. 2) DE BOER, NTT 1 (1947), p. 161 translates simply 'he had hold on the heel of his brother'. 3) Cf. W. F. ALBRIGHT, From the Stone Age to Christianity (1940, 1957), p. 245; M. NOTH, 'Mari und Israel' in Alt-Festschrift (1953), esp. pp. 142 f. 4) Cf. WOLFF, op. cit., p. 274. 248</page><page sequence="5">HOSEA AND JACOB now; he took my birthright and now he has taken my blessing (Gen. xxvii 36). The exact meaning of the group of words from the root 'qb is not easy to determine. The idea of 'behind, the hinder part' appears in most of the forms. The verbal form could then have-so VRIEZEN affirms 1)-the meaning of 'follow' as in Arabic, and so literally 'to overtake', to 'supplant', and possibly also figuratively 'to deceive' as being an action which is behindhand in the bad sense 2). For our context here the important point would seem to be that the allusion is to the birth-narrative, in other words to one particular form of the tradition that Jacob gained pre-eminence although he was the younger twin. The Genesis tradition is able to provide two other accounts of how he gained pre-eminence-namely the birth-right and the blessing-but neither of them is alluded to here. In the present form of Gen. xxvii these are interwoven in Esau's words; but origi- nally they would seem to be independent statements, since we should assume that once a man has acquired primacy in the family, possessing the birth-right, he should receive the blessing of the first-born by right. The parallel to 'qb here confirms this interpretation-sarah 'to contend, strive'. Just as-mysteriously-Jacob has acquired pre- eminence even in the womb, so too he is shown to be a specially privileged person in his maturity. The rendering of 'on as 'maturity' is confirmed by the Greek translations other than the LXX, and by the Vulgate; it is in any case warranted by the parallel to beten. The LXX rendering 'v x6rLot clearly envisages 'awen 3), and may repre- sent the earliest exegesis of the passage in a negative sense, though it is more probable that the meaning of x6to? 'toil and trouble, suffering, weariness' may be intended to refer to the situation in which Jacob found himself at the time of the struggle, namely on the eve of his uncertain meeting with his brother Esau. The contest at the Jabbok leads to a blessing to a man in distress 4). 1) Op. cit., pp. 68-69. 2) Cf. becoqbah in 2 Kings x 19 which appears to be exactly equivalent to bemirmah in Gen. xxvii 36. KOEHLER, Lexicon, compares qbc rendered by LXX in Mal. iii, 8 f. by the same word trrspvtico as cqb in Gen. xxvii 36, Hos. xii 4, Jer. ix 3. But cf. DRIVER in ZAW 50, NF 9 (1932), p. 145, who compares Arab. qabaca 'rob of, take from'. The LXX rendering, connected with Ceqeb heel, appears to rest on an exegesis of the various passages. Certainly the sense of 'deceive' is inappropriate for the other occurrence of qb' in Prov. xxii 23. 3) Cf. WOLFF ad loc. 4) Cf. DE BOER NTT 1 (1947), p. 158 on the critical nature of Jacob's position at the Jabbok. 249</page><page sequence="6">P. R. ACKROYD The statement of the contest is continued in v. 5 with an elaborating of the nature of the struggle and its consequences. The MT of the verse begins with a verbal form which as it stands appears to be from the root srr, and we are presumably to regard the 'el which follows as an alternative to 'al, a common interchange. The form could equally well be pointed as wayyisar (sarah) 'he strove', repeating the idea of v. 4; the repetition would be effective and certainly in line with Hosea's style (cf. v. 13). It is supported by LXX, Aquila and Theodotion, but requires some consideration of the construction. The preposition 'et in v. 4 (cf. the use of 'im in Genesis xxxii 29) suggests the emendation of 'el to 'et in v. 5 1). But this is hazardous and too simple. We do better to retain the MT. NYBERG 2) suggested that the text had been misunderstood and that the preposition 'el conceals the divine appellative. Thus he translated: 'and the Numen (El), the angel, fought and prevailed'. This suggestion is taken up by GERTNER 3) with the omission of mal'ak as a gloss, and with srr andykl interpreted as 'God commanded him' i.e. to go to Beth-el (the meaning of srr as 'ruling, commanding' is here extended) and 'he entrusted (charged) (him)' i.e. to make an altar there. The appearance of a mal'ak in v. 5, whereas in v. 4 we have 'elohim, and in the Genesis tradition 'a man', does suggest the possibility that we have a gloss, and GERTNER comments at some length on the possible reasons for its introduction 4). We may however wonder whether it is necessary to make so much elaboration of a change which is to be found in other narratives of divine appearances, where the interchange between God and angel is to be found without explanation 5). Part of the difficulty of interpretation of this verse has arisen because of the second clause he implored him weeping, in which Jacob must be the subject. The curious feature that Jacob prevails and then weeps- thought to represent Jacob's distress and therefore conflicting directly with the immediately preceding statement of his victory- 1) So WEISER op. cit. p. 89.

The absence of the article, noted by WOLFF (p. 267) as strange, is not really a problem in view of the frequent omission of the article in Hebrew poetry, 250</page><page sequence="7">HOSEA AND JACOB has been convincingly shown by BENTZEN 1) to be a way of expressing his asking for blessing (cf. Gen. xxxii 27). He uses 'all the usual ways of imploring God for blessing' (cf. Ps. lvii 8, Mal. ii 13). BENTZEN provides a satisfactory answer to NYBERG, and in effect also makes GERTNER'S and WOLFF'S proposed interpretation unnecessary 2). The second part of v. 5 goes on to describe the outcome of Jacob's entreaty, not by an immediate statement of the giving of the blessing, but by an allusion to the meeting at Beth-el 3). The tenses here are awkward. GERTNER interprets as if the words were part of what God said to Jacob: 'he would find him, he would speak (i.e.) bless'. More simply we might take them as preterites 4), or interpret them as having a continuous past sense 'he kept on meeting, he kept on speaking', in other words as indicating that the result of the imploring of Jacob was a continually renewed relationship between God and the patriarch, and by extension with the people. WOLFF 5) notes that ;asa'a may be regarded as a technical term connected with the idea of election. This would further lead to the acceptance of the MT form (immanu rather than its emendation to 'immo (cf. LXX Syr and most commentators). The MT has the more difficult reading, but it is theologically the more significant. The interpretation of it as a 1) 'The Weeping of Jacob, Hos. xii 5a' VT 1 (1951), pp. 58 f. WOLFF knows BENTZEN'S article (cf. p. 266), but does not take account of his suggestion. He simply repeats the conventional comment (p. 275). VRIEZEN (op. cit. p. 74) inter- prets bakah wept as a reference to Gen. xxxii-'the injury which Jacob sustained' (cf. similarly DE BOER, NTT 1 (1947), p. 162, linking it with Gen. xxxi 8), and comments on he implored him that Hosea rejects the idea that Jacob could have extort.ed something from God. We may observe, however, that the motif of insistent demand upon God is one which is certainly familiar in the Old Testa- ment. The prayer of Abraham in Gen. xviii 22-23, that of Amos (vii 1-6), that of Jeremiah (e.g. xx 7-18), that of Ezekiel (iv 14), all reveal such insistence: they all show, as does the Jacob tradition, both as we have it in Genesis and as we have it in Hosea, that such an insistence is proper and theologically sound, for in fact it is to be regarded as a way of demonstrating the willingness of God to act. The divine mercy-and the same point is made in the parables of the importunate widow (Luke xviii 1-8) and the friend at midnight (Luke xi 1-8)-is as it were set in relief against the insistence of human prayer. 2) PEDERSEN, Israel III-IV (1940), p. 717 makes the angel the subject. So too does ENGNELL, Israel and the Law, Symbolae biblicae Upsaliensis 7 (1946, revised 1954) p. 28. N. SCHMIDT, 'The Numen of Penuel', JBL 45 (1926), pp. 260-279, suggests that Jacob at Penuel used a wrestling trick to disable his antagonist: 'this is suggested by Hos. xii 5 where the angel weeps and begs for mercy' (p. 267). Grammatically this is possible, but the real point lies in Jacob's obtaining blessing. 3) Hardly = the name of the deity (NYBERG, Studien, p. 95 f.). 4) Cf. G. R.

ACKROYD third person form-do the versions in fact presuppose a different text or one in which the nun is taken to be a nun energicum?-is natural enough in view of the context. WOLFF 1) considers that the first person form was due to a misunderstanding of the formyimsa'ennu. But we might ask whether this too might not be rightly construed as a first person form, the forms with nun energicum for the first person plural being possible even if unusal 2). The text would then read: At Beth-el he would meet with zus, and there he would speak with us (in the sense of 'did so repeatedly') 3). The people now is identical with Jacob then. To this v. 6 adds an apt comment drawing attention to the nature of that meeting between Yahweh and Jacob, and so between Yahweh and Jacob's descendants, which is the only basis of the relationship between Israel and her God. xii 7 But asforyou, dwell in your tents keep loyalty and justice and hope always in your God. The MT has you shall return with (by the help of?) your God. The proposed emendation 'oholeyka for 'loheyka, assumed in the above translation, involves only a very simple change of letters (we may compare perhaps 2 Sam. xx 1, 1 Kings xii 16). The MT may be due in the first instance to the influence of 'loheyka, at the end of the verse, tajub for teseb following on the initial miswriting. Such a reference to 'dwelling in tents' might be an allusion to the return to the state of semi-nomadic life which is typified by the Jacob tradition 4) (cf. v. 10 for another statement of a similar kind) 5), or possibly simply a semi-proverbial statement signifying the normal, right way of life (cf. 2 Sam. xx 22 and contrast the use of 'ohole rasa' in Ps. lxxxiv 10).

Such moralising to Jacob in that context does not accord well with the idea of divine blessing and promise which is emphasised in v. 5. III We may now ask what is the right interpretation of this passage with its allusions to the Jacob traditions. Again, as with w. 13-14, we may fairly readily set on one side suggestions that the whole passage is a gloss. As ROBINSON 1) rightly points out, a later glossator would be more likely to have followed the Genesis traditions very closely, rather than engaging in the somewhat free treatment which we have here 2). ROBINSON, however, believes that the passage is an extract from, or an abbreviated form of, a larger poetic tradition which has been utilised by the prophet 3). One argument which might be used-but so far as I am aware has not been used-against the originality of the passage is that whereas most of the references to the patriarchs in the prophets are rather colourless 4), this one is much more substantial and detailed. Such references to the patriarchal material are most often positive- to the Abraham tradition in Isa. li 2, the ancestor divinely blessed, as similarly in Ezek. xxxiii 24; in Isa. xxix 22 with its allusion to a redeeming of Abraham, the exact reference of which is not clear. Relatively frequent allusion to the Sodom and Gomorrah tradition (and its parallel Admah and Zeboiim), is, of course, of a warning nature, but this does not affect our present point. The judgement of Jerusalem in Ezek. xxvi 3, 45 is not strictly relevant. In Joshua xxiv, the forefathers of Israel beyond the river are said to have served other gods, but Abraham is described as being separated from them, and brought under the blessing of God into Canaan, and provided there with descendants. This is, as it were, an extension of the wandering Aramaean theme of Deut. xxvi, and stresses the divine blessing and 1) Op. cit. p. 47. 2) Cf. also WOLFF, op. cit. (p. 275) and VRIEZEN, op. cit.

He bases this on the use of c"lohim in v. 4, where the 'interpolator' of vv. 5-7 calls him an angel.

The reference in Isa. lxiii 16 is too obscure to admit of a certain interpretation. The nearest point of negative reference is to be seen in Jer. ix 3. The difficulty here is that our judgement of this passage will inevitably in part be determined by our interpretation of the Hosea reference. For while it is true that the phrase every brother really acts as a supplanter and every friend goes about as a slanderer provides a word-play on the root 'qb which looks suspiciously like a negative interpretation of the name Jacob 1), there is no absolute certainty that this is so. The general context in Jer. ix is a much broader one and the theme of hostility and suspicion between brothers and friends is not so unfamiliar in the Old Testament-for example in the Psalms-as to necessitate a reference to the Jacob-Esau tra- dition. Later, in Malachi i 2 ff. where we have an allusion to the Jacob- Esau traditions, we find this without any such overtone of criticism, and here in Jeremiah there are other elements present which do not seem to fit with the Jacob tradition at all. The allusion to 'tale-bearing' would fit the early part of the Joseph tradition-cf. Gen. xxxvii 2- but there does not seem to be any place for it in the Jacob material. If a reference to Jacob is present in the Jeremiah passage, this does not necessarily affect the interpretation of Hosea, though it is then the point most closely related to it. But it is more closely related to those other elements in the Jacob tradition-namely the winning of the birth-right and of the blessing on which Esau commented so bitterly (Gen. xxvii 36). These do not appear in Hosea, and so the Hosea passage must stand on its own merits. The interpretations of Hosea xii 3-7 are many and varied. PEDERSEN, commenting on the Hosea passage and comparing it with the Genesis material, says 'Hosea knew a story like this with a few different features. Curiously enough the prophet uses it as an accusation against the people' 2). Similarly, VAN HOONACKER 3) and VRIEZEN 4) viewing the Hosea passage as consisting of a dialogue between the prophet and the people, see the prophet countering the people's claims, based 1) The MT points the verbal form ya'qob, notyacaqob.

VRIEZEN (p. 64n) bases his approach on that of EERDMANS 254</page><page sequence="11">HOSEA AND JACOB as they are upon this popular tradition of Jacob's successes. This view in fact represents a compromise with the more positive inter- pretation, but it has the same idea of the rejection by the prophet of the old traditional view of Jacob. A similar view is presented by BENTZEN 1), whose interpretation of the passage we have already quoted. The assumption is that the prophet was reacting against a wrong understanding, a popular understanding, of the national religious inheritance. Israel's present condition is seen as being the natural outcome of her past. Just as Jacob deceived, so Israel does. Such a criticism does not completely accord with the presentation of the wilderness period as a period of true relationship (cf. Hosea ii), but since we can hardly require logical consistency in the teaching of a prophet, we cannot necessarily expect that there should not be two alternative emphases at different points in his preaching 2). The tradition of Jacob contains an element of delight at the deceit- fulness, the craftiness, of the tribal ancestor, which has been compared with, for example, the Odysseus tradition. Such a popular view, delighting in the way in which in one story and another Jacob suc- cessfully frustrates his opponents, is indeed the natural one, granted the kind of situation from which these stories emerge 3). The success- ful man is, to the unsophisticated mind, the one who is in receipt of such divine favour as is believed to exist. He could not be successful without it. It is a more sophisticated outlook which raises questions about the reality of this too simple analysis. To this the prophet is believed to object. Just as we have seen that it is thought that Jacob demeaned himself to serve for a woman, so he is seen here as behaving deceitfully in gaining pre-eminence in the womb, and as behaving with hybris in daring to struggle with the deity at the Jabbok, only to find himself there mastered by the divine being 4). Deceit is so much a part of the people's nature that it must (de Godsdienst van Israel I (1930)), pp. 196 ff.; The Religion of Israel (a new edition in English, 1947), p. 151: "In iv-xiv various parties speak, a change of speaker however is not indicated but must be gathered from the context. As a rule God himself spoke, but some passages were said by the people or the prophet". Cf. also p. 154.

WOLFF'S ela- borate exegesis of the passage is a recent presentation of this negative view 1). The contention of God indicated in xii 3 is explained in the whole history of the people, in Jacob himself; parallel with this is the development of thought in v. 8 where Israel is described in terms of deceitful trading practice. An alternative view of the material is that represented by DE BOER. He maintains that the 'prophet denies that Jacob's god is Jhwh'. 'He declaims against the syncretism popular already in his days, which identifies the god of Moses with the gods of the patriarchs' 2). To Hosea 'the god of Bet'el is ... the god of the House of Idolatry'. 'The god of Bet'el is the god of Jacob who overreaches his brother, who strove with an 'el, who wept and asked for grace in Bet'el. Just as the idol is a god who is not reliable, so the people of the cult of this god are not trustworthy' (p. 162). The tradition is thus repudiated, in DE BOER's view, because it is non-Yahwistic 3). If Hosea really made such a protest against the ancestral cults, it was presumably an isolated one which failed to impress itself upon the main religious tradition of the Old Testament. For whatever our analysis of the historical relationship between the religion of the pre-Exodus period and that of the later history, it is clear that Israel did not think of these as separable. One of the central features of the Exodus tradition is the identity of the God of Abraham, Isaac and GERTNER, op. cit. p. 276n-though GERTNER does not decide whether the inter- pretation should be negative or positive. Cf. also for negative interpretation HARPER, op. cit. p. 379 f. taking v. 4a as blame, and vv. 4b-7 as occupied with the praise of Israel (incl. v. 13). Such a double interpretation is also given by MAUCHLINE, op. cit. p. 696: "If the purpose of this section was to show that Israel's evil went back even to the time of the patriarchs (cf. Isa. xliii 27) and that Jacob himself was guilty of deceit and guile even from birth, the purpose is not served by the statements that are made about Jacob. Guile and presumption are charged against him, but spiritual persistence and contrition are credited to him". Cf. also N6TSCHER, Zwolfprophetenbuch (1954), pp. 33 f. BUBER, op. cit. p. 28, speaks of 'the shameful nature of Jacob's name'. ') Op. cit. pp. 275, 282 ff. 2) Op. cit. p. 163. 3) There is some similarity to this in the view of REINES, 'Hosea xii 1' JJS 2 (1950-51), pp. 156-7, where he notes what he sees as references to the cults asso- ciated with the ancestors as being opposed by true monotheism represented by the religion of Moses (cf. REINES in Sinai XI 7-8, p. 43). 'Therefore, he ironically refers to Jacob's meeting and wrestling with 'lohim (v. 4) whose designation as malakh may be a later substitute (possibly originally = demon) and who in the prophet's view signifies the objects (b'calim) which the nation was still worshipping' (p. 157). 256</page><page sequence="13">HOSEA AND JACOB Jacob with the God of Moses. While it is true that the prominent position occupied by the patriarchs as examples of faith and piety belongs to a later period than the prophets-as witness the relative absence of references to them in the prophets and the similar relative paucity of reference in the psalms )-the patriarchal stories them- selves are clearly earlier than the prophets, and the few allusions which we have already noted to patriarchal blessing by God indicate that a positive view was normal. The same point has been noted in the confessio fidei. Hosea's polemic against Bethel does not appear to be based upon a belief that the God worshipped there was an alien deity 2), but rather that Israel has lost touch with the reality of the God who revealed himself there. Thus, for example, in iv 5 the second part of the verse, which is textually clear enough, enjoins that men should not go up to Beth-awen (i.e. Beth'el, so nicknamed by the prophet), nor swear 'As Yahweh lives'. The people are better off without worship than if they engage in worship in unfit condition and so incur the wrath of the deity. The prophet envisages them as worshipping Yahweh, though in such a way as to bring disaster upon themselves. IV Neither of these interpretations appears to do natural justice to the text itself, nor to the nature of the tradition which is here evoked by the prophet 3). The assumption is made that at some point in the people's history-as exemplified in Hosea-the deceitfulness of Jacob began to be felt as a matter of embarrassment. Yet the Jacob stories are told virtually without embellishment; in their final form, set within the P material, they carry no overtones of condemnation 4). 1) Cf. LAUHA, Die Geschichtsmotive in den Alttestamentlichen Psalmen (Annales Acad. Scientiarium Fennicae, B 56 i, 1945). 2) Contrary to what is affirmed, for example, by ENGNELL, op. cit. p. 29. 3) It is not possible here to enter into'a full discussion of the extent of this evocation. Cf. DE BOER, op. cit. p. 162, and GERTNER, op. cit. pp. 274 ff. 4) WOLFF, op. cit. (p. 274), maintains that 'the later narrative of the stealthy obtaining of the blessing by Jacob links together in the mouth of Esau the name of Jacob and the word Cqb, (Gen. xxvii 36) as is later done in Jer. (ix 3). (Imme- diately before Gen. xxvii 35 denotes Jacob's behaviour as mirmah . ..)'. But we may wonder whether this is a right assessment of the point. From the point of view of Esau, the action of Jacob may well be reprehensible; but did the reader of the story put himself in Esau's place? and is Isaac's comment really one of condemnation, or does it not imply that Isaac is in fact acknowledging that what Jacob has done was in a sense unavoidable because evidently divinely ordained? Applying modern moral criteria here does not help our understanding. Of course 257</page><page sequence="14">P. R. ACKROYD The popular tales were evidently accepted. The allusion in Malachi i (echoed by Paul in Romans ix, where in fact the birth story is shown to fit into the realities of a divine purpose which does not work merely in moral categories, cf. vv. 10-13) shows the acceptance of the choice of Jacob and its use as an argument by the prophet. The writer to the Hebrews accepts the propriety of the prior blessing of Jacob- he alludes also to the blessing of Esau but does not comment in any way on the facts of the tradition (xi 20). There are markedly similar features in the Davidic traditions, and even the tendencies of some early Christian presentations of the crucifixion-the deceiving of the devil-suggests that what we see as deception the ancient world could see as the result of divine favour and blessing. Examples of this could, no doubt, be multiplied. That Jacob the younger son gained pre-eminence over the older twin was not to be seen as wrongful supplanting of the true heir 1); it was the intention of God. (A similar motif is to be found in the Tamar narrative of Gen. xxxviii 27-30). That Esau sold his birthright simply presents the same essential fact in another form (Gen. xxv 29-34), and the narrator comments that Esau despised his birthright. That Jacob managed to gain the blessing for himself is again a presentation of the mystery of divine favour, for had God not been with Jacob and Rebekah, Isaac would certainly not have been deceived. He was moved by a divine force which was stronger than his natural recognition of Jacob's voice, just as Jacob himself on his death-bed was to cross his hands to bless the sons of Joseph and give the pre-eminence to the younger over the elder. The tradition itself is quite clear. Success is divinely ordained, and must be seen as the mark of divine favour. Is it likely that Hosea in using the tradition is saying: "The story which you love is not one of which you should be proud, for it is a story of deceit. You are condemned because you are one with your father Jacob in your falsity"? Is it not more likely that he is saying: "The success of your father Jacob was due to divine favour, and to the closeness of rela- tionship which was his with God"? mirmah normally has a bad sense in the Old Testament, but we may observe that the not dissimilar use of be'oqbah in II Kings x 19 does not imply any blame on the conduct of Jehu. 1) S. R. DRIVER'S comment (Genesis, (1904), p. 295) is a little naive: he refers to 'the ambition shewn by Jacob to secure pre-eminence even in the womb'- which is an idea difficult to entertain. 258</page><page sequence="15">HOSEA AND JACOB In the oracle of xii 4-5 we have a statement of the Jacob tradition. The emphasis lies upon the mysterious nature of the divine purpose. The contrast and comparison are drawn between the child in the womb who 'overtakes' his brother, who there by divine favour wins the priority, and the man in his maturity who strives with God, overcomes the angel of God. We cannot be sure of the exact nature of the tradition which was known to Hosea, though we must obvious- ly be cautious of allowing our knowledge of the limited though rich Genesis tradition to define our interpretation of what Hosea says (Cf. WOLFF, p. 274). The use of the verb 'aqab provides a clear link to the naming of Jacob in Gen. xxv 26, but we cannot necessarily assume that precisely the same naming tradition is here used, since we know of other cases in which more than one tradition exists to explain the same name. The passage continues with reference again to the overcoming of the angel, and to the weeping entreaty and the encounter between God and Jacob. There is no allusion in Gen. xxxii to weeping. Hosea has here a richer tradition and emphasises the prevailing of Jacob upon the divine being, here described both as God and as angel, to grant blessing. The comparison is further drawn between this divine blessing and the meeting and speaking at Beth-el. The events are in an order which differs from that of Genesis, but the point lies in the effectiveness with which the various moments of divine-human encounter are suggested. The divine blessing which gave Jacob precedence over his brother gave him also victory over his divine opponent at Jabbok; the same God who thus showed favour in blessing had intimate contact with Jacob at Beth-el. Contrasted with the indications of divine willingness to bless and protect, exemplified in Israel's ancestor, is the marked unfaithfulness of the present community. The recall of the past points the responsibility of the present 1). 1) References in this study have been made almost entirely to the most recent literature on the subject, where the negative view has been almost universally accepted. Older commentators do not necessarily follow this line. A positive view is found in Jerome (cf. the footnote in KNox's translation of Hosea and cf. GERT- NER, op. Cit. p. 276 n, who leaves the matter open). Stress is laid frequently upon the miraculous nature of Jacob's primacy, which must have been due to divine blessing and purpose. Cf. PoLus (Matthew Poole), Synopsis criticorum... III (Utrecht, 1685), p. 1745 and (John PEARSON), Critici Sacri IV (Amsterdam, 1698), cols. 143 ff. I hope subsequently to investigate more fully the exegesis of this section. 259</page></plain_text>
