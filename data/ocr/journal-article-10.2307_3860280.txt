INTRODUCTION The work on which the following paper is based was done in the laboratory of the Department of P;tholcogy, Cambridge, by kind permission of Prof. H. R. Dean, and in the tIemorial Ophthalmic Laboratory, Giza, Egypt. I wish to exipress my thanks to the skaffs of these two laboratories for rrery great assistance and much patience. l!Fote on bacterzal papillae Papillae are minute projections which appear on colonies of bacteria growing on agar plates about the 3rd or 4th day of incubation. They occur probably on all bacterial coloniesS but have been studied chiefly on. members of the coli, typhoid and dysentery groups. If a plate bearing colonies of BaczZl?ss cols- contmunts or B. dysentertae Flexner is held up to the light on the 3rd or 4th day and examined with a hand lens giving x 10 magnification, the papillae ca,n be seen by transmitted light as minute shining bright spots about 0 05 mm. in diameter. They are generally situated toward the centres of the colonies. Durin the next 2 days these spots increase in size to 0 25 or O 50 mm. a,nd definitely project above the surfa.ce. By transmitted light they are golden by reflected lig:ht they are grey-white projections on the surface. They may grow out over the surface of the colony to its margin. On the other hand, their growth may be arrested earlierS when they measure only 0 10 mm. Papillae vary greatly in number. There may be only one or two on a numlber of colonies or there may be so many that they cover half the surface of any colony. In some bacterial species obvious variations take place in the papillae if the agar plate contains a sugar sueh as lactose or saccharose. In fact, it was this Ecower of variation which first drew attention to these minute structures. This happened in the case of a non-lactose fermenter, B. coli-mutbtle which was growing on a plate containing lactose with litmus as an indicator. The alkaIine colonies were of course tinged blue, and on them minute red papillae appeared which were found to consist of lactose fermenters. Suboulturas frorn these red papillae on to lactose plates gave rise to colonies of two kinds blue which again formed red papillae, and red whieh gave origin to a permanently lactose-fermenting strain. With these observations, which were pub- lished by Massini in 1907, began the scientific study of bacterial variation. After this first paper the subject of bacterial papillae has been studied by the following :* Burok (1908) repeated and confirmed Massini's work on B. cols-mutabile. Reiner Miiller (1909a, b) also worked at the same species. In addition, he fovand three strains of eoli- form bacteria which formed papillae with variation on arabinose agar pla,tes, and he discovered that B. typhosus, if grown on agar with isodulcite, formed white colonies with red papillae which on suboulture gave red and white colonies. In a later paper ( 1911 ) he stated that the reddening of the papillae in this latter case was not due to acid formation; neverthe- * Early work bzz Twort and Goodman was conducted by cultllre in fluid media only.</page><page sequence="2">332 Experiments on adaptive variation and rejuvenation less, the parent white colonies were less robust than their red descendants, a fact which Muller attributed to blocking of receptors by isodulcite and consequent starvation of the white strain, while the red strain had overcome this weakness. This explanation appears to be an anticipation of modern views on bacteriostasis by sulphonamides. Burri &amp; Duggeli (1909) and Burri alone (1910) described a coliform grass bacillus Bactertuns tm- perfectvqn which does not originally ferment sac- cha.rose, but which when grown on agar plates with this sugar forms a saccharose-fermenting strain in papillae. Baerthlein (1911, 1912) again studied B. col- mutabtle, confirming previous work. He noted that the red character usually remained constant after growth on non-lactose media, but that atavistic re- gression to white might occur after growth on agar plates for a week or more. Penfold ( 1911 ), continuing work which Twort had begun in fluid culture media, found that if B. typ7zos?&gt;s is grown on pla,tes containing dulcite, aU red dulcite- fermenting strain arises in the papillae. Bernha,rdt &amp; Markoff ( 1912), investigating a strain of B. dyserbterzae Flexner from monkeys, found that it did not originally ferment maltose but acquired the power to do so by variation in papillae when grown on maltose agar. This red-to-maltose strain reverted to white after passage through a monkey. They also found that B. colz-m?tabtle did occasion- ally revert from red to white on animal passage. Baerthlein ( 1918) summarized the papillary varia- tions which he found under the following heads: (1) Variation in size arld shape of colonies, their pigmentation and gelatinous character. (2) Variation in form of the individual bacteria- length, breadth, staining power, etc. (3) Variation in their powers of fermentation. (4) Variation in serum reaction. (5) Variation in virulence. He also found that irreversibility is never absolute, since return can generally be caused by prolonged stimulation or anima,l passage. Toeniessen ( 1920, 1921 ) studied va,riation in Friedlander's bacillus. The present writer (Stewart, 1924) studied papil- lary va.riation in B. coli-mutabtle, B. paracolon, B. typhosus, B. dysenter?ae Flexner, and B. actdz-lacttcz Huppe. He found B. cols-m?&gt;tabtle variable to lac- tose, B. paracolon variable to lactose and to sac- charose, B. typhos?s and B. actdi-lacttcz to dulcite, and B. dysenterioae Flexner to maltose. The varia,tions fall into two very definite groups: (1) In B. coli,- mutabtle, B. acsd?,-lactiyc? and B. typhos?s they take place constantly after a regular short exposure (of two to five days) to the sugar in question. (2) In B. paracolon and B. dysenterzae, on the other hand, the first occurrence of the variation takes place rarely, in perhaps one single papilla after long exposure (of 3-6 weeks). But descendants of this first variant papilla are regula,r in frequent variation. StewaJrt also described a race of B. coli-mutabile which formed a yellow pigmented variant in addition to the lactose fermenter. Stewart (1926) suggested that the white or non- lactose-fermenting form of B. colz-mutabile fails to ferment lactose not through absence of a ferment but through the action of an inhibitory factor (since the negative character is dominant over the positive in the white form). This view has been upheld by the work of Deere, Dulaney &amp; Michelson (1936) and Deere ( 1939), who found that the ferment lactase is present in the white form but that it is inhibited by some unknown cause. The entire subject of bacterial papillae, their biological significance and the variations which arise in them has, however, received little attention from bacteriologists. They are not mentioned in any text- book in the English language and only in two of the larger works of reference. Prevtous paper on sulphonamtde-ressstcbnt strains In a previous paper the present writer (Stewart, 1947) has shown that B. dysentertae Flesner, in de- veloping resistant strains during culture on sulphon- amide mediaU, conforms to the pattern of Massini's variation in B. col-m?tabxle (Massini, 1907) in the following manner: Colonies of bacilli grown on agar plates which con- tain sulphanilamide (SA) 1/20,000 form papillae or secondary colonies from the 3rd day onward. If suboultures are made from these papilla.e on to pla.tes containing SA 1/10,000, colonies of two types result: (1) large and resistant, composed of bacilli which are able to grow orl plates of sodiurn sulpha- cetamide (SSAC) 1/20,000; (2) small and non-re^ sistant, not able to grow on SSAC 1/20,000.* On the other hand, suboultures not from papilla,e but from the growing margins of the primary colonies on SA 1/20,000 contain no resistant forms. Resistant strains keep their character after long growth on drug-free media. The change from norl-resistant to resistant takes place by discontinuous variation, the new, variant type making its appearance suddenly in comparly with the original unmodified type, from which it is at once sharply distinguished. Purpose of the present paper In the present paper further observations in support of these views will be described, and it will be shown that there is no gra.dual and equal increase of resistance in the whole of a bacterial population exposed to sulphonamides, and that any appearance * Experience has shown that ability to grow freely on SSAC 1/20,000 after 24 hr. incubation is a good test of increased resistance to sulphonamides.</page><page sequence="3">F.

A bacterium if sown th?,ckly on a plate containing SA may be able to grow in a concentration of the drug which would prevent growth of a thinner inoculum. A non- resistant strain may also be able to grow if sown in company with resistant cells.

Techntcal methods (1) Spec?&gt;al culture medta for expertrnents wtth sul- phonamtdes I have found that the omission of peptone from the usual culture media avoids anti-SA action without seriously affecting their power to nourish B. dysen- terzae Flexner. Peptone-free media. have therefore been used whenever SA was to be added. I,emco broth is the basis of such media. It con- sists of: Lab. Lemco lO; sodium chloride 5; water 1000. Heat at 100° C. for 30 min. Neutralize at 37° C. He(t again 30 min. Filter through paper and adjust to pH 7-4. Autoclave 30 min. at 10 lb. pressure. I,emco agar Lemco hroth with the addition of agar 2 %. (2) Plat?,ng Agar medium for plating in all experiments, both with SA and other drugs, was put up in 18 c.c. quantities in screw-cap bottles. It was thus easy to calc ulate the amount of drug which ha,d to be added. The drugs, SA, acriflavine aUnd argyrol, were made up in strengths 1/500 or 1/1000 in glass-distilled water and autoclaved at 10 lb. pressure for 30 min. Neosalvarsa,n, 0-6 g., waUs dissolved in 15 c.c. of sterile distilled water, giving a strength of 1/25. This solution kept well in a frigidaire without precipi- tating and was diluted when required, 0*2 c.c. in 2-5 c.c. of distilled water giving a concentra.tion of 1/322*5. The drugs were added to the melted agar at a temperature of 50° C., and the resultant medium was poured and dried in the usual way. For inocula- tion of plates bacteria were taken from 24 hr. cultures in drug-free broth, 5 loops were added to 2 5 c.c. of Ringer/4 in a screw-cap bottle and well shaken. Two loops ofthis suspension were then spread on each plate with a right-angled glass spreader. The loop which I used contained an average of 0*0016 c.c., therefore the Ringer suspension was a dilution of 1/300 of the broth culture. (3) Pqxre ltnes Pure lines can be established beyond doubt in the colt and dysentery groups by dilution of a broth culture in Ringer/4 and vigorous shaking, followed byplatingon a non-selectisTe medium lStewart, 1942, 1944) . Two loops of the Ringer suspension are spread with a right-angled glass spreader on a pair of plates. All strains used by me were purified by plating on at least two successive plates of drug-free nutrient agar. (4) Test for reststance to sulphonamq&gt;des A. Experienee has shown that a good test for in- creased resistance after culture in SA media consists of plating the bacteria on agar plates containing: (a) SA l!lo,ooo, (b) SSAC 1!20,000 and (c) SSAC 1/10,000. Strains of increased resistance will grow on (a) and (b) and possibly on (c), while strains which have not previously been in contact with SA or which have not increased in resistance in spite of contact with SA may grow on (a) but will not grow on (b) or (c). B. Tttratzon. A series of plugged test-tubes measuring (internal diameter) 13 x 125 mm., or of centrifuge tubes 21 x 93 mm., are put up, each con- taining 5-5 c.c. of broth, which has a depth in the test-tubes of 40 mm. (Lemco broth is used for SA experiments, ordina.ry broth for others. ) These tubes are autoclaved at 10 lb. pressure for 30 min., and the contained broth is then reckoned as 5 c.c. The drug to be used is aUdded from a sterilized solution ( 1/250, 1/500 or 1/1000) kept in a screw-cap bottle. The series used for SA was generally 1/34,000, 1/21,000, 1/15,000, 1/13,000, 1/10,500, 1/8800, 1/7600, 1/6700, 1/6000, 1/5500. Bacteria were added from a sus- pension in Ringer/4 containing 5 loops of a 24 hr. broth culture in 2-5 c.c. of Ringer. Two loops of this suspension were added to each titration tube. The series was then incubated for 24 hr., read and re- corded as visible growth (a moving shimmer when shaken in light against aW black background) marked + or no growth (0) . * II.

(D) Chain cultures in broth tubes with SA (Tables 1 and2). * Note that the aUppearanc0 of visible growth at 24 hr. depends to some extent on the numbers of viable cells inoculated. A mixture of resistant and non-resistant cells, as in the unanalysed descendants of a papilla may therefore give an intermediate reading. Different readings may also result from difference of thickness of growth in 24 hr. broth cultures of the same organism.</page><page sequence="4">Experiments on adaptive vartation and rejuvenatton 334 strength would difEerentiate resistant bom non- resistsUnt strains. ) The plates :fFom both papillary and marginal strains showed large colonies of Q 5 mm diameter and small colonies 0 1 mm. after 24 hr. The numerical proportion of large to small was, however, very different on the two plates, on the papillary plate large lso small werf3 as 20: 1 on the marginal plate as 1 100.

Four purified strairls were then established by pieking off separate oolonies into drug-free hroth, viz. papillary large and small, a,nd marginal large and small, esnd these four strains were then som7n on plates containing SSAC 1120aD00 and 1/10,000. Pa?illary large grew on the former but not on the latter, while the other three strairss did nof grow on either. Therefore the papillae on the primary plate had developed a resistant strain alongside the origirlal non-resistant strain. Note. This ease differs £rom that described in Exp. 1, where the suboultllres from papillae con- tained resis1;ant cells orlly. The difference between resistant and non-resistant cells was so great in Exp. 1 that the norl-resistant were completely over- grown on. a rrledium containing SA, i.e. in the papillae of the prima/ry plate. B. Cc6n a strcwtn of Flerner's bacillus whtch has become reststant to SA develop a higher degree oJreststartce tn a second step 3f tt tS yrown on ayar contatnzng a hzyEer percentaye of SA 2 The possibility of such an occurren&lt;3e is suggested by the behaariour of certain strains of B. typhosus if they are sown on plates of McConkey's medIum con- taining duleite instead of lactose (StewartS 1927, p. 69). ()n the first sowigg they form white colonies which after some days bear pink papillae. Sub- cultes on to the same medium om these papillae give separate white and pink colonies, the latter bsaring dark red papillae. SubouItures from these dark red papillae give pink arld dark red colonies. If the three strains white, pink and dark rsd are mised and sown on a duleito plateS the three types of colony arise perictly distinct and with no inter- mediate gradation of colovlr. Thus full fermentation of dulcite is achieved in two distinct steps. EzperimerLt 3 To test whether B. dysentertae Flexner could achieve a second step exaltation of resistance to SA, a strain of R8 was grown on agar containing SA lJ20i000 (see E:xp. 1 aboxre). It developed a resIstant strain (R. 831), which on titration grew irl SA 1/5800, but not in l/4417. (The original no-contact strain grew in SA 1134,00Q and failed irl 1/2lS00Q.) R 831 was then plated on agar aontaining SA l/650Q, the colonies on which developed papillae on the 4th day. These were picked off into broth which was sown on agar containmg the same strength of SA viz. l/6500. A. S?&gt;ngte cultures orb ptates I shall record two examples of experiments out of a rlumber performed. Experfrnent 1 A race of B. dysenterzale Flexner, isolated in Cairo and purified by plating gave bypieal sugar reactions viz. lactose OS glucose A, maltose O, mannite A. It was numbered R 8. (a) Prtrnczry plate. A no-contact strain (see p. 333) was sown on a plate of Lemeo agar contairling SA to a strenflh of 1/20fl000. AfTer 24 hr. incubation about 250 delicate colourless colonies appeared, measuring 0 50-0 75 mm. with markedly irregular star-shaped outlines. (This form of colony is not the rough variation, since descerldarlts on drug-free media resume smooth rourld outlines.) (b) Separ6vn of strtxsfrom Apptllae andfrom the non-papt17ury marn On the 3rd day of incubation the star-shaped colorlies were studded with papillaes g(}lden by transmitted light, measurirlg 0 25 0-30mm. Suboultures into drug-free broth were made from these papillae and from the margins of colonies as far removed from the papillae as possible. These two strains were purified by plating on agar with SA 1/20,000. On this medium oolonies of the papillary strairl were robust and circular, mea,suringK 0&lt;5-1*0 mm. Colonies of the marginal strain were again delicate and star-shapedS 0 25-0 75 mm. (c) Tttratiox of no-corbtct, marnal and ppzZv6ry strains of R 8. These three strains wera then titrated in bubes of Lemco broth containing SA in concentra- tion from 1/34/000 to 1/5000. The titration tubes were read after inoubation for 24 hr. with the bllowing results The no-contact and rnarginal strains grew up to, but not beyond, 1/34t000. The papillary strain R 831 grew up to 1/5800. The papillae therebre contained resistant cells while the cells from the margins were still non- resistant. The v&amp;riation to increased resistance had taken place only in the papillae artd was ohviously discontinuous. There was no general increase of resistance of a11 cells exposed to the drug.

STEWART 335 The lcargest colony which appeared on this medium wa,s picked off to give &lt;^ pure highly resist&gt;ant strain (R 966) if such a one had been formed, while the un- analysed descendcants of the papillae were kept in culture (R955) in c&lt;ase the largest colony (R966) should not prove most resistant. The two strains, R 966 &lt;and R 955, were then titr&lt;ated (in centrifuge tubes 21 x 93 mm.) in com- parison with the original resistcant strain (R 831 ) . In one experiment both R966 and R831 grew in SA 1/6055 but not in 1/5045, showing thcat R 966 hcad not aclhieved a second increase of resistance. In another ex-periment R 955 (the uncanalysed pa.pilLary mixed strain) aUnd R 831 both grew in 1/5045. I found thcat titration of resist&lt;ant strains in Lemco broth con- tcaining high concentrations of SA did not always give aJn upper limit. I therefore titrated the mixed pcapillcary strain R 955 and the origincal resista,nt strain R 831 on plates contcaining SSAC which gives more cle&lt;ar-cut results than SA. The series of plates contained SSAC in the following concentra,tions: 1/20,000, 1/15,500, 1/10,500, 1/8000, 1/740O, 1/6500, l/.'S800. There was no consistent difference of growth in the two strains; the size of the colonies WcebS approxim&lt;ately equcal up to 1/8000 and both strains produced only minute irregulcar scraps of growth me&gt;asuring 0 05 mm. on SSAC 1/6500 and l/;j800. Eapertment 4 Another resistant strain of Flexner's bacillus which was able to grow on pl&lt;ates containing SSAC 1/20,000 was sown on a pl&lt;ate containing SA 1/7000. Pa,pillae appe&lt;ared on the 4th day and were picked off int;o broth. The strain thus formed failed to grow on plcttes containing SSAC 1/10,000. Therefore neither of these resistant races appeared to be able to form a. second-step strain of higher resisting power. C. Stegle cultures tn tubes of Lernco broth Expertenent 5 (a) The prtmary cutture consisted of Lemco broth 10 c.c. containing SA 1/10,000 in a boiling tube 22 x 175 mm. (as advocated by Kirby &amp; Rantz, 1943). The same race, R 18, as in Exp. 2 was inocu- lated and the tubes incubated for 5 days. (b) Separatton of a reststtny var?,ant from an ?&gt;n- rnod tf ed non -resistant f ortn . The primary culture after suitable dilution was sown on a plate of Lemco agar containing SA 1/20,000. Colonies which appeared were large type 1 0-2 0 mm. and small type 0 1- 0- 2 mm. The large type proved itself capable of growing on plates containing SA 1/10,000 and SSAC 1/20,00() but not on SSAC 1/10,000, while the small type grew on SA 1/10,000 but not on SSAC 1/20,000 or l/I0,000. Therefore the large type was a resisting J. Eygiene 46 variant while the small type was the unmodified original strain. ExperiXrnyent 6 Flexner's bacillus was grown in Lemeo bouillon, 10 e.e. in a boiling tube measuring 22 x 175 mm., with SA added to give a eoneentration of 1/10,000. On the 5th day a suboulture was made on a drug-free nutrient agar slope which was then plated on Lemco agar with SA 1/20,000. Colonies of large type (1a0- 2-0 mm.) and of small type (0-1-0-2 mm.) resulted. The large type proved resistant by growing on SA 1/10,000 and on SSAC 1/20,000, while the small type grew on SA 1/10,000 but not on SSAC 1/20,000. D. Chain cultures tn Lemco broth Kirby &amp; Rantz (1943) have worked out a method of estimating resista.nce to SA by the opaeity of standard broth cultures read by means of a speetro- photometer at different times during 24 hr. ineuba- tion. Each eulture consisted of 10 e.e. of standard broth (containing ammonium sulphate, glueose and easaminoaeids) in a boiling tube 22 x 175 mm., with the addition of SA to a coneentration of 1/10,000. With these tubes the authors ma.de ehain eultures of a strain of Escherichta cols (sive B. coli-cornrn?snts) from the blood in a case of pyelonephritis. Eaeh link of the chain was incubated 24 hr. and then suboultured into the next link. The authors report as follows: 'During the first day, following the initial lag period, there was marked inhibition of growth in a11 tubes eontaining sulphonamides. Thereafter there was a gradual daily development of resistance the progress of which is indicated at intervals of 2-3 days on the eharts. The organisms became maximally resistant about the 10th or 12th day. Thereafter transferring them for 20 more days did not produce any greater degree of resistanee. Further, no loss of resistanee was ob- served after transferring resistant organisms to drug-free media.' The authors do not appear to have plated the links of the ehain on SA 1/20,000 or 1/10?000 to find out the eomposition of the baeterial population at sue- eessive stages. I have therefore made similar ehain eultures and plated eaeh suecessive link, at the end of its 24 hr. ineubation, on to Lemeo agar containing SA 1/10,000. Strains isolated were then tested (a) by titration in tubes of Lemco broth eontaining SA in eoncentrations from 1/13,000 to 1/5000 (Table 1) or (b) by plating on agar containing SSAC 1/20,000 (Table 2). Theplan andtheresults oftheseexperiments eanbe followed most readily by referring to Tables 1 and 2.

These daily links are shown in column (1) ma,rked I-VII. Link I was inoculated with two loops of a 24 hr. broth culture of B. dysenterzae Flexner, and was then incubated for 24 hr. One loop was then transferred to link II and one to a tube of drug-free peptone broth marked I a in column 2. I a was incuba.ted for 24 hr. and then plated after dilution in Ringer/4 ( 2 loops in 2- 5 c.c. ). Two loops of this Ringer dilution were spread on a plate of Lemco agar containing SA 1/10,000 marked Ib in column 3. This plate was examined after 24 hr. incubation, the colonies being counted and classed as large (L) or small (S). The numerical ratio of L to S is shown in column 5. At least one colony of each type was then picked off into a tube of drug-free broth which was incubated for 24 hr. and the result, growth ( + ) or no growth (0), recorded in column 6. It will be seen that the small colonies of links IV, V and VII failed to grow in drug- free broth although as many as six colonies were picked off from each plate of column 3. It was there- fore not possible to titrate them, but there can be no doubt that they were non-resistant since their vitality had been so reduced on the plates containing SA 1/10,000 that they could not furnish viable sub- cultures. The strains thus established in drug-free broth, column 6, were then titrated in tubes each containing 5 c.c. of Lemco broth to which had been added SA to the strength shown in columns 7-12. The results were read after 24 hr. In addition to the pure strains L and S isolated on the plates of column 3, the mixed cultures I a and II a were also titrated, since I realizead that if only a few cells of links I and II had become resistant they would probably not be picked out on the plates of column 3, while they might be able to show themselves if I a and II a were titrated in their crude state. Results The figures from the strains L and S, I-VII, should be compared with the no-contact strain (line 1 ) which is not able to grow in 1/8800 (column 9) . Link I. There were very few L colorlies on the plate Ib (line 3), and the L strain which was titrated proved non-resistant (unable to grow in 1/7650). On the other hand, Ia unanalysed (line 2) can grow in 1/7650, showing that a few cells had become resistant in Ia. S colonies were very numerous and the strain titrated was non-resistant, i.e. unable to grow in 1/10,500. Therefore the great bulk of the cells re- mained unmodified in link I. Link II. L colonies were more numerous on the plate IIb (line 6), but the L colony which was picked out still proved non-resistant, i.e. unable to grow in SA 1/7650, while IIa unanalysed grew in this strength (line 5). (The question whether the colony chosen as L would or would not be representa,tive is of course one of arithmetical chance.) S was still predominant (line 7) and non-resistant, i.e. una,ble to grow in SA 1/8800. Link III. L and S colonies (column 4) were now equal in number (column 5). The L colony chosen was emphatically resistant (line 8, column 11 ) . S forms were still readily isolated (line 9) and proved non-resistant (column 9). Link IV. L colonies predominated in column 5, line 10, andgrewin SA 1/5050 (column 12). S colonies, although still present (line 11, column 5), could not be isolated. They were so weak that they failed to grow in drug-free broth (column 6, line 11). Link V. L colonies were mlmerous and resistant (line 12, column 12). S, although apparently more numerous, failed in drug-free suboulture (line 13, column 6). Link VI. L colonies were numerous and resistant. The S strain was again isolated (line 15, column 6) and proved non-resistant (column 8). Link VII. L colonies were numerous and resistant, S colonies were present but were not isolated (line 17, column 6). Sumrnary of Table 1. Resistant forms appeared in IIIa after 3 days' growth in SA 1/10,000, but were actually present in small numbers at the end of the first day. Non-resistant forms have been demonstrated by titration in link VI after 6 days' growth in SA 1/10,000. They are unable at any link stage (except II, column 8, line 7) to effect lodgement (when iso- lated) in SA 1/10,000, therefore they are emphaticaUlly non-resistant. Their persistence in the link tubes (columrl 1 ) was due to the support given by satellite a.ction of the mixture in which they are growing. Note. The link tubes II-VII were each inoculated with one loop undiluted of its predecessor, while the titraUtion tubes were inoculated with one loop of a dilution in Ringer amounting to 1/3000 (2 loops in 2-5 c.c.). Expertrnent 8 (Table 2) Columns 1-6 of Table 2 are the same as in Table 1, except that the link tubes contained SA 1/20,000. The L and S strains were then tested by plating on SSAC 1/20,000 (column 7 and 8) after diluting a 24 hr. broth culture in Ringer/4. The results were the same as in Table 1. Resistant forms did not appea.r in the first 2 days. Both Ib L and S and IIb L were unable to grow on SSAC 1/20,000, colurnn 7, while the colony chosen for II b S wa.s not via.ble in drug-free broth. Resistant forms did appear however on plates IIIb, IVb and Vb as L colonies which, after growing readily in drug-free broth (column 6), grow also on plates of SSAC 1/20,000 (column 7) to colonies measuring 0 5 mm. at 24 hr.</page><page sequence="7">F.

But this rule is not absolute, since the size of aW colony may be determined by other factors as well as resistance. For example, non-resistant cells may form an L colony by satellite action (Table 1, Ib, L) and resistants may form an S colony for some other reason (TaUble 2, IVb, S). In judging titration results the caution given in the introduction (footnote, p. 333) should be borne in mind, especially in rega.rd to unanalysed strains and intermediate readings. The latter do not belie discontinuity of variation. There is no reason to assume that bacteria in papillae undergoing discontinuous variation under the impact of a drug will necessarily all achieve resistance at precisely the same level. Differences in titration value of different newly formed resistant strains in Table 1, lines 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16, and Table 3, lines 10, 11, 14 suggest that they reach different levels. 22-2</page><page sequence="8">r \  338 Experirnyents on adaptsve variatton and reuuvenatzon There is no general and equal increase of resistance afSecting all the cells exposed to sulphanilamide, but a discontinuous variation to resistance affecting only a proportion of the cells.

Summary The resuIts in Table 2 agree with those in Table 1, resistant strains appearing after 72 hr. and non- resistant surviving after B days in SA 1/20,000. These results agree also with the time of appearance of papillae on plate cultures and of resistant strains derived from them. III. EXPERIMENTS WITE B. DYSENTERIAE FLEXNER G:ROWN ON ACRIFLAVINE (Table 3) Preliminary experiments showed that Flexner's dysentery bacillus would not grow readily on plates of nutrient agar corltaining acriflavine in higher con- centration than 1/405000. If this bacillus is sown on nutrient agar plates con- taining acriflavine 1/60,000, colonies appear whiGh measure 0*10-0*25 mm. after 24 hr. incubation. After 48 hr. they measure 0 25-0 75 mm. and about</page><page sequence="9">F. H. STEWART 339 one-quarter of them carry minute ill-defined papillae. On the 3rd day the colonies measure 0 25-1 00 mm., and many, but not all, carry yellow pa.pillae, while the bodies of the colonies are colourless. On the 5th day colonies without papillae measure 0*25mm., colonies with papillae 1*00-1*25 mm. The papillae are golden in colour from absorption of acri- flavine while the bodies of colonies remain pale grey. Table 3. If now on the 3rd, 4th or 5th day sub- cultures are made on to drug-free agar or broth (Table 3, column 2), (1) from papillae and (2) from the margin of colonies then growth results in all cases from the papillae, but no growth from the margins (column 3 ) . The bodies of the colonies appear to die before the 3rd day. After 48 hr. growth on the primary plate (Table 3, column 2, line 1) the colonies are too small to allow of papillae being picked off separately, but drug-free suboultures were made from the colonies with papillae (column 3, line 1). If, further, the bacteria from these drug-free sub- cultures (column 3, lines 1, 3, 6 and 10) (derived from the papillae bearing colonies at 48 hr. a,nd from the papillae on the 3rd, 4th and 5th days) are plated on acriflavine 1/60,000, the colonies which appear after 24 hr. fall roughly into two groups (column 4); large measuring 0 50-0 75 mm. and small 0 10-0+20 mm. If these two groups are then suboultured into drug- free broth (column 5), the larger colonies give living suboultures, but from the small colonies no growth results in three cases out of four. Finally, if the descendants of the large colonies are plated on nutrient agar containing acriflavine 1/20,000 and a control strain of the same bacillus which has never been in contact with acriflavine is sown on similar plates, then numerous colonies, measuring 0 05-0 50 mm., appear on the former (Table 3, column 11, lines 1, 3 and 6) descended from papillae and no growth whatever on the latter (line 9). Therefore papillae formed on aJcriflavine 1/60s000 contain ( 1) resistant forms (L) capable of growing on 1/20,000, (2) non-resistant forms (S) which die out even on 1/60,000 (Table 3, columns 4 and 5, lines 2, 4 and 7). If strains established from the largest and the smallest colonies from papillae (column 5, lines 10 and 11) are titrated in broth tubes containing in- creasing concentrations of the drug, the former grow in 1/13,000, while the latter grow in 1/17,000, i.e. both are resistant. The no-contact strains will not grow beyond 1/41,000 (lines 13 and 15). If the descendants of a papilla of the 7th day un- analysed by plating and therefore possibly con- taining a mixture of resistant and non-resistant cells are titrated in a similar series, they can grow in 1/21,000 (line 14). IV. EXPERIMENTS WITH B. DYSENTERIAE FLEXNER, GROWN ON ARGIYROL (Table 4) If Flexner's bacillus is sown on plates of nutrient agar containing argyrol, it will certainly grow when the strength of the drug is 1/120,000 or 1/90,000 but may fail on any higher concentration. Table 4. On agar plates containing argyrol 1/120,000 or 1/90,000 after 24 hr. incubation the colonies measure 1*0-2*5 mm. Papillae appear on the 4th day. They are largely submarginal in posi- tion. If suboultures are made on this day from papillae or from non-papillary areas, growth results in both cases. As the papillae increass in size they become markedly yellow from the drug, while the body of the colony remains pale grey. On the 8th day suboultures on to drug-free media will grow if made from papillae but not if from areas without papillae (Table 6, lines 5 and 6). Secondary papillae may appear on the larger primary papillae on this 8th da,y. If strains from papillae and non-papillary areas of the 4th and 8th da,ys on 1/120,000 and of the 6th and 9th days on 1/90,000 (but non-papillary strains are not available on 8th and 9th days), together with a no-contact control, are titrated either on plates (Table 4, lines 1, 2 and 3) or in broth tubes (lines 6- 13), all these three, papillary, non-papillary and no- contact, will grow up to the same strength of the drug. Therefore no resistant strain has been formed in the papillae. V. EXPERIMENTS WITH B. DYSENTERIAE FLEXNER ON NEOSALVARSAN (Table 5) Flexner's bacillus of a no-contact strain will grow on plates containing neosalvarsan up to at least 1/11,500 (Table 5, line 1). Titrated in broth tubes, papillary, marginal and no-contact strains grow to the same titre (lines 2-4 and 5-7). Therefore no resistant variant is formed in the papillae. VI. THE BIOLOGUICAL FUNCTIONS OF PAPILLAE (Table 6) Table 6 shows the results of suboulture on successive days from agar plates (both with and without drugs) into tubes of drug-free broth. The suboultures were made in pairs (A) from papillae and (B) from non- papillary areas, of the same or of adjacent colonies. The purpose was to ascertain whether the bacteria in one of these two situations outlived those in the other. It will be seen in Table 6 that in all cases the papillae gave lisring suboultures after the non- papillary areas had ceased to do so.

Agar wiffi acrt345avirwe. Non-papillary bacteria die very early? viz. on the 3rd or 4th day while papillary bacteriaw are alive orl the 6th (and later) The sur+rivaT of the papillae is therefore due to adaptive varia.tion aoting before the 4th day and possibly to rejuvena- tion from the 5th or 6th.* We note that papillae are most numerous on plates which form no variants (Table 6 lines 1, 3, 5 and 7&gt; p. 341). This may probably be explained as follows that rejuvenation is a lass powerful response than adap- tive variation and thereire more centres of re- juvenat,ion are needed to produee survival by the weaker means than by the stronger, i.e. adaptive varlatlon. The colonies marked PP or PPP in lines 1, 3 5 and 7 are very striking objects, being covered with papillae which may measure up to 0 3 mm. in diameter. The distribution of these papillae is con- stantly t,he same; they appear :first on isolated colonies around the outskirts of growth on a plate, * It is a very tempting suppOsitioIl that the S colonies in Table 1, col. 4, lines 11, 13, 17 anc3 Table 3 col. 4, lines 2 4, 7 which appear on drug-containin$ plates after kng previous contact with the drug (SA or acriflavine), but are so weakened that they cannot grow when suboultured into drug-free broth, are strains which have survived in papillae by rejuvenation with- out variation. and on eaeh individual eolony they appear near the margin in that half of the eolony which is turned to the unoeeupied part of the plate and away from the eentral acewnulation of eolonies. At their full de- velopment at least 50 °/0 o:f a11 eolonies earry 1arge rlumbers of papillae, suffieient in many instances to cover the whole surSee of the eolonyv Some older papillae bear younger (granddaughter) papillae oil their surfaee. It is intieresting to eompare this distribution with the distribution on eolonies of B. colt-rnutabtle on lactose plates. As Massini pointed out; the red papillae appear near the centre of the colonies and are never seen at the margir. This remarkable efflorescenee of papillae on plates devoid of adaptive variation tnay be interpreted as an answer to the call for rejuvenation by sensscent cultures which have no other means of sllrvival. The first and most profuse appearance of papillae at the vutskirts of growth on a plate, where bod is most available and waste products least concen- trated, may correspond with the observation that conjugation in Paramoecxvtn or Sptrogyra is most active at the time of highest vitality and before the downward trerld of the liX cycle begins. Some writers have asserted that papilIae aIways contam favoured variants of some kind and that the papilla is merely a suceessful daughter colony con- sisting of an improved raee. They deny that it has arly power to preserve the race in adverse conditions apart from these hypothetical vanationsa or that its consti-tuent bacteria are in any way analogous func- tionally with the zygotes of Pcl,ramoecivrB or Sptro- gyra. Against this +7iew may be brought the obser- v&amp;tion that pa?illae often Inake their appearance as xninute objects 0et:35-0*10 mm. in diameter and never grow any largerS wGhich is not the size to be expected in a successful dallghter colorly. We should also note that only two or three favourable variations have been found to occur on neutral media (i.e. agar without drugs or sugars) in arlystrain of bacteria, while the number of successive generations of suboulture £rom sueeessive papillae ean be very great indeed before the strain begins to degerwerate zn vitro. It is therefore not possible that these numerous papillae ean originats in these few variations, sinee a variation having onee oeeurred eannot be rapeated in the same strain. BaGteriaW whieh have aehieved an adaptive variation, such as the red raee of B. c01s-7nutabtte, eontinue to form papillae eithex on plain or on lactose agar. It is certainly true that some change takes plaee in the baeteria of a11 papillae, sinee they survive after the rest; of ihe eolony is dead, but this ehange is &amp;nalogous to that whieh takes plaee after conjuga- tion in Ps6rarnoeci?hm or Spsrogyr; in other words the ehange is that of rejurrenation (exeept in those few cases in which adaptive variation also takes place).</page><page sequence="13">F. H. STEWART 343 This change of rejuvena.tion is not permanent and irreversible as is adaptive variation, and therefore conjugation or papilla. formation does not give perpetual youth, and senility follows again in due course. It will clarify our ideas if we form a hypothesis about the cytology of these changes, and it may be stated in the following terms. In both rejuvenation and adaptive variation the papillary bacteria carry out an autogamic shuffling of chromatic matter. In adaptive variation this shuffling results in a. per- manent change in the genetic composition, while in rejuvenation. it does not result in this way. SUMMARY Bactllus dysentertc6e Flexner (Shigella paradysentrtae) grown on Lemco agar plates (without peptone) con- taining sulphanilamide 1/20,000 to 1/10,000 forms papillae which on suboulture yield two strains: (1) the original strain unmodified and (2) a. strain resistant to SA. The latter has arisen by discontinuous variation. There are no forms intermediate between strain ( 1 ) and strain (2). In one such case (Exp. 1, p. 334) the no-contact ra.ee, the vmmodified non-resistant strain from the primary sulphanilamide plate and the resisting variant strain were titrated in broth containing vsulphanilamide in ten increasing concentra.tions from 1/34,000 to 1/5000. The first two strains, the no-contact and the unmodified non-resistant from the sulphanilamide plate grew in SA 1/34,000 and failed in 1/21,000, while the resisting variant grew up to the tube containing SA 1/6000 a.nd failed to grow in 1/5000. On pla.tes containing sulphanilamide this adaptive variation ta.kes place only in the papillae. It can also take place in broth containing, for example, SA 1/20,000 to 1/10,000. There is no such thing as gradual progressive acquisition of resistance by the whole of a bacterial population exposed to a drug. Such phrases as ' teaching bacteria to resist ' are misleading aRnd anthropomorphic and should not be employed. Fluid cultures which show a progressive gradual increase of resistance do so as a result of an increasing percentage of resistant cells in a mixed population of resistant and non-resistant bacteria. Experiments in fluid media should always be checked and the growth analysed by plating. Resistant strains maintain this character after prolonged growth on drug-free media. (2) Flexner's dysentery bacillus grown on plates containing acriflavine 1/60,000 to 1/40,000 forms in papillae strains resistant to this drug. The non- papillary areas of colonies die early, viz. on the 3rd day. The variation in this case also is discontinuous. (3) On the other hand, if Flexner's bacillus is grown on agar containing organic compounds of silver or arsenic (argyrol or neosalv3rsan), it forms no variants resisting these drugs. (4) Papillae possess two biological functions: (a) they are the site of adaptive variation in response to elements in their environment, such as harmful drugs or useful sugars; (b) they are also the site of rejuvena,tion of senile cells arld of cells affected by common unfavourable conditions such as exhaustion of food supply and accummulation of exeretory sub- stances. The greatest development of papillae takes place on plates which form no variants, such as plates of drug-free agar, agar plates containing sulph-anil- amide sown with strains resistant to sulphanilamide and plates containing organic compounds of silver or arsenic.</page><page sequence="14">344 Experiments on adaptive variation abnd reJuvenation REFERENCES I.
