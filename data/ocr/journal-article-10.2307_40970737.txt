<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Separate Spheres / to Dangerous Streets: / Postmodernist / Feminism and the / Problem / Â£ r'rf'nr* / BY ELIZABETH OT VjlOSr / FOX-GENOVESE With mounting urgency and ill-disguised impatience, feminist theory has, during the past few decades, mounted a massive, if internally divided, attack upon received notions of order in society, culture, and ideology. At the core of the attack lies an angry protest against distributions of power that have traditionally favored men at the expense of women. From the outraged insistence that rape and sexual harass- ment may not be tolerated as unfortunate by-products of business-as-usual, to the complexities of postmodernist theo- ries that reject the very notion of difference as inherently oppressive, women's rage at their own disadvantage has provoked many challenges to all inherited conceptions of order as inherently androcentric. As the feminist challenge to received notions of order has unfolded, it has become clear that the unitary term feminism itself masks the diversity of feminisms. If, as Carol Gilligan has claimed, women speak "in a different voice," they, much less the feminists who claim to speak for them, assuredly do not SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 60, No. 2 (Summer 1993)</page><page sequence="2">236 SOCIAL RESEARCH speak in one voice.1 In this climate, the meaning of feminism has become contested. Depending upon temperament, social allegiance, philosophical bent, and political goals, feminists variously defend the fundamental difference or the essential similarity between women and men. Some adhere to the unrealized promises of liberal feminism; some seek a common ground between feminism and postmodernism. Some focus primarily upon what they take to be the common goals of all women; some focus upon the distinct needs of women of oppressed social, racial, and national groups. And since any of these positions may intertwine with or prove at variance with any other, the difficulties of identifying a single feminist position multiply. Presumably the core of any feminism today, as in the past, lies in the commitment to improving the position of women. But this minimal agreement ends where it begins. For feminists, much less women in general, do not agree on the meaning of improvement. At the most basic level, should feminists seek to strengthen women within families and marriages or to free women from them- to protect women's reproductive capacities or to free women from their conse- quences? Having originated with Mary Wollstonecraft's call for the public recognition of the rights of woman and developed through struggles to secure public political rights, notably the vote, for women, feminism has, in our time, come increasingly to doubt the value of public rights and to repudiate the distinction between public and private that apparently secured women's persisting inequality. Public and Private For many feminists, as Seyla Benhabib and Drucilla Cornell argue, the distinction between an impersonal public and a 1 Carol Gilligan, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1982).</page><page sequence="3">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 237 personal private sphere, with the attendant distinction between public and private interests, has been "constitutive not only of the institutional structure of modern, Western societies but [has] shaped the dominant conception of reason and rational- ity in them as well."2 Although some feminists, notably Jean Bethke Elshtain, view the split between public and private as necessary to the health of society and beneficial to women and children, a majority are coming to view it as inherently opposed to women's interests- as the primary locus and source of their oppression.3 In this view, the distinction between public and private represents an arbitrary and imposed conception of order that has systematically disadvantaged women. Both the recognition of the distinction between public and private as a comprehensive order and the determination to wage a frontal attack against it have emerged piecemeal from a variety of subsidiary critiques of male dominance. Even today, not all of those who call themselves feminists view the distinction as the main object of attack. But when all the caveats have been filed, it seems clear that the metaphor of the distinction between public and private has provided a significant group of feminist theorists with a unifying theory of male dominance that links private experience to political institutions and, especially, to philosophy and epistemology. Not surprisingly, the feminist attack upon the notion of order as grounded in the distinction between public and private has been most vigorous among academics, especially those who have been seeking some common ground between feminism and postmodernism. It is worth noting, in passing, that the distinction between 2 Seyla Benhabib and Drucilla Cornell, "Introduction," in Seyla Benhabib and Drucilla Cornell, eds., Feminism as Critique (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), p. 7. 3 Jean Bethke Elshtain, Public Man, Private Woman: Women in Social and Political Thought (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="4">238 SOCIAL RESEARCH public and private that has come in for such heavy attack arose in conjunction with capitalism. Most societies have delineated some boundary between public and private, but capitalist societies raised the distinction to a new importance, primarily because their emphasis upon systematic individualism as the governing principle of the public sphere included a decisive split between the principles that dominated public and private life respectively.4 Schematically, public life in democratic societies grounded in the free market was taken to operate according to contractual principles, whereas private life was taken to operate according to consensual ones. This is Tonnies's distinction between Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft- between society and community. Such societies- especially the United States, in which democratic principles reached their most extensive sway- tended to equate the distinction between public and private with the distinction between male and female, assigning a congeries of human attributes to each. They especially tended to associate public men with the harsh virtues of competition, struggle, and justice, while associating private women with the gentler virtues of compassion, piety, and selfless service. As a result, and at the risk of crude oversimplification, they tended to attribute production and politics to men, while attributing reproduction and morality to women. The metaphor of public and private thus merged with the metaphor of a sexual division of labor, encouraging the view that it derived from nature. The comprehensiveness of the metaphor endowed it with the prestige of a natural order and thus ensured its hegemony, which in turn ensured that the metaphor would outlive the world it had been devised to explain. For the progress of 4 For a discussion of systematic individualism, see my Feminism Without Illusions: A Critique of Individualism (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1991). I am using individualism in a specific sense as the theory that ascribes sovereignty and cognition to the individual, understood as an autonomous unit.</page><page sequence="5">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 239 capitalism has been steadily eroding the distinction between public and private in social, economic, and political life. Indeed, the post-World War II women's movement arose largely as a response to that erosion. Similarly, dominant currents in (male) thought have long been whittling away at any complacent, unquestioning acceptance of rationality and reason. Whatever Sigmund Freud's sins against women's self-perceptions, he assuredly exposed the prevalence of irrational forces that press against the bulwarks of complacent rationality. Yet even as events and theorists exposed the permeability of the boundary between the public and private spheres, some core of the metaphor of their distinction persisted. The Idea of Difference Today, that abiding core, notably its emphasis upon the significance of difference, has emerged as the anchor for an entire system of order and as the principal object of some feminists' attack. Although specific arguments vary, they frequently find common ground in the notion that the idea of difference itself disadvantages women. By this reasoning, dominant male thought has systematically cast woman as the other, attributing to her the opposite qualities from those that men claim for themselves. In this perspective, rationality, reason, and justice- the preeminent attributes of the public sphere- appear hopelessly compromised by their association with men. As distinctly male qualities, they vitiate their own claims to universality and shrink to the self-interested attempt of one group to impose its will on another. At issue, it appears, is the very notion of order itself. Order in this sense has been exposed as serving the interests of some at the expense of the interests of others. In fairness, the idea that the defense of order tends to advantage the privileged against the dispossessed is hardly new. Class</page><page sequence="6">240 SOCIAL RESEARCH struggles, throughout history, have frequently rested upon precisely that claim, as the French, Haitian, and Russian revolutions abundantly attest. This time, however, the goal is less to substitute one notion of order for another than it is to contest the notion of order itself. By identifying the metaphor of the distinction between public and private with men's advantage over women, feminist theorists have effectively argued that the notion of order must be recognized as the determination to substitute one person's (or group's) story for that of another person or group. Men have succeeded in subsuming women's perceptions under their own with the pernicious consequence that women can see- and represent- themselves only through men's eyes. The battle against the order of public and private is being waged on many levels simultaneously, with somewhat different implications in different cases. But the combination of specific assaults amounts to a systematic war upon the very notion of legitimate authority. In the meaure that feminists are contributing to this general antiauthoritarian project, the most serious consequence may well be that in attempting to demolish the legitimacy of authority that has customarily been wielded by men, feminists have mistaken the enemy and are easing the triumph of new and more sinister forms of authority. In this respect, the attacks on various levels do converge, if only by calling the notion of order into question. But along the way, the discrete battles merit discrete attention. It is easy enough to understand the feminist claim that the notion of difference has, more often than not, disadvantaged women by casting them as the other. It is less clear that women have always resented the qualities that have been attributed to them. There is good evidence that nineteenth-century Ameri- can women frequently took pride in their association with morality and even attempted to introduce their distinct moral values into the public sphere. Thus Harriet Beecher Stowe's widely influential novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, unambiguously</page><page sequence="7">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 241 pressed domestic virtues as. a standard for the nation.5 Similarly, women reformers of the Progressive Era introduced notions of social housekeeping, notably responsibility for the weak and the disadvantaged, into the public sphere and, increasingly, into the activities of the government itself. Even today, some feminists, like Sara Ruddick, insist that women's experience has uniquely fitted them for such public responsi- bilities as preserving peace, while others, like Carol Gilligan, credit women with a special, and valuable, sense of morality.6 The conviction that women embody and represent a discrete sense of morality and, implicitly, favor an alternate political agenda retains considerable appeal for large numbers of women. The recent enthusiasm, on the part of some men as well as women, for the election of women to national political office apparently owes much to many people's conviction that, for whatever reasons, women would do things differently. As one working woman said to me, one good thing that was going to change was that we were now beginning to elect more women to office. She did not remember when things had been in such bad shape, but women were not going into politics for "that power thing" and, accordingly, might make a difference.7 The intuitive sense that women were not driven by "that power thing" and might change the quality of political life testifies to the conviction that women represent a different, and more humane, conception of order than men. Women, this view assumes, will be more likely to attend to the needs of the vulnerable, more likely to value peace, and less likely to follow the dictates of greed and ego. Carol Tavris has relentlessly exposed the pitfalls of this position, arguing that both fixed notions of gender or sexual difference and the 5 Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin or, Life Among the Lowly, ed.

And if she repeatedly signals the ways in which these notions limit and impoverish men, she yet more scathingly attacks the ways in which they imprison women in debilitating stereotypes. She especially insists that "the philos- ophy of cultural feminism has functioned to keep women focused on their allegedly stable and innate personality qualities, instead of on what it would take to have a society based on the qualities we value in both sexes."8 In Tavris's view, the female stereotypes celebrated by women are no better than those imposed by men. But, she insists, we cannot effectively combat the stereotypes if we persist in the trend toward increased particularization "in which each gender, race, or ethnicity seeks only its own validation, celebrates only itself." For Tavris, the future health of our society depends upon our ability to resist the temptation to think in terms of opposites- to cast entire groups as "the other"- and to learn to think about an inclusive "us, so that our relationships, our work, our children, and our planet will flourish."9 Tavris astutely grasps the implicit relation between the notion of women as other that derived from the split between public and private and the notion of difference that plays such an important role in contemporary cultural politics, including within feminism itself. We cannot, she seems to be arguing, solve the problem of casting women as essentially different (from men) simply by multiplying differences. In this respect, she is, however cautiously, edging toward the postmodern position that any notion of difference is inherently authoritar- ian and constraining. As a psychologist, Tavris is primarily concerned not to limit the diversity of human potential by 8 Carol Tavris, The Mismeasure of Woman (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992), p. 343. 9 Ibid., pp. 341,345.</page><page sequence="9">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 243 restricting human beings to artificially defined roles, notably but not exclusively gender roles. Tavris especially seeks to demonstrate that the purported physiological differences between women and men, notably in their brains, result from faulty research that predicated man as the norm and attempted to identify women's deviation from the norm. She argues that "nature" does not provide adequate evidence for the classifications, or "culture," that human beings have imposed upon it. Postmodernist feminists, like Susan Hekman, more uncompromisingly insist that the very categories of nature and culture embody artificial, binary oppositions that result exclusively from the determination of some human beings to dominate others.10 In this view, gender difference emerges as one among the many manifestations of the dichotomous thinking that has characterized modernism. Moderns and Postmoderns The postmodernist critique of modernism, upon which postmodernist feminists are increasingly drawing, faults modernism for having cognitively and epistemologically divided the world into dichotomous or binary pairs. For the moderns, a loose group that is normally taken to include all of the thinkers from Hobbes to Hegel and Marx who attempted to articulate the world spawned by capitalism and the scientific revolution, order derived from the clear split between paired entities or qualities: nature/culture, rationality/irrationality, subject/object, and, of course, male/female. This sense of order, which emphasized the autonomy and moral responsibil- ity of the individual- the rational subject- effectively divided the cognitive and material worlds into pairs of A and B. Postmodernists, drawing variously on currents in science, 10 Susan J. Hekman, Gender and Knowledge: Elements of a Postmodern Feminism (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1990).</page><page sequence="10">244 SOCIAL RESEARCH psychology, culture, and politics, have worked to explode those binary oppositions, arguing that the lines that divide them are blurred, not clear, and must, accordingly, be recognized as figments of the human imagination or, worse, of human convenience. For them, under the special influence of Michel Foucault, the world consists in nothing but a system of discourses or patterns of naming that are driven by a ubiquitous will to power.11 Although Foucault had little to say about, and probably less interest in, the special situation of women, he unilaterally declared war on the notion that sexuality did or should derive from some putative nature. Sexuality should be understood as plastic- as the manifesta- tion of human desire whose only master was the infinitely variable human imagination. Drawing upon the general critique of dichotomous thinking, postmodernist feminists have increasingly insisted that the binary opposition between male and female informs and anchors all the other binary oppositions. In their view, modernist dichotomies are all inherently and inescapably gendered. In joining forces with the postmodernist revolt against modernist order, they have tended to identify the sexual domination of women by men as the core- the motive force- of the modernist exercise of power. From this perspective, the distinction between A and B reduces to nothing but a transparent disguise for the self-serving distinction between A and Not-A. Thus the distinction between man and woman inescapably casts woman as not-man, leaving women's purportedly admirable characteristics and attributes as nothing but the lack of maleness. Although postmodernist feminists occasionally find it hard 11 Michel Foucault developed these theories in a series of widely read and influential books, culminating in his The History of Sexuality (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), vol. 1 : An Introduction, tr. Robert Hurley.

For if the difference between women and men may be exposed as an artifact of language and domination, on what grounds may we assume that women have any interests distinct from those of men? In this respect, feminism, rather than embodying an alternative conception of order, merges with a generalized assault on order understood as nothing more than the mask of illegitimate authority. Thus, in another connec- tion, it has been noticed that in the work of the Critical Legal Studies school- another and formidable radical challenge to prevailing notions of order- "illegitimate authority" comes under constant attack without a hint of what the Radical Critics would accept as legitimate authority.12 Postmodernist feminists' determination to expose all of modernist thought and practice as a conspiracy of male dominance contributes decisively to the prevailing notion that no authority can be divorced from the self-serving exercise of power. For, although their position derives from the assump- tion that men have dominated women, it develops on the assumption that the distinction between women and men is itself a manifestation of that (illegitimate) power and, consequently, ends in some part-Hobbesian, part-Nietzschean view of power as the ceaseless striving of the individual will. By thus insisting upon the essential gendering of all modernist thought, postmodernist feminists equate the revolt against illegitimate authority with a revolt against all forms of order. The tendency to elide the specific power relations of modernism with relations of power in general may emerge even more sharply from feminist postmodernism than from postmodernism in general. History confirms that the sharp 12 Eugene D. Genovese, "Critical Legal Studies as Radical Politics and Ideology," Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities 3 (Winter 1991): 131-155.</page><page sequence="12">246 SOCIAL RESEARCH opposition between, say, nature and culture, or rationality and irrationality, is especially characteristic of modernism. Al- though a variety of premodern societies have tentatively drawn similar distinctions, they have all been more likely than Western capitalist societies to live comfortably with a blurring of the boundaries, as, for example, in the acceptance of magic or the active intervention of supernatural presences in human affairs. But the distinction between male and female has a more consistent historical pedigree, extending throughout most (if not all) of history and across most (if not all) cultures. In this respect, to anchor the attack upon binary distinctions in the distinctions between male and female is, necessarily, to extend the attack upon modernism to an attack upon order in general and, portentously, to an attack upon the entire human past. Ironically, rather than offer an alternative to modernism, postmodernism, with its extraordinary emphasis on personal expression, in effect drives the logic of modernist individual- ism to its ultimate conclusion, in which a flagrant nihilism passes into a transparent totalitarianism. For, in the measure that the attack upon order is waged in the name of subjective perception and unlimited self-determination, it is also an attack upon the notion of any legitimate patterning or control in human relations. Yet it has gone unnoticed that the firmest, most internally consistent theory of "the personal is political"- and vice versa- emerged from the work of Giovanni Gentile, the premier philosopher of Italian fascism, who had the wit to know that he was proclaiming a totalitarian doctrine.13 No less significantly, the postmodernist feminist attack upon the order embodied in the split between public and private effectively elides modern and premodern patterns of gender relations, thus ignoring the important differences between them. Modern- i.e., individualist or bourgeois- gender rela- 13 See, e.g., Giovanni Gentile, The Genesis and Structure of Society, tr. H. S. Harris (Urbana: Illinois University Press, 1960).</page><page sequence="13">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 247 tions drew heavily upon historical precedents, but decisively reworked them.14 Feminist theorists, notably Carole Pateman and Moira Gatens, have argued that modernist social and political theories have incorporated unequal gender relations into their essence.15 In Pateman's view, the myth of the social contract depended upon a complementary myth of the marriage contract, and both predicated the individual or subject of the contract as male. In Gatens's view, modernist political philosophy invariably assumed a male perspective. No doubt, Pateman and Gatens make important points: Modern societies have granted men decisive advantages within marriage and in intellectual life, and the men so advantaged have tended to fuse their personal perspectives to their claims about natural order and universal truth. The question nonetheless remains whether their pretensions in this regard decisively compromised the ideas and institutions they were promoting and, beyond that, whether it serves the complexities of our current political and intellectual situation to legitimate those pretensions by establishing them as the proper object of our attack. Theory and Interest Assume, for purposes of argument, that the men who expounded the theory of systematic or possessive individual- ism drew heavily upon their own experience and aspirations.16 Does it necessarily follow that the theory can be understood 14 Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Eugene D. Genovese, Fruits of Merchant Capital: Slavery and Bourgeois Property in the Rise and Expansion of Capitalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983). 15 Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1988); Moira Gatens, Feminism and Philosophy: Perspectives on Difference and Equality (Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 1991). 1D The designation possessive individualism is that of C.

Or, to put it differently, must we agree that no theory can reach beyond the immediate interests of its creator? In theoretical terms, the theorists of individualism explicitly imagined the individual as an imper- sonal entity- a unit of sovereignty and cognition. In the measure that their primary objectives were political, they sought a theory that would justify the representation and protect the integrity of absolute private property. They normally assumed that property-owners would be men, but they did not tie their theory to that assumption, not least because the mainspring of their revolt against previous forms of authority lay in a repudiation of the personalism and anthropomorphism of patriarchal theory.17 To protect against the recurrence of personalism, they fashioned the political subject or individual as a category to which very different kinds of people might lay claim. No, in time and place, they did not expect women to do so, although Thomas Hobbes would admit no natural or logical barrier to their doing so. Nor, in time and place, did they expect propertyless men or black slaves to do so. But their failures of imagination did not inherently compromise the theory to which countless people whom, in practice, it initially excluded have subsequently laid claim. Their determination that government represent property helps to account for their rapid embrace of the split between public and private spheres as the premier metaphor of order. For in constructing a model of the polity that primarily reflected the clash of interests- a polity that mirrored the free play of the capitalist market- they banished, as the wisest of them knew, the moral obligations and responsibilities that bind unequal human beings into some semblance of a community. In so doing, they effected a figurative divorce between power 17 For an elaboration, see Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, "Property and Patriarchy in Early Bourgeois Political Culture," Radical History Review 4 (Spring/Summer 1977): 36-59.</page><page sequence="15">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 249 and morality, ascribing power to the public sphere and morality to the private. Older images of responsible power, such as the obligations of absolute monarchs to their humblest subjects, thereby evaporated, leaving women, as denizens of the private sphere, to pick up the slack. At its most sinister, the model of order grounded in the split between public and private spheres apparently pro- claimed that morality, service, and responsibility had nothing to do with the exercise of power. At its most generous, it proclaimed a complementarity and interdependence between public and private spheres. In both guises, however, it tended to obscure or mystify the relations between the economy and the polity. As, during the twentieth century, private property became progressively less adequate to support even middle-class families and as women in growing numbers entered the labor force, the advantages of men over women became increasingly visible and less justifiable. And the strength of the historical legacy of male privilege in the public sphere diluted- or even made mockery of- the belated advantage to women of gaining access to the "rights" that men had customarily enjoyed. No, the vote did not equalize the earning power of women and men. Even access to the professional training and prestigious occupations did not equalize the earning power of women and men, although in isolated cases it might. Under these conditions, some women's growing resentment of male prerogatives and power appeared nothing if not natural. And as the acquisition of public rights failed dramatically to improve women's comparative situation, feminists first insisted that the true root of women's oppression lay in the private sphere and then that its root lay in the distinction between the public and the private sphere. But this feminist course into postmodernism tended increasingly to ignore the relations between politics and political economy and to focus on the destruction of an allegedly oppressive order at the expense of projecting a new model of legitimate authority.</page><page sequence="16">250 SOCIAL RESEARCH The Attack on Difference Let us return to the attack on difference. The idea that women, for whatever reasons, normally represent different values from those of men does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that any notion of difference is inherently invidious. Significantly, the argument that the notion of difference subjugates or devalues women is, more often than not, advanced by women who perceive themselves as in direct competition with men- typically professionals and intellectu- als. Or, to put it differently, postmodernism looks very different in the seminar room than it does on the streets. For there can be no doubt that postmodernity is upon us with a vengeance. The problem for academics and policy-makers remains to make sense of its implications. The most visible feminist positions, notwithstanding their persisting differences, have been disproportionately driven by the concerns of single, white, affluent, and well-educated women.18 There can be no doubt that these elite women have discrete (and legitimate) concerns about their own position, as women and increasingly as individuals, within the elite, which they have every right to defend. But their concerns are not necessarily those of poor women of different racial and national backgrounds. To women of the elite, the split between public and private may frequently appear an illegitimate barrier to their freedom as individuals. But for less privileged women that split, which has been disintegrating in their communities, may appear as the last best hope for survival. More often than not, poor women's survival depends upon the possibility of some minimal cooperation with the men of their group. Thus, while elite women may well experience single motherhood as freedom from male domination, 18 This assertion is based on extensive study of public-opinion polls from the late 1960s to the early 1990s and will be elaborated in What Do We Want for Our Daughters (And Our Sons)?</page><page sequence="17">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 251 disadvantaged women are more likely to experience it as the price of not holding men accountable or of not permitting men to assume their responsibilities as fathers. And while elite women may revel in the availability of pornography as a means of exploring and expanding their own identities, disadvan- taged women are more likely to experience it as the dangers proliferating in the streets in which they raise their children. Even such committed postmodernist feminists as Susan Hekman acknowledge some difficulty in accommodating postmodernist theory to practical politics. But, she argues, our "present situation is one in which, in the absence of a transcendent metanarrative, different discourses compete for ascendancy"- a situation that "necessitates a different ap- proach to politics." Given the impossibility of an appeal to "the legitimating norms of a metanarrative," political opposition must rely upon a "different conception of knowledge that generates a different means of opposition to the subjugation imposed by the discourses that structure societal relations."19 In the end, Hekman offers only new forms of opposition to the discourse of the feminine that men have devised. But, at the risk of firing cheap shots, I cannot fathom how she expects those forms of opposition to improve the immediate situation of the countless number of un- and underemployed women whom our postmodern economy is tossing into the dustbin of multigenerational poverty and destitution. Any theory confronts the difficult challenge of its practical application and possible social benefits for those who did not devise it. It has become a commonplace that many of the apparently most open and generous aspects of the theory of individualism- equal opportunity, career open to talent, freedom of contract- could as easily lead to the oppression as the advancement of working people. We know that capitalism embraced the language of democracy and freedom at least in 19 Hekman, Gender and Knowledge, p. 187.</page><page sequence="18">252 SOCIAL RESEARCH part to secure its own freedom to wring profits from the dispossessed. We know that even as the Fourteenth Amend- ment to the Constitution secured the right of former slaves to the free disposition of the ownership of their persons, it secured the same right to corporations as "legal persons." Most Americans, including working people who are generally more astute about the real conditions of their lives than the intellectuals who speak in their name, have not rejected those theories, primarily because, on balance, they have believed that the promise outweighed the deceptions and abuses. Identifying the Enemy Feminism has posed a new and impressive challenge to the vision of order grounded in the split between public and private spheres, but the mainspring of that challenge derives from the revolutionary changes in women's lives that have resulted from revolutionary changes in our economy. The unprecedented entry of women into the labor force, accompa- nied by unprecedented changes in patterns of reproduction, has graphically represented the erosion of the boundaries between public and private spheres attendant upon the virtual collapse of private property and the emergence of women as primary individuals. The consequences include a growing tendency to divorce sex from morality, sex from reproduction, and, more portentously, reproduction from morality.20 These are indeed the symptoms of the postmodern world that is upon us. The problems with postmodernist feminism as a response to our condition do not arise from the plausibility of its descriptions of accelerating fragmentation and atomization of 20 See Richard Posner, Sex and Reason (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992) and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, "Beyond Transgression: Toward a Free Market in Morals," Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities (1993).</page><page sequence="19">POSTMODERNIST FEMINISM 253 previous conceptions of order. The problems arise from its ability to identify the enemy and, especially, from its naive confidence that a frontal attack on modernism's vision of order and authority could result in the beneficent liberation of human potential in all its diversity. It is mesmerizing to note that the postmodernist feminist attack on the order embodied in the split between public and private spheres invariably emphasizes the element of mystification that permitted that order to disguise its own ambitions to domination and even coercion. Time and again, we read that the great sin in dichotomous thinking or in the split between public and private lay in its sinister ability to appear "natural" and hence to mask its own imposition of power. But why should we assume that a hegemony's proclivity for mystification- the disguise of its own character and inten- tions-adheres only to modernism? Would it not be truer to the spirit of critical skepticism- would it not make more sense- to assume that mystification accompanies any hege- mony, whatever specific form it may take, and that a hegemony of some kind is necessary and proper? If we agree that the order of modernism simultaneously articulated and served the development of capitalism, should we not try to identify the economic forces propelling the postmodernist surge? Is anyone so blind as not to recognize those economic forces precisely in the international conglomerates that are propelling the revolution in technology as well as tolerating, when not financing, the destruction of family, church, and every other institution that aspires to a measure of autonomy? The greatest failure of postmodernist theorists and critics is to assume that we are immune to the patterns and relations that we detect in others. Thus my own candidate for the primary beneficiary of postmodernism triumphant is the new global economic order, notably the multinational corporations, the largest twenty-five of which have annual products that exceed the GNPs of the United States and Western Europe combined. Postmodernist</page><page sequence="20">254 SOCIAL RESEARCH feminists apparently refuse to see that by conflating male dominance with the split between public and private and targeting both as the enemy, they are missing the obvious- that their misplaced attack constitutes the cutting edge of the economic juggernaut they naively think they are opposing. Here, we dare not fall into the trap of economic determinism. The attack on all order because it is necessarily hierarchical and the charge that authority, because hierarchical, is intrinsically illegitimate are leading to social disintegration and impotent rage. But we are not doomed to enact the postmodernist scenario that is already beginning to play itself out in our inner cities. The struggle for a decent alternative can be waged and won- but only by those who unflinchingly reject the siren calls of a radical and deracinated opposition to the very conception of order. * I would like to thank the members of my seminar in feminist theory who so thoughtfully explored these questions with me: Lili Baxter, Lisa Brevard, Laura Cowley, Susan Duncan, Jacqueline HÃ¶ller.
