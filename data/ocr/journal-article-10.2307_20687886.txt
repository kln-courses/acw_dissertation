<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CINEMATIC NARRATOR: THE LOGIC AND PRAGMATICS OF IMPERSONAL NARRATION ROBERT BURGOYNE Narrative analysis focuses on the interac tion of the various strata of the narrative work. It distinguishes such elements as story outline and plot structure, the roles played by the characters or actors, the way narrative information is channelled through point of view, and the relationship of the narrative discourse to the inhabi tants and events of the fictional world. Through the interaction of these different levels, the basic material of the fabula? the ''pattern or relationships between characters and the pattern of actions as they unfoldinchronologicalorder ' ' (Shklov sky in Eagle 17)?may be complicated and expanded, imbued with competing per spectives and articulated through a com plex layering of disparate voices. Each of these levels conveys certain messages about the story-world. As an analytic technique, narrative analysis is uniquely geared to registering the diverse voices and competing symbolic messages gener ated by the text, for by dividing the text into diiferent strata, the various messages produced at each level can be described with precision. In film studies, the practice of narrative analysis has been placed on a sound the oretical footing with the recent publication of several rigorous studies. David Bord welPs Narration in Film, for example, utilizes models developed in Russian For Robert Burgoyne is an associate professor of English and film at Wayne State University. He is the author of Bertolucci's 1900: A Narrrative and Historical Analysis, forthcoming from Wayne State University Press. Copyright ? 1990 by R. Burgoyne malism and literary narratology, primarily the writings of Yuri Tynianov and G?rard Genette, to provide film studies with an alternative to the enunciation theories which dominated the analysis of film nar rative in the seventies. Edward Branigan has also employed literary models, mainly the work of Ann Banfield and S.Y. Kuroda, to establish the theoretical prin ciples of his work on narration and point of view. Approaching the problem from a different perspective, Seymour Chatman has incorporated communication theory and the work of Genette and Wayne Booth to fashion an argument that diverges from Bordwell and Branigan in important ways, a divergence which has already produced a vigorous and useful debate. And a recent study of voice-over narration by Sarah Kozlofif also utilizes the work of Genette and the speech-act theory of Mary Louise Pratt to examine the intricate and complex relationships formed between overt in stances of oral narration and the overall system of narrative discourse in film. These major studies have the merit of situating film narrative theory squarely within the larger currents of narratology as it has developed in literary studies in the last 15 years. In addition to the works above, articles by Francesco Casetti, Andr? Gaudreault, and Brian Henderson, as well as special issues of Wide Angle and Iris on narrative, have sought not only to ground the narrative theory of film in an established theoretical discourse but also to register the unique challenges that film poses to narratology. Despite this range of activity, however, certain basic theoretical issues have yet to JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 3</page><page sequence="2">be resolved. One of the most daunting problems for film narrative theory centers on the status of the cinematic narrator, understood as the illocutionary source or instance of emission of the narrative dis course. Because film is a visual rather than a verbal medium, and does not imply a literal speaker or hearer, some theorists argue that the need to designate a narrato rial source for the representation of the fictional world is obviated: the events of the fictional world simply "tell them selves," in the words of Emile Ben veniste. Other theorists maintain that be cause film communicates messages to a viewer, filmic discourse involves a sender, or addresser, and a receiver, or addressee, in a communicative situation. These two different positions on the cinematic narra tor are not merely a matter of theoretical debate: they have distinct pragmatic and interpretive consequences as well. The issue of the cinematic narrator is espe cially significant in the reading of films which involve narratorial unreliability, ambiguity, and irony?the type of films which are the most appropriate subjects for narrative analysis. In the pages that follow, I will first sum marize some of the most important argu ments concerning this area of debate, and then offer a new approach which defends the concept of the cinematic narrator as a logical and pragmatic necessity. Based on developments in literary narratology, this approach, which Marie-Laure Ryan has called "impersonal narration," will be compared with existing theories of the cinematic narrator in the hope of resolving difficulties that have already produced sharp disagreements in the emergent field of film narrative theory. The significance of identifying the source of the narrative discourse is a debate that film inherits from the narrative analysis of literature, where the necessity of a con cept of narrative voice has also been chal lenged. The leading proponent of the "non-narrator" theory in literature is Ann Banfield, who argues that anonymous nar ration?typically, the nineteenth-century omniscient narrator or the twentieth century ''camera-eye" narration of a Robbe-Grillet or a Hemingway?does not involve a communication model, and hence does not require the concept of a narrator or a "sender" of the narrative discourse. Other theorists, however, ar gue that the category of the narrator com prises the most significant aspect of narra tive form. Mieke Bal, for one, asserts that the narrator is the most central con cept in the analysis of narrative texts. The identity of the narrator, the de gree to which and the manner in which that identity is indicated in the text, and the choices that are implied lend the text its particular character. (Narratolo gy 120) In theories of film, the importance of des ignating an illocutionary source has until now appeared to be minimal. Arguing that the verbal model which subtends the con cept of the narrator is inappropriate in film, recent texts by Bordwell, Branigan, and Henderson have proclaimed the no tion of narrative voice to be, in Bordwell's words, an "anthropomorphic fiction," (62), or in Henderson's phrase a "second rate act" that merely attempts to "mimic the novelistic voice" ("Tense" 17). In arguing that fictions involving a personal ized narrator are sharply distinct from those involving anonymous, impersonal narration?the mode employed in the ma jority of films?these theorists, to a greater or lesser degree, share the concep tual framework of the literary narratolo gists Banfield, S. Y. Kuroda, and K?the Hamburger. The "non-narrator" theory of impersonal fiction argues that because nothing akin to a human presence or a speaking subject can be discerned as the source of certain narratives, it is easier to assume that, in Benveniste's words, "nobody speaks," or that the events simply "tell themselves" 4 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="3">(208). Banfield's position is that fictional sentences of an impersonal type contain utterances that are impossible in either natural communication or in personal fic tion. An example is the omniscient narra tor of nineteenth-century fiction, who might fluidly record the subjective pro cesses of a particular character, while at the same time referring to that character in the third person. This type of narrator cannot be thought of as a substitute speaker, a human being, or an illocution ary source in a communicative situation: such a text is "freed from the speech act" (Banfield 445). Another example of an ostensibly non narrative mode of impersonal fiction is the anonymous reporting voice or invisible witness style of narration characteristic of Ernest Hemingway or Alain Robbe Grillet. Labeled "camera-eye" narration by Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this style minimizes the agency of the narrator: the characters, the settings, and the implied reference world appear to communicate directly, with the narrator relegated to a passive observational or recording role. This type of narrator is totally deprived of individuating, human characteristics, re sulting in a text that also appears to be freed from the speech act, although in a different way than in the omniscient form. The proponents of the non-narrator theory argue that if, as in the case of the omni scient form, the narrator cannot be under stood as a human being, while in the case of the "invisible witness" form the narra tor has no individuating or personalizing characteristics, why should one resort to the concept of the narrator at all? In film, such a view seems quite plausible. Because the narrator is characteristically invisible and inaudible, film seems to present a direct and unmediated recording of events, free of a narrator's colorations and inflections. Branigan appears to en dorse this view, which he describes as an empirical theory of narration, and places the stress accordingly on the reading pro cess: I want to emphasize, however, that in my view of narration there is no con sciousness of a narrator to produce (originate) sentences which then con trol meaning for a reader but exactly the reverse: the systematic restric tions perceived by the reader within a text are simply labeled as "narration" in order to be located when needed in the logical process of reading. (59) Bordwell's view of narration, while not explicity related to Banfield's, is very sim ilar. But in watching films we are seldom aware of being told something by an entity resembling a human being . . . Most films do not provide anything like such a definable narrator, and there is no reason to expect they will . . . Far better, I think, to give the narrational process the power to sig nal under certain circumstances that the spectator should construct a nar rator ... we need not build the nar rator in on the ground floor of our theory.(62) Bordwell replaces the concept of the nar rator with "narration" itself, arguing that the film-text provides the cues and the organizing principles necessary for the spectator to construct the meaning and form of the story: "Narration is better understood as the organization of a set of cues for the construction of a story. This presupposes a perceiver, but not any sender, of a message" (62). But there are many literary and film theo rists who believe the concept of the narra tor is logically and pragmatically neces sary for all fictions. In literary theory, Ryan has argued compellingly that the narrator need not be construed on an anthropomorphic basis. In impersonal fic tion the narratorial function is preserved, JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 5</page><page sequence="4">she contends, but it does not have a psy chological dimension. Nor is one required. This type of narrator is not seen as a consciousness or a fictional human being interposed between the mind of the author and the mind of the characters; instead, the impersonal narrator represents a "zero-degree" of individuation, which presupposes only one activity?the ability to narrate a story. The concept of narrator is a logical necessity of all fictions, but it has no psychological foundation in the im personal case. This means that there is no need for the reader of imper sonal narrations to seek an answer to the question "who speaks?" (519) In film, comparable positions have been set out in the work of Casetti, Gaudreault, and Chatman, but their work is based on different premises than those of literary narratologists such as Ryan and Lubom mir Dolezel. While sharing the view that the narrator can be free of psychological properties, in other respects their ap proaches are widely divergent. In marked contrast to the more unified approach of the non-narrator theorists, writers arguing for the presence of a narrator in film draw on diverse kinds of evidence and employ a variety of methods. Rather than indicating theoretical error, however, the presence of several different theories of the cine matic narrator reflects the incomplete de velopment of the concept, for each of these theories can be seen as a partial solution to a challenging problem. In my view, theories of the cinematic narrator can benefit from the insights of Ryan, Dolezel, and others concerning the logic and pragmatics of impersonal narra tion. Most importantly, this theory allows us to answer affirmatively the question of whether a narrator is required in theories of cinematic narration. I will argue, fol lowing Ryan and Dolezel, that the cate gory of the narrator provides the funda mental component of the basic fictional contract that narrative film establishes with the spectator, and secondly, that it establishes the means of distinguishing and evaluating the hierarchy of narrative voices structuring the narrative film. These distinctions are essential for sorting out the authentic motifs or facts of the fictional world from inauthentic motifs produced through activities such as unre liable narration, or, in a more complicated case, ironic narration. The importance of the narrator to the overall fictional contract resides in the fact that only the narrator can produce truth functional discourse within what is mani festly a fictional construct. In other words, within the overall narrative contract in which a fiction is related to an addressee, there is another level in which a narrator tells the truth about the fictional world. As Ryan writes: [The narrative] concerns what is, from the point of view of author and reader, an alternate possible world, but on the level of the embedded contract, speaker and hearer commu nicate about what is for them the real world. Every narrative text whose narrator is not hallucinating presup poses a level where a speaker tells a story as true fact and not as inven tion. (524) The "true facts" of the fictional world cannot be accounted for by referring to the author, for he or she cannot endorse the truth-value of what is manifestly a fictional creation. Only at the level of the embed ded contract between narrator and narra tee that all fiction entails can we have truth-functional discourse within an over all fictional construction. The value of this concept is placed in relief in cases of unreliable narration. Existing theories of cinematic narration have been unable to satisfactorily resolve the ques tion of narrational unreliability, as evi denced by the diverse solutions proposed 6 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="5">for such notorious effects as the "lying flashback" in Alfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright. By focusing on this issue, we can demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of impersonal narration for film. The core concept of the theory of impersonal narra tion is that impersonal narrative discourse involves two activities: it both creates or constructs the fictional world while at the same time referring to it as if it had an autonomous existence, as if it preexisted the illocutionary act. By contrast, per sonal narration?for example, the narra tion of a character-narrator?does not cre ate the fictional world, but simply reports on it, in the manner of a witness or partic ipant. The paradoxical situation of imper sonal narration?narrative discourse as world-creating as well as world-reflect ing?allows us to conceive the narrator as both the illocutionary source of the fic tional world and as the agent who com ments on, evaluates, qualifies, and embel lishes the facts of the fictional world. In creating the fictional world, the imper sonal narrator produces a type of dis course that is read directly as the facts of the "real world" of the fictional universe. The impersonal narrator's lack of human personality allows the viewer to imagine that he or she is confronting the fictional universe directly, putting aside any reflec tion on the form of the narrative dis course. What Felix Martinez-Bonati calls the "mimetic stratum" of the work is not experienced as narrative discourse, but rather directly as the world. As Ryan writes in a review of this work: "the reader does not simply conclude 'the nar rator says p' from the narrator's mimetic statements, he also derives 'p is the case' and regards as an unmediated fact of the real world of the fictional universe" ("Fic tion" 131). This is even more apparent in film, where the narrational discourse, con sisting of a range of visual and acoustic signals, is primarily read as the facts of the fictional world, and only secondarily as a formal pattern of images and sounds. Because the narrator produces the dis course through which the viewer recon structs the fictional world, this discourse comprises the facts of the fictional uni verse, which always carry the value of authenticity. Consequently, the discourse of the impersonal narrator in film is always reliable in the most basic sense: this type of narrator cannot lie about the fictional world, although the narrator can withhold information and cause the spectator to make incorrect inferences. Lying narra tion in film can only be engendered by the discourse of a personal, character-nar rator. In producing the facts of the fic tional world, the impersonal narrator cre ates a universe that, once established, cannot be revoked, for this discourse pro vides the very basis of the fictional world, forming the material building blocks of the fictional universe. Any kind of false report or lie on the part of the impersonal narra tor?which in film might take the form of images which are directly presented as facts, without the intermediate agency of a personal narrator, and which are then con tradicted by other images?would simply be taken as incoherence in the fictional world itself, leading the spectator to ques tion the very existence of a diegetic uni verse. The personal, character-narrator, on the other hand, does not create a world, but simply reports on it. Thus he or she can distort the facts of the fictional world, which still remain intact despite the false report. Contrary to the opinion of many writers, however, the unreliable charac ter-narrator can utilize images as well as words, as seen in Stage Fright. Although some writers, such as Kozloff, argue that it is the convention of realism that pre vents the image-track from distorting the truth (115), and others, such as Bordwell, that the lying narration in Stage Fright does not simply "report what the liar said but shows it as if it were indeed objec tively true" (61), the reliability of the image depends entirely on whether it is produced by the discourse of a personal JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 7</page><page sequence="6">narrator as opposed to the impersonal narrator. As Ryan says, "everything the impersonal narrator says yields a fact for the fictional world" (534), while the per sonal narrator, by contrast, "has to earn his authentication authority" (Dolezel 18). The second activity involved in imper sonal narration is the power of referring to the fictional world as if it had an indepen dent existence. Through this capacity, the impersonal narrator can comment on the fictional world, evaluate it, indicate the accuracy of different reports concerning the fictional world, and take an ironic stance towards the events and the charac ters of the fictional universe. One of the principal ways the narrator manifests this capacity is by endorsing or repudiating the views of the fictional characters within the story-world. This function is most evident in two-tiered films involving an unreliable character-narrator. There are two ways in which unreliable character-narration in film can be shown to be invalid: one is explicit correction by the impersonal narrator, who may intro duce images which are at odds with the character-narrator's dialogue, as in Robert Altman's Fool for Love, where the image track at times deviates from and at times explicitly contradicts the discourse of the personal narrator. The other way a char acter's discourse can be shown to be in valid is from inside the story-world? through other characters' accounts or through evident discrepancies between the character-narrator's report and the re vealed facts of the story-world, as in Stage Fright. Both methods of exposing unreli ability derive from the dual capacities of the impersonal narrator. The first means of correction involves the evaluation of the fictional world and its inhabitants as if it and they had an independent existence: in Fool For Love, the narrator enters the fictional world from the 'outside' in order to correct the false report, as if to 'set the record straight.' The second means of correction stems from the narrator's power to create the facts of the fictional world, the "mimetic stratum," which per mits characters, such as Eve in Stage Fright, to test the truth-value of represen tations made by other characters. The issue of authenticity in filmic dis course has been posed most directly in the debates surrounding Stage Fright. The problems raised by this film have provided the occasion for a kind of referendum on the subject of the cinematic narrator, with different theorists proposing a variety of models to account for the relation between the narrative discourse, the "facts" of the fictional world, and the "lying" report of the character-narrator. Casetti and Chat man have both formulated models of cin ematic narration based on this work. Each of these treatments is illuminating, provid ing new insights into the hierarchical structure of narrative discourse. But each, I will argue, elucidates only one attribute of the dualistic agency involved in imper sonal narration. In reviewing these argu ments, I hope to show that the model of impersonal narration I am proposing can serve to synthesize these two useful ap proaches. Casetti focuses on the role of the "enun ciator"?a kind of hybrid of the external narrator and the implied author?in vali dating or sanctioning one character's ver sion of events over another in Cronaca di un amore by Antonioni and in Stage Fright. He describes this role in terms of four functions or manifestations of author ity: competence, performance, mandate, and sanction. When the enunciator trans fers this role to an internal character narrator, all of these qualities must be present for the discourse of the character narrator to be taken as authentic. By de tailing just which of these powers is as signed to the internal narrators and narratees of both stories, he discovers that the attribute of sanction is withheld from the characters of Cronaca, and also with held from Jonathon, the "lying" internal narrator of Stage Fright. While these di 8 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="7">egetic characters initially seem to possess all that is required to assume the duties of the enunciator?to have a mandate, a competence, and an ability to perform (convey) the story?the crucial quality of being able to predicate, to sanction the story is missing. Casetti's treatment of the problem is instructive and deserves to be quoted at length. [T]he detective, Paolo, and Guido [in Cronaca] need something extra to rat ify what they have been observing. They need a sanction ... a sort of control coupon as a seal of guarantee ... it would legitimize the presence and performance of the characters . . . But like the mandate, the sanc tion too cannot reach the interested parties unless someone weighs their actions from the outside . . . Put an other way, the sanction needs, be sides some pieces on the chessboard, a referee who controls the game from outside; besides a receiver who is evaluated, a sender who evaluates; besides subjects who act, a subject who approves or condemns an action through an epistemological judge ment. These dimensions are precisely what is lacking. (76) Casetti's argument details the process whereby predication authority is withheld from a character-narrator, leading to the disauthentication of Jonathon's version of events in Stage Fright. The sanction, or guarantee, which validates the truth status of an alternative version of events emerges through the empowering of the character Eve, who receives the ratifica tion of the enunciator, according to the author, through her investigative ability. In its overall contours, Casetti's argument seems to be perfectly congruent with the concept of impersonal narration as de scribed above. Because the character narrator merely reports on a world, rather than creating it, his reliability must be confirmed. Where everything the imper sonai narrator fashions yields a fact for the fictional world, the character-narrator has to earn his or her authority, and is always subject to the endorsement or repudiation of a higher narratorial agent. Writers such as Frank Tomasulo on Citizen Kane and Henderson on Badlands have also ana lyzed the way the discourse of the external narrator may correct, bracket out, or re visualize a scene supposedly controlled by the internal character-narrator. But Casetti's model involves only one of the two functions associated with imper sonal narration?the power to refer to the fictional world as if it existed indepen dently of the illocutionary act. The narra tor, or enunciator, is here vested only with the capacity to manage the discourse from outside the world of the story. Standing at the top of the pyramid of narration, the enunciator "weighs the actions [of the characters] from the outside" (Casetti 76), evaluates the truth claims of various points of view, and assigns or withholds predication authority. Casetti's enunciator thus fulfills the capacity of the narrator to refer to the fictional world. Impersonal narration, however, which I believe is the mode characteristic of film, does more than simply refer to the fic tional world. It also creates the fictional world?a world which is experienced not as the discourse of a narrator situated outside the story but rather directly as the autonomous facts of the fictional universe, the level Martinez-Bonati calls the mi metic stratum of the work. While Casetti's model emphasizes the ability of the enun ciator to manage the fictional world, it does not deal with the construction of the fictional world itself as a narratorial act. The enunciator thus remains a rather ghostly presence, manifested only through the abstract power of sanctioning one or another version of events?a sanctioning that takes place in an extremely nebulous fashion. Because the enunciator here merely re ports on a world, rather than creating it, JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 9</page><page sequence="8">the characters within the story-world can assume the enunciatori full range of pow ers: they can disclose the facts of the fictional universe and distinguish accurate reports from false reports. In short, they can "define and determine the truth" and the reliability of other characters (85). This leads him to posit a homology be tween Eve and the enunciator. Moreover, he posits an identity between the charac ter and the author: "The narratee ac quires, in other words, the role of the manager of the discourse; and whomever allies himself with the 'Author,' in seeing and hearing, becomes a kind of co author" (84). The "truth of the text," however, and the reliability of characters purporting to speak that truth, can be measured only against the authentic facts of the fictional universe, which are a priori constructed by the anonymous or impersonal narrator. As Dolezel notes, only the discourse of the anonymous narrator carries the au thentication authority essential to con structing a world (12, 13). This capacity to construct a world cannot be assigned to characters within that world. Thus there is a very sharp distinction to be drawn be tween the activity of the enunciator and the activity of the character, even if the character, like Eve, is vested with the power to verify the truth of the text. The concept of truth, in fact, is a secondary form of evaluation predicated upon the enunciator's prior creation of the authen tic facts of the fictional world. As Dolezel writes: Let us emphasize that the concept of truth and the criteria of truth in fic tional narratives are subordinated to the concept of authentication. Fic tional truth is strictly "truth in/of the constructed narrative world and its criterion is agreement or disagree ment with authenticated narrative facts. (15) In failing to take into account the narra tor's construction of the fictional world, Casetti's model limits the narrator's activ ity to functions that are in fact alienable to the characters?namely the evaluation of the reliability of agents operating within the fictional world. The consequence is that the category of the enunciator, which appeared to form the basis of this model, becomes superfluous, for the essential ac tivities of Casetti's enunciator can be wholly delegated to a character. As a model of cinematic narration, Casetti's treatment is incomplete, for it is based on only one of the two activities that define the process of narration. The work of Seymour Chatman on the cinematic narrator focuses not on authen tication authority, but rather on the narra tor's power to present the fictional world through the multiple registers involved in cinematic representation. In direct con trast to Bordwell and Branigan, Chatman explicitly endorses the communication model of narrative transmission, maintain ing that the notion of a narrative "mes sage" presupposes the concept of a "sender": " 'Sender' is logically impli cated by 'message'; a sender is by defini tion built-in: inscribed or immanent in every message" ("Review" 140). The message, however, need not be "told"; that is, it need not be presented in verbal form. The concept of voice, after all, even in verbal fictions, is usually a metaphor. Rather than "vocalization," Chatman points out, narrative voice refers to a kind of encoding that denotes a source or sender of the signifying material. The story can in fact be shown rather than told, presented iconically rather than lin guistically. Chatman's theory of the narra tor as a constitutive element of fictional communication extends even to the most mimetic aspects of the film-text: "Even the most mimetic text is narrated to the extent that it comes to us as presented'" (Coming To Terms). In the cinema, this narratorial encoding is complex and utilizes both visual and aural channels: lighting, editing, camera angle 10 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="9">and movement, color, and mise-en-scene can all be attributed to the visual articula tions of the narrator. Music and voice over or voice-off can be understood as its aural manifestations. For Chatman, the film-text is narrated in all its details; the activity of a narrator pervades every as pect of the text. This comprehensive view of the narrator's activity can be compared to Rimmon-Kenan's view of literary nar ration: [T]here is always a teller in the tale, at least in the sense that any utterance, or record of an utterance, presup poses someone who has uttered it. Even when a narrative text presents passages of pure dialogue, manuscript found in a bottle, or forgotten letters and diaries, there is in addition to the speakers or writers of this discourse a "higher" narratorial authority respon sible for "quoting" the dialogue or "transcribing" the written records. (88) Chatman emphasizes the role of the cine matic narrator in presenting the fictional world, but in his view, this presentation does not carry the value of authenticity. Because his narrator merely presents the fictional world rather than constructing it, there is nothing to distinguish the activity of the cinematic narrator from that of the character-narrator. In order to distinguish, then, between the authentic and inauthen tic versions of events in Stage Fright, Chatman must appeal to another, outside authority?the implied author: Clearly, Johnny narrates the first, un true version of the story: that means that he is its narrator, he and he alone, and that everything we see and hear originates with him . . . since every cinematic tool?editing, light ing, commentative music, etc.? contributes to his intention. Only later does a reliable narrator take up the correct story, at which point all the cinematic tools shift to its disposal . . . The implied author is the agent intrinsic to the story whose responsi bility is the overall design?including precisely the decisions to have two conflicting narratives. The two narra tors are the more immediate source and generator of the narratives. One of the components of the first narra tive is a (character-)narrator's voice. That component is dropped in the second narrative, perhaps on the con vention that the "facts can speak for themselves. ("Review" 141) This view, however, contradicts the basic logical distinction between personal and impersonal narrators. As we know from Ryan, everything produced by the imper sonal narrator yields a fact for the fictional world. The personal narrator, on the other hand, does not produce facts with any thing like the same degree of authenticity: the character-narrator has to earn his au thentication authority. Despite the fact that Johnny controls the entire cinematic apparatus, the introduction of his dis course under the sign of character narration lets us know immediately that this discourse must be shown to agree with the facts of the fictional world, estab lished by the impersonal narrator, before it can be taken as authentic. Both Casetti and Chatman argue that the narrative world of Stage Fright must be authenticated, or sanctioned, in order for the true version of events to emerge. But each writer supplies a different solution to the problem of authentication. Where Ca setti finds authentication authority ulti mately residing in the character Eve, who becomes an authorized delegate of the enunciator, or the Author, Chatman ap peals to the implied author as the only guarantor of the facts of the fictional world. It is the implied author, for Chat man, who sets out two versions of the story, allowing us to judge which one is true and which is false. But as we have argued above, the question of unreliable narration is subsumed under JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 11</page><page sequence="10">the larger distinction between personal and impersonal narration, a distinction which Chatman does not acknowledge. The two versions of the story do not have an equal textual validity, and do not re quire us to read the intention of the im plied author to have knowledge of the truth. Rather, the two versions are clearly marked as belonging to separate orders: one is the highly questionable discourse of the personal narrator, Johnny; the other proceeds from the disclosure of the au thentic facts of the fictional world, created by the impersonal narrator. Another problem with Chatman's model is that the implied author has no voice of his own, and thus cannot be understood as the addresser or sender in a communicative situation. Chatman himself states this di rectly: Unlike the narrator, the implied au thor can tell us nothing. He, or better, it has no voice, no direct means of communicating. It instructs us si lently, through the design of the whole, with all the voices, by all the means it has chosen to let us learn. (Story and Discourse 148) The question of truth and authenticity in narrative, however, depends on an agent who can authenticate the propositions as serted in the text, or better, whose dis course carries the value of authenticity. Since the implied author hides behind the narrator, "it is on the say-so of an absen tee speaker that the reader gathers the building blocks of the fictional world" (Ryan 527). Having no voice, the implied author cannot assert the propositions that can be used to construe the authentic facts of the fictional world. When Chatman asks us to read the intentions of the implied author, he asks us to go outside the fic tional contract which establishes the nar rator as the agent responsible for truth functional discourse within the overall fictional situation. Chatman's insistence on the role of the implied author derives, it seems to me, from the need in certain texts to distin guish the values and beliefs of the narrator from those of the implied author. In cases where the narrator's judgements, atti tudes, or tastes are clearly questionable or offensive, the implied author may be seen as providing a kind of silent criticism or qualification of the narrator's authority, as in novels such as The Collector by John Fowles. Such a situation arises, however, only in cases of personal narration, where a narrator has a psychological foundation and a personality that would allow us to construe it as a human being, replete with the potential for human error and human bias. In the case of impersonal narration, the lack of human personality protects the narrator from the errors, misjudgements, or perversions of a personal narrator. Moreover, personal narration is always enclosed within the enveloping discourse of impersonal narration in film. As we know from Henderson, Tomasulo, Koz loff, and David Alan Black, the discourse of a personal character-narrator does not comprise the whole of the text, or inflect every detail of it, but instead has a limited and discrete role which is subsumed within the overarching discourse of the general cinematic narrator. One of the functions of the general cinematic narra tor, or the impersonal narrator in the model I am proposing, is to validate or expose the discourse of the personal char acter-narrator. Impersonal narration thus eliminates the need for the category of the implied author. It appears that the lack of distinction in Chatman's approach be tween personal and impersonal narration leads him to posit the implied author as the final arbiter of truth and authenticity in the text, a role which falls within the purview of the impersonal or anonymous narrator. The primary shortcoming of the two ap proaches discussed above is their inability to articulate both the world-creating and the world-reflecting elements of cinematic narration in a single model. However, in 12 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="11">the work of Andr? Gaudreault?the third model of cinematic narration which I will discuss?this dual structuration is placed in the forefront. Gaudreault argues that filmic narration consists of a superimposition of a mimetic and a non-mimetic form of diegesis, a lamination of "monstration" and narra tion. Film both presents the event mimet ically, through monstration, and refigures the event, at a second level, according to the guiding viewpoint of a narrator. The chief distinction marking the two modes, according to Gaudreault, is the introduc tion of a complex temporality characteris tic of narration?the insertion of a "true narrative past" into a seemingly mimetic event, a "time of reflection" between the moment at which an event occurred and the moment at which it is received. Monstration, in general, is the act of "showing forth," of presenting events in present time, a kind of "rigorously syn chronous simultaneous narration" (32). In most instances, monstration is bound to a single temporality, the present, and can only "show" or "display" events as they occur. While the purest mode of monstra tion is found in the theater, with its unwa vering present tense, monstration also oc curs in film in the direct presentation of events as if they were occurring in present-tense immediacy. In Gaudreault's theory, the camera is the chief device of the monstrator. The "unipunctual time" of monstration can be refashioned only through a second narrative inscription. It is only through narration that the temporal flow of the film can be restructured according to a specific logic and intent, and only through narra tion that a gap can be introduced, a "time of reflection," between the occurrence and its recounting. As Gaudreault writes: [T]he "unipunctuality" to which the monstrator is bound prevents it irre ducibly from modulating the temporal flow of the narrative . . . It is because the monstrator, any monstrator, clings so closely to the immediacy of the "representation" that it is incapa ble of opening up this gap in the temporal continuum. . . . Only the narrator can sweep us along on its flying carpet through time. (33, 32) The chief code through which the cine matic narrator expresses itself is editing: it is editing, Gaudreault argues, that com prises the "activity of the filmic narrator which allows for the inscription of a true narrative past" (32). Editing allows for the introduction of a "time of reflection" be tween the moment when events have oc curred, rendered in the form of monstra tion, and the moment that they are received by a narratee, allowing the event to be re-placed before the eyes of the spectator in whatever order the narrator desires, producing a "guided reading." The mastery of time is the privileged form by which the narrator manifests itself, taking the events recorded by the mon strator-camera and restructuring them ac cording to a guiding temporal logic. Only the narrator (= the editor) can inscribe between two shots (by means of cuts and articulations) the mark of its viewpoint, can introduce a guided reading and thereby transcend the temporal oneness which unavoidably constrains the discourse of monstra tion. (33) Gaudreault argues that filmic narration consists of a unique merging of these two modes of communication, a combination of narration and monstration?in essence, two types of narration: the monstration expressed at the level of the individual shot, and the narration made possible by editing and its power over the temporal dimension. This approach has elements in common with the model of impersonal narration set forth above. We can compare the super JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990) 13</page><page sequence="12">imposition of monstration and narration in Gaudreault to the world-creating and world-reflecting activities characteristic of all impersonal narration, both in film and in literature. The activity of monstration can be understood to correspond to the activity of creating the fictional world, while the secondary inscription of the nar rator?allowing the articulation of a "true narrative past"?may be perceived as the equivalent of commentary, judgement, and evaluation, in which the narrator re fers to the fictional world as if it had independent existence. Unlike Gaud reault, however, I believe that this dual level of inscription is characteristic of all impersonal narration, and should not be restricted to film. If one of the chief goals of narratological inquiry is a unified theory of narrative, applicable to all narrative forms, then we should seek to link the striking characteristics of filmic narration, which are specified by Gaudreault, to other narrative forms. The model I have elaborated throughout the course of this essay, however, departs from Gaudreault in other significant ways, as well. For one, Gaudreault's distinction between monstration and narration de pends on the rigid segregation of camera work and editing. Aside from reprising one of the oldest oppositions in film theo ry?which, as he points out has informed the theories of Eisenstein, Bal?zs, and Bazin?this separation leads to an unfor tunate atomization of the film-text. Clearly, camerawork can function as nar ration, insofar as camera angle, move ment, and shot size can provide the equiv alent of a "guided reading." Indeed, the entire complex of cinematic representa tion, including lighting, image texture, color, sound, music, voice-over?in short, all the codes that Chatman associates with the narratorial presentation of the fictional world?can also be employed to convey the cinematic analogue of commentary, evaluation, and emphasis that Gaudreault wishes to reserve only for editing. This can be demonstrated by considering the device of irony in film. The impersonal narrator can express an ironic stance towards the events and the inhabitants of the fictional world not only through edit ing, but through a complex of cinematic devices. In the film Blue Velvet, for exam ple, the images that form the fictional world cannot be taken strictly at face value. From the hallucinatory intensity of the tulips and the roses at the beginning of the film to the mechanical robin at the end, a high degree of irony sets the discourse of the film off from the actual fictional world. Color, mise-en-scene, music, and sound effects all contribute to the gap between the mimetic universe and the narration. This discrepancy can be accounted for only by resorting to the concept of a narrator whose intent is to present the fictional world and to qualify it at the same time. The facts of the fictional world are not in doubt, as they are in the false character-narration of Stage Fright, but they are subject to ironic declarations. These ironic declarations, which set the discourse of the film in a skewed relation ship to the fictional world, cannot be seen as an objective property of the shots, the music, the color, or the camerawork, but must be seen rather as the product of the intent of the narrator both to construct and to comment on the fictional world, to produce, in short, a guided reading of the fictional universe. Gaudreault's argument hinges, however, not on his valorization of editing as the principle vehicle of cinematic narration, but rather on his insistence that the de fining characteristic of narration is the temporal gap between the time of the event and the time of the telling. This is a well-founded distinction that conforms to accepted narratological concepts, and is supported by the theories of Genette and others. Temporal distance as a prerequi site of narrative discourse can be under stood, however, in terms of the distinction set out above between the narrator's con struction of the fictional world and the 14 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 42.1 (Spring 1990)</page><page sequence="13">activity of referring to it as if it were a pr?existent entity. By recasting the prob lem of dual temporalities in terms of the more fundamental distinction between world-creating and world-reflecting activ ities of narration, we can avoid the prob lem of assigning narratorial capacities only to those codes or figures that have conven tionally been used to overtly manipulate temporal relations, such as editing. The temporal gap Gaudreault rightly demands of a theory of cinematic narration can be found in the capacity of the impersonal narrator to comment on the fictional world as if it had an autonomous existence, prior to and independent of the narrator's illo cutionary act. Although cases of unreliable and ironic narration in film are uncommon, the model I have set forth in these pages provides a comprehensive approach to the problem of cinematic narration. Rather than sup posing that some films require the concept of a narrator while others do not, I have argued that the category of the narrator is a fundamental component of fictional expression in the cinema, and that both mimetic and commentative elements of the film-text can be accounted for with this model. This approach proceeds from a direction opposite to that of the non narrator theorists. Rather than focusing on the spectator or receiver of the narrative message, I have emphasized the fictional instance of emission, maintaining that the crucial quality of truth and authenticity in the fictional world can be understood only if we recognize the existence of an agent who is bound by the fictional contract to convey the facts of the fictional universe. In surveying the work of theorists who endorse the concept of the cinematic nar rator, I have tried to indicate the value of certain ideas. The concept of sanction or predication authority in Casetti, the de scription of cinematic narration as involv ing all the codes of expression in film in Chatman, and the dualistic model of nar ration set forth in Gaudreault are useful concepts which I believe can now be seen as contributory to the theory of imper sonal narration.
