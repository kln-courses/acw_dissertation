<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Rabbi and the Jesuit:  On Rabbi Jonathan  Eibeschütz and Father  Franciscus Haselbauer  Editing the Talmud Paweł Maciejko Abstract  The heavily censored Prague edition of tractate Berakhot of the Babylonian Talmud,  published in Prague in 1728, was the product of collaboration between Franciscus  Haselbauer, the Jesuit censor of Hebrew books in Bohemia, and Jonathan Eibeschütz,  the prodigy of the Prague rabbinate. In contrast to most censored editions of Hebrew  books in the early modern period, the Prague Talmud featured extensive rewriting,  rather than only expurgating, of the text. Drawing on archival materials, this article  analyzes the backdrop of the publication and the changes introduced by the editors,  teasing out the theological assumptions underlying the publishing enterprise. Key words: Talmud, Jonathan Eibeschütz, Prague, censorship I n both academic scholarship and Jewish collective memory, the best-known controversies concerning Rabbi Jonathan Eibe-schütz (1690–1764) are those about his kabbalistic tract Va-avo  ha-yom el ha-‘ayin (And I Came This Day unto the Fountain, 1725–26),  whose critical edition I published recently, and about the allegedly  Sabbatean amulets that he distributed to the members of the com- munities of Metz and Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck in the 1750s.  However, during his early years, the most important controversy con- cerning Eibeschütz was not the dispute surrounding his suspected  Sabbateanism and the heterodox writings attributed to him but  Paweł Maciejko, “The Rabbi and the Jesuit: On Rabbi Jonathan Eibeschütz  and Father Franciscus Haselbauer Editing the Talmud,” Jewish Social Studies:  History, Culture, Society n.s. 20, no. 2 (Winter 2014): 147–184 </page> <page sequence="2"> rather the outrage engendered by his friendly relations with the local  Catholic clergy and his alleged involvement in the publication of  [148] heavily censored editions of the Pentateuch, the Talmud, and the  prayer book.1 In the eyes of many contemporaries, the damage  Jewish caused by the appearance of these latter publications vastly overshad- Social owed any harm stemming from the heretical views expressed in Eibe- Studies schütz’s kabbalistic works and amulets. • The Prague editions came to the attention of the nineteenth-  Vol. 20 No. 2 century historians Rafael Rabinowicz and Heinrich Graetz, who held  Eibeschütz responsible for “butchering and spoiling the entire trac- tate” of the Talmud.2 Yet the evidence they adduced was surprisingly  thin, consisting mainly of a one-paragraph note from a work of Eibe- schütz’s archenemy, Jacob Emden’s Sefer hitabbekut (Book of Struggle).3  The censored versions of the Pentateuch, which appeared with Targum  Onkelos and the commentaries of Rashi and Nahmanides, and of trac- tate Berakhot of the Babylonian Talmud, the first volume of an intended  complete edition of the work, were published in 1728 in Prague; the  siddur was published three years later, in 1731. Sefer hitabbekut was com- posed in 1762, at the height of the controversy between the two rabbis:  both Emden’s objectivity and the exactness of his knowledge of the  events that took place 30 years prior to his writing and in which he  never participated directly may be questioned. The only extant account  of the outrage engendered by the Prague publications written during  the time they appeared is in a letter from Moses Hagiz, at the time re- siding as a private citizen in Altona, to Isaac Ayzik Zelig, the rabbi of  Kalisz and a member of the Council of the Four Lands of Poland. Hagiz  wrote the letter in Altona on 1 Tevet 5487 (December 25, 1726). Jacob  Prager, an anti-Sabbatean, copied and included it in his collection of  testimonies pertaining to Sabbatean controversies, entitled Gahalei esh  (Fiery Coals), in the 1750s.4 In his letter to Zelig, Hagiz reported that “certain individuals”  from the Prague community “secretly conspired to obtain from the  high sages of the Jesuit order [hakhamim ha-romemim asher ba-bayit ha- komarim ha-yesuiter] permission to print the Talmud according to  their [i.e., Christian] tradition.”5 Furthermore, he informed the Pol- ish rabbi, “there had arrived a writ listing what should be added and  what removed from the [talmudic] aggadot [stories]”6 The printing of  the Talmud had already begun, and the leaders of the community  missed the opportunity to prevent the publication of tractate Berakhot.  However, according to Hagiz, there was still time to hinder the pro- cess of publication of the remaining tractates. In order to do so, the  Jewish authorities needed to act swiftly and decisively and to intercede  </page> <page sequence="3"> with Christians about the matter. If they failed to do so, “there  [would] never be an end to the matter”: errors and distortions in the  talmudic text would accumulate and future generations would not be [149] able to recognize them anymore.7 These errors would engender ad- ditional errors and doubt would be cast upon all future editions of The Rabbi and  the centerpieces of the Jewish canon. At the end of his letter, Hagiz the Jesuit asked Zelig to intercede with other rabbis in Poland to embark upon • the most radical course of action possible: to obtain an official rab- Paweł  Maciejko binic ruling ordering Jews to burn the Prague Talmud. The burning of the Talmud, an act first performed after the Paris  disputation of 1242 and repeated many times throughout the Middle  Ages and the early modern era, mainly in the papal states, was fraught  with symbolic associations. To my knowledge, Hagiz’s letter is the only  instance in Jewish history whereby a prominent rabbinic authority sup- ported the idea and even called to execute such a burning. Hagiz must  have known that the proposed burning would have a profound impact  on Jews not only in Bohemia but also beyond its boundaries. In Prague,  it would also have direct practical consequences. Following the publica- tion of the Talmud in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1697–1715 and its  smuggling from Prussia to the Habsburg domains, the Prague Jesuits  initiated a campaign of book confiscations. In 1712, a specially estab- lished commission of three Jesuit theologians carried out searches in  homes throughout the city and seized a large number of Jewish books.  On July 27, 1714, Emperor Charles VI, at the request of the Jesuits, is- sued an edict demanding that every Jewish book in Bohemia be  brought to the Prague town hall for inspection. Those who failed to  comply within six weeks of the publication of the edict would have all of  their books confiscated.8 Thousands of volumes were deposited at the  town hall, and the authorities quickly realized that they did not have  the manpower to implement the project of checking all the books for  illicit content.9 After December 1714, Jews were required only to submit  lists of the titles in their possession and not the actual books. Both the  books seized prior to the relaxation of the imperial ruling and those on  the lists composed after it was relaxed were to be divided into three  categories: works strictly forbidden, those due for expurgation, and  those that were permitted. Many books belonging to the first category,  and apparently also some belonging to the second, were destroyed in  several burnings that took place in Prague between 1713 and 1716.10  In 1863, Gershon Wolf published an inventory of the books confis- cated by the Prague Jesuits.11 In addition to the titles of the books, the  inventory contains the number of seized copies of each title. According  to Wolf’s list, copies of the Talmud—obviously belonging to the first  </page> <page sequence="4"> group of books, warranting immediate incineration—were by far the  most numerous of the sequestered works. The Jesuits impounded 135  [150] copies of the Talmud—it is not clear if the number refers to complete  sets of the Talmud or, more likely, to single volumes of talmudic trac- Jewish tates. It is clear, however, that the Talmud was one of the works found  Social most often among the books confiscated and burned by the Jesuits and  Studies the main target of the campaign initiated by the censors. In the 10  • years from 1715 to 1725, very few copies (according to some sources,  Vol. 20 No. 2 none) of the Talmud existed in Bohemia. Rabbis and rabbinic students  were in dire need of this most fundamental text of Jewish learning, and  a publication of the Talmud in Prague would have satisfied the de- mand. Still, in his letter to Zelig, Hagiz presented the edition prepared  by “individuals from the Prague community” and their Jesuit backers  as so harmful that he wanted to have it, too, burned completely; in his  opinion, the edition had been corrupted to such an extent that it was  better not to have any edition. Although Hagiz qualified his call for a  rabbinic injunction to burn the Prague Talmud by emphasizing that  the expected ruling should be temporary and should refer only to this  particular edition, he knew that he was—quite literally—playing with  fire. His initiative had the potential to spiral out of control and fuel an- other Christian campaign against Jewish books. Hagiz explicitly men- tioned the possibility that his proposed course of action might lead to  more burnings of Jewish books by the Catholic Church.12 He must have  known about the Jesuit campaign to burn Jewish books; in fact, his call  for the incineration of the Prague Talmud can be seen as a call to con- tinue the policy initiated by the church 12 years earlier. He might have  been aware that some of the main actors of the book-burning cam- paign of the 1710s were the same “high sages of the Jesuit order” who  provided backing for the 1720s publications. Yet he believed that the  risk of another Christian campaign against Jewish books was worth tak- ing and that the publishers would be responsible for any negative  developments. Hagiz’s call to burn the Talmud is so unusual that we must con- sider the motivations that drove him to make it. As already noted, he  claimed in his letter to Zelig to have received a list of the changes to  the text of the aggadot but gave no specific examples of such changes.  However, he made it clear that the issue at hand was no ordinary   censorship—after all, most early modern editions of the Talmud, the  prayer book, and biblical commentaries were censored, yet rabbis did  not normally call for their destruction. According to Hagiz, those re- sponsible for the Prague printings had not simply followed the patterns  established by earlier censors but implemented a completely new,  </page> <page sequence="5"> systematic censorial policy, “adding and removing [passages] on the  basis of false arguments [supporting their actions].”13 This policy was  said to be explicitly formulated by the editors in a written “apology” [151] [hitnatselut]. (Such an apology was indeed written; see the discussion  below.) Three times in the body of the letter, Hagiz mentioned that The Rabbi and  the Prague publishers went beyond the normal practice of Christian the Jesuit censorship of Hebrew books: in addition to the elimination of alleg- • edly offensive sections of the Talmud, prayer book, and biblical com- Paweł  Maciejko mentaries, they augmented the established texts with novel passages of  their own invention. This, in Hagiz’s view, was much worse than the  typical expurgations: it led to the creation of an entirely new text,  bearing a familiar title and ostensibly resembling a canonical work of  Jewish tradition but in fact carrying a message alien and hostile to  Judaism.  The Actors behind the Prague Publications In this paper, I will concentrate on the edition of the Talmud; the anal- ysis of the Pentateuch and prayer book will wait for my forthcoming  monograph on Rabbi Jonathan Eibeschütz. I am interested primarily  in the ideological underpinnings of the Prague publication. I believe  that the Prague Talmud was unique not only in the scope of its censo- rial intervention but also in the nature of this intervention. The censo- rial amendments were not the result of a simple application of typical  Catholic policy on the censorship of Jewish books and—more widely— on Jews and Judaism. Rather, they stemmed from a novel theological  position that can be inferred from the text and reconstructed from the  archival material documenting the history of the publication. To some  extent, this theological position was shared by both Jews and Christians  involved in the enterprise. At the same time, each party had its own  agenda that it tried to push through regardless of, or even despite, the  stance of its counterpart. In his discussion of the Prague Talmud, Hagiz presented the edition  as one that followed the Christian tradition, yet he emphasized that it  was not imposed on the Jews by Christians. Rather, he attributed the  appearance of the Prague publications to the “plotting” of local Jews or  a single Jew (near the middle of Hagiz’s letter to Zelig the plural forms  suddenly become singular) who “secretly lay in waiting” and “outwardly  exhibited a pure and worthy soul, hiding their wickedness behind it.”14  Hagiz saw the edition as a product of a collaboration between the  “sages of the Jesuit order” and “certain individuals” from the Jewish  </page> <page sequence="6"> community; it was the latter who took the initiative to print the edition  and who were mainly to blame for its terrible consequences. These in- [152] dividuals remained unnamed in the body of the letter. However, the  missive is replete with hints concerning their identities. For instance,  Jewish Hagiz mentioned that the initiators of the edition “had been recently  Social excommunicated by the rabbinic courts of Frankfurt am Main and the  Studies Triple Community of Altona Hamburg, and Wandsbeck”—an unmis- • takable reference to the bans of excommunication against Eibeschütz’s  Vol. 20 No. 2 Va-avo ha-yom el ha-‘ayin that were issued in the summer of 1725 by the  batei din (rabbinical courts) of Frankfurt and Altona-Hamburg-Wans- beck.15 In another section of the letter, Hagiz stated that his aim was to  “[reveal] who it is that brought this evil upon us [Jonah 1:8]” and called  on the rabbis to “isolate him like Sheba son of Bichri, who joined the  villains saying, ‘We have no share in David’ [2 Samuel 20:1].”16 In the  first of these statements, Hagiz placed a gershayim, the Hebrew sign in- dicating abbreviation, on the word mi (who), thereby suggesting that it  should be read as an acronym for morenu Yehonatan (our teacher, Jona- than); the reference to Sheba’s rebellion against King David is an allu- sion to the “rebellion” of Eibeschütz against the titular “prince of the  Land of Israel” (nasi Erets Yisrael), David Oppenheim (1664–1736), the  chief rabbi of Prague.17 Hagiz’s letter to Zelig does not contain any hints regarding the  identity of “the high sages of the Jesuit order” who were behind the  publication of the Talmud. Among the documents from the 1720s  and 1730s included in Gahalei esh, the letter is the only document that  touches upon the Prague editions. However, the third volume of Ga- halei esh (containing material from the mid-1750s) ends with a pam- phlet listing 115 specific accusations against Eibeschütz. The  introduction to the pamphlet reads as follows: All that appears in the following pamphlet is nothing other than the  [testimony to] the opposition that existed against him [Eibeschütz]  from the day he arrived in Altona [September 16, 175018], because of his  previous misdeeds. These began with the malicious crimes that he com- mitted in Prague against the famed rabbi, prince of the Land of Is- rael . . . Rabbi David Oppenheim of blessed memory. . . . All this became  public when he tried to print the Babylonian Talmud in Prague with  great expurgations and omitting [many] passages. He even managed to  print a few tractates, and he did all this with the assistance of the priest  Hazil Poyer, for whom he cherished a great friendship.19 The real name of “the priest Hazil Poyer” was Father Franciscus  Haselbauer, a Jesuit professor of Hebrew at the Prague Clementinum.  </page> <page sequence="7"> Haselbauer published a textbook of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish  grammar,20 a Hebrew-Aramaic-Latin lexicon,21 an edition of the Gos- pels in German written in Hebrew characters,22 and two books, in the [153] same language, devoted to the exposition of Christian doctrine for  Jews.23 Beginning in 1711, he served as the censor of Hebrew books in The Rabbi and  Prague and was one of three priests responsible for the house searches the Jesuit and confiscations of uncensored Jewish books.24 He was also the insti- • gator of the book burnings that took place in the city. Paweł  Maciejko In order to understand the circumstances of the publication of the  Prague Talmud, we must briefly discuss its historical backdrop. The  idea of publishing the Talmud in Bohemia first arose in the wake of the  publication of the Frankfurt an der Oder edition of the work. That edi- tion appeared in two printings, in 1697–99 and in 1715; the second  printing prominently featured the privileges of Leopold I, Joseph I,  and Charles VI. The apparent support of the Holy Roman emperors for  the printing of the Talmud complicated the legal justification for both  the publication of the talmudic corpus by the Jews and its censorship,  banning, or confiscation by the Catholic Church. The Prague Jesuits’  campaign, during which copies of the Frankfurt edition were seized  and burned, made the problem acute: were the priests destroying a  book that had been condemned to burning by Pope Clement VIII or  one whose printing had been allowed by Emperor Charles VI? Was it at  all possible that the Most Catholic Majesty truly permitted the publica- tion of a work that had been denounced by the popes and placed by the  Inquisition on the Index of Prohibited Books?  These questions created a legal quandary, which the elders of the  Prague Jewish community attempted to use when they petitioned the  archbishop’s consistory court on March 11, 1726.25 They brought to the  court’s attention that a “corrected edition of the Talmud” bearing the  privileges of the Holy Roman emperors had recently been printed and  was now being distributed in numerous cities throughout the empire.  However, they reported, the local censor of Hebrew books, Father  Haselbauer, was not allowing the import of the edition to Prague,  claiming that the censorship it had undergone had not been thorough  enough and that many controversial passages remained therein. On  the basis of the three imperial privileges appended to their petition,  the elders requested the court’s permission to print the Babylonian Tal- mud in Prague, stating that if the work still contained any problematic  passages, the court should implore the censor of Jewish books to cor- rect them. Given that the emperors had already allowed the printing of  the Talmud, they said, such “corrections” would remove any remaining  obstacles against having it printed in the imperial city of Prague. </page> <page sequence="8"> Haselbauer responded on April 4, 1726.26 His answer consisted of a  cover letter and an appendix. In the appendix, a German document  [154] penned in Haselbauer’s hand and titled “Catholisches Gutachten über  die Basler und Franckfurter Talmud,”27 the censor claimed to have ex- Jewish amined both the older Basel and the recent Frankfurt versions of the  Social Talmud, determining that the title pages of both indeed bore the in- Studies scription ab omnibus iis quae contra Religionem Christianam sunt, juxta men- • tem Concilii Tridentinum expurgatum (purged of all that is contrary to the  Vol. 20 No. 2 Christian religion according to the understanding of the Council of  Trent). However, according to Haselbauer, the inscription in the Basel  edition was clearly added after the printing: the Talmud was placed on  the Roman Index of Prohibited Books in 1591, during the revision of  the index compiled during the Council of Trent, whereas the Basel  printing was completed around 1581.28 In any case, the printing press  was set up in a heretical city unlikely to implement the papal laws faith- fully. And even if the Basel Talmud did conform to the guidelines for- mulated by the Council of Trent, Clement VIII’s bull explicitly  prohibiting the printing of the Talmud had been issued after it was  published and therefore nullified earlier, more permissive regulations.  As for the Frankfurt edition, it also bore the stamp cum privilegio sacrae  Caesaro [sic] Majestatis (with the privilege of the Holy Roman Emperor).  Yet according to Haselbauer, the imperial privilege could not protect  “Jews and non-Catholics” because they obtained it by pretending that  the Talmud had been properly censored, whereas clearly it had not.  The Frankfurt printers, he stated, had committed a double fraud: Jo- seph I’s privilege of 1710 contained an explicit stipulation that books  not contain any anti-Christian contents, which they did, and the privi- lege was requested on the basis of the claim that the edition had not yet  been printed, which it had. Accordingly, Haselbauer concluded, both  the Basel and the Frankfurt editions were illegal and should be banned  and destroyed everywhere in the empire. Following this general conclusion, Haselbauer’s report noted that  the most obvious blasphemies against Christianity were eliminated in  both the Basel and the Frankfurt editions of the Talmud. The censor- ship was insufficient, however: in most cases it consisted of merely re- moving single words. In the Frankfurt edition the printers left blank  spaces for the reinsertion of the removed words, and in both editions  entire passages containing illicit content were left intact. Haselbauer  claimed to have noted over one thousand passages “partly blasphe- mous, partly against the Holy Scripture, partly against reason.”29 The  report concluded: “There is no reason to presume that His Imperial  Majesty, the supreme protector of the Catholic Church, meant to  </page> <page sequence="9"> approve in his imperial rescript a book that had been banned and  deemed as deserving destruction [by the church].”30 Haselbauer’s April 4 letter to the Prague consistory, with its appen- [155] dix, proposed a solution to the contradiction between the papal ban  and the imperial privilege: the book condemned by Pope Clement VIII The Rabbi and  and the book permitted by Emperor Charles VI were simply not the the Jesuit same book. The emperor’s privilege was a binding law, but it had been • used fraudulently by the Basel and Frankfurt printers, who had in- Paweł  Maciejko voked it in order to publish a Talmud that did not conform to the privi- lege as intended by the ruler. The emperor had allowed the printing of  the Talmud, but only on condition that it undergo a thorough Catholic  censorship, which was not implemented either in Basel or in Frankfurt.  Further, the Council of Trent had never banned the Talmud outright;  the intention of the cardinals had merely been to prevent the circulation  of “uncorrected” versions of the work. In both cases, Haselbauer went  beyond the letter of the law and interpreted the intent of the legisla- tors. He discovered that the will of the popes was in full agreement  with the imperial will: both the ecclesiastical and the secular au- thority condemned the “uncorrected” Talmud but allowed its print- ing in principle, provided it had been “properly corrected.” Haselbauer’s proposed solution had two important ramifications.  First, the priest argued that despite their invocation of the Council of  Trent and the emperor on the title pages, the Basel and Frankfurt  editions of the Talmud in fact contravened both the laws of the  church and the laws of the empire and were therefore deserving of  absolute condemnation. This tacitly legitimized the actions of the Je- suits who had been burning these editions in Prague.  Second, Haselbauer’s argumentation opened the way to accede to  the Jewish elders’ request to publish the Talmud in Prague, which  hinged on the work’s “proper” correction. The censor’s understanding  of the word proper in this context may also be reconstructed from the  appendix to his letter. In his opinion, the censorship of the Basel and  Frankfurt printings was improper not only because it was not thorough  enough but also because it had applied an entirely erroneous pattern of  censorial practice. The censors had removed single words or sentences,  leaving larger passages unchanged. The proper censorship would pre- sumably correct semantic units larger than a sentence, removing or re- writing entire sections to fit the meaning of the censor. Moreover, the  proper correction should leave no traces; for instance, it would never  leave blank spaces, allowing the reader to guess what the uncensored  text was. Further, to preclude any appearance that its publication con- tradicted the papal ban and to avoid scandalizing the Christian public,  </page> <page sequence="10"> the properly corrected Talmud should be given a different title.31 In  some sense, it should be an entirely novel work. Finally, the proper cen- [156] sorship should have more than just the negative function of thoroughly  removing any illicit content. It should also perform the positive func- Jewish tion of accentuating (and, if needed, appropriately rewriting) the frag- Social ments of the Talmud that demonstrate the truth of Christianity to the  Studies Jews and subvert the authority of rabbinic Judaism. The aim was not  • only to remove an anti-Christian book from Jewish hands; it was to give  Vol. 20 No. 2 the Jews a book that was, subtly but unmistakably, pro-Christian. The printing of a full edition of the Babylonian Talmud in Frank- furt on the basis of an imperial privilege was seen by the elders of the  Jewish community of Prague as an opportunity to have the most impor- tant work of Jewish learning published in their city. They understood  that the price of publication of such an edition would be their agree- ment to extended censorship, and their initial petition to the consistory  indicated their readiness to submit their edition to corrections even  more far-reaching than those implemented in Frankfurt. In the second  petition, they expressed their willingness to implement the changes to  the text themselves. Haselbauer noted the opportunity as well, express- ing his desire to take advantage of the printing of the Prague Talmud  to put his own novel censorial strategy into operation and to produce a  work serving his missionary purposes. The two parties had different  goals but shared an interest in seeing the Talmud printed in Bohemia.  It is not certain whether the elders imagined the scope of the changes  envisioned by Haselbauer or whether the censor had already informed  them of the particulars of his proposal at this early stage. But it is clear  that they were, for the time being, fellow travelers.  The Collaboration between Father Haselbauer and   the Jewish Community Collaboration, however, was not easy. On April 12, 1726, Father Hasel- bauer sent a letter to the consistory, framed as a response to the court’s  request for a written affidavit attesting that he would “dare to purge  and correct the text of the Talmud to the extent that it appropriately  conforms to the Constitution [of the Council of Trent] and the Bull of  Clement VIII, so its new printing can be allowed.”32 The Jesuit wrote: I humbly respond and declare that I would dare to expurgate and cor- rect the contents of the Talmud according to the usual mode of censor- ship, so that there only remain those matters that contain customs and  </page> <page sequence="11"> laws of the Old Testament, as well as beautiful moral teachings befitting  all of human society. All other matters, not only those containing slurs  and vilifications against the Christian religion, which sometimes appear [157] in the Talmud, but also those containing contrived ideas of God or blas- phemies and libelous [opinions] about the saintly people of the Old Dis- The Rabbi and  pensation, naturally must be removed. Further, there must be removed the Jesuit all content that twists the [true] meaning of the Holy Scripture and sug- • gests interpretations perverted and absurd, those that give the impres- Paweł  sion of rabbinic fantasies and all similar [matters]. If all blasphemies Maciejko and slanders distorting [the meaning of] the Scriptures were thoroughly  removed and there remained only customs and Jewish laws, as well as  sound moral teachings, I see no reason why [the printing of the Tal- mud] should violate the papal ban: Clement VIII’s bull against wicked  Hebrew writings and books condemns and prohibits totally ungodly tal- mudic, kabbalistic, and other villainous books. Yet the moral and cere- monial content [that would remain in the censored Talmud] would be  neither kabbalistic, nor ungodly, nor villainous; Jews everywhere are al- lowed to practice them freely.33 By “the usual mode of censorship” (consueto censurae modo), Hasel- bauer meant that the “Jews themselves would remove everything that  should be removed and correct every book according to the rules they  had received. Then they would present to him for censoring the book  together with the corrigenda.”34 He would subsequently check every- thing himself.  Haselbauer’s usual mode of censorship was, by historical standards,  completely unusual. To be sure, it was commonplace for Jewish con- verts to Christianity to assist censors of Hebrew books or even to serve  as censors themselves (some scholars have claimed that the majority of  the censors of Jewish books were in fact Jewish apostates).35 Yet the situ- ation in Bohemia was anomalous by any standard. Following the unsu- pervised 1710 publication of an unexpurgated prayer book, the  enraged Emperor Joseph I had issued, in early July of that year, an edict  demanding that “in the future, before a Jewish book goes to print, it  shall be submitted to the chief rabbi [of Prague]. From him it will be  passed over to the consistory for censorship, together with his state- ment that it contains nothing forbidden (for which he will bear the sole  responsibility).”36 Its harsh character notwithstanding, the edict re- mained a dead letter for five years: the chief rabbi of Prague, David Op- penheim, did not assume any censorial functions and the extant  sources do not mention any efforts made to put the imperial order into  practice. The censorship of Jewish books continued to be performed  solely by the Jesuits. This situation changed suddenly in 1715, when  </page> <page sequence="12"> some unknown actor among the secular or ecclesiastical authorities  began demanding the enforcement of the edict, putting pressure on  [158] Oppenheim to undertake the duties of censor. The chief rabbi re- sponded by composing a supplication against the imperial decree, ar- Jewish guing that tasking him with the censorship of every Jewish book to be  Social published in Bohemia would leave him with no time to perform his  Studies regular rabbinic duties. Moreover, he argued, many Hebrew texts were  • open to interpretation; should he approve a book based on his own in- Vol. 20 No. 2 terpretation, which might then be rejected by the consistory based on a  reading proposed by Catholic theologians, he would be placing him- self in jeopardy for having authorized a heretical work. He called on  the emperor to continue the standard practice of having Hebrew books  censored only by the Jesuits and emphasized that the priests themselves  had never demanded his participation in the censorship.37 Indeed, ac- cording to the rabbi, the Jesuits even supported his plea to be excused  from it.38 Within three days of receiving the supplication, Charles rejected it  and demanded that the rabbi immediately assume his duties.39 Op- penheim responded with yet another plea, repeating his earlier argu- ments and adding,  Never, since the Jews have lived in the kingdom of Bohemia, was the  censorship of books assigned to a chief rabbi. Never, in any country in  which there are Jewish print shops, was such a strict censorship assigned  to a Jew, let alone a chief rabbi, since it is clear to everyone that it is im- possible to fulfill [the censorial] and rabbinic duties at the same time.40  The point that eventually excused Oppenheim, however, was his  statement that after 27 years of serving as a rabbi, “the strength of his  body and mind [had] diminished.”41 In particular, the chief rabbi  claimed to be gradually losing his eyesight. On November 26, 1716,  Charles excused Oppenheim from serving as a censor and officially  appointed one Simon Jeitless, a member of the Prague Jewish com- munity, to perform the “precensorship” (Vor-Censur) of Jewish books.  The arrangement was supposed to remain in place for as long as Op- penheim was alive; after his death, precensorship duties were to be  taken up by his successor.42  Charles’s ruling formally established the office of the Jewish pre- censor in Prague. The precensor, funded by the Jewish community,  was to execute the initial screening of all Hebrew and Yiddish books  to be published in Bohemia and Moravia,43 along with those exported  from other countries; to eliminate those found on papal indices; and  to execute preliminary expurgations of the most obviously illicit  </page> <page sequence="13"> content. The second round of censorship would be performed by  Haselbauer, acting on behalf of the archbishop’s consistory. Follow- ing his appointment to the position of precensor, Jeitless began regu- [159] larly collaborating with Haselbauer. The usual modus operandi was  for Jeitless to check proofs and approve them for preprinting. The pub- The Rabbi and  lication was subsequently printed in one or two copies and checked by the Jesuit Haselbauer, who would then approve the entire print run. The final • printing was checked again to make sure that all the interventions of Paweł  Maciejko the censors had been carried out faithfully. A copy of each publication  was to be deposited at the consistory and was to be used as a master  copy for future reprints. Several months after the precensor’s appointment, Haselbauer re- ported that “[the writings of] six authors have already been corrected  and others are in the process of being corrected by the Jew Simon Jeit- less, acting instead of the dull-witted rabbi, and then by the archbish- op’s censor [prius a Judaeo Simone Jaisteles [sic] loco Rabbini incapacis, dein  ab ArchiEpiscopali Censore].”44 In October 1717, Jeitless submitted to the  imperial appellate court a document specifying “how far [he] could  allow himself, as a Jew, to perform such a precensorship” (wie weith ich  mich wegen sothaner vor Censur alß ein Judt einlassen könne).45 He stated  that although he had pursued rabbinical studies in his youth, for the  past 30 years he had engaged primarily in business and “had no com- plete knowledge of all the controversies and differences between the  Hebrews.”46 Accordingly, he was prepared to perform only the prelimi- nary task of erasing obviously anti-Christian content. He emphasized  his good working relationship with Haselbauer and declared himself  willing to address any objections the Jesuit might have and to work to- gether with him to solve any misunderstandings.47 However, he categor- ically rejected three demands that might be imposed upon him:  censoring passages that had nothing to do with Christianity, rewriting  (and not merely erasing) objectionable passages, and tasking him with  postprint censorship and therefore with responsibility for the final  product of the print shop. We do not know if Haselbauer (or some other  Christian party) made such demands or if Jeitless was merely trying to  preempt excessive demands and define the limits of his collaboration  with the church. Yet it seems that during the 10 years that followed his  appointment, the precensor was never called upon to cross the bound- aries he himself had defined. Jeitless censored every Hebrew and Yid- dish publication that appeared in Prague between 1717 and 1726, and  his involvement in the printing of the Talmud in that city was seen as a  matter of course. The initial request of the elders of the Jewish commu- nity to allow the printing (dated March 11, 1726) contains a clause that  </page> <page sequence="14"> the first round of censorship should be carried out, as usual, by Jeitless;  petitions composed later in March and in April of that year also con- [160] tain his signature as one of the initiators of the edition.  At some point between April and September of 1726, however, the  Jewish Jeitless-Haselbauer collaboration began to go awry. As the idea of  Social publishing the Talmud in Prague was slowly gaining currency, Hasel- Studies bauer composed a brief memo entitled “Cynosur und Haubt Regeln  • welche in corrigirung des Talmuds sollen vom Jüdischen vor-Censor  Vol. 20 No. 2 accurat beobachtet werden.” 48 The Jesuit formulated eight principles  to be followed by the precensor: removal of all aggadot mentioning  or alluding to Jesus and his disciples; removal of all blasphemies and  insults against Christianity and the Roman Empire; removal of all  teachings offensive to public morality; removal of all talmudic de- scriptions of miracles, or anything that could be mistakenly inter- preted as a miracle; removal of all locutions that interpret the Holy  Scriptures in a kabbalistic or otherwise irrational manner; removal  of all talmudic “fables” that present the holy men of the Old Testa- ment in detrimental fashion; removal of all unseemly metaphors con- cerning God; and removal of all teachings based on the doctrine of  metempsychosis. Haselbauer’s memo, together with his affidavit of  April 12, 1726, to the archbishop’s consistory court, constituted a  blueprint for the censorship of the Prague edition of the Talmud. In  the affidavit, the priest defined the task of the censor as expurgare et  corrigire: in addition to the expurgation of illicit content, the censor  should propose the “correct” reading.  Haselbauer’s censorial program was radical in comparison to ear- lier examples of censorship of Jewish books, not only in other countries  but also in Prague itself. The 1726 proposal crossed two of Jeitless’s  three red lines: censorship was to be imposed on passages that had  no anti-Christian intent and was to include rewriting (and not merely  expurgating) the accepted text. As a result, the collaboration be- tween Jeitless and Haselbauer turned sour. The watershed was Octo- ber 11, 1726, when Haselbauer submitted a full Latin report on  tractate Berakhot to the consistory. He wrote: I most humbly inform that the first book or treatise of the Talmud,  called Berakhot, has been completely censored. Following the request of  the honorable office [the consistory court], I composed an extract list- ing the verses that should be removed or changed; the verses have been  marked with the sign of the cross as is indicated in appendix A. Since  the Jews want to put forward explanations of obscure and apparently  fabulous things, while I, on the basis of my own authority, do not want to  include them, I suggest that the honorable consistory should examine  </page> <page sequence="15"> the elders in my presence and, following the examination of both sides,  make the final decision in this matter.49 [161] A copy of Haselbauer’s expert testimony was also sent to the Jewish  elders, who reacted on the same day by sending a petition aimed at The Rabbi and  countering the censor’s report. The elders said that they had received the Jesuit “[a] Latin report in which he [Haselbauer] indicated that he intends • not only to correct and improve [corrigiren und verbessern] the seemingly Paweł  suspicious points that are against the Christian religion or injure Chris- Maciejko tendom, but also . . . those that are in his opinion legendary or suggest  inappropriate understandings of the Holy Scriptures.”50 They asked  the court to limit the scope of the proposed changes and presented five  points for the court’s consideration. First, they argued, even if the items  censored by Haselbauer had indeed been legendary (which claim they  adamantly rejected), those items could not lead to an inappropriate un- derstanding of Scripture among Christians, for “the Talmud is printed  only for Jews, in Hebrew, and not in any Christian language.”51 Second,  the Jewish elders asked the consistory and the censor not to agree with  the text of the Talmud but merely to tolerate it, exactly as the Jews in  general were tolerated by Christian authorities, despite the fact that the  latter do not agree with all tenets of Judaism. Third, they noted that “no  reasonable Jewish [reader] would ever take the legendary or—we  should rather say—obscure [fabulose oder viellmehr duncklen] points liter- ally [dem Buchstaben nach], especially given that the most famous rab- binic authorities had always interpreted them in an allegorical  fashion.”52 Fourth, if the questionable items were completely expur- gated, no Jew would purchase a copy of the Talmud thus bowdlerized.  Fifth, Jews in other countries would deem the Prague elders evildoers if  they dared to “shamefully destroy [schimpfflich zu vernichten] the book  that is 1,500 years old.”53 On the basis of these arguments, the elders  asked the consistory to intervene and mitigate the censorial changes  implemented by Haselbauer. At this moment, Rabbi Jonathan Eibe- schütz entered the fray. Rabbi Jonathan Eibeschütz’s Involvement in the  Publication of the Prague Talmud Haselbauer’s appendix A to his October 11, 1726 letter, an “extract list- ing the verses [of the tractate Berakhot] that should be removed or  changed,” was probably the same as the “writ listing what should be  added and what removed from the [talmudic] aggadot” mentioned by  </page> <page sequence="16"> Hagiz in his letter to Zelig. However, I did not find any such document  during my research in Prague. Oddly, the archives contain very few  [162] sources pertaining to the censorship of Hebrew books between Octo- ber 1726, when Haselbauer demanded a confrontation with the Jewish  Jewish elders, and the early 1740s, when Eibeschütz left the city; this is in  Social marked contrast to both the preceding and the following periods.  Studies None of the extant documents mention Eibeschütz by name.54 The  • only archival document explicitly mentioning his involvement in the  Vol. 20 No. 2 censorship of the Talmud is housed not in Prague but in Schleswig. In  1752, Eibeschütz’s detractors filed a case against him at the royal court  of Denmark. Eibeschütz lost the first round of the case; when prepar- ing an appeal, he requested letters of recommendation on his behalf  from important Christians he had known in the past. One such letter  was written on June 1, 1753, by one of his oldest Christian friends and  supporters, the septuagenarian Father Haselbauer. The Jesuit wrote: I hereby attest that Jonathan Eibeschütz, the current chief rabbi of Al- tona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck, resided here [in Prague] for more than  twenty years and was always honest with us. He faithfully served his con- gregation, industriously studied Jewish arts, dutifully served as a chief  rabbi, and was appointed by his imperial and royal majesty as a precensor  of the Hebrew printed books. In this capacity, we professors were in daily  contact with him and we can say about him nothing but fame-worthy and  good things. When he moved to Metz in 1742, all the people here were  displeased and wished he could have stayed in Prague.55  Haselbauer’s testimony is the only period document I have found that  explicitly states that Eibeschütz was a precensor of Hebrew books in  Prague. Yet Eibeschütz’s own works contain a statement concerning the  printing of the Talmud. In the introduction to his halakhic magnum  opus, Kereti u-feleti (Cherethites and Pelethites; see 2 Samuel 15:18), one  of only two works he published in his lifetime, Eibeschütz wrote: And I entered . . . into the courts of the gracious lords and priests of the  Christians to dispute with them for the sake of our Torah. For the lords  ridiculed several things, . . . and they slandered us, and I was as a de- fender who clarifies the difficulties in the words of the ancient sages,  and “my wisdom was established going forth as sure as the morning”  [Hosea 6:3]; and I was vindicated and was given permission to print the  books of the Talmud, which was never granted before.56 The most important aspect of Eibeschütz’s account for this discus- sion is his statement that permission to print the Talmud was granted  </page> <page sequence="17"> to him after disputations with Christian priests, which took place at  their “courts”; during these disputations, Eibeschütz explained to the  priests the difficulties in the words of the ancient sages of Israel. The [163] archival sources discussed in the previous section allow us to fit this  particular piece of the puzzle in its proper location. As noted, in Octo- The Rabbi and  ber 1726 a crisis occurred during the meetings between the Jewish el- the Jesuit ders and Haselbauer; in the wake of this crisis, Haselbauer demanded a • cross-examination of the sides by the archbishop’s court, in order to Paweł  Maciejko reach a decision concerning the moot points of the projected edition.  It is likely that the “disputations” in the “court” mentioned in the intro- duction to Kereti u-feleti refer to confrontations between Haselbauer  and Eibeschütz before the archbishop’s consistory court in Prague. The  inability of the Jewish elders to resolve their disagreements with Hasel- bauer led the community to select someone else for the debates with  the Jesuit. This person would have needed to be a first-rate rabbinic  scholar, able to discuss the finer points of Gemarah in a fashion that  would convince the antagonistic yet clever and learned Christian dispu- tant. Eibeschütz’s statement that he was granted permission to print  the Talmud following his disputations with the Christian priests, read  together with the archival sources from the Prague consistory suggest  that the task was taken up by the latter and that he took over Jeitless’s  place as a representative of the Jews during the debates over the final  shape of the Prague edition of Berakhot.  The introduction to Kereti u-feleti was quoted by Graetz and by  Rabinowicz as evidence for Eibeschütz’s position as a censor of He- brew books. Yet, characteristically, Eibeschütz took credit in this in- troduction for gaining permission to print the Talmud without  mentioning its censorship. Only when read in tandem with other con- temporary testimonies does the introduction suggest that the Prague  Talmud was different from other contemporary Talmuds and that  Eibeschütz was involved in shaping it.  The introduction to Kereti u-feleti is the only place in a work pub- lished under his name in which Eibeschütz mentions his involvement  in the publication of the Prague Talmud. Before turning to a discus- sion of specific locutions in the Prague edition, however, I must add  one more stone to the mosaic I am piecing together. As noted, in his  letter to Zelig, Hagiz mentioned that the Jewish editors of the Prague  Berakhot had composed a written apology (hitnatselut) that contained  “false arguments” aiming to justify their approach to censorship. In  1877, Rafael Kirchheim published a text entitled “Apology and An- swer of the Rabbis of Prague for the Expurgated Printing of the Tal- mud in the Year 5487” in several installments in the first Hebrew  </page> <page sequence="18"> weekly newspaper, Ha-maggid.57 Kirchheim claimed to have found  this anonymous document in the archives of the Prague Jewish com- [164] munity. Its avowed purpose was to explain to “all the sages of Israel  serving in [rabbinic] courts”58 how the rabbis of Prague had obtained  Jewish permission to print the Talmud, “adding on the margins commentar- Social ies explaining bizarre aggadot, as well as replacing some content with  Studies synonymous expressions.”59 The author of the apology gives a brief  • history of the Christian campaign against Jewish books and mentions  Vol. 20 No. 2 house searches and the confiscation of Jewish books, including the  libraries of several rabbis. The Jesuit priests, who knew the Hebrew  language, compiled a list of anti-Christian locutions in Jewish books,  on the basis of Johann Andreas Eisenmenger’s Entdecktes Judenthum.  The list was deposited at the archbishop’s consistory court and with  the representatives of the monarchy; following the outrage caused  among Christians by the “revelation” of Jewish “blasphemies,” the  emperor demanded that all Jewish books in Bohemia be confiscated.  On hearing this, the rabbis of Prague “were frightened that it would  become law and that the second [punishment] would be harder than  the first [see b. Soferim 15].”60 They considered all legal means of find- ing a solution to the quandary: Thus we followed the old practice established by our predecessors of  blessed memory [geoneinu kadmoneinu z"l] when they sought the right  to revise the Talmud and did not succeed. And we thought that maybe  something [good] might come out of this distress and anguish [Prov- erbs 1:27], we [understood] that it would be a great deliverance for the  Talmud and all of its commentators. And we strived in our souls, with  great effort and enormous diligence, for the matter was discussed with  the Jesuits who check the books for the consistory and appellate courts.  Then, the consistory [approached] Father Haselbauer, the Jesuit who  has Jewish books under his jurisdiction, with the question if we can be  allowed to revise the Talmud so that it conforms to the papal prohibi- tion. This can be seen from the copies of their [the elders’] letter and  [Haselbauer’s] answer to it. We got his answer and we obtained permis- sion to print [the Talmud], but on condition that the Christian priests,  the aforementioned Jesuits, will first edit it [to make sure that] it con- tains nothing against them, for there is a royal ruling about all the  books that are being printed here, be it Jewish or Christian, that they  cannot be printed without the Jesuit first censoring [yagihu] them. The  judges of the appellate court agreed to it too. It was a time of joy and  gladness [Esther 8:17], of [the fulfillment] of the commandment for the  Jews of our city, for it was a great thing that the Talmud and all its com- mentators would be openly available to all the nations; this was never  allowed before by the Christian priests. . . . So we chose people from our  </page> <page sequence="19"> community, from among the scholars who had the skills to stand in the  courts of the Christians, for a disputation and discussion about the  words of the sages. They were to debate with the Jesuits the nature of [165] the censorship and to interpret the words of the sages in the court.61 The Rabbi and  During the disputation, the priests quoted Eisenmenger and other the Jesuit Christian anti-Jewish books and ridiculed various rabbinic parables. • Yet the representatives of the Jewish community had a deeper mas- Paweł  tery of the aggadot and bizarre derashot (moral sermons) of the Tal- Maciejko mud. They managed to clarify the moot points and explain the  ostensible absurdities of the talmudic discourse; eventually they won  the disputation on most points.  After permission to print the Talmud was assured in principle, the  leaders of the community were given a list of concrete alterations of the  text demanded by the priests (again, this “list” was likely Haselbauer’s  appendix A and Hagiz’s “writ listing what should be added and what  removed from the [talmudic] aggadot”). The author of the apology  claims to have been given this list by the Jewish elders and asked to pro- vide an expert opinion on both the specific changes and the general  policy of censoring or altering sacred texts. He argued that although  every word of Jewish religious writings is holy and belongs to the tradi- tion passed on from generation to generation, there are four different  types of content dispersed in the text of the Talmud. First, there is the  law of Moses as given at Mount Sinai. Second, there are laws and their  practical applications derived from the former on the basis of the 13  hermeneutical principles (middot) established by Rabbi Ishmael. Third,  there are the homilies and moral sermons (derashot) of the sages. Fi- nally, there are talmudic legends (aggadot) containing esoteric con- tent. The contents belonging to the first two categories must be  transmitted as they are, without any censorship, editorial changes, or  alterations. Jewish authors had already edited and abridged the homi- letic material (the third category) in the past, as witnessed in the com- pilations of the sayings of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai62 or the ‘Eyn  Ya‘akov (The Eye of Jacob) anthology. This approach set a precedent for  their further editing. As for the fourth category, as Maimonides had  demonstrated in his Guide for the Perplexed, the contents belonging to it  have an inner, allegorical meaning. Since this true inner sense is di- vorced from external form, these passages can be freely rewritten, pro- vided that the rewriting preserves the gist of the allegory. Now, the  Jesuits’ list of problematic locutions in the talmudic text, according to  the author of the apology, contained only contents belonging to the  last two categories; there was no prima facie reason why the elders of  </page> <page sequence="20"> the Prague community should not accept the demands of the priests.  Indeed, according to the author of the apology, the elders had a duty to  [166] accede to these demands. Obtaining permission for an edition of the  Talmud authorized by the church would be an unprecedented event  Jewish that would create a unique opportunity to have the text printed and  Social “available to all the peoples of the world.”63  Studies Rafael Kirchheim claimed to have found the manuscript of the  • apology among the papers of the Prague Jewish community. This  Vol. 20 No. 2 claim appears legitimate and the document authentic. It is apparent  that its author was intimately familiar with the history of censorship  of the Talmud in general and the controversy about its printing in  Prague in particular. Numerous details of the account are corrobo- rated by archival material from the Prague consistory but are unmen- tioned in any printed source. The content of the document, too, fits  the description of the apology in Hagiz’s letter to Zelig quite well.  Because the anonymous author identified himself as a pupil of Rabbi  Avraham Broda, Kirchheim surmised that the text was composed by  Eibeschütz. This intuition is strengthened by noting certain turns of  phrase, such as statements about the priests “ridiculing the rabbinic  sayings” or the author’s insistence that the church had “never before”  allowed the printing of the Talmud, that appear in almost identical  form in the introduction to Kereti u-feleti. Indeed, I believe that the  two texts should be read together. Read in tandem, not only do both  documents confirm that Eibeschütz was responsible for censoring  the Prague edition of tractate Berakhot, but they also formulate his  views on censorship of the Talmud and of Jewish texts in general. The Comprehensive Model of Censorship In his book The Censor, the Editor, and the Text, Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin  has proposed a view that sees Christian censorship of Hebrew books in  the early modern period “not only as an agent that denies knowledge,  but as a constructive factor.”64 He has developed this view along two  main trajectories. First, he argues that the work of the censor should  not be viewed separately from the tasks of other agents of book produc- tion, such as the editor, the proofreader, the commentator, and the  printer. Early modern censorship did not simply remove certain con- tentious material from the final and previously established text. Rather,  it was one of several factors that, working in parallel, contributed to the  shaping of the text. The central works of the early modern literary  canon were not subjects of censorial activity but its products:  </page> <page sequence="21"> We can consider censorship as a kind of commentary, even if it left vio- lent marks on the text. . . . In many cases, the same person did the edit- ing and the expurgation; gradually, the principles of censorship were [167] incorporated into the editing process, whether by following explicit di- rectives of the censor or by applying directives that had previously been The Rabbi and  internalized.65 the Jesuit • Second, according to Raz-Krakotzkin, the censorship of Hebrew books Paweł  was part and parcel of a wider historical process that “redefined the Maciejko Jewish community as a community within Europe” and replaced the  dichotomy between Jew and Christian with a “radically different per- ception embodied in the phrase ‘Judeo-Christian civilization.’”66 In  other words, censoring Jewish books was in no way a privileged or iso- lated activity; it was an element of the integration of Jewish literature  into the world of European literature,67 creating a body of recognized  knowledge permitted to both Jews and Christians,68 or even a “civiliz- ing process” that formed the modern European consciousness.69 Raz-Krakotzkin’s fascinating book illustrates the triumph of his- torical imagination over historical evidence: the examples from the  history of censorship of Hebrew books in sixteenth- and seventeenth- century Italy that he adduces are too few, too weak, and too random  to prove his wider points. I wish to make two claims here. First,   Eibeschütz’s edition of tractate Berakhot is the primary (alas, in my  view, also the only) fully fledged example of how early modern cen- sorship indeed created novel texts and how censors adjusted Jewish  texts to contemporary European sensibilities. Eibeschütz’s insistence  that the Talmud should be made “available to the entire world” is the  principal exemplification of Raz-Krakotzkin’s idea that the aim of the  censorship of Hebrew books was to “adapt the text in such a way that  both Jews and Christians could read it.”70 Yet there is a major differ- ence between Raz-Krakotzkin’s convert-censors in post-Renaissance  Italy and Eibeschütz in eighteenth-century Prague: the former were,  at best, unconscious agents of deeper historical processes, whereas  the latter implemented a conscious and consistent censorial (or bet- ter, editorial) policy that was in part explicitly formulated and in part  implicit but discernible. Like Raz-Krakotzkin (but unlike the histori- cal figures he discusses), Eibeschütz believed that there was no final,  fixed, and canonized text of the Talmud; his remark in “Apology and  Answer of the Rabbis of Prague” about the predecessors of blessed  memory should be taken seriously—Eibeschütz put himself in the  shoes of the ancient sages and saw himself not as expurgating but  rather as creating the text of the Talmud. </page> <page sequence="22"> In addition, the Prague edition is—to the best of my knowledge— the only example of what can be termed “comprehensive” censorship of  [168] Hebrew books in the early modern period. Even the most sophisticated  of early modern censors (such as Marco Marini, who, as the appointed  Jewish Catholic censor, was jointly responsible for the Basel edition) did not  Social reveal much consciousness of or any real care for the consistency of the  Studies final product of their work; expurgations and amendments were usu- • ally carried out without any concern for coherent arguments or narra- Vol. 20 No. 2 tives or even the grammar and syntax of the censored texts. Paragraphs  were removed without concern for the effect on subsequent para- graphs. Nouns were replaced with nouns of different gender or num- ber without any adjustment of the gender or number of corresponding  verbs and adjectives; subordinate clauses were removed, leaving crip- pled and meaningless sentences. Most censors made no effort to hide  the traces of their labor, leaving blank spaces in place of erased words  or phrases. In postprinting censorship, it was commonplace to physi- cally cut out or blacken the censored content. In contrast, Eibeschütz  revealed an amazing awareness of the interconnectedness and totality  of the text of the Talmud. Some of his amendments to the text of the  Gemarah were implemented only in order to adjust the entire text to  other, earlier amendments. In at least one case, an expression was re- placed by a synonymous expression so as to harmonize the text of trac- tate Berakhot with the texts of other tractates.71 Changes in the Mishnah  and Gemarah necessitated additional changes in the corresponding  sections of Rashi’s commentary and the Tosefta. Some alterations were  motivated by grammatical or even stylistic concerns. The Prague cen- sors took great pains to smooth and even conceal their interventions in  the text of the Talmud; a reader unfamiliar with the uncensored Tal- mud was not to know that it was a doctored version. In order to show how these two claims manifested in practice and  to reconstruct their theological underpinnings, I turn now to a dis- cussion of the text of tractate Berakhot edited by Haselbauer and Eibe- schütz. Because the Prague printing is based in equal measure on the  1581 Basel and 1715 Frankfurt editions of tractate Berakhot, I shall  focus on those censorial interventions that are attested in the Prague  edition but are absent in either the Basel or the Frankfurt ones. Put- ting aside obvious misprints, there are 191 instances in which the  main body (i.e., the Mishnah and Gemarah) of the Prague edition of  tractate Berakhot differs from these two earlier editions. The amend- ments introduced by the censors can be divided into two main cate- gories, corresponding to Haselbauer’s twofold definition of the task  to the censor, expurgare et corrigire. </page> <page sequence="23"> Editorial Amendments in the Text of the   Prague Berakhot: Expurgations [169] The initial, less complex level of changes implemented by the censors  was the expurgation of illicit contents. These were far more extensive The Rabbi and  than the ones in previous censored editions of the Talmud. The larg- the Jesuit est was the removal of 193 consecutive words from b. Berakhot 6b, thus • eliminating the entire section of the narrative that discussed God Paweł  Maciejko wearing phylacteries. Other prominent examples include the expur- gation of 64 words discussing the preparation of a concoction using  the after-birth of a black cat to allow one to see demons (b. Berakhot  6a) and 58 words from the story of the composition of birkat ha-minim  (the malediction against the heretics) in b. Berakhot 28b–29a. (In the  Basel and Frankfurt editions of the Talmud, this section was cen- sored and the word minim [heretics] replaced by malshinim [slander- ers, informers], but it was not eliminated; in the Prague edition, both  the talmudic text and the corresponding passages in Rashi’s com- mentary were completely expunged.)  In general, the sections targeted for expurgation were those cor- responding to the eight principles formulated in Haselbauer’s “Cyno- sur und Haubt Regeln.” Thus, the Prague censors eliminated the very  small number of actually or allegedly anti-Christian narratives that  had escaped the vigilance of the Basel and Frankfurt censors, such as  the story about a Persian being attacked by a snake in b. Berakhot 62b  or the dream about a donkey being interpreted as a hint of the Mes- siah’s arrival on a donkey in b. Berakhot 56b; sections that might have  seemed indecent or irrational, such as several other interpretations  of dreams in the final, ninth chapter of the tractate; and expressions  of the glory of the Jewish people, such as the blessing to be said upon  seeing the kings of Israel in b. Berakhot 58a.  The most systematic censorship was applied to anthropomorphic  expressions and “unseemly” descriptions of the Divine, including the  above-mentioned description of God wearing phylacteries; God cry- ing (b. Berakhot 59a); Moses taking hold of God “like a man who seizes  his fellow by his garment” (b. Berakhot 32a); and God admitting to  Elijah that he had made a mistake (b. Berakhot 31b–32a). Whether  because of its anthropomorphism or its allusion to the feminine as- pect of the godhead, or possibly because it had been identified as an  expression of satanic instigation by the Hebraist Raimon Martini, the  term bat kol (voice of God) was expurgated throughout the tractate.72  Furthermore, narratives mentioning miracles and unnatural or su- pernatural events were eliminated. Examples include the tale about  </page> <page sequence="24"> Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah’s hair miraculously turning white (b.   Berakhot 28a); an account about a follower of Beit Hillel being eaten  [170] by a lion (b. Berakhot 53b); and a story about a Sadducee becoming a  heap of bones under the gaze of Rabbi Sheshet (b. Berakhot 58a). Sim- Jewish ilarly removed were talmudic contents touching upon the existence  Social of another world, specifically those touching upon the direct inter- Studies vention of otherworldly agents in the affairs of this world. Thus in b.  • Berakhot 50a and 51a, the names of Suriel, the officer of the divine  Vol. 20 No. 2 presence, and of the angel of death were expurgated. This particular  expurgation necessitated extensive rewriting of the entire section  and is a perfect example of the comprehensive character of the  Prague censorship mentioned earlier: because the words spoken by  the angels in the uncensored text of the Talmud now were attributed  to Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the censors had to change the narrative  from the first to the third person and rephrase the sentences formu- lated in direct speech to indirect locutions.  The trend to eliminate talmudic fables about supernatural phe- nomena, events, or personalities expressed itself also in the removal  of two different accounts of the revelation of Elijah, first in the guise  of an Arabian merchant (b. Berakhot 6b) and then in the form of a  man coming to give evidence in a legal case against a Jew who had  had intercourse with an Egyptian woman (b. Berakhot 58a). Also ex- punged were the mentions of the ministering angels (b. Berakhot 61b)  and the heavenly academy (b. Berakhot 18b; in the latter case, Rashi’s  commentary was expunged accordingly). Since the list of changes  Haselbauer demanded is no longer extant, it is impossible to assess  with certainty the respective contributions of the Jesuit and the rabbi.  However, as far as the removal of talmudic contents was concerned, it  seems that Haselbauer’s desires prevailed: all of the eliminated  phrases and sections correspond to the criteria of censorship that he  had formulated. More important, all of the sections that we know  were subjects of debate between Haselbauer and the Jewish elders  were ultimately removed. Eibeschütz was either unwilling or unable  to stand up to Haselbauer on the matter of retaining the sections that  Jeitless and other leaders of the Prague community wanted to retain.  The implementation of the first element of the censorial program  described above, expurgation, fully reflects the Jesuit’s position;  though Eibeschütz might have carried out the actual work, his impact  on the ideological underpinnings of this element was negligible. </page> <page sequence="25"> Editorial Amendments in the Text of the   Prague Berakhot: Corrections [171] Censorship of the Prague Talmud, epitomized by the idea of correc- tion, involved rephrasing the talmudic text or inserting additions The Rabbi and  meant to alter its meaning. This type of correction reveals a pattern of the Jesuit censorship much more sophisticated and complex than that imple- • mented in other premodern Jewish books. Though Haselbauer was re- Paweł  Maciejko sponsible for charting the general direction of this pattern, he was  equally incapable of executing it on his own, because it necessitated  close collaboration with a properly trained Jewish partner. If anywhere,  it is here that we may look for traces of Eibeschütz’s hand. I believe that  Eibeschütz’s contribution to effecting this type of censorship was par- ticularly prominent; but before attempting to assess the size and scope  of this contribution, I shall briefly discuss selected examples of it.  Within the broad category of alterations to the text of the Talmud,  I wish to distinguish two subcategories. The first subcategory encom- passes changes that follow the same pattern as the expurgations dis- cussed in the previous section. Thus, the plea “may we produce no  son or pupil who disgraces himself in public” (b. Berakhot 17b), which  some early manuscripts of the Talmud had glossed with “like Jesus  the Nazarene,”73 was rephrased as “may we produce no dishonest son  or pupil.” Haselbauer’s concern about the Talmud containing “slurs  against the saints of the Old Testament” was addressed by altering  the text of the stories about Hannah, Elijah, and Moses in b. Berakhot  31b and 32a: statements about these figures “speaking insolently” to- ward heaven were replaced with statements about them “praying” to- ward heaven.74 Concern about stories offending natural law resulted in  the rewriting of the story of Dinah, who according to talmudic lore was  conceived as a male fetus and was “changed to a girl” in the middle of  Leah’s pregnancy (b. Berakhot 60a); the relevant sentence was re- placed with the statement that Dinah was “created as a girl.”  The rejection of the idea that the Talmud might contain credible ac- counts of otherworldly interventions in the affairs of this world is epito- mized by the replacement of “the ministering angels said” with “it is  written in the Torah” (b. Berakhot 20b). In accordance with the compre- hensive paradigm of censorship, a few lines later the statement “He re- plied to them,” implying God’s dialogue with the angels, was replaced  with “The Holy One, blessed be he, said.” The issue of anthropomor- phism and “improper” or “erroneous” conceptions of God was ad- dressed in a series of additional alterations. The phrase in b. Berakhot  61a, “God created two inclinations, one good and the other evil,” which  </page> <page sequence="26"> seemed to attribute the creation of evil to God, was recast as a much  more neutral statement, reading simply, “there are two inclinations in a  [172] human being.” The query of b. Berakhot 7a, “How do we know that the  Holy One, blessed be he, says prayers?,” which seemed to impinge on  Jewish God’s omnipotence or imply the existence of a being larger than him,  Social was altered to “How do we know that the Holy One, blessed be he,  Studies makes demands?” God’s “giving right” (i.e., again, admitting to having  • made a mistake) to Moses (b. Berakhot 32a) was rephrased as a state- Vol. 20 No. 2 ment that God “agreed” with Moses. On the same page, the proclama- tion that Moses “revived” God with his words was changed into a  statement that Moses “praised” God with his words.  All the alterations of the talmudic text discussed so far followed  the same principles as the expurgations, which in turn reflected  Haselbauer’s guidelines for “correcting” the Talmud as formulated in  his instructions for the Jewish precensors and his letters and memos  to the Prague consistory. Because the lack of the sources does not  allow me to assess which of these changes Haselbauer specifically de- manded and which Eibeschütz volunteered or suggested, it is safest to  treat them all as reflecting Haselbauer’s position. I shall now turn to  examples of changes that go beyond his explicit guidelines. Rather  than reflecting an openly stated censorial program, they stem from  the implicit views of the censors. This subcategory of amendments  comprises two further types of changes. The first type consists of corrections and adjustments of a linguistic  or stylistic nature. For example, all instances of euphemistic speech  that implied an opposite meaning (lashon sagi nahor) were replaced by  straightforward utterances. Thus, “destruction coming upon the ene- mies of Israel” (b. Berakhot 28b) became “destruction coming upon Is- rael,” and “a sword is upon the enemies of the disciples of the wise” (b.  Berakhot, 63b) was changed to “a sword is upon the disciples of the wise.”  Furthermore, most of the convoluted sentences containing correlative  conjunctions of the “not/nothing . . . but” (eino . . . ela) type were rewrit- ten more straightforwardly. Hence “The Holy One, blessed be he, does  not give wisdom but to those who already have wisdom” (ein ha-Kadosh  barukh hu noten hokhmah ela le-mi she-yesh bo hokhmah; b. Berakhot 55a) was  rephrased as “The Holy One, blessed be he, gives wisdom to the one  who already has wisdom” (ha-Kadosh barukh hu noten hokhmah le-mi she- yesh bo hokhmah); “thunders were not created for any reason other than  to straighten out the crookedness of the heart” (lo nivreu re‘amim ela li- fshot akmumiut sheba-lev; b. Berakhot 59a) became “thunders were cre- ated in order to straighten out the crookedness of the heart” (nivreu  re‘amim li-fshot akmumiut sheba-lev).75 In very few cases, the contents of the  </page> <page sequence="27"> talmudic narrative were adjusted. A case in point is a parable of a man  who, while traveling, encountered a wolf, a lion, and a snake. The un- censored text of b. Berakhot 13a reads as follows: [173] A man was travelling on the road when he encountered a wolf and es- The Rabbi and  caped from it, and he went along relating the affair of the wolf. He then the Jesuit encountered a lion and escaped from it, and went along relating the af- • fair of the lion. He then encountered a snake and escaped from it, Paweł  whereupon he forgot the two previous incidents and went along relating Maciejko the affair of the snake. So with Israel: the later troubles make them for- get the earlier. In the Prague edition, this section was rewritten slightly, the snake  replaced by a tiger. Initially, I believed that this change had some- thing to do with the symbolic overtones of the motif of the snake in  Kabbalah and in Jewish messianic doctrines. Yet this interpretation  felt strained, and the tiger—in contrast to the snake—has no sym- bolic valence in the Jewish tradition. I am inclined to think that the  change in the narrative was brought about by literary considerations:  the logic of the story demanded that the third animal be a large pred- atory mammal rather than a reptile. The parable became, as it were,  more symmetrical and rounded. The linguistic and stylistic amendments introduced by the censor- editors of the Prague edition of tractate Berakhot are too few to make  any strong claims based solely on them. Some inkling as to their mean- ing, however, can be offered. Against the wider historical backdrop,  they are unprecedented: early modern censorship of Jewish books was  a theological and political enterprise and neither Haselbauer nor, as  far as I know, any other Christian involved in it had ever expressed the  need to edit their language and style. Jewish editors, in turn, always  tried to preserve the utterances of the ancient sages faithfully. In con- trast, the Prague edition of tractate Berakhot contains a number of al- terations that do not seem to have anything to do with the theological  or political concerns of the censors; they have a purely literary charac- ter. As they do not seem to be responses to any of Haselbauer’s con- cerns or demands, I believe that they are the handiwork of Eibeschütz  and are the result of his own considerations. Eibeschütz seems to have  been the only early modern Jewish author who believed that the talmu- dic sages needed to be edited for style. For themselves, such changes  were only possible thanks to the editorial freedom Eibeschütz granted  himself in his “Apology and Answer of the Rabbis of Prague”: Eibe- schütz considered the talmudic text open and unfinished and there- fore felt free to “correct” it even in instances in which he experienced  </page> <page sequence="28"> no external pressure from the church or from any other powerbro- kers. As for the character of these changes, one thing can be said  [174] with certainty: most of them aimed to create a neater and simpler  text of the Talmud, one that avoids intricate grammatical construc- Jewish tions or potentially misleading expressions.  Social Before turning to a discussion of the possible reasons for and  Studies wider implications of the linguistic amendments to the text of the  • Gemarah, I will cite some examples of the second type of censorship  Vol. 20 No. 2 that reached beyond Haslbauer’s guidelines: alterations that do ex- press a coherent, if never explicitly formulated, theological and ideo- logical position. The most easily discerned tendency underlying the  censorial amendments of the Prague text is the qualification or re- striction of the authority of the talmudic sages (and, by extension, of  contemporary rabbis). Religious precepts in the Talmud were re- phrased to ensure they referred only to Jews. The uncensored text of  b. Berakhot 4b reads, “And whosoever transgresses the words of the  sages deserves to die.” This was rewritten as “He who professes the  Jewish religion [or possibly: he who adheres to the Jewish law] and  transgresses the words of the sages deserves to die at the hands of  heaven.” Thus, the authority of the rabbis was curtailed twofold: it  was said to bind only observant Jews, and the punishment for non- compliance was relegated to the hands of God. Similarly, the talmu- dic dictum “If one omits to say ‘True and firm’ in the morning and  ‘True and trustworthy’ in the evening, one has not performed one’s  obligation” (b. Berakhot 12a) was replaced with “If a Jew omits to say  ‘True and firm’ in the morning and ‘True and trustworthy’ in the  evening, he has not performed his obligation.” The restriction and diminution of the authority of Jewish religious  leaders was strengthened by the rewriting of passages concerning the  importance of Jewish sacred spaces and liturgical time in a manner  aimed at decreasing their relevance. Hence, “Whenever the Holy  One, blessed be he, comes into a synagogue and does not find 10 per- sons there, he becomes angry at once” (b. Berakhot 6b) was qualified  as “Whenever the Holy One, blessed be he, comes into a synagogue at  the time of the prayer and does not find 10 persons there, he becomes  angry at once.” “A man’s prayer is heard [by God] only in the syna- gogue” (b. Berakhot 6a) was replaced with “A man’s prayer is heard [by  God] especially in the synagogue.” The censors’ preoccupation with  religious time and space was not limited to contemporary Jewish time  and space; it was typified by a wider tendency to restrict Judaism’s  temporal and spatial validity to ancient times and to the Land of Is- rael. The uncensored text of b. Berakhot 57b reads,  </page> <page sequence="29"> Our rabbis taught: If one sees a statue of Hermes, he says, “Blessed be  he who shows long suffering to those who transgress his will.” If he sees  a place from which idolatry has been uprooted, he says, “Blessed be he [175] who uprooted idolatry from our land; and as it has been uprooted from  this place, so may it be uprooted from all places belonging to Israel.” The Rabbi and  the Jesuit In the Prague edition, this narrative was shortened and refashioned: • “Our rabbis taught: one coming to the Land of Israel and seeing a Paweł  place from which the Canaanite Asherah has been uprooted should Maciejko say, ‘Blessed be he who uprooted pagan worship from our land.’” Sim- ilarly, the Mishnah on b. Berakhot 54a, “On seeing a place from which  idolatry has been extirpated, one should say: ‘Blessed be he who ex- tirpated idolatry from our land,’” was qualified in the following way:  “On coming to the Land of Israel and seeing a place from which the  Canaanite Asherah has been extirpated, one should say: ‘Blessed be  he who extirpated idolatry from our land.’” Restricting Judaism’s hostility to (and triumph over) alien cults  solely to ancient Palestine may be seen, again, as an attempt to blunt  its anti-Christian sting. However, when combined with the tendency  to limit both the authority of the rabbis and the importance of con- temporary Jewish sacred space and time, it might also be read as an  expression of a Christian supersessionist theological position. This  impression is strengthened by several other talmudic locutions that  touch upon divine verdicts pertaining to the fate and status of the  people of Israel. Thus, passages concerning the Exile were rewritten  in a manner clarifying that it had befallen only the Jews and that its  theological meaning could not be extended to other peoples. “Since  the day when the Temple was destroyed, a decree has been issued  against the houses of the righteous that they should become deso- late” (b. Berakhot 58b) was refashioned as “Since the day when the  Temple was destroyed, a decree has been issued against the houses of  the seniors of Israel that they should become desolate.” Likewise re- written was material emphasizing the election of Israel. One such tal- mudic passage discusses three things that Moses requested from  God. The uncensored text, as attested by most manuscripts and pre- Trent editions of the Talmud, described Moses’s second request as  follows: “He asked that the divine presence not rest upon the idola- ters, and it was granted to him” (b. Berakhot 7a). This statement was  censored in the Basel edition, where it reads, “He asked that the di- vine presence should rest only upon Israel, and it was granted to  him.” The Prague edition qualified the sentence even further: “He  asked that the divine presence should then [at that time] rest only  </page> <page sequence="30"> upon Israel, and it was granted to him,” suggesting that the special  status enjoyed by Israel was granted for a limited time only. [176] Jewish Theology Underlying the Editorial Amendments in the   Social Prague Berakhot Studies • As noted earlier, Haselbauer did not want merely to eliminate anti- Vol. 20 No. 2 Christian sentiment from the Talmud; he also wanted the work to be- come positively pro-Christian. His two books on Judaism and  Christianity (one of which was written concomitantly with his editorial  labors on Berakhot) express unmistakably supersessionist views, and it is  fair to assume that he would have wanted the Talmud to be permeated  with the same theological and historiosophical ideas. The passages dis- cussed here seem to indicate that this program was implemented by  the censors; at first glance, though Eibeschütz might have been respon- sible for the practical execution of Haselbauer’s program, he did not  seem to implant any ideas of his own in the Prague edition of the Tal- mud. I wish to argue, however, that this impression is incorrect. Al- though most doctored passages of the Prague edition of Berakhot do  express Christian supersessionist positions, some display a slight excess  of meaning that, in my opinion, may hint at different views.  I submit that Eibeschütz utilized his position as Haselbauer’s col- laborator in editing the Prague Berakhot in order to implement his  own theological agenda. Not only did he make changes reflecting the  position of the church, as Haselbauer demanded, but he did more  than was required of him, creating additional amendments that re- flected his own position. To return to the last example, the statement  that Moses requested “that the divine presence should at that time  rest only upon Israel, and it was granted to him” may certainly be  read narrowly as an expression of the idea that the election of Israel  was temporary and, by then, long gone and that Judaism had been  superseded by Christianity. Yet it may also be taken as denoting the  idea that in Haselbauer and Eibeschütz’s time, the divine presence  rested not solely upon Israel but also upon members of other nations  and religions. Such a universalist reading is supported by several  other passages. Thus, the statement that Abraham was the first man  since the creation of the world to recognize the creator as his “Lord”  (therefore making him the “founder of monotheism”; b. Berakhot 7b)  was changed by the Prague censors to “we know of no man before  Abraham who called the Holy One, blessed be he, ‘Lord.’” Whatever  the rationale for this change, it does not seem to be motivated simply  </page> <page sequence="31"> by Christian supersessionism. Rather, in addition to expressing rec- ognition of the fundamental inadequacy of human knowledge of the  past, it implies that there might have been other, pre-Abrahamic rev- [177] elations of the true God. I believe that Eibeschütz’s original contributions to the editing of The Rabbi and  the Prague edition of tractate Berakhot were precisely such allusions to the Jesuit universalist religious views that transcended the boundaries of both • contemporary Judaism and contemporary Christianity. I further be- Paweł  Maciejko lieve that these allusions should be interpreted alongside the stylistic  and grammatical alterations aimed at simplifying and disambiguating  the text of the Talmud. Eibeschütz’s statement that the aim of the  Prague printing was to make the most canonical text of Judaism  “openly available to all the nations” was not mere rhetoric; achieving  this aim demanded both editing the content of the Talmud and mak- ing it easier to read. The Prague printing of tractate Berakhot represents  an effort to create a more palatable Talmud, both in the sense of its ac- cessibility to those lacking rabbinic (or, more widely, traditional Jewish)  education and in the sense of adjusting it to the sensibilities of people  from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. If my analysis of the  archival documents is correct, Eibeschütz began to be actively involved  in the debates leading to the publication of the Prague edition of trac- tate Berakhot in October 1726. This was exactly a year after the eruption  of the scandal surrounding the discovery of Va-avo ha-yom el ha-‘ayin by  the rabbinic authorities. Va-avo ha-yom el ha-‘ayin is Eibeschütz’s theo- logical manifesto; as I demonstrated in the introduction to my critical  edition of this work,76 the theology expounded in this tractate portrays  our world as the world governed by the modus of deity called Atikah  Kadishah, the Holy Ancient One,  a God of undifferentiated Mercy who gives His love equally to everyone  and does not choose any people over another, who does not know the  distinction between Israel and the Nations of the World, is not bound by  the commandments of the Torah and does not punish even those who  do not heed them; He is the God of the entirety of humanity, of the Pa- triarchs, especially of Abraham, and not the God of Moses.77  Va-avo ha-yom el ha-‘ayin ends with Deuteronomy 33:3: “He also loves the  nations,” which, in my view, is a hint at the hope of universal redemp- tion. The treatise also suggests that this god of universal redemption is  the Christian god, or, in a somewhat weaker formulation, the god rec- ognized and worshipped by Christians. As I have argued, in Va-avo ha- yom el ha-‘ayin Eibeschütz is walking a fine line between acknowledging  the universal dimension of Christianity and recognizing its deity as the  </page> <page sequence="32"> ruling deity of this world, and recognizing Christianity as his religion  and its god as his god; in the final analysis, I have argued, Eibeschütz  [178] believes the Christian world to be an unredeemed world of exile that  the Jewish people can neither join nor escape, and Israel must not ac- Jewish cept its god as theirs.78 Social I believe that the Prague edition of tractate Berakhot is permeated  Studies with the same theological sentiments and ideas as Va-avo ha-yom el ha- • ‘ayin; having formulated them in a kabbalistic tract in 1725, Eibe- Vol. 20 No. 2 schütz implanted them also in his edition of the Talmud prepared  between 1726 and 1728. In both cases, the ideas were understated  and were bound to be misunderstood by most his contemporaries.  This leads me back to Raz-Krakotzkin’s thesis about the censorship of  Hebrew books being an element of a “civilizing process” leading to  the creation of “Judeo-Christian civilization.” As much as I sympa- thize with this idea, I do not believe that there was room for a Judeo- Christian civilization in early eighteenth-century Europe. Haselbauer  and other Christians wanted to turn the Talmud into a Christian text  that could be used for the purpose of missionizing among the Jews.  Jewish readers inadvertently interpreted universalist undercurrents  in Eibeschütz’s thought as signs of Christian belief. Writing about  Eibeschütz’s tenure in Prague, Rabbi Jacob Emden remarked: At that time Eibeschütz had the worst reputation among the majority of  the Jews. . . . On the other hand, among the Christian priests Eibeschütz  enjoyed great respect. Among them he had power and a name [Isaiah  56:5]. There is no doubt that he misled them by showing respect toward  their faith. At first, he disputed with them and he beat them. And maybe  this was so at the beginning, but later the evil, filthy scent stuck to him.  It already became known that he himself believes in Jesus [Ha-notsri]. I  cannot dwell on that matter here. Be it as it may, he enjoyed favor with  the priests.79  In the 1720s in Prague the only language available for the expres- sion of universalist ideas was the language of Christian theology, and  every expression of such ideas could not but be understood as a state- ment of Christian belief. Rumors about Eibeschütz’s crypto-Christi- anity began to circulate shortly after the publication of the censored  edition of tractate Berakhot and accompanied him throughout his  life. In the 1750s, Carl Anton, Eibeschütz’s student who converted to  Christianity and wrote in his defense, mentioned that “when the  Royal Appellate [Court] took notice of [Eibeschütz’s] exceptional  learning and uprightness, it appointed him the chief censor, which  function was normally performed by the chief rabbi. No Jewish book  </page> <page sequence="33"> could have been published without his approval.”80 Anton also men- tioned rumours concerning Eibeschütz’s crypto-Christianity and  stated that the matter was too delicate to discuss publicly. However, [179] he continued, if Eibeschütz really were a hidden Christian, “for the  audacious Jews it would be so similar [to heresy] that they would de- The Rabbi and  scribe [him] as a heretic.”81 Anton concluded: the Jesuit • In any case, it must have considerably aggravated the malicious Jews that Paweł  Rabbi Jonathan did not agree with those who claimed that the doctrine Maciejko of love of one’s neighbor should be restricted only to the Jews, who  should care only about other Jews, but claimed that this love is universal  in character [diese Liebe allgemein ist] and that it is as great a sin to cause  detriment to people of another religion as to harm members of one’s  own family.82  It was the sages of the Talmud, first and foremost, who interpreted  the biblical concept of neighbor narrowly as referring solely to the  Jews, in their discussion of the goring ox (b. Baba Kamma 37b–38a).  Alas, we have no inkling if and how Eibeschütz would have edited this  section of Baba Kamma: following the uproar generated by the publi- cation of the censored Berakhot, the chief rabbi of Prague, David Op- penheim, forbade Eibeschütz to engage in further editorial work  with Haselbauer, and the 1728 edition of the first tractate of the Baby- lonian Talmud remained the only published fruit of their collabora- tion.83 To the best of my knowledge, only three copies of this edition  are extant today.84 Eibeschütz himself did not seem to have many illusions about how  his contemporaries understood him. Among the editorial amend- ments of the Prague edition of the Talmud there are two rewritten  passages that, in my opinion, reflect on Eibeschütz’s position vis-à-vis  his prospective readers and his understanding of their perception of  his efforts. The first is the rewriting of b. Berakhot 7b, “If a man has a  fixed place for his prayer, his enemies succumb to him,” which be- came “If a man has a fixed place for his prayer, his enemies do not  know how to answer him.” The second is the last sentence of the trac- tate, the sentence that every rabbinic student of the time must have  known by heart. The uncensored text of the Talmud reads, “The dis- ciples of the wise [talmidei hakhamim] have no rest either in this world  or in the world to come.” Eibeschütz radicalized this dictum. The  final sentence of the 1728 Prague edition of Berakhot reads, “The dis- ciples of the wise experience no rest, ever.” And neither did Rabbi  Jonathan Eibeschütz. </page> <page sequence="34"> Notes [180] The research that led to the results presented in this article was made pos- sible by funding from the European Research Council under the European  Jewish Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant  Social Agreement no. 263689 – TCCECJ.

The 1564 Index of  Prohibited Books issued by the Council of Trent under Pius IV  introduced a new category of books, “banned until expurgated.” The  Talmud was assigned to this category and permitted to be printed  provided it be published without the name Talmud and expunged of  all anti-Christian content. The description of the process of  expurgation “according to Trent” on the title pages of the Basel  Talmud refers to the Index of 1564 (under Pius IV), not that of 1596  (under Clement VIII). </page> <page sequence="36">  29 Haselbauer, “Catholisches Gutachten,” f. 26.  30 Ibid., f. 28.
