<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIENTAL IDEAS ON THE ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE* FRITS STAAL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY The legend of Genesis 2.19-20, which expresses a view about the development from names to nouns, and other ideas attributed to, read into and superimposed upon it, have influenced the course of Western speculation on language for several millennia. Thus arose one of the most misleading notions of mankind: the idea that language originates from naming. This idea occured not only in the Ancient Near East, but also in Greece and China. It implied that grammar is not part of language, but imposed upon it from the outside. The Chinese had also more sophisticated ideas, e.g., that language consists of sentences and propositions in addition to names. Language, morever, is not only for naming but also for issuing orders. To the Indians, language is primarily for doing, not for naming. Accordingly, there is a close connexion with ritual, which suggests that the origin of language is in fact partly ritual. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: In 1975, the New York Academy of Sciences organized a conference of more Wagnerian propor- tions than our own. It was devoted to the origins and evolution of language and speech. Contributions were made by linguists, philosophers, psychologists, biolo- gists, anthropologists, neurologists and others. The first paper, by Hans Aarsleff, surveyed theories on the origin of language since the Renaissance. In the discussion, Gordon Hewes, known for his work on the gestural theory of language origin, asked Aarsleff whether he was right in thinking that serious specula- tion on this topic was uniquely Western, since, as far as he knew, "intellectual concern with the problem of the origin of language beyond legend or myth is not outstanding in any other major civilization, any other major literature such as Chinese, or even Indic philos- ophy." Aarsleff answered: "Yes, but I feel I know hardly anything about the subject." As you will have learned, knowlege is ephemeral, but prejudices are tenacious. It is not that I know much more about the subject than these two gentlemen; but I am well disposed to it. If one hopes to progress from prejudice to knowledge, with all due deference to Archimedes, two roads are open: one slow, the other fast. The slow one is to acquire knowledge by assiduous study. This road is reserved for students. The fast one is to hold forth on the subject in the company of those who know. This road is reserved for presidents of learned societies. In embarking upon this second road, I trust you will afterwards grant me the knowledge I shall appear to have withheld in the course of this address. The only procedural question now remaining is where to start, and in which direction to move. Though I shall move about freely, I have decided to start in an area with which many of us are familiar, and end on those distant tracks where I am more at home myself. To connect these two with other regions of interest, I shall go due west. After the Ancient Near East, which continues to determine contemporary ideas on the subject, I shall touch on Egypt, pass through the Pillars of Hercules and the Panama Canal, beyond the confines of our Society, enter East Asia and come to a stop in South Asia. I shall pay scant attention to chronology and history. While these limitations are mostly arbitrary, it is significant that it will be generally impossible to make a sharp distinction between myths, legends, serious speculation and intellectual concern. In the second chapter of Genesis, God is concerned that man should not be alone. "So God Yahweh formed out of the soil various wild beasts and birds of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he called them; whatever the man would call a living creature, that was to be its name. The man gave names to all cattle, all birds of the sky, and all wild beasts."' This passage is significant both for its connections with other biblical ideas, and for its influence on Western thought. I shall review five points: (1) naming as a creative act; (2) naming as an expression of ownership; (3) the distinction between men and animals; (4) the origin of language; and (5) the emphasis on naming. (1) Many of the earlier interpreters of this passage have indulged in the allegedly widespread magical belief according to which names are intimately involved with the essence ofthings. Even N. M. Sarna, among moderns, invokes this tendency in order to 1</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) explain that giving a name is connected with creativity.2 According to him, naming initiates creation, but since God in Genesis created before naming, he resorts to the hypothesis that "in the scriptural demythologizing process the order has been reversed." To illustrate this further, Sarna refers to the Egyptian God Atum, who brought other Gods into being by naming the parts of his body. Similarly, new eras were marked by kings or other prominent individuals changing names. There are instances in the Old Testament, for example, Abram's name being changed into Abraham.3 I need hardly remind you of the fact that such phenomena are not confined to the Ancient Near East. We proclaim democracies all over the world, and, even on the academic front, at least in California, colleges turn into universities overnight. Though there is scope for psychology here, we may safely accept the view of Von Rad and others that the explanation of this passage from Genesis does not require the allegedly primitive view of the connection between a name and its bearer.4 (2) Our passage belongs to the so-called Yahwist strand of Genesis. In the Priestly source of Genesis 1 (26-28) we have been told that the animals are subject to man. It is not surprising, then, to find this dominion also emphasized in the Yahwist passage. Whether such repetitions exhibit the redundancy which is charac- teristic of all communication5 is not relevant here: we find the naming of someone or something as an expression of ownership throughout the Old Testa- ment.6 Man himself receives his name from God a little later, in Genesis 5:2. It seems to me that Cassuto (who provides the above references) has also given the most balanced interpretation: "The Lord of the universe named the parts of the universe and its time-divisions,7 and He left it to man to determine the names of those creatures over which He had given him dominion."8 What is left of this freedom? We still exercise it when we name our cats and dogs. In the more didactic than exegetical Jewish literature of the Midrash we come across another familiar element. Adam is por- trayed as more intelligent than the angels, but at the same time treated as a small child in tones reminiscent of the playpen. First God paraded the animals before the angels, and asked them their name. They did not know. Then he paraded them before Adam and asked him: "What is the name of this?"-"An ox."-"And of this?"-"A camel."-"And of this?"-"An ass." -After the horse, God asks: "And what is your name?" and finally: "And what is My name?"9- Noteworthy in this Midrash version is the implicit analogy between the origin of language and the attempt to teach language to children. In spite of what the Midrash story suggests, it is important to observe that the Genesis legend pertains to proper names and not to common nouns. The difference is this. If dogs were already known by the common noun "dog," God would merely have tested man's knowledge of a part of his vocabulary. But if God really left it to man to determine the names at least of animals, man called a certain beast for the first time by a proper name-say, "Dobermannpinscher." In due course this developed into a family or generic name, so that all such beasts came to be called "Dobermannpinscher." Finally the name "Dobermann- pinscher" became a common noun, dobermann- pinscher. Underlying Genesis 2 is a theory that some such development took place. This is not explicit because there is no clear distinction between names and nouns, which in turn is due to the simple fact that in biblical Hebrew, there is only one word, shem, to refer to both. (3) Our Genesis passage does not refer to Dober- mannpinschers, but it certainly makes much of the distinction between men and animals. No wonder that in due course even humans felt the need for animal liberation. This observation takes us from interpreta- tion of the text to a broader consideration of its significance and later influence. We may note in passing that such a transition also provides an illus- tration of the emptiness of names: for a concern which is broader than textual interpretation is not made any better or clearer by giving it a name, such as "hermeneutics," for example. In many civilizations, men and animals are placed on a more equal footing than in Genesis. Examples abound. In the ancient Egyptian hymn to Amon-Re of the 18th dynasty (1550-1350 B.c.), the God is simply said to have "made mankind and created the beasts."10 In India, Daksa, a son of Brahma, created sages, gods, heavenly musicians, men, serpents, demons, tree spirits, ghosts, devils, birds, domestic cattle and wild beasts.11 We find Gods with animal features and animal Gods in Egypt, India, and elsewhere. Nor is this tendency confined to the realm of ideas. I need only remind you of the buddhist king Asoka, who established animal hospitals in the third century B.C. Closer to our subject we find world-wide references to animal language and, in fairy tales, stories of men who converse with animals. In the Koran, for example, Sulaiman, unlike his biblical prototype Solomon, but like the Midrash, knows the language of birds (27:16), a theme further developed by the mystic Farrd al-Din 'Attar (12th century) in an allegorical work entitled Manfiq at-tair, "The Speech of the Birds." 2</page><page sequence="3">STAAL: Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language A section from a Taoist work, the Lieh-tzi,(a) dating from about 300 A.D. according to A. C. Graham, deserves to be quoted in full: When the Yellow Emperor made war against Yen-ti in the wilds of Fan-ch'uan, he commanded bears, wolves, leopards and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, pheasants, falcons and kites as his standard- bearers. This is an example of mastering the beasts and birds by force. When Yao made K'uei his director of music, he beat the stone chimes and all the beasts joined in the dance; he performed the nine parts of the Hsiao-shao music, and the phoenix came to dance to its rhythm. This is an example of attracting the beasts and birds by music. In what way, then, are the minds of beasts and birds different from man's? Since they differ from man in shape and voice, we do not know the Way to make contact with them, but the sage knows everything and understands everything, and that is why he succeeds in drawing them to him and making them his servants. There are ways in which the intelligence of beasts and birds is by nature similar to man's. They wish as much as we do to preserve their lives, and do not have to borrow from man's wisdom to do so. Buck and doe mate together, mother and child keep close together; they shun the plains and choose inaccessible places, avoid cold and seek out warmth; they live in herds and travel in formations with the young ones on the inside and the fully grown on the outside; they lead each other to water and call to each other when they find food. In the most ancient times men and animals lived together and walked side by side. In the time of the Five Emperors and the Three Kings, the animals were frightened away and scattered for the first time. In our own degenerate times, they crouch in hiding and flee to their lairs to avoid harm. Even now, in the country of Chieh in the East, there are many people who understand the speech of domes- tic animals; this is a discovery possible even to our limited knowledge. The divine sages of the most ancient times knew the habits of all the myriad things, and interpreted the cries of all the different species; they called them together for meetings and gave them instructions, as though they were human beings. So the fact that the sages would meet the spirits and goblins first, next summon the human beings of the eight quarters, and finally assemble the birds and beasts and insects, implies that there are no great differences in mind and intelligence between living species. The divine sages knew that this was the case, and therefore in teaching they left out none of them.12 I have quoted these views at some length not because I wish to moralize, but because they are relevant to our topic. Though there have been exceptions (in Kabba- lah, Zohar, fairy tales, etc.), the view that language is the distinguishing mark that separates men from ani- mals is characteristic of the Western heritage. It is an indispensable part of the philosophy of such men as Herder, von Humboldt and-Cassirer. It is not confined to philosophy. Max Miiller, the Sanskritist, "was never tired, to the end of his days, of arguing that this possession of language was the death-blow to Dar- winism."13 Recognizing this does not imply that we should lean over backwards and accept all animal systems of communication as language. But since the gap Westerners feel is largely cultural, it would seem advisable that we continue to look for animal fore- runners of features of language, even if what has so far been offered does not look promising. (4) The Genesis passage says very little about the origin of language. It does not claim that man created language, or that God created language. It suggests, as we have seen, that names developed into nouns, and therefore presupposes language. This is confirmed by other passages. God did not only give names before man did; he also frequently addressed man. You cannot address without language. Hence the prevailing Western view, that language is of divine origin- a view not challenged seriously until Herder's Abhandlung iiber den Ursprung der Sprache of 1772. According to Herder, Genesis 2 indicates that man created language by deriving names from the various sounds which animals produce. The fact that Genesis pictures God as addressing man has occasioned a host of interpretations and comments. Leaving aside the discussion on whether the medium used was Hebrew or another language, we find Jacob Grimm in 1851 gently pointing out that if God spoke language, we must assume that he had teeth, but since teeth were not created for speech but for eating, we must assume that he also ate, and this leads to so many other undesirable assumptions that we had better abandon the idea altogether.14 Even Ludwig Wittgenstein made a note on the subject. According to him, if someone says that you can't hear God address someone else, since you can hear him only if you are being addressed yourself, such a person is making a grammatical remark.15 He means, presumably, that the expression "God addresses x," where x is a variable, admits only a single constant as a substitute for x. In other words, the verb "address" with God as subject is structurally similar to such verbs as "single out." 3</page><page sequence="4">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) (5) We now come to the least obvious but most fundamental feature of the Genesis passage: the emphasis on naming. I believe that we have here one of the main roots of one of the most misleading notions of mankind: the idea that language is naming. It is only one of its possible roots. In Greek, too, there is only one word, 6voua, for "name" and "noun." Plato confounded language and naming, albeit in a some- what sophisticated fashion, without having read Genesis; so did the Chinese philosopher Hsiin Tzu, as we shall see. These parallels reveal that we are not dealing with mere prejudice, but that naming is indeed a prominent feature of language. Yet the theory that language consists only of names is as adequate as the theory that nature consists only of pebbles. The easiest way to see this is by using the inventory method. In language, there are not only names, but also other nouns; not only nouns, but also verbs and other parts of speech; not only words, but also sentences, not to mention phonemes, morphemes, paragraphs and the rest. All these hang together in manifold and mysterious ways, as you well know. In brief, language has a structure, which is expressed by its grammar. Genesis 2, without saying so, has con- tributed to the widespread though mostly implicit view, that grammar, instead of exhibiting its structure, is imposed upon language from the outside. This is the view of the man in the street, who thinks that language consists of words so that philology and linguistics both reduce to etymology. But this view is also widespread in scholarly and academic circles. Before discussing it let me give three examples from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries: (a) Herder, in his essay, states it with classical succinctness: "Since every grammar is only a philosophy of language and a method of its use, it follows that the more original the language, the less grammar there must be in it, and the oldest (language) is simply the vocabulary of nature."'6 (b) Theodore Benfey, in the Introduction to his Vedic grammar of 1874, claimed that the Indians have left us on the one hand (in the Vedas) the most beautiful language without a grammar based upon it, and on the other hand (in Panini) the most beautiful grammar with- out the language upon which it is based.17 (c) Karl Jaspers, the existentialist philosopher, in the chapter on language from his gigantic Von der Wahrheit (1947), after criticizing several linguists, says: "In Jespersen we find instructive common sense and a great variety of facts combined with blind resistence to any discussion which goes in depth. Scholars, proud of their scientific method, produce the most amazing and unsound etymologies."18 This amazing juxtaposition shows how Jas- pers' own profundity has prevented him from recognizing the distinction between etymology and linguistics, or words and language. In the Western and Islamic traditions, logicians have since Aristotle understood that language has a structure. The medieval logicians, for example, distin- guished from ordinary terms, such as nouns and verbs, syncategoremata, such as "not," "is," "every," "if." Though the respective domains do not exactly coincide, the Chinese grammarians recognized some of these functional words as "empty" words, and the Indian grammarians as in-cidentals or "things-falling-in- between" (nipata). Western linguists recognized them, and yet often remained suspicious of logic. Even de Saussure did not recognize that they had been discovered by logicians because he felt that logic was normative and had nothing to contribute to the scien- tific study of language.19 Bloomfield, on the other hand, recognized that the Greek logicians had dis- covered the parts of speech and syntactic construction, only "they defined these not in terms of recognizable linguistic forms, but in abstract terms which were to tell the meaning of the linguistic class."20 As you know, meaning is back in linguistics. The correct insights of logic have remained curiously isolated. In philosophy, the clearest formulation of the idea that language is a set of names is due to Augustine, in the 4th century A.D. Its clearest repudiation is due to Wittgenstein, sixteen centuries later. Augustine con- cluded from Genesis 2 that all words are names of objects, and sentences combinations of such names. Here we witness how myth has solidified and turned into serious speculation. Augustine did not merely subscribe to this view in theory, but accepted it in practice. Taking a line from Virgil, starting with the word si, "if," he enumerated the objects of which its constituent words were allegedly names. He inter- preted si as a name for "doubt." Augustine also declined to learn Hebrew, since all knowledge of Hebrew could be obtained from onomastic lists of Hebrew names, such as were widely available at the time.21 I have found that such study is still recom- mended by travel agents. Wittgenstein starts his Philosophical Investigations of 1945 with a quotation from Augustine. Discussing this, he says it is either a primitive idea of how language functions, or the idea of a language more primitive than 4</page><page sequence="5">STAAL: Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language ours. He then constructs a language for which the description of Augustine holds: The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block," "pillar," "slab," "beam." A calls them out;-B brings the stone he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.22 After showing that there are numerous problems inherent in such a conception of language, Wittgen- stein devotes much of the rest of his book to an attempt to show how language works. I find this attempt haphazard, but the experts continue to discuss its merits. I have taken this time to show how a simple idea expressed by an Oriental text, and other ideas attributed to, read into and superimposed upon it, have influenced the course of Western speculation on language for several millennia. Genesis neither offered a theory of language, nor a theory of the origin of language. It contained, implicitly, an idea about the development from names to nouns. Complications started when it was believed that the text dealt with more than it dealt with, and legend became theory. Thus arose the idea that language is a set of names, and that it originated from naming. We are still sorting out the resulting confusions, and I am sure we have not seen the end of them. Let us try to learn at least one thing. It is unlikely that those theories on the origin of language will be adequate, which start with names, or even words, and try to add structure and grammar afterwards. There is one more passage in Genesis to which I wish to draw your attention, this time briefly: the legend of the Tower of Babel.23 As you know this story, which is full of Mesopotamian material, relates how God confounded man's language after man had built a tower from bricks with its top in the sky. According to S. N. Kramer, the legend may have been partly in- spired by what must have been a common sight in Mesopotamia, viz., the "melancholy and pathetic" appearance of ziggurats in a state of disrepair and collapse.24 Speiser has emphasized the literary origins in Mesopotamia. The legend is certainly inspired by a pun in Hebrew on balal, "mixed, confused" and Babel, the name for Babylon which is itself of uncertain origin. The explanation bab-ill, "gate of the gods," is a popular etymology. In Akkadian there were other wordplays, as when Babylon was spoken of as bibil libbisu, "his wish fulfillment."25 In the Sumerian parallel it was Enki, God of Wisdom, who confounded man's speech. The reason is not stated but it may well have been Enki's jealousy of Enlil, a popular rival. According to Kramer, the confounding of languages was in either case due to jealousy and rivalry: in the Sumerian between God and God, in the Hebrew between God and man.26 Speiser translated the first line of the Babel legend as: "The whole world had the same language and the same words,"27 noting that "same" is a translation of the Hebrew adjective "one" in the plural. One need not be a mathematician to be puzzled by a plural one. According to Aaron Shaffer, the expression ahadim, which sometimes denotes a set or pair, is here used to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian, which were regarded as expressions of the same language.28 This becomes intelligible against a long bilingual tradition, during which tablets were written with Sumerian texts on the left and the corresponding Akkadian on the right. The two languages were regarded as languages of compati- bility, mirroring each other. It is of course possible not to realize that different words and even texts represent different languages-it happens with bilingual children. According to Shaffer, the subsequent confounding does not refer to a differentiation of languages but expresses increasing discordance and alienation. I am not competent to comment on the merits of this theory and I don't know whether it has been tested against the data from Old-Babylonian grammar. From about 1600 B.c., grammatical texts analyzed Sumerian texts in terms of Akkadian.29 Considering the sophisti- cated level of these texts, it seems conceivable, but only barely, that the two languages were not distin- guished as languages. These old grammatical works distinguished at any rate clearly between pronouns, adverbs and verbs. It seems a great pity that such insights were not incorporated in the mainstream of the Western tradition, which labored instead under the illusion that language consists of names. The tower of Babel, like all important structures in Mesopotamia, was built from kiln-fired bricks, a rarity in Palestine. The episode of the bricks is again developed in concrete detail in later Jewish legends. They explain how confounding language could cause real harm: "One builder would ask for the mortar, and the other hand him a brick; in a rage, he would throw the brick at his partner and kill him."30 You will remember that Wittgenstein imagined communication between builders when he constructed his artificial biblical language. As a boy of Jewish extraction in Vienna he must have been familiar with the story of 5</page><page sequence="6">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) Babel, and possibly with some of these later legends-- though I grant that his father was an engineer and he himself built at least one house. There is another reference in the Old Testament to the legend of Babel: Zephaniah 3, a prophetic escha- tology which advocates a return to the good old days of pure speech before the dispersion.31 The tower of Babel legend also serves as a prefiguration of the Pentacost in Acts 2, where the multiplicity of languages is overcome by "tongues as if of fire" (yX3ooalt 6oei nrpo6), which seem to address everyone in his own language. One might try to make sense of this by assuming that the Holy Spirit plants meanings directly into the brain, which are verbalized differently by different individuals in line with their own language. Fortunately, I need not pursue this further since it involves Western languages and is therefore beyond the confines of our Society. The same excuse does not apply to another passage in the New Testament which is related to the origin of language: the X6yog speculation at the beginning of John. This is a subject so large that I could not even begin to approach it. However, let me remind those of you who do not know it already, that X6yog specula- tions have flourished in Islam, among philosophers, theologians and mystics. Though Greek and Christian, and perhaps Judaic origins are clear, many of these speculations, e.g., in al-Hallaj, al-Ghazzali, and Ibn 'ArabI, are quite different from anything that developed in the West. These developments could not have taken place without Koranic sources. In the Koran, Christ is referred to as the word (kalima) and spirit (riuh) of God,32 terms which correspond to X6yo; and nveCpla, respectively.33 In due course, X6yog speculations were applied to Muhammed and amr, the creative command of God which is of the form "Be!" (kun). This led to grammatical metaphysics not of nouns but of verbs (afal), based upon the three consonants which in general determine a verbal root in Arabic-as in other Semitic languages. Since meanings were mystically attributed to these letters, the meaning of a root was considered a function of the meanings of the letters, irrespective of their permutations. In Judaism, there were similar developments in the Kabbalah. In Islam, this was called "superior semantics" (ishtiqaq akbar). Ultimately, letters were regarded as the elementary forms of human breath, and our knowledge of them was inculcated upon us when God inspired Adam with breath.34 Though many of the X6yo; and related speculations, whether Judaic, Christian or Muslim, are very mystical and some are decidely eccentric, they are sometimes concerned with semantic features of language and deserve study at least from this perspective. The same can be said of some of the more mystical speculations on mantras we find in India, for example, in Tantrism. I have touched the Islamic middle ages but I promised earlier to pay no attention to history. So let us go back two millennia. In ancient Egypt, the reverence for names seems to have been extraordinary. A person was virtually annihilated when his name was erased. It was worse than losing your social security number. Language and script were considered of divine origin. Thoth, God of wisdom and writing, for example, also "distinguishes one speech from another."35 The ancient Egyptians had a very cosmopolitan attitude with regard to languages, which developed especially during the New Kingdom (16th-llth cen- tury B.C.). Long used to distinguish different languages, and also dialectical differentiation within their own language,36 they came to regard all peoples as creatures of the Sun God, who made them diverse in skin color, character and speech.37 As Sauneron (1960) has shown, this development is conected with the fact that the Egyptian terms ns and whm mean "tongue" as well as "language." This same ambiguity is found in several Semitic and Indo-European languages. The Egyptians not only considered the tongue the organ of speech, they also attributed every modification of speech to a physical modification of the tongue. To learn another language is therefore to twist one's tongue differently. Since they were convinced of the basic equality of all races, they were also convinced of the basic equality of all languages. All have access to the next world, which is shown by the fact that an interpreter resided in heaven.38 This attitude is not only very different from the Old Testament, in which Driver found "dread and aversion for men speaking unintelligible languages;"39 it still contrasts favorably with the attitude of the majority of mankind in 1978. I must also make mention of the well-known story of Herodotus40 according to which the Egyptian king Psammetichus, desiring to find out which was the earliest language, isolated two children from the sounds of language and gave instruction to wait for their first words. The result established that the natural language was Phrygian. Such experiments have occasionally been repeated or thought of in later times. We shall speed westward in the direction of China and India, two civilizations which, like ancient Egypt, regarded themselves as the center of the world. The Chinese were obsessed by writing, just as the Indians were obsessed by language. The Indians could not be 6</page><page sequence="7">STAAL: Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language obsessed by writing for they did not know it during the most formative period of their culture; when they finally imported it, they considered it low and impure. Neither culture was very cosmopolitan, but I think it is fair to say that the Indians outdid the Chinese in self- centredness. Despite the numerous languages spoken within their subcontinent, not to mention others, the Indians paid serious attention only to Sanskrit. The Chinese, at least some of them, and at least in later times, became interested in Sanskrit after Chinese Buddhist pilgrims had begun to visit India. These later efforts of the Chinese to understand Sanskrit throw much light on the way they conceived of language. Their predominant desire was to find out how written characters should be pronounced. In an empire with a highly developed system of writing, and numerous mutually unintelligible dialects, the first challenge is to master the system of writing by relating it to one's own speech; the next, when meeting with another dialect, is to learn its meaning by relating its pronunciation to the script. Such practice does not develop one's concept of linguistic structure, but capacities of much greater value: the eye and the ear. Applying these ideas to the study of Indian scripts, the task seemed ludicrously simple: the characters are few, and they correspond with pronunciation in a simple and straightforward manner. Having mastered these features of language, the Chinese assumed that they knew the Indian language, for what else could there be to know? They were baffled only when they found that they did not really understand it. But a curious circumstance supported their original assumption. Buddhism introduced into China numerous dharant, magical spells, such as om kirikiri vajrabhur bandha ham phat (a mantra, found in Japan, which accom- panies the gesture of the blue lotus: Lokesh Chandra 2). The Chinese were not only ready to receive such sacred noises because they sounded mysterious, resembled the magical formulas of popular Taoism, and were suitable for recitation and meditation; but they also conformed precisely to their idea of language. For as soon as you know how to derive the pronun- ciation of a mantra from the way it is written, you know all there is to know about it. Van Gulik who explained these circumstances in a book41 which he wrote while he was Netherlands Ambassador in India also showed that the Chinese looked upon the syllables of Indian scripts as if they were Chinese idiographic characters-an error which was again fortified by the fact that, in later Indian religion, all syllables were artifically assigned a mystical meaning, just as we earlier met with in Islam and in the Kabbalah. Against this background the various characterizations of Indian languages given by Chinese pilgrims become intelligible.42 Serious obstacles had to be faced when real transla- tion was attempted. Mystic abracadabra afforded no assistance. According to van Gulik, the bulk of the enormous Buddhist Canon could only be translated because Indian and especially Central Asian monks did part of the job. Also, there was close teamwork. Several members of the team first cooperated to transliterate the Sanskrit into Chinese characters, utilizing their phonetic value. Then an official called a Recorder replaced each word by a Chinese equivalent. At this point a Style Corrector came in, who made the result conform to Chinese. A thirteenth century text, translated by van Gulik, comments on this as follows: "In Sanskrit generally that which should come first is placed last; thus they say, 'Buddha praying' instead of 'praying to Buddha,' and 'bell ringing' instead of 'ringing the bell."'43 Several other specialists com- pleted the task: an Assistant Translator, a Deleter and a Style Polisher. The most uncontroversial part of these translations is the part played by the Recorder. He could be as good as his dictionary. A computer fed with a vocabulary would do no worse. But since Sanskrit is inflected and Chinese is not, we must assume that the Recorder primarily arrived at strings of Chinese characters which express what the Chinese grammarians call "full" words, i.e., words which correspond to our nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. The result must have been gibberish. I take it that the Style Corrector knew vaguely what the text was about. He had to provide the structure, i.e., supply many of the "empty" or functional words such as particles and the like. His job was creative and risky, and I doubt a computer could do it, unless it also knew vaguely what the text was about. The resulting structure resembles written Japanese, in which many "full" words are written in Chinese characters, while "empty" words are written in the Japanese syllabary.44 Demieville in his book on the council of Lhasa45 has drawn attention to the role Tibetan played as an inter- mediary in these translation activities. Bilingualism between Tibetan and Chinese was common in those regions of China which were under Tibetan occupation during the eighth century. Conversation manuals were available and Tibetan ambassadors travelling to China had interpreters in their retinue.46 The Chinese attitude with regard to language and script explains their attitude with regard to origins: there are several Chinese legends about the origins of 7</page><page sequence="8">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) writing, but apparently none about the origins of language. With regard to script I shall keep a respectful distance: the East Asia section of our conference has just devoted the afternoon to the earliest Chinese script. Foremost among Chinese scholars who touched upon the origin of language is the Confucian philoso- pher Hsiin Tzu(b) (about 298-238 B.C.). Hsiin Tzu wrote a chapter on the "Rectification of Names" (cheng ming),(c) developing a theme that had been introduced by Confucius saying: "Let the ruler be ruler, the subject subject; let the father be father, and the son son."47 Hsiin Tzu believed that language, like the other artifacts of civilization, was the creation of the sage-kings of old. However, he did not mean the earliest mythical sage-kings, such as Yao and Shun, but the later kings of the Chou dynasty. Are we to infer that those earliest sages did not speak? No, for Hsiin Tzu has specific names in mind, at least at the outset of his essay when he says: In the case of legal terms, they followed the practices of the Yin dynasty; in the case of terms pertaining to ranks and titles, they followed Chou practice; and for the names of ceremonies and ceremonial objects, they followed ritual practice. For the common names applied to all the various things of creation, they followed the established customs of China .. .48 In this opening passage, Hsin Tzu does not refer to the origin of language. In the sequel, his chief purpose seems to be to demonstrate that the state must maintain fixed meanings for words in order to prevent social and political confusion-somewhat like the Academie francaise. Yet there is an ambivalence throughout his essay between specific names and general terms or words. He maintains, for example, that names have no intrinsic appropriateness but are purely conventional -an idea which could be made to apply to all words. Also, he refers to larger units constructed from names, and here it becomes clear that he either means, or ought to mean, words in general: "Propositions are the combinations of names for different realities, put together so as to express a single meaning." I have put this translation together by combining Duyvendak, Bodde, Mei, Dubs, and Watson.49 The term tz '2(d) is translated as "proposition" by the first three, "speech" by the fourth and "phrase" by the fifth. In his forthcoming book Later Mohist Logic, A. C. Graham has shown that the most important innovation of the Mohist work Names and Objects and of Hsin Tzu is precisely the use of tz 'z in the meaning "sentence/pro- position," for the first time distinguished from the name. The distinction, says Graham, "grammatically less marked in Chinese than in Indo-European lan- guages, seems to have attracted attention only after it was noticed that 'knowing is different from having a pictorial idea."' One later philosopher developed these ideas in greater detail, arrived at a doctrine not dissimilar to that of Herder, and we:it beyond that: Tung Chung- shu(e) of the former Hari dynasty (179?-104? B.C.). He refers not only to "names" (ming2(f)) but alsc to "appellations" (hao4(g)), and engages in intricate wordplays on these terms and on ming2(h) ("to utter sounds"), ming4{i) ("orders"), hsiaoO) ("to emit ejacu- lations") and hsiao4(k) ("to mimic"). I am in no position to comment on this analysis, which I shall read in Derk Bodde's translation from Fung Yu-lan's History of Chinese Philosophy: The ancient sages emitted ejaculations which mimicked (the sounds of) Heaven and Earth, and which were called appellations. When issuing orders, they uttered sounds which were called names. Thus names may be described as sounds uttered to give orders, while appel- lations may be described as ejaculations uttured in mimicry. Ejaculations emitted in mimicry of Heaven and Earth constitute appellations; sounds uttered to give orders constitute names. Names and appellations are variously pronounced, but have the same origin in that all consist of sounds and ejaculations uttered to make known the meaning of Heaven. Heaven speaks not yet it enables men to make evident its meaning. It acts not, yet it enables men to conduct themselves in accordance with the mean. Names, therefore, constitute Heaven's meaning as it has been discovered by the sages, and as such they should be deeply looked into.50 Here we find something more than names: issuing orders. Though imperatives do not suffice to explain the origin of language, they are better candidates than names. We should recall that several nineteenth- century Western scholars regarded imperatives as the oldest forms of language because of their formal simplicity (e.g., Latin i, "go!"). In Tun Chung-shu's passage we may also note the advantage of looking at heaven without anthropomorphism: there is no attempt to attribute speech or teeth to it, yet it can be endowed with meaning. It may also be noted that all the Chinese quotes I have so far given come from Confucian sources. What about the Taoists and Buddhists? The early Taoists were not interested in language, and though such an attitude is commendable in general, it does not commend itself to students of language. 8</page><page sequence="9">STAAL: Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language Chuang Tzu said: "A dog is not considered superior because it is good at barking; a man is not considered worthy merely because he is good at speaking."51 Elsewhere he makes a direct recommendation: "There- fore I say, we must have no-words! With words that are no-words, you may speak all your life long and you will never have said anything. Or you may go through your whole life without speaking them, in which case you will never have stopped speaking."52 Such later Taoists as Kuo Hsiang,(O) who died in 312 A.D., commented on the practice of "distinguishing names and analyzing principles" as follows: These bear no relation to the functioning of the state; indeed, they may truly be called useless talk. But since young aristocrats must have some amusement when they are tired with the canonical writing, if they can distinguish names and analyze principles as an expres- sion of their spirit and intellectual discipline, and if this serves to prevent dissipation in future generations, is it not better than gaming?53 In the next great wave of Taoist revelation, the Ling- pao scriptures, composed in the 390s, there is evidence of Indian influence. This must have come together with the dharant sutras which were beginning to flood Chinese religious practice. These scriptures, which provide the basis for all subsequent Taoist liturgy, proposed a theory of their own origin in the primordial "Brahma-sound" (fan-yin(m)), from which issue cosmic and creative "Brahma-breaths" (fan-ch'i(n)), which in turn form the letters of the eternal Ling-pao scriptures. My colleague Michel Strickmann, who has provided this information, feels that these texts are admirably poised between occult mantric practice and the secular science of phonetics that developed in fifth-century China. For more information you have to turn to his article which is about to appear.54 As for Buddhism, let me merely note that the Confucian doctrine that names are conventional helped to pave its way, and that it could not have made any significant progress in China had it not itself considered language conventional and therefore dis- pensable. This belief reflects its early history, for the Buddha spoke not in Sanskrit, but in the local ver- nacular of Magadha. In India, once you dispense with Sanskrit, you have abandoned all fixedness of language. At this point I hope you have enough energy left to follow me across the Himalayas and into India. Here you will expect me to demonstrate that confusions we have found elsewhere did not arise, and correct solutions were finally obtained. Of course, I shall not dash your hopes. But I have to begin with a small disappointment. Sanskrit does not distinguish be- tween names and nouns-at least outside grammar. Both are called naman, which is directly related to Greek 6voga and Latin nomen. The Indians therefore did confuse names and nouns. However, it did not matter much. In India, language is not something with which you name something. It is in general something with which you do something. Therefore, performa- tives, speech acts and pragmatics all developed in India, and verbs are at least as important as nouns. Though nouns are occasionally confused with names, both were regularly distinguished from other kinds of words and parts of speech. At an early date (in the Nirukta and Pratisakhya literature, 6th century B.c.?) the Indians distinguished nouns and verbs (nama- khyata) from each other and also from preverbs (upa- sarga) and particles (nipata). I don't think this was due to the alleged transparency of the Sanskrit language- just as Babylonian astronomy was not due to the alleged brilliance of the Babylonian sky.55 Such an assumption is open to the objections voiced by Brough against a similar assumption entertained with regard to the grammar of Panini: It is customary to add . . . the deprecatory remark that Panini was, of course, aided in his analysis by the extraordinary clarity of the structure of the Sanskrit language; but we are apt to overlook the possibility that this structure might not have seemed so clear and obvious to us if Panini had not analyzed it for us.56 More important than this distinction between parts of speech, and more characteristic of the Indian approach to language, is a feature that is implicit in much Indian speculation and accordingly neglected in Western studies: the Indian theorists tend to look at larger units of language than words. This has escaped notice because of the analysis of words into roots, stems and suffixes which is typical of the Sanskrit grammarians and which gave Indo-European philology its primary impulse. So let us look at this matter a little more carefully. At the same time let me foreclose the possible objection that I pay more attention to gram- mar in India than I have done elsewhere. This may appear to be the case. But the truth of the matter ;s that in India, grammar, the "Veda of the Vedas," pene- trated into all domains of culture, so that the state- ments of a physician, a statesman or an astronomer all sound like grammar. I shall hardly refer to grammar in the technical sense (vyakarana). The earliest analysis of language we find in India is the analysis of the Vedic samhita into its constituent 9</page><page sequence="10">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) words (padapatha). This may have taken place be- tween the 10th and the 7th century B.c. Thepadapdtha is constructed by detaching the words of Vedic utter- ances from each other, dissolving the sandhi combina- tions between them, and breaking the influence of the word accent in as far as it goes beyond word boundaries.57 In general, we tend in this process to emphasize the result, viz., the word-for-word analysis. But what is equally significant is the starting point, viz., the continuous recitation of Vedic utterances (called samhita). Since in India, the analysis of sentences into words preceded the construction of sentences out of words, sentences were, clearly, primary. I can think of at least two reasons for this particular development. The first is that Sanskrit became a subject of serious speculation long before it was written down toward the end of the Vedic period (the name of a more recent script, devanagart, though reminiscent of the term hieroglyphs, may be as late as the 18th century58). It seems reasonable to assume that illit- erate speakers of a language do not perceive the flow of speech as consisting of words, but rather of larger units, such as phrases. The second reason is that the Vedic corpus, which was handed down orally, was thought of as consisting of mantras and similar units at least as long as a verse line or sentence. And the main reason that a mantra is a single unit is its ritual function and character. In Vedic ritual, one mantra corresponds to one ritual act, which itself constitutes a single unit. This is explicitly formulated in the later ritual manuals, e.g.: "the acts are accompanied by single mantras"59 or: "difference of mantra marks difference of act."60 Though Bergaigne and our Secretary-Treasurer, Stanley Insler, would not mind, you might object that many Vedic hymns were not originally composed for ritual ends. Whether true or not, it does not affect the point. When language, i.e., the language of the Vedas, became a topic for serious speculation, it was already thought of as consisting of mantras or units of language which accompany rites. In India, language was generally approached within a ritual perspective. The earliest reference to the origin of language, which occurs in the Rgveda, indicates this. It portrays sages who "fashioned language with their thought, filtering it like parched grain through a sieve," and who "traced the course of language through ritual."61 The first linguistic analysis after the pada- patha is also of ritual language. In fact, grammatical analysis probably originated because the artificial language of ritual (especially in the Samaveda) was so extraordinary, that it simply demanded analysis. The next step was to transfer such analysis to ordinary language, which culminated in the grammar of Panini. The result was a very close connection between grammar and the science of ritual.62 Like language, ritual is recursive: it makes infinite use of finite means. These may turn out to be the most important discoveries which the Indians made in this realm. They discovered the recursiveness of language some two millennia before von Humboldt and Chom- sky; and they were the only ones who discovered the recursiveness of ritual, at about the same time. The construction of rituals of indefinitely increasing com- plexity is exemplified by the so-called sattra rituals.63 These are rituals-most of them never performed and purely theoretical-which are indefinitely extended by modifying and embedding existing rituals and rites. There is no mention or trace of an upper limit. Hillebrandt was eloquent on this: Diejenigen Sattra's, welche langer als zwolf Jahre dauern, heissen mahasattra's... und hier versteigt sich Mythus und Phantasie der Yajiiika's zu den sechsunddreissigjahrigen Opfern der Saktya's, den hundertjahrigen der Sadhya's, den tausendjahrigen der Visvasrj.64 The grammarian Patafijali, when discussing the infinity of language which grammar must describe by finite means, refers to these sattra rituals: There are indeed linguistic expressions which are never used . . . Even though they are not used, they have of necessity to be laid down by rules, just like protracted sattras.65 I believe that the Indian material suggests a much deeper connection between ritual and language, and that the origin of language is in fact partly ritual. It is significant, in this connection, that animals have ritual, and not language. But this would take us far beyond our sources into the realm of serious speculation.66 So far we have looked from language to ritual. Let us now look from ritual to language. The most important feature of Vedic ritual is the recitation of mantras. Even if rites are modified or abandoned, mantra recitation is maintained. One result of ritual activity is that, through mantra recitation, a universe of language is constructed. Since mantras tend to lose their mean- ing, or are meaningless to begin with, this is a meaningless, and therefore mysterious, universe. It results from each of the Vedic rituals. Take for example the construction of a large altar from bricks, as we find it in the Agnicayana. This construction is effected, not by the mere deposition of bricks, but by the recitation of mantras which accompanies the 10</page><page sequence="11">STAAL: Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language deposition of each brick. This explains such state- ments as we find in the Satapatha Brahmana (9.1.2.17): "This fire altar is language, for it is piled up with language." Though the historical background is different, there is a Judaic parallel. After the destruction of the temple, the sacrifices were replaced by prayers, viz., language. In the Agnicayana, language can also replace ritual, but even when the rites are performed, their ritual essence is expressed by mantras. The altar construc- tion is a language-generating device. It does at any rate not confound language. The bricks, incidentally, are wish-bricks. Their name, i.taka, is not confined to bricks (as the dictionaries have it), but applies to various things: a piece of gold (hira.nyeStaka), a pot (kumbhe.taka) and all kinds of pebbles.67 The term istaka may therefore be derived from the root i4, "desire," not from yaj, "perform ritual," like isti, for example. It is Indo-European and certainly not Dravidian.68 When the altar is completed, the Yaja- mana or patron of the ritual recites: "Agni, may these bricks be cows for me, full of glory, giving the milk of desire in the other world."69 Throughout the history of Indian speculations on language we find, together with the linguistic and philosophical analysis, the larger units of speech emphasized. In the ritual philosophy of MImamsa, the Vedic mantras are interpreted as injunctions which prompt ritual action. On analysis, this prompting is attributed to the injunctive force which resides in each sentence in the verbal ending of the main verb.70 In later Mimamrsa we find, by the side of the Kumarila Bhatta view that the meaning of a sentence is the combination of the meanings of its constituent words (abhihitanvaya), the more interesting view of Pra- bhakara Guru that the meaning of a sentence is a function of the combination of its words taken to- gether as a unit (anvitabhidhana). The latter view implies that words convey no meaning except in the context of a sentence. The followers of Prabhakara argued for this view by drawing attention to the way children learn language: they first learn the meaning of larger expressions from the context or situation, and later arrive at the meaning of individual words by distributional analysis and abstraction (note that ex- plicit teaching is not mentioned which contrasts with the Midrash and is in accordance with Augustine and with the small part it actually plays in language learning71). And finally, in the most famous meta- physic of language, propounded by Bhartrhari in the Vakyapadtya (5th century A.D.), the main emphasis is again on the meaning of the undivided sentence (akhanda-vakya-sphota). What, then, of the origin of language? Once more I may have to disappoint you, at least if your tastes run empiricist. Not that the Indians did not consider the problem. On the contrary, according to the tradition I have so far considered, language has no origin: it is eternal. This is another way of saying that the Vedas are eternal, for they are the embodiment of language and no other language is ever seriously considered. This view seems to involve a confusion between language as an infinite system and a finite corpus of language-a distinction the Sanskrit grammarians maintained. But since the Vedic corpus is eternal and generally regarded as infinite, the distinction is blurred. While universes come and go, as do gods, men, and other things, the Vedas remain. The contemporary Indian philosopher T. R. V. Murti has rightly com- pared this doctrine of the eternity of language (sabda- nityatva) to the Platonic theory of forms or ideas.72 The Vedas, for example, according to Mimamsa, provide direct knowledge. All other knowledge is derived and of the form of memory.73 The doctrine of the eternity of language does of course presuppose that meaning is an essential part of language. It is likely that this doctrine led to the discovery of recursiveness just as, in the West, the idea of an infinity of natural numbers led to the discovery of mathematical induc- tion. In general, grammar is to India what mathematics is to the West.74 There are numerous Indian myths which show that the universe comes from language, or at least the mouth. Here is a poetic version in the new translation by Merwin and Masson: Krishna went out to play Mother and he ate dirt Is that true Krishna No who said it Your brother Balarama Not true Look at my face Open your mouth he opened it and she stood speechless inside was the universe may he protect you.75 11</page><page sequence="12">Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.1 (1979) There is a minority view in India which is pro- pounded in the rival tradition of early Buddhism and the materialistic school of Carvaka. It neglects mean- ing, is empiricist, behavioristic and atomistic, and holds that language is arbitrary and conventional. This doctrine, which is more plausible within the limited perspective of common sense, is also linguistically less adequate. I have already pointed out that this view enabled Buddhism to travel beyond the frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. Now you also know why this could not have happened to Hinduism, which was held back by its Mimamsa scruples. Our final topic is names in India. In Mimamsa, they are recognized, but subordinated to injunctions. Else- where, they also play a relatively subordinate role, though there are exceptions of various kinds. In Indian philosophy, a general expression for the empirical world is: the world of name and form (ndmarapa). In the Upanisads we frequently meet with the phrase nama eva, "names only." The best example occurs in the seventh chapter of the Chandogya Upani$ad (sixth century B.C.?). The seer Narada approaches a great sage called "Perpetual Youth" (Sanatkumara), and requests instruction. Perpetual Youth asks him what he knows already, and Narada answers: "Sir, I know the .Rgveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda, the Atharvaveda which is the fourth, the epics and legends which are the fifth, the Veda of Vedas (i.e., grammar), the ancestral rites, calculus, divination, chronology, logic, good manners, etymology, the science of Brahman, the science of demons, archery, astronomy, serpentology and fine arts."-"All you have enumer- ated," says Perpetual Youth, "is names only." And then he takes him up the metaphysic winding stairs of a cosmic hierarchy: and shows him that, beyond names, there is language; beyond language, spirit; beyond spirit, thought; beyond thought, reason; and further beyond, reflection, science, force, food, water, fire, space, memory, hope, life; and after more meanderings, Perpetual Youth introduces him to the Infinite, where I propose to leave him, and also you. At the end of our Oriental tour I am not in a position to offer a single conclusion which throws direct light on the origin of language. However, we have at least learned negatively that no theory which confines itself to naming is in a position to explain the origin of language. We have to start with grammatical structure. Beyond that I have a conclusion which is indirectly relevant: in the absense of any solid knowledge on the subject-an absence solidly confirmed by the New York conference to which I referred at the beginning of my talk-legends and myths are as serious as so-called serious speculation. Not only philosophy-even ritual can be illuminating, as we have seen. As for ritual, there is a widespread but erroneous view, that rites re- enact myths. We do know something much less general: during the European middle ages, many biblical episodes provided inspiration and material for miracle plays. What would count, you may ask, as the most dramatic ritual enactment of the legend of the tower of Babel? From among numerous suitable candidates I would unhesitatingly select the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society. I have initiated our miracle play by aiming at the sky and speaking in one language. You may now disperse, confound your speech and become unintelligible to each other. REFERENCES Aarsleff, H.
