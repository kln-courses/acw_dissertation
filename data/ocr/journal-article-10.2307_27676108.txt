<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rolf J. Goebel University of Alabama in Huntsville Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden: Official Urban Discourse and Durs Gr?nbein's Poetic Critique1 i In recent years, Dresden, after Berlin and Leipzig the third largest city in the neue L?nder and the capital of the State of Saxony, has emerged as a particu larly important site of cultural negotiation. In its palimpsest-like topogra phy,2 the auratic reconstruction of classical monuments promotes the visual enactment of collective memory as a motivating force for post-reunification identity formation in a media-saturated capitalist consumer culture. In this sense, the Eastern German city has emerged as a formidable counterweight to the centrality of Berlin. Often the old/new capital is assumed to be representa tive of the entire nation, labeled the "Berlin Republic," and its quest for "nor malization" after the Holocaust, World War II, and the East-West division.3 However, as Lutz Koepnick has stressed, Berlin's importance must not be allowed to stifle the critical investigation of the "profoundly federalist and creatively decentered traditions of German urban culture," as well as the "local textures and regional memories of other German areas" ("Forget" 351). In this context, Dresden's cultural significance after Germany's reunification, I propose, comes into sharp relief through a cultural studies reading that jux taposes the city's material culture and its discursive self-representation on the one hand with the poetry of Durs Gr?nbein on the other. Gr?nbein was born in Dresden on 9 October 1962 and he is the best known commentator on the historical topography of the city. As I will show, in the official city discourse, the recent reconstruction of the Baroque Frauenkirche serves as the m?tonymie sign of the city's vision of restored aesthetic totality, reflective of an understandable desire for a redemptive recovery from traumatic historical legacies: the almost complete destruction by World War II allied bombings during the night of 13-14 February 1945, followed by the architectural func tionalism of the GDR's planning policies, which sought to rebuild Dresden as a socialist model city4 Dresden's new self-stylization imaginatively employs the Wagnerian concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk to legitimate its post-reuni fication recovery in ways that seek public support on a national and inter The German Quarterly 80.4 (Fall 2007) 492</page><page sequence="2">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 493 national scale, but in so doing endorses an understanding of the past that dif fers significantly from Gr?nbein's own ironic poetry on Dresden. The writer does not celebrate an Aufhebung of disastrous history?its simultaneous pres ervation and transfiguration?in the city's presumably redemptive meta physics of authentically restored beauty. Instead, Gr?nbein's post-reunifi cation texts conceptualize Dresden as an unreal spectacle and an irreparably ruined work of art, where the irrepressible but unredeemable traces of the fragmented past reject complacent historical commemoration and nostalgic desires, while forcing the remembering subject to reflect upon his own histori cal belatedness. Seen together in this way, official city discourse and individ ual poetic voice compete with one another to provide the public sphere with a conceptualization of Dresden that refuses to be totalized into a seamless narrative or hypostatized as the essential truth. Instead, this representational collage of heterogeneous voices and subject positions alerts us to the problem of functionalizing a traumatic past, incompletely coped with, for Dresden's future aspirations as a cultural metropolis in Eastern Germany and in the New Europe. II Restoring East Germany's endangered landmarks, as Jason James has argued, represents "a kind of redemptive labor. That is, it serves as a means of compensating for and undoing the damage inflicted on national culture over a sixty-year period marked by fascism, war, national division, and state social ism" ("Recovering" 144). In the case of Dresden, the symbolic value of urban recovery received international confirmation in 2004, when the city and the surrounding Elbe Valley were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.5 Since 1994, the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche has attracted particularly widespread media attention. Designed by George Bahr, the original church was completed on 27 May 1743. It collapsed on 15 February 1945, having suf fered extensive fire and heat damage after the air raids. The rebuilt church was dedicated on 30 October 2005 and has since become one of the Germany's most celebrated cultural attractions, just in time for Dresden's celebration of its 800th anniversary in 2006. On this occasion the city portrayed itself as a European cultural metropolis, linking its glorious past as the Baroque residen tial capital of August der Starke with the technological innovations and eco nomic strength of late or postindustrial consumer capitalism. It regards its history as a continuous scenario of ruins from which, phoenix-like, it has always produced its own vision of redemptive resurrection: "Machtwechsel und Kriege haben die Stadt mehr als einmal zerst?rt, oft ist auf den Tr?mmern etwas zukunftsweisend Neues entstanden" {Zeit f?r Dresden).</page><page sequence="3">494 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 In the popular imagination, Dresden is known as the Elbflorenz and as an urban Gesamtkunstwerk. Especially the latter designation has become some thing of a conceptual master topos for the city, raising important questions pertaining to the symbolic inscription of (inter-)national identity and histori cal memory in the city's architectural recovery. The Gesamtkunstwerk topos evokes Richard Wagner's programmatic reflections on the "Kunstwerk der Zukunft" (1849) and other writings. For the composer, the future work of art, attaining its fullest realization in drama, constitutes the perfect reunification of all individual artistic genres, especially orchestral music, mimic dance, and poetry; only through this mutually illuminating collaboration are these art forms able to communicate their own specific intentions fully and directly to the audience, assembled publicly in the congenially designed theatre. The collective nature of the total work of art corresponds to Wagner's idea that the artist of the future is not the individual poet, actor, musician or sculptor, but the Volk itself, understood as a collectivity arising from the depth of true human nature and its emancipatory impulses (154). As Andreas Huyssen has pointed out, Wagner's architecturally inspired aesthetics rests on his critique of capitalism as a corrupt and decadent ideology of modernity. The com poser's redemptive vision of the monumental future work of art is predicated on a world in ruins and a history of decay, ranging from the dissolution of the Athenian State, of Greek tragedy, and of the Grand Opera, to evocations of heroic downfall, mythic sacrifice, and death ("Faszination" 291-97). Huyssen embeds his review of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk concept and its affinity with Albert Speer 's Ruinenwerttheorie into a critical survey of Ger many's post-reunification fascination with monumental and anti-monu mentalist discourses, its desire for redemption from history and memory, and the redefinition of the monumental as an aesthetic of transitoriness as exem plified in the public commemoration in Christo's Wrapping of the Reichstag. Extending Huyssen's suggestive readings into the immediate present, I argue that Wagner's concept possesses a particular aura, a quasi-mythic authority coupled with a popularized media-image of the composer's original inten tions, which enable the Gesamtkunstwerk topos to be redeployed in various le gitimating ways by Germany's collective imagination. This imaginative re-utilization includes Dresden's post-unification topography, where it func tions as a conceptual framework promising historical redemption from the ruined past through the auratic sublimity of classical architectural beauty, relying on the harmonious integration of the arts and surrounding landscape in a reconstructed historic city panorama that hides or transfigures the signs of socialist architecture and capitalist consumer modernity. Used for the first time in the 1920s by Paul Wolf, Dresden's Stadtbaurat from 1923-45 (Heiz Kraftwerk), the term seeks to capture the city's unique synthesis of urban architecture, surrounding landscape, and historical heritage; at the same time, it is not merely an aesthetic concept but resonates with larger ideological</page><page sequence="4">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 495 subtexts. Organized by the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden and the Stiftung Frauenkirche from 29 October 2005 to 1 May 2006, an exhibition named "Der Blick auf Dresden: Die Frauenkirche und das Werden der Dresdner Stadtsilhouette" honors "das 'Kernst?ck' des Weltkulturerbes Eib tal, dieses einzigartige Gesamtkunstwerk aus Architektur und Flussland schaft im Herzen Dresdens" (Milbradt 7). As essays in the exhibition's com panion volume make clear, the aestheticizing effect of Dresden's totalizing visual spectacle is the result of specific topographical factors collaborating with the historically changing reproducibility of the city in diverse media, such as paintings, photography, and travel literature. The famous paintings of the Venetian artist Bernardo Bellotto, known as Canaletto, from the mid 18th century were especially important in creating a sublime image of Dresden, where landmarks like Augustusbr?cke, Hofkirche (now Kathedrale St. Trinitatis) and the dome of the Frauenkirche contribute to "die Vorstellung der vollkommenen Stadt" (Pla?meyer 11). According to J?rgen Paul, when seen from the distance, Dresden appears as a "Vision," whereas from nearby it resembles an "erhabene Kulisse ?ber der B?hnenrampe der Br?hischen Ter rasse und der steinern gefassten Uferkanten" (22). This theatrical mirage effect, it may be added, is keenly felt by anyone who, after enjoying the unde niable beauty of the seemingly unified panorama from the opposite side of the Elbe, must discover that the Gesamtkunstwerk topos at best refers only to the Inner Old Town. Its relatively small area sharply contrasts with nearby venues such as the GDR Kulturpalast or the Prager Stra?e, which was de stroyed in the war and later rebuilt as a vast public space in the style of socialist functionalism, only to be refurbished in Western capitalist consumer fashion after reunification. The visual spectacle of Dresden as a Gesamtkunstwerk is not merely the effect of material topography and visual medialization; rather, it is directly related to larger issues of history and commemoration. Gilbert Lupf er stresses that, in the city's collective memory, the night of the air raids appears as the epitome of destruction: "Eine ?ber Jahrhunderte gewachsene und dabei zum einzigartigen Gesamtkunstwerk gewordene Stadtanlage ... war ?ber Nacht vernichtet worden" ("Zerst?rung" 127). This event, which Lupf er identifies as the origins of the "myth of Dresden," came to be understood as a singularly traumatic catastrophe victimizing an unprepared and politically innocent center of culture ("Zerst?rung" 130). Without belittling the material devasta tion and human loss during the bombing, Lupfer points out that destruction has always been an integral part of Dresden's past: the Seven Years War and earlier military conflicts, epidemics, fires, the demolition of salvageable ruins after World War II, and the politics of socialist urban planning all left their marks on the city ("Zerst?rung" 131-35). Lupfer proposes that the emotion ally understandable but historically inaccurate stylization of the 1945 air raids as a singularly disruptive trauma accounts for the city's desire to heal its</page><page sequence="5">496 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 wounds, even by superficial means, and for its sometimes pursuing an ideal ized past. The rebuilding of the presumably historical Neumarkt around the Frauenkirche, for instance, amounts to a "Geschichtsklitterei" leading to the ahistorical rebuilding of the Hotel de Saxe, which had already been torn down in 1888 and thus has nothing to do with the city's evocation of the events of 1945 ("Zerst?rung" 130). In these essays, Wagner's vision of a perfect artistic synthesis corresponds to Dresden's equally monumental totalization of architectural beauty, its ideal natural surroundings, and its historical significance. While Wagner's drama arises from the ruins of ancient culture, Dresden re-emerges from the singularly traumatic ruins of World War II and from the banal modernism of GDR urban politics. Even the composer's mythic postulate of the Volk as the true origin of future art reappears in its modern, rationalized form in the idea that Dresden is the Heimat of many committed citizens actively contributing to the city's centrality in the arts, the sciences, and the economy (Zeit f?r Dresden). The crucial difference, however, is that for Wagner, the total work of art is decidedly a program for the future, whereas Dresden's Gesamtkunstwerk professes to encompass the past and the future in the fulfilled reality of post-reunification Germany. This temporal transposition from Wagner's futuristic vision to the actuality of the here and now strengthens the claim that Dresden's artistic renewal is an undeniable fact, that its spectacular appearance expresses not merely certain nostalgic desires and illusory hopes for the future but articulates an almost metaphysical kind of urban truth for our time. Ill This metaphysical aura surrounding a sublimely theatricalized city pan orama may explain the wide range of meanings attributed to the rebuilt Frauenkirche, whose unique design?a montage of new elements with au thentic historical remnants?makes it an ideal metonymy for the entire city's Gesamtkunstwerk. Reconstructed through the use of traditional building tech niques, the edifice incorporates the ruins of the choir, the relatively well preserved Christ altar, and a significant amount of original stones, inserted as accurately as possible in their former positions. These authentic remnants find themselves in a functional building equipped with electric fixtures, a state-of-the art heating system, and other such technical concessions to our time, crowned by a large eclectic organ, built by the firm of Daniel Kern, Strasbourg, which includes the stop list of the original Silbermann instru ment. Currently, the old and blackened stones stand out in stark contrast to the light-yellow hues of the new building material, visually reminding the viewer of the paradox that the church's claims to historical authenticity,</page><page sequence="6">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 497 expressed in the program of a historically faithful reconstruction, can only be raised within the technological and conceptual framework of a thoroughly contemporary replica that recreates a lost original for use in the postmodern age of image reduplications and media simulations.6 Even though the sand stone from the Elbe Valley is prone to environmental discoloration and will in the years to come probably no longer look as different from the old stones as it does now, this very process of color assimilation symbolizes the inevitable temporality of history that the building is meant to reflect in the first place. For the time being, the Frauenkirche's fa?ade and interior offer a striking contrast between old and new, reflecting a view of history as traces of a past that refuse denial or suppression of trauma and instead inscribe themselves in the present only in order to be threatened by decay, assimilation, and, poten tially, future disappearance/Thus, in true Wagnerian spirit, the Frauenkirche epitomizes the city's Gesamtkunstwerk ideology as a monumental vision of re demptive synthesis; its beautiful space of integrated artistic disciplines arises from a reflective inquiry into the temporality of historical decay and ruination which it simultaneously evokes and transfigures through the phantasmagoria of authentic reconstruction. In this sense, the Frauenkirche reconstruction is very different from earlier projects, such as the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged?chtnis kirche in Berlin and St Nikolai in Hamburg, which commemorate the disasters of World War II through a melancholic aesthetics of preserved ruins and an allegorical meditation on absence, rather than through the metaphysics of restored presence espoused by the Frauenkirche or by the plans for the rebuild ing of the Berlin Stadtschloss on the site of the demolished GDR Palast der Republik. Critics of the new Frauenkirche have often criticized its symbolism, some times in a one-sided manner. Susanne Vees-Gulani contends that it "wipes out not only the visible marks of the consequences of the war but also more than forty years of Socialism" (155), when the church's wartime ruins served as a memorial for the bombing victims and the struggle against imperialism, and later, from 1982, as a site where people lighted candles for peace and in protest against the GDR government. More dialectically, Jason James reads the reconstructed Frauenkirche as a "melancholic fantasy of reversing loss. The fantasy does not require one to forget loss or pretend it never occurred?only to believe that it can be reversed" ("Undoing" 249; see also James, "Recovering" 153-57). A careful reading of the complex official discourse, which ranges from her meneutic readings of architectural intentions and meanings to the arbitrary projections of ideological preoccupations, may partly correct these critiques.8 Perhaps no document represents this discursive diversity more clearly than the church reconstruction's promotional brochure, Der Wiederaufbau der Frauenkirche zu Dresden: Aufruf zur Mithilfe. Although Zwinger, Hofkirche, and Semperoper had already been rebuilt by the GDR, only the completed recon</page><page sequence="7">498 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 struction of the Frauenkirche, according to the brochure, seemed to restore the city panorama's "ganze Sch?nheit und harmonische Erhabenheit" (Wie deraufbau n.p.).The preface by Ludwig G?ttier, a renowned trumpet virtuoso and the chairman of the Gesellschaft zur F?rderung des Wiederaufbaus der Frauen kirche Dresden e.V., invests the materiality of the church's rubble and recon structed stone dome with a highly emotional anthropomorphic metaphysics in which architectural space attains the psychological self-identity of a hu man body recovering from traumatic injury: Die Tr?mmer der Dresdner Frauenkirche werden wieder in die "Steinerne Glo cke" verwandelt. Sie, die nicht nur Herz und Seele der Dresdner Altstadt war, sondern dar?ber hinaus st?dtebaulicher Ma?stab, ja Zentrum des zivilen Dres den, wird wiederaufgebaut werden. Als Wahrzeichen unserer Stadt ist die Frau enkirche f?r Dresdens wiederzugewinnende Identit?t unverzichtbar. Here, Guttler's hopes for urban renewal?perfectly understandable as a prominent voice articulating a basic human desire and right to recover from a life in ruins, physically and metaphorically?endow the church with an almost mythic aura, which far exceeds the original's historical importance as one of the most beautiful monuments of Central German Baroque architec ture. His position is typical of a larger collective discourse of official voices investing the material presence of the Frauenkirche with Utopian hopes testifying to Germany's aspirations towards "normalization." Contributing to a catalogue of "Gru?worte," former Chancellor Helmut Kohl regards the rebuilt church as a particularly meaningful symbol for peace and international understanding in the wake of wartime destruction, while for Saxony's former Ministerpr?sident Biedenkopf, the donations from all re gions and social strata of Germany indicate that since all of its people feel joy ful about the completion of the church, the psychological unification of Ger many has been accomplished. While the statements of Kohl and Biedenkopf reveal more about their authors' own hopes than about the building's intrinsic characteristics, other voices attempt to read the church more closely in specifi cally theological and moral terms. For Volker Kre?, Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the State of Saxony, the Frauenkirche offers the "Predigt ihrer Steine" as a site of spiritual reflection and reconciliation, building a bridge from the past to a peaceful future. Former Bishop Johannes Hempel argues that the church's rubble buried itself as a "Kainsmal menschlicher Schuld" deeply into the collective psyche of the postwar period, and as an open wound admonished the people never again to allow the fury of wars to be unleashed; the church's reconstruction, however, also reminds people of the biblical message to heal wounds instead of keeping them open. Hartmut Rau, Superintendent of Dresden-Mitte, speaks of the "erkl?rter Wille, das Gottes haus in seiner Urspr?nglichkeit wiedererstehen zu lassen." The church will be a site for silent reflection, human contact, and commemoration, promoting reconciliation, peace, and a genuinely new beginning inspired by the example</page><page sequence="8">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 499 of God's love for his people. This kind of theological hermeneutics is anchored in a language of authenticity that conceptualizes the reappearance of the church in its original state by alluding to the risen Christ, while neglecting the fact that the new Frauenkirche is, after all, the copy of a long-lost original. Whereas these and other voices stress healing and recuperation, elsewhere in the Wiederaufbau brochure Dresden's ruined history appears not so much as a burden of the past to be reversed or undone than as a significant legacy to be preserved, reframed, and redefined through the public process of planning, promoting, and executing the church's reconstruction. Thus, the brochure combines several large-scale paintings and photographs of Dresden's classical vistas before the war with dramatic panorama and close-up shots of the ruins from 1945-49, supplemented by documentary pictures of the recent develop ments at the Frauenkirche reconstruction site. Textual comments, too, incor porate explicit references to war and destruction into the vision of the city's re-emerging Gesamtkunstwerk. The brochure specifically recalls that the pres ervation of valuable pieces of Frauenkirche rubble had already begun in 1947, followed in 1949 by plans for an "archeological reconstruction," i.e., for a historically accurate rebuilding. Although economic and political reasons prevented the GDR from carrying out such plans, preservationist activity protected the ruins from being removed totally by the State (see also Lerm). The text evokes the ruins and the enormous pile of rubble as an "ersch?ttern des Denkmal f?r die Erfahrung, da? Kriege nur Leid und Zerst?rung ?ber die Menschen und ihre Kultur bringen," and explicitly recalls that this experience motivated the annual commemorative and political protest meetings at the Frauenkirche ruin. The decision to reconstruct the church means "kein Aus weichen vor der Geschichte"; rather, the Frauenkirche will not only be a work of art of unique beauty but also a "Geschichtsdenkmal" for Baroque Dresden and for the courage to rebuild the city from its rubble. As these statements suggest, the Frauenkirche and Dresden's other recon struction projects do not advocate either a triumphalist erasure of painful memories by the timeless present or an imaginary reversal of past disasters and loss. Rather, I believe, the official view of Dresden as Gesamtkunstwerk must wrestle with the more complicated question of how to reconcile two entirely different agendas, which relate to Wagner's idea that the musical Gesamt kunstwerk's monumentality is directly connected to an imaginative evocation of destruction and rubble (Huyssen, "Faszination" 295). For on the one hand, the redemptive power of Dresden's panorama is celebrated as restoring the city's historic authenticity and metaphysical identity (the splendors of the Baroque Elbflorenz); on the other hand, the same urban ensemble is given the task of securing space for the commemoration of subsequent historical disas ters (World War II and GDR city planning) that irreversibly destroyed much of this idealized past. Thus, temporally and spatially, collective awareness of the brutal facts of political destruction competes with the beautiful semblance of</page><page sequence="9">500 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 architectural reconstruction, undermining its function of restoring inter rupted traditions through the projection of sublime harmony and organic wholeness. This problem of representing asynchronous and opposing chap ters of national history through the same architectural signifiers is particu larly visible in the Frauenkirche: claimed to be a self-conscious replica restor ing the original's authenticity, its montage of old and new elements is simul taneously supposed to preserve the memory of catastrophic events and to transfigure or heal their traumatic effects. IV Nowhere can we reflect on the contradictions and instabilities of Dres den's Gesamtkunstwerk more intriguingly than in Gr?nbein's own, independ ent poetic representation of this topos. Certainly, he is not necessarily repre sentative of the enormous range of poetic voices addressing Dresden's fate or even a particularly authoritative spokesman for the city's history. But, as Renatus Deckert has pointed out, while other prominent writers?Heinz Czechowski, Karl Mickel, B.K. Tragelehn, and Volker Braun?witnessed the destruction of their city first-hand and preserved this trauma in their memory as an essential factor of identity-formation, the younger Gr?nbein conceives of Dresden's ruination as something unattainably remote (Deckert 242).9 These positions of historical posterity and conceptual distance lend Gr?n bein's texts a particularly critical perspective that sharply contrasts with the aura of visual and temporal presence surrounding the Gesamtkunstwerk con ception of Dresden and hence can be profitably employed to add interpretive aspects not attainable through an immanent analysis of official discourse itself. The poet's distance from Dresden's destruction and past as a classical work of art is connected to what Amir Eshel has called the "post-historicist" position of Gr?nbein and other poets, who display "a resistance to any over reaching sense presumably concealed in history, a farewell altogether to his tory as an ultimate narrative entailing moral lessons or implying political im peratives" (409). This distrust is the precondition for Gr?nbein's non-subjec tivistic physiological "memory machine" (410), which records the disparate images of the collective cultural archive through the "poetic figuration of simultaneously existing and moving time layers" (411). Eshel's remarks are helpful in defining the relation between Gr?nbein's writings and Dresden's official self-representation. His poetry since the fall of the Berlin Wall and Germany's reunification cannot be reduced to a mimetic depiction of specific instances of the city's architectural reconstructions, some of which postdate the publication of his texts, nor can it be seen simply as a critical anticipation of later developments in the city's self-repre sentation. Rather, I suggest that the semantic richness of his vocabulary of</page><page sequence="10">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 501 urban space?replete with cryptic allusions, philosophical reflections, polem ical rhetoric, etc.?allows his texts to be recontextualized, displaced, and ac tualized beyond their original intentions in new hermeneutic constellations with other discourses such as the collective propagation of the Gesamtkunst werk topos. Gr?nbein's poetry shares with Dresden's public discourse an aestheticizing preoccupation with urban memory inscribed in topographical space, but it re-assembles the dispersed shards of historical ruination without integrating them into a historical meta-narrative with a political telos or moral message. I do not propose that Gr?nbein's writings directly intervene in Dresden's Utopian vision of reuniting the fragmented past in the redemptive wholeness of architectural reconstruction; the writer's adherence to the classical notion of poetic autonomy would resist such functionalist employ ment of his texts. Rather, I argue that Gr?nbein's voice can be read as a supple mentary and often subversive alternative to Dresden's official discourse, enabling the reader to reflect on Dresden's topography in the intermedial space of cultural criticism that encompasses but also transcends these differ ent modes of conceptualizing urban memory and renewal. In an interview with Renatus Deckert, conducted on 15 March 2002, the poet speculates that Dresden must once have epitomized the citt? ideale of the Renaissance, only to suffer total loss in the twentieth century. For Gr?nbein and his generation, this tension provided the conceptual basis from which to remember and write the city. While no modern society will ever again invest so much effort in the art of urban representation, Gr?nbein believes it is the task of the belated artist to retrieve at least some of the fragments of these bygone representations and to try to put them together again. He is careful to suggest, however, that this project remains awkward and incomplete, even while perhaps explaining a certain frivolous sense of poetic beauty ("Auch Dresden"). In his essay "Chim?re Dresden" (1995), Gr?nbein perceives the city as a quasi-cinematic and dreamlike phantasmagoria. Already in his youth, the alienated and melancholic writer experienced Dresden as a drab and boring place; the city appeared to be a technically flawed archival film, badly cut and clumsily synchronized (145). Returning to Dresden after Germany's reunifi cation, the writer is amazed at the euphoric pursuit of the new, which seems to disregard the ruins while busily pursuing restorations and new construc tion projects (149-50). The widespread erasure of socialist urban culture, most visible in the renaming of streets and squares, creates the impression that the city simply wants to reconnect to its legendary past so violently brought to a temporary standstill by World War IL As a result of this apparent repression of the immediate but discomforting past, Dresden's reconstruction plans turn the city into "urbane Traumbilder " which confound the linearity of time: "Plusquamperfekt und Futur schieben sich verkehrt ineinander, mit dem Pr?sens gleitet die Gegenwart an restaurierten Fassaden ab" (150). Like a</page><page sequence="11">502 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 documentary war movie rapidly played backwards, stones and walls are miraculously restored to their seemingly old position. Only in Dresden (and perhaps in the United States), Gr?nbein remarks ironically, can one pursue the old fairytale wish for a new Frauenkirche: "Animation, das ist hier gleichzeitig der Zaubertrick am Computer wie die Belebung der Steine aus dem Geist des Lokalpatriotismus" (150-51). Other magnificent cities also suf fered tragic loss and destruction but, as the poet claims, no other city culti vated its remembrance of the time before its destruction and the phantom image of its metropolitan silhouette as nostalgically as Dresden (151). Although Gr?nbein's polemic seems to miss Dresden's visually striking attempts to reframe the painful past, rather than deny or reverse its uncom fortable legacy, his way of recasting the city in the language of film and of digital-age manipulation effectively serves to critique the urban Gesamt kunstwerk's reliance on authenticity and metaphysical presence. Dresden's strategy of urban reauratization10 is radically undermined by Gr?nbein's "Gedicht ?ber Dresden"; although published in 1991, when the city's post Wende reconstruction efforts had barely begun, the text attains fresh signifi cance in light of their present proliferation. In Gr?nbein's poem, the trauma tized and fragmented city figures as a "Scheintote Stadt" and a "Barockwrack an der Elbe," as an enigmatic image whose beautiful silhouette seeks in vain to hide the depressive genius loci of bad memory. For Gr?nbein, the zombie-like irreality and disjointed wreckage of Dresden undermine the desire to see the city as a harmonious totality in which the past can at the same time be preserved and made whole again. If history re-appears as art, it does so in its worst imaginable version, as the perverse politicization of classical monu mentality: "Auch Dresden ist ein Werk des Malerlehrlings / Mit dem in Wien verst?mperten Talent / Der halb Europa seinen Stilbruch aufzwang." Hitler's pseudo-artistic megalomania is seen as the root of the equally disastrous craftsmanship of the Allies' military intervention, the "Technik fl?chen deckender Radierung / Durch fremde Bomber" carried out by "Meister ihres Fachs / In einer Nacht mit schwarzem Schnee im Februar." This fateful conti nuity in the false art of technocratic modernity sends the poet's memory back to Hitler's chief architect. According to David Clay Large, Albert Speer, en couraged by his boss's sentimental Romanticism, advocated a "'theory of ruin value,' according to which all Nazi buildings should be constructed with ma terials and techniques that would make them look as noble as ancient Roman or Greek ruins when they themselves fell into decay in the distant future" (304). In his poem, Gr?nbein alludes to this morbid aestheticism: Getreu den Pl?nen seines [Hitler's] Kunstfreunds Speer ("Die Zukunft, Albert!") bleibt von Bausubstanzen Nach Tausend Jahren noch, gro? im Verfall Die Sch?nheit der Ruinen, ihr Ruinenwert.</page><page sequence="12">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 503 The Fascists' appropriation of the Romantic fascination with ruins liter ally buries the classical notion of Dresden as an aesthetic totality under its political rubble. The present era can still hear the musical voice of this work of art but, contrary to the city's official discourse, no longer apprehends its ma terial visibility: "So praktisch kommt Romantik in der Hand / Von Ingenieu ren. Ein Gesamtkunstwerk/ Singt unter Tr?mmern noch inh?chsten T?nen." Whereas the Wiederaufbau brochure treats World War II as a historical past inscribed in Dresden's old/new urban Gesamtkunstwerk, Gr?nbein's text sub ordinates this same artistic totality to the continued legacy of National Social ism and allied bombings.11 Their technocratic perversion of Romantic art, directly resulting in Dresden's irreparable destruction, relegates the ideal of an urban Gesamtkunstwerk irretrievably to the past, thus countering official Dresden's promotion of the same ideal as something that can be rescued through contemporary technologies of archeological reconstruction. If ever present historical catastrophe?and not restored city aesthetics?proves to be the dominant frame of commemorative efforts, then the newly reconstructed city, its material actuality and symbolic significance notwithstanding, proves incapable of redeeming the traumatic past. The poem does not envision the chance for a standstill of history through the progressive linkage of the ful filled present to the past and future, as Dresden's official discourse suggests; only in some unspecified future perfect can there be some kind of recon ciliatory relief from the ruinous vicissitudes of temporality: "Im Futur II wird alles still geworden sein." Contrary to the official discourse on Dresden, which maintains that his torically authentic reconstruction facilitates genuine memory and the preser vation of historical legacy, Gr?nbein, in his poetry cycle "Europa nach dem letzten Regen" (1996),12 maintains that the ruined city is marked by an ulti mately irretrievable pastness, which no commemorative effort can ever fully retrieve. In this sense, Eshel's description of the poet's treatment of Dresden as a "topographic-mnemonic site encoding the European and human conditions in the twentieth century" (412) needs to be qualified; perhaps it would be better to characterize Gr?nbein's city as a site where topography, paradoxi cally, contains the ruined traces of various historical chapters while question ing the poet's very ability to re-present ("encode") the past despite his com memorative efforts.13 "Raumlos, Erinnerung... und keine Stadt, /An die man sich, heimkehrend, halten kann" (section 1,143), muses the poetic voice; this spatial void is linked to the insurmountable temporal distance between past and present: "Dresden ist lange her ..."; once a Baroque "Festsaal gestern," it later became a "Nachruf im Bericht des deutschen Heers," parenthetically re ferred to as a phantom-like simulacrum: "(Im Anflug ein Las Vegas an der Elbe)" (section II, 144). Here Gr?nbein alludes to charges that Dresden may re semble the commercialized artificiality of that American city or even turn into a "Baroque Disneyland," nostalgically reinventing an imaginary and</page><page sequence="13">504 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 idealized past.14 But the difficulty of commemorating the city is not merely a result of the city's pastness and simulations; it is also caused by the belated ness of poetic language itself. The poet suggests that linguistic signifiers can never fully catch up with lost historical references; instead of evoking remem bered sights and events, language defers them infinitely, since words can only call, but not recall, the past: "Denn das Wort kommt zu sp?t, das sie ruft, / Die am Stadtrand begrabene Stadt." Ironically, despite decades of preservation and reconstruction efforts, Dresden perpetually recedes further into its (real and symbolic) heaps of wartime rubble: "Unter Schuttbergen sinkt, unter Null, alles Gestern / Aus Terrassen und Kuppeln, barocker Bau." Not the im ages of bygone architectural space but only the symbolic voices from the bur ied past can be discerned in the present; represented by one of its most famous landmarks, the ancestor gallery of the Wettiner dynasty at the city palace, the city "lebt weiter im Fl?stern, in Ger?chten aus Stein, / Die von F?rstenzug handeln" (section III, 145). For a dramatically alternative version of the end of World War II, Gr?nbein explores the possibility that the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima may originally have been intended for Dresden. The poet's aestheticism trans forms Dresden's ancient Gesamtkunstwerk splendor into the horrific but visually striking effects and operatic pathos of modern atomic annihilation. Actualizing the mythic obsession with death, decay, and downfall in Wag ner's music drama, the poet pushes the concept radically to a final point where emotionally overwhelming beauty and cataclysmic magnificence, especially when revealed as the spectacularization of brutal power politics, appear to tally divorced from humanizing function and moral imperatives traditionally associated with the redemptive nature of the classical work of art. Atomic destruction here appears as the technologically advanced finalization of the Baroque obsession with large-scale theatrical effects allegorizing the vanity and evanescence of all human ambitions: Der Riesenpilz, die weltber?hmte Abschiedsgeste Der alten Opernhimmel. Wieviel sch?ner W?re der strahlende Bovist hier aufgebl?ht ?ber der sandsteinhellen Residenz als Kr?nung Barocker Baukunst. Aufs Gem?t Schl?gt die Vision, wie stilvoll hier die legend?re Finale Wolke aufgegangen w?re, (section VII, 149)15 Here, as elsewhere in his poetry, Gr?nbein's post-Wagnerian preoccupation with ruins and decay can be seen as the reverse side of Dresden's positive Gesamtkunstwerk concept. Both aestheticize the ravaged city and catastrophic history but endow it with starkly divergent ideological and emotional associa tions, pitting the reconciliatory vision of reconstructed urban beauty against the poet's ironic displacement of the beautiful as a category of nuclear destruc</page><page sequence="14">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 505 tion that may have totally obliterated even those few classical edifices that "conventional" bombings damaged without completely erasing them. This difference is also reflected in his poetry cycle Porzellan: Poem vom Untergang meiner Stadt, written between 1992 and 2005, where the writer accepts his biographical belatedness and historical distance from the city of his birth without nostalgia and even without elegiac sentiments. While com memoration often entails the mournful pondering of loss, the contemplation of beautiful ruins, or the regressive desire to idealize an apparently ever-lasting past, Gr?nbein's cynical interrogation of Dresden's history unmasks the horrific banality of material destruction behind the suffering and human toll. Thus, a daily and comparatively trivial event like an opera performance is bru tally disrupted by the apocalyptic spectacle outside the theatre: "Stell dir vor: es hat / Eine Opernpause nur gedauert, Zeit zum Zigarettenholen, / Und auf Stra?en, Todesfallen, brodelte der Teer" (3).16 Even the Kristallnacht, con trasted with the smashing of fine porcelain from the nearby Meissen manu facture, figures, rather disturbingly, as a terrible joke of history: Nein, kein Polterabend war, was Volkes spitze Zungen Die Kristallnacht nannten, jener Gl?ckstag f?r die Glaser. Bis zum Aschermittwoch sp?ter war da nur ein Sprung. Narr und Nazi hatten, hei?a, ihren Heidenspa?. (4)17 Memory's tendency to transform history into spectacle coincides with mod ern mass media and their electronic reproduction of past images: "Stumm film: nachts im Fernsehn ist sie wieder unversehrt / Archiviert, die Stadt, und kann dich doch nicht tr?sten" (5). In the age of media-saturated image consumption, Gr?nbein allegorizes the damaged Frauenkirche?which had survived the fire bombings for two days before its collapse?as a feminine representation of heroic and unselfish endurance in the wake of ghostly hor rors (15). He recalls the "unverge?lich[e] " image of the toppled Martin Luther monument in the front of the ruined church?also reproduced in a documen tary photograph by the Wiederaufbau brochure?as a "Memento f?r den fast verge?nen Brand." Depicting the site's desolate atmosphere, the poem seems to evoke Baroque allegories of ruins as images of earthly transitoriness and death. But for Gr?nbein, the "wahre Schock" is not the church ruin itself, which he associates with the last of Luther's theses nailed to the door of the Wittenberg castle church, but the sheep grazing on the Frauenkirche site as if nothing had happened?a poignant image of natural innocence in the wake of human guilt (16). Significantly, Gr?nbein here refers to the church's finished reconstruction only in passing, in a brief epigraph to poem no. 15, as if to sug gest that the memory of the edifice's ruins can never be effaced by the pride in the new church, thus reversing the official discourse's celebration of the prog ress of history from wartime damage to post-reunification healing and repair.</page><page sequence="15">506 The German Quarterly Fall 2007 V As I have suggested, Gr?nbein's portrayal of Dresden as a quasi-cinematic phantasmagoria haunted by specters of the past that defy nostalgic commem oration can be read as a critical alternative to the city's Gesamtkunstwerk ter minology of reconstructive authenticity and redemptive history. Gr?nbein, though, gives us only half of Dresden's complex picture. The poet's insistence on the irrevocable pastness of the authentic Dresden and the city's unreal appearance today minimizes the reconstruction project's Utopian promise, expressed by the Wiederaufbau brochure's suggestion that the new Frauen kirche is a monument to the simultaneous commemoration of history and the "moralischen Willen der Gegenwart zu heilen, neu zu beginnen und die Zukunft zu gestalten." This programmatic statement articulates a serious attempt to actualize the meanings of the national past for future aspirations, which are not reducible either to nostalgic sentimentality or blind faith in historical progress. It would be mistaken, though, to assume that Gr?nbein's poetry and Dresden's official self-representation are simply opposed to each other; rather, each position is already partially inscribed in the other. Thus, Gr?nbein's insistence on classical Dresden's pastness and his aversion against nostalgia contain a dialectical moment that also refers to a vision of the future, even though it is different from that of official discourse. In his interview with Renatus Deckert, the poet remarks that he is fascinated by the enormous will power energizing the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche; this desire to go on liv ing, aesthetically and otherwise, feeds dialectically off a fundamental sense of loss. Gr?nbein also stresses that one cannot go back in time and that the losses of yesterday are the same ones that await us in the future. But the recognition of loss early in one's life, he continues, can be mobilized for a critical perspec tive on the ways in which this factual loss may avoid false sublimation in later periods of time : "Ich glaube, da? die Erfahrung von Verlusten, j e fr?her man sie macht, einen f?r Zukunftsideologien weniger anf?llig macht." He suggest that perhaps one needed to cope earlier in the process of growing up with the "Trauerarbeit um das Vergehen von Zeit, aber auch um das Vergehen von Raum, bebautem Raum," and he attributes this philosophy to a specific sense of "Dresdner Humor, in meinem Fall wohl eher Sarkasmus." Gr?nbein, then, shares with official Dresden a vision of the future inscribed in the evanescence and ruination of architectural space, but substitutes the city's trust in the redemptive promises of historical reconstruction by a more skeptical view. He employs memory and mourning not as therapeutic processes but as herme neutic frameworks for engaging in an imaginative dialogue with the dead in order to attain an ironic vantage point for, and in the future from which to look back onto, this "ausgepowerte Erde." As he summarizes this dialectical movement: "Man k?nnte also sagen, das elegische Bewu?tsein ist eine Investition in die Zukunft" (Gr?nbein, "Auch Dresden").</page><page sequence="16">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 507 The Wiederaufbau brochure in turn approaches the poet's skeptical view of the past because it, too, reveals a secret fear that the Frauenkirche project may amount to little more than a postmodern falsification of history. Referring to the initial reservations against the reconstruction, the text notes: "Darf man ein so zerst?rtes historisches Baudenkmal wiederaufbauen? Ist es ehrlich vor der Geschichte? Ist es k?nstlerisch m?glich? Soll man nicht eher die Ruine als 'offene Wunde,' als Denkmal und Mahnmal der dunklen Seite deutscher Geschichte erhalten?" These concerns suggest that the rebuilt church can only become a dialectical monument to a disturbingly dualistic history (the destruction of the Baroque past and its restoration) through the necessarily incomplete displacement or sublimation of the fears of aesthetic flaws and historical dishonesty. Admitting these self-doubts but incompletely coping with them, the church's self-image will forever be haunted by their uncanny return; no evocation of the Frauenkirche's stony presence can be repeated often enough to dispel the specters of destruction and historical simulacra. Thus, neither public discourse nor poetic critique can claim to articulate Dresden's full meaning; rather, each foregrounds self-reflexively what the other willfully or unconsciously neglects. While it is certainly impossible to retrieve the entire spectrum of a modern pluralistic society's responses to a topography like Dresden, specific publications like the Wiederaufbau brochure and Gr?nbein's poetry, although marked by ideological partiality and subjec tive bias, function like textual or pictorial monads, containing representative traces of collective meaning?itself diverse and contradictory?in the particu lar details of their signifying structures. In this sense, Dresden's importance as a cultural metropolis stems from the fact that its very incompleteness, its ruins and restorations, trigger an immensely rich and heated controversy in the public sphere?from city planners and politicians to artists and cultural critics?concerning issues that affect this city's local life but transcend its parameters: Germany's interrogation of its own history, its quest for national normalization, its negotiation of post-reunification differences between East and West, and its role in the European community in an age of globalization. In offering a stage for negotiating such national concerns, Dresden has effectively challenged the old/new capital Berlin's hegemonic centrality18 Whether and how the Gesamtkunstwerk an der Elbe can continue to be regarded as a metonymy of Gesamtdeutschland will remain one of the trickiest but also one of the most intriguing questions to be negotiated on Elbflorenz's continu ally changing topography.

For issues of architec tural preservation, rebuilding, and imitation raised by the new Frauenkirche, see also Vees-Gulani 151-56. 7 James sees this temporal process more negatively: "Will weathering reduce if not remove the contrast?... And even if the 'wound' remains visible in the new edifice, the church's recovered presence may overwhelm those elements that recall its destruc tion" ("Undoing" 257). 8 For facets of the public Frauenkirche debate, see also James, "Undoing" 254-59. On the distinction between hermeneutic and allegorical (i.e., arbitrarily projecting) readings of architecture, see Koepnick, "Forget Berlin" and the response by Goebel "Forget Hermeneutics?" 9 Deckert provides an insightful interpretation of Gr?nbein's Dresden poetry in general while Schmitz, '"Ausl?schung'" discusses Gr?nbein in the comprehensive con text of other textual representations of the city's fate since 1945 (284-89). 10 For a critique of resuscitating politically liberating versions of Benjamin's notion of aura in the context of postmodern visual culture, such as Christo's Wrapped Reichstag, see Koepnick, "Aura." 11 Deckert mentions Gr?nbein's reference to Wagner's concept but leaves its impli cations undeveloped (241). 12 Gr?nbein's title alludes to Max Ernst's painting "L'Europe apr?s la pluie II" (1940-42). Here the artist offers a surrealistically apocalyptic landscape where frag ments of urban space and organic matter, including allegorical human torsos, seem petrified into contorted rocks and coral reefs. See Bischoff 64-69 and Eshel 412. 13 See Eshel's otherwise instructive discussion of the poetry cycle's treatment of Dresden as the site of the "simultaneity of different time layers, different memories" (412-13). 14 See Vees-Gulani for a discussion of these charges (154-56). 15 See also Deckert 245. Gr?nbein's Berlin diary explores the possibility that the poet might not even exist had the atomic bomb been dropped on his "geliebten Dresden." Deckert argues that here, Gr?nbein's distance vis-?-vis the city of his birth</page><page sequence="18">GOEBEL: Gesamtkunstwerk Dresden and Gr?nbein's Critique 509 seems minimized, and that the elegiac view replaces the coldly detached gaze (Gr?nbein, Das erste Jahr 109-10; Deckert 246). 16 Numbers in parentheses refer to sections of Porzellan, which is not paginated. 17 See also Dorothea von Tome's negative review o?
