<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethics,Ethics, by Nicolai Hartmann, 3 vols., in the Library of Philosophy, ed. by Prof. J. H. Muirhead. (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1932.) (Issued first in German, 1926.) Nicolai Hartmann is the successor to Ernst Troeltsch in the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin. He is still in the full vigour of middle life and is a native of Riga, where he was born of German parentage at a time when Latvia was a province of Russia. His adolescent years and those of his early manhood were actually spent in Russia itself, where he studied medicine at Petrograd, but he finally took his degree in philosophy at Marburg. He is intimately acquainted</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 219 with the views of Husserl and Scheler, and when, in 1921, he published his first great philosophical work, it shewed him to have broken entirely with Neo-Kantianism and Idealism, and to have taken up a new line of ontological Realism. So much by way of introduction. The present treatise upon ethics was begun during the Great War. Hartmann during the winter of 1916-17, was a soldier on the Eastern Front, where, amid the roar of the Russian guns, he read and pondered upon Aristotle's ethics and a single volume of Nietszche, the only books he had with him. There are not a few who are hailing the present work in its three volumes as the most important general treatise upon ethics since the days of Aristotle. Time will shew whether this enthusiasm is justified—or premature. Certainly Dr Hartmann has provided a fresh approach to the general study of the subject, and few can doubt his qualifications to handle it. The new treatise, as will be seen, is in three parts. Volume I deals with moral phenomena, and after a general introduction proceeds to combat the essential teaching of Kant that the moral law, because it is discerned a priori, issues from reason, and is a self-legislation of the rational will. Against this view is set Plato's position that all values and ' the ought' constitute an objective realm of essences which man discovers a priori, but which no more emanate from reason than do the principles of mathematics and logic. Volume II is concerned with moral values in detail, and presents them as forming a complex and, as yet, imperfectly known system. The author maintains that there is not the sharp division between the lower and the higher values which some have held to exist, and shews to his satisfaction that the actualization of the non-moral and elementary values is a necessary condi tion for the actualization of the higher. He gives in outline the main features of the chief virtues, and ends with a chapter on metaphysical personalism in which he seems to adopt a standpoint somewhat similar to that of McTaggart when he says: ' In the full primary sense of the word, a person is and remains only the lower extreme, the individual subject, the man. The opposite extreme, the universal, absolute, and all-embracing entity, if such exist, is so far removed from being the highest order of person, that it must be much rather the lowest order of person, the absolute minimum as regards personality, at the same time the status evanescensevanescens (=0) of personality in general· But this means that the well-understood categorial coherence of this whole perspective proves exactly the opposite of that which personalism tries to prove by it: God—if one succeeds in drawing Him into this perspective—is not the highest and absolute person, but the absolutely impersonal being. The concept of Him, seen from this point of view, would be the negative limiting concept of personality in general.' In effect, Hartmann's Self</page><page sequence="3">22ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Existent Being is not deity conceived as Super-personal, or even the only true person amid a realm of incomplete personalities, but the ideal realm of values as a Creative Power impinging upon the world of the senses and of human society, and calling for man's co-operation. The reader will perhaps feel that it is largely a question of terms, and that it is a trifle perverse to talk about a Creative Power, and at the same time to refer deprecatingly to the all-depressing preponderance of the personalistic idea of God. Nobody wants to grudge the philosopher his reaction against sheer anthropomorphism, but the cult of the im personal can become exceedingly wearisome when it is over-emphasized. Volume III is entitled ' Moral Freedom' and is a vigorous defence of the freedom of the will and a criticism of wrong ways of trying to prove it. ' The causal determinism which has been most feared has been shewn to be perfectly innocuous; but finalistic determination, which has been supreme for so long in philosophic theories and has been held to be harmless, has turned out to be the real evil, the destroyer of human freedom.' The tone of the work is plainly influenced by the Lutheran ancestry of the writer, who regards the concept of sin as the specially revolutioniz ing factor in Christian ethics. A Catholic writer would have written י Grace' instead. Similarly, in his very last chapter occurs the emphasis upon the guilt and curse of sin and the weight with which it burdens a man. This outlook is typical, and similar passages could easily be quoted from Paulsen, another of Hartmann's predecessors at Berlin. The task of translation has been borne by Dr Stanton Coit, the well known pastor of the Ethical Church in London, and his daughter. Coit significantly hails the book as a fresh confirmation of the message which he has sought to preach for years to the English-speaking public, not per haps with any great success. He holds that a constructive ethical realism, absolutist, and yet undogmatic, is destined to prove of infinite value to our puzzled generation, the authoritative foundation of whose established moral order has been blown to atoms. Professor Muirhead contributes an introduction in which he refers to the apparent veto imposed by Hartmann on any attempt to found theistic conclusions on any alleged postulates of the moral consciousness. In this matter Dr Muirhead holds that the author is only concerned with guarding against the falsification of moral values which must result from any suggestion that the love of man owes the chief part of its value to its merely being a step to the love of God as a transcendent being. Hartmann, he shews, insists on the presence in the higher moral values of elements of faith and hope, in which ' man sees himself caught up into a larger providence, which looks beyond him, and yet is his own'.
