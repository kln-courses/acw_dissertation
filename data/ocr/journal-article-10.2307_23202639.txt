<plain_text><page sequence="1">JACQUES LIPCHITZ'S TRANSFORMATIONS OF AN EROTIC THEME Avigdor W. G. Poséq Lipchitz's Couple (Fig. 1)—a man and a woman engaged in sexual intercourse—has proved puzzling to critics. The overt sensual ity of this work, which is not often paralleled in Western art, is no longer as provocative as it was in 1929, when the sculpture was first shown. Neither its meaning nor the curious ambiguity of the configuration, however, has been sufficiently clarified. A reclining woman supports her slightly raised midriff on her el bows and feet as she offers herself to her male partner, who, kneeling between her thighs, forcibly thrusts himself into her body. The physical effort conveyed by the tense backward push of his head counters her pas sive abandon, but the sweeping rhythm shared by the lovers seems to forge them into a stylized theriomorphic entity.1 The sculp ture rests on a platform supported by four slanted legs that seem to bend under its weight. The more angular male forms a pro tective carapace enfolding the undulating curvature of the female, while their two dif ferentiated heads resemble the gaping jaws of a monstrous tortoise. But the fantastic image does not cancel out the embracing pair, and both images are perceived simultaneously. The ambivalence, which seems to identify the sexual act as the liberation of a repressed pri mordial animal instinct, endows the sculpture with extraordinary expressive power. The equivocal effect has been noted by critics. The merger of human and zoomor phic forms has been freely associated with preclassical archetypal representations of man and animal, but its conceptual signifi cance has proved difficult to define. A critic who at first saw only the tortoise described it as "an image of a vanished past arising from the artist's subterranean reality," while a later writer compared the pervasive formal rhythm of this composition with "the wordless train of subconscious thought."2 The submerged content of the representation was even inti mated by its author, who also traced it to a subliminal mainspring. In his autobiography, Lipchitz says that, when it was first shown, the Couple was con sidered shocking and thus could not be ex hibited outside France. To overcome this dif ficulty, he changed the title to The Cry ("Le Cri"), and, as such, the sculpture was shown in Amsterdam until a perceptive viewer called attention to its eroticism, creating such a scandal that the work was removed. Later, it was exhibited in Paris without any trouble. But when the artist prepared to have it sent to the United States, he was advised that American customs might seize it as pornog raphy.3 Remembering this episode almost four decades later, Lipchitz commented that with all the permissiveness in painting and sculpture, in motion pictures, and in our lives generally, the story seemed "like a lot of fuss about nothing." But the biographer to whom he confided his reminiscences still felt the need to justify the sculptor's interest in the subject. He observed that "it was natural that Lipchitz, a young man of strong emotions ... living in a bohemian society, should have fre quently explored the theme of sensual love."4 Be that as it may, Lipchitz's unabashed rendering of the motif has few parallels among the works of his fellow artists. The</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 J. Lipchitz, Couple. 1929. Bronze, 171.1 x 147.3 cm. Otterlo (Netherlands) Rijksmuseum Kroller Muller choice of subject is especially remarkable in the light of his strict upbringing in the Ortho dox Jewish community of Druskeniki (then on the Polish-Lithuanian border), where overt manifestations of sensuality would not have been tolerated.5 Lipchitz, in fact, felt that he had to apologize for the candor of the work, and in his biography he explains that the sexual theme arose from his profound sorrow over the deaths of his sister and fa ther. His depressive state was probably ag gravated by the recent death of his good friend Juan Gris, to whose influence Lipchitz owed his interest in Cubism. He adds, how</page><page sequence="3">34 ever, that not being a pessimist by nature, he made this sculpture "as a kind of release, a defiance to show that in the midst of tragedy life must continue, that we must live and multiply." Although Lipchitz felt that the configuration conveyed an ambiguous rela tionship, he described it as a positive and joyful statement of hope and optimism, im plying that "in the midst of death there is love, and procreation, and birth."6 The almost Biblical tone of these com ments, evoking God's command to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 1:28), might be associ ated with the artist's mature interest in Bibli cal themes and mysticism.7 The esoteric Jewish tradition regarded the Old Testament commandment as one of the most sacred mysteries. Concluding from the verse "And Adam knew Eve his wife" (Genesis 4:1) that God's supreme intelligence was identified with the sexual act, the Kabbalists considered the physical congress of male and female as an allegory of man's relation to Divinity (Shekinah) comparable to the Christian unio mistical This ideology is also evident in exe gesis of the Song of Solomon. The explicit sensuality of these verses—which scholars have related to pagan celebrations of Tam muz, the Semitic patron of sexuality—has, by Jewish exegetes, been understood as a sub lime allegory of God's love for His people.9 Lipchitz referred to the allegorical theme in a later version of the Couple (begun in 1934 but finished only in 1946) called the Song of Songs (Fig. 2).10 This work also illustrates a pair of lovers whose sinuous fluidity directly evokes Biblical metaphors such as "the joints of thy thighs are like jewels. . . . Thy navel is like a round goblet. . . . Thy belly is like a heap of wheat. . . . Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are the twins" (Song of Solomon 7:1-3). These verses, however, are less applicable to the original Couple, and neither in the work itself nor in Lipchitz's recorded memo ries is there any indication that he was inter ested in the Biblical subject when he made the sculpture. In fact, the opposite seems to be true, for, like most of his fellow artists, he seems to have deliberately avoided religious motifs. His early works display a decisive preference for secular, uncomplicated motifs that throw into relief the novelty of Cubism. Later, as his devotion to Cubism waned, he became attracted to erotic themes. Through his contact with French intellectuals, he would have known that their interest in new psychological theories of human sexuality led to a renewed interest in classical mythology, especially Ovid's Ars Amatoria ("The Art of Love") and the Metamorphoses.11 Lipchitz's interest in mythology is reflected in a sculpture made only a short time before he began to work on the Couple, showing a reclining Leda being mounted by Zeus as an anthropomorphic swan, whose wide open beak and long neck, suggestive of a phallic erection, effectively convey sexual ecstasy (Fig. 3a).12 The subject matter can be traced to the Ars Amatoria, where Leda is briefly mentioned as the prototype of concupiscent women who skillfully lure their lovers (3.251).13 In the Metamorphoses (6.105), she is described as already "lying under the wings of the Swan."14 The disguised Zeus's volup tuous congress with Leda was also popular in classical art. In large-scale statuary, the se duction was usually depicted with Zeus rap ing the nude Leda in a standing position. In relief sculpture, especially on Roman sar cophagi, where the image was presumably meant to dispel fears of death by alluding to otherworldly bliss, Leda usually reclines.15 The mythographical tradition merged in the Renaissance with the mystical interpretation of the Song of Songs as an allegory of the soul's desire to be conjoined with God, stim ulating a revival of antique iconographic for</page><page sequence="4">35 Fig. 2 J. Lipchitz, Song of Songs. 1946. Bronze, 59.7 x 91.5 cm. Collection Mrs. Henry H. Hope, Bloomington muías.16 The standing-Leda type was chosen by Leonardo for a painting known only in contemporary copies,17 while the other type showing the swan with a reclining Leda was adopted by Michelangelo. His painting is also lost, but the configuration has been preserved in a free replica by Rosso Florentino and a related drawing, and in an engraving by Cor nelius Bos thought to be more faithful to the original (Fig. 3b).18 One investigation of Michelangelo's composition has convincingly argued that his version was directly derived from a pseudo-classical relief showing a swan approaching a recumbent Leda,19 whom Michelangelo also used as a model for Night in the Cappella Medici, where the swan is transformed into an owl posed near Night's vulva.20 The statue's close resemblance to the mythological lover suggests a conceptual re lationship that may perhaps be explained by the fact that Leda's name, usually understood as "Lady," was also interpreted as "Night," and by the antique funerary connotations of the theme.21 Scholars recognizing Michelangelo's Leda as a counterpart to the Medici person ification referred to the affinity of love and death reflected in the association of Eros and Thanatos, his twin brother, and also to the Humanistic reinterpretation of Christian sal vation through the love of God,22 which re verberates in Lorenzo de' Medici's claim that only love enables men to overcome their fear</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3a J. Lipchitz, Leda and the Swan. 1928. Bronze, 10 x 15.5 cm. Israel Museum, Jerusalem of death and that the vita amorosa proceeds from death because whoever lives for love first dies for everything else.23 Lipchitz may not have been particularly interested in Neoplatonic theories of love or in the scholarly interpretations of Michelan gelo's work, but he could have seen a repro duction of the Leda and noted her resem blance to the Medici statue. Impressed by the expressiveness of the reclining pose, he adopted it for his own Leda and later for the female lover in the Couple, where the bird is restored to his human appearance. However, it is striking that Lipchitz also associated copulation with death and bereavement. One is even tempted to speculate that he intended to represent the dual aspect of love. But, un like the Renaissance masters, who in their representations of Leda conveyed inhibited libidinous drives,24 Lipchitz probably con ceived of the classical theme as a sublime al legory. He later spiritualized it in the Song of Songs, while in the Couple he honored the carnal desire shared by mortal lovers. As the composition of the Couple evolved from preliminary sketch into final version, Lipchitz accentuated the lovers' formal com plementarity, which clarified the zoomorphic appearance of the configuration. Although the ambiguity was presumably not intentional and, as we have seen by his comment, on the conscious level he would have hardly associ ated the theme of love with an "unclean" ani mal (Leviticus 11:29), one wonders whether</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 3b C. Bos, a copy of Michelangelo's Leda and the Swan. Seventeenth century. Engraving. British Museum, London the roaring reptile may not be related to the inhibitions of Lipchitz's childhood. The effect of the shrieking tortoise was implicitly ac knowledged by the artist himself when he changed his work's title to The Cry. He later remembered this as an amusing subterfuge, but the spontaneous formation of the zoomorphic image seems curiously appropri ate to the sculpture's erotic content. In antiquity, both the tortoise (Testudo graeca) and the turtle (Testudo gigantea) were endowed with multiple symbolism.25 As totemic incarnations of the benefactory divine powers, these animals were considered sacred and inviolable. According to Pausanias (8.54.7), they were connected with the popu lar cult of Pan. The emergence of the turtle's head from its protective shell evoked phallic erection, while the hollow shape of its shell was related to the vulva. In being thus associ ated with both male and female sexuality, the reptiles came to symbolize sexual union. As such, they were the subject of numerous leg ends. For instance, Aelian, in discussing the characteristics of the (land) tortoise (De Natura Animalium 15.14), says that the male is the most lustful of creatures, but the fe male mates unwillingly. She couples only when looking at the male (i.e., lying on her back), and, being unable to turn over when the male has satisfied his desire, she easily becomes the prey of eagles.26 To coax her into submission, the male tortoise casts an "amorous spell" produced by a mysterious</page><page sequence="7">38 herb, which causes the reluctant female to become ardent and, banishing her fear, makes her pursue her partner in a frenzied desire to mate. Elsewhere, Aelian (4.28) re ports that a decapitated turtle's head seems alive, which, in addition to suggesting the animal's immortality, also implies the survival of sexual instinct. The fact that the turtle was believed to feed on vipers and was, therefore, immune to poison made its flesh into a di etary delicacy supposedly endowed with salutary effect. The belief in the tortoise's remedial properties persisted in certain folk lore traditions,27 while the use of the shell in the production of musical instruments such as the lyre also associated it with the work of art as an object—and, implicitly, with creative transformation. On a different conceptual level, the turtle's proverbial longevity and its sloughing its "old age" (De Natura Animalium 9.37) accounts for its role as a symbol of eternity, while its short legs came to represent stability. The contrast between its domelike shell and its flat, square-shaped bottom was compared to the dome of heaven and the earth below, making the animal a generic symbol of the universe. In the latter context, it is often re ferred to in cosmogonic myths, especially in the Hindi tale of the second avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, in which form he supports Earth.28 This particular motif seems to be evoked in Lipchitz's Couple in the sculptured four-legged base, while the work's garden setting and Lipchitz's comment on its implicit message also define it as an allegory of the timeless laws of nature. Although there is nothing to confirm that Lipchitz was aware of the various traditions concerning tortoises and turtles, their sym bolical connotations seem to converge in his Couple. By interpreting the sexual theme as an allegory of the eternal life cycle and a po tential remedy for his psychic depression, the artist endowed the configuration with the an cient meanings ascribed to these animals. At the same time, the ambiguity of his image embodies the creative transformation of re ality into fantasy. The position that the Cou ple occupies in Lipchitz's oeuvre—namely, between the literal rendering of Leda and the Swan and the sublimated sensuality of the Song of Songs—illustrates his progression from classical mythology to Biblical allegory by way of an erotic motif. The series thus al lows one to trace a critical phase in the evo lution of Lipchitz's depiction of archetypal themes found in his later works.29 NOTES 1. J. Lipchitz and H. H.
