<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPRESENTATION OF NAGA IN THE BUDDHIST ART OF AMARAVATI: A SCULPTURAL ANALYSIS Shrikant Ganvir Nagas and Naginis attained an important position in the religio-cultural scenario of ancient Indian society, which is validated by literary and art-historical sources. The study of Buddhist art helps us to comprehend the place of Naga-Nagini in the religio-cultural scenario of Buddhism and contemporary society. The present paper aims at comprehending the position of Naga in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. The depictions of Muchalinda Naga have been much preferred in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. Numerous depictions of the theme suggest its significant place in the religio-cultural setting of the society. Muchalinda Naga is depicted on a fine stupa slab presently exhibited in the British Museum, London, (BM 81). The front of the ayaka platform is embellished with a Naga having a five-headed hood. The spirally coiled body is folded into four loops showing the check design on the body. The Naga rests upon a low platform adorned with a railing pattern. This is a simple depiction of the Naga in which the absence of the Buddhist symbols associated with the Naga is striking. An interesting feature of the sculptured slab is the representation of miniature five-headed Naga on the outermost corners of the drum. The slab can be dated to the third century CE.1 The depiction of such stupa panel adorned with Muchalinda Naga is also found on another slab displayed in the same museum.2 Another depiction of the Naga is noticed on a drum slab preserved in the British Museum, London (BM 39). The slab shows a plain stupa on a lotus base. A five-headed Naga having a spirally coiled body and scaly, curling tail protects the opening of the stupa. Pillars adorned with four lotus medallions flank the opening of the stupa. The drum slab can be dated to the second century CE.3 An interesting illustration of Muchalinda Naga is depicted on the outer face of the pillar of the stupa presently exhibited in the British Museum, London, (BM 47). The pillar has been divided into three sections, containing central lotus medallion and two medallions depicting a half-lotus at top and bottom of the pillar. The upper area of fluting depicts the Naga at the centre. The Naga has a five-headed hood with spirally coiled body having three loops and a collar at the neck. Lotus flowers and buds are shown on either side of the Naga. A female standing on makara on either side flanks the Naga panel. The</page><page sequence="2">1064 IHC: Proceedings, 71st Session , 2010-11 females carry large bowls and small pots. This panel is dated to the second century CE.4 A stupa slab depicting Muchalinda Naga is exhibited in the Archaeological Museum, Amaravati (A. 7). A five-headed Naga is depicted at the centre of the panel and the central hood crowned by a chhatra. Two worshippers including a male and a female on either side flank the Naga. The hands of both worshippers are shown in namaskaramudra but the hands of the male worshipper are placed on the chest whereas the hands of the female worshipper are raised over the head. A pot bellied dwarf Yaksha stands on either side next to the worshippers carrying a pot, probably containing flowers in raised hands over the head. Another panel depicting the same figure is seen on a dome slab exhibited in the same museum (A.61). The upper section of the slab depicts a plain stupa with a five-headed Naga at the center. Another depiction of Muchalinda Naga is noticed on a drum slab. The slab shows an elegantly adorned stupa on a lotus base. A five- headed Naga having a spirally coiled body with five loops protects the opening of the stupa. The central hood is topped by a chhatra. Pillars adorned with four lotus roundels flank the opening of the stupa. A worshipper holding hands in namaskaramudra on either side flanks the stupa. A vidyadhara carrying a pot full with flowers is shown either side of the highly adorned harmika of the stupa. The drum slab can be dated to the second century CE on the basis of the sculptural features.5 Muchalinda Naga is depicted on a plain stupa slab. The front of the ayaka platform is adorned with a Naga having a five-headed hood. The spirally coiled body with check design is folded into five loops. The Naga rests upon a low platform faced with a small railing pattern. In this depiction, there is an absence of the Buddhist symbols associated with the Naga. Vidyadharas are flying on either side at the top of the stupa panel. The slab can be dated to the third century CE.6 Similar depiction of Muchalinda Naga is also noticed in another stupa slab.7 Another representation of Muchalinda Naga is found on a gracefully adorned stupa slab. The front of the ayaka platform is embellished with a five-headed Naga. The spirally coiled body is folded into five loops with check design. The Naga rests upon a lotus placed on a low platform decorated with a plain railing pattern. It is interesting to note that two floral garlands are shown above the Naga hood. A remarkable characteristic of the sculptured slab is presence of a gandharva with * elephantine ears at the right corner of the topmost portion of the panel. A miniature five-headed Naga is shown on the outermost corners of the drum of the stupa panel. The panel can be dated to the third century CE.8 Similar type of depiction is also noticed in another stupa slab</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology 1065 with minor changes. The Naga rests upon lotus having double petals.9 Another depiction of the Naga is noticed on a fragment of drum slab preserved in the Government Museum, Chennai. A five-headed Naga placed on double-petalled lotus protects the opening of the stupa. The Naga has spirally coiled body and scaly, curling tail. The lotus is seen at the front of the Naga which suggests a lake. The drum slab is dated to the second century CE.10 A fascinating depiction of Muchalinda Naga enshrined in the shrine is also noticed in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. In this depiction a fíve-headed Naga is placed above the Buddhapadas , which symbolically represents the Naga as protecting the Buddha, in a small conical shaped shrine. The worshippers are seen in front of the shrine, with folded hands. This is a unique kind of representation showing protection of the Buddha by Muchalinda Naga.11 Another remarkable depiction of Muchalinda Naga protecting the Buddhapadas is also observed in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. This depiction is shown on the railing coping of the great stupa at Amaravati. The five-headed Naga is shown shading the Buddhapadas resting on a full-blown lotus. Only the head part of the Naga is visible in the depiction. The ten worshippers including three Nagas and seven Naginis worship the Buddhapadas. The bodhi tree is seen towards the left side of the lotus and the Naga. The chief of the worshipper group has a seven-headed hood probably representing a king whereas the other two males possibly princes, have five-headed hoods. The female worshippers do not show any hood.12 An anthropomorphic representation of Muchalinda Naga is also noticed in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. This depiction is shown on the railing coping presently exhibited in the Government Museum, Chennai. The railing coping depicts a thick rolling garland carried by a series of running young men. The upper portion of the right side of the panel depicts a Nagaraja with folded hands. He is shown seated on four coils of the body and a seven-hooded canopy shades the head. The uppermost coil is marked with the Buddhapadas. The Nagaraja Muchalinda is flanked by a woman with offerings on either side.13 This is a unique kind of representation of Muchalinda Naga in the Buddhist art of the Deccan during the Satavahana phase. Another depiction of the same kind is presently exhibited in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Another type of depiction in which the Buddha is shown in a human form is also noticed in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. The first depiction of this type is seen on an elegantly adorned drum slab showing a stupa panel, presently exhibited in the British Museum, London (BM 70). Inside the gateway of the stupa is an image of seated Buddha, protected by Muchalinda Naga. Muchalinda Naga has two canopies: the outer</page><page sequence="4">1066 IHC: Proceedings, 71st Session , 2010-11 canopy has fourteen-hoods whereas the inner one has seven-hoods. The Buddha is seated on the six coils of the Naga. The right hand of the Buddha is in abhaya mudra and a fly-whisk bearer on either side flanks him. Two pairs of worshipping women are seen at the front. The sculpture can be dated to the third century CE. The second depiction of this type is seen on a gracefully ornamented drum slab showing a stupa panel. In the entrance of the gateway of the stupa is an image of a seated Buddha, protected by Muchalinda Naga. The Naga has an eleven-hooded canopy. The Buddha is seated on the five coils of the Naga. The right hand of the Buddha is depicted in abhaya mudra . Naga worshippers on either side flank the Buddha. The hands of the worshippers are exhibited in namaskaramudra. The male worshipper has a five headed hood whereas the female has a single- headed hood. Five worshippers are seen at the front. The sculpture can be dated to the third century CE.15 The third depiction of the same kind is nearly similar to the first depiction with some minor changes. In this depiction, the Naga has a single canopy consisting of seven hoods. The Buddha is seated on the four coils of the Naga. Five worshippers including a child are seen at the front. 16 The fourth depiction of this type, shown on a damaged stupa slab is now deposited in the reserve collection in the Archaeological Museum, Amaravati (AUS neg.no. 194.85). In this depiction, an image of a seated Buddha is shown inside the gateway of the stupa. A nine- headed Muchalinda Naga protects the Buddha. The Buddha sits on the four coils of the body of the Naga. Worshippers with folded hands on either side flank the Buddha. The hands of the Buddha are shown in dhyana mudra. Two female Naga worshippers are seen at the front. The worshippers are shown kneeling to the Buddha with folded hands. The fifth depiction of this type is shown on a fragment of stupa slab presently exhibited in the Government Museum, Chennai. In this depiction, an image of seated Buddha is shown in the entrance of the gateway of the stupa. The Buddha sits on the four coils of the body of the Naga. A seven-headed canopy of Muchalinda Naga protects the Buddha. The Buddha is flanked by chamara- bearers on either side.

The lower part of the pillar depicts Muchalinda Naga in a half lotus medallion. The Naga has a five-headed hood surmounted by a chhatra . An arrangement probably intended for lamps is seen on either side. A miniature representation of Muchalinda Naga attests to its significant place in the religio-cultural scenario of the period.18</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology 1067 Another fascinating theme depicted in the Buddhist art of Amaravati is the stupa of Ramagrama guarded by Nagas. This theme is exceptionally depicted in the early Buddhist art of Deccan. The finest sculpture depicting this theme is now exhibited in the Government Museum, Chennai. The stupa is placed on a double-petalled lotus. Three entwined five-headed Nagas encircle the dome of the stupa. A Naga devotee having five-headed hood stands on either side of the stupa. The drum of the stupa is decorated with three depictions of Muchalinda Naga having five-headed hood and four loops of the body. A Naga devotee is seen at the right corner of the panel beside the harmika of the stupa. A female worshipper is shown on either side of the stupa.19 The second depiction of the theme is presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 108). The stupa is worshipped by a pair of graceful elephants, which pay reverence by offering garlands. The dome of the stupa is encircled by a pair of four-hooded snakes whose coils are entwined in knots. The sculpture is dated to the first century CE.20 The third depiction of the theme is presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 4). The depiction of the Ramagrama stupa is depicted on the outer face of the railing pillar. The theme is illustrated on the upper fluted area of the pillar. The central panel of the upper fluted region shows an elegant stupa in low relief worshipped by a kneeling couple a male on the right and the female on the left. A pair of knotted three-hooded Nagas encircles the dome of the stupa. Knox suggests this is possibly a depiction of the Ramagrama stupa guarded by Nagas.21 In the Buddhist art of Amaravati, the attempted opening of the Ramagrama stupa is also depicted. This is a noteworthy representation of the theme, which has not been reported from any other site. The upper panel of a casing slab depicts this theme. A pair of three-hooded Nagas whose coils are interwined in knots encloses the dome of the stupa. Two workers are shown digging at the base of the stupa. A pair of Nagaraja and his queen standing on either side of the stupa is seen worshipping the stupa. The Nagaraja has a five-headed hood whereas the queen has a single-headed hood. Sivaramamurti writes it is an intervention of the Nagas that prevents the workers digging at the base of the stupa from fulfilling their purposes.22 Another incident showing the bath of Buddha in the Nairanjana River is associated with the Buddha's enlightenment, which also portrays Nagas. The sculptural panels depicting this theme are not frequently found in the art of Amaravati. Three sculptures are reported form the Amaravati art exhibiting this theme. The first depiction showing this theme is the finest among the depictions. This sculptural</page><page sequence="6">1068 IHC: Proceedings, 71st Session, 2010-11 slab is presently exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (29. 151). This depiction is carved in relief on the reverse side of the slab. Four flying females and Naga king Kalika with his two queens are shown paying reverence to the Buddha, who is symbolically represented with Buddhapadas. Flying females are carrying water pots on their heads. The Naga king Kalika has a five-headed hood whereas Naga queens have a single-headed hood. The Naga king, flanked by a queen on either side is seen standing up to their hips in water with hands shown in namaskaramudra making gestures of veneration. Tiny figures of a turtle and a crocodile appear in the water below. The sculpture can be dated to the second century CE.23 The second depiction representing this theme is seen on the inner face of the pillar of the stupa presently exhibited in the British Museum, London (BM 4). The theme is illustrated on the upper fluted area of the pillar. The central panel of the upper fluted region shows a river in a line of waves above the Buddhapadas. A tree is shown on either side of the river. A hand is seen coming out from the tree on the left, which belongs to a tree spirit. This tree spirit is supposed to offer it to the Buddha help him in his journey across the river. The women carrying purnaghatas are seen on the right of the river. Naga king Kalika and his three queens are depicted paying reverence to the Buddha with raised hands. The Naga king has a seven-headed hood while the queens have a single-headed hood. This sculpture is dated to the second century CE.24 The third depiction representing this theme is seen on the drum slab of the stupa presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 70). In the entrance of the gateway is an image of the Buddha standing at the Nairanjana River. The Buddha stands on a small platform on a flat surface representing the river. His right hand is in abhaya mudra and the left hand grasps the edge of the robe. The sculpture is dated to the third century CE.25 A slab now exhibited in the Government museum, Chennai illustrates the Buddha preaching to Nagas. The slab depicts the Buddha seated in padmasana with his right hand in abhaya mudra , delivering discourse to a Nagaraja and Nagini on either side. The portion of the upper left side is broken. The Nagarajas standing on both sides pay reverence to the Buddha with their folded hands while the Nagini on the left admires the Buddha. The Nagini on the right adores the Buddha with her folded hands.26 Another depiction on a stupa slab shows adoration of the Buddha by the Naga rajas. This panel is presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 79). In this depiction, worship of the Buddha by the Nagarajas is shown in the gateway of the stupa. The Buddha stands with the right hand in abhaya mudra . The</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology 1069 Nagaraja and probably his queen sit on either side of the Buddha. They adore the Buddha with folded hands. Two worshippers are shown at the front. This panel is dated to the third century CE.27 An interesting illustration of Nagas is depicted on a stupa slab currently exhibited in the British Museum, London (BM 120). In this depiction, worship of the Buddha by the Nagas is shown inside the gateway of the stupa. Five Naga worshippers along with five female worshippers are seen adoring the footprints of the Buddha. The footprints seem to be placed on the coiled and scaly body of the Naga. This depiction portrays a symbolic representation of the protection of the Buddha by the Muchalinda Naga.28 This panel can be dated to the third century CE.29 The worship of the relic casket of the Buddha by the Nagarajas is also depicted in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. The theme is elegantly portrayed on the inner face of the panel of a railing crossbar. This panel is presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 8). The relic casket of the Buddha is placed on a three-sided throne. The Nagaraja having a seven-headed hood stands behind the throne with hands in anjali mudra . He is flanked by Naga fly-whisk bearers on either side. Two males with folded hands raised above their heads stand next to the Naga fly-whisk bearers on either side. Female worshippers are seen kneeling to the relic casket of the Buddha with hands shown in namaskara mudra . This panel is dated to the third century CE.30 Another depiction on a stupa slab shows worship of the relic casket of the Buddha by the Nagarajas. This panel is presently displayed in the British Museum, London (BM 69). In this depiction, worship of the relic casket of the Buddha by the Nagaraj as is shown in the gateway of the stupa. The relic casket of the Buddha is placed on a three-sided throne, flanked by Naga female fly-whisk bearers. The Naga king and four Naga females adore the relic casket of the Buddha. This panel is dated to the third century CE.31 The Naga and Naginis are also represented as worshipping Buddhist symbols in the Buddhist art of Amaravati. A circular medallion of the rail depicts symbolic worship of Buddha by Nagas. The upper portion of the medallion shows a triratna placed on a fiery pillar behind an altar. The Buddhapadas are shown in front of the altar. A Nagaraja is seated on either side with folded hands to pay reverence to the Buddha. A fly- whisk bearer stands on either side of the fiery pillar. The Nagarajas have an eight-headed hood, which is not generally found in the Amaravati art.32 Another depiction of such type is seen on an inner face of a pillar. This panel is shown on the left side of middle fluted area. A triratna is placed on a pillar behind an altar encircled by lotus</page><page sequence="8">1070 ÍHC: Proceedings, 71st Session, 2010-11 petals. The Buddhapadas are shown in the circular altar. A Naga king and his family including a queen, prince and princess are shown with folded hands adoring the Buddhist symbols. The women carrying purnaghatas are seen on the left of the pillar. Two birds are also seen beside these women. It is interesting to note that a hierarchy has been mentioned in the family of the Naga king. The Naga king has a seven- headed hood and the queen has a single-headed hood. The Naga prince and princess have two-headed and single-headed hoods respectively.33 In another depiction, a Nagaraja is seen worshipping a triratna placed on a pillar behind a throne. A monk, the Nagaraja and other devotees also worship two relic bundles. The Buddhapadas are shown at the front of the throne.34 The Buddhist art of Amaravati vividly illustrates diverse representations of Nagas. This not only proposes the prevalence of Naga worship but also emphasizes the significance of Nagas in the religio-cultural scenario of the region in the Satavahana period. The depictions of Naga and Nagini have been reported from the Buddhist art of Satavahana period on large scale. Muchalinda Naga attained an esteemed place in the religio-cultural setting of Buddhism in Deccan. This can be validated by occurrence of copious depictions of Muchalinda Naga in the region. This attests to the popularity and importance gained by Nagas in the religio-cultural scenario of the region especially in the Satavahana period. Worship of Buddha jointly along with Muchalinda Naga flourished in the Buddhist art of Deccan region during the Satavahana period. It seems that the Naga cult was predominating in Deccan region hence repetitive depiction of the theme showing the protection of the Buddha by Muchalinda Naga was much - preferred by the contemporary society signifying its pivotal place in the religio-cultural scenario of the contemporary society.
