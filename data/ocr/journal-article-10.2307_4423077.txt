The majority of these pieces are found in three historically important century-old collections of French materials: that of Henri Christy, largely from the Magdalenian sites of La Madeleine (after which the period is named), Les Eyzies and Laugerie Basse, and those of the Viscount de Lastic-Saint-Jal and Peccadeau de l'Isle, containing materials from the Magdalenian sites of Trou des Forges and Mon- tastruc at Bruniquel. The materials from these sites were crucial in the early development of the science of Old World Prehistory, and they still constitute basic collections in this field, but the pieces are now scattered; in addition to the British Museum they are found in the Musee des Antiquites Nationales (Saint- Germain-en-Laye), the Musee de l'Homme (Paris), the Musde d'Histoire Naturelle (Montauban), and in collections at Toulouse, Talence, Les Eyzies, Perigueux, and Cambridge. The British Museum materials are, therefore, important not only historically but as documents necessary for a comprehensive and comparative study of Upper Palaeolithic European engraving. The British Museum collection has two engraved artifacts from the Aurig- nacian site of the Gorge d'Enfer, which are among the earliest engraved objects found and published by Lartet and Christy. These are among the few engraved objects known from this period. The Museum also has some pieces from Cress- well Crags and Church Hole in England, as well as single pieces from other sites on the Continent. An examination and analysis of these materials in the British Museum by a stereoscopic zoom microscope with a magnification range of Io x to 6o x has significantly supplemented the research results obtained by the author during a five-year programme of microscopic and comparative analysis on the Continent.' In the long-term programme the methods adopted were both internal and comparative. As part of the study, all of the available engraved pieces from a single site and a single level were subjected to microscopic analysis. The data from the different levels of one site were then compared with the data obtained from comparable levels in other sites that were regionally and temporally related. 137 T</page><page sequence="5">Cross-cultural comparisons were then conducted among the different European Upper Palaeolithic engraving traditions: Franco-Cantabrian, the East Gravet- tian, and the Mediterranean. Finally, an evolutionary development was estab- lished for each of these regional and temporal traditions and an attempt was made to determine the common cognitive and stylistic characteristics and influences among them. Internal and comparative analysis revealed an unexpected cognitive and symbolic complexity, as well as technical and stylistic differences, in the engraving traditions of the late Upper Pleistocene. Since the methodology and results are new, I present here the analysis of two small, apparently insigni- ficant fragments from the Aurignacian and Late Magdalenian in the British Museum collection to illustrate the scope of the findings and the nature of the analytical problems involved in the microscopic, comparative method. AURIGNACIAN (C. 32,000-25,000 B.C.) An engraved fragment (8 cm.) of shaped and flattened bone from the Abri Lartet in the Gorge d'Enfer in the Vezere valley of the Dordogne was described by Lartet and Christy as a 'Bone knife-like Implement, notched and scored'.2 The fragment has a deteriorated surface, a heavy soil encrustation, and it has been additionally covered by a protective coat of shellac. This combination has made microscopic analysis somewhat more difficult than usual (Fig. I and Pls. XLVIII and XLIx), but at the same time it has highlighted the value and sig- nificance of the comparative method. The fragment belongs to a class of engraved mobiliary artifact which has been found in the earliest Upper Palaeolithic levels (the Chatelperronian of Arcy-sur-Cure) and with increasing frequency in the later periods. In Lartet and Christy's volume an essay was devoted to what were called these 'tally' pieces.3 Recently A. Leroi-Gourhan suggested that these marked objects should be differentiated from the art, symbolism, and signs of the caves: 'these ... objects . . were long ago named "marques de chasse", "hunting tallies". Needless to say, nothing has been discovered to support this designation: the idea of the hunter consistently making a notch on his small stick every time he brought down a mammoth is more entertaining than plausible. Whatever the purpose of these objects, their occurrence throughout the Upper Palaeolithic is a remark- able phenomenon. The earliest representation we have of a rhythmic arrange- ment with regular intervals, the beginning of the evolution that led to the ruler, the musical staff, the calendar . . .'.4 In 1958 Karel Absolon, on the basis of the East Gravettian of Moravia, Czechoslovakia, tentatively suggested that they indicated the use of a 'decimal' system of numbers based on a finger count and the numbers '5' and '10'.s Despite a century of research, there has been no generally acceptable theory for an explanation of these marks and particularly no methodology or technology for their study. The piece in the British Museum, 138</page><page sequence="6">because of its condition, would, by itself, offer no opportunity for a clarification of the problem. Fortunately the fragment in London from the Gorge d'Enfer may be related to a companion piece, a bone 'knife' at Saint-Germain-en-Laye6 from the same site and level and made in the same style. This is a relatively unbroken artifact (1 o I cm.) without encrustation (Fig. 2 and Pls. L and LI). Comparative micro- scopic analysis of these two bones from a single level was carried out and they were then compared with similarly engraved French pieces from the same general period. The 'knife' at Saint-Germain is engraved in the same manner as the London fragment, that is, with compositions that are different in form and detail on each face as well as being notched along the edges. On each face there are groups of linear marks. These are somewhat more carefully made and placed near the rim and towards the narrow, forward half of the bone on the example at Saint- Germain. A visual comparison of the two bones is sufficient to indicate that the linear groups on the London fragment were engraved in a freer, looser manner and with a larger use of space but, nevertheless, in the same basic tradition. Microscopic examination of the Saint-Germain example indicated that the so-called 'knife' showed no evidence of use in cutting nor any primary area of wear or polish along the edges or faces of the forward, narrow half of the bone, towards the point, as would occur if this were a knife or a polisher. Instead, it is towards the wider rear and along the back that one finds evidence of a generalized polishing, an equal rounding of the notches, as though the object had been subjected to persistent handling. This evidence of handling at the rear and lack of evidence for cutting, scraping, or polishing towards the point was found to be true of other Aurignacian bones of this type. It may hint at a non-frictional usage of the object as a pressure flaker or perhaps as a regularly handled ceremonial or ritual object. It was certainly not used as a knife. Of more significance, the microscope revealed that the groups of linear marks on both faces were made by different points which engraved lines with distinc- tive cross sections. Each group was also made at a different angle, to a different rhythm and spacing, with a different pressure cutting to a different depth, and to a different length. The process is clear both in the macrophotographic detail and in the schematic line illustration of the first face (Fig. 2 and Pls. L and LI). These results show that the groups were intentional rather than random and, because of the complex changes, suggest they were neither conceived nor engraved as a single scheme of decoration. Instead, they had been differentiated as 'sets' which had been put down, or accumulated, sequentially in time. The microscopic evidence for the lengths of time involved in this sequential nota- tional process will be discussed in a monograph devoted to methodology.7 On the British Museum fragment, despite the deterioration, the encrustation, 139</page><page sequence="7">and the shellac, the microscope was able to pick up the intentionally engraved marks on both faces and to establish that they were made in the same fashion, in groups, at varying angles, rhythms, positions and, as far as could be determined, by different points. These point differences were established with certainty for at least three sets on the faces and for three sets on the edges, which were also spatially separated into groups. Such accumulations of 'sets' on the faces and edges of a bone plate or slate are common in this period. Significantly, microscopic analysis will usually reveal differences between such groups and the markings that accumulate on a cutting or hammering surface or those engraved on the flattened bases of bone points and intended for 'gripping' purposes. Such prac- tical marks show a random arrangement, they are all made by one point or they show a random mixing of marks by many points. The example at the Musee des Antiquites Nationales provides additional data concerning the sequence of making and offers us a clue as to the general cognitive nature of these cumulative compositions. Reconstruction of the probable sequence of composition revealed that after each face had been marked with linear sets made in horizontal sequence, groups of dots were added within the areas remaining, but this time in vertical sequence, each dot being made by a twist of the point. This can be verified in the enlarged detail of (Pls. L and LI) where it can be seen that the series of dots are fitted be- tween the unmarked upper border and the linear markings near the lower border. A similar sequential distribution of lines and dots appears on the reverse face. These dots, therefore, represent a terminal use of the slate engraved in an inten- tionally differentiated style. What we seem to have on these two Aurignacian examples, and in this class of Upper Palaeolithic objects, is a visual-kinesthetic system of differentiating accumu- lating sets or groups of marks by the style of stroke, the angle of stroke, the pressure of stroke, the direction of accumulation, and the area of distribution of different groups on the edges and faces of the slate. In addition, the microscope demonstrated that the bone at Saint-Germain had been ochred red after the engraving, since the colour is found deep in each mark on both faces. This perhaps indicates that the bone had a symbolic or narrative content beyond that which would normally apply to a daily, utilitarian object, such as a polisher or knife, or even to a gaming tally. The example in the Saint-Germain museum, then, reveals a complex series of cognitive, visual, and kinesthetic differentiations. The very complexity allows us to make certain tentative deductions concerning the process involved. If we assume a beginning on a blank slate, and accept the fact that there are notational groups, then each group of marks would establish and maintain its identity as the accumulation proceeded. When the maker looked at his 'slate' at any point in that accumulation, he would apparently have been able to reconstruct the 14o</page><page sequence="8">sequence of making, know at which point he was, and evaluate the whole as a series of sets or a 'sum'. When either the bone was completed or a set was finished, the sum or the slate was additionally 'signified', or given a meaning, by ochring. The composition, therefore, must be understood as a time-factored process, rather than as a form of decoration. If this interpretation be valid, then the microscopic analysis of such a notational slate, particularly when the slate is relatively whole and provides the clues for a sequential reconstruction, will show a series of fixed counts made in a limited number of possible orders. It is relatively easy to perform arithmetical and statis- tical tests on these examples to determine whether arithmetical or calendric periodicities occur in the small, separated sets or in the combined sequential sets. The problems involved in such analyses are discussed, in terms of the Gorge d'Enfer bone at the Musee des Antiquites Nationales, in the above-cited monograph.7 In terms of this analysis the fragment in the British Museum seems to repre- sent two early stages of notational accumulation and differentiation: an edge notching and a primary linear marking of the faces. A third example will help to clarify this identification of a specific engraving tradition. Engraved pieces from Aurignacian levels are occasionally found with only edge marks or face marks. Though these are almost always divided into 'sets', they represent only one stage of accumulation and do not serve analytical purposes as well as the more complex pieces. Aurignacian pieces engraved on both edges and faces with marks subdivided into smaller sets, as on the Gorge d'Enfer pieces, are quite common.8 Microscopic analysis of these pieces has revealed that, in every case, the markings and their divisions into sets were made in the manner just described and that the description of these pieces in the literature is inadequate, being indicative and approximate rather than precise and analytical. One of the most important examples of this tradition, comparable in its complexity to the accumulations on the plaques from the Gorge d'Enfer in the collection at the Mus'e des Antiquitis Nationales, comes from the same Dor- dogne region. It is a flattened plaque of roughly the same size and shape. The piece is in the reserve collections of the Musde National de Prdhistoire at Les Eyzies.9 By its style of engraving this piece is apparently from the same Aurignacian period as the bone from the Gorge d'Enfer; it certainly represents an example and a development of that tradition. The fragment (6.5 cm.) is engraved on both faces and the edges (Figs. 3-5, Pls. LII and LIII).IO It is in a better state of general preservation than either bone from the Gorge d'Enfer, has not been coated with preservative, and is therefore more explicit in its microscopic data. Microscopic analysis of the bone revealed that it had been made into a 'slate' out of a larger object by a long deep intentional cutting along one face after I4I</page><page sequence="9">which the fragment was cracked and broken off. Whatever the original purpose of the whole flattened bone, the fragment was then used as a 'slate'. Analysis of the markings revealed that they consisted of variations in the notational manner just described. Because of the complexity and the analysis that it makes possible, the bone can serve admirably as the 'type' for the developing Upper Palaeolithic tradition. Both faces are engraved with groups of linear marks made near the rim or border. The marks on face number one are longer and somewhat further from the edge than those on face number two (Figs. 3 and 4 and Pls. LII and LIII). On the first face, where there is little space left for central marking, two groups of lightly engraved linear marks at bottom right are over-engraved at an angle by later sets of deeper linear marks, resembling but not quite forming the well- known 'hatched effect'. The numerical count of these over-engraved lines does not quite match that of the original series. On the second face the linear marks are shorter and a secondary engraving is, therefore, made between the rows, a process that is cognitively comparable to the tertiary use of dots on the 'slate' from the Gorge d'Enfer. In addition, there is one sequence of nine light marks along the top border which is over-engraved by a set of three deep marks made by another point and rhythm and at another angle. Both edges are notched with groups of marks that are intentionally separ- ated by blank spaces and are also made by different points, at different angles and rhythms, and by different pressures (Fig. 5 and P1. LIV). It is obvious from internal and the comparative analysis that this marking is part of a non-decorative, visual-kinesthetic system of notational accumulation. The author has shown elsewhere that this system of accumulating groups persists and develops through the Magdalenian and into the MesolithicII and he has been able to document the stylistic and technical steps in the development. LATE MAGDALENIAN (C. 15,000-10,000 B.C.) In the early stages of the Upper Palaeolithic, the animal representations and notations were usually engraved separately on different artifacts. Beginning in the Late Aurignacian and Perigordian, however, and increasingly as one moves up the stratigraphic levels, one finds compositions in which engraved notational groups are intentionally associated with the representations of animals, human figures, and abstract signs and symbols. In the British Museum there is the fragment of a point or rod (5-8 cm.) excavated from a Late Magdalenian level at the site of Trou des Forges, Bruni- quel (P1. Lv). It contains the engraved forepart and head of an insect, apparently an ant. The marks are made in a manner common to the period and have been traditionally termed decorative or symbolic.'2 Each mark is made by a double stroke which creates an image resembling the apex of an angle: d. 142</page><page sequence="10">If the composition, including the marks and the insect, is accepted as 'decora- tive', it remains an odd, curious piece. But when the marks are analysed in terms of the evolved tradition of which it is a part, and when the 'insect' image is put within the repertoire of representations associated with this particular late form of marking, new data and relevancies appear. The fragment is one of the simplest examples of a class of composition that has been found in Late Mag- dalenian Franco-Cantabrian levels at Teyjat, Laugerie-Basse, Gourdan, Mas d'Azil, and La Vache, as well as Bruniquel.'3 In every example there is a com- parable block of notational marking in the same, general angular style which is associated with, but separated from, the image. The repertoire of representations includes an insect, plants, a possible 'feather', a fish head, seals, the rear flippers of a seal, the legs of a frog, an anthropomorphic figure, conventionalized horse heads, and a composition with four stag heads whose antlers are in various stages of development. In every case the notations have been added to or over-engraved by later groups of marks made by other points in a tradition whose simple origins lie in the Aurignacian/Perigordian. In each example the associated representa- tional images are different not only from each other but also from the body of representational images found on the engraved bones and pebbles of the same period, often containing 'killed' food animals and no associated notations. The class here under discussion was apparently composed with another, specialized symbolic intent. Microscopic analysis of the Bruniquel fragment reveals that the angular marks are multiple, made by at least one but often two or more strokes added at an angle to the primary stroke (Pls. LVI-LVIII). In this late tradition a block of nota- tion often begins or ends with a set of three or more long strokes made by a dif- ferent point and at a different angle. One of these is shown in the detail, P1. LVIII. In addition, after the primary border sequences have been engraved, a third series of marks is often added between these rows by another point and at a different angle, a technique whose origins we have also seen in the Aurignacian examples. One of these mid-way marks made by a different point is shown in P1. LVIII. The full, schematic rendering of the fragment is presented in Fig. 6. To show the complex nature of such marking, which may be deduced only from microscopic and comparative analysis of examples in this class, I illustrate a comparable fragment of a bone rod recently excavated from the Magdalenian VI levels of La Vache (Fig. 7). It shows the legs of a frog or an anthropomorph, three long deep strokes that separate the image from the area of notation, and then a notational grouping made by adding groups of strokes by other points and other angles to the primary series.I4 Exactly this style of multiple angular marking is found also on a piece from Bruniquel.Is As we have seen, notation by its nature consists of sequential and therefore 'time- factored' seriation. The representations that are associated with the notation I43</page><page sequence="11">in this class of Late Magdalenian composition may thus also be considered 'time-factored', though the nature of that relation will require exhaustive analysis. To begin with, the one aspect common to these images, representing plant, antlered herbivore, sea mammal, fish, feather, insect, and amphibian, is an apparent seasonality or periodicity in their habits of appearance or disappear- ance from the environment. If statistical and arithmetical analyses of the notations can determine their intent and significance, as has been suggested by the author, the relation of a 'time-factored' repertory of images to a 'time-factored' notation will make possible a still higher level of comparison and interpretation. SUMMARY By internal and comparative analysis of two fragments, Aurignacian and Magdalenian, the author has attempted to indicate certain aspects of the range and complexity of Upper Palaeolithic engraving and the possibilities inherent in a new methodology and technology. The presence of a developing tradition of notation has been indicated from the earliest to the terminal stages of the Upper Palaeolithic, essentially a visual-kinesthetic form of accumulation and differentiation. Associated with and related to these symbolic groups of unit marks are images and symbols. A.
