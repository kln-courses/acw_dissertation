<plain_text><page sequence="1">Social Aspects of H uman-Computer Interaction William Lynch Research and policy responses to the growing reali- ty of educational computing have paid little atten- tion to the social role of computers in the curricu- lar world-as-lived. When the computer is seen strict- ly as a technical medium for the communication of ideas, its symbolic quality as a cultural form goes unexamined and unrecognized. This article discus- ses the social role that computers play in the cul- ture of the classroom and exhorts technologists, curriculum planners, and policy-makers to consider the possible role that computers can have on social as well as intellectual development. Background In the typical approach to characterizing the machine's role in the classroom the computer is cast as neutral, as a tool to enhance, train, or ex- plore the user's ability to think (Taylor, 1980). Numerous authors have argued that communica- tions technologies as cultural products are not neu- tral. Cultural products change human beings even as they are being made and used by them (McLu- han, 1964; Williams, 1974; Weizenbaum, 1976). Humans are not simply reactive to their environ- ment, they are interactive, constantly altering sym- bolic reality through interaction with the newly created world. How does this happen? • Is there an identifiable set of relationships be- tween humans and computers? • Is the computer a social entity which partici- pates in the construction of reality through its interaction with human users? • Does interaction with a computer alter the user's perspective on the world or about themselves? There can be little doubt that there is a social relationship between humans and many of their tools. People define themselves in terms of their William Lynch is Director of the Educational Technology Leadership Program at The George Washington University, Washington, D.C. primary tools and often develop intensely personal relationships with them. Consider how adolescents feel about their automobiles, or musicians about their instruments; we assign names to objects, yell at and cajole them, sleep with them, and often al- low them to supplant more difficult relationships with other humans. The 'intelligent' roles filled by computers as experts, teachers, knowledge engi- neers, and problem solvers is prima facie evidence that these machines are more than just tools. If we admit that humans and computers do have social relationships, we must recognize that there is a community of computers and humans which can be constituted and studied as a social group (Fields, 1987; Woolgar, 1985; Bolter, 1984). Even if computers can be considered as social players, can they be subjected to the kind of analy- sis typically used to characterize humans? Certain- ly gender differences should be examined, as should class origins and orientation, racial and ethnic membership, economic status, cultural experiences, personality traits, world view and, of course, ac- cess to power and authority. Do computers have these characteristics? The computer is a reflective medium, in some ways similar to other reflective media like films, television, radio, recordings, paintings, even books. Reflective in this case means that the medium car- ries forth certain personal characteristics of the authors, directors, performers, and editors respon- sible for production. Computer hardware and soft- ware production is the result of enormous effort on the part of engineers, authors, programmers, and even marketing people. A particular computer, its basic operating system, and any software which will work on that computer reflect an individual's or group's personality, values, beliefs, and life ex- periences in some combination. Thus, when a user interacts with a computer he/she is interacting with the physical device, to be sure, but more so with the designers of the apparent intelligent behavior that a machine displays. The designers all have ra- cial, gender, class, economic, and philosophical characteristics which are predictably reflected in the work they do and the products they create. If other communication mediums are reflective, what then is unique about the computer such that it elicits powerful responses from its users? Books certainly evoke emotions, elicit responses, and car- ry forth the personality and experiences of the author, as do television and radio productions. Computers, however, represent the only reflective medium which is also interactive. Interactive can best be understood as the potential for the user of the computer to participate or influence the com- puter's response(s). Books, films, recordings, and television are one-way communication devices. 26 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/April 1 990</page><page sequence="2">While each can elicit a response from the user, none can respond specifically to that user; whereas a computer with appropriate software can respond in innumerable ways to the varying responses of the user. Only living things have similar capabilities and it is precisely this characteristic, this similarity to 'aliveness', which allows a relationship to be es- tablished between human and machine. It is critical to recognize the personal implica- tions of reflectivity and interactivity in educational settings. As a reflective device, the computer serves as a projector of the self; but the image that is re- flected to the user is interactively produced, involv- ing the minds that created the projector as well as the user's. Thus, the image of the mind that is ex- perienced is one of the mind in a relationship with other minds; a social image. This is precisely the image of the self that is available to individuals in other social situations; it is a mediated image. The concept of the mediated image suggests that if the changing social role of the user is to be understood, the social role of the computer must also be under- stood. How then can the computer be understood from a social perspective? The interaction of human beings occurs at a point of contact, whether it be visual, auditory, or physical. The interaction can be immediate and direct, as in shaking hands; immediate and mediat- ed, as in a telephone conversation; or deferred and mediated, as in a letter. These points of contact re- flect the human-to-human interface. The interac- tion of humans with machines takes place under similar conditions. In both cases, interaction is most effective when procedures for interaction are known and anticipated. There is, however, another level of interaction which is part of the human-computer interface. Human-computer interaction not only involves the physical point of contact; it also includes temporal, spatial, cultural, and experiential contexts. The human-computer interface is different if one com- puter is shared by thirty students compared to one computer for each of thirty students. Computers may also only be available at specific times and for specific purposes. Furthermore, the beliefs held about computers, ideas about the roles they should and should not play, and the perceived threat or benefit which is offered are also part of the inter- face. In other words, in addition to the obvious dif- ferences in the interface at the physical level, there is a unique dimension to the interface that occurs because individuals encounter it with different backgrounds, attitudes, and beliefs. A standard interface, no matter how well-con- ceived, is not likely to meet the needs of all users. To some extent options can be provided to attend to the social and psychological needs of users, but if not all those needs can be addressed it is impor- tant to recognize that specific values, beliefs, and assumptions are thoroughly embedded in the inter- face itself. Users will be asked to adapt to the inter- face and, implicitly at least, they will be asked to embrace those assumptions. The normative dimen- sions of the interface should not be allowed to exist sub Rosa, they should be revealed and a ratio- nale offered. If the normative dimensions of the in- terface cannot be avoided, they can be identified and be made explicit to students as choices. Even with these efforts at accommodation, those indivi- duals who do not wish to adjust, or who cannot ad- just to a particular interface will likely be perceived as failures with a technology, when the reality will be that what failed was the technology's interface. It should appear reasonably clear that if the social role of the computer in classrooms is to be understood, research will have to begin with the human-computer interface in its ideosyncratic for- mulations. Researchers concerned with the human- computer interface generally assume that the true terminal (end-point) of a computing system is the human user. They argue that the true terminal is al- ready designed and that technology designers can only design according to its characteristics (Bolt, 1984). From this extremely rational approach to design comes the state-of-the-art in human-com- puter interface, the user-friendly computer. Human factors research is scientifically premised and sta- tistically founded, but to assume a universally friendly interface is to assume a degree of uniform- ity among humans that is unrealistic. Shneiderman (1987) points to confusion arising from cultural differences when icons meaningful to the software designer are alien to some communities. The result of the assumption of graphic universality is a lack of recognition that one user's computer friend is another's enemy. An extremely facile operating en- vironment for one user may be the zenith of frus- tration for others. The variability of educational populations (es- pecially those in schools), according to cognitive style and ability, learning style, cultural origin, life experiences, age, gender and race raise a number of interesting questions concerning educational exper- iences in the context of the human-computer in- terface. Is the interface left-brain or right-brain oriented? Does it assume a certain level of cogni- tive ability or prior orientation? Is one learning style favored over another? Is there a cultural bias built into the interface? Is there a class or occupa- tional bias to the interface? Does the age of the user affect success with basic operations? Does the gender of the user influence successful use? Re- search is needed to determine how software biases are managed by real users in educational situations. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/April 1990 27</page><page sequence="3">When researchers are concerned with making conclusions about the human-computer interface, how much experience a person has had with com- puters or a particular system must always be con- sidered. Experience has to be established not only in quantitative terms, such as how many weeks, months or years, but also in the quality of the ex- perience. Often bad experiences with computers lead to significant assumptions about computer use which is difficult to undo and inhibits successful use even with very friendly interfaces. The experi- ence variable alone ought to suggest clearly the diversity with which users encounter a computer interface. A variety of questions can be asked about the human-computer interface in education in order to understand the social dimension of a computer, but how can this be done within the context of a lived curriculum? While both experimental and holistic approaches are necessary for research on computers in educa- tion, the analytic, experimental approach needs to follow more open-ended inquiry "when modes of computer usage are still in the making" (Salomon and Gardner, 1986). Extending this line of reason- ing, one failure of past research efforts with tech- nology has been in asking, "Who learns how much of X?" rather than "Who learns what?" By posing the question in this way the research orientation becomes more interested in curricular outcomes than in instructional effectiveness. Once the uni- verse of what is being learned can be established, experimental style research becomes feasible. When the purpose of the research is to understand the re- lationship between two socially characterized groups, a methodology is required which can reveal the implicit, hidden, and subtle meanings inherent in the interaction between these groups. Computers in Classrooms: An Empirical Study Based on the above theoretical framework an empirical study of human-computer interaction was undertaken during the first four weeks of two semesters. Two classes in a predominantly black ur- ban high school were observed during the first semester, and three undergraduate classes at a pre- dominantly white university were observed during the second. The five groups were chosen because of their diversity in order to establish an overall sense of interactivity patterns among people with signifi- cantly different social characteristics. The decision to look at students' initial experi- ences with computers was made to examine how relationships might evolve through various stages without the encumbrances of previous problems. In addition to systematic observation of the clas- ses, formal interviews were conducted and informal questioning of the students occurred during class time. Field notes and students' responses were an- alyzed for evidence with which to understand the nature of the human-computer interaction in each setting. Obviously, more subject groups would en- hance the tentative findings presented here, but the time intensive methods utilized for data collection and analysis make the going slow, but hopefully, sure. Interaction Characterizations The high school classes included a BASIC pro- gramming class and a computer applications class. In the BASIC course the students were self-describ- ed as middle class. No students' families received public assistance. The BASIC students were college bound and were eager to gain skill in this advanced course. Students in this class used a BASIC inter- preter in an MS-DOS environment. About ten per- cent of the students owned computers and had used them, but the balance had no previous experi- ence except with the direct manipulation style of video games. There was no obvious fear or awe of the computer in this group and students readily took their turn at the machine. Part of the comput- er interface in this class was the human-to-computer ratio of one computer for every two students. Stu- dents were not permitted to work in pairs and did seatwork until it was their turn on-line. The screen interface was that of a command line BASIC interpreter. Students in the BASIC class were not good typists, which slowed their data en- try considerably, and a fair amount of interaction attention was therefore focused on the keyboard. The teacher of the class distributed model pro- grams and exercises, which the students attempted to enter correctly; original programming was writ- ten out as part of the seatwork assignment and was entered on-line. This approach was considered good programming form by the teacher; the result, however, was very little thinking or problem solv- ing on-line. Students tended to spend the entire on-line session concentrating on data entry, which resulted in very little response from the computer and, therefore, little reaction or action on the part of the student. Students in the BASIC class did not view the computer as personable, and their interaction style was typically that of a human with an appliance. Because of the instructional approach used, inter- activity with the computer was kept to a minimum during the time of the observations. Students fo- cused much more on procedural skills involved in learning BASIC than on interaction with the ma- chine. Interviews revealed that students viewed the computer instrumentally; that is, as a means to an end. There was no apparent difference in style be- 28 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/April 1990</page><page sequence="4">tween boys and girls, except that girls tended to be more accurate at keyboarding. The class was al- most evenly divided between boys and girls. Students in the computer applications class were more diverse in their backgrounds and future plans. About thirty percent of this group planned on col- lege and were taking the course to help them in college. Seventy percent were more immediately career oriented and were enrolled as a means to im- proving their personal marketability for some kind of clerical position. Students described themselves as middle class or lower middle class; fifty percent of the families represented received some kind of public assistance. No students in this class owned a computer, but again most had experience with some kind of video game. Every student in this class worked at a Apple II microcomputer workstation, and there was virtual- ly no seatwork. The substance of the class consist- ed of learning to operate the equipment and the AppleWorks application software. AppleWorks is an integrated software package which includes a word-processor, data-base, and spreadsheet. The software is designed so that information from one tool can be moved to other tools to facilitate re- port production, and multiple documents can be opened at once. Instruction in this class consisted of an explanation of the software tools and prac- tice using the software. Students were given assign- ments to complete and protocol sheets describing the necessary keystrokes to complete a particular operation. AppleWorks uses cursor and function keys to en- able direct manipulation of menu options and edit- ing tasks. In addition, a screen metaphor of file folders is used to indicate the nested relationship of AppleWorks functions and files. This character- istic of the software interface is designed to give users a sense of context within the electronic world of the computer. The teacher in this class intro- duced the folder metaphor early in the class, but never returned to it, preferring to rely on a pro- cedural protocol approach to operations. Predict- ably, most students relied exclusively on the pro- tocols and never developed a sense of how to use the metaphor to help them navigate through the software. When asked about the desktop metaphor, stu- dents responded to the effect that they did not understand why the "lines" file metaphor were there or that they were a frame around the screen. When asked how they knew what to do when con- fronted with an assignment, the typical response referred to the instruction sheet, which outlined the steps procedurally. Students in this class refer- red to the computer as a more dynamic entity in the classroom than did the BASIC group. Responses centered around what the computer "did" and how it "did it." The computer was referred to as capable of action and response, but only the pro- noun "it" was used. While the machine seemed to participate more in the classroom action, students in this class clearly viewed the computer as the sub- ject of instruction. The user interface did not ap- peal to any students in this group at the personal level. The third group studied was a collection of three computer literacy classes at a private university. The classes were composed primarily of white middle to upper middle class students ranging in ages from nineteen to twenty-one. Ten percent of the students in the classes were born in so-called third-world countries and had completed their pre- collegiate education in their home country. Only the foreign born students were receiving financial aid of any kind. Most of the students were plan- ning a career in teaching; other majors represented included business administration, marketing, tour- ism, and psychology. Several software packages were demonstrated during this class, but of particular interest was Microsoft Works, an integrated software package much like AppleWorks except that a graphing tool and communications package are included. In addi- tion, students had the opportunity to use versions of this software on both the IBM/PS2 and Macin- tosh systems. Instead of protocols, however, the in- structor encouraged the students to experiment and explore capabilities of the software, after of- fering an overview and demonstration of the soft- ware design. Students in this class readily adapted to the combination keystrokes necessary to manipulation of the pull-down menus and select options on the IBM system and, although miscues were frequent at first, they were largely eliminated by the end of the fourth week of study. When asked, all but two of foreign born students were able to explain the organizational scheme of the interface and offer both complimentary as well as critical comments on its usefulness. Initially, three students in the classes requested the equivalent of the protocol approach observed in the AppleWorks class; the instructor refused to supply these and instead encouraged the students to practice certain skills with the aid of their text- book. By the end of the fourth week these stu- dents were slower than the rest of the class, but seemed to have improved. Students in this class audibly responded to the computer on occasion, but usually in terms of frustration. Positive rela- tions with the computer were expressed out loud when a surprise was involved, such as finding a hid- den feature. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/April 1990 29</page><page sequence="5">Conclusions • Was there an identifiable set of relationships between humans and computers? Relation- ships with the computers existed in all cir- cumstances; however, what was observed in the BASIC and Applications classes was not a personal relationship, but clearly that of a person to a machine. In the Computer Liter- acy classes, students were much more orient- ed to working with the hardware. Although they did not refer to the computer as a per- son, they did admit to thinking of it in a human role, often as an assistant. Most of the computer literacy students also acknowledged that they thought of the machine having an existence of its own. None of the groups acknowledged any recognition of values or biases embedded in the computer interface, but all felt that the designers and program- mers were probably white, middle-class, and in their thirties. The obvious values in the human-computer interface were in the con- text of the students' expectations and the teacher's instructional approach, each of which resulted in a far different experience and different type of relationship for the dif- ferent groups of students. • Did interaction with the computer constantly alter the user's perspective? In the BASIC and Computer Applications classes examined, the computer did not appear to alter the user's perspective about much. Some evidence sug- gested that students could see their content work (e.g., BASIC or writing) differently through the lens of the computer. Perhaps most significant, however, was the develop- ment of a symbolic quality attached to the use of the computer. As members of all the groups acquired skill with operating the ma- chine, they exhibited a self-esteem correlated with this accomplishment. The computer was figuratively worn like a badge of achievement. The fact that they could master the operation of the computer symbolically indicated a per- sonal quality which they found satisfying and changed their place in the world. • Was the computerà social entity which partici- pated in the construction of reality through its interaction with human users? The ques- tion suggests that an influential relationship existed between the computer and the human user, but none was observed or detected. Stu- dents did not appear to develop a clearer or different sense of themselves because of their interaction with the computer. Summary and Discussion The conclusions that emerged from the collected data seemed to support the contention that rela- tionships with computers do occur, but it also sug- gests that these relationships do not have to be per- sonal and, in fact, initially are not. In addition, teaching style and curricular objectives appear to have an obvious influence on the nature of the re- lationship that is possible for students to develop. When the computer is positioned and clearly treat- ed as a tool, it will in all likelihood be perceived as one by the students. Contributing to the tool image is the stripped down non-anthropomorphic screen interface which characterizes some software and hardware platforms. The Macintosh data seem to indicate that the more inviting the perceptual and physical interface, the more likely students are to see the computer as possessing a personality of a sort. Unfortunately, the variation in teaching ap- proaches and in perceptual and physical interface designs, and the differences in basic social charac- teristics of the study groups cast a shadow over the above conclusions. It is clear that any one or a combination of these characteristics could have led to the between-group differences recognized. Fur- thermore, new users may not be the best group to study when looking for a recognition of relation- ships. It is possible that human-computer relation- ships take time to grow and mature. Experienced users may provide better information on this idea. It is also possible that the 16-22 age group studied is not particularly open to developing the kind of relationships discussed. The issues involved in the social dimension of human-computer interaction are many and may be difficult to identify in all of their complexity, but this should not discourage technology professionals from being concerned with their importance. In the least, thoughtfulness and careful decision-mak- ing regarding the social aspects of software and hardware interfaces is necessary to the conscious design of computing experiences. □ References Bolt, R.
