The Suppliants are being chased by the sons of Aegyptus, unwelcoine suiit- ors. Together with Danaus, their father and prudent counselor, they have fled from Egypt to Argos, their ancestral home. They have made a safe voyage across the sea, and though hotly pursued, they have evaded capture. So far, so good; they have no reproaches to make against the gods. But still they are pursued, still in danger. Taking refuge at the altars of Argos, they make long prayers to the gods, and to Zeus par- ticularly. He is their ancestor; he is the protector of suppliants. It is only just that he should hear them. At line 40 they begin a long ode. First they invoke the AZov 7r6prv (Epaphus) and tell of their ancestry. Some proofs they offer now, others though unex- pected now will (they say) appear later. Then with a shift of mood, they com- pare their complaint to that of a night- ingale. Self-pity leads straight to an appeal to the justice of their ancestral gods: &amp;'CXX&amp;C o ye e?XL X).U?vT) ?5 T 8&amp;xaLov 1806T?4. They pray that the gods shall not ac- complish the purposes of Aegyptus' sons and plead that an altar (such as the one by which they are standing) is a protection even for fugitives in war.

After this, they sing how Zeus easily and without effort casts men down from their too high hopes and pray that Zeus may have regard to the insolent be- havior of the sons of Aegyptus. Later (160) they say that if Zeus does not grant their prayer they will hang themselves at the altars, and Zeus will no longer be thought just. But may Zeus hear! II.

GENERAL IMPLICATION OF STROPHE Few or no editors have doubted that in lines 86-95 Aeschylus says, amongst other things, that Zeus moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform. But Paley for one misunderstood the application of this sentiment to the dramatic situation. Paley interprets: "And yet our [the Suppliants'] hopes may be disappointed as hunman hopes often are: for the coun- sels of Zeus are not easily divined," and he compares line 1058. But it is nmuch more probable that the Suppliants al- lude here to the hopes of the sons of Aegyptus, to their own only by dra- matic irony. They mean rather "the sons of Aegyptus are likely to be disap- pointed in their quest." For the prevailing tone is one of con- fidence, of confidence in the power of god to protect the suppliant and abash proud men. The Suppliants have just said: "An altar protects even fugitives in war." They are just going to say: WrTCL E;' eX7'C0'v ocY' U4)lupywv itacvw Xtc Ppo-rou', where the high hopes are more appropriate to the sons of Aegyptus than to the Suppliants. It is true that in lines 1043ff. the Sup- pliants seriously doubt whether Zeus will accomplish all their own wishes. But that doubt is a surprise point, oc- curring at the end of the play and lead- ing on to the rest of the trilogy. It would not be in place here, except insofar as Aeschylus by dramatic irony implies that the Suppliants' hopes are just as vain as those of Aegyptus' sons. A linguistic point illustrates the dif- ference between lines 1043ff. and our present passage. Both passages stress that destiny is both inevitable and un- predictable. But in one case the charms of women are powerless to affect des- tiny; destiny is therefore called a&amp;Oextov (1055). In the other case, the chasing of men is ineffective;2 so Aeschylus says that Zeus's purpose is oux 7) The general idea here is, more prob- ably: "May god ordain truly well; [he is 'ikely to, for] Zeus's purpose is not easy to hunt and capture." IV. LINE 86 As it stands, this line lacks a subject, and e'Le'n is nonsensical. Many emen- dations have been tried. Some of the attempts involve harsh punctuation, as for instance that of Wilamowitz. I should prefer to leave 87 without punc- tuation, as it looks like a yvc4yq in its own right. There are two possible lines of emen- dation. First, 86 very possibly expressed a wish, either 'L 0?'n O6 ru 7ravmX-nO6 (Schuetz), or ru 8' e' At6Ovv (others), or the like. The sense would be: "May god ordain truly well; [he is likely to, for], etc." This is perhaps the easiest solution and involves the fewest dif- ficulties. But it fits somewhat awkward- ly into the context, after the preceding antistrophe; also it gives us two dis- jointed sentences in 86-87, with differ- ent subjects, followed by three lines which take up the subject of 87 only. Secondly, the optative could form part of a condition (rather similar to the optatives which occur sometimes in generalizations, e.g., Soph. Ant. 666, Hom. Od. 1. 47, 6. 286). The text might be: et 8' e't AL-o The Suppliants have just said that an altar is a protection even for fugitives in war. Now they say: "And if a desire be well and truly the desire of Zeus, Zeus's desire is not a thing that can be hunted down." This would contain the implication that the Suppliants are well</page><page sequence="3">AESCHYLUS "SUPPLICES" 86-95 23 and truly descended from Zeus, and are therefore unlikely to be captured. One might compare Supplices 584-89. But the e6 remains difficult, even if we com- pare the vague use of this word at Sup- plices 175, 233, 528, 1065. V. ETeHPATOE There is some difficulty over the meaning of eU0npoTOq. One thing seems plain. There is almost certainly a con- nection of thought between oux Ou&amp;npa- -roq and xodv axoTc. Darkness, as the Greeks knew, makes hunting difficult: a5uawrkT ye Ttq O T6woq aVeTaL xt 7ctLaXLO4- CT yQuV aXOTLVO4 xOCL u- atepeuMwTO0 (Plato Rep. 432 C). The connection should be: "Zeus's desire is difficult to hunt; for it blazes every- where, in the dark too (just as much as in the light)." The xcxt is no objection to this theory; if the desire blazes as often as not in the dark, then the general observation that it is difficult to hunt is legitimate. The "everywhere" includes "in the dark too." But we should not take it for grant- ed that oi'x euONpocroq means "hard to track down, hard to discover." This is the way most editors have taken it. Weil demurred and produced a new interpretation: "Jovis voluntas (At&amp;o ,urpos i.e., 8 At ptLov ia-rtv) non facile expugnatur (Itaque Jove favente Aegyptiadae me non caperent. Hoc respiciens voce eUONYpc0q4 potius quam e1vuxa,roc, usus esse videtur)." The more usual interpretation is sup- ported by Pindar (Frag. 61 [33]), where a similar idea is expressed with epeuv&amp;co; and by some instances in Plato, where Plato uses O-pi'co to mean "seek to dis- cover" (Phcaedo 66 A, 3uaO-pu'VTOV at Soph. 218 D, Euthyd. 290 C). According to the argument of my preceding sec- tion, it should imply that it is not easy lor the pursuers to be sure about Zeus's purpose. Zeus may spring an unpleasant surprise which will thwart their chase. There are some difficulties involved in this interpretation. First, if the im- plication is that the chase will be thwarted, does not that at once suggest a slightly different meaning for OU'Npx- roq ? Secondly, Npo'o in Greek tragedy4 always means "hunting with a view to capture or acquisition"; even in Plato this idea of "acquisition" seems to re- main uppermost.5 Eu0Npoc-o4, in the two other instances quoted in LSJ9, means "easily caught." Would Aeschy- lus' audience have understood that he meant "obtaining with the miind" ? Note the other instances in Aeschylus (Cho. 493 TsAac OcptLeu0c, PV 1072 7rpo6 ar&amp;q 0-%pxoOeZacw). The Ojp6i4a at PV 109 is still a branch of xs~TrtxX (to use the classification of Plato Soph. 219-23). Note also Sophocles' use of the word in connection with fortune and what a man should seek (OC 1026, Ant. 92). But above all note P V 856-59, which appears to be a direct comment on our play: cA ' ?7rtoT0h?(vo 9p)' V6SQ XLpXOL 7???LG)V OV %LcXpiV ?XL%09L~ O "iOuG 0OjpzUOVv' O u 0ipXcat4ouq y&amp;C4ouq, Cpo6vov 8' eae'v 'q. 0e6 It would appear to be desirable, though not essential, that oux OU'iNpTOg should mean much the same as o'u Npocpa4ou (though obviously the 'u- makes a slight difference). Can it ? I think so. "Zeus's desire is not easy to hunt and capture," in this context where the Suppliants are being hunted, could easily mean "Zeus's desire is not an easy prey" (i.e., "our pursuers are not likely to capture us, if Zeus wills otherwise"). This seems a natural mean- ing for Aeschylus, when we consider the rather similar use of a context word in Supplices 1055: "thou wouldst charm the uncharmable," meaning "thou</page><page sequence="4">24 N. B. Boomi wouldst alter the unalterable destiny of Zeus."7 It may also be true that the hunting is a vague metaphor, and that both the suggested meanings are more or less in- volved. VI. CONNECTION OF THOUGHT IN 86-90 Et`Onpo'prog, with its vague basic mean- ing ("well to hutnt, easy to hunt and capture, to be chased with success"), can imply different things according to context. Here I think it implies that Zeus's desire cannot be interfered with by chasing men, 'ind also that the hun- ters are not likely to catch their prey. The sequel, nocvta ToL yp?eyeOet xav axoTcp, continues the hunting metaphor (along the lines suggested at the begin- ning of the preceding section). At the same time it implies that Zeus is always liable to spring an unpleasant surprise which will thwart the chase. There seems to be a reference here to the sub- sequent development of the trilogy. Ka x6- zox implies "sometimes where least expected," and amplifies 7ravta. From the point of view of connection of thought there is mnore stress on ntov'a x&amp;v axoTcp than on y?ey'OeL. (tXsye'Oe is used, I think, partly for an oxymoron effect w-ith xacv axorw, partly also to ex- press the awful majesty of Zeus the lightener. The "darkness" here expres- ses the obscurity of the future, but p.s- XocLtvas v rUZcx may perhaps also imply gloom and death in the future (C. G. Haupt translated "nigra tristique homi- nibus"). MspO'7raaL ?aoq means mor- talibws aegris, as Tucker suggested. VII. THE ANTISTROPHE Thus the essential idea conveyed by lines 86-90 is one of confidence, ac- cording to my view. The Suppliants are confident in the power of Zeus to spring surprises and thwart men's hopes. This tone of confidence continues in the antistrophe: MILTCL a' &amp; acPoris o0'8' bhd xopop ALoq et xpcLVO?. rp&amp;y,ot TO'SOV. If Zeus decides on something, his de- cision is inevitably fulfilled. The next sentence, introduced by yoc,o explains why Zeus's decrees fall surely, and are inevitably fulfilled. It is because the ways8 of his mind are impenetrable: 80CoA . yap 7 tPCM'8(0v gcaxXow re t?LVOUMaV 7rQpOL XO(rL8ezV &amp;.qppmatO. It is not easy to see the logic of this. Why should mystery alone imply power and success? I suppose the first reason is that, if you cannot see a thing happening you cannot interfere with the process. You cannot hunt it down or capture it. Thus would Gyges gain power by means of his ring, Perseus by means of his helmet of invisibility. A secondary idea, implied by this, is that Zeus is a master of the unexpected, and can easily cast men from their high- towering hopes (see 11. 96ff.). A third implication may be seen if we compare nuxvo6 with &amp;zuX6q/ca(xL(o&lt;;. Now AaocA6 and U&amp;axto4 both mean "thick, dense, shaggy," of beards or of woods. fluxvo6 can likewise be applied to woods. Furthermore, the idea of thickness seems to have been associated by the Greeks with the idea of obscu- rity, mystery, even invisibility, e.g., amA\6/M&amp;axto4 here, and xoxo8XU7WX- &amp;TpLa '6vt' "A68oq xuvvv inAristophanes (Ach. 389-90). But xuzxv64 bears another meaning in Homer and in some later authors: the meaning of "wise, shrewd." Density, which implies stupidity to an Englishman, sometimes implied wisdom to a Greek. This was no doubt because the Greeks regarded the wise man as a man of mystery, of uncannywisdom, who always has a further trick up his sleeve</page><page sequence="5">AESCHYLUS "SUPPLICES" 86-95 25 (one may compare the "deep" man in English; the Greeks used PAk in the same sense). If 7nuxv6 bears this meaning in Homer, then we may assume that in our present passage, where ways of the mind are concerned, a0tv6Xo/&amp;acxLoq also irnply uncanny intellectual power.9 If so, then some of the thought of the ensuing strophe would be anticipated by sug- gestion. Is not this idea implied by 99-103 particularly? VIII. CoNCLusIoN Three general points may now be made about the passage as a whole: 1. Zeus omnipotent as well as mys- terious. If evOnpoToq is to be interpreted as I suggested, the whole passage concerns Zeus's omnipotence just as much as his inscrutability. The Suppliants are con- cerned just as much with the inability of their pursuers to affect Zeus's will as with their ignorance of it. Mystery and omnipotence combine: for the Suppliants are concerned with Zeus's power to cast men down from their excessive hopes, by some unex- pected turn of destiny. 2. Zeus the intellect-god. There is possibly some suggestion that Zeus, acting in his capacity of the mysterious controller of destiny, pos- sesses intellectual power beyond the ken of man. If a man is cheated of his hopes, it is because he has not seen far enough into the mind of ZeuLs. One must be cautious here for (a) Zeus's mind is to some extent a mere abstraction for human destiny, and (b) Zeus is still partly anthropomorphic in this play. Nevertheless there seems to be a ten- dency toward the intellect-god of the philosophers. 3. Dramatic relevance of Zeus. Zeus the accomplisher, whose decrees are both inevitable and unpredictable, is mentioned both in lines 86-95 and in 1043ff. Here the dramatic suggestion is that the hopes of the pursuers will be thwarted. In the later passage, which occurs at the end of the play, the validi- ty of the Suppliants' own hopes is brought in doubt. It is likely that both sets of hopes were thwarted in the se- quel; and possibly the solution was one in which was seen the superior wisdom of Zeus. Thus the conception of Zeus that is enunciated here is closely con- nected with the whole plan of the trilogy and the surprising reversals of fortune which occur in it. Ilndeed Zeus as conceived here pre- sides over Greek tragedy and is the theological cause or concomitant of many essential features of the tragic form. Suspense, surprise, dramatic irony are all bound up with his nature being what it is. LEYBURN, YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND NOTES 1.
