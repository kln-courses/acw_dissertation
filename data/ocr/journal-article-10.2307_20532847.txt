<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why Classical Music still Matters. By Lawrence Kramer, pp. viii + 242. (University of Cali fornia Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London, 2007, ?15.95. ISBN 0-520-25082-6.) The plot of this book is transparent, and ele gant. Kramer believes there is some prospect of the slow disappearance of 'classical music', and that the right response is to ask 'why and how classical music should still matter' (p. vii). In the first chapter, he argues the case for the value of classical music, exploring 'some of the distinctive things that classical music can do and that can be done with classical music' (p. 32). What he seems to be saying overall is that classical music fires our imaginations in ways that no other known human activity ever has done. In airing some of the ins and outs of this claim he relies on ontological and epistemological positions that are neither new nor, therefore, particularly striking: his stance amounts to a kind of perfectionism, as political theorists would probably call it, where a vision of what is good for all is taken to be a standard for all, willing or not (among Kramer's exten sive output there is at least one, rather crisp, encapsulation of what might be called his 'aes thetics' of music: see his 'Musicology and Mean ing', Musical Times, 144, no. 1883 (2003), 6-12). Many possible casualties of such aesthetics will come to mind. For example, what happens to unauthorized ways of listening that might suit some 'classical music' better than the prescribed ways (see e.g. David Headlam, 'Learning to Hear Autistically', in Neil Lerner and Joseph Straus (eds.), Sounding Off: Theorizing Disability in Music (London, 2006), 109-20)? Chapter 2, on 'The Fate of Melody and the Dream of Return', seeks to persuade the reader, primed to see where some actual musical value may lie, that melody actually does something, that we can discern what melody is thinking, planning, encountering, and so on, that melody has a des tiny. This is certainly one way to conceptualize music of certain kinds, but the fact that we can tell stories about classical music is one of its least alluring aspects. I for one am not persis tently interested even in my own stories about music, let alone anyone else's. On the other hand, if someone can show me something per 675</page><page sequence="2">suasive about music understood as a kind of narrative in its own, untranslatable 'language', then of course that can be an entirely different matter; it can be worthwhile music analysis. The 'Fate of Melody' does not aspire to that stan dard, and not least because?unbeknownst to the lay reader of course?it flies in the face of professional knowhow, the knowledge that clas sical music consists of more than the sum of its parts, not just of its parts, and certainly not just of one of its parts, 'melody'. Beethoven would have agreed, for sure. So undoubtedly would John Lennon, for instance. Chapter 3, 'Score and Performance, Perfor mance and Film', relays non-contentious points about the music as an 'object', and illustrates from four films where classical music is used in an effective, almost self-explanatory way, though readers who remember these films but had not thought about the music will be inter ested. 'But Not for Me: Love Song and the Heartache of Modern Life' follows through on the interface of music and language, largely through discussion of Schubert's Die sch?ne M?l lerin and Winterreise. While there may be noth ing to detain the Schubert lover or specialist in this chapter, it does offer an intriguing, to some extent evidence-based, answer to the timeless question, aired for instance by Stephen Davies in the form 'Why Listen to Sad Music if It Makes One Feel Sad?' (in Jenefer Robinson (ed.), Music and Meaning (Ithaca, 1997), 242-53). Kramer's answer is akin to Boulez's idea that composers, ideally, speak to us about themselves (Orientations: Collected Writings (London, 1986), 123). All credit to Kramer for clarifying the particular questions at issue in this chapter. Chapter 5, 'The Ghost in the Machine: Key board Rhapsodies', is a celebration of the piano in the hands of Chopin, Schumann, and Ligeti in particular. Kramer wants us to believe that 'the piano decisively changed the relationship between art and technology, not least by making it impossible to ignore' (p. 142), and there is considerable mileage to be gained from that claim in terms of the apparent dichotomy between machine and magic. The phenomenon of the piano as cultural hero has been examined recently, in great detail, by Jim Samson ( Virtu osity and the Musical Work (Cambridge, 2003), although that is not how Samson would describe the phenomenon), in prose every bit as seductive as Kramer's at his best, and with deeply researched evidence, although without political spin. Chapter 6 is pinned on Beetho ven's 'Pastoral' symphony, and the idea of music as a public phenomenon, including in the wake of '9/11'. The central point, I take it, is of music being able to 'confront traumatic change' (p. 204); here, as throughout the book, one has to step outside the anthropomorphic web and remember that it is we ourselves who do such confronting, and without knowing whether the music is catalytic or coeval. Some times the reader can slip into thinking that Kramer somehow believes in the music of the spheres, as if classical music were somehow 'out there' and rather independent of us, which is deeply puzzling when he places such emphasis on human agency in musical perception. The perfectionist does of course always have to live with the fracture between the assertion of human value and being unable to ascribe it to universal human need. Chapter 7, finally, lowers the temperature somewhat, reminding us of some simple home truths. Entitled 'Persephone's Fiddle: The Value of Classical Music', it hinges on Kramer hear ing Bach in a New York subway played by a busker, and he finds three reasons why people stop to listen: because you have to listen; because in doing so you are reoriented; and anyway, and most importantly, because this music 'carries cultural authority' (p. 219). Kramer also mentions that the busker was 'young... blonde, attractive' (p. 206; three pages later Kramer describes the busker as 'pretty[,] middle-class white'?how he knows the busker was not, say, 'upper'-class pretending to be middle-class is a mystery, whatever he thinks 'class' means in modern society). The story may be entertaining to some. Others will be astonished that such a discriminatory and illogical anecdote finds its way through an aca demic press into being reviewed in a scholarly journal. Watch out, old, dark-haired, ugly, Bach-playing buskers who are not being listened to on the subway: your age and appearance could be published evidence any day by a Uni versity of California Press musicologist; 'evi dence', that is, of all things white being a swan. The residual caveat about Kramer's book is whether advocacy can stand pretty much alone, since the account of music here is thin and ques tionable, in a compromise between pure argu ment and empirically backed research. Advocacy perhaps could indeed stand alone in this case, since Kramer is aiming to persuade, rather than to state and demonstrate, if only the questions he is seeking to answer were ob vious. Yet they are not. Kramer belongs to a generation of Western ers for whom classical music seems to have been redefined; they certainly think it has been, al though at least Kramer, unlike Julian Johnson in Who Needs Classical Music? (Oxford, 2002), 676</page><page sequence="3">does not set up popular music as a straw man to be ritually burnt in the supposed cause of music al tradition. There is always a danger among such a generation, sensing significant change, not to know what to make of it, and so to resort to the reassertion of lifelong values. But the world is not now what it was; it never is. Classical music needs to be rethought, espe cially in the light of technology, not as Kramer does here by recycling prides and prejudices from the closing decades of the last millennium, but for the same worthwhile reason as always: to see it for what it is as contemporary culture, insofar as one can. For example, unlike many cultural musicologists I maintain that people who enjoy hearing symphony orchestras now adays playing Hollywood movie scores do not actually think they are listening to 'classical music'. Unlike overexcited cultural gurus, they know what is what. Similarly, many classical music commentators try to colonize popular culture, either in some kind of pan-cultural celebration in a pointless aesthetic vacuum, or to ask grumpily why people may take 'other' musics more seriously than classical music. The interesting question, however, thinking of the title and thrust of this book, is quite dif ferent from Kramer's loosely formed nostalgia: it is why wow-classical music matters so much, as it seems to do. If non-classical music really is taking over?although anyone who claims to know that for sure is in futurologist fantasy? then a book like this, good or bad, will be whis tling in the wind. On the other hand, the asser tion, indeed conviction that 'Beethoven will be around in the future' (see Andrew Thomson's dismissive review of Nicholas Cook's Music: A Very Short Introduction in Any Old Music', Music al Times, 139, no. 1865 (1998), 60) is nothing short of bizarre: we do not even know that West ern civilization will be around in the future rec ognizably or at all. The interesting question, put another way, is why classical music still matters in a globalized culture where rock, pop, and non-Western music, possibly in no particular order, are what many people most care about. And it could even be that there is simply no issue, considering that classical music was formed and developed by statistically tiny sec tors of humankind. The second most astonish ing feature of the human species?after its unspeakable cruelty despite its consciousness? is its ingenuity. If, collectively, it wants classical music to survive inside contemporary culture, then there is every chance that classical music will do so, especially as through technology we can now more or less preserve such art for the first time in about four million years. I would be more inclined to recommend Kramer's book if he had taken himself more seriously. It's one thing to have an instinct for preservation, quite another to get beyond one's personal tics and yearnings to a vision that can provide readers with a sense of cultural substance.
