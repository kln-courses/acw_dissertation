<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Growth of Religion. By HENRY NEL- SON WIEMAN AND WALTER MARSHALL HORTON. Chicago: Willett, Clark and Company, 1938. xviii + 505 pages. $5.00. This joint work by Wieman and Hor- ton was projected years ago when the two authors were much closer together in their thought than they are now. Com- ing as it does now the book is a rather strange phenomenon. Horton's theo- logical views are well known to differ profoundly from the constructive part of this volume written by Wieman but the only indication that the authors differ at all is a very small note in fine print tucked away at the end of a long series of notes. Horton writes the first half of the book which is a masterly survey of the re- ligions of the world. It is more than a survey as it attempts also to discover the distinctive element in high religion in the light of its history. The result is con- tained in this sentence: "The purpose and goal of high religion may be defined as the progressive reorganization of the world into a system of mutually sustain- ing activities humanly appreciated, where- by the endless growth of meaning and value is fostered." This is not the com- mon denominator of all religious pheno- mena but a normative statement of the essential meaning of religion. Both authors agree on this statement. It seems a rather activistic and world-accepting conception of religion in the context of the general history of religion but the chapters on each of the religions are by no means warped by the desire to derive this conception from them but on the con- trary they complete the evidence to show that there is nothing which Horton can- not describe brilliantly and sympathetic- ally. The second part of the book, written by Wieman, is as personal as the first part is objective. That fact keeps the book from being as useful as the basis for a course in religion as the total plan of the book might suggest. Wieman has given us the latest edition of his thought in systematic form. Much of the ground- work is familiar though never has it been put more clearly or persuasively. I doubt if there is anyone Who writes more wisely or more beautifully about the function and practice of religion than does Wieman. His chapters on "The Fact of Religious Living" and "The Method of Religious Living" are superb. As always in every- thing that the author writes there are new statements of the idea of God. Here the emphasis is upon God as "unlimited con- nective growth" or upon God as "the growth of connections between activities which are appreciable." Occasionally Wieman makes a concession to Calhoun's criticisms and says that growth is the work of God but obviously he still pre- fers the statement that God is growth. There are three emphases in this book which seem to me to be marks of develop- ment in Wieman's thought. (1) There is great emphasis upon the idea that the re- ligious way of life must be commitment to an unknown goal. Here there is a curious combination of John Dewey and the Barthians. The good which is some- times called "the will of God" not only transcends every achievement but also every ideal. (2) He arrives by a different route at the same point that Reinhold 35</page><page sequence="2">36 JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION [February Niebuhr does. There is a tendency to use anthropomorphic words with which to describe God. Wieman adheres to his refusal to speak of God as personal or as mind though he is very careful to stress that God is super-personal and not im- personal. But he often speaks of the "love of God," the "fatherhood of God," and the "will of God." (3) Mbre than in any of his other writings, so far as I know, Wieman here emphasizes that God is only one factor in the universe and that we have no way of knowing that God is the dominant factor. I know of no other writer within the Church who writes with such calmness of the prospect of the annihilation of all values in this world and who at the same time rejects personal immortality. Wieman may al- low his religious insights to go beyond his strict method in describing God as supreme value and as a unified super- human actuality which should be the ob- ject of devotion but he stays very cau- tiously umithin the evidence (in fact he suppresses evidence in his contemptuous rejection of all theodicies) when he speaks of the power of God now or in the future. It is in his refusal to regard God as crea- tor and in his extreme view of the limited power of God and not in his views con- cerning God's personality that Wieman departs most from the Christian tradition. Wieman tries to relate his thought at various stages of the discussion to other points of view but he is at his worst in this effort. He deals with what he calls "Neo- supernaturalism" and Liberalism as though each were entirely one-sided with no inner tensions and with no means of self-correc- tion. These positions serve the purpose of foils and when the argument is won they are always taken captive. Wieman as an explorer who tries by strictly limiting himself to see how far one method can take him in order to make a contribution to the total situation, as a relig- ious spirit of rare insight and power, and as a point of contact between Christianity and those who are under the spell of natur- alistic Humanism is making a contribution unsurpassed by anyone in America. But Wieman as a polemical writer and as a crusader for a new system which becomes curiously rigid in its negations is an entire- ly different figure and the light he sheds is a good deal mixed with darkness.
