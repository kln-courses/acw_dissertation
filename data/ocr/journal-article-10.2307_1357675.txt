Tell Sabi Abyad ("Mound of the White Boy") is a primarily Late Neolithic settlement in the Balikh Basin of northern Syria. The work under review consists of two descriptive volumes on the results of the 1988 to 1993 excavation seasons. Volume 1 consists of three chapters dealing with landscape geoarchaeology, stratig- raphy and architecture, and ceramics; Volume II contains seven chapters presenting data on chipped stone, seals, figurines, ground stone, small finds, animal remains, and cultivated plants. The chapters are very detailed and packed with a wealth of data. This is a particularly im- portant work, not only because it provides a large amount of information but also because there is generally a limited amount of detailed data available on the "Late Neolithic" from much of the Near East. Akkermans states in the foreword that the emphasis in these volumes is on "... the description and illustration of the local material culture," noting that the research strategy of the Tell Sabi Abyad Project has been presented elsewhere. In chapter 1, Tony Wilkinson provides an excellent ex- ample of applied geoarchaeology with a preliminary in- terpretation of the landscape around Tell Sabi Abyad. He uses archaeological, pedological, and geomorphological data for an integrated assessment of landscape develop- ment. Wilkinson first provides a detailed description of soil landscape units, based largely on air-photo interpreta- tion and field studies. This analysis suggests that the area around the site has been subjected to steady, low-energy silt-plain aggradation. One consequence of this situation is that in some parts of the project area, sedimentation has obliterated landscape features and may have obscured small archaeological sites as well. This discussion provides the geomorphic background for subsequent analysis. Wilkinson then addresses the cultural landscape in some detail. This is an interesting discussion, as it puts Tell Sabi Abyad within a wider regional context. His many insightful observations may be useful for interpret- ing cultural activities. In particular, the discussion on the canal system provides much to contemplate. As but one example, the presence of querns along branches of the ca- nal system suggests to Wilkinson that cereals were brought from the fields to the canal banks where milling took place prior to distribution along the canal network. He further indicates that the presence of abundant water may have been useful for soaking grain and producing crushed wheat at these miling points. Equally interesting is his treatment of roads in the region. Wilkinson concludes with a discussion of how soil and landscape mapping has allowed for an interpretation of cultural activity on the landscape around Tell Sabi Abyad. In particular, his analysis contributes to dialogue on irri- gation versus rain-fed cultivation patterns in the region, the potential use of marshes for cultivation, and the im- portance of both canal and road systems. This type of research goes beyond the site and allows us to make well- reasoned regional interpretations. Chapter 2 is a very detailed discussion of site stra- tigraphy and architecture by Marc Verhoeven and Peter Kranendonk, with a discussion on human remains by Nico Aten. Attention is focused on the southeastern portion of the tell, where the emphasis was on broadscale exposure of the Halaf occupation levels and their immediate pre- decessors to provide insight into Late Neolithic settlement organization and use of space. Based on stratigraphy and limited radiocarbon dates, the earliest levels at Sabi Ab- yad date to ca. 5700 B.C., while the youngest date to ca. 5000 B.C. (uncalibrated). Analysis of 11 major strati- graphic levels suggests that the site, or at least the south- eastern portion of it, was occupied continuously during the Late Neolithic. There appear to be no major breaks in occupation, with the possible exception of one between Levels 11 and 10. Essentially, the occupation of the tell has been divided into three major phases: pre-Halaf, tran- sitional, and Early Halaf. This chapter outlines the prehistoric sequence at the site in a level-by-level discussion. Each level is described both by stratigraphy and by architectural features. There is much to digest in this chapter, and considerable atten- tion is paid to the complex architectural composition of the site. In particular, the discussion of Level 6, or the so-called "Burnt Village," offers considerable information on village make-up and spatial patterning. Of great im- portance is the discovery of numerous clay sealings with stamp-seal impressions and small tokens in Room 6 of Building II of this level. These finds indicate an early but apparently well-developed system of recording and administration. Especially useful throughout the chapter is the com- bination of architectural photographs, plan views, ax- onometric reconstructions, and artistic reconstructions of major periods of occupation at the tell. These provide a visual representation that often is difficult to express with words. At the end of chapter 2, Nico Aten presents brief notes on the human remains uncovered during excavation. This section is largely descriptive; more contextual data are 79</page><page sequence="2">80 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 312 provided in the previous discussion on a level by level basis. While chapter 2 contains a wealth of data, it nearly suffers from information overkill. What is presented is very important, but it is easy to get lost in the detailed descrip- tion. A summary at the end of the chapter, outlining the building and occupational sequence level by level would have been particularly useful. Chapter 3 presents a model discussion on the pottery by Marie Le Mikre and Olivier Nieuwenhuyse. Although the authors consider this only an "extensive preliminary report," it is quite detailed. They deal with a large ceramic assemblage of over 70,000 pieces of pottery. Originally, the ceramics recovered during the first season of excava- tion were considered to belong to two different periods- Late Neolitic and Early Halaf-thought to be separated by a hiatus in settlement. Additional excavations, how- ever, demonstrated a continuous occupational sequence and provided a much larger ceramic assemblage for analysis. The newer excavations also focused on the pre- Halaf occupation. In chapter 3, the authors' goals are to describe the most recently excavated ceramics from pri- marily pre-Halaf contexts; to establish the chronological positioning of the ceramics, both locally and regionally; and to contribute to a better understanding of the strati- graphic sequence. Discussion in chapter 3 focuses on Levels 11-7, the Balikh II or pre-Halaf period, Levels 16-4, the Balikh IIIA or transitional period, and Levels 3-1, the Balikh IIIB or Early Halaf period. Each of these sections provides a consistent analysis format and data presentation. In addi- tion, the conclusion of each section presents a welcome discussion of the wider significance of the ceramics from each period. This goes beyond a short summary and pro- vides insightful comments on the regional context of the Tell Sabi Abyad ceramics. Volume 2 begins with chapter 4, in which Lorraine Copeland presents a typically detailed and thorough anal- ysis of flint and obsidian materials. This is a particularly useful analysis since this chipped stone has not often been adequately analyzed in the past for Late Neolithic assem- blages. While one might find a few points to quibble over, such as classifying flint and obsidian materials separately due to presumed technological and typological differences, Copeland's treatment is well conceived. Her clear defini- tions are especially welcome, partially relating to rela- tively rare classes such as "tile knives" or "corner thinned blades," which are not widely described. Copeland's all too brief comparisons to other assemblages also provide a useful compendium. What I find somewhat odd about the Tell Sabi Abyad chipped stone assemblage, however, is its small size: slightly over 6,000 artifacts seems small for a Neolithic village. Chapter 5 presents an intriguing analysis by Kim Duistermaat of stamp seals and sealings. While actual stamp seals are rare at the site, hundreds of sealings, or "... lumps of clay either pressed on the fastening of a container or closing this container entirely" (p. 341) were recovered. In addition to a thorough discussion of these materials and reconstructing the types (e.g., ceramics, basketry, ground stone, leather bags, etc.) of vessels that were sealed, Duistermaat provides compelling insights into the social and trade significance of the sealings. In chapter 6, Pieter Collet describes figurines. This is a short but straightforward discussion of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines. The majority of these artifacts came from the "Burnt Village" levels, and, curiously, all human figurines represent women whose heads have been broken off. Most of the animal figurines represent bovine forms, one of which bears a striking resemblance to "ritu- ally killed" cattle figurines recovered from the huge Pre- Pottery Neolithic B settlement of CAin Ghazal in central Jordan (p. 406). Chapter 7, by Pieter Collet and Richard Spoor, de- scribes the ground stone artifacts, which were numerous, as would be expected from an agricultural village. Discus- sion focuses on grinding slabs, mortar, grinder, and pes- tles as a major grouping. Other ground stone types include celts, chisel, maceheads, and miscellaneous objects. A variety of miscellaneous small finds are described by Richard Spoor and Pieter Collet in chapter 8. These include the ubiquitous spindle whorls, as well as discs, tokens, beads, pendants, labrets, sling missiles, miscella- neous clay objets, white ware, copper ore, bone implements, and several large and curious clay artifacts interpreted as "ritual" objects. Some of these objects contained sheep or bovid bones that were placed in position while the clay was still wet. Chapter 9 is a preliminary, but quite detailed, account of the animal remains by Chiara Cavallo. A large faunal as- semblage was recovered, although it is not in very good condition. Cavallo carefully discusses taxonomic issues be- fore describing the remains. These are discussed in terms of percentages of the total faunal assemblage, and not by Minimal Number of Individuals (MNI). While I understand that many zooarchaeologists choose not to use MNI, I am a bit uncomfortable with raw counts and percentages for describing predominant species. With this said, however, Cavallo provides a very useful discussion on the faunal re- mains. Not surprisingly, ovicaprines are the majority of identified species. Realizing the difficulties of separating sheep from goat bones, Cavallo nonetheless provides a useful breakdown of these species, suggesting that goat increases through time. Somewhat more surprising is the diversity of other species represented: cattle, pig, dog (one bone of which showed traces of possible filleting), equids, gazelle, fallow and red deer, hyena, brown bear, fox, hare, rodents (possibly intrusive), tortoise, mollusks and fish (one bone!), and a variety of avifauna. Cavallo ends the chapter with brief, but quite useful, concluding remarks. The final chapter, 10, is an excellent discussion of cul- tivated and wild plants by Willem zan Zeist and Wille-</page><page sequence="3">1998 BOOK REVIEWS 81 mina Waterbok-van Rooijen. This is a typically thorough and well thought out presentation. It not only describes the abundant botanical remains, but also addresses issues related to food-plant proportions, grain storage (convinc- ingly discounting the tholoi at the site as storage facili- ties), and the ecological and economic implications of the wild plants, especially as the latter relate to the weed flora, river valley vegetation, and fuel collecting. In conclusion, these volumes of the 1988-1993 Tell Sabi Abyad excavations contain a plethora of useful data. Production quality is uniformly high, and each chapter is well-illustrated. Unfortunately, virtually nothing of the project's research design or wider significance is pre- sented in these pages. While this is intentional, as the editor makes clear in the foreword, a concluding sum- mary chapter would have been a welcome addition. These restrictions make the volumes more of a reference work for specialists interested in details of the Late Neolithic of northern Syria, with the possible exception of Wilkinson's broader focused geoarchaeological study. This comment certainly is not intended as a criticism, and the present volumes stand as a model for proper publication of de- tailed site data, which is a dilemma facing the discipline. The data are well presented in these volumes; but to fully appreciate the significance of Tell Sabi Abyad in a wider context, the reader will have to turn to other publications, particularly Akkermans's Villages in the Steppe: Later Neolithic Settlement and Subsistence in the Balikh Valley, Northern Syria (Ann Arbor: International Monographs in Prehistory 1993).
