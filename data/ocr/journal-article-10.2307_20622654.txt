The Oldowan Indus trial Complex documents the first definitive evidence of early hominin culture as well as the earliest known archaeological record. This review examines our state of knowledge about the Oldowan and the hominin tool makers who produced this archaeological record and compares and contrasts these patterns with the technological and cultural patterns of modern apes, especially chimpanzees and bonobos. Of special interest are methodological approaches that can attempt to make direct compar isons between the early archaeological record and modern ape material culture, including a long-term collaborative experimental program in teaching modern apes to make and use stone tools. 289</page><page sequence="2">Oldowan Industrial Complex: the earliest stage of human technology, consisting of simple percussors, cores, retouched pieces, flakes, and fragments (~2.6 1 Mya).

Palaeolithic research into aspects of early stone tools has now been carried out for well over 150 years (research into the Oldowan for more than 50 years), including excavation and documentation of early sites and stone ar tifact assemblages in Africa, Europe, and Asia, as well as a variety of laboratory and experimen tal studies exploring their significance. Aware ness of chimpanzee tool use in the wild began to emerge approximately 50 years ago, after GoodalFs (1964) initial documentation of such behaviors, and field and laboratory studies of chimpanzee tool-making and tool-using abili ties have grown dramatically over the past few decades. After such concerted research and the development of a fairly extensive literature in each of these areas, it would seem an appropri ate time and stage in the discipline to undertake a comparison of tool-related behaviors evident among early hominin tool makers and that now documented among our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos. Why Compare Oldowan and Chimpanzee Tool Makers? The makers and users of Oldowan tools are now extinct, with no modern representatives of their mental and physical abilities and behav iors. The very earliest Oldowan sites emerge, in fact, prior to definitive evidence of any significant increase in brain size in early ho minins and are contemporary with a small brained, bipedal hominin form, Australopithecus garhi (Asfaw et al. 1999), whose cranial capacity (~450 cc) is within the range of modern apes. Thus, we are devoid of modern representa tives of the ancient species of tool makers, but we do have relatives, other living ape species, that show considerable tool-making and tool using abilities, namely members of the genus Pan (the chimpanzees and the bonobos). It can be safely argued that chimpanzees exhibit the most elaborate set of tool-related behaviors of any existing nonhuman species. Because the chimpanzee's cranial capacity is roughly equiv alent to that of a potential candidate for the earliest tool maker, and in consideration of the chimpanzee's documented propensity to make and use tools, it can be extremely useful to ex amine the similarities and differences between chimpanzee and early hominin tool-related behaviors. Such comparisons can help inform the fields of paleoanthropology and primatology as well as anthropology as a whole. These may help provide models for other possible tool behav iors of early hominins, which may be archaeo logically invisible in the material record; they may highlight behavioral adaptations among early hominins that go beyond behavior pat terns observed among other apes and which may have had significance in our species' evo lutionary success; they can likewise highlight aspects of modern primate behavior that show parallels with the behavioral transformations in the evolutionary lineage that led to Homo sapi ens, or conversely, provide insight into impor tant differences in the evolutionary trajectory of apes; and overall they may help provide a more refined view of how well, and in what ways, modern apes might serve as models for early hominin tool makers. THE OLDOWAN: AN OVERVIEW The earliest known assemblages of definite stone tools, consisting of stone artifacts that have been deliberately flaked through percus sive blows, appear in the archaeological record at 2.6 Mya at Oldowan localities at Gona in Ethiopia (Figure 1) (Semaw 2006), and numer ous sites bearing such tools have been found over the ensuing 1.5 My, first in Africa, then also in Europe and Asia. For other discus sions of the Oldowan, see Isaac (1981, 1982, 1984, 1989), Harris (1983), Toth (1985), Toth &amp; Schick (1986, 2005, 2006), Schick (1986, 1987), Potts (1991), Harris &amp; Capaldo (1993), Schick &amp; Toth (1993, 1994, 2001, 2006, 2009), Klein (1999), Martinez et al.

Here we outline the hominin candidates for early tool makers, summarize the nature of Oldowan sites and their stone tool industries, and discuss possible behavioral and cognitive implications of these industries. Who Were the Tool Makers? The Fossil Hominins From the current evidence, the earliest stone tool-making hominins of the Oldowan were likely australopithecine-grade with smallish brains and large dentition. The discovery of A. garhi at approximately the same time as the Gona sites in Ethiopia and only 60 km to the south would suggest this species as a candidate for the maker of the very early tool industries at 2.6 Mya. This taxon is also roughly contem poraneous with A. aethiopicus in East Africa and A. africanus in South Africa. Starting ~2.3 Mya, hominin remains have been assigned to the genus Homo, although good evidence for the beginning of the cranial expansion generally associated with this genus has not been documented until ~2 Mya. Dur ing the time span from 2.0 Mya to 1.0 Mya, the hominin taxa that have been identified that co existed with stone tool assemblages include the robust australopithecines A. boisei in East Africa and A. robustus in South Africa and early mem bers of the genus Homo: H. rudolfensis, H. habilis, and H. erectus. It cannot be ruled out that more than one of these hominin forms could have had some in volvement in stone tool manufacture and use, but it is apparent that members of the genus Homo (a) demonstrate a significant brain ex pansion during this period, between 2.0 and 1.0 Mya, likely correlated with a tool-making emphasis in their evolution; (b) also apparently carry this tool-making tradition out of Africa into Eurasia (Bar-Yosef &amp; Goren-Inbar 1993, de Lumley et al. 2005, Diez-Martin 2006); and (c) continue this tradition beyond the time of the extinction of the robust australopithecines by 1 Mya. Thus, the Homo lineage would rep resent the major progenitors of Oldowan tools and, subsequendy, the Acheulean tools (hand axes, cleavers, picks) that also appear on the pa leolandscape starting ?1.6-1.7 Mya (about the time of the emergence of H. erectus) and is con temporaneous with these simpler industries. The Nature of Oldowan Sites and Stone Industries Stone artifacts constitute nearly the entirety of the record of early hominin tool making and tool using because these are nearly impervious to the many destructive forces at work since these sites were occupied. If early hominins also had a tool repertoire involving organic mate rials such as wood, hide, or other materials, direct evidence of these is, for the most part, invisible in the archaeological record. A small number of polished and striated bones that may have served as digging tools have been reported, however, and may give valuable hints about some of the missing elements of the Oldowan hominins' tool kits (Brain 1981, 2007; d'Errico et al. 2001; d'Errico &amp; Backwell 2003). Fundamentally, early Oldowan stone arti facts are primarily products of hand-held per cussive flaking, i.e., holding a stone hammer in one hand and hitting another stone cobble or chunk held in the other hand with a strong percussive blow to detach flakes (a procedure called knapping). Another technique seen in the Oldowan is bipolar technique, in which a core is placed on an anvil and struck from the top with a hammer. Although this is ostensibly a rela tively simple activity, experiments have shown this is not such an easy task to master, particu larly with regard to the placement, angle, and power of the percussive blow (discussed further below). Early Oldowan archaeological sites consist, at a minimum, of quantities of stone artifacts and often also contain fossil animal bones, mosdy from medium-to-large-size animals. A number of these bones bear evidence of cut marks made with stone tools as well as evidence Acheulean (Industrial Complex): the next stage of human technology, characterized by hand axes, cleavers, and picks, as well as Oldowan-like forms (-1.7-0.2 5 Mya) www.annualreviews.org Tool Making of Early Homo and Pan 201</page><page sequence="4">Plio-Pleistocene: time period straddling the late Pliocene (-3.0-1.8 Mya) and Early Pleistocene (-1.8-0.8 Mya) of deliberate percussive pitting and fracture (e.g., Blumenschine &amp; Peters 1998, Bunn 1983, Pickering &amp; Dommguez-Rodrigo 2006), pre sumably to access marrow. A lively debate has centered on whether such butchery traces rep resent earlier, more primary access to animal remains through hunting and/or confronta tional scavenging (Bunn 1983, Bunn &amp; Kroll 1986, Dommguez-Rodrigo 2009, Dommguez Rodrigo et al. 2007, Pickering et al. 2007, Pickering &amp; Dommguez-Rodrigo 2006) or whether hominins had later, secondary access to carcasses by scavenging the remains of car nivore kills (e.g., Blumenschine 1986, 1989). Concentrations of hundreds or sometimes thousands of stone artifacts are typically found at many Oldowan sites, and sometimes these sites are clustered in major basins occupied by hominins and that were accumulating layers of sediment during the Plio-Pleistocene. Many of these sites are located in the Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, in karstic caves in South Africa, and in sedimentary basins in North Africa. Ma jor localities include Gona (Semaw 2000, 2006; Semaw et al. 1997, 2003), Hadar (Kimbel et al. 1996), Middle Awash (de Heinzelin et al. 1999), Melka-Kunture (Chavaillon et al. 1979), Konso Gardula (Asfaw et al. 1992), Omo (Howell et al. 1987), and Fejej (Asfaw et al. 1991, de Lumley &amp; Beyene 2004) in Ethiopia; East Turkana (Isaac &amp; Isaac 1997), West Turkana (Delagnes &amp; Roche 2005, Roche 2005, Roche et al. 1999), and Kanjera (Plummer et al. 2009) in Kenya; Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (Blumenschine &amp; Peters 1998; Leakey 1971, 1994; Peters &amp; Blumenschine 1995, 1996; Potts 1988); Nyam busosi in Uganda (Texier 1995); Sterkfontein and Swartkrans in South Africa (Field 1999; Kuman 1998,2005); Ain Hanech and El Kherba in Algeria in North Africa (Sahnouni 1998, 2006; Sahnouni et al. 1997,2002); and Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia (de Lumley et al. 2005). A typical Oldowan stone tool assemblage generally includes percussors (hammerstones, spheroids), simple core forms (choppers, discoids, polyhedrons, heavy-duty scrapers), retouched elements (scrapers, awls), and debitage (flakes and fragments). After ~2 My, some sites exhibited higher proportions of artifact classes such as retouched forms and battered spheroids, which Mary Leakey called "Developed Oldowan" (Leakey 1971, pp. 1-8). Oldowan artifacts, particularly the larger pieces or cores (so-called core tools), have of ten been categorized by various researchers ac cording to their shapes and placed into in ferred functional groupings such as choppers or scrapers. Experimental studies, however, have called into question whether such categories represent intentional end-products on the part of the hominin tool makers and also question the functional inferences often implied (Toth 1982,1985). These experiments in manufactur ing Oldowan artifact forms have demonstrated that the full range of typical core forms found at early sites can result as by-products of per cussive flaking to produce a set of sharp flakes, although sharp-edged core forms could also be used for a range of chopping and scraping activities. Raw materials used for stone artifacts tended to be found in the form of rounded cobbles from river gravels or angular chunks from pri mary rock outcrops. Depending on a given re gion, typical rock types included volcanic lavas (basalts, trachytes, rhyolites, phonolite, occa sionally obsidians, etc.), ignimbrites ("welded tuffs"), quartzes, quartzites, limestones, and cherts. A recurrent pattern at many Oldowan sites is evidence for transport of stone resources, including quantities of flaked materials, from place to place on the paleolandscape, as well as selectivity in choices of rock types and qual ity for tools (see Blumenschine et al. 2008; Braun et al. 2008, 2009a,b; Goldman-Neuman &amp; Hovers 2009; Harmand 2009; Hay 1976; Negash et al. 2006; Piperno et al. 2009; Schick 1987; Stout et al. 2005; Toth 1982). At some sites, these transport distances were more than ten kilometers. At Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, for instance, raw materials are quite often found several kilometers and sometimes 8-20 km from their sources, and at Kanjera, Kenya trans port distances were up to 13 km. 2Q2 Toth Schick</page><page sequence="5">Longer distance transport does not, of course, necessarily imply that hominins accom plished this in one event because raw materials may well have been moved on separate occa sions from one site to another, and such move ment of stone was likely embedded in their for aging patterns rather than special long-distance trips just for stone. From analysis of recon structed cores and from technological analysis of the artifact assemblages, it is evident that ho minins were often flaking cores prior to trans porting them to a particular site, conducting further flaking at the site, and then subsequently transporting some of the artifacts away from the site. This indicates a level of behavioral complexity that has only recently begun to be appreciated. One of the long-standing challenges of Palaeolithic archaeology is the determination of artifact function. For the Oldowan, most of the evidence is indirect?based on ethnographic analogy, experimental feasibility studies, and ar chaeological context (e.g., the association of stone artifacts with animal bones). We know that battered hammers and spheroids served as percussors for flaking stone, and roughly pit ted stone hammers and anvils testify to their use in bipolar flaking. And, as previously men tioned, the processing of animal carcasses can leave diagnostic cut-mark traces from the stone knives used to skin, deflesh, and dismember, as well as produce diagnostic fracture patterns from breaking bones for marrow and brains. This evidence is particularly clear at the FLK Zinj site in Bed I at Olduvai (the "Woodstock" of Oldowan studies), but it should be noted that a number of Oldowan sites with associ ated stone artifacts and animal bones bear little or no evidence of hominin modification (e.g., Dominguez-Rodrigo 2009) and leave the prob able function of these artifacts an open question. Experiments in the use of a range of Oldowan artifact forms for a variety of possi ble tasks substantiate the effectiveness of sim ple flake edges in cutting tasks, particularly in animal butchery (Jones 1994; Toth 1982, 1985). Microscopic usewear analysis on a sam ple of Oldowan artifacts from East Turkana has indicated use of a number of flakes for cutting meat as well as use of some others for cutting soft plants (perhaps grasses for bedding) and for scraping wood (Keeley &amp; Toth 1981). This lat ter evidence may suggest the use of stone tools to produce tools in other materials, e.g., per haps the shaping of wood into spears or digging sticks, but such direct evidence is so far absent in the Oldowan. The Oldowan documents one of the major phases of hominin brain evolution, with cranial capacities increasing from ~450 cc in A. garhi to up to 900 cc in early Homo erectus. Holloway et al. (2004) suggests that this period of brain evolution is correlated with increased language abilities, social complexity, tool standardiza tion, hunting, and the development of home bases. Recendy, brain-imaging studies (Stout et al. 2009) have shown that brain activity during the manufacture of Oldowan (and Acheulean) tools partially overlaps with areas associated with language, suggesting a possible coevolution of these two systems.

Summary: Implications of Oldowan Sites Some important inferences that bear on pos sible cognitive abilities of the early hominin tool makers can be drawn from the Oldowan patterns: 1. Stone tool manufacturing skill: Even very early stone artifacts at the earliest sites at Gona demonstrate remarkable skill and control in flaking stone; www.annualrevieivs.org* Tool Making of Early Homo and Van. 25*3</page><page sequence="6">Material culture: learned behavior that is manifested in objects, notably tools 2. Forethought and transport: Hominin tool makers showed considerable fore thought in multiple aspects of their tool manufacture and use, including transport of raw materials and tools to and from different site locales; 3. Selectivity in use of raw materials: Ho minin tool makers were aware of and re sponsive to signs of raw material quality that would affect ease and control of frac ture as well as tool effectiveness; 4. Concentrating artifacts: Hominin behav iors tended to concentrate substantial amounts of tool materials at certain lo cations, possibly indicating repeated use or large social group use of these locales; 5. Acquisition of animal resources: Evi dence indicates that hominins were of ten engaged in accessing meat resources from fairly sizeable animals using stone tools to deflesh carcasses and to fracture bones to access marrow. They may also have been actively involved in transport ing these animal parts and concentrat ing them at some site locations, presum ably for amenities such as shade, shelter, or protection or water. Consistent acqui sition of such food sources would have placed them in more direct competition with active predators and scavengers and likely increased their risk factors from predation as well. CHIMPANZEE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY Studies of Wild Chimpanzee Tools The range and instances of documented wild chimpanzee technology have increased dra matically during the past few decades of re search. This increase likely is largely the result of the growing number of habituated chim panzee populations combined with the number of long-term, committed projects investigat ing chimpanzee populations in different parts of Africa. The number of articles and chapters discussing chimpanzee technology and cultural traits far exceeds the citation limit of this review, so here we focus on the references that attempt a synthesis of our state of knowledge. A num ber of researchers from different backgrounds and perspectives have addressed the relevance of chimpanzee technology to human evolu tionary studies, including Beck (1980) (animal tools), Bonner (1980) (animal culture), Goodall (1986) (general), Foley (1987) (tool phylogeny), Wynn &amp; McGrew (1989) (primate and ho minin tool use), Sept (1992,1998) (nesting pat terns), McGrew (1992, 1993, 2004) (general), Berthelet &amp; Chavaillon (1993) (primate and ho minin tool use), Wrangham (1996) (general), Whiten et al. (1999, 2009) (chimpanzee cul tural traits), Stanford (2001) (general), Panger et al. (2002) (evolutionary history of technol ogy), Matsuzawa (2002) (general), van Schaik et al. (2003) (ape cultural traits), Hunt (2006) (sex differences in tool use), Lycett et al. (2007) (cladistics of chimpanzee cultural traits), and Carvalho et al. (2008) (chaines operatoires). Studies of chimpanzee tool use afford us much more fully textured insight into the range of material culture employed by these popula tions than is possible for Oldowan tools (e.g., Goodall 1986; McGrew 1992, 1993). McGrew (1993) has argued effectively for an intelligent, flexible, problem-solving use of tools among chimpanzees and, moreover, that tool use is the norm among wild chimpanzee populations. The range of tools used may differ among pop ulations, but tool use is observed daily in any well-habituated population. Chimpanzee tool use involves a variety of organic materials that do not tend to be preserved in the archaeologi cal record, and furthermore, it is possible to ob serve directly a wealth of detail regarding many aspects of tool use. The variety of details that can be obtained from studies of chimpanzee tool use among wild populations can include preparation or process ing of the tool, specifics regarding how it was used and on what sort of material(s), potential reuse of a tool, the use of tool sets combining a sequence of tools for a specific purpose, the frequency of observed uses of a tool, possible age or sex differences in tool use, the process of 294 Toth Schick</page><page sequence="7">learning tool use, fine-grained information re garding transport of tools and other materials, seasonal or ecological factors affecting tool use, contemporary regional or population similari ties and differences, possible details regarding the locale of tool use (shade or protection, food or other resources, etc.), and potentially other activities also conducted at the site. These data can provide a wealth of information not direcdy available to the Palaeolithic archaeologist. McGrew (1992, 2004) has provided broad overviews of material culture as well as cul ture writ large among chimpanzee populations, particularly among wild chimpanzees. As he has noted, most observations of habitual chim panzee tool use are oriented toward subsis tence activities, obtaining or processing mate rials for consumption, especially social insects such as termites or ants and nuts. Typical tool use for subsistence would include fish ing for termites with twigs or grasses, using leaf sponges to scoop brains from a cranium or fruit from a husk, or using stone or wood hammers and anvils to crack open hard-shelled nuts. One report (Mercader et al. 2007) has sug gested that a locality in the rainforest of Cote d'lvoire dated to 4300 years ago may be a chim panzee nut-cracking site, which would indicate some longevity for this practice if chimpanzees were responsible for the apparent activities here. In addition, in Senegal, chimpanzees ap pear to have used stone anvils to smash open baobab fruits (Marchant &amp; McGrew 2005). Another category of tools consists of mate rials used as weapons, such as sticks and stones thrown at other chimpanzees or at baboons competing for the same food, behaviors that are well known but not systematically studied. Al though chimpanzee males are known to prey on smaller animals such as monkeys and small antelope, they generally have been observed to carry out the hunt and the consumption of the animal without the use of tools. An exception to this pattern with regard to hunting has re cently been documented in Senegal by Pruetz &amp; Bertolani (2007), who observed a number of chimpanzees, particularly females and includ ing immature individuals, on several occasions shape wooden branches into pointed tools to try to jab and extract prosimians from tree cavities; they observed one successful kill in 22 bouts of observations. Besides such use of stone hammers and anvils, another chimpanzee activity that could have archaeological visibility is their consump tion of prey animals, which can leave tooth marks on bones, including tooth scoring, canine punctures, and damage to bone ends. This prac tice has been observed in the wild (Plummer &amp; Stanford 2000) as well as in an experimental set ting (Pickering &amp; Wallis 1997). [Toothmarks on bones from Oldowan sites are often assumed to be produced by carnivores, although there is a growing appreciation that Oldowan ho minins could also be responsible for some of these (White &amp; Toth 2007)]. Some sex differences have been noted among chimpanzees in terms of tool-related be haviors. Notably, fishing for termites and dip ping for ants are important subsistence activi ties conducted with tools that are preferentially associated with females, who have been ob served to pursue these activities much more of ten than do males. McGrew (1992) has observed that these activities require prolonged and sys tematic persistence using a tool to extract pre dictable resources and that they are, in a sense, akin to gathering. Hunt (2006) has observed that not only do female chimpanzees use tools more frequently than do males, but they do so especially for lower-return food items requir ing significant processing. Hunt further notes that females also use tools during arboreal feed ing, whereas males use technology to harvest terrestrial resources. Among the nut-cracking chimpanzee populations in West Africa, inves tigators have observed that females are more apt and efficient than are males in opening the harder-shelled varieties. As mentioned above, hunting of smaller mammals is a predominantly male activity, albeit without the use of tools. A number of researchers have compiled evidence and analyses from a number of chimpanzee study areas and discerned that chimpanzee material culture and nonmate rial culture show some regional patterning, www.annualreviews.org Tool Making of Early Homo and Pan 25)5</page><page sequence="8">indicating the potential role of cultural trans mission in spreading and maintaining regional patterns of behavior (Whiten et al. 1999, 2001). Such a pattern might be expected because many shared behaviors among chimpanzees appear to be learned, often transmitted through observation and a trial-and-error learning curve. Much of this transmission seems to be from mother to offspring, sometimes with a prolonged period of apprenticeship (Boesch &amp; Boesch-Achermann 2000, Goodall 1986, McGrew 2004). To investigate large-scale chimpanzee cul tural patterning, Toth &amp; Schick (2007) exam ined the relationships between geographical proximity of different chimpanzee populations in West and East Africa and the number of shared cultural traits reported in the Whiten et al. (1999) study. At the species level, there was no significant pattern, but at the subspecies level (comparing West African groups to other West African groups of Pan troglodytes verus and comparing East African groups to other East African groups of Pan troglodytes schwein furthii), a highly significant pattern appeared to emerge (Figure 2). The number of shared cul tural traits between groups dropped by more than half (from eight shared traits to fewer than four) at a distance of ^700 km (about 450 miles). ? 10 (0 I 0 I.I 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Distance between study areas (km) Figure 2 The relation between the number of shared chimpanzee cultural traits (habitual or customary, from the Whiten et al. 1999 paper) and distances between pairs of chimpanzee groups of the same subspecies. Note that groups in closer proximity tend to share more traits and that the number of shared traits drops by more than half (to fewer than four) at a distance of ~700 km. A Pearson r2 value of 0.702 was derived for the 11 pairs of 7 groups; among the East African chimpanzee groups (10 pairs), Pearson r ? -0.829, r2 = 0.687, p = 0.003; Mantel test p = 0.014. 296 Toth Schick At the species level, with West African and East African populations separated by more than 4000 kilometers (more than 2700 miles), and perhaps two million years of time based on some genetic estimates, the results would appear to indicate some degree of conver gence (independent invention) of cultural traits among disparate populations, without any clear evolutionary history. At the subspecies level, with a much more recent evolutionary history, there appeared to be some geographic pattern ing to the number of shared cultural traits by proximity to other chimpanzee groups. The drop-off of more than half the number of cul tural traits in ~700 kilometers was used as a model for early hominin groups on the basis of known Oldowan archaeological sites (Toth &amp; Schick 2007, Whiten et al. 2009). Such a sub species patterning has also been independently suggested by Lycett et al. (2007) on the basis of a cladistic/phylogenetic analysis of chimpanzee cultural traits. Thus, there is no universal chimpanzee cul ture in terms of tools but rather different clus ters of tool-use behaviors in differing popula tions. One major difference noted between East African and West African populations is the prevalent (though not universal) use of ham mers and anvils of stone or wood to crack open hard-shelled nuts in West African chimpanzee populations, a behavior that has not yet been documented among East African populations. Whiten et al. (2001) found that 39 behavior patterns, many of which involved tool use, vari ably observed among a group of 9 long-term chimpanzee study sites across Africa, showed patterning consistent with social transmission. As might be expected, as quadrupedal, knuckle-walking animals, chimpanzees are not proficient at transporting materials. They do transport tools to tool-use sites, though gener ally over fairly short distances. Interesting pat terns are observed in the tool transport be haviors for nutting activities in West Africa (Boesch &amp; Boesch 1983, 1984, 1990; Boesch &amp; Boesch-Achermann 2000; Boesch-Achermann &amp; Boesch 1994). For the softer-shelled Coula nuts, wooden hammers are sometimes chosen</page><page sequence="9">and taken up into a Coula tree to crack open nuts on a tree branch. For the harder, Panda nuts, however, stone hammers are sometimes carried short distances to the base of the Panda tree. The distance a stone or wooden hammer is transported may be relatively low in a single instance, but cumulative trips could accomplish greater distances. Boesch &amp; Boesch (1984) documented trans port of wooden or stone hammers primarily over distances of less than 20 meters but with many transports evident over a distance of up to 500 m and, in very rare instances, more than 500 m. Their study indicated the chim panzees could develop mental maps of resource locations and follow a least-distance rule in choosing stones to transport to nut tree loca tions, likely in response to the difficulty chim panzees face in transporting heavier materials over longer distances. Chimpanzees also gen erally do not transport vegetable foods or in vertebrates any great distance away from the food source. After a hunt, males may transport the kill (e.g., in the mouth or around the neck) to a safe or comfortable place for consumption, but with some difficulty in any case. Under such constraints, it is not surprising that, as McGrew has observed (1992), containers are not part of the tool equipment employed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees in the wild have not been observed to flake stone deliberately and thus do not produce materials that may be di rectly compared with Oldowan technology. Al though Mercader et al. (2002) suggested that a West African nut-cracking locality presum ably used by chimpanzees contained materi als comparable to artifacts at early Oldowan sites, this material does not appear to represent the products of deliberate percussive flaking (unlike most Oldowan artifacts) but instead is only the by-product of nut-cracking (Schick &amp; Toth 2006, pp. 24-26). Interestingly, no food getting or other activity conducted by mod ern chimpanzees appears to require a reliance on cutting activities, and this may be the pri mary reason that a culture of flaked stone tech nology has apparendy not developed among chimpanzees. To explore the ability of this closely related ape to manufacture Oldowan-type artifacts, then by knapping, we conducted an experimen tal study. An Experimental Study of Bonobo Stone Tool Manufacture One major obstacle in attempts to compare and contrast Oldowan technology with the material culture of chimpanzees is that modern apes in the wild are not known to flake stones inten tionally in the wild. Beginning in 1990, we em barked on a long-term experimental project to teach bonobos (Pan paniscus) to make and use flaked stone tools (Figure 3, see color insert). In collaboration with cognitive psychologists Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Duane Rumbaugh and their colleagues at the Language Research Laboratory of Atlanta and then the Great Ape Trust of Iowa, we began to investigate the tool making and tool-using capabilities of bonobos in an experimental setting. Pioneering work by Wright (1972) with a young orangutan demonstrated that a great ape could be taught to make and use a stone tool. Although this experiment used a flint core strapped to a stable board and did not continue beyond the first flake produced and used, it was nonetheless one of the inspirations behind this project. We produced a more naturalistic en vironment for the bonobos, where freehand, hard-hammer percussion was used to flake cob bles of quartzite, lava, and chert, and the sharp flakes produced were then used to cut a cord to open a box (or cut through the membrane of a drum) and retrieve a food reward. Our first bonobo subject, Kanzi, learned both the flaking and the cutting tasks through observing a hu man tool maker, began using flakes the first day of the experiment, and made his first tool within a month of the onset of the experiment. He has now been flaking stone for 18 years, and his sister Panbanisha is now also a practiced stone tool maker (Savage-Rumbaugh &amp; Fields 2006; Schick et al. 1999; Toth &amp; Schick 1993, 2006). Recently we undertook a three-way compar ison of stone tools manufactured (a) by very www.annualreviews.org Tool Making of Early Homo and Pan 2577</page><page sequence="10">early tool makers at Gona, Ethiopia (possibly A. garhi); (b) by bonobo (Pan paniscus) tool mak ers with several years experience in stone tool making; and (c) by modern H. sapiens very ex perienced in Oldowan tool manufacture (Toth et al. 2006), all using the same raw materials. These three populations of stone artifacts were then analyzed in detail and compared in terms of dozens of assemblage characteristics, partic ularly those that would indicate a level of tool making skill. For most of the traits attributed to skill, the bonobos tended to be the outgroup, with char acteristics of the Gona artifacts either clustering with the modern human sample or intermediate between the bonobo and human samples. The bonobo cores tended to be heavier (the bono bos tended to select larger cobbles, probably because their hands were larger), less heavily reduced, and with fewer scars and a great deal of hammerstone battering on core edges from unsuccessful blows. The morphology of the bonobo cores and flakes appears to have been a function of less impact velocity (a probable biomechanical constraint) as well as less control as to where exactly to detach flakes from a cobble core (a possible cognitive constraint). The Gona artifacts, however, show much better skill in cobble reduction than the bonobo artifacts do. Cores are more heavily reduced, with almost twice the number of flake scars, and exhibit significantly less battering from misplaced hammerstone blows. Biomechanical studies (Dapena et al. 2006, Harlacker 2009) of the arm swing during Oldowan flaking indicate that manufacture by modern humans produces a very rapid speed of the hammerstone, reach ing a final velocity of up to 2 0 mph. The bonobo arm swing during tool making is considerably less, which may help account for the lower skill evident in their flaking and the considerable battering on the bonobo cores relative to the Gona artifacts and those produced by modern humans. This study has demonstrated that our clos est living relatives among the apes are defi nitely capable of stone tool manufacture. The apes in this study, however, are not as proficient in stone tool making, even after many years of experience, as were the early hominin tool makers. As noted above, this difference in skill may be attributed both to cognitive process ing and to the biomechanical constraints of the ape. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In view of the significant technological reper toire of chimpanzees, there are valid arguments for using their behaviors as models for aspects of early hominin activities that are elusive or largely invisible to us. There are, however, also significant differences in chimpanzee biology, behavior patterns, and ecology that should tem per us from basing our models of hominid be havior on modern chimpanzees too strictly or uniformly. This overview has highlighted a number of elements of chimpanzee technology and behav ior that appear to have, or may be likely to have, some counterpart in early hominin be havior and technology. These would include the concentrating of tools at sites of use, consump tion of meat involving hunting activities and even group cooperation, carrying and transport of tools including stone, battering and bash ing activities with stone, their use of probing sticks (which may have some counterpart in early bone tools), and even their tendency to gather together in groups on a daily basis (in nesting trees at night). We could also infer that the cultural trans mission of tool use within a group and between groups would have parallels between the chim panzee mode (especially from mother to off spring) and early Oldowan hominins. We do not know if the sexual differences observed in chimpanzee tool use and behaviors had coun terparts in early hominins, but the ape model does raise this question. Hunt (2006) suggests, based on chimpanzee analogies, that female Oldowan hominins were more frequent tool users than males. The use by chimpanzees of a great variety of tools in perishable, organic materials highlights the probability that early 208 Toth Schick</page><page sequence="11">Figure 1_ The dawn of human technology.

C-2 Toth Schick</page><page sequence="13">hominins likewise had a much richer, more diverse, and varied tool kit than is visible in the archaeological record. Bipedal hominins would have had a considerable advantage in terms of transporting tools and foodstuffs around the landscape, and this practice could have been gready enhanced with the use of containers. The emergence of the Oldowan around 2.6 Mya, at our present state of knowledge, appears to occur during an evolutionary stage involving relatively small-brained, bipedal aus tralopithecines. The following one million years documents a period of dramatic encephal ization with the rise and evolution of the genus Homo, a reduction in the size of hominin jaws and teeth, the first spread of hominins out of Africa and into Eurasia, and the earliest appear ance of Acheulean industries. Wild chimpanzees and Oldowan hominins, considering their material culture, would ap pear to share the following characteristics. First, stone is transported to and used at activity ar eas, making spatial concentrations of material culture. Second, stone tools become modified (battered and pitted) from their use as hammers and anvils. As previously mentioned, it is likely that Oldowan hominins had a rich suite of cul tural traits that leave little prehistoric visibility. Similarly, the majority of chimpanzee cultural traits and tool-related behaviors would leave lit tle long-term archaeological record. Although their tool use is intelligent and flexible, chim panzees tend to modify their tools with their bodies, e.g., stripping branches or pulling off bark with their hands or feet or even sharpen ing tips of branches with their teeth. Early ho minins may well have accomplished some tasks in a similar fashion, but the human paleonto logical evidence suggests that a decrease in size of jaws and teeth over time may be correlated with the rise in extrasomatic tool use, with tech nology creating "synthetic organs" and gradu ally allowing hominins to move into niches tra ditionally occupied by other animals, such as the carnivore guild. We have called this phe nomenon "techno-organic" evolution (Schick &amp; Toth 1993). Major differences in material culture be tween wild chimpanzees and Oldowan ho minins would include the following traits ob served in the Oldowan: 1. Skilled, forceful stone knapping by direct percussion with stone hammers, or bipo lar flaking with stone hammers and anvils to create sharp edges that could be used for cutting, chopping, and scraping. 2. More selectivity and long-distance trans port of lithic raw materials from their ge ological sources to activity areas ("sites"); concentrations of flaked and battered stone artifacts can number into the hun dreds or thousands at a given locality, and transport distances can range from tens of meters to more than 10 kilometers. 3. The acquisition, processing, and con sumption of large mammal carcasses (or parts of carcasses), assisted with tech nology (stone knives and percussors) to exploit meat, marrow, and organ foods, leaving recognizable traces on the bones in the form of stone tool cut marks and hammerstone-induced fracture. 4. Longer-term curational behavior of ma terial culture over longer distances and probably longer time periods, suggesting a higher level of planning and anticipa tory behavior. It is likely, but less demonstrable, that dur ing this period hominid populations developed more human-like characteristics, including the emergence of containers and carrying devices (e.g., of skin, shell, or bark); digging tools such as sharpened digging sticks to process under ground plant resources; simple spears, throw ing sticks or stone missiles, and clubs for pre dation; larger average group sizes and home ranges; food-sharing behavior; more sexual di vision of labor; more emphasis on central forag ing places (home bases); more complex commu nicative skills; and the beginnings of symbolic behavior. Future research into Oldowan archaeology will almost certainly continue to stress the role of technology in its ecological context and www.annualreviews.org Tool Making of Early Homo and Pan iqq</page><page sequence="14">explore new ways to study and test the signif icance and patterning of this technology dur ing the course of human evolution. As new sites are discovered, our sample sizes of well excavated stone artifact assemblages, associated animal bones and other materials, and associ ated hominin tool makers will allow more rig orous methodologies and more robust scientific results. Studies of our ape relatives in the wild will become increasingly crucial and urgent as their habitats dwindle and their populations be come endangered, and our disciplines will also gain a great deal of understanding from well constructed studies of captive apes, who may become the surviving guardians of their genetic and behavioral legacy. Chimpanzees and bono bos are our closest living relatives. Each of our lineages has managed to survive for millions of years since we separated from a last com mon ancestor; we still have much to learn about them, and they still have much to teach us about ourselves.
