London, Christophers, 1937. 15s. A cornerstone in the foundations of our knowl- edge of pre-Roman Italy, the Iguvine tables have received much attention in recent years. Von Blumenthal (Die iguvinischen Tafeln, 1931), Devoto (Gli antichi Italici, 1931; Tabulae Iguvinae, 1937), Goidanich (Historia viii, 1934, pp. 237 ff., 579 ff.) and Whatmough (The Foundations of Roman Italy, 1937, pp. 196 ff.) have made valu- able contributions to the study of this fascinating but perplexing document. Emanating from the pen of noted philologians these studies were pri- marily based on a philological interpretation of the text. Rosenzweig attacks the subject from a different angle. Her purpose is to examine the Iguvine tables from the point of view of a his- torian of religion. As implied in the title she fur- ther narrows her subject down to the study of the religious life of one community and does not at- tempt to expand her investigation to a general study of pre-Roman religion in Italy, or even in Umbria. That a number of problems of religious character are clearly stated is a valuable conse- quence of this self-imposed limitation. The author also deserves praise for her attempt to settle the topographical problems on the site. Goidanich, who has also investigated the site, be- lieves he has found traces of two ancient gates. His Umbrian Iguvium differs from that of Rosen- zweig in size and in the location assigned to the three gates. As a readable account and a consci- entious commentary Rosenzweig's book has value for students who want an introduction to the re- ligious problems of the Iguvine tables. Unlike some of her predecessors Rosenzweig prefers to err on the side of timidity rather than temerity. For her interpretation she draws mainly on the Classical sources, wisely leaving the purely philological questions to the expert care of Pro- fessor R. G. Kent. Having thus eliminated the dangerous ground of archaeology and comparative religion she escapes the Scylla of uncritical hypotheses but is driven dangerously close to the Charybdis of eclecticism. Too many of the problems involved can only be advanced toward solution through co-ordination of philology, com- parative religion, and archaeology. As Devoto says "in questa direzione sta l'unica possibilita di progresso" for the study of Italic religion. Let us briefly review some of the problems which are raised in Rosenzweig's book. First the date of the Iguvine tables. The writer correctly states that the older tables were inscribed in the fourth or the third centuries B.C., but seems to have rather extravagant notions about the period in which their contents were formulated. It is ex- tremely unlikely that "the Etruscan system of town-planning was found at Iguvium long before the domination of the Etruscans." Etruscan cities go back to the seventh century B.C. What we know archaeologically of Umbria discourages any idea of organized settlements of town character before the late sixth century at the very earliest. From this and other indications it would hardly seem possible to date the contents of the tables earlier than the late sixth century, which, of course, does not preclude the possibility that some of the rites and beliefs alluded to in the tables are of much earlier character. Interesting is the view of the writer that the lustral procession moved counter-clockwise while purifying the arx.1 This direction toward the left is unusual (Eitrem, Opferritus der Griechen und Ri6mer, pp. 9 ff.), but seems to have been also followed in foundation rites (Servius V, 756). Archaeological evidence seems to bear out Rosenzweig's conclusion (Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus, Strong, Roman Sculpture, pl. 5; further material in Lehmann-Hartleben, Die Trajanssdule, 1926, pp. 24 ff.). The matter cannot, however, be regarded as settled until a complete collection of material is made. Thus on the im- portant early pediment from the Via San Gre- gorio, Rome -which is now re-assembled in the Antiquario Communale-the procession would seem to move toward the left, but the animals are clearly led to the right. (Stuart Jones, Pal. Con- servatori, pls. 11l f. The fragment, which shows the legs of animals, is unpublished.) It is note- worthy that in other sacrifices, for instance, in the sacrifice to the Lares, the processions are shown moving to the right. Finally, a few remarks on the deities of the Iguvine tables. The curious flexibility of this pantheon, in which deities are distinguished by adjectives, which in their turn emerge as inde- This problem was pointed out to the reviewer by Professor A. D.

These deities oscillate curiously be- tween a rather pronounced personal anthropo- morphic aspect and the more abstract vagueness of natural powers and functional forces. Irre- sistibly the question presents itself: how far were these deities thought of in anthropomorphic terms? For the early epochs we cannot reach any results except by deduction. The final stage of anthropomorphism, however, the stage that cre- ates cult images and mythology, leaves tangible results and allows us to recognize the situation in Italy at the time when the Iguvine tables were in- scribed. In view of the many other similarities between Rome and Iguvium their difference in this respect deserves emphasis. In Western Italy the late seventh and the sixth centuries are the period when an anthropomorphic pantheon is definitely formed; Rome, Latium, Etruria, and Campania then form a cultural unity. Interesting evidence is afforded by the figurative terracotta revetments of temples. The border-line of the re- gion in which remains of archaic temples were found, runs from Pompeii to Bologna, with Spoleto an outpost in the East. Rome is an im- portant center of temple building; it can boast, in fact, one of the earliest temples of Central Italy (ca. 600 B.c., Van Buren, Terracotta Revetments, p. 51, pl. 21, 1). That these temples of the sixth century contained images need hardly be proved, but if proof is wanted the heads from Celle, from Satricum, the colossal head in the Metropolitan Museum, and statues represented on vases and panels afford sufficient evidence (Giglioli, Arte etrusca, pls. 78, 5; 199; 108, 1. Richter, Met. Mus. Papers vi, p. 16, pls. 15 ff. Ducati, Pontische Vasen, pp. 14 f., pl. 13; cf. Gordon, Cults of Lanuvium, 1938). On the crest of the same wave, Etruscanized Greek deities, Minerva, Herakles, Apollo, Dionysos achieve popularity. Their Etruscan representations are first found in this period. Family relations and mythology were bound to be introduced once the anthropomorphic view had advanced so much along the Greek lines. Rome shared this religious transformation of the sixth century. But east of the Appennines and in the moun- tains of Central Italy the process was much de- layed. To the reviewer's knowledge no traces of archaic temples or images have been found in Umbria. Characteristically, also, such popular deities of Etruria and Latium as Juno, Minerva, Herakles, and Apollo are entirely absent from the Iguvine tables. The reviewer is convinced that the tables represent a transitional stage in the religious history of Umbria at a time when it was under- going influence from Etruria as a natural result of the proximity of such centers of late Etruscan civilization as Cortona and Perugia. Anthropo- morphic elements began to gain ground, and such Etruscan features as triads and temples were adopted. The shrine of a minor god, Coredius, is apparently mentioned in the tables. But after all the Iguvine tables are in the main a reflection of the religious feeling of a simple agricultural community for whom the personified gods of images and temples are less important than the primitive forces that hover over their towns and fields. It is not to Roman or Etruscan art, but to the drastic rusticity of the situlae of Certosa and Sesto Calendo (MacIver, Iron Age, pl. 14; Giglioli, pl. 82) that we should go if we want to visualize the simple dignity of the Iguvine Fratres Atiedii.
