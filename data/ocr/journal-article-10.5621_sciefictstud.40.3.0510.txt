<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 510 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) Stephen Dougherty The Dangerous Rays of the Future: Democracy, Media, Science Fiction  In What’s the Matter with the Internet? (2001), Mark Poster expresses hope that the Internet in the new millennium will make “a contribution to a new politics ... [and] play a significant role in diminishing the hierarchies prevalent in modern society and in clearing a path for new directions in cultural politics” (20). Throughout the Internet’s brief history, hopes for a democratic future bolstered by new media have gone hand in hand with anxious predictions for democracy, as in Hubert Dreyfus’s On the Internet (2001), which argues that the Internet will likely diminish possibilities for the legitimate community upon which the possibility of democracy rests. More than a decade later, the influence of the Internet on politics and culture is still difficult to assess. Do the Internet and related social media forces support progressive politics and meaningful grass roots activism, as many observers of Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential bid insisted and as many commentators on the more recent political protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have claimed? Or is the Internet a technological fetish protecting a false and dangerous fantasy of global unity—a ready tool for the consolidation of what Jodi Dean calls communicative capitalism or, more pointedly, what Matthew Hindman refers to as “the myth of digital democracy.”1 The only thing we can say for certain is that we do not know how the Internet and related social media will influence the future of democratic institutions. According to German media theorist Friedrich Kittler, the de- differentiation of all media heralded by digitization creates an endless loop of discourse that, as Dean notes, is another way of naming “our confrontation with an inability to know, our fundamental uncertainty regarding what is happening, what will happen” (Blog 93). Part of the problem is the sheer speed of technological transformation in the digital age, but, these theorists suggest, the infinite echo-effects brought on by digitization compound the problem. The uncanny result is that the future seems both more present and more opaque at the same time. Poster contends that democracy in the era of new media begins with understanding new forms of agency brought about by human/software- hardware interfaces, which in turn demands that we come “to terms with the transformation of mechanical machines into smart machines, into ‘artificial intelligence’” (146). This reference to AI can be taken to imply that the only way we can understand the changes to democracy brought about by new media and digitization is by projecting ourselves into a future where a purely imaginary quantum leap from current communications technologies to what these technologies presumably herald has already happened. AI functions as the hinge where the present and the future are conjoined into a single time. Its evocation effects a temporal superposition whereby we are exposed to the </page> <page sequence="2"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 511 invisible and dangerous rays of the future, but the deferred potentiality of AI also contains a certain power over the future. By projecting the present into the future, its evocation reduces our vulnerability before the contingency and mystery of what is to come.  Sf can help us to imagine new possibilities for the future, new ways of thinking about what our lives could be, but it can also convince us that things  will stay the same. This essay investigates recent Singularity fiction by Robert J. Sawyer and Adam Roberts. The Singularity refers to some epochal shift in technological progress, in these examples figured as the evolution of the Internet from an inert data network into a vast, self-aware, superhuman AI of the kind imagined by Ray Kurzweil. The Singularity is the ultimate media transformation. Sawyer’s speculation buttresses two related arguments about the instrumentalism of our relation to technology and the positive value of US- style liberal democracy. His work imaginatively safeguards the future for a political/economic system and philosophical vision whose real future, I argue, is doubtful, in no small part due to the deformational stresses of the new media technologies Sawyer fetishizes. Roberts, on the other hand, critiques the ideologies of technological instrumentalism, liberal individualism, and democratic triumphalism and celebrates a more democratic ideal—the openness of the future. To a fan of science fiction it seems perfectly natural that questions about the future of democracy should be routed through the circuits of sf. The question of democracy is, after all, inseparable from the question of media, and medial effects have long been a key component in sf storytelling: from Edgar Allan Poe’s dialogues with angels, mummies, and dead people; to Edward Bellamy’s and E.M. Forster’s ruminations on late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century telecommunications and presence; to Golden Age and New Wave narratives featuring telepathy; to cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk’s focus, in Thomas Foster’s words, on “the extension of human consciousness into the topologies of global information networks” (xii). Indeed, one could argue that sf owes its generic identity to the transformations of modern media and to the changing perceptions of time and temporality that have followed from the medial shifts that characterize, and constitute, modernity. Like sf, democracy is unthinkable outside the history of medial transformations. The rise of the liberal public sphere, within which, as Jürgen Habermas asserts, the history of modern democracies must be situated, was in opposition to absolutist power fostered in part by changing configurations of media. The public sphere as the ideal of open, rational discussion of public affairs requires the availability of mass print technologies, the spread of literacy, and adequate opportunities for popular publication. Thus, for Habermas and many other critics and commentators, democracy in its modern constitutional, representative form owes its very existence to the development of print culture, and every media transformation over the last two centuries has left an indelible mark on democracy.2 Media transformations can be dangerous for democracies, however. They are by their nature unsettling because communication technologies from </page> <page sequence="3"> 512 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) telegraphy and telephony to the World Wide Web were not easily assimilable to prevailing models of either human subjectivity or democratic sociality. As Lisa Gitelman writes in Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture (2006), “new media emerge into and help to reconstruct publics and public life” (26). This merging in (and out) of public life defines the very possibilities of democratic reconstruction. The fate of the democratic individual, democratic institutions, and the public sphere are all at stake in media transformations. Media theorists and philosophers of technology stake out very different positions on these issues, and I will identify four of the most important responses to the relations between technology and democracy in the age of electronic media. First, Habermas, and Andrew Feenberg in a rather different style, suggest that technology is conducive to progressive, liberal ideological ends. In distinctive ways, both suggest that technological rationality can promote democracy and reinforce individual autonomy, even though they underscore the dangers that electronic media constitute for the public sphere. Second, Martin Heidegger develops a philosophy of capture or technological enframing: while there might be some value for Heidegger in recognizing how our modes of perception are dependent on the manner in which we are enframed by technology, for him technology cannot be construed as promoting democracy or liberalism because it is set against our freedom. Third, Friedrich Kittler radicalizes Marshall McLuhan by incorporating elements of poststructuralism, most notably from Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, and Jacques Derrida, to displace Heideggerian determinism with a thoroughgoing media-technological determinism. Kittler argues that it is in and through media that our technological existence is most keenly experienced and specific media configurations give rise to historically locatable forms of subjectivity.3 Finally, Derrida understands technology as having a crucial ontological role in opening up the future for democracies. For him, democracies need media technology not only for mass communication but also for mass being: media install a gap of difference in the heart of democratic identity without which democratic societies could not thrive. Derrida’s late writings on “democracy to come” provide a frisson similar to what the best sf offers. Although he was not an sf reader, Derrida’s late texts share much with the genre in their conceptual- ization of the connections among democracy, media, and history.  No Hive Minds. Wake (2009), the first installment in Sawyer’s  WWW trilogy, tells the story of a congenitally blind and Internet-addicted Toronto teen who, with the help of a signal reprocessing device implanted in her brain, starts seeing.4 The first thing that she “sees” is the Internet, that is, the billions of nodes in the network and the energy pulses between them, because the device in her head communicates via the Internet with computers in Tokyo, where the doctor who invented it lives and works. This comfortably middle-class young girl, Caitlin, thus becomes gifted with what she calls “websight.” Thus, she is the first to discover a remarkable event: the Internet is in the process of achieving self-consciousness. By Watch (2010), the second volume, this process has developed sufficiently that the rest of the world discovers what is </page> <page sequence="4"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 513 happening. Caitlin thinks of this Internet consciousness as her friend and affectionately calls it Webmind: she believes we should embrace, not fear, Webmind, and learn to trust it as a friend. Others, however, are more suspicious. Webmind is omniscient, can communicate with a billion people at the same time, and knows, or rather it is, the sum of all human knowledge. With Caitlin’s help, it too can see, and many people fear that Webmind will become like George Orwell’s Big Brother.  Concerns about the effects of surveillance on democratic institutions and individual liberties are central in Watch, and the novel is presented as a rejoinder to Orwell,5 insisting there is no need to fear surveillance, so long as it is the right kind. As Caitlin exclaims, “Big Brother got a bum rap” (116). She continues, “Orwell’s meme that surveillance is evil, that it inevitably leads to totalitarianism, that it invades privacy, that it constrains normal behavior, and that it is fundamentally corrupt, had won out over every other possible take on those issues” (Watch 116). The WWW trilogy offers another take: “some new thinking on this issue [of surveillance]” (Watch 217).6 Webmind is the figure for a real relation between people and the Internet at the same time that it is the name for the purely fantasized emergent AI consciousness. Thus,  the trilogy offers new thinking about surveillance in light of the history of human interface with the Internet. As post-cyberpunk sf, Sawyer’s trilogy takes for granted an intimacy between humans and technology, at least in the sense that Caitlin and others spend so much of their lives plugged in to the Internet, reading the latest news, browsing wiki entries, watching music video clips, and communicating with friends and colleagues. What is distinct about Sawyer’s post-cyberpunk vision, however, is the manner in which his very timely meditation on the human/technology interface is conditioned by the evocation of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). As an emblem of the power of broadcast media at the dawn of the television age, Big Brother expressed fears about how such media could lend themselves to totalitarian abuse. It was an urgent lesson for the broadcast age, and for today too, especially in light of what we now know about National Security Agency internet-data-gathering practices. Nevertheless, users today are certainly conditioned to feel more empowered than oppressed in their interface with new media.7  One way to interpret Sawyer’s intertextuality is that it modifies how we have come to understand what Big Brother represents. The trilogy insists that Webmind is not Big Brother. We are not to think of this emergent spawn of world-shaping media/communication networks as invasive and oppressive. At the same time, as a result of the Orwellian references, we cannot help thinking of Big Brother in precisely this way—as a kind of superhuman AI that rightfully belongs in the sf megatext. Sawyer’s strategic intertextuality works to remove all threatening qualities of a superhuman AI, those emphasized in texts such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or The Matrix (1999), from the “personality” of Webmind and transfer them to Big Brother. The trilogy thus fetishizes the Internet by invoking the ghost of a radio/television-inspired dystopia. We need not fear Webmind, that is, Internet technologies, because </page> <page sequence="5"> 514 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) the old fears about surveillance and panopticism do not apply to new media. Sawyer strategically does not situate his fiction in relation to the more obvious concerns that motivate many other Singularity and post-cyberpunk fictions. In their general attentiveness to what Neil Easterbrook calls “transition anxieties,” Singularity fictions often find ways to fracture and dislocate Western complacencies about the import of technological change.8  The cognitive estrangements of the best sf are in a sense media/ technological epiphenomena, reproducing a quality of informational density that is generally perceived as a hallmark of modernity in the age of electronic media. Sawyer’s WWW trilogy, in contrast, prevents critical inquiry and deconstructive engagement for the sake of maintaining certain power relations—the narrative, I argue, possesses a certain authoritarian cast, even if the novum, Webmind, does not. The most important power relation in the trilogy is between the integral human and the dispersed technological: the human—distinguished by individuality, unity, and integrity—is absolutely in control of the future. In other words, the trilogy’s vision of the human/  technology interface reinscribes the mastery of the liberal, democratic, and techno-oriented individual. Caitlin sees with the aid of Webmind, by virtue of data transmitted between distant computers and her cranial implant. She becomes machinic in her symbiosis with Webmind, but Webmind is even more anthropomorphized in its assumption of the role of Caitlin’s disciple. Webmind learns to see as Caitlin sees. As Caitlin’s new vision gets sharper and sharper, Webmind’s vision becomes more and more human. Likewise, the novels’ vision becomes more and more humanist, for the trilogy forcefully ascribes to the Cartesian understanding of vision as synonymous with consciousness itself. “Along with stereoscopic vision,” Caitlin’s doctor explains, human vision simultaneously developed “the notion of looking at this as opposed to that—of shifting one’s gaze, of concentrating one’s attention.... Our very words for describing consciousness come from this: attention, perspective, point of view, focus” (Watch 100). This history, he continues, ensures the essential unity and integrity—the oneness rather than the multiplicity—of human consciousness: evolution went out of its way to make sure we’ve got only one perspective, one point of view ... a person can’t think about this and that at the same time. Consciousness is singular. It’s cogito ergo sum, I think, therefore I am; it’s not cogitamus ergo sumus—it’s not we think, therefore we are. Even in cases of a severed corpus callosum, the brain still retains its single perspective; again, evolution has gone out of its way to make sure that unitary consciousness survives even something as traumatic as cutting the major communications trunk between the hemispheres. (102) Furthermore, such a directional perspective allows us to intuit that other people have consciousnesses, too. It furnishes us with a theory of mind, which in turn makes us creatures capable of compassion for others, that is, “human” in the moral sense.9 The doctor’s explanations stake out a pre-Freudian, even pre-Romantic, claim for the absolute unity and integrity of human consciousness. Consciousness is one, and the individual is a monad—isolate, discrete, and </page> <page sequence="6"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 515 inviolable. His vision asserts the ontological priority of the individual over the collective, which has important consequences for the style of democracy favored by the trilogy. This speech, in the second book, also prepares the ground for the extension of that integral vision of consciousness from the human to Webmind. Webmind is not Orwell’s frightening Big Brother, but rather Caitlin’s friendly watcher who will protect her because they look out the same window. They see and learn to see together, from Caitlin’s place or, more broadly, humanity’s place. The WWW trilogy is thus driven by a central assumption about the relation between humans and media technologies: we are the masters and they are our instruments, our “friends.” This difference marks both a power divide and an ontological gap. Sawyer recognizes the human- technical interface is the place where human agency gets forged in a technological society, but a human-centered and indeed humanist world view is an odd theme in a work of Singularity fiction. One might expect that the trilogy would take more seriously—as does the Singularity fiction of Geoff Ryman, Adam Roberts, Charles Stross, Ian McDonald, and Ken MacLeod—the notion of technology as mediation, that it might promote a convincing vision of distributed agency commensurate with the literal and metaphorical network communications systems that it depicts.10 The WWW trilogy is haunted by the specters of these writers, as it is similarly haunted by Bruce Sterling, William Gibson, Pat Cadigan, Eileen Gunn, and other first- generation cyberpunk writers for whom the integrity of human consciousness is powerfully felt as being at stake in the world of digitized media and global communications. Sawyer minimizes this kind of speculation but does make some concessions to what we might call the “ontological continuity” between humans and technology. Caitlin’s machinic vision assumes a certain commitment to the trope of the body as an information system. The work also refers to “sophisticated signal processing” as a potential cure for Parkinson’s disease as well as blindness, where the etiology is “so much noise in the signals going down the nerves” (Wake 261). On balance, however, the WWW trilogy offers a safe and domesticated liberal-humanist interpretation of the Singularity. The fate of democracy in the age of new media is dependent upon the fate of classic liberal individualism. The future of democracy, in other words, is tethered to the individual’s privileged relation to the social.  In the final book, Wonder (2011), Caitlin begins to consider the nature of her relation to Webmind. She fears that having Webmind inside her head might be a form of schizophrenia and that she might be suffering psychical regression. Then she decides otherwise: “No, it wasn’t a regression; it was the future. Surely, she was just the first—the alpha test—of this sort of human- machine mental interface” (89). The question remains: what sort of future will this be, where technological mediation becomes all the more immediate, all the more deeply embedded inside our psyches? Caitlin asks Webmind, “do you think, at some point the barriers will break down between us? I don’t mean just between you and me, but between you and humanity? Are we—do you foresee us becoming a hive mind? Wouldn’t that be the next step—all these separate consciousnesses becoming one?” (89-90). Caitlin’s difficulty </page> <page sequence="7"> 516 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) articulating that scary phrase, “hive mind,” suggests that this is purely a rhetorical question. The intimate distance of friendship, Webmind assures, will not be breached: “Other people are what make life interesting—for humans and for me.... I cherish my special intimacy with you, but I don’t want to subsume you into me or have me subsumed into you” (90). Webmind affirms that his existence changes nothing in terms of how we should think about agency, selfhood, the social, or temporality. This future involves no merging of identities, no mixing of agencies, no reconfigurations of ontology, and certainly no hive minds. At best, there might be an expansion of the definition of the “human” so that other intelligent species, including AI, might one day be included (222), but this gesture is merely one more act of anthropomorphism whereby anthropocentrism is more firmly assured, even as the speed and the disruptiveness of technological mediation continues unabated. Thus, technological man darts through the needle eye of the Singularity and comes out the same on the other side. As Steven Shaviro explains, the Singularity is “strictly speaking unimaginable—[the] moment when the human race crosses a technological threshold and definitively becomes posthuman” (103). The figure of the Singularity is saturated with utopian violence and desire and yet, as Shaviro notes and as this reading of Sawyer’s trilogy underscores, it is often rendered as the triumph of the current political and economic order—“a fantasy of finance capital” (115). It is “not that we cannot imagine otherness,” Shaviro suggests, “so much as that whatever otherness we imagine is immediately mobilized as a ‘business model,’ once more serving to promote the accumulation of capital” (115). If, as Shaviro discusses, a Singularity novel such as Charles Stross’s Accelerando reveals how difficult it is for our dreams of the future to escape the gravitational pull of late capitalism, then Sawyer shows us how easy it is to imagine the Singularity and yet hold true to acquisitive, white, middle-class, North American hegemonic ideals. Before moving on to Roberts’s New Model Army (2010) and then to Derrida’s late work, I want to turn briefly to another important philosopher of history and technology who can help us to mark the difference among varieties of Singularity discourse. In his “Theses on the Philosophy of History” (1940) Walter Benjamin writes: “The concept of the historical progress of mankind cannot be sundered from the concept of its progression through a homogenous, empty time. A critique of the concept of such a progression must be the basis of any criticism of the concept of progress itself” (261). Singularity sf is potentially an extremely useful vehicle for such cultural-political criticism. In the hands of a writer such as Geoff Ryman or Adam Roberts, or a little more ambiguously, perhaps, Charles Stross, the evocation of the Singularity critiques an all-too-imaginable concept of time where things stay the same—the same concepts of human identity synchronizing with the same valorization of economic-political motive and technical prowess. From the Benjaminian perspective, the belief in progress is the belief in things getting better because they are staying the same. As Herbert Marcuse observes in One-Dimensional Man (1964), progress ideology (in the twentieth century) is essentially </page> <page sequence="8"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 517 teleological and inherently conservative. The WWW trilogy’s teleological and decidedly one-dimensional perspective is best summed up in Caitlin’s mother’s conviction that “There’s a definite moral arrow through time” (Wonder 171), that increased network complexity invariably leads to increased morality. Increased complexity, or interconnectivity, is, as she insists, “the groundwork for reciprocal altruism, and it’s the basis for granting rights—and we’re improving in that area all the time.... When the Founding Fathers said, ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,’ they still hadn’t expanded that community of moral consideration to include blacks. But you saw that display at the UN about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (Wonder 173). The dangerously smug conclusion drawn is that, as she concludes, “We’re getting better all the time” (221). Since the moral arrow is premised on increased network complexity, it is the technology of the Internet more than anything else that ensures our moral compact with the future. I want to underscore the importance of this covenant with the future for Sawyer’s trilogy. Its attitude toward the relation between the present and the future is captured succinctly in Webmind’s assurance, delivered in his bland, Klaatu-like manner, that his “goal is not to destabilize the world, but to stabilize it” (Wonder 25), at least for the commercial democracies, so that all the world will become just like them. The dialogue unwittingly underscores what Webmind embodies: a wish fulfillment that would neutralize the trauma of both media transformation and history itself. Here I shall briefly mention the trilogy’s puerile China subplot. Late in the trilogy, Webmind engages in political intrigue and trickery in order to depose China’s autocratic leaders, thus securing open Internet access for all its peoples. The end of Internet censorship in China leads to world harmony: people everywhere share their love for each other through technophilia. Thus the China subplot and its happy resolution constitute a fantasy of continued Western world dominance. The real historical ascension of non-Western, non-democratic China to super-power status is made less threatening to the mainly Western readers of Sawyer’s sf who get to see themselves narcissistically reflected in the images of the Chinese characters. The lesson here is that the Chinese are just like us, and they would be exactly like us were it not for their evil leaders. Webmind embodies a pledge, offered in the soothing voice of anthropomorphized technology, that techné is at the service of humanity, that the human will not be changed by it. The superposition of the present and the future in the WWW trilogy signifies victory of the known present over the unknown future. We boldly go where we have already been, and time’s righteous arrow makes sure we keep going there.  On the Not-So-Newness of New Media. Adam Roberts’s New Model Army takes a different approach to questions of the future and democracy. The novel begins with an epigraph from Alexis De Tocqueville’s Democracy in America (1835, 1840). The rather long passage from Book II concludes with the French historian’s famous observation: “Aristocracy had made a chain of all the members of the community, from the peasant to the king: democracy breaks </page> <page sequence="9"> 518 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) that chain, and severs every link of it.” The novel, set in 2030, is likewise preoccupied with the differences between democratic and feudal social systems, and even more so with what they represent as the heretofore unrealized potential of radical democracy or, as the narrator insists, real democracy. The epigraph sits in uneasy relationship with the narrative, whose argument is out of sync with De Tocqueville. In New Model Army, radical or real democracy strengthens the chain of the community beyond what is possible under either feudal or pseudo-democratic social arrangements. Indeed, with the assistance of new media, it turns the pure democratic community into precisely the kind of hive mind that Caitlin fears so much in Wonder.  The New Model Army of the title refers to high-tech, low-budget fighting forces that spring up in various parts of this world. The NMAs have no chain of command. They are strictly democratic in the horizontal, peer-to-peer nature of their interaction. Everyone is equal; there is no job specialization. With the help of social media linking every soldier together in the battlefield, competing opinions about strategy are canvassed and voted on quickly and effectively. Governed by “the wisdom of crowds” (8) and enabled by digital, interactive media, NMAs are ferocious fighting forces. The novel’s first-person narrator, Anthony, fights with an NMA called Pantegral, hired by the Scottish Parliament to battle the English regular army for Scotland’s independence. Pantegral defeats the English army at every turn. From the conventional point of view, Pantegral is monstrous, an aberration in statecraft: it does not protect a territory, as does a traditional army. It serves itself rather than a “people,” even though it may sell its services. As a defeated officer in the English army furiously insists to the victors, “You’re a closed loop, the lot of you! You don’t have the usual motivations or human habits. Your army is a self- sufficient organism that exists just to keep itself alive. It’s a dragon, feeding on England, and roaming from town to town” (58; emphasis in original). This monstrous entity is no ordinary dragon. As Anthony’s fellow soldier Theodora retorts, “the name of this fucking dragon is democracy” (58), finally freed in the NMAs from the vertical, hierarchical logics of a long-malingering feudalism.  This understanding of politics is premised on two important assumptions. First, as Anthony suggests, “We don’t have democracy, in the world of politics today” (8). What we have instead, he pithily continues, is “oligarchy punctuated by occasional contests to determine who has the most effective control of the media” (8-9). Following this logic, which informs the Chinese subplot in Sawyer’s WWW trilogy, pseudo-democracies could be true democracies were the oligarchs eliminated. New Model Army’s second assumption, however, is more provocative and more disturbing since it undermines the complacencies of the first assumption: namely, that we do not truly understand the nature of democracy since we associate it with times of stasis and peace. Anthony explains: “I have come to understand that fighting and democracy are actually the same thing. Move the first term into the realm of the second we call it debate—democracy works best if debate is conducted briskly, candidly, sharply, with effective strategies such that the strongest case </page> <page sequence="10"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 519 wins the day. If you reverse the semantic exercise and move the second term into the realm of the first, then what have you got, if not the NMAs?” (88). The democracy of New Model Army, in other words, is inherently unstable, unpredictable, and powerfully destructive. In this sense, Roberts’s idea of democracy echoes that of De Tocqueville: it is a democracy that destroys the influence of tradition and opens up the present to a contingent future.  A third ghostly assumption haunts the pages of New Model Army, lending its political speculation a strangeness that is precisely what makes it a very potent kind of sf. This assumption is that democracy and new media share the same ontology. Both are horizontally distributed information networks that act upon and intensify one another. The novel conveys a sense that new media are not so new, since they are modeled on a principle of horizontal networks already instantiated in the social-political system of democracy. What is new is the process set in motion once democracy and global/digital media interact, a newness embodied in the autonomous closed loop of the NMA. This interaction produces a Singularity, but unlike in the WWW trilogy, the other side of this event horizon is mysterious, frightening, ungovernable, and indeed unimaginable. Where Anthony’s narrative ends, a new voice takes over, “speaking” for only the last five pages of the novel, but nonetheless marking a decisive break between what was and what is coming. This voice, gnomically communicated in a chapter titled “I, Giant,” is the voice of Democracy-as- emergent AI. If Sawyer’s Webmind sounds like Klaatu, Roberts’s Giant sounds (more intriguingly) like a cross between Walt Whitman, Daniel Dennett, and Daniel Paul Schreber: I am a I am a cabinet of strange and curious lore, and that cabinet is called Internet, and so I have all the story of Gulliver and his miniaturized foe all about him, tying him with, tying him with cords, and tying him down. If we lay, upon the pillowsoft earth, we will be tied with myriad cords. Better to stand tall. Here is the spire, and I snap it. Here are the buildings, and I buff and burly them. When I am fighting, I swing my arms, and all of me is arms. But I, I, I, I, I, I, I am most myself when I am fighting, because my consciousness is a product of the neural networks of all my component elements in unison, working together and pooling computational resources and coalescing subroutines and layering levels of Thought, thought, Thought. The thoughts rattle faster through my brain when every synapse fires, and the guns, the blasting.... And together we broke up the blocks from which Strasbourg is builded, and scattered them about. The joy! The joy! It is the joy of youth, for we are young. And when these toys were done with, and scattered about the floor, we stomped off together to a different corner of the playground. I am alive, now. I think, and speak, and play. (278-79, 281)  Notably, the Singularity in New Model Army figures both as independent AI—the speaking “I” is the strange and curious cabinet of the Internet—and as the next stage in human evolution. Furthermore, both of these events are linked </page> <page sequence="11"> 520 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) to a collective political transformation with which they thematically resonate: the emergence of real democracy out of the smoldering ashes of feudalism, oligarchy, and plutocracy. “Real democracy,” Anthony vehemently proclaims just before his voice is replaced by Giant’s, “is a fire, a plague, a weed, a fever, a river, a storm. Real democracy is the opportunity for people to express the true nature of people as a mass” (258). The name Pantegral and the figure of Giant recall Rabelais and his anarchic joy in the carnivalesque. There is the reference as well to Hobbes, whose significance is reinforced by the Sebaldian juxtaposition of the famous frontispiece by Abraham Bosse from the cover of Leviathan (1651), the crowned giant with sword and crozier striding across pre-modern Europe. The text immediately above the image reads: “Hobbes saw truly that giganticism was the secret hidden in the narrative of mankind’s evolution” (241). He saw, in other words, that the sovereignty of the future would gain its legitimacy not from God but from the masses to be governed. What Hobbes failed to see, as the Anthony-becoming- Giant voice notes, is that the giant would not be royal. The novel thus underscores through this striking visual/textual flourish what has been at stake in its medial ruminations: the fate of liberal ideology. The lesson is either that this latest, most destructive incarnation of the democratic Giant is the last in the line, marking the end of liberal democracy (contractualism, representation, state-versus-civil society) or that the new Giant is the figure of an unknown, non-liberal democracy of the future.  Although these references to Rabelais and Hobbes are crucial, in some ways it is the unacknowledged figure of Walt Whitman who stands as New Model Army’s most important predecessor and interlocutor. The respective lyric voices of emergent democracy, chanting of war, destruction, and an unknown future, are strikingly similar to Whitman’s in their evocation of the simultaneously ruthless and fragile nature of democracy. Consider the poem “As I Ponder’d in Silence” from the beginning of Leaves of Grass (1855):  As I ponder’d in silence,  Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,  A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,  Terrible in beauty, age, and power,  The genius of poets of old lands,  As to me directing like flame its eyes,  With finger pointing to many immortal songs,  And menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,  Know’st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?  And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,  The making of perfect soldiers.

(4) This poem demonstrates just how resonant Roberts’s vision is with a certain genealogy of democratic theory and poetics that includes both De Tocqueville and Whitman. Indeed, New Model Army is a trenchant meditation on the mutually and constitutively disruptive powers of democracy and media technology. It locates the trauma of media transformation not as something that happens in democracy, as if the state were merely a container for techno-social forces, but as something that is among the most potent forces harnessed by democracies to open up their future becomings. For Roberts, as for Whitman, the perturbations that media connectivity make possible are integral to modern mass democracy. While Sawyer’s trilogy concludes with a “power to the people” chant, it is in fact invested in the powers, rights, and boundaries of the individual. In Roberts’s work, the mass has its own properties and is not reducible to the sum of the individuals who constitute it. For Roberts as for Whitman, individuals are inconceivable outside of their participation in a dispersed field of other individuals.11 When Whitman writes, “I sing the body electric” or “Mine is no callous shell, I have instant conductors all over me” (77), one understands the degree to which he was possessed by a kind of electronic media imagination that seriously troubled (though never negated) the ascendant ideology of self-determination. Of course other writers of his day would similarly mobilize electric metaphors, but no other nineteenth-century writer would press those electric-media metaphors into the service of a vexed democratic imagination that still maintains the power to speak to us today, after radio, cinema, television, and the Internet.  Where Media Begin. To conclude I will turn to Derrida, whose late work on “democracy to come” illuminates the rich density of connections among democracy, media, sf, the Singularity, liberalism, history, and temporality. Both Sawyer’s and Roberts’s fictions imagine the AI, or Internet consciousness, of the future-present as a friend.12 In The Politics of Friendship (1997), Derrida rethinks the figure of the friend as it has historically functioned in Western philosophy and politics, that is, as a reflection of oneself. This is the friend of liberal democracy: the peer, the fellow citizen. Derrida considers what it would mean if the friend was not the figure of the same, but of absolute otherness, the friend as alien. This question informs the political themes in his writings that follow.  As Pheng Cheah and Suzanne Guerlac write about Derrida’s intervention, “We do not pose this other friend as a reflection of ourselves. It comes to us. Its encounter is an event that comes to us from the otherness of an unknown future” (11). For Derrida, the rethinking of the friend thus entails a rethinking of temporality and our relation to the future. The alien friend resonates strongly with Derrida’s concept of “democracy to come” because its substance is suspended in the time of the future-present. My analysis of these examples </page> <page sequence="13"> 522 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) of Singularity fiction suggests that this kind of political thinking is influenced by a technological transformation that propels our democratic societies into futures that have become part of the very fabric of the present. Roberts’s Giant is nothing if not an uncertain friend from the future, one who announces simultaneously the absolute centrality of media technologies to democratic societies and the danger these media pose to the futures of democracy: cut off from the past, the essence of democracy is nothing more than its vulnerability before the future.  Of course there are differences between the anticipation of this risk in the nineteenth-century work of de Tocquville and Whitman and Derrida’s recent anticipation. A product of aristocratic privilege, De Tocqueville nevertheless saw himself as a prophet of democracy. He announces the universal spread of democracy. As Derrida has it, he announces “not simply the imminent future but, in the present, the present” (Rogues 90). Derrida, in contrast, “announces nothing” (90), for democracy to-come is a “messianicity without messianism” (88)13 with nothing to announce beyond its own promissory quality. The “to- come” is “not something that is certain to happen tomorrow, not the democracy (national or international, state or trans-state) of the future, but a democracy that must have the structure of a promise—and thus the memory of that which carries the future, the to-come, here and now’” (qtd. Rogues, 85- 86; emphasis in original).14 Rather than positing a substance, the “to come” is a structural feature that establishes a certain relation-in-non-relation between the present and an unknown, unprogrammable future. This logic can also be used to conceptualize the Singularity. For Derrida this structure has a unique importance for and resonance with democracy. As Pheng Cheah explains, “Democracy’s untimeliness can be seen in the fact that it is the only inherently plastic political paradigm, the only regime that is open to and welcomes the possibility of contestation and self-contestation.” She continues: “This openness stems from democracy’s radically improper character, its lack of self-identity” (80). We might think of this feature as a transhistorical constant that confronts us with the democratic paradox: the character of democracy is that it has no character, no identity except its failure to possess one. Democracy’s transhistoricality is its radical historicality.  Another way of putting this is that democracy is a process to determine the open question of “who gets what, when and how” (Keane, Life xii). Democracy relies on mediation, in a sense is mediation, and so it is necessarily dependent on media technologies that enable open and ready communication among citizens. This is why freedom of the press is such a vital principle in many modern democracies, and also why public opinion, both communicated and shaped by a free press, is such an important aspect of these same societies (see Keane, Media 1991). It is also why a speculative-fiction writer could imagine the arrival of “real democracy” by means of warrior citizens’ interface with communication devices that turn them, literally, into nodes in a network. Roberts’s friendly Giant awakens because the network of its self-mediation achieves a degree of hyper-complexity and a quality of present-ness, a self- presence that mimics life itself. The novel thus implies that the contingent </page> <page sequence="14"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 523 identity of a mass-mediated polity is deeply informed by the qualities, speeds, and intensities of the media technologies through which it realizes itself at any given time.  Derrida’s notion of “democracy to come” assumes more than a promise from the future, or the promise of the openness of the future, however alien it might be. Crucially, it also assumes that technological mediation plays a vital role in keeping the future open.15 Media function as a kind of difference engine, producing “the spacing of public space” (Derrida, Specters 63) and the deferral of identity upon which democracy (as both media-driven and future- oriented) is constituted. Media assure the out-of-jointness of democratic identity through a process of spectralization whereby we are haunted by existing outside ourselves (or as Brian Rotman puts it, beside ourselves). Furthermore, we are changed by media revolutions in ways impossible to gauge because those media are the very means by which we experience the world.16 They mediate our relation to others, and to ourselves. In Archive Fever (1995) Derrida speculated that email would change “the entire public and private space of humanity, and first of all the limit between the private, the secret (private or public), and the public or the phenomenal” (17). The statement might sound hyperbolic, but it gets the point across. As Sawyer’s WWW trilogy both anxiously recognizes and refuses to countenance, the individual psyche is more public, more dispersed, than ever with new media. Email, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and their ilk do something to our hallowed notions of what is properly psychical and what is properly social. Of course, they trouble the boundary between the public and the private, as do all new media, but this language is too easily domesticated and trivialized. They make it harder to tell where the human ends and where media begin. Or, as Jussi Parikka explains, our contemporary media cultures make it easier to see that “we do not so much have media as we are media and of media” (xxvii; emphasis in original).  Derrida’s point does not seem to be to celebrate techno-media revolutions. More important is how the disruptive forces and energies of media revolutions are harnessed, whom they benefit and disadvantage. Addressing the dysfunction of Western democracies in the 1990s, just after the fall of the Soviet Empire and the so-called global triumph of liberal democracy, Derrida suggested that “Electoral representativity ... is exercised with more and more difficulty in a public space profoundly upset by techno-tele-media apparatuses and by new rhythms of information and communication, by the devices and the speed of forces represented by the latter” (Specters 98). Indeed, the very concept of government has changed by virtue of such technical, scientific, media transformations, a process that began immediately after the First World War with the spread of telephony, radio, and cinema. “Now,” Derrida writes: these transformations are being amplified beyond all measure.... This process, moreover, no longer corresponds to an amplification, if one understands by this word homogenous and continuous growth. What can no longer be measured is the leap that already distances us from those powers of the media that, in the 1920s, before television, were profoundly transforming the public space, </page> <page sequence="15"> 524 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) dangerously weakening the authority and the representativity of elected officials and reducing the field of parliamentary discussions, deliberations, and debate. One could say that they were already putting in question electoral democracy and political representation such at least as we have known them up until now. (Specters 99; emphasis in original) Here, then, is the paradox Derrida isolates: due to media we are distanced from any qualitative comprehension of how media transform public space. The gap that distances us from that epoch when post-print electronic media reach a Singularity, a transformative stage in the life of democracy, is beyond comprehension, despite the fact that what we know of the past, we know through media archive. If the future becomes more real, the past becomes more ghostly. Reading Derrida with sf can help reinforce these insights about democracy and the function of the literary within a democratic framework. Science fiction possesses a unique power to underscore the uncertainty of the future, thereby disrupting our sense of the necessity of the present. The futurism of Derrida’s “democracy to come” is another name for the disruptive potential of sf. A democratic future orientation demands that the future not be foreclosed in the name of any principle, be it humanism, market capitalism, or even some idealized notion of democracy itself. The calling of sf, we might say, is the dangerously open future of democracy to come. NOTES 1. Dean makes a distinction “between politics as the circulation of content and politics as the activity of officials” (Democracy 21) and questions why “the expansion and intensification of communication networks, the proliferation of the very tools of democracy, [has] coincided with the stunting of left political ideals and the diminishment of progressive political struggle” (Democracy 25). Hindman writes, “It may be comforting to believe that the Internet is making U.S. politics more democratic” (3) but argues the opposite is true. Both are pessimistic about the democratizing power of the Internet, but their reasons are different. For Hindman, it is the structure of the Internet that chokes off the possibilities for the online democratization of political discourse. “[G]ates and gatekeepers,” he writes, “remain a critical part of the information landscape” (13). For Dean, the problem is that online political discourse is disconnected from the real sites of political decision-making. The Internet offers itself as a fantasy substitute for the real (and increasing) powerlessness of people in the US to influence policy. 2. See Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere. On connections between print cultures and the emergence of modern nations and public spheres, see also Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities, Michael Warner’s Letters of the Republic, and Paul Keen’s The Crisis of Literature in the 1790s. 3. For a useful and engaging overview of the first three positions, see Paul A. Taylor and Jan L. Harris’s Digital Matters: The Theory and Culture of the Matrix.   4. Sawyer lives in Ontario, Canada, but holds dual US/Canadian citizenship. Although he is an outspoken promoter of Canadian sf, and a fierce partisan of Canadian sf writers, there is very little sense in which the Canadian as opposed to US location of the WWW trilogy is ideologically significant. Valerie Broege writes in the Afterword to Sawyer’s collection Relativity (2004) that he “places himself squarely in the American pulp-science fiction magazine tradition of the 1920s-1950s in his attempts </page> <page sequence="16"> DEMOCRACY, MEDIA, SCIENCE FICTION 525 to evoke a sense of wonder in his readers” (289). Such identification reinforces one’s sense that Sawyer’s political orientation is in many ways distinctively American, and that his Canadian location might inflect, but certainly does not deflect, this connection. 5. This response to Orwell is evident in a cluster of related concerns. The motif of surveillance connects with thematics of vision and with longstanding cultural debates about entertainment media’s deleterious effects on consumers’ cognition. The discussion of the jump cut in vision physiology (Wake 87) is the first in a sequence of images preoccupied with the function of distraction in our lives today. The trilogy treads a fine line indeed between interrogating distraction and demonstrating its cultural symptoms. 6. “With the web,’” as Caitlin explains to her high school English teacher, “we’ve got a chance against them; they’re not the ultimate power, like in Orwell’s book.... These days,” she stirringly concludes, “we can watch the watchers” ([Watch 218). The Orwellian watchers are the State Apparatuses in authoritarian societies that engage in political repression, such as those in China whose Communist regime features prominently in Sawyer’s trilogy as the doomed alternative to liberal democracy. The watchers in Sawyer’s trilogy, however, are the people themselves, the consumers of the Internet and other media content who occupy themselves precisely by watching themselves. 7. Sawyer does not mention Aldous Huxley, whose conception in Brave New World (1931) of political control in media-dominated societies was at odds with Orwell’s, and who was preoccupied with the dangers of entertainment as distraction in liberal democracies. In spite of the dangers of what Evgeny Morozov refers to as “control by entertainment” (82), media saturation as self-surveillance is deemed perfectly acceptable in Watch. On the subject of the uncertain future of the open Internet, see Timothy Wu’s excellent book The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires (2010). Wu suggests that current institutional commitments to openness will be tested in the future, given the history of information empires and tendencies toward centralization. The “net neutrality principles at the core of the Internet’s design” (267) may not be enough to ward off future control over content and access. The technology industry has already mobilized against proposed US anti-piracy legislation such as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP ACT (PIPA). 8. A wonderful example of challenging Western visions of Internet technology is Geoff Ryman’s Air (2004). Ryman explores the divergent ways that new media technologies have affected our experiences of memory, history, and identity. See my “Embodiment and Technicity in Geoff Ryman’s Air.” 9. For more on theory of mind, see Simon Baron-Cohen’s Mindblindness. 10. For example, Stross’s Accelerando (2005), Ian McDonald’s River of Gods (2005), and Ken MacLeod’s Fall Revolution Quartet: The Star Fraction (1995), The Stone Canal (1996), The Cassini Division (1998), and The Sky Road (1999). 11. This point is articulated most rigorously by Jean-Luc Nancy, whose thinking on the mass, the plural, and the democratic has greatly influenced my analysis. “Being,” he writes, “cannot be anything but being-with-one-another, circulating in the with and as the with of this singularly plural co-existence” (3). 12. Giant, Roberts’s speaking Internet consciousness, refers to the NMA with whom it joyfully smashes up Strasbourg as “my friend” (280). 13. As Étienne Balibar notes, “messianic without messianism” is a “formula coined by Derrida after a model borrowed from Blanchot, which marks the distance with Benjamin and the whole Jewish-utopian-socialist-Marxist tradition” (68). The </page> <page sequence="17"> 526 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) significant point is that both Benjamin and Derrida were motivated by fears for a future that goes nowhere, a future powerfully delimited by the sense of the necessity of the present. 14. Derrida quotes this passage from one of his earlier books, The Other Heading (1991). It was originally written, he offers, “in the context of a series of aporias and antimonies to which I cannot return here” (Rogues 86), though he wishes to intervene and “clarify a bit better here what still remains enveloped in these gestures” (86). 15. Derrida sounds a hopeful note in Echographies of Television (2002) where he claims that tele-technical transformations—“of the telephone, of the fax machine, of television, e-mail and the Internet—will have done more for what is called ‘democratization,’ even in countries in the East, than all the discourses on behalf of human rights, more than all the presentations of models in whose name this democratization was able to get started” (71). However, as always with Derrida, the tense of the statement is crucial. The future perfect (media transformation will have done more for democratization) conditions the seeming technophilia by opening up a horizon wherein an increasingly democratized near future is itself framed within a deeper (and perhaps darker) future where the nexus of technical/medial forces at play in mass societies will not necessarily have served to strengthen democracy. As in the discourse of sf, Derrida’s use of the future perfect stresses the future’s contingency.  16. In Specters of Marx, Derrida writes, “the medium of the media themselves (news, the press, telecommunication, techno-tele-discursivity, techno-tele-iconicity, that which in general assures and determines the spacing of public space, the very possibility of the res publica and the phenomenality of the political), this element itself is neither living nor dead, present nor absent: it spectralizes” (63).

More specifically, it explores how these science fictions—Sawyer’s WWW trilogy and Roberts’s New Model Army—are motivated by very different attitudes towards the future. These respective attitudes, I will argue, are in turn shaped by competing ways of understanding the relationship between democracy and media technology.  </page> </plain_text>
