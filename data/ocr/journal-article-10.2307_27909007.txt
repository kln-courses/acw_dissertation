<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CREATION OF MAN: PHILO AND THE HISTORY OF INTERPRETATION. By Thomas H. Tobin. Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series 14. Pp. viii + 199. Washington, DC: Catholic Biblical Association, 1983. Paper. $6.00. This monograph, a revised form of a 1980 Harvard dissertation, is a study of Philo's interpretation of the creation of man in Genesis 1-3, and specifically in 1:27 and 2:7. Tobin approaches this study with two particular questions: (1) what were the exegetical traditions available to Philo and what were Philo's own developments and contributions?; and (2) what was the philosophical milieu of the period in Alexandria and how did this influence both the traditions and their use by Philo? Very early in the book (p. 8), Tobin establishes the two basic criteria which he will use in determining which interpretations are Philo's own and which are those of his predecessors. Pre-Philonic interpretations are (1) those which Philo tells us directly are not his own; and (2) those which clash with a position which spans the entire Philonic corpus and thus can be identified as Philo's own. Rather than doing a comprehensive analysis of a single Philonic treatise, Tobin approaches the two questions which he poses through a synthetic study of all the</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 27(1986) 144 Reviews passages in Philo which deal with the creation of man (De Opifico Mundi, Legum Allegoriae 1, Quaestiones in Genesim 1 ). Although this approach works well for most of the book, it makes for a very complex and difficult second chapter (even with the help of diagrams and charts, e.g., p. 31) as he attempts to outline the development of the various interpretations of the creation of man and their interrelationship. While the material given might be necessary as an overview, one wonders if it could have been presented in a more readable manner; as is, the chapter needs to be read with the relevant texts (which are not quoted) immediately at hand. Once Tobin moves on to Chapter 3 and following to examine the specific types of interpretation one by one, the material becomes much more focused, readable, and fascinating. First, he shows that the anti-anthropomorphic interpretation is the earliest and the simplest, drawing on both Stoic and Platonic concepts to explain isolated phrases which are seen to be problematic. In the second pattern of inter pretation, Gen 1:27 and 2:7 are treated as complementary formulations of a single creation of earthly man. In Gen 1:27, the key for establishing the grounds of interpretation is a single crucial word in the text, the preposition kata understood as "according to the image of God," i.e., the Logos, the intermediate figure which was introduced into Middle Platonism in the late first century B.C. Similarly Gen 2:7 is interpreted by clarifying the meaning of a single phrase in Stoic categories, which are then subtly reinterpreted in terms of Philo's Platonic reference. In the third level of interpretation, which is still pre-Philonic, Gen 1:27 is interpreted as the creation of the "heavenly man" fashioned on the sixth day and belonging to the intelligible world; Gen 2:7 is the creation of the "earthly man" on the seventh day, belonging to the sensible world. Finally, we move to Philo's own interpretation, which is discussed not in light of Gen 1:27 and 2:7 but in terms of Gen 2:8, 15-17, the placing of man in the Garden of Eden. According to Philo, it is the earthly molded man of Gen 2:7 who is placed in the Garden, since he needs teaching and instruction. In a further move, the man of Gen 2:7 becomes a symbol for the human mind, and the man of Gen 1:27 becomes a symbol of virtue and wisdom so that the heavenly man, the Logos, and Wisdom are assimilated to each other. This shift from two "men" to two "minds" then allows Philo to incorporate his interpretation of the creation of man with his allegory of the fall, that distinctive approach which is basic to Philo's overall understanding of the Pentateuch. For someone like myself who is not a Philo expert but is interested in the history of biblical interpretation, this book is a most enlightening and even captivating study (at least once Chapter 2 is passed!). In addition to the treatment of biblical inter pretation per se, considerable information is given about Hellenistic philosophic developments, particularly in Middle Platonism, and a number of less readily accessible texts are conveniently quoted. For an assessment of Tobin's work in light of other recent Philonic scholarship, the reader might want to consult the review by Earle Hilgert in Catholic Biblical Quarterly 47 (1985), 175-76.
