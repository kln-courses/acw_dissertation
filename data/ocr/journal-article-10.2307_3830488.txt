Exceptions to this have occurred, as when working with nongame species causing economic damage or danger to public health; but most wildlife managers have been educated and oriented to work with species important to sport hunters, and managers have found most of their employment opportunities in agencies di- rected toward that interest. This situation is changing. Society is becoming more broadly concerned about wildlife resources. Concern for endangered species and appreciation for the esthetic value of all wildlife is increasing. Social values, consequently, are demanding greater attention to nongame species in conservation work. Among the nongame species requiring attention are populations of monkeys and apes whose existence is threatened by human interference. Some of these popu- lations of subhuman primates are losing habitat because of commercial timber cutting or land clearing for agriculture. Other populations are affected directly by people killing them for food or to prevent them from damaging crops; still others are being captured in large numbers for sale as pets or laboratory subjects (Conway 1966, Napier 1968). In some countries where populations of monkeys or apes are diminishing, governments are realizing the significance of losing these animals and want to preserve them in natural free- ranging conditions, a job logically belong- ing to the wildlife manager. Opportunities may arise for wildlife managers to assist in planning and super- vising management programs, and if this comes about managers will need to become familiar with primatology. Primatology is a multidisciplinary subject consisting of anthropology, psychology, zoology, ecol- ogy, and other biological fields. Although members of these disciplines study various aspects of primate life history, they are uni- fied by a common interest in the complex social behavior and group organization with which subhuman primates adapt to the environment (Kummer 1971). Prima- tologists study these phenomena to develop hypotheses about the origins of man's social behavior (Mason 1968a, Napier 1968, Rule 1967). In studying primatology, wildlife managers can not only work more effec- tively with monkeys and apes, but can also learn new concepts that apply to other spe- cies of animals. Some of our explanatory or background information and literature references will seem superfluous to primatologists. We have included this information for the benefit of readers whom we hope will ap- preciate the opportunity to explore new ideas. In July 1966, we captured 56 of 82 rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta Zimmerman, con- stituting one of 7 free-ranging, mutually antagonistic, social groups on Cayo Santi- ago, Puerto Rico, and moved them to Desecheo Island where they encountered a different environment. The 26 group members remaining on Cayo Santiago also experienced a significant change in their environment. Before the group was di- vided, its size and aggressiveness enabled it to occupy the median position in the intergroup dominance hierarchy. With two-thirds of the original membership gone, the remainder of the altered group began a new relationship with the other groups. Both of these situations provided unusual opportunities to study social behavior and ecology in the adaptation of a primate group. For the residual group remaining at Cayo Santiago, we were concerned with potential changes in both intra- and inter- group behavior. In the animals moved to Desecheo, we studied responses to a new habitat uninfluenced by the presence of other rhesus groups. In both situations, we could observe the effect of change on dominance, group coordination and co- hesion, response to and use of habitat components, spatial distribution of in- dividuals in the group, travel patterns, 6</page><page sequence="5">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel stability of family ties, behavior typical of sex and age classes, food habits, reproduc- tive biology, mortality, and pre-existing behavioral characteristics in general. We could also observe the effects of separating some individuals from the social protection of their relatives (Koford 1963, Sade 1965). Many descriptive studies have now been made of social behavior in wild subhuman primates living undisturbed in their natal home ranges to which they are long adapted. At least two descriptions have been made of free-ranging groups of primates which have experienced cata- strophic environmental changes (Hall 1963a, Loy 1970). To our knowledge, how- ever, no other field study has been made on a long-existing, free-ranging group of primates whose environment and member- ship have been changed deliberately by men wanting to observe the resulting effects. Comprehensive field studies of natural social behavior of free-ranging primates began about 4 decades ago as naturalistic descriptions of social organization and habitat requirements of species (Nissen 1931, Bingham 1932). Published infor- mation about primate social biology up to that time was mainly anthropomorphic opinion, but it did reveal a growing reali- zation that primates live in organized, stable groups having coordinated activities rather than as temporary aggregations of randomly assorted individuals (Zuckerman 1932). Aside from a few field studies, how- ever, most research was on captive in- dividuals and unnatural groups held in stressful conditions. Behavior was ex- plained simply as reciprocal interactions between individuals whose responses are innate fixed action patterns (Crook 1970a). Pioneering field biologists objected to this approach. They realized that ecological considerations are important (Zuckerman 1932), and sought to investigate social behavior more objectively by studying free- ranging groups. Carpenter improved the analytic quality of field research through his classic studies of 1934, 1935, 1940, and 1942a in which he observed the principle of studying animals living in natural groups in the environment to which they are adapted through natural selection (Car- penter 1942b). Despite the examples of Carpenter's studies, behavioral research stayed in the laboratories, and systematic field investi- gations did not become prominent until long-term population studies were taken up in 1948 by the Japanese Primate Research Group (Itani 1954, Frisch 1959), in 1956 by Altmann (1962), and later by Koford (1965, 1966). Since then, field studies have "proliferated at an unbelievable rate" (DeVore 1965), as illustrated graphically by Altmann (1967). Field studies became one of the greatest interests in the be- havioral sciences, but they developed in- dependently of laboratory research rather than become coordinated with it (Hall 1968). Menzel (1967) and Mason (1968b) criticized the disadvantages of this sepa- ration and advocated closer interdiscipli- nary ties. The expanding knowledge of primate social biology has been summarized well in several comprehensive reviews (Chance and Jolly 1970; Crook 1970a, 1970b; Crook and Gartlan 1966; Gartlan 1968; Hall 1965b; Imanishi 1960; Kummer 1971; Ma- son 1968b; Rowell 1967; Struhsaker 1969). Formerly, the primate group was believed to have rigid, unvariable structure typical of its species throughout its range and maintained through sexual bonds and dominance hierarchies. Investigators cata- loged attributes of behavior and habitat requirements to characterize and distin- guish species, and they seemed more in- terested in extending their studies to undescribed species than in confirming or elaborating findings in species already de- scribed (Gartlan and Brain 1968). Empha- sis was placed on results rather than on processes of learning (Washburn and Hamburg 1965), on proximate causation rather than on adaptive function resulting from evolution. Research emphasis has shifted from de- 7</page><page sequence="6">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS fining "normal" or "typical" characteristics of species to analyzing the social group as a basic unit of adaptation. This shift came about mainly because of studies that show wide differences in the characteristics of social behavior and social organization of a given species in different habitats. For example, variations of organization and behavior in relation to habitat differences are found in Japanese macaques Macaca fuscata Blyth throughout the islands of Japan (Frisch 1959, 1968). The same is true of rhesus (Southwick et al. 1965) and langur monkeys Presbytis entellus Dufresne (Jay 1965; Sugiyama 1965, 1967; Yoshiba 1968) in India. Southwick et al. (1965) noted that the rhesus is adapted to so many different habitats in India that its "natural habitat" cannot be typified. The savannah baboon Papio cynocephalus L. is attributed with having similar social char- acteristics over its range in east and south Africa (DeVore and Hall 1965, Hall and DeVore 1965). Rowell (1966) commented that field studies on savannah baboons had been restricted to open grasslands or savan- nahs, creating the biased belief that these baboons were adapted only to savannah, whereas they actually live in forests throughout much of their range. Rowell's (1966) observations on forest-dwelling baboons revealed considerable behavior differing from that attributed to open- country baboons, and Rowell (1967) later questioned whether any species has a "normal" social structure. Conversely, dis- similar species may have similar features in a particular kind of habitat. An inter- specific behavioral similarity exists among hamadryas baboons Papio hamadryas L., gelada baboons Theropithecus gelada Riippell, and patas monkeys Erythrocebus patas Schreiber, all of which live in open habitats in different regions of Africa. Each species has developed a one-male group organization in which adult males and their harems range apart in daily foraging (Crook 1966, Hall 1965a, Kum- mer 1967). Crook and Gartlan (1966) categorized various kinds of primates into 5 grades of social systems according to kinds of environment inhabited and biolog- ical attributes. Their purpose was to show that a given type of environment induces the evolution of a characteristic social system among primate species adapting to it. Kummer (1967), however, believed that no single kind of environment could reveal all potential phenotypic variability within a genotype. The primate social group is a compli- cated, dynamic, but balanced system shaped by continuous interaction of genetic and environmental variables (Crook 1970b). Free-ranging primates survive principally in groups, and the behavior of an in- dividual is meaningful only in terms of its membership in a group. The group is, therefore, the basic unit in which to study learning processes, social roles, and be- havior patterns having capacities for vari- ations in different contexts (Hall 1968, Kummer 1971, Mason 1968b). Future primatologic studies will seek the identities, manners of function, and relative im- portance of genetic and environmental factors responsible for establishing, main- taining, and controlling social organization of the group, especially in its ability to remain stable under stress or to accommo- date to rapid changes in the environment. It is important that we learn the relation- ship between social behavior and social organization. Behavior and organization seem logically interrelated, but the paths of mutual influence between them are not yet explained (our working definitions are given later). Various reports indicate that the form of social organization is molded by the pattern of behavior. Scott (1956) sug- gested that social behavior leads to social relationships which determine the form of social organization, but both he and Kum- mer (1967) emphasized that social be- havior is not identical with social orga- nization. Kummer explained that social behavior is genetically characteristic of the species, but that kinds of organizations occur ". . . without apparent relationship 8</page><page sequence="7">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel to taxonomy or to patterns of social be- havior." Kummer hypothesized that among various species of subhuman primates, social behavior is not the cause of organi- zation, but that organization is a flexible characteristic which is modifiable in re- sponse to immediate survival needs and is therefore designed contemporaneously by the group's habitat. Several investigators have recommended that future primatologic field research should include more experimental study to analyze social phenomena, but there are few concrete suggestions for objectives or methods. Groups can be altered by remov- ing or adding members (Carpenter 1942a, 1942b) or components of the environment can be changed (Menzel 1966). The pro- cedures by which groups originate have been studied in unacquainted monkeys col- lected haphazardly from their original set- tings then released together in a new area (Kawai 1960, Vandenbergh 1967), but there have been no comprehensive tests of the stability of a long-organized group coming under great stress. Kummer (1967) recommended that samples of a population be transferred to new environments and studied for at least 2 generations to de- scribe intraspecific variations of behavior or organization. Hall (1963a, 1963b) sug- gested inducing drastic environmental changes in the area used by a group. Whatever approach is taken, variables in a field experiment of this scope are extremely difficult to control, especially climate, pre- dation, food supply, individual social ex- perience, and group composition (Mason 1968b). Expenses and logistical problems are considerable. With this background in mind, we ob- served the effects of altering a group's en- vironment when Desecheo Island was acquired for the site of a new colony of rhesus to be started with monkeys from Cayo Santiago. We recognized the value of moving an existing social group rather than an assortment of unacquainted ani- mals, so we planned accordingly when the time came to transfer monkeys to the new colony. Our study was not a controlled experi- ment. It was a quasi experiment (Camp- bell and Stanley 1966) intended to describe the more overt responses of the group members to the change induced in their circumstances. We could not manipulate variables in a controlled sense other than to expose one part of the original group to a new habitat and subject the other part to a new relationship with other groups in the original location. Other responsibilities and transportation difficulties prevented us from maintaining continuous observations at Desecheo and from making sufficiently intensive observations to detect and mea- sure in detail all of the probable effects from the post-division situations. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, financed this study principally through the Laboratory of Perinatal Physiol- ogy. Additional support from the NIH was provided to Menzel from a grant (FR00164) to the Delta Regional Primate Research Center while he was associated with that institution, and from another grant to us for publication costs. We are grateful to Ronald E. Myers, Chief, Lab- oratory of Perinatal Physiology for his encouragement and help throughout the study. Henry J. Wagner, Director of Intra- mural Research, NINDS, helped us obtain funds for publishing the monograph. We are especially indebted to Carlos Nagel, Construction and Maintenance Su- perintendent of the LPP, who designed and supervised the construction of trails, camps, and storage facilities at Desecheo Island and was extremely helpful in arranging transportation, supplies, and radio com- munications. His thoughtful and energetic support greatly facilitated our efforts. Assisting in various tasks at both study areas were Victor Bracero, Israel Cordero, William Draper, G.

STUDY AREAS Cayo Santiago Cayo Santiago lies at 18?09' N and 65? 44' W 1 km off the eastern end of Puerto Rico. Although it has been described previously by Carpenter (1942a), Altmann (1962), Heatwole et al. (1963), and Koford (1963), its main characteristics are pre- sented here for comparison with Desecheo Island. Plants from both islands are identi- fied according to Urban (1903-1911) and Little and Wadsworth (1964). Two islets or cays connected by a nar- row isthmus make up Cayo Santiago (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Their total area is 15 hectares (ha). Each cay consists mainly of a hill of volcanic rock approximately 35 m in height and tending to be steeper and rockier on the eastern side. These hills slope down to flat areas adjacent to each end of the isthmus, which is a gravel bar or tombolo. The flats and the isthmus rise &lt; 2 m above sea level. The hills of both cays are wooded with Corcho Torrubia fragans (Dum.-Cours.) Standley, roble blanco Tabebuia hetero- phylla (DC.) Britton, and pendula Citharexylum fruticosum L. A coconut Cocos nucifera L. plantation occupies the flat, northern part of the larger cay which 10</page><page sequence="9">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel -NORTH SHORE BAY POINT CHURCH POINT PALM o--- POINT ?

Along the shores of both cays and the isthmus are Australian pine Casuarina equisetifolia L. and sea grape Coccoloba uvifera (L.) L. Almendra trees Terminalia catappa L. were once common on the flat areas of both cays; browsing by the monkeys has damaged or killed all of them. The thombush sota- caballo or tintillo Randia aculeata L. is scattered over both cays and forms thickets at the south end of the coconut plantation. Poison mancinella Hippomane mancinella L. grows on the isthmus. Caro Cissus sicyoides L., a vine, grows on other vegeta- tion everywhere and is particularly abun- dant on sea grape and tintillo. A permanent trail system facilitates pas- sage by observers and animal caretakers. Monkey chow is placed in hog feeders at stations under galvanized metal roofs.

A large cement catchment basin and cistern on each cay collects and stores several thousand gallons of rain water for the dry seasons. The cisterns are connected by pipes to the water systems at feeding stations. Other terrestrial animals on Cayo Santi- ago are rats, lizards, and amphibians (de- scribed by Heatwole et al. 1963). Hermit crabs Coenobita clypeatus Herbst, fiddler crabs Uca sp., and land crabs Cardisoma guanhumi Latreille are abundant. The climate in eastern Puerto Rico is warm and humid. Northeasterly winds moderate the temperature of which monthly averages range from 24 to 28 C and the annual mean is 26 C. Rainfall totals range from 150 to 200 cm annually, most of which falls in the second half of the year. In the drier, cooler part of the year, from December through April, leaves drop from several species of trees and herbaceous plants wither. The rhesus colony was established in 1939 with 400 monkeys imported directly from India by Carpenter and Tomilin (Carpenter 1942a). Several hundred mon- keys were removed during World War II and in the years preceding acquisition of the colony by NIH in 1956 (Frontera 1958). Apart from provisioning the mon- keys with commercial chow and trapping them for marking or examining, humans have interfered little with the colony since 1956, when long-term studies commenced, and few animals were removed until 1966. A small caretaking crew is present on weekdays. Visitors are principally scientists studying disease, behavior, reproduction, and population dynamics (Altmann 1962; Carpenter 1942a; Conaway and Koford 1965; Conaway and Sade 1965; Draper 1966; Fisler 1967; Kaufmann 1965, 1966; Koford 1963, 1965, 1966; Sade 1964, 1965, 1967; Shah and Morrison 1969; Vessey and Morrison 1970). Desecheo Island Desecheo Island is a mountain peak emerging from the sea 20 km off Puerto Rico's west coast at 18o23' N and 67?29' W (Figs. 4, 5). Desecheo's map area is 122 ha, but it has greater surface area because it rises to 208 m elevation and has many steep slopes and ridges. The north side is extremely precipitous and rough. Three parallel valleys occupy the south- western side. Level areas are few and small; slopes drop abruptly into the sea. A few short narrow beaches occur along a shoreline consisting mainly of large jagged rocks. Three small bays afford boat land- ings during calm seas. A helicopter pad at the southwest corner of the island pro- vides continuous access. Continuous long-term meterological rec- ords for Desecheo are not available, but its vegetation is typical of extremely dry sites on Caribbean islands and is similar in species composition to nearby Mona Island and to parts of southwestern Puerto Rico which are drier and warmer than Cayo Santiago. Monthly averages of temperature at La Parguera, near the southwestern comer of Puerto Rico, range from 25 to 29 C; the annual mean is 27 C. Rainfall at La Parguera and at Mona total 50 to 100 cm annually at each site. Desecheo receives a like amount, judging by its vegetation and by comparing our 12</page><page sequence="11">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel FIG. 4. Aerial view of Desecheo Island from the southwest, showing the helicopter pad on the near point. periodic weather measurements there to those of Mona and La Parguera. Vegetation on Desecheo Island includes much cactus. Opuntia dilenii (Ker-Gawler) Haworth, Cactus intortus Miller, Harrisia portoricensis Britton, and Cephalocereus royenii (L.) Britton and Rose are abundant. Grasses and sedges are common. The south side of the island supports a forest domi- nated by almacigo Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. and contains San Bartolome or Capa Cordia sebestena L., te Amyris elemifera L., palinguan Capparis flexuosa (L.) L., burro blanco Capparis portoricensis Urban, mangle bot6n Conocarpus erectus L., corcho blanco Pisonia subcordata Sw., cojoba Pithecolobium arboreum (L.) Urban, ufia de gato Pithecolobium unguis- cati (L.) Benth., bumelia Bumelia Krugi Pierre, tabacon Solanum rugosum Dum., pendula, and cambr6n Casearia aculeata Jacq. Sea grape occurs in small groves along the shore. Caro is common, and an epiphytic bromeliad, probably Tillandsia sp., grows on trees, cactus, and the ground. Herbaceous vegetation includes Calonyction sp. and Commelina sp. The most common grasses are Panicum sp., Paspalum sp., and Setaria sp. The extremely steep north and east slopes of Desecheo support few trees. These slopes have more exposed rock and poorer soil. Cacti and grasses are the most common plants there. Before transferring monkeys to Desecheo, we cut trails on all major ridges and on the south and west coasts. We established a camp and installed a large water tank to store rainwater running off the helicopter pad. Desecheo supports numerous rats, land crabs, hermit crabs, feral house cats, and feral domestic goats. Great numbers of sea birds roost and nest on Desecheo.

SUBJECTS AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS Since 1956, essentially all monkeys on Cayo Santiago have been tattooed (Fig. 6) with distinctive identifications (Koford 1966). By mid-1966 the total population numbered 683 monkeys in 7 social groups. Arranged in order by decreasing group dominance, the respective groups con- tained 221 (Group C), 194 (A), 78 (E), 14</page><page sequence="13">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel FIG. 6.

Group J was the newest; it separated from Group A in 1964. Group H, the experimental group, originated in 1960 when former Group G divided into Groups H and I (Koford 1963). The proportions of age and sex classes in Group H (Table 1) were similar to the average proportions in the total island population except for the high proportion of female infants and lack of 3-year-old males. H was unique in having 3 males and 1 female that had been castrated when infants, all of which were 4 years old in 1966. Apart from the adult males, 8 genealogi- cal aggregations constituted Group H (Fig. 7), and the full extent to which relatives were separated by the experimental di- vision of the group is illustrated. The composition of the two subgroups created by sending part of Group H to Desecheo Island is shown in Table 2; each subgroup is still referred to as a group. The literature holds a confusing variety of names for the characteristics of primate biology. Ethologists, psychologists, anthro- pologists, zoologists, and others have flavored the literature with jargon from each specialty so that an attribute may have several different names, or a given descriptive term may signify different meanings to different disciplines (Aldrich- Blake 1970, Crook 1970b). An adequate glossary of these terms has yet to be written, so we are defining here some of our key terms. The social unit we call a "group" is a discrete aggregation containing adult, sub- adult, and infant monkeys of both sexes which mate, travel, rest, and feed together; it remains spatially apart from other groups and discourages recruitment of new mem- bers from other groups. Membership is' lifelong or of extremely long duration. Members of the group exchange signals which affect or coordinate their activities as a whole (DeVore 1965, Kummer 1967). Other writers have called the group a "band," "troop," "oikia," "herd," or "congre- gation." When several members range apart from the main body, or when the group temporarily fragments into several independent units, we call these subunits "parties." "Subgroups" are the 2 parts of Group H formed in the division of July 1966. "Social behavior" and "social organi- zation" are terms used frequently in primatologic literature. They are used inter- changeably with other terms such as "struc- ture," "function," "system," "pattern," and "network," but none of these has been defined clearly. Our concept of social behavior is that it consists of the species- characteristic motor actions and com- munications by which group members interact, influence each other's actions, and coordinate overall group activity. Social organization we understand to be the man- ner in which members of the group are positioned in space and time relative to each other and to other features of the environment. At the base of organization lies group size, sex and age composition, 15</page><page sequence="14">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS TABLE 1.-IDENTrrIES OF GROUP H MEMBERS BY AGE AND SEX, JUNE 1966.

The dominant male in complete control of a group is not only superior to all others individually, but also exerts power- ful influence on the collective activity, dis- persion, and behavior of the entire group largely because he is the primary, uncon- tested disciplinarian. The definition of "adaptation" is often restricted to indicate the process or the end result of evolutionary selection of a species' genetic fitness to thrive in a given eco- system. This treatise is concerned with immediate reaction, or lack of same, in response to a suddenly changed environ- ment and with modification of overt char- acteristics or elicitation of latent ones in maintaining individual or collective in- tegrity. Consequently, "adaptation" is employed synonymously with "accommoda- tion" or "adjustment." Peripheral males are subadults that usually stay at the edge of the group (Koford 1963). METHODS Our choice of Group H for this study was based on its size and rank among the 7 groups on Cayo Santiago. We wanted a group large enough to demonstrate poten- tial variations of response to the new habitat on Desecheo Island but small enough to find should it dissociate into parties over the larger area available. We also wanted a group occupying a rank near the intergroup median so that we could observe interactions between residual members and formerly subordinate groups after the division. Monkeys for Desecheo were either trapped in large cages built over 2 of the chow-feeding stations (Fig. 8) or adminis- tered Sernylan (Parke, Davis and Co.) by projectile syringe. Both methods soon alarm uncaptured monkeys, making them wary of traps and people, so we caught all animals possible in a 5-day period then moved them en masse to Desecheo in U. S. Navy helicopters. We trapped and moved the Desecheo group in July to avoid inter- fering with the mating season, which com- mences in August, and the birth season, which ends in June. All castrates were left on Cayo Santiago for other studies. Year- ling male Dl was sent to a laboratory. Infants were not tattooed because we deemed it inadvisable to heighten the stress of capture or to cause lesions which might become infected. To determine the effects of the experi- mental changes, we compared behavioral and organizational characteristics of the 18</page><page sequence="17">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel .

Cage over chow-feeding station is at upper right. new subgroups with the characteristics of the original intact group. Rhesus on Cayo Santiago are long accustomed to humans, and workers can remain close to or within a group for long periods. Maintenance personnel constantly census the population, recording births, deaths, and identities of participants in noteworthy activities. We observed the original group 350 hr from November 1965 to June 1966. After remov- ing the Desecheo colonists, the subgroup remaining on Cayo Santiago was observed 400 hr between July 1966 and June 1967. Observations at Cayo Santiago were made on week days, averaging 4 days each week, usually during the morning hours. After- noon observation periods took place 2 or 3 times each month. Prevailing explanations and theories in the literature about social behavior and group organization were em- ployed as criteria for demonstrating post- divisional changes. Monkeys at Desecheo could not be visited as frequently as those at Cayo Santiago because Desecheo is remote and regular transportation to it is difficult. We visited Desecheo 8 times, including the initial trip to release the monkeys (Table 3), and obtained 495 man-hours of obser- vations with the help of other biologists 19</page><page sequence="18">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS TABLE 3.-SCHEDULE OF VISITS TO DESECHEO ISLAND WITH THE NUMBERS OF OBSERVERS AND THE MAN-HOURS OF OBSERVATION FOR EACH VISIT Number Man-Hours Trip of of No. Dates of Visits Observers Observations 1 1-8 July 1966 4 243 2 5-8 August 1966 3 54 3 10-11 October 1966 3 24 4 16-20 February 1967 2 19 5 8-9 May 1967 1 12 6 7-10 August 1967 2 45 7 27-30 May 1968 4 48 8 11-20 May 1971 3 50 and animal caretakers. Observation periods took place between daybreak and dusk, but often continued throughout the day. When 2 or more observers were present, they usually worked independently. Each observer recorded on scale maps (Fig. 5) his estimates of the group's location at periodic intervals, made a daily census of members, wrote on-the-spot notes on be- havior, and periodically summarized his impressions of general conditions and events. The study was principally quali- tative, but observers agreed closely on important issues. When we first noted an apparent difference between postdivision and predivision behavior, we alerted others to watch especially closely for such events to judge their consistency. For several years, natural food had been insufficient to support the rhesus popula- tion on Cayo Santiago, so commercial monkey chow was provided at an average rate of 0.2 kg per monkey daily. The chow was distributed 3 times weekly to the 6 feeding stations (Fig. 2). Monkeys at Desecheo were required to forage on natural foods. On a few occasions we put out small amounts of fruit or chow to briefly consolidate individuals for census- ing, but this was insignificant in the total food supply. RESULTS Behavior of the Original Group Before Division, 1965-1966 Dominance Hierarchy and Individual Characteristics A prominent feature of rhesus monkey society is a dominance hierarchy sometimes enforced with physical attack but more often manifested in aggressive postures or TABLE 4.-DOMINANCE HIERARCHY OF GROUP-H ADULTS (&gt; 5 YEARS OF AGE) AND SUBADULTS (4-5 YEARS OF AGE), JUNE 1966.

Our estimate of the individual dominance status of adults and subadults in Group H as judged from the results of fights, intimi- dations, and displacements from positions at food, water, or resting places indicated that adult males dominated all other in- dividuals (Table 4). The most dominant females ranked next. Subordinate adult females more than 7 years of age were dominant over males 4-6 years old which in turn dominated females of age 4-6 years. The ranks of individuals less than 4 years of age are not listed, but their positions within their age groups were generally comparable to their mothers' ranks. Males:- Males 132, BC, Sll, and KP main- tained a distinct, straightline hierarchy among themselves and could displace all other group members from food and pre- ferred places. Their displays of hostile facial expressions, body postures, or vocali- zations usually produced cowering, shriek- ing, or withdrawal in the threatened mon- keys, but in some instances they were resisted by adult females (Fig. 9). Threats were occasionally intensified into physical attack. The dominant male was 132, the largest and oldest male in the group. His suprem- acy was shown in threatening and punish- ing rather than in leading group activities. He rarely joined intergroup combat unless it began near him or was widespread and unusually violent. The other dominant males frequently moved around the group's periphery, apparently patrolling against intruders. We define patrolling as pro- longed moving about outside the group, chasing back monkeys approaching from other groups, giving alarm if other monkeys approach, or inciting an attack on the in- truders. Male 132 rarely patrolled and spent most of his time at the group center reclining or sitting when all were resting, or travelling with adult females during group moves. Occasionally he initiated moves or traveled at the head of the group. All group members were quick to groom FIG. 9.

All seemed cowed and submissive at his approach, especially when he threatened them. Adult males presented their posteriors for him to mount, females and subadult males cringed, turned their heads away, and froze in place or flattened themselves to the ground. BC, second to 132 in rank, was more ac- tive in group defense and exhibited actual leadership more often than did other males. BC often headed the column during group moves. If he met monkeys of a dominant group, he returned to redirect H's line of march. BC frequently patrolled around the group periphery and joined any intergroup 21</page><page sequence="20">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS fight involving Group H. He also broke up intragroup fights by attacking the participants. BC often attacked and chased adult females. Unlike 132, BC was occasionally counterattacked jointly by adult females defending his victim. Male 132 sometimes helped them, and on one occasion all severely wounded BC with bites. BC started some fights by tormenting an im- mature monkey until its mother threatened him, whereupon he attacked her. The third-ranking male, Sll, fed and groomed with the group, but was com- monly absent during rests and moves. He patrolled outside the group more than did BC. He sometimes was absent for several days. When with the group, Sll joined most intergroup conflicts. He was as ag- gressive as BC to females and was partic- ularly aggressive to peripheral males. The fourth-ranking male, KP, rarely patrolled; he remained with adult females which he attacked less frequently than did BC or Sll. He sometimes joined BC in attacking females, but when he was alone the females were more apt to band together and repulse him than they would more dominant males. KP fought aggressively in intergroup battles. Although KP was usually with the adult females, he groomed with them about half as often as did BC or Sll. He groomed much with the peripheral males and juveniles. This action probably reflected a status lower than that of BC or Sll. The fifth fully adult male, CE, had the lowest adult status in the group. He joined Group H in December 1965, but was present infrequently until May 1966, when he stayed at the group periphery con- stantly. CE was furtive and aloof, avoid- ing other monkeys and retreating quickly when threatened by them. No other mon- key groomed with him. Subadults and im- matures ignored him; the other peripheral males attacked him often. CE entered a feeder for chow only after all others were finished, and he was always at the extreme rear during group moves. CE never par- ticipated in fights between Group H and other groups. The young adult males, HM, NE, and JZ, remained at the group periphery and on occasion were chased from the group center by the adults. HM was often alone, but NE and JZ were together frequently. They visited the chow feeders after the group had fed and moved on, and they kept to the rear of the group during the moves. Together or singly they made attacks on immatures or subadults, attacks which commonly resulted in counterattacks from adult females. They patrolled and joined dominant males in fighting against monkeys from other groups. Four-year-old males NO, NQ, and UU were subordinate to the peripheral males but were tolerated within adult company, probably because their mothers and other relatives were present and possibly because they were castrates. NV, an intact 4-year- old male and the son of S17, one of the group's most dominant females, was domi- nant to adult females ranking below R04 and 80 in the female hierarchy (Table 4), to castrates, and to peripheral males, at- tacking them as frequently and as vigor- ously as did adult males. Females:-The dominance hierarchy of adult females was not as closely correlated with age as was the male hierarchy (Table 4). The progenitors of genealogies and their adult daughters had the highest ranks; ranks of other females were based more on individual aggressiveness and the effectiveness of support from adult rel- atives than on age or size. The females of apparently equal rank, such as 84 and S17, were not aggressive to each other although both were clearly dominant to others of lower ranking. Female 84 showed domi- nance mainly in displacements of others from chow feeders. Female S17 frequently attacked other females in all daily activi- ties, in addition to displacing them from food. Because she enforced dominance more actively than 84, S17 was rated as the dominant female of the group. Fe- 22</page><page sequence="21">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel male 97 was presumed to be either a daughter or a sister of 84. S17, 84, and 97 were close companions in all activities and participated more extensively in intergroup combat than the other adult females of Group H. R04 and 80 were similar to S17 and 84 in that both clearly dominated their sub- ordinates, but R04 did so in a higher rate of attacks in a wider array of circumstances. The positions of CU and AH were unclear. AH was extremely shy. She remained apart from other adults, giving the impression that she ranked extremely low and avoided others to prevent being attacked. CU as- sociated freely with all adult females, but was never seen to be attacked by them or by male NV. She was not seen in aggres- sive interactions with females ranked above HT and AM; she could, however, attack or displace any female ranked below R04 and 80. Some individuals were particularly ag- gressive to certain of their subordinates as if having special animosity toward them. Male 132 most frequently attacked BC. KP was especially hostile to NE, and HM frequently attacked JZ. S17 was highly aggressive to HT and 97, attacking the latter viciously in more encounters than seen between any other females in the group. At such times, 84 would pull S17 away, hold her arms about her, and make placatory behaviors ("lip smacks," Altmann 1962) until S17 became calm. The close- ness of S17 and 97 at other times makes these attacks difficult to understand. Female 97 was exceedingly hostile to AM, and HL often attacked CM. Among younger animals, NX attacked TE fre- quently. NV had no special victim. He harassed all of his subordinates constantly. Aggression is emphasized here to illustrate the manner of hierarchical ranking but not to imply that conflict was an overriding preoccupation of the group. The frequency and intensity of aggressive behavior varied considerably from time to time, but was especially frequent during the autumn mating season and in interactions at the feeding stations. Occasionally it was pro- longed and vigorous. For the most part, aggression was a chronic undertone of minor intimidations, threats, or displace- ments accompanying the various group activities. Intragroup Relations Regardless of what Group H was doing, most of its members performed their in- dividual activities in association with one or more other members. It was extremely unusual for a group member to act com- pletely alone except in the extragroup patrol of an adult or peripheral male. Al- though individuals sharing a common ac- tivity might become separated by 15-25 m, their behavior disclosed that they could see or hear each other. During most of the daily activity, the distance between individuals was &lt; 10 m. Individuals were most often found within characteristic parts of the main group. Adult females, infants, and yearlings formed the largest and most cohesive as- sociation. Usually, they constituted the main body of the group, especially when all were together, and they acted together in much of their activity. Dominant males were commonly with these members. The pe- ripheral males formed another association. They were occasionally joined by males of other age classes for grooming, but pe- ripheral males were seldom with the fe- males and young. In the few instances when peripheral males approached the principal site of group activity, they were soon chased away by adults. A third association, usually formed when the main group was relaxed and stationary, consisted of im- mature animals 1-4 years old temporarily leaving the adult females to form play and exploration parties either within or just outside the area currently occupied by the group. These parties occasionally roamed 50-75 m away from the main group to visit feeders, seek natural food in the trees, watch other groups, or harass humans. The strongest affinities between any Group H monkeys were between related 23</page><page sequence="22">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS FIG. 10. An adult female nurses her infant while being groomed, June 1966. members, particularly females. Male off- spring began to associate in their own parties at 2-3 years of age, spending much time away from their relatives. Females remained close to their mothers and sisters, and the old progenitor was thus the nucleus of a small band containing her adult daughters and their offspring (Fig. 7). Relatives defended each other, especially when striving to get chow from a feeder or when threatened by other monkeys. At other times they would dissociate and inter- act freely with members of other genealo- gies. Infants remained close to their mothers and relatives at all times and seemed to require much protection. Infants at Cayo Santiago that were orphaned before 4 months of age seldom survived, possibly because they lacked milk. If older than 4 months they could survive if cared for by an older monkey, usually a close relative (Koford 1963). Their principal needs ap- peared to be protection from attack by other monkeys, especially when trying to get food from the feeding stations. Adult females were extremely protective of infants. Mothers kept their newborn young within a few meters of themselves during their first 5-8 weeks of life and kept unrelated monkeys away from them (Kaufmann 1966). At 8-10 weeks of age, infants began to wander extensively about the vicinity of their mothers, playing with other infants and immatures, but seldom went &gt; 15 m away from her or stayed &gt; 15 min without returning to her. If an infant screamed, several adults, including males, would rush to defend it or carry it to safety. When 6-12 months old, infants joined increasingly in play with 1-3-year-old immatures. A yearling received less ma- ternal attention after its mother produced another infant, but it still remained close by her. If she failed to give birth, the yearling continued nursing for several more 24</page><page sequence="23">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel months. Play occurred almost incessantly during the day; it intensified after feeding, diminished after the group had rested for some time, and ceased temporarily during intergroup conflict or rapid travel. Wres- tling, chasing, and mounting activities often included 6-8 immatures which frolicked back and forth between the ground and the tree tops. The participants might range 15-35 m from the main group, but ap- peared to remain aware of the location of the adults and would return to them quickly if alarmed or if a group move commenced. Despite the great amount of time at play, immatures &lt; 2 years of age spent much time resting, grooming, and feeding with their mothers and siblings. Grooming occurred intermittently throughout the day (Figs. 6, 10). During any kind of group activity, at least one pair of monkeys might pause to groom, if only briefly. A strong indication of the closeness of related rhesus is their tendency to groom together more often than with monkeys unrelated to them. Grooming is one of the commonest activities shared by members of a genealogy (Sade 1965). Extragenealogical grooming consisted mainly of adult females and subadults of both sexes grooming adult males and of subdominant adult females grooming more dominant females. Unrelated juveniles fre- quently groomed each other during play. Intergroup Relations The relative dominance of social groups was demonstrated most emphatically in intergroup aggressive encounters. Mem- bers of dominant Groups A, C, and E were much bolder in all activities than monkeys of other groups. They travelled or stopped where they chose with no apparent concern for the proximity of escape cover or the locations of subordinate groups. Members of A, E, and especially C often scattered widely as individuals or as independent, apparently uncoordinated, parties perform- ing different activities with the same apparent self-confidence and forcefulness as when together in a single band. The smallest groups, I and J, occupying the bottom of the hierarchy, were compact associations in which members remained close together and acted in unison. These groups were more difficult to find than were H or F. They frequented heavy cover and locations distant from other groups. Groups I and J could be displaced quickly by 1 or 2 adult members of a dominant group, although I generally resisted H. I and J moved frequently, evidently to avoid other groups, and sometimes appeared har- ried and apprehensive even when a more dominant group was not present. They were easily displaced from feeding stations and were the last groups to get chow dur- ing feeding periods. Group H was intermediate to these ex- tremes. Its members usually engaged in a common activity during which they might become temporarily separated into 2 or 3 sections that kept within 30-40 m of each other, or they might spread out widely individually while remaining coordinated through visual or vocal communication. Individuals or parties of Group H oc- casionally left the main group to perform different activities 50-75 m away: males patrolled, various individuals visited feed- ers, immatures explored. These separations lasted up to 2 hr and included occasional returns to the main group. Group H com- monly rested or moved about leisurely and confidently for long periods in open areas. Although becoming warier and more con- solidated when doing so, Group H fre- quently travelled past the edge of a more dominant group while travelling or ap- proaching a feeder. The most forceful of Group H's inter- actions with other groups occurred at feed- ing stations. J usually abandoned a feeder when approached by H; Group I often tried to retain it. If these subordinate groups resisted, H chased them away. At times, small bands of subadults or im- matures from H displaced major portions of I or J if the latters' adult males were absent. F was more likely to resist than run from H and was more difficult to dis- 25</page><page sequence="24">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS place, but H invariably pushed F from the feeder. About 50% of H's aggressive en- counters with subdominant groups were with I and 25% each with F and J. When H encountered a more dominant group at a feeder, H's response depended upon the situation and the nature of the dominant group. H was most resistant to dominant groups after being denied posses- sion of a feeder for a prolonged time when hungry or when surprised by a sudden encounter. Monkeys of A or E commonly travelled or visited a feeder in sizeable numbers, and H avoided them, if possible, by vacating the feeder temporarily and waiting nearby. If A or E attacked H in moderate force, H members drew together and fought back while moving away. Only a few members of H might confront the aggressors. These members commonly in- cluded Males BC, Sll, and KP and several adult females. Subadult males also joined the fight while larger immatures threatened or vocalized loudly from trees or from the sidelines. H retreated until pursuit ended, then spread out again to resume routine activities. In most of these instances mem- bers of Group H soon returned to the vicinity from which they were evicted and awaited the aggressor's departure so they could feed again. When A or E attacked vigorously in large numbers, H consoli- dated into a close-packed mass &lt; 15 m diam and retreated quickly. If strongly pursued, H ran en masse to the rugged cliffs on the east shore of Cayo Grande, or into dense vegetation west of Dos Corchos, or to the south end of the island. Within 60-90 min, it usually returned to resting or feeding areas and resumed routine activities. H encountered C more often than it did any other group. C scattered out each day into several parties which roamed over the large cay. Monkeys of C were highly aggressive and remained so when in small parties, regardless of their numbers. A party from C containing 10-15 animals and lacking adult males could keep H from a feeder for a short time (Fig. 8). On such occasions, H remained nearby and if more C monkeys did not arrive soon, H drove them away. If the C party contained one or more adult males, it could keep H from the feeder, but H repeatedly tried to take the feeder from them. A larger party of C containing 20-30 or more animals, includ- ing several adult males, could chase H from the feeder area and force it to go else- where. In this event, H consolidated and left ahead of C's arrival if forewarned; if sur- prised, H fought until it could get away from the attackers. As with A or E, an overwhelming attack from C sent H on the run immediately, but H soon resumed normal group activity elsewhere. When H was travelling, resting, or seek- ing natural foods and it met another group, the dominant group sometimes pressed an attack immediately. It was more likely that the subordinate group anticipated and avoided the meeting by diverting its line of march or by moving to another resting location while seeming alert and ready to react appropriately should the dominant group attack. In several encounters when H was the subordinate group, H moved aside very slightly and the main parts of each group were &lt; 10 m apart, yet H adults appeared unconcerned and did not inter- rupt their occupations. Subadults and juveniles from each group often threatened each other, even though the adults did not interact. Intergroup conflict resulted from adult and subadult males of dominant groups roaming out singly or in bands of 2-6 animals and seeming to start fights deliber- ately. If they were older, larger males, they might assault directly the main body of a subordinate group, causing it to flee. If they were subadult or peripheral males, they attacked females and younger animals in the subordinate group. Subordinate- group adults and males then arrived, the fight intensified, and more monkeys from the dominant group came to drive the sub- ordinates away. Peripheral males from a subordinate group sometimes attacked sub- adult or juvenile members of a dominant 26</page><page sequence="25">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel group. At such times the dominant-group monkeys were joined by adults from their group and all pursued the retreating sub- dominant-group monkeys to the main part of the subordinate group and attacked it. Adult males of H displaced J easily, but they usually had more difficulty displacing Group I. F was stronger than I and could drive off harassing H males unless other H monkeys reinforced them. Sll and JZ frequently became involved in fights with C, E, or F monkeys. BC and KP by them- selves occasionally chased the entire mem- bership of I or J. Reactions to Other Species of Animals For the most part, members of H seemed to ignore nonprimate animals. Rats, lizards, and hermit crabs ate monkey chow, and if one of these animals came close to a mon- key at a feeder, the monkey usually moved aside or slapped it away. Immature mon- keys took chow from crabs and lizards, and they manipulated or mouthed cock- roaches. Male BC once vigorously slapped and rolled a hermit crab over the ground after he had been attacked by 132. On another occasion, several individuals ap- proached a dead sea bird to touch it quickly then run away, but most monkeys avoided it. Rats climbed upon drinking fountains for water (Fig. 11). When a rat was on a fountain, immature monkeys seldom drank from it, and avoided touch- ing the rat, but some adults reached out at arm's length to gingerly slap the rat off the fountain. Reactions to humans varied, but the monkeys seldom ignored people nearby. Rhesus on Cayo Santiago are long accus- tomed to humans and allow regular staff personnel to approach closely except when infants are present. We could remain within 5 m of most H members without causing undue alarm if we avoided staring directly at individuals, moved slowly, and did not surprise an infant. If we moved to within 3-4 m of a monkey, it threatened or grimaced (Altmann 1962, p. 378) at us and moved away &gt; 5 m, but did not be- FIG. 11.

He later slapped the rat away. come greatly alarmed although it watched us closely and often stimulated other mon- keys to move away or climb trees. Monkeys in trees could sometimes be approached to within 2 m. On occasions when we steadily observed an individual, dominant females or males became agitated and eventually chased it away from us. If we frightened a monkey, others came to threaten us; these were principally rel- atives of the frightened animal, but often included many of the adults in Group H. Adults came within 2-3 m and formed a ring around the offending person. They rushed in to slap his legs or ran down tree limbs to strike his head. Vocalizations and threat gestures were the same as those di- rected to monkeys. Adult males, especially 132 and BC, often threatened us when we approached the group, but they soon ignored us unless we approached too closely. These threats were milder than when defending a fright- ened group member. Immature monkeys 1-3 years old frequently threatened or 27</page><page sequence="26">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS ened us often but did not attack. RO4 and S17 struck observers with their hands on several occasions, usually approaching stealthily from behind to launch the attack from a short distance. NQ and XS ap- proached closely along tree limbs to slap at us with their fingers. FIG. 12. Principal travel routes and activity areas of Group H at Cayo Santiago before July 1966. stared at us from tree limbs. They often sneaked to within 1 m of our heads to stare intensely and perhaps to touch us. At other times they displayed exaggerated threats which incited other group mem- bers to threaten us also. Adults showed no concern about immatures approaching us unless the immatures became frightened. Individuals that were especially aggres- sive to humans at all times, sometimes coming directly from some distance to threaten or hit at us, were JZ, NQ, R04, S17, XS, and 84. Females 84 and JZ threat- Routine Daily Activities The general daily routine of Group H's activities conformed with Koford's (1963) overview of rhesus monkey social behavior at Cayo Santiago and with descriptions of activities written by Draper (1966), Fisler (1967), and Vessey (1968). H's activities were concentrated in the areas shown in Fig. 12. Feeding and drinking:-The schedule for distributing the monkey chow structured the daily behavior of all groups on Cayo Santiago. On feeding days, Monday, Wed- nesday, and Friday, groups awaited the arrival of chow from the mainland by con- gregating near the boat landing, the work- shop building where chow sacks were opened, and the feeding stations. All moved about and vocalized constantly. Groups followed workers distributing chow and competed for possession of feeders. Groups fought much, especially on Mon- day after the longer between-feeding in- terval over the weekend. Dominant groups fed first while sub- ordinate groups moved from feeder to feeder seeking admission. By mid or late morning most monkeys had fed and gone to rest, but the smallest groups might not finish feeding until afternoon. On Tues- days, Thursdays, and weekends, the groups continued to rest, move about, and seek natural food which included the flowers, fruits, leaves, bark, and twigs of coconut, uva de playa, roble, pendula, mangrove, caro, and several species of herbs. Group H's chow-getting time was dis- tributed proportionally between the feeders as follows: F2-42%, F3-20%, F6- 20%, F5-12%, F7-6%. Fl was non- functional and F4, on the small cay, was 28</page><page sequence="27">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel used solely by Group A. On feeding morn- ings, H usually awaited chow near F2 and S1. H fed immediately if undisturbed; but if C or E arrived, H retreated to the trees immediately south of F2 or to Sl and vicinity to await an opportunity to reenter F2, or they sought chow at another feeder. If A, C, or E got most of the chow first, H had to visit several feeders to get sufficient food. On several occasions H divided into 2 parts which were at 2 feeders simul- taneously. Most frequently, this dual occupancy included combinations of F2 and F3, F2 and F6, or F3 and F7. In some periods, H held a feeder for 2 hr, in others they were displaced within 5 min. The average period lasted 31 min. During the longer periods, chow getting was leisurely and group members pursued various activities besides getting chow. They dispersed around the feeder over an area 25-50 m in diam, averaging 30 m, and individuals or small parties were 1-2 m or more apart. Between trips to the feeder they rested, groomed, drank, nursed, explored, and fought with monkeys from other groups trying to enter the feeder. Immatures played vigorously. Feeding was especially relaxed and prolonged in the latter part of the morning or in early after- noon after dominant groups had fed and were resting and no longer bothering H. When dominant groups prevented H from entering a feeder, H's response ap- parently depend on the intensity of hunger among its members. When they had gone without chow for several days, they re- mained as close to the feeder as permitted by the dominant group. They moved about restlessly, changed positions often in the trees and on the ground, vocalized fre- quently with a hooting call typical of feeding interest, and watched intently the group possessing the feeder. Although wary of threats from the dominant monkeys, H was not easily chased away, and H mon- keys periodically rushed in for a quick grab of chow then retreated under pursuit. If attacked mildly, H moved a short distance from the feeder and then returned im- mediately, perhaps shifting to another side of the feeder area. In many instances only a part of Group H was involved in the conflict; the others remained close to the feeder. If driven off forcefully, the group ran to another feeder and either entered it or began circling about nearby. When not especially hungry, Group H was more relaxed while awaiting an op- portunity to enter a feeder. H monkeys groomed, played, rested, and showed little interest in the dominant group holding the feeder. They dissociated around a feeder area rather than crowding in closely to- gether, and some members often went to another feeder, dividing the group into 2 parties. H continued this behavior through- out the morning, occasionally getting some chow at first one feeder then another, seldom appearing alarmed and often avoid- ing dominant groups with a minimum of aggressive interaction. They rested fre- quently between feeders and remained much in open areas. Hierarchical rank within Group H was especially evident at feeding time. When male 132 had the feeder all others entered under the risk of his attack. He occasionally tolerated BC or a dominant female in the feeder, or an estrous female in consort with him. BC and Sll also fed singly in most instances, but permitted others to feed near them more often than did 132. The domi- nant males selected chow deliberately, picking the choicest bits, and often held the feeder through much of the feeding period. When a dominant male gave up the feeder, a great rush of females and young swept in. Dominant females and their offspring took precedence while ex- cluding subordinate monkeys or pushing them away from the best positions at the feeders. Peripheral males entered last, after others had finished and moved away. After filling its cheek pouches with chow, a monkey usually took it outside the feeder to eat it slowly or perhaps to soak it in a water fountain. Subdominant and immature animals kept away from domi- nant monkeys who might take chow from 29</page><page sequence="28">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS ..... . ? .., FIG. 13. Immature members of Group H drinking at the F6 fountain unhindered by dominant Male 132 sitting nearby, May 1966. them. Members of a genealogy often re- mained together, especially adult females and their infants. The availability of monkey chow did not deter Group H from utilizing natural foods. Subadult and juvenile animals, especially, ate much vegetation, possibly because they were unable to get sufficient chow. Natural food may also have been desirable for gustatory variety. On nonfeeding days, the feeders became empty and monkeys sought whatever vegetation was attractive. During these periods the adults and sub- adults often spread out widely over the ground and in trees. A variety of activities might proceed, and several kinds of natural foods be eaten by different individuals or subgroups. Infants and yearlings remained close to their mothers, but other immatures roamed widely in search of food or at play. Drinking water was available in rain pools and on wet leaves during much of the year, but during the dry season artificial fountains were major drinking places (Fig. 13). Water was available also from a few hollow tree trunks. The dominance hier- archy was demonstrated at fountains and tree holes; subordinates gave way to domi- nants or were shoved aside. Resting:-By 10-11 AM each day, the group began a series of resting periods in favored areas. Rest continued through the afternoon, occasionally disrupted by domi- nant groups or by unexplainable moves to new resting areas, until another period of general feeding or moving about occurred late in the day. Members nursed, groomed, explored, and played more during rest periods than at other times. A few mon- keys continued returning to a feeder for more chow. Juveniles played or explored. Adults groomed or slept with relatives or favored companions. Occasionally a fight 30</page><page sequence="29">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel FIG. 14. Group H resting in open forest east of Bi, Cayo Santiago. Male 132 faces camera in back- ground, center, June 1966. erupted. When food was scant, rests were briefer and less relaxed. Resting areas used most commonly by H were elevated places such as Fig Rock, Cl, the Laboratory, and a breeze-swept slope covered with an open forest north of Fig Rock. Other favored areas were B1, open forest to the east of Bl (Fig. 14), and the crest of the island near Dos Corchos. The group frequently rested on the west side of the island near Fl, on the Cross Trail, or in a rocky area west of the Laboratory and south of Sl. Some resting occurred at feeding stations, in the mangrove trees along North Trail, in the workshop area, and along the shore south- east of F3. Rest periods averaged 40 min in length. If H was restless or if it was disturbed by a dominant group, periods lasted 10-20 min. Other rest periods lasted up to 2 hr. Group members dispersed widely in the favored areas north of F6 and in the B1- Dos Corchos area. They spread over an area averaging 45 m in diam if circular or 15 x 55 m if rectangular. They occasionally occupied a site 70-75 m across. Individuals were on the ground or in trees and evinced no concern at being in the open unless a dominant group approached them directly. Moving:-A peculiarity of long, relaxed rests was a tendency for the group to move slowly by a "leapfrogging" process of individuals periodically moving 1-10 m to settle down again in a new location. All made these short moves in the same direc- tion, first one monkey and then another. We could see no reason for such moves. They occurred in the absence of other groups and when undisturbed by humans, and were unaccompanied by overt indica- tions of response to external stimuli. When an adult female made such a move, her off- spring and descendants tended to follow, 31</page><page sequence="30">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS FIG. 15. Four members of Group H on trail south of F3, Cayo Santiago, June 1966. They often hid in the dense trailside shrubs. a few at a time, and settle near her. These moves occurred anywhere; they seemed without goal and followed no particular route, but they always proceeded in the same direction. The group occasionally arose from an apparently undisturbed rest and moved deliberately, without digressing into other activities en route, to a new location 50-100 m away and there resumed its activities of sleeping, playing, grooming, exploring, etc. It appeared unalarmed before, during, and after the move, but may have been reacting to the approach of a dominant group not perceived by us. Other moves of H were mostly between feeders, between feeders and rest areas, or between any location and a refuge or escape area. When attacked strongly by a dominant group, H closed ranks immedi- ately into a compact mass &lt; 15 m in diam and ran to the nearest escape cover. As they proceeded, H monkeys began to spread out along the line of travel with the more aggressive adults alternately running and standing to fight a rearguard battle with the pursuers while the younger mem- bers rushed ahead. These moves often terminated before reaching the most re- mote or dense escape covers because the pursuers stopped or were driven away, and H promptly resumed routine activity. Adult males often returned to the rear of the group as if to round up stragglers. Members of Group H moved openly along the major trails (Fig. 15) between feeders or between feeders and rest areas. If not intensely hungry, they moved slowly and spread apart while seeking an unoc- cupied feeder. Infants played or made side trips to explore and adults stopped to rest or groom. If repulsed continuously by dominant groups or if feeders were empty, H consolidated more compactly and moved oftener, faster, and more deliberately be- tween feeders. Although the slow, aimless movement of the resting group seemed unorganized and leaderless, other moves were initiated and directed by dominant adults. Sometimes Male 132 led, but BC was the leader most frequently. Female CU initiated many moves by calling hoarsely and moving away from the group. Adult males and dominant females tended to take the lead, subadult males and juveniles the rear. The line of march was changed if hostile mon- keys were encountered. Infrequently, the whole group appeared undecided about a destination and milled about. This often occurred in the coconut plantation after visiting all nearby feeders and finding them occupied by dominant groups. On a few occasions, H was scattered widely while resting or moving slowly when suddenly without noticeable leader- ship or communication members gathered at one place and commenced seemingly organized direct, cohesive group action, such as feeding at a chow station. The average duration of a move was 13 min. More deliberate moves, as when 32</page><page sequence="31">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel seeking an unoccupied feeder, lasted about 4 min. During these moves, group arrange- ment became linear, with members spread out in an area 8 x 75 m. During the leisurely moves, in which individuals di- gressed into other activities along the way, the group spread into a circular array averaging 33 m in diam, ranging up to about 70 m across. Behavior During the Period of Trapping Several weeks before trapping the mon- keys for Desecheo, we constructed at Cayo Santiago a large cage, 21 x 7 m and 2 m in height, to be used initially as a trap and later as a holding pen for the Desecheo colonists. Before commencing to trap the group, we baited H members into the open pen with bananas to familiarize them with it and to facilitate their acceptance of our presence. Several adult males and domi- nant females took bananas from our hands and the overall flight distance was &lt; 3 m. Within 3 days after trapping commenced on 26 June, we captured one-half of H, mostly adults and infants, in the holding pen and in F2 and F3. Uncaptured H monkeys then became extremely wary and reluctant to enter the traps, and if bolder individuals approached a trap, Male 132 chased them from it. Flight distance in- creased to &gt; 20 m and members avoided us by keeping to dense cover and remote locations. We captured another 13 mon- keys, principally immatures and subadults, by the fifth day of effort. By the time trapping was completed, the 56 monkeys in the holding pen were at- tacking each other under the stress of confinement. Even close relatives attacked each other. Male Sll, usually a placid animal, wounded KP, JZ, and CE, before we could isolate him in a separate cage. KP's right arm was so severely lacerated that he was released. The slightest dis- turbance precipitated fighting in the hold- ing cage and almost every monkey except the infants incurred minor wounds. Mon- keys from other groups, especially E and C, reached through the wire to grab a limb or the tail of an H monkey, pull it through the wire, and bite it. H monkeys fought viciously among themselves for possession of favored perching places in the cage corners and on large tree limbs placed in the cage. On the afternoon of the fifth day, we took the monkeys from the cage and placed them in individual boxes for shipment. All became highly agitated while being netted or chased from the pen through a small exit into boxes. Several females abandoned their infants which normally are held close to the mother's breast. Later, these infants were returned to their mothers in the ship- ping boxes. The mothers at first ignored them or pushed them away, but soon ac- cepted them. Despite the numerous small wounds, no monkey died or became in- capacitated. All became quiet in the shipping boxes and remained quiet during the trip to Desecheo on the sixth day. Behavior of Monkeys Remaining on Cayo Santiago, 1966-1967 Intergroup Relations After staying 8 days with the H monkeys at Desecheo to observe their initial en- counter with their new environment, we resumed work on 11 July with the members of H remaining on Cayo Santiago. H had become similar in number to I (26 mem- bers) and J (24 members), but different from these groups in the proportion of members in different age and sex cate- gories. Each of these groups was approxi- mately half the size of F (58 members). From 11 to 21 July, H monkeys reacted with other groups similarly to how they had before losing the Desecheo colonists. Male BC had become the top-ranking member of H. KP, his arm healing well, was second in rank and active in conflicts with other groups. On 12 July, BC and KP by themselves chased all of I from F6 and kept them in retreat for a distance of 100 m. Group H's status began to decline by 22 July when I displaced the adult females and several immatures of H from a feeder. 33</page><page sequence="32">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS BC and KP were absent during this en- counter and did not return to assist the females. I continued to dominate H in all subsequent encounters that we observed. H continued to dominate F for 31 days postdivision. On 1 August, F was getting chow from a feeder and resting nearby. H arrived and promptly drove the F monkeys from the feeder. These F monkeys were joined by others and soon retook the feeder. During the next 40 min H re- peatedly attacked F monkeys at the feeder, driving them 5-6 m away, then retreating as increasing numbers of F monkeys counterattacked. Each attack became harsher until finally all of F charged en masse with extremely loud vocalization and chased H about 100 m. H was subordinate to F thereafter. Although J contained 4 adult males each older than 6 years and seemingly as large and aggressive as BC and KP, J did not achieve dominance over H until 2 Septem- ber, when it displaced H twice from a feeder. In each fight, J pushed H over the bluff and onto the cliffs on the east side of Cayo Grande. J's victory may have been possible only because KP received an in- capacitating wound in his right foot on 22 August and was unable to assist BC in defending the group for several weeks afterward. Even after KP recovered, J remained dominant to H in all subsequent encounters. After H fell to the bottom of the domi- nance hierarchy, it did not immediately change its attitudes to the other groups. From June through September, H main- tained its prefission routine of daily activi- ties although the frequency of its conflicts with other groups increased. The group rested overtly in open areas and travelled over all parts of Cayo Grande as before; it moved casually and ignored other groups unless threatened or attacked by them. H still competed for possession of feeders, but was increasingly unsuccessful as its hierarchical standing declined. During October and November, H mon- keys gradually lost the boldness formerly exhibited to other groups, and they became increasingly furtive and aloof. When not in hiding, they were harassed almost con- stantly by other monkeys. As a result, they began to stay longer in dense cover (Fig. 15) and secluded places. Between January and June 1967, we occasionally could not find H for 2 or 3 consecutive days. During one 13-day interval, we could locate H monkeys only in dense cover, and were unable to observe all members effectively; consequentiy, our analysis of postfission feeding, resting, and moving is based on comparatively fewer and more irregular observations than before July 1966. Intragroup Relations After we removed the monkeys for Desecheo, the members of H remaining on Cayo Santiago did not immediately change in their general characteristics, and they maintained the same positions in the intra- group dominance hierarchy that they had occupied earlier. By 11 August, BC had become the dominant male, although he lacked the mastery of the group formerly held by 132. Adult females continued to band together to resist his attacks on them or on their offspring. KP became second- ranking male and more active in attacking members of H and in defense against other groups. He was bolder toward BC, and they acted together in many activities, especially group defense. KP became more aggressive to females, but they resisted him and were defended by BC. NE became less peripheral and often stayed within the group. He often helped BC and KP fight other groups. By October, NE was vigor- ously attacking females 49 and AH. They had immediate assistance from BC, KP, and the dominant females who drove NE away. After 1 or 2 days of peripheral iso- lation, NE returned to adult company. Although KP still retained his position as second-ranking male when observations ended in June 1967, 11 months after fission, he twice lost status while recuperating from severe wounds during the intervals of 23 August to 19 September 1966 and 3 34</page><page sequence="33">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel October 1966 to 31 January 1967. In both instances, he had crippling leg and foot wounds, which caused him to limp and hold 1 foot off the ground. While incapac- itated, he became extremely subordinate to BC, cringing and grimacing before him, and he remained aloof from the others except to groom occasionally, usually with NE or immatures. He spent more time in trees, and avoided participation in either intra- or intergroup fighting. After his wounds healed, KP became bolder again with BC and rejoined group activities ex- cept that after March 1967 he continued to avoid intergroup fights, leaving BC to defend the group with some assistance from NE and adult females, especially S17. S17 and 84 dominated the other females, and S17 still focused her attacks on 97. Members of the remaining genealogies maintained their close intragenealogical associations. Adult females maintained the same associations with each other, with im- matures, and with adult males that they did prefissionally. We saw no lessening of the solicitous maternal behavior toward infants or of the protecting and disciplining of immatures. The most striking postfission change in social affiliations was that immatures whose relatives had gone to Desecheo banded together almost constantly in all activities. These monkeys were all yearlings and included Males D2 and D4 and Fe- males B9 and H9. B9 and H9 were cousins. D2 had a 4-year-old brother, castrated Male NQ. They groomed, fed, and played together. XD, an ovariectomied 4-year-old female, was D4's aunt, but they associated infrequently. The orphans associated often with KP, and occasionally were groomed by an adult female. They associated with other immatures, in play, but when the others returned to their relatives, the orphans remained together. The large Males BC, KP, and NE oc- casionally played and groomed with the orphans and other immatures (Fig. 16). BC, ZO, and NO wrestled and mock-bit FIG. 16. Adult male, upright in center, playing with juveniles, Cayo Santiago, June 1966. each other in what appeared to be simu- lated fighting. BC was never observed to do this before fission. Castrated Male NQ and his brother D2 were together often until late September. At that time D2 began to associate more with the other orphans and NQ became increasingly solitary and finally in October he moved to Group A. He rejoined H several times in November and December and stayed close to D2 for 1 or 2 days each time. His visits were fewer in 1967, and by March he no longer returned to H. While in A, NQ's constant companion was another 4-year-old castrated male who had moved to A from E. By late November, the immature mem- bers of H seldom engaged in the rough- and-tumble play that occurred almost con- stantly in the prefission period. Immatures played briefly and mildly when the group was hiding or resting in dense cover. They no longer played at all when the group was moving or trying to enter a feeder. The decline in play coincided with the 35</page><page sequence="34">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS general loss of boldness and increased ap- prehension in H apparently resulting from the frequent aggression from other groups. By April 1967, intragroup strife had in- creased markedly. Little provocation was necessary to elicit savage attacks which often involved much of the group before ending. This tension persisted thereafter, and was accompanied by a marked increase in the incidence of wounding. KP and BC had new wounds almost weekly after late September 1966. Reactions to Other Kinds of Animals The reactions of Group H to other animals and humans remained unchanged until November 1966 after which they ignored land crabs, rats, and lizards, and were difficult to approach for observations. They were particularly fearful of people at feeding stations and in open areas such as the coconut plantation. In dense cover, they moved away from our approach more readily than in previous times. Before fission, we could usually enter the group directly with little reaction from the mem- bers unless an infant was frightened or S17 became alarmed. After November, we had to approach the group more indirectly and slowly to get within 5 m of any in- dividual. In dense cover they moved away rapidly several times from our initial approach each day then gradually moved less and let us come close. The group was especially difficult to approach after it had been attacked by another group and was hiding in heavy vegetation. After play diminished among the im- matures, they also ceased the formerly common activity of threatening humans from tree limbs. NQ, however, became more aggressive to us prior to joining Group A. He stayed near us, and he frequently crept close to pluck our clothing or to threaten us. Female S17 was highly aggressive to people throughout the study. When we approached the group, S17 was commonly the first to threaten us and alert the others; 4 or 5 times a week she rushed at someone and struck him with her hand. Despite the increased apprehension toward humans, the adult members of H unhesitatingly came to threaten us if we frightened an immature animal. This in- cluded AH who was even shyer and more difficult to approach than before fission. Routine Daily Activities Feeding and Drinking:-The original chow distribution schedule continued unaltered after the Desecheo monkeys were taken away, and H's prefission routine of seeking food and water on Cayo Santiago con- tinued until late August 1966, when its members began to have difficulty in ob- taining and holding a feeder or a fountain. This difficulty intensified during Septem- ber and October, and by November, H was unable to retain a feeder if a few adults or a small band of immatures from another group opposed it. After November, H's overall feeding behavior was changed in several ways. On feeding days, H monkeys no longer awaited chow delivery to the feeding stations by sitting in open areas nearby, and they did not follow the work- ers carrying chow. Instead they hid in the dense thickets of bushes and trees, princi- pally at the south end of the coconut plan- tation or south of Sl, and from these points they ranged out to attempt entry into nearby feeders. The members became intensely preoccupied with feeding station activities as the morning progressed. For- merly they awaited entry to a feeder by moving about near it while occupying themselves with various interests and hoot- ing at the group holding the feeder. Now they gathered closely in a compact group of 15 m diam and appeared tense and irritable. They were frequently in the trees and remained silent except to respond to intragroup aggression. During the increas- ing tension of these long waits, intragroup strife intensified. As time passed each day, H tried more frequently to press in to a feeder whenever the group in possession relaxed its chow getting. H monkeys ran in to grab as 36</page><page sequence="35">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel much chow as possible before being re- pulsed. Their intragroup dominance hier- archy was no longer demonstrated in an order of feeding priority; all rushed in as best they could, then ran back to the trees to eat whatever they had succeeded in getting. They were commonly chased from the feeder area after a few such rushes, whereupon they reentered the pro- tective cover of nearby bushes and went to another feeder to try again to get chow. On some days they rushed from feeder to feeder in a close-packed mob under con- stant harassment from other groups. They were difficult to follow and observe during such periods. Occasionally, H took ad- vantage of the confusion when 2 other groups were fighting for a feeder by running in to grab chow hurriedly until evicted by the winner of the battle. Being unable to get enough food during the morning, H monkeys were usually still seeking a feeder in the afternoon of a feeding day. Before fission they held feeders for 0.5 hr, on the average, some- times retaining control for 2 hr. After fission, they could get no more than 5 min at a feeder before being evicted while other groups were still feeding in the morning, but after the others had fed and settled down to rest, H could hold a feeder up to 1 hr, averaging 26 min. Members spread out to a diameter of 20-30 m. By the time H members could enter a feeder, the chow was often exhausted; con- sequently, they ate more natural food. The playtime of juveniles and the resting time of members of all ages diminished greatly as they devoted more time to seeking edible fruits, seeds, and leaves. The proportion of H's actual feeding time at each chow station changed too. The proportion of time at F2 decreased from 42 to 24% of total feeding time. Time at F7 increased from 6% prefission to 11% postfission, and at F6 it increased from 20 to 36%. The proportion of time at F3 was 18% and at F5 was 11%, which were virtually unchanged from prefission ratios. The increase at F7 occurred solely from FIG. 17. Principal travel routes and activity areas of Group H at Cayo Santiago after December 1966. July through December. Apparently this was in compensation for time lost at F2 where they were being evicted with greater frequency. After December, H quit going to F7 entirely, probably because it was far from its most commonly used hiding areas at the south end of the coconut plantation and in the dense cover west of Dos Corchos. H then made greatest use of F3, F5, and F6. The extent of H's activities became reduced to the area shown in Fig. 17. H monkeys also had greater difficulty in getting to a drinking fountain after No- vember. During periods of rain, they had little trouble finding water, but during dry periods they often sneaked up the bluff on 37</page><page sequence="36">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS the east side of Cayo Grande to drink at F6 fountain (Fig. 13) which was close to the edge of the bluff and approximately 15 m east of the feeding station. If another group was at the feeder, it was less apt to attack H at this fountain than at other sta- tions where the fountain was adjacent to the feeder. If the other groups did attack H at the F6 fountain, H could retreat im- mediately over the bluff and elude the attackers. Resting:-Before fission, H had a daily rest period that extended from about 10 or 11 AM to 4 or 5 PM. It also rested while waiting to get a feeder or while possessing a feeder for &gt; 30 min. After H became subordinate to all other groups and was unable to get chow readily, its daily resting schedule was difficult to analyze. The feed- ing period extended into the afternoon, which reduced the available resting time. Occasionally, H attempted to rest in the Latrine-Laboratory-Fig Rock-Laboratory Point area while moving back and forth between F2, F3, and F6 to check the avail- ability of these stations. Other groups soon displaced it and chased it into hiding. Dur- ing the afternoon rest period, H monkeys went into secluded, densely vegetated areas where it was difficult to ascertain whether they were actually resting or were gather- ing natural food. After December 1966, H seldom made its afternoon rest in the locations it favored during the prefission period. Formerly it rested most often in open, breeze-swept locations on the east side or north end of Cayo Grande, but rested anywhere on the west side if displaced from the east by A, C, or E monkeys. After fission, H rested mostly on the bluffs along the east side of Cayo Grande, in dense vegetation just west of Dos Corchos, and in thornbush thickets at the south end of the coconut plantation. Less-used areas were sea grape thickets south of F3, shrub-covered rocks west of the laboratory and south of SI, the south end of Cayo Grande from Cliff Point to Southeast Point, and the crest of Cayo Grande near BI and Dos Corchos. H could not be viewed effectively on the eastern bluff, and its rests were observed princi- pally near Dos Corchos, Bi, and the coconut plantation. Rest periods averaged 35 min in dur- ation, only 7 min less than the prefission average, but there were fewer daily rest periods because H devoted much of the afternoon to intensively seeking chow or natural foods. A rest seldom lasted more than 60 min during which H slept and groomed less than before fission. H's dis- persion during rests was 22 m in diam or 15 x 35 m rectangularly, a much smaller area than before fission. Reduced dis- persion was due to less distance between members as well as to smaller group size. If undisturbed for long periods in dense vegetation, the members spread out to about 40 m diam seeking food. Members of Group H continued to groom each other in rest periods, but play and exploration by the immatures di- minished to sporadic incidents. The 3 adult males patrolled infrequently outside the group periphery. Parties did not leave the main band to visit feeders. Rests were interrupted, even in the densest cover, by roving bands of males from C and E. H resisted if only 2 or 3 of these males at- tacked, but otherwise it ran to another hiding place. Moving:-After H's fall in the intergroup dominance hierarchy, it lost its former spontaneity, variability of group structure, and relaxed attitude in moving about the island. H ceased moving in slow, unidirec- tional "leapfrog" travels over wide areas while resting, and no longer shifted periodically, for no apparent reason, from one resting place to another. H ultimately evinced only 2 kinds of travel. The most common was a hurried, purposeful, direct rush to escape aggression or to travel be- tween feeders in the persistent efforts to get chow. H maintained a close-packed group structure in these moves. When pur- sued by other groups, H condensed to 10- 12 m diam. Moves lasted &lt;4 min if H 38</page><page sequence="37">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel was attacked by 1 or 2 adults from another group; within that time H escaped and hid. If harassed strongly and continuously in a succession of attacks that pushed it from attempts to hide and prevented it from settling down, H moved for an average of 16 min until finally escaping. Moves between feeders were &lt; 4 min duration unless H paused in a hiding area to rest temporarily or to await the de- parture of another group. Group spread averaged 15 m and all members were con- stantly alert and frequently apprehensive as they watched for other groups. H no longer tarried in these moves as it did before fission when various other activities such as grooming, playing, exploring, and patrolling were common. If they paused, H monkeys sat together quietly but alertly, perhaps searching about quietly for edible material. H shunned the main trails and open areas. It moved through dense vege- tation as much as possible, often taking circuitous routes to keep hidden. The second kind of postfission move- ment occurred during resting periods in late afternoon. In these periods, H mon- keys milled about horizontally on the ground and vertically in the trees, alter- nately resting and searching for natural foods in the vegetation and ground litter. The relaxed and unidirectional "leapfrog" moves of prefission times were replaced by multidirectional activity within the limited confines of the resting area. The leadership of postfission moves was more distinctly effected by one individual than in prefission moves. BC appeared to initiate most postfission moves, and he threatened or attacked members who lagged behind or strayed from the line of march. Attacks were seldom necessary after January 1967, when all seemed fearful of leaving the group. BC customarily took the lead, and often appeared to scout the area ahead by going well in front of the main party. He often ran back to the group, faced the members, stood bipedally, then moved away quadrupedally in a new di- rection. Behavior on Cayo Santiago, 1968 We returned to Cayo Santiago to observe Group H 3-6 June 1968. This was insuffi- cient time for a detailed evaluation of H's current characteristics, but what we saw suggested that H had regained many of its prefission attributes. It was still at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy and was displaced frequently; nevertheless, it had regained much of its former boldness. At the time of this visit, H was in- fluenced by 3 major environmental changes that had occurred since our initial study period ended a year earlier. The first in- volved changes in group membership. In October 1967, second-ranking Male KP left H to join Group C, and a large adult male, R15, moved from E to H. We do not know whether these changes were coincidental and unrelated or whether KP was forced to leave H. Female 97 died in November 1967, and 49's yearling died in April 1968. Five infants were born in 1967 and 4 were born in 1968; 4 and 3 infants survived each year, respectively, bringing H to 32 mem- bers in mid-1968. The second change was that Cayo Santiago's total population had increased from 682 in 1966 to about 800 in 1968, &gt; 20 animals per acre. Much of this increase occurred in A and C, the largest groups present. Third, a severe drouth had persisted during the previous year (Fig. 18). Herbaceous ground cover had withered away completely, most trees had lost all or almost all of their leaves, fruits and seeds were scarce, and the dense thickets where H had taken refuge from other groups were too open to hide in. During the 4 days of our visit in 1968, we readily found and observed H. It was not skulking about in almost constant hid- ing as in 1967. It appeared relaxed and self-confident. H's most striking behavioral change was its defiance to other groups and resistance to displacement. H could displace small parties of adults belonging to other groups. The displaced animals sometimes returned with reinforcements to displace H, but H fought back and, even if defeated, it stayed in the vicinity rather 39</page><page sequence="38">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS 125 .J _J 100 z &lt;: ;.i L- o 75 (n LL z 0 25- 0 'i r 1 a i i 8 I I i l i l* l l l l l l l I ---- CAYO SANTIAGOX DESECHEO1 - - LA PARGUERA II I' -~~ \/ I I A AI \ I I I I\I / \ 1/ ' / I I I ^\ I 11 '~. : ~ I I I / ~ ~!

Although we en- countered H only on the east slope of Cayo Grande between F3 and the south tip of the island, which suggested that it did not use all parts of the island, it frequented open areas again in all vicinities. If at- tacked with great strength by a large party, H went over the bluff and onto the cliffs on the east side of Cayo Grande and then went rapidly either north or south to come up again at a distant location. In 1967, it would have remained on the cliffs for several hours before emerging. H's renewed aggressiveness is difficult to understand because it was competing with so many more monkeys than existed in 1966 and 1967. Fighting betwveen groups was more widespread and constant in 1968 than in previous years because of the intense rivalry for chow and water. Natural food was lacking; the average daily chow ration was reduced; and water was avail- able only at the feeding stations. Chow was distributed daily, instead of 3 times per week, which focused constant attention on the feeders. All groups seemed to spend less time in midday rest and were mainly committed to seeking chow. Dominant Groups A, C, and E controlled the feeders more rigorously, and smaller groups had greater difficulty obtaining one. The prob- lem was aggravated further by A raiding the feeders on Cayo Grande before return- ing to its private domain on Cayo Pequefio to consume at leisure the chow in F4. We could not learn when H had become open and bold in its actions again. J. Loy, a visiting scientist studying Group F, said that H had been displacing parties of F for several weeks and that for a time he -,,,1,,,1 ,, 1 | .... i'---I... 1_ _f I .... 1__ I ....I --- I 40 j_ .?</page><page sequence="39">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel believed H was dominant to F. Compared to its behavior in 1967, H was considerably more persistent in entering a feeder and taking its time to get chow, often doing so while other groups were fighting to possess the feeder. The displacements of H by other groups that we witnessed, how- ever, indicated that H was yet subordinate to them. We also witnessed situations where H and monkeys from 1 or 2 other groups were sharing a feeder. All were wary and each group threatened the other continuously. In some instances, several monkeys from 3 or 4 groups were at F6 simultaneously, all pushing and shoving to get chow, and thoroughly mixed together. Yet no serious fighting broke out among them. H's renewed aggressiveness probably re- flected a critical need for food and water. Its adult members had lost much body weight and appeared gaunt by comparison with members of high-ranking groups. Members of low-ranking Groups F, J, and I were also extremely thin. H's renewed boldness was undoubtedly facilitated by the addition of the new adult member, Male R15, and by NE having become an adult male and an effective fighter. BC, R15, and NE patrolled outside the group and fought together against other groups. R15 appeared equal to BC in size and dominance. No rivalry was evident be- tween them. They groomed each other and occasionally wrestled in playful attitudes. On 2 occasions, BC gave way to R15 at a feeder, but there was no sign of aggression from R15 and no subordinative behavior (grimacing or presenting) by BC, as was formerly the case between 132 and BC. We saw no fresh wounds on any group member. Although we did not have enough time to determine accurately the current hier- archical rankings of females, we were able to detect some general behavioral char- acteristics indicative of relative standing. Female HT had developed a more aggres- sive attitude; with S17 and 84, HT joined the males in group defense; AH and 49 did so infrequently. AH was as shy as in 1966; S17 was still the most aggressive female. As in previous times, she would occasionally go into a rage at another female or im- mature whereupon 84 would jump on her and clasp her tightly until S17 calmed down. The orphans were well integrated into the membership of H. NQ was still in Group A. Immatures had resumed playing again and threatening us from tree limbs with exaggerated aggressive postures and grimaces as in prefission times. We could approach closely to H without disturbing the members and stay with them for long periods and through numerous changes in location. Although H members were more pre- occupied with getting chow in 1968 than they were in 1967, they did not rush back and forth between feeders in a close- packed, apprehensive, harried pack as they had in 1967. They often demonstrated their original manner of spreading out around a feeder while watching and wait- ing for a chance to enter it, and in the meantime engaging in a variety of other activities. They dispersed up to 35 m in diam. The extent of time they actually held a feeder was variable throughout the day, but it averaged 16 min. They were highly vocal to other monkeys, and if dis- placed moved but a short distance away and stayed near the feeder no matter how often they were forced to move. Feeding was still done in disregard of the domi- nance hierarchy when in a rush to get chow, but when able to hold a feeder &gt; 5 min without disturbance from other groups, the more dominant individuals took precedence. During our visit, H monkeys were not seen at F2 or F7. Approximately 50% of their feeding time was at F6 and 25% each at F3 and F5. When not at a feeder, they usually were either at Fig Rock, Labora- tory Point, or open forest immediately north of the Laboratory. There they engaged in typical resting area occupa- tions: nursing, grooming, playing. They spread out over an average diam of 26 m 41</page><page sequence="40">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS for an average of 28 min. The adult males seemed closely attuned to the activities at F3 and F6 and apparently they could de- tect quickly the opportune moments to get chow because with no obvious signal they somehow got the entire group to move rapidly to an unoccupied feeder. If a few members of another group were still at the feeder, H ejected them. The ejectees oc- casionally returned with help to force H away, but H stayed near and finally took the feeder after the others moved on. F2 and F7 were constantly held by large num- bers of A or C monkeys; H apparently avoided them. H rested most often at Fig Rock adjacent to F6 where they were getting most of their chow and water. Group H did not enter its commonly used hiding place of 1967 west of Dos Corchos, but rested on the island crest around Dos Corchos, B1, and in open forest east of B1 much as it had in 1965- 1966. Here the members exhibited the slow, unidirectional, "leapfrog" movement again while resting. Moving was swift and direct when going to a feeder, but was not accompanied by the fear demonstrated in 1967. Not all members departed simultaneously in each move, and the group was sometimes 10 x 50 m in extent. When moving slowly and deliberately from one area to another, members dispersed over an area 40 m in diam and spent an average of 18 min en route. Individuals then paused to rest, groom, explore, play, etc., as in prefission moves, but were not forced by the domi- nant males to stay in a close group. Behavior of Monkeys on Desecheo Island, 1966-1967 Initial Response to the New Environment The larger part of Group H was flown to Desecheo Island on 1 July 1966. Adult and subadult females and immatures of both sexes were immediately put into a holding pen at the helicopter landing pad. Adult and subadult males were retained in their individual shipping boxes to prevent fighting, but the boxes were placed near the holding pen so that all monkeys could be liberated simultaneously to observe whether they would stay together as a coordinated group or would lose cohesion and scatter. All monkeys in the holding pen escaped shortly after entering it, and we could not locate them in the immedi- ate vicinity. We released the adult and subadult males on the next morning, and 2 observers followed them while 2 others searched for the females and immatures. The males stayed together and travelled rapidly north along the west shore to Corona del Norte, returned to Puerto Manglillo, then went eastward over the ridge into Long Valley (Fig. 5). The females and immatures had also stayed together and were resting and feeding on the east side of upper Long Valley. When the males entered the val- ley from the west, the females and im- matures apparently heard them and moved rapidly across Long Valley to them, and all were reunited amid intense vocalization. The group spent the remainder of the day resting and feeding while moving about slowly in upper Long Valley between Hill 140 and Hill 143. Male CE, who had been extremely sub- ordinate and peripheral at Cayo Santiago, did not accompany the other males when released. He was sighted intermittently at Radio Point from 1 to 4 July, and was never seen again. Physical Condition of Members The monkeys had experienced consider- able stress from capture and confinement during the week of trapping. Several were wounded from bites. Some had lost the companionship of relatives. Desecheo was a warmer, drier place which lacked the readily available water and chow to which the monkeys were long accustomed. Whether to search for food or to explore its new habitat, the group began making long, rapid marches over the rough terrain, commencing on day 3. These conditions probably were responsible for a rapid 42</page><page sequence="41">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel deterioration of physical condition, espe- cially in older adults. Monkeys on Cayo Santiago were ex- tremely well fleshed prior to July 1966. Some adult females were obese (Fig. 6). Healthy monkeys had sleek, thick fur. By the end of the first week on Desecheo, the monkeys appeared to have lost weight and their coats were dull and ragged. They appeared lethargic, haggard, and indif- ferent to each other. Many monkeys walked stiffly or favored wounded parts of their bodies. When resting between moves all seemed exhausted and discomfited by the heat. Injured monkeys slapped con- stantly at flies alighting on their wounds. The loss of weight persisted through October 1966, but most of the group be- came alert and vigorous again. This was especially true of immature monkeys, but most of the monkeys ran and climbed well and seemed less affected by the heat than they did in July. Old wounds had healed and new wounds were not evident. Male 132 and Females 57, 80, CU, and HE were extremely gaunt and less active than the others. By February 1967, many members seemed to have lost even more weight. Their arms and legs were emaciated and their abdomens swollen. Nevertheless, most were strong and very active. HM appeared to have lost less weight than others. Male 132 was still emaciated and had become stiff in his hips and legs. Females HE and 57 were in extremely poor condition, ap- pearing to have lost up to one-fourth of their original weight. They moved slowly and laboriously and their voices had hoarsened. Infants and yearlings were noticeably smaller in size than their age mates at Cayo Santiago. The pelages of all monkeys had improved but were yet thin- ner and less sleek than their original quality. During the remainder of the 1966-1968 period, all monkeys were thin, but im- matures regained sleek coats. Females 57 and HE remained extremely thin. Their health and vigor returned, nevertheless, so that all members seemed alert, strong, and apparently free from stress. The pelage of adults and subadults was always coarser than it had been before fission. No new wounds from fighting were seen. Minor wounds could have been inflicted and healed between our visits, but not one monkey showed new scars from large cuts. Dominance Hierarchy and Aggression Males:-From July 1966 to February 1967, the adult and subadult males retained the same hierarchical rankings held previously at Cayo Santiago. Male 132, however, did not enforce his supremacy as vigorously as before. His aggression involved little physical attack or abuse, and was of short duration. During the remainder of 1966, he occasionally displaced monkeys from food or water and threatened members for obscure reasons, but he seemed disinter- ested in them otherwise. He usually stayed with one or another party of adult females, sat in an attitude of deep fatigue and dis- interest in his companions or in distant group members, and seldom stopped the squabbles between other monkeys. Sll occasionally sat near 132 or groomed him, but 132 rarely demonstrated his dominance over Sll with subordinating mounts or attacks as he had formerly done to BC. Other monkeys were wary of 132, but they did not crouch or grimace at his approach. When 132 solicited grooming from another monkey, the solicitee often ran away with- out receiving the punishment that would have been given for such an act at Cayo Santiago. In February 1967, 132 was still in poor condition but seemed interested in group activities again and was more alert and forceful to others, although he still did not exert dominance as strongly as at Cayo Santiago. He occasionally broke up the mild fights between females or chased HM and JZ when they interfered with other monkeys. He took the communal water hole for himself when all went to drink, and when chow and fruit were pre- sented to consolidate members for census- ing, 132 kept all away until he had taken 43</page><page sequence="42">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS his fill. After February 1967, we did not see him again. During the first 3 days on Desecheo, Male Sll disappeared from the group for periods lasting several hours. When with the group he was listless and often aloof, but he groomed with the others. Females R02 and R04 groomed him while ignor- ing 132. Sll was unafraid of 132 and un- aggressive to others except when displacing subordinates from food or water. Sll dis- appeared on 4 July, not to be seen again until October when he was with the group and exhibiting greater aggressiveness and dominance than he had ever displayed be- fore. In October 1966, the highly dispersed group temporarily reunited into 2 parties; 132 accompanied one party and Sll trav- elled with the other. Eventually, the parties reunited, and 132 and Sll sat together while ignoring each other. Neither male controlled or directed the parties or the complete group. In February 1967, Sll behaved as domi- nantly as 132 to others, but he was still subordinate to 132. Both males threatened other monkeys but did not attack them as frequently or as strongly as at Cayo Santi- ago. In May and August 1967, Sll domi- nated whatever part of the group he was with, but he still did not control the mem- bers as strongly as 132 had done at Cayo Santiago. Sll permitted HM and NV to mount females in his presence, an act which 132 was never seen to tolerate. In May 1968, 2 distinct, separate groups ex- isted; Sll controlled one group and HM controlled the other. HM and JZ were still peripheral males in 1967, but they entered group activities more frequently than they had at Cayo Santiago. In February 1967, HM attacked females several times daily, usually rushing from a hiding place to grab and shake a victim. In May 1967, HM travelled one day with a party of females and young. No other adult males were present. HM occasionally attacked his companions in the manner of a peripheral male, rushing in from the sidelines to hit or shake another member, then retreating when females counterattacked together. In 1968, HM was unquestionably the dominant male of a new group, and he demonstrated the typical behavior of a controlling male. Male NV had always been extremely aggressive and was able to dominate mon- keys older than himself, presumably be- cause his mother, S17, was the dominant female and she supported him in fights with other monkeys. At Desecheo, he was as aggressive as ever to his subordinates, frequently displacing one or another from food or a resting place or attacking it for no obvious reason. NV still did not threaten Females R04, R02, CU, or 80. NV al- ways dominated HM in 1966 and 1967, but in 1968 HM was dominating one of the new groups while NV was subdominant to Sll in the other. JZ was peripheral to the group through 1967. In 1968, he was with Sl1's group, but his status was not evident. Females:-Hierarchical rankings were shown in displacements at food and water and in threat displays. Females R04 and 80 held equal rank at Cayo Santiago. During the first week on Desecheo, R04 emerged as the dominant female, whereas 80 became subordinate to her daughter LS. In the same period, Female 57 became subordi- nate to CM. The status of CU was even more unclear than at Cayo Santiago. She often kept apart from other females with the exception of her daughter IP. CU eventually became a close companion to HM and JZ after which IP was with her infrequently. CU, HM, and JZ were to- gether in many activities. They usually stayed at the group periphery or at the rear during moves. HM and CU occasion- ally chased JZ away although they were not in sexual consort. Female 80's geneal- ogy retained its standing despite her loss of rank. CM gained dominance over 57 although 4 years younger and no longer having the support of her mother, Fe- male 49. R04 was mildly aggressive to other fe- males in her new role as dominant female. She exerted her will through intimidation 44</page><page sequence="43">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel or overt threat and seldom attacked another female or immature. She was ag- gressive to NV, HM, and JZ when they interfered with other monkeys in her presence. She then assisted the others in chasing away the offending males. The loss of hierarchical rank by Females 57 and 80 was not accompanied by more severe aggression from other adult females. They were displaced from food or water by individuals formerly subordinate to them, but were not attacked. In February 1967, Female 57 was in extremely poor physical condition and unusually wary of other adults, although they did not molest her. In 1968 she re-entered group activi- ties. Intragroup aggression was considerably milder at Desecheo than at Cayo Santiago. There were few fights between geneal- ogies, and adult males did not make the vicious attacks on adult females that for- merly were especially frequent and severe during the mating season. HM, JZ, and NV made their customary harassments of females and immatures, but such attacks were mild and consisted more of threat or grabbing at a victim rather than physical punishment such as severe biting. Domi- nant monkeys threatened their subordinates and displaced them from food or water. Prolonged or violent battles between in- dividuals or genealogies were not observed. Aggression was- heightened temporarily during the few occasions of giving fruit or chow to consolidate a party of monkeys for censusing. In these cases, monkeys struck and pushed each other while com- peting for food, but did not attack strongly and bite. Noticeably absent was the screaming that accompanies competition over food at Cayo Santiago. Group Structure We had speculated whether the stress of being captured and moved to an unfamiliar environment would cause the monkeys to scatter in panic or whether they would gather closely together as when attacked by a more dominant group. Neither alter- native was true. The monkeys stayed to- gether when reunited on 2 July, but they were more widely dispersed than was habitual at Cayo Santiago. Adult females were 10-15 m apart. Immatures, especially orphans, wandered about individually with no apparent interest in other monkeys ex- cept to exchange hooting calls apparently sounded to maintain intragroup orienta- tion. The group was extremely inactive after reuniting on the first day. All mem- bers were listless and indifferent to each other. Although staying together, they were preoccupied with individual interests, and the coordination, discipline, and tension of enforcing dominance which formerly char- acterized the group were lacking. On 3 July, the second day together on Desecheo, relatives had drawn together, activities were becoming coordinated again, and all were more alert as they began making long marches and foraging for food. The increased group spread per- sisted throughout the first week. Individu- als and small parties separated widely while foraging, but rejoined when they stopped to rest during travel or when a heavy concentration of food was en- countered. The group frequently divided into 2 or 3 sections that temporarily drifted 35-50 m apart, although engaged in similar activities, but communicated by intensive vocalization. Sometimes one section be- came inexplicably alarmed and ran to join another. All united closely at dusk when preparing to ascend the trees selected for the night's sleep. At Cayo Santiago, Males 132 and BC had often forced members to bunch to- gether. At Desecheo, none of the dominant individuals attempted to control or limit the distribution of members. When spread- ing out, dissociation progressed initially by large parties, and finally by 3's, 2's, or individuals, often separated by 15-20 m. Partial regroupings and new separations recurred continuously as members ranged about, but through most of each day the group dissociated much more than it ever did at Cayo Santiago. 45</page><page sequence="44">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS In August 1966, dispersion had become greater. Adults were often &gt; 20 m apart, infants and immatures were ranging out individually &gt; 20 m from their mothers. Related monkeys banded together less fre- quently during the day, but the group re- mained intact, pursued goals in common, and maintained coordination with continu- ous vocalization. By October 1966, the group had de- veloped great flexibility of structure and function. On 10 October, one observer fol- lowed a party of approximately 35 monkeys from upper Long Valley into East Valley while the other observers found individuals and parties of 2 to 4 monkeys ranging in- dependently over the entire upper part of Long Valley. These members seemed not to be engaged in coordinated activity. Each monkey pursued its own interests, yet all communicated with frequent hooting calls that could be heard over the entire upper part of the valley. On 11 October, we found the group scattered over the lower southwest slope of Hill 208. Apparently disturbed by our attempts to approach them, the monkeys congregated into 2 parties which moved separately to lower Long Valley, reunited compactly for 30 min, then separated into small parties which returned in unison to upper Long Valley while spreading apart to forage as they moved slowly uphill. Elements of the group apparently acted together by com- mon consent rather than by coercion or direction from leaders. As in July and August, the typical group structure of Cayo Santiago was rarely exhibited. The observation period in February 1967 marked the last occasion in which we ob- tained an almost complete census and found the entire group sleeping together at night. At that time, nights were spent in lower West Valley near a good supply of drinking water in the rocks near Puerto de los Botes. After drinking at the pool each dawn, all moved uphill to feeding areas while separating into 2 or 3 inde- pendent parties. These parties spread out into smaller bunches which roamed over the upper slopes and ridges. Males 132 and Sll either accompanied a party or travelled alone; and if in a party, they did not direct travel or control the activities of other monkeys. The parties rejoined late in the day while all descended to the sleeping area. In May 1967, we found the group stay- ing in 2 parties, each roaming indepen- dently and sleeping wherever night found it. These main parties were not each con- trolled by a dominant male, and each party dispersed daily into smaller units while feeding. Members of parties became widely separated at times. We could not census each party thoroughly, but could determine its location by the calls of its members. One unit being followed down Long Valley divided at the valley mouth and one section turned to East Valley while the other went to West Valley. We were unable to determine whether the parties were permanently separate and had fixed membership or whether individuals or small units moved back and forth between them. In August 1967, a party of 33 to 36 monkeys, including 3 to 6 unmarked juve- niles, was again spending each night in lower West Valley. The rest of the group could not be found. Male 132 was still missing, leaving Sll as the only dominant male present. Other missing animals in- cluded HM, JZ, D5, 19, LS, and 57, 80, CQ, HE, and R02 plus their yearlings. Sll was not strongly dominant, but during rests, 12-15 monkeys gathered about him in an area &lt; 10 m in diam. At other times he was at the center of group activity. Group scatter often exceeded 150 m in diam; small clusters of 2-3 feeding mon- keys were separated by 20-30 m. We believe that by August 1967 2 or more independent social groups had evolved from the 2 parties seen in May. Male 132 was believed to be dead leaving Sll and HM as the probable leaders of the new groups. It appeared certain that at least 2 dis- tinctly permanent groups had developed 46</page><page sequence="45">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel TABLE 5.-GROUP MEMBERSHIP AND MISSING MONKEYS, MAY 1968, DESECHEO ISLAND.

Group 1, containing 20-25 monkeys (including 5 infants and an indeterminable number of unmarked im- matures), ranged the ridge bordering the west side of West Valley. An exact count was unobtainable because several un- marked immatures could not be distin- guished. These were the infants of 1966 and perhaps some yearlings born in 1967. Sll was the hesitant but effective dominant male in the group. Females CQ and R02, missing in August 1967, were now with Sll. Group spread was considerably less than among foraging parties in 1967, but it still exceeded group spread at Cayo Santi- ago. The members were often separated by &gt; 10 m. Five adult females were present and they were in an area &lt; 10 m in diam at times. Sll orientated toward them pro- tectively when approached by an observer. When NV came near, Sll made him cringe and grimace in submission. The overall ap- pearance and behavior of this group re- sembled the self-confident, leisurely Group H of 1965. Group 2, containing 17 monkeys (includ- ing 4 infants) and dominated by Male HM, ranged in lower Long Valley. Fe- males 57 and HE, missing in August 1967, were now in HM's group. HM behaved as a typical dominant male. When given monkey chow to consolidate the members and identify them, HM attempted to keep the others away and take the chow for himself. He threatened and pummeled them, but did not attack savagely with bites. They persisted in coming for chow despite his actions. Eighteen marked monkeys were un- accounted for in 1968. These included 132, and R04, 80, and the majorities of their genealogies. Although it was possible that 132 could have dominated these mon- keys in a third group, we believe that it was unlikely because intensive searching in the visits of May and August 1967, and in 1968, failed to reveal 132. It was more likely that the missing animals were dead or were with Sll's group but situated far enough from the main party to escape notice, possibly ranging out as independent foraging parties as in 1967. This belief was 47</page><page sequence="46">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS substantiated in 1969 when another group of investigators led by P. Warshall found most of these monkeys in Sli's group (Warshall, pers. comm.). Warshall could not find Females CQ, CU, LS, R02, and 80 or Males JZ and 132. With TE, WM and the majority of relatives of R04 and 80 in Sll's group, the more dominant male was with the largest group. In 1968, Fe- male CQ was the only individual definitely known to leave her relatives (57's geneal- ogy) to join another group. Behavioral Interactions Maternal Care and Play:-At Cayo Santi- ago, immature monkeys played frequently through the day. They wrestled, chased each other, played "hide and seek," swung on limbs or vines, and teased older mon- keys. Play bouts were vigorous, prolonged, and commonly involved 6-8 participants. At Desecheo, play occurred rarely and consisted of brief, half-hearted wrestling bouts between 2 individuals. During the first 3 days, the total absence of play un- doubtedly stemmed from the great amount of moving and the fatigue that afflicted all members. Afterward play was superseded by the intensive food seeking that preoc- cupied every individual regardless of age. We anticipated that play might eventually become common at dawn or at dusk when all were relaxed and showing mutual interest in each other at sleeping areas, but this did not happen. Only 4 instances of play among 1- and 2-year-old animals were observed in August 1967. Each bout lasted &lt; 1 min. In 1968, much play occurred among juveniles in Group 1, but no play was seen in Group 2. Juveniles I to 3 years old abandoned also the formerly common practice of joining together for explorations away from the group. Juveniles straying from the main body of the group at Desecheo were more likely to be alone or with relatives and were occupied with the search for food rather than with playful exploration. De- spite the absence of play or exploration, juveniles groomed each other occasionally. From the first day on Desecheo, adult females were uncharacteristically indiffer- ent to their infants, and within the first week infants achieved an independence and self-sufficiency that occurs nearer to 1 year of age at Cayo Santiago. In July 1966, infants were still young enough to warrant the solicitous maternal care normally given them during the first few months of life (Kaufmann 1966). Prior to our dividing the group, all mothers were preoccupied with intensive fondling, protecting, groom- ing, and disciplining of their infants. Fe- males remaining on Cayo Santiago con- tinued to show this deep concern, but females at Desecheo in 1966 showed little interest in their infants unless the infants were severely frightened by an older monkey. At Cayo Santiago infants stayed close by their mothers. They were allowed to nurse frequently, although eating much chow in June 1966, and while nursing were groomed and shown much solicitous atten- tion. When the group moved, mothers carried infants ventrally or assisted them to mount and ride dorsally, pausing to help them remount if they fell off. An infant frightened by another monkey screamed whereupon the mother or relatives came to protect it and incite other group members to attack the offender. During heavy rains an infant huddled close to its mother's breast while the mother bent forward and protected the infant with her body and arms. During the second and third days of July 1966 at Desecheo, long, rapid marches alternated with periods of moving slowly about in search of food each day. Our strongest impressions of mother-infant relations at that time were of infants running and crying while trying to keep up with their mothers during moves and of trying to nurse or climb onto the mothers during feeding periods. When the mothers paused to rest, the infants succeeded in cuddling and nursing and getting some attention such as grooming, but mothers 48</page><page sequence="47">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel seldom if ever initiated this activity. They carried their infants much less than before. The mothers were aloof, each seeming to merely tolerate its infant when with it and to ignore it when they were separated. Infants had difficulty in riding on their mothers during moves. The mothers offered little opportunity or assistance for infants to get on them, and the infants seemed to lack strength for staying on the mothers. When an infant fell off, its mother often continued walking without stopping to help the infant remount. An infant left behind cried and ran to catch up. The mother sometimes paused and looked back until the infant reached her, whereupon the mother set off at a rapid pace to join the other adults, leaving her infant to try to catch up again if it failed to get on her. During rainstorms, infants sometimes had to find shelter alone or with a monkey other than its mother. Incessant lost cries were sounded and many lone infants were seen running and stumbling over obstacles trying to reach their mothers who had moved out of sight. Regardless of the degree of fright ex- pressed by an infant, older monkeys, in- cluding the mothers, usually ignored it or showed only mild concern. The mother might approach sufficiently close to watch the infant for a moment then resume feed- ing or whatever activity she was occupied with. We did not see older monkeys molesting infants, but infants were startled by other monkeys, especially HM and JZ, and screamed in fright. The mother might come to get the infant and carry it away or walk beside it, possibly threatening nearby monkeys in passing, or chasing away the males. We saw many occasions of an infant commencing to nurse only to have its mother begin walking or climbing in disregard of the infant which then tried to retain the nipple but soon fell off unless able to get a secure hold on the mother's ventrum. After the third day on Desecheo, mothers and infants began adjusting to their new life, and they adopted a pattern of inter- action in which infants abandoned their intensive efforts to remain constantly with their mothers, and mothers displayed more interest in their infants when with them. During the previous month, at Cayo Santi- ago, infants were seldom &gt; 15 m from their mothers, and they did not stay apart more than a few minutes. Infants became oc- cupied intensively with food seeking after 3 days on Desecheo, and they were alone for several hours during which they sought food from the ground to the treetops and roamed &gt; 20-30 m away from other monkeys. When a long move was made, infants and other immatures each travelled at its own pace. They stopped to feed or rest at will, participated in the frequent vocalizing, and eventually rejoined their relatives at the next stop. Nursing became infrequent, although it was still common at Cayo Santiago, apparently because infants were eating more solid food, but infants nursed, were groomed, held, and cuddled by mothers and relatives during rests. In August 1966, infants were notice- ably smaller but were more self-sufficient and more active than their age mates at Cayo Santiago. Infants born on Desecheo became in- dependent of their mothers at a much younger age than did infants at Cayo Santiago. New infants were given intensive care and protection, being carried and nursed wherever the mother went, but at 1 to 2 months of age they were seldom restrained from roaming as are infants on Cayo Santiago. Infants observed in August 1967 were about 3 months old and ranged independently out to 20 m from their moth- ers without eliciting maternal response. Infants did not give lost calls, and if they screeched in fright their mothers either ignored them or went to them without showing the concern evidenced at Cayo Santiago. Mothers were not seen to carry infants at any time during this period, but it is possible they did so. In May 1968, infants were 1-5 weeks of age. A mother fondled and carried an infant when it was with her, but when an infant wandered 49</page><page sequence="48">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS away the mother seemed unconcerned and exhibited none of the apprehension with which mothers at Cayo Santiago restrained infants of this age from going more than 5 m away. Grooming:-In the prefission period, grooming accompanied all daytime activi- ties except intergroup fighting. The extent of grooming varied during moves and feed- ing periods, but at any instant we usually saw grooming between at least 2 or 3 pairs of adults or subadults plus several adult females and their immatures. Grooming was intensified during the prolonged rests, especially after the morning feeding period, and it often involved more than two-thirds of the group. During the first day on Desecheo, grooming bouts were desultory and brief. Grooming occurred chiefly between im- matures. The adults stayed apart, ignoring each other and the younger members. Through the remainder of the first week, grooming intensity reached prefission levels only when the entire group rested after a long rapid move or when it was united at a sleeping area. Long moves and food seeking were done intensively, as though the monkeys were compelled by a strong motivating force, and grooming was re- stricted to pauses taken by a few members at any one time. Wounds received just before leaving Cayo Santiago were licked by relatives or older companions. The grooming pattern established in July persisted in August, but by October grooming occurred more frequently and in longer bouts. The unified, coordinated group activity prevailing in July and August had changed to pursuit of inde- pendent goals by widespread small parties and individuals. Members appeared more relaxed, and they groomed as they desired instead of foregoing grooming to keep pace with the others or to compete for available food. The intensity of grooming rose sharply when several members gathered together. In February and May 1967, grooming was performed vigorously by all members when at a sleeping area. At any time dur- ing the day there were always some mon- keys grooming, maintaining a low but steady overall rate. Moving, resting, feed- ing, and grooming went on continuously among the parties we were able to watch. The midday rest accompanied by intensi- fied grooming so typical at Cayo Santiago did not recur at Desecheo. In August 1967, about 35 monkeys stayed as a group in lower West and Long valleys. They travelled slowly through these areas while feeding and resting much. Grooming was a major social activity in which some bouts lasted &gt; 30 min. Associations Between Individuals:-The strongest associations between individual monkeys continued to be those among close relatives. Exceptions were the immature and subadult offspring of Females S17, 49, and AH. NV had little to do with his sisters ZF and Cl. He became a companion to 132 and groomed him often but did not establish amicable relationships with other monkeys. ZF and Cl were together often or with the other orphans. In 1968, Cl was with HM's group while NV was with Sll. Brother and sister FZ and TE and their niece FE associated with each other and with their aunt CM and her offspring. The orphaned immatures associated much with each other but also had companionship with monkeys not related to them. HM and JZ were seldom apart, and in the first days on Desecheo HM frequently licked JZ's wounds. Sll always received closer attention and more grooming from adult females at Desecheo than did 132. Although 132 still dominated the group in July 1966, dominant Female R04 and Fe- male R02 groomed Sll more often than they groomed 132. CU frequently accompanied HM and JZ in 1966, at which time her daughter IP stayed away from her. CU also spent time with other adult females, seeming to be accepted equally well by all. CU had al- ways been independent in her associations 50</page><page sequence="49">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel with other adult females. She got along better with other monkeys than did any other adult in Group H. An incident hap- pened in August 1967 which, viewed anthropomorphically, suggested a feeling of affection toward CU by other monkeys. During the initial 2 days of the visit, most of the group was accounted for except CU, her 1966 infant, and her son ZS, who was then 3 years of age. CU and her offspring rejoined the party suddenly whereupon many of the members rushed to her amid loud vocalizing, and surrounded her, nuzzled her face, groomed her body, and sat close to her for prolonged periods. Reactions to Other Species Humans:-During the initial 2 days on Desecheo, we could approach to within 2 m of a monkey before it moved away. In retreating it moved slowly and without alarm 2-5 m then resumed its occupation while seeming indifferent to us. When a monkey looked in our direction, it seemed to stare beyond or through us as though we did not exist. If we remained motion- less, a monkey might approach to within 1-2 m and give no indication that it was aware of us. From 3 to 7 July, the members behaved as though they perceived us, but they seemed indifferent to our presence and even to our direct stares. If we stumbled in the undergrowth or dislodged rocks on the steep hillsides, one or more monkeys might cry in alarm and leap into trees or run a short distance and then ignore us again. Before fission, an alarm would excite others to come and behave aggres- sively to the person responsible. In the first week at Desecheo, the startled animals quickly recovered their composure while others ignored their outburst. Human voices amplified at high volume by the receivers of our two-way radios failed to evoke overt responses from monkeys nearby. In August 1966, their attitude was re- versed and all were more apprehensive of us than at any time prefission. On 5 August, they were uneasy with our ap- proach and would not let us come with 15 m. A direct stare at an individual elicited a grimace or threat. When we attempted to enter the group it kept moving away, going 5-30 m before settling down again. Eventually the flight distance decreased to 6-10 m and the group moved away with- out excitement or alarm. On 6 August 1966, we distributed a few oranges and afterward could enter the group and get within 3-6 m of individuals without their retreating. An individual separated from the group, however, showed fear or defensive threat and retreated when we approached within 10-15 m (an excep- tion was JZ who was unafraid of us). On the other hand, if an observer stood or sat quietly, a solitary monkey might forage within 2 m of him without showing con- cern. We found that widely dispersed, solitary monkeys or small parties were extremely difficult to approach in October 1966. They became alarmed when we came within 20 m and at 10-15 m they ran for considerable distances and could not be found again. HM and JZ came within 2 m to get chow but backed away 5-6 m to eat it. On one occasion after we had spent several hours trying to observe widespread parties, all monkeys gathered into a group in lower Long Valley and became easily ap- proached. We went within 1-3 m of mem- bers without causing alarm or retreat. Upon dispersing they became fearful again, and the flight distance increased to 15-25 m. In February 1967, monkeys came to us readily when we displayed chow or fruit or had a pack sack in which food was carried. They rushed in to take food from our hands and from the sack if permitted to do so. We could touch them or pull their tails at such times, eliciting grimaces or brief threats but not the severe reactions that would have occurred at Cayo Santi- ago. When all were dispersed and our food was not evident, the flight distance was 10-15 m again, although if we were quiet some animals came within 2-3 m. If we 51</page><page sequence="50">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS stared directly at a monkey while it ap- proached us or took food, it might grimace or threaten and retreat 3-4 m then quickly regain its composure and approach again. In May 1967, members dispersed in small parties or individually showed greater self- confidence and were less concerned with our presence than they had been in pre- vious visits. Flight distance was &lt; 8 m. During the visits of August 1967 and May 1968, all monkeys encountered were as approachable as in the prefission period. We could get within 2-5 m of an individual without causing a withdrawal. If we tried to get closer than 2 m, the monkey became wary but would not move far. The ap- parent absence of fear in these visits may have reflected the renewal of group con- solidation. In August 1967, the group surprised the observers by coming to them in the first encounter. All members except infants took chow from our hands. A simi- lar reunion occurred in 1968 when part of Sll's group suddenly appeared from the undergrowth to surround an unsuspecting observer. Sl1's group evinced more curi- osity than threat to the observer in 1968. Notably absent at Desecheo was the frequent harassment of people by bands of 1- to 3-year-old immatures which at Cayo Santiago made exaggerated threats from nearby tree limbs. Presumably a form of play, the participants often came within 1 m of the victim's head and occasionally touched him. Female XS was a leading practitioner of this behavior. She resumed it in May 1967, but other immatures did not join in. Immatures sat close by our heads when we handed out chow but they did not harass us. Nonhumans:-We saw no interactions be- tween monkeys and feral cats. On several occasions we found monkeys and goats within 15 m of each other, and they showed no apparent response to each other. We observed few instances of monkeys re- sponding to the abundant birds. In all visits we believed that monkeys avoided the seabird nesting areas because of the unpleasant odor from the bird droppings. The smell of guano was especially strong beneath the communal tree nests of red- footed boobies. We saw a booby land on a tree near 2 immature monkeys which were picking fruit. The monkeys ascended warily to the bird which eventually flapped its wings in their faces and departed while the frightened monkeys went to the ground in great haste. Pearly-eyed thrashers often startled monkeys by flying close by their heads. Monkeys were disinterested in land crabs and lizards. A new experience for them was being stung when bumping into wasp nests hanging from tree limbs. The victims screamed, rolled and threshed about, then ran to elude the wasps. At Cayo Santiago they seemed never to be annoyed by insects. In the first week at Desecheo, they slapped constantly at flies and gnats which tried to alight on their faces and wounds. In later visits the monkeys seemed unaffected by these in- sects. Routine Daily Activities At Cayo Santiago, feeding and resting occurred separately in a regular daily schedule: feeding at chow stations in the morning; resting at favored locations in the afternoon. Regardless of which activity prevailed, most of the group participated in it, although some individuals temporarily digressed into other activities. Group moves at Cayo Santiago were also distinct events and usually of short duration. Members moved rapidly in unison in a compact band when attacked or when eager to obtain a feeder, or they roved slowly while spread apart and occasionally pausing individually to investigate some- thing, groom, or rest. In either case, the move appeared to occur because of a desire to change locations rather than to provide an opportunity for engaging in other activ- ities while moving. At Desecheo, the daily schedule of these main occupations and the proportion of time devoted to each soon changed.

Circular travel route and activity areas, Desecheo Island, 1966-1971. absence of chow, foraging became the principal daily activity and travel became a constant facilitation of the search for food. Instead of the entire group taking a prolonged midday rest, individuals or small parties of monkeys periodically ceased foraging to rest or groom for a short time. Eventually feeding, resting, and moving became blended into a composite group occupation in which these activities per- sisted simultaneously and could not be measured as separate entities. They are described together here, as observed in each visit to Desecheo, but first are defined 3 types of travel employed by the monkeys. Rapid Travel:-The group often moved rapidly and purposefully as though headed for a distant goal. Travel speed in these moves averaged &gt;10 m/min, the pace being set by adults leading the way. Travel was mainly terrestrial, but many animals, especially immatures, proceeded through tree limbs wherever the overstory was sufficiently dense. A majority of the group began the move together and travelled in 53</page><page sequence="52">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS a column which lengthened as the move progressed. The more vigorous adults were in the lead; immatures and weaker adults lagged behind. When all members were in a single column the line measured 1-10 m wide and 75-100 m long. Occasionally 2 or 3 sections formed which became sepa- rated but continued along the same route to the final destination such as a water hole or new feeding place. The sections moved either parallel to each other (ca. 25 m apart) or one behind the other (25-100 m apart). Group coordination was high and little or no herding of strays was seen. Individuals or small parties stopped briefly to rest, groom, or feed, then hurried to catch up with the main group. Infants and weaker monkeys often straggled far be- hind and did not catch up until the group made a temporary rest stop or reached the final destination. Rapid travel occurred predominantly along valley bottoms, shore lines, and the main ridge of the island between Hills 140 and 208 (Figs. 5, 19). Side slopes were travelled more frequently than ridges. Slotv Travel:-All members moved slowly but steadily in the same direction while occupied individually or in parties with feeding, social interacting, or resting. Feeding was especially common. Average travel speed was &lt; 10 m per minute. Leadership was not clear and a final desti- nation was not evident although the mon- keys proceeded in a common direction. Each individual alternately moved and performed other activities such as eating fruit and leaves in the trees. When the members were scattered over a circular or oval area, group diameter ranged from as little as 20-50 m up to 150- 200 m. Dispersion increased when foraging was intensified; individuals became sepa- rated by 20-30 m. Moving and foraging slowly, the group often proceeded as a broad front rather than as a file or column. Random Movement:-The group, or sepa- rate parts of the group, stayed in a general area while circling and milling about with- out a mutual direction of travel. Individual moves were fewer and briefer than in slow travel. Foraging was prominent; resting, grooming, nursing, and some exploring oc- curred more frequently than in other kinds of movement. Group spread averaged as low as 20-30 m in diam when at a concen- tration of food or water or at a sleeping place, but through much of the day, ran- dom movement extended over an area &gt; 200 m in diam. In the sections that follow, the principal characteristics of activity observed during each visit are summarized to illustrate the trend of changes in group organization and daily routine. July 1966:-After the members were re- united in upper Long Valley on 2 July, they spent the remainder of the day alter- nately performing slow travel and random movement between Hills 140 and 143. All seemed extremely fatigued and rested often. They were indifferent to each other, groomed very little, but showed interest in their new surroundings by exam- ining potential foods. Although chow was their dietary main- stay at Cayo Santiago, members had con- siderable foraging experience which was put to use immediately at Desecheo. All monkeys, including infants, began sampling various materials and were soon eating a great variety of plants. Uva de playa, caro, and pendula had been common foods at Cayo Santiago. These familiar species were not selected in greater proportion than newly encountered plants. We saw no evidence that new foods were consistently tried first by any category of monkeys which set an example for other members to emulate. Drinking water was discovered in numerous large holes in the trunks of almacigo trees (Fig. 20), and, as at Cayo Santiago, monkeys reached into the holes and then licked the accumulated rainwater from their hands and forearms. On 3 and 4 July, the group travelled all day in rapid moves along the main path of 54</page><page sequence="53">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel FIG. 20. A young monkey, lower left, gets water from a hollow almacigo tree while others await to drink, July 1966. the circular route illustrated in Fig. 19. Each move lasted 2-3 hr, interrupted by occasional brief rest stops, and ended with a resting and feeding period lasting 60-90 min, in which slow or random movement persisted until another burst of prolonged, rapid travel proceeded along the circular route. The group did not veer from this route. Members ate whatever food was available along the way. They sometimes lingered briefly at better feeding sites then rushed on again. Resting and feeding periods did not occur regularly at the best food sup- plies, which suggested that such places were not the goals of rapid moves. Rapid travel decreased on 5 and 6 July while slow travel and random movement increased. All activities were still restricted to the circular route (Fig. 19), and the group spent increasing amounts of time in the higher areas near the ridge extending from Hill 140 around to Hill 208. This area held cool, breeze-swept resting places and better supplies of food. On 7 July, the group again stayed between Hills 140 and 143, moving randomly, resting, and feeding avidly through the day. Throughout the week all members had travelled among dense cactus stands, which were novel to them, with little trouble from cactus spines. Succulent vegetation was the main food. Basal portions of grass, sedge, weed stems, as well as berries, fruits, and new tree leaves, were eaten in great quantity. The seeds of grasses, sedges, and weeds pro- vided much food also, and a material com- monly eaten that seemed unusual as food was the bark and cambium of well- decayed, dead limbs of almacigo trees. Insects were eaten whenever encountered. Several monkeys demonstrated consider- able dexterity at catching flying insects, a skill we did not observe at Cayo Santiago. August 1966:-After the group had been on Desecheo for a month, its activities were still limited to the circular route (Fig. 19) from Long Valley westward, but the be- havior of the monkeys suggested that all were well acquainted with the area and were moving deliberately between chosen locations rather than rushing along without an apparent goal as in July. The preferred sleeping and feeding areas were along the upper slopes of Hills 140, 143, and 208 and the ridge connecting them, or in the lower ends of West Valley and Long Valley and on the south slope of Hill 104. The prolonged, seemingly goalless, rapid travel of July was largely replaced by con- tinuous slow travel accompanied by feed- ing and intermittent resting by individuals in August. Individuals were more dis- persed in August and the group occasion- ally formed a line 300 m long when travelling. Rapid travel occurred when the group appeared desirous of changing lo- cations quickly, especially when it moved abruptly between high and low elevations. Such moves usually took the group directly to a main feeding area or a favored sleep- 55</page><page sequence="54">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS ing place. Where food was most abundant, monkeys spent 1-2 hr in random movement and intensive feeding on the ground and in trees. In other places they moved steadily and slowly, as a group, and foraged for whatever edible material was available. Fruit and berries were at a peak of abun- dance in August, especially on the lower south slope of Hill 104 where the group spent much time. Grass seeds were scarce but great quantities of weed seeds were available in upper West and Long valleys. Monkeys ate greater quantities of the bark and cambium of dead almacigo limbs than in July. October 1966:-During most of this visit the monkeys were scattered in small, wide- spread, independent parties across upper Long Valley. Foraging was their major occupation. The same foods were taken as those in July and August. Parties moved slowly or randomly, each at its own pace and direction, stopping to feed, rest, or groom without regard to the activities of other parties. All frequently sounded a hooting call as though communicating with each other. Monkeys congregated into a single clus- ter on only 2 observed occasions, both of which resulted from our efforts to approach small parties. When monkeys were scat- tered far apart their flight distance increased markedly. If we persisted in try- ing to get close to them, individuals or small parties assembled into large parties then travelled rapidly to a distant location. February 1967:-During the visit we found a new pattern of daily activity. The entire group slept each night in lower West Val- ley. Shortly after dawn all drank from a deep rain pool near Puerto de los Botes then moved slowly uphill while breaking up into independent parties of various sizes. Parties went along the circular route west and north to Sego Can Ridge, over Hill 104 to the main crest or upper Long Valley, or across the lower south side of Hill 104 and along the route up Long Valley. Members moved slowly or ran- domly over the upper slopes and ridges of all 3 valleys and along the main crest of the island while feeding, resting, and grooming as they chose. In late afternoon the parties returned slowly to West Valley while foraging along the way. They drank again at the rain pool before ascending sleeping trees for the night. Throughout the day, parties sometimes became separated by several hundred meters, as when in different valleys or when some monkeys were on the island crest at Hill 143 or 208 while others were on the shore or in the lower end of a valley. They fed on the same kinds of materials eaten in 1966 with the addition of cactus fruit (Opuntia dilenii) which was most abundant on the higher slopes of Hill 208 and upper East Valley and attracted much attention from the monkeys. Weed seeds, almacigo fruit, and new almacigo leaves were favored also. Almacigo trees had dropped one-third to one-half of their mature leaves, being in the latter part of the winter dry season, and new leaves were developing. While dispersed, monkeys were furtive and elusive and ran from our approach. When congregated, they were unafraid and approached us to take chow. We did not see rapid, direct, en masse movement by the group. Travel was ac- complished slowly, and much random movement took place. Although movement often followed a part of the circular route, the monkeys did not adhere to it as rigidly as in July or August 1966. May 1967:-Severe drouth had withered the island, and all rain pools were dry. Many trees were defoliated; grasses and weeds were dry or dead. Dead land crabs lay in great numbers over the lower slopes and valley bottoms. Hermit crabs survived but were unusually inactive and confined to cavities under tree roots or the under- sides of fallen tree trunks where some moisture remained. The monkeys were in 2 parties when first 56</page><page sequence="55">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel encountered on 8 May. One party ranged between Hills 140 and 143, the other was on Hill 208. The members of both parties were scattered widely at their respective areas of activity and they vocalized inces- santly. All were unafraid of observers and could be approached to within 5 m. We approached the party on Hill 208 first and put out a small amount of chow to bring the members together to identify them. We moved on to Hill 143, and several members of the first party followed us and joined the monkeys at Hill 143 while the others stayed on Hill 208. All began moving randomly, however, until the entire group was scattered across the head of Long Valley from Hill 140 to Hill 208. Intense calling sounded throughout the areas, and monkeys moved about randomly while foraging, resting, and grooming. During the remainder of our visit, the 2 groups stayed apart from each other. All monkeys were intensely preoccupied with feeding. The drouth had eliminated much of the herbaceous vegetation com- monly eaten; fruits and berries were ab- sent. Monkeys gnawed dead almacigo limbs, picked seeds from weeds, ate the pads of prickly pear cactus, and spent much time digging the tuberous roots of an unidentified vine-like plant. None of the animals travelled rapidly or made pro- longed, direct moves. They moved slowly and fed avidly, and occasionally paused individually or in bunches to rest or groom. Water was obtained from succulent cactus pads and from occasional rain showers. August 1967:-Sufficient rain had fallen to abate the drouth and bring out new growths of vegetation. Trees were in leaf, new undergrowth had developed, fruits and berries were at a peak of abundance, as in August 1966. Thirty-six monkeys in a group dominated by Sll were sleeping each night in lower West Valley and drinking regularly again in the rain pool near Puerto de los Botes. Other monkeys could not be found and were presumed to be in another party. Activity and travel of the observed group were restricted to lower West and Long valleys and the area between them until the final day when they ascended to the head of Long Valley. The group apparently obtained all of the food it needed in this limited area of activity, particularly from the fruit of trees on the lower south side of Hill 104. They also ate cactus, bark, insects, and weed seeds. Daily travel distance was low except when the group moved to upper Long Val- ley. One entire day was spent within an area 300 m in diam. Although the group tended to stay together, individuals or small parties acted independently in mov- ing, grooming, resting, or feeding. No monkeys acted as leaders of movement. Animals became separated by 20-30 m when moving slowly between feeding areas, but were closer together, &lt; 20 m, when settled down or moving randomly. Despite the wide dispersion, vocalization was infrequent. Total spread reached 150 m in diam. Small parties ranged 300 m from the main group. May 1968:-Drouth had continued and conditions resembled those of 1967. Not only were the trees defoliated again, but much prickly pear cactus was dead or dying. The edges of many cactus pads were eaten away by goats and monkeys, causing yellowing of the pads, and this may have contributed to cactus mortality. Herba- ceous ground cover and forest undergrowth was shriveled, exposing much bare ground. Both groups of monkeys (Table 5) moved slowly and foraged much. Group 1 occupied the circular route (Fig. 19) from West Valley northward to Puerto Manglillo thence to Sego Can Ridge. The members exhibited no fear of observers. Group 2 foraged slowly in lower Long Valley, following the circular route, and it also evinced no fear of observers. Flight distance in both groups was &lt; 5 m. Although individuals were still more widely separated than at Cayo Santiago, members of each party were more coordi- nated as a group than in any visit since 57</page><page sequence="56">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS August 1966. Disciplinary actions by the dominant males were not seen in May and August 1967; resumption of strong control by dominant males was evident in 1968. All fed on almacigo fruit, berries, cactus, and seeds. As in past visits of 1967, in- dividuals paused to feed, interact, or rest as they chose. Behavior on Desecheo Island, 1969 and 1971 Notes from 1969 The 2 groups that formed in 1967 were still distinctly separate units when studied by Warshall and his associates during the summer and fall of 1969 (Warshall, pers. comm.). Members 132, JZ, 80, CQ, CU, and LS were not found. Monkeys identi- fied as to group affiliation in 1968 (Table 5) had the same group memberships in 1969. Excepting 80, LS, and CU, animals missing in 1968 were in Group 1 in 1969. The groups met infrequently. During en- counters they behaved as distinct units. Individuals, however, occasionally moved from one group to the other or interacted in extragroup encounters. Males ZN and ZS, which were 5 years old in 1969, often shifted back and forth between groups. HE was defeated in a fight with her daughter ZV, and moved from HM's to Sl1's group. She eventually returned to HM's group. Sll and 57, a female in HM's group, left their respective groups for 2 days and wandered together in sexual consort. Fighting apparently became more fre- quent and intensified in severity after the original Desecheo group divided. Male NV died of wounds received in a mauling by the unified members of Group 1, and HM fought with Sll on several occasions. Details of this and of other behavioral characteristics seen in 1969 will be pub- lished by Warshall. Observations in 1971 Warshall stayed on Desecheo through March 1971; Menzel visited the island from 11 to 20 May to census the monkeys and describe their current status and activities. Menzel observed the monkeys for a total of 50 hr, during which time chow was dis- tributed frequently to entice a maximum number together for censusing. Increased rainfall in 1969 through 1971 (Fig. 18) had produced extremely luxuriant growths of vegetation. West Valley was so densely covered with vines and grasses that it was almost impassable to humans. In other areas grasses were shoulder high. Forest undergrowth in some places limited visibility to &lt;25 m. Food, water, and cover were ideal for the monkeys, which were difficult to watch in the dense vege- tation. The monkeys appeared to be in excellent physical condition. No animal was obese, but not one was emaciated or had a dis- tended belly, suggesting protein deficiency in the diet, as was common during late 1966 and early 1967. All accessible parts of the island were searched except some of the impassable shore line and cliffs, but both groups of monkeys were found only in the upper parts of Long Valley, on or &lt; 100 m out- side the ridges bordering Long Valley, and at the lower end of West Valley near the shoreline (Figs. 5, 19). In all, the areas of use covered less than one-fifth of the total island surface. These areas are the kinds of places that a human observer would predict to be the best locations on the island for monkeys: they contain large groves of almacigo trees and abundant fruits, berries, and edible grasses; are the coolest parts of the island during the heat of the day; have little or no cactus and more open ground cover; and contain no bird nesting sites and odoriferous guano. Monkeys avoided the extremely dense ground cover in West Valley, an area they used often during our previous visits. The 68 marked and unmarked individuals seen by Menzel are listed in Table 6. Marked animals not found by Warshall in 1969 were still missing. CM, NX, TT, 57, C8, D5, and I9 also failed to appear. 58</page><page sequence="57">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel TABLE 6.-GROUP MEMBERSHIP, MAY 1971, DESECHEO ISLAND.

Warshall saw I9 and 57 in March 1971, and considered them to be a separate social group, but he did not find WA, AM, and TE which Menzel saw in May 1971. These discrepancies illustrate the difficulty of knowing whether missing animals are dead or have simply escaped notice. Any census is a minimum record of the population present. If 57 and 19 are credited with being alive in May 1971 and are added to the list of members observed (Table 6), at least 27 of the 41 tattooed animals released in 1966 were still alive in mid-1971. NV was known to have died in 1969 and it was highly probable that CE died in the first week on Desecheo, leaving 12 tattooed monkeys unaccounted for. Six of the miss- ing animals were born in 1959 or earlier, and, if still alive, would be at least 12 years of age in 1971. Four other missing animals would be at least 9 years old. All 12 would average 11.8 years in age if still alive. Including 19 and 57, the total of 70 mon- keys includes 24 of the tattooed adults born in 1964 or earlier, 7 animals born in 1965 and 1966, 23 individuals born during 1967 through 1970, and 15 infants of 1971. The 24 marked adults averaged 9.2 years in age. The original group released on Desecheo in 1966 included 7 yearlings and 13 infants. If the 13 missing members of these age groups and the 12 missing tattooed adults are dead, it reveals a higher mortality rate among the youngest and the oldest mem- bers of the colonists during the first 2- to 3-year period on Desecheo. The large pro- portion consisting of members born on Desecheo, especially in 1970 and 1971, suggests that the high rate of juvenile mortality did not persist beyond 1968. The membership of the 2 groups had 59</page><page sequence="58">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS changed little since 1968 and 1969 (Table 6). Female Cl and Male ZZ had moved from Group 2 to Group 1; Male FZ had changed from Group 1 to Group 2. Males WA and ZS, now 7 years of age and for- merly of Groups 1 and 2, respectively, were ranging alone apart from their groups, but it was not clear whether they were com- pletely solitary or were behaving as pe- ripheral males. The most significant changes in membership were that HM had replaced Sll as dominant male in Group 1, ZN had moved up to replace HM as dominant male in Group 2, and Sll was in Group 2 and subordinate to ZN. Throughout daily activities and move- ments, members of a group stayed within an area &lt; 100 m in diam. Within these limits, individuals separated more widely, espe- cially when foraging, than do rhesus mon- keys on Cayo Santiago, but each member was always within sighting distance of at least one other animal of its group. At no time did a group separate into wide-rang- ing, independent parties or individuals as in late 1966 and early 1967. The centers of the 2 groups stayed at least 200 m apart. Individuals of each group occasionally came within 15 m of each other, but they did not touch each other or intermingle. On 3 occasions within 1 hr, animals from each group came within 15 m of each other whereupon Group 2 moved 50-200 m away from the other group within a few minutes. There was no intergroup fighting or ag- gressive behavior other than brief vocal threats and tree shaking. Within each group, the organization of members by sex, age, and genealogical classes resembled the original structure at Cayo Santiago. The hierarchical standings of adult males were as ranked in Table 6. The standings were tested by presenting chow to pairs of individuals and noting which animal took the chow and which behaved subordinately. ZZ was not only subordinate to the other adult males but to several 3- and 4-year-old males also. The adult females were not tested extensively, but it was clear that RO4 was still domi- nant to all other females in Group 1 and to all males except HM and possibly to FK. Females usually remained apart during feeding and could not be tested. ZN did not aggressively dominate Sll. Even when monkey chow was put between ZN and Sll, their hierarchical relationship was demonstrated mildly. Both animals picked up chow, Sll grimaced slightly or pre- sented his posterior to ZN, then walked away. ZN did not threaten or attack Sll. Although severe fighting as reported by Warshall in 1969 was not observed in 1971, overall intragroup aggression was com- moner and more intensive in 1971 than in 1966-1967. It was approaching the rate of aggression at Cayo Santiago. Sporadic, brief squabbles broke out frequently among females and juveniles. Male ZS, now either solitary or peripheral to Group 1, was threatened and chased when he ap- proached the group. Low-ranking male ZZ was harassed often by several subadult males in Group 1. Males FZ and ZZ had split upper lips, a common form of combat injury. The only severe fighting seen, how- ever, was induced artificially when putting out chow. On 1 occasion, a strong fight lasting several minutes was heard at a dis- tance. Vocalizations from it indicated that several adults were involved. Aside from nursing, grooming was the commonest form of social interaction. Pos- sibly because the birth season was com- pleted and females with infants clustered together, most grooming was among adult females. In one 2-hr period, 8 females with infants in Group 1 rested on the same tree branch within an area of 1 m2, and alter- nately slept or groomed with each other. In general, male juveniles groomed each other and female juveniles groomed adult fe- males. Adult males groomed little, usually sitting alone about 5 m from the nearest animal. On all previous visits to Desecheo in 1966-1968, we saw fewer than 12 instances of any kind of play, none of which lasted &gt; 15 sec or involved an animal older than 1 year. In 1971, a dozen bouts of play 60</page><page sequence="59">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel could be seen hourly. Yearlings and juve- niles of 2-3 years in age created most of the play, but 20 incidences of play were seen among infants. Play involving infants consisted of gentle wrestling and biting. Older juveniles joined together in "games" of leaping or swinging about a fixed point, but participants made little or no body contact. Games lasted from a few minutes to 0.5 hr. On one occasion, a part of 5 2 and 3 year olds were watched for 25 min as they swung, jumped, and tumbled from a vine, and periodically chased each other. Before they finished, several yearlings be- gan a similar game about 15 m away. Occasionally, a juvenile grabbed an in- fant and played with it for a few minutes. Adult male WS cradled and bounced an infant for 2 min while its mother lay a few feet away. Even the most dominant males of Group 1, HM and FK, were seen in a brief bout of wrestling with older juveniles. The ages of infants were 1 to 2 months. No female seen with an infant in March lacked that infant in May, indicating that maternal care was at least adequate to pre- vent mortality. All infants appeared to be active, well fed, and in good physical con- dition. Infants were carried and handled by their mothers at a rate comparable to that at Cayo Santiago, which contrasts markedly with the inattention to infants shown by mothers in 1966. As in previous years, infants on Desecheo were considerably more independent of their mothers and mothers showed far less concern about their infants' wanderings than do their counterparts on Cayo Santi- ago. For example, Females AM and FE left their infants for more than 2 hr to sit near Menzel while he put out chow and censused. Both females were in view throughout the period, and neither of them oriented to or communicated with her in- fant. When feeding ceased and the group moved on, AM and FE retrieved their infants from trees 30 m away. Other group members were at the feeding site, so the infants were alone in their trees. When females groomed or slept, their infants moved about the area freely, explor- ing and playing without maternal restriction or concern. During the progress of play, infants crawled over one female or another, but they were not punished or threatened for it. No mother threatened another's infant, even in some cases where an infant tried to nurse a female not its mother. Males and juveniles sometimes carried an infant &gt; 5 m from the mother to hold or play with it. The mildness and tolerance shown by the Desecheo mothers to each other's infants, and to young monkeys and adult males touching the infants, were in marked contrast to the hostility often ex- hibited in these circumstances at Cayo Santiago. In 1966-1968, infants commonly ranged &gt; 30 m from their mothers while foraging alone for long periods. The infants of 1971 foraged and explored out to 15 m, apparently coming and going at will and never being frightened or causing alarm to their mothers. Yearlings seldom stayed with their moth- ers, even during rest periods. They moved in seemingly complete independence in all activities, and travelled together in their own party during group travel. It was difficult, if not impossible, to identify the mother of each yearling from behavioral interactions, for a yearling frequently groomed adult females in several geneal- ogies in the course of an hour. The overall behavior of all juveniles showed that adult- level independence occurs at an earlier age at Desecheo than at Cayo Santiago. On Cayo Santiago, before June 1966, juveniles were occupied much with staring at or harassing of people. This was done more often by 4- to 8-year-old monkeys on Desecheo in 1971, and the juveniles and yearlings, especially the yearlings, required several days before approaching within 15 m of the observer. They did not harass observers in the seemingly playful desire to torment as is done at Cayo Santiago. Re- versal of these behavioral characteristics at Desecheo may reflect the adults' long tradition of contact with people, whereas juveniles have seen very little of humans. 61</page><page sequence="60">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS Old Females UC, XS, R04, and IP came to take chow from Menzel's hand on the first encounter in 1971. No juvenile ever did so. Female UC sat within 2 m of the observer and allowed her infant to go within 0.5 m of him. In the first meetings with each group, especially with Group 2, most of the mem- bers were wary of the observer. After chow was revealed they moved in gradu- ally to sit near him. On 20 occasions, novel objects such as cigar butts, tin cans, pieces of food, bits of paper, etc. were placed among the monkeys. In no instance did a juvenile investigate the object. Adults did so by picking up the object to smell it then discard it within 10 sec. None of the monkeys investigated or manipulated non- food objects presented outside the context of food-getting activity. At Cayo Santiago, before 1966, in the original group, monkeys of all ages readily investigated novel ob- jects, the juveniles doing so more than the adults. Members of each of the 2 groups were still holding together in coordination and common activity, similarly to their organi- zation of 1968 and in marked contrast to the extreme dispersion of late 1966 and early 1967. They travelled infrequently, their movements being brief, random, and slow. They still fed, groomed, and rested at random throughout the day, never show- ing the sequential pattern of feeding in the morning and resting in the afternoon that existed at Cayo Santiago before June 1966. They devoted a much higher proportion of the day to resting, grooming, and nursing, and spent less time at moving and foraging than was seen in any previous visit. Reproduction and Molt During 1966 and 1967, the annual period in which conceptions occur appears to have shifted to a later time of year in monkeys transferred to Desecheo. The time of an- nual pelage molt, which at Cayo Santiago coincides with the birth season (Vessey and Morrison 1970), also became later at Desecheo, and in 1968 was delayed con- siderably past the time it was expected to begin. Newborn infants at Cayo Santiago have been observed closely for several years, and nearly all birth dates are known within 1 or 2 days of parturition. Birth dates are restricted to the first 6 months of the year, and the majority occur in a 2-month period which peaks in March or April (Altmann 1962, Koford 1965). Koford (1966) ob- served that initial annual birth dates varied 46 days (29 December to 13 February) and median dates 34 days (2 March to 5 April) in the 5-year period of 1960-1964. The final annual birth dates during these years ranged 65 days, with the latest falling on 25 July. The average duration of gestation is 168 days in the rhesus (Hurme and van Wage- nen 1953). Backdating 168 days from the birth dates recorded by Koford (1966) reveals annual ranges of conceptions ex- tending from 14 July to 21 February within which annual peaks occur between 15 Sep- tember and 19 October. Kaufmann (1965) also observed monkeys at Cayo Santiago in 1960-1962 and concluded that most con- ceptions occur from early August through December and that the annual peak occurs in September or October. Our findings at Cayo Santiago in 1965-1967 concur with those of Koford and of Kaufmann. Adults at Desecheo did not copulate or show typical signs of sexual activity such as reddened and swollen sex skin, mount- ing, increased aggression and wounding, consort pairing, and enlarged testes (Car- penter 1942a, Sade 1964) during the ob- servation periods of August and October 1966. In February 1967, adult females had well-developed sex skin, but they lacked the edematous swelling and ridging of the legs prominent in some females during the height of the mating season. Male Sll's testes were small and positioned more medially in the nonbreeding condition that is present at this time also in adult males at Cayo Santiago, but 132 had deeply 62</page><page sequence="61">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel scrotal, enlarged testes typical of the mating season. Copulations were not seen, however. The fur on hips and thighs of adults and subadults had molted, but anterior body parts still retained much old fur. Molt was approximately one-third to one-half com- plete among all members. Molt was more advanced at Cayo Santiago where many individuals were near the end of molt, hav- ing molted extensively on the head and foreparts in the sequence illustrated by Vessey and Morrison (1970). On 8 May 1967, Female AM was carry- ing a 1-week-old infant that probably was conceived in late November 1966. This was the only infant found. Of the other adult females seen, only CM appeared to be pregnant. Sex skin coloration and other evidences of the mating season were absent. Molt was about one-half to three-fourths complete at Desecheo, while at Cayo Santi- ago many individuals had completely molted and others were more than three- fourths finished. Females CM, CU, and IP each had a new infant several weeks old in August 1967. CM appeared pregnant in May, but IP did not seem gravid then and CU was not found. These 3 infants probably were born in late May or early June. If so, they were conceived in December 1966, about 2 months past the time of the peak of con- ceptions at Cayo Santiago. Molt was complete and reproductive ac- tivity had commenced in August 1967. Male Sll and about two-thirds of the females &gt; 4 years of age had well-de- veloped sex skin. Sll was in consort with his sister R04. They engaged in at least 2 extended copulations each of which in- cluded several mountings before Sll ejaculated. Males NV, WA, and an un- identified 3- or 4-year-old male also copu- lated with various females. In some cases they copulated close by Sll who did not interfere with them. At Cayo Santiago, dominant males rarely permit young males to copulate in their presence. Adult Males HM and JZ were not seen, but were pre- sumed to be in mating condition also. We found 9 new infants on 28-29 May 1968. Five were in Sl1's band, 4 were in HM's. Females WN and NX (4 and 6 years old, respectively) in Sl1's band may also have had infants which were foraging apart from their mothers and escaped our view during the period of observation. Female 57 in HM's band lacked an infant. She probably failed to conceive because of her advanced age (13 years) and debili- tated condition. The infants' ages were estimated to range from I to 5 weeks, but most of them, especially in HM's band, appeared to be 2-3 weeks of age. Con- ception of these infants would have oc- curred from the beginning of November to early December 1967, again later by 1-2 months than the peak of conceptions at Cayo Santiago. An unusual situation prevailed at Desecheo in May 1968 in that molt had not started despite the progress of the birth season. Monkeys at Cayo Santiago were one-half to two-thirds molted by May. At Desecheo, Sll was the only animal with new fur, and his pelage change was re- stricted to the tip of his tail, which is the characteristic starting point of molt (Ves- sey and Morrison 1970). In 1971, births at Desecheo came earlier than in 1967 or in 1968, coinciding with the average time of peaking at Cayo Santiago. Ten infants were born in March and 5 in April or early May. Menzel believed that 2 females were still pregnant in May. Molt had just commenced, its first stages showing on young males, whereas molt at Cayo Santiago had commenced near the first of the year and was almost complete in May. The annual schedule of mating, birth, and molt at Cayo Santiago after June 1966, was not noticeably different from other groups there or from its own record pre- vious to 1966. Dividing Group H had no apparent effect on reproduction or molt in the part remaining at Cayo Santiago. 63</page><page sequence="62">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS DISCUSSION As in all research, findings may be questioned. Of this study it can be asked whether or not the most meaningful results were identified and revealed accurately, and if so, whether they illustrate typical rhesus adaptability or are merely unique aberrancies that may not be duplicated. Would we have gotten the same results had a different combination of individual monkeys been in each postdivision sub- group or had the larger part been kept at Cayo Santiago and the smaller one sent to Desecheo? Were the most appropriate phenomena used as criteria for comparing pre- and postdivision situations? Were suf- ficient observations made and were they interpreted correctly? Did all postdivision behavioral changes result from the alter- ation imposed or would some have oc- curred anyway had the group been left intact at Cayo Santiago? It is well to repeat here the objective of the study, which was to describe the effects of altering Group H and its environment, in the manner done, to judge the feasibility of such treatment as a basis for studying variability and behavior in adaptation. It was not expected to provide the final answers on the adaptability of rhesus. Not knowing what to expect from alter- ing Group H, we were at first uncertain as to the most appropriate characteristics to use as criteria in evaluating the effect of change. We selected attributes that seemed most overt, persistent, and meaningful to group function. Many useful character- istics, possibly more important than the ones chosen, were undoubtedly overlooked. We judged criteria according to prevalent explanations of rhesus biology in current literature, but did not attempt to verify hypotheses about the significance of spe- cific behavioral traits. Limitations on work- ing time and difficulties in transportation prevented getting enough observations and measurements for extensive statistical com- parisons of the subgroups. We had to as- sume that predivision characteristics of H were typical and would have remained little changed through late 1966 and afterward except for normal maturational changes affecting individuals. We had to assume also that changes in postdivision behavior could be attributed to the conditions im- posed, excepting characteristics that ex- perience enabled us to identify as probable maturational changes. Stages of Postdivisional Adjustment Although the postdivision subgroups dif- fered in their unique ways of adjusting to the new environmental situations, they resembled each other in going through 4 apparent stages of adjusting to their changed circumstances: 1. Initial reaction to the alteration. 2. Prolonged adjustment to the new con- ditions, accompanied by loss of some original characteristics and gain of new ones. 3. Resumption of some temporarily aban- doned original characteristics and di- minishment or loss of some new ones. 4. Maintenance of a new living routine in the new environmental situation with minor adjustments in both old and new characteristics of behavior and organi- zation. The approximate temporal periods of the stages at each island are exemplified with some of the key behavioral events occurring in them. First Stage At Cayo Santiago, the first stage lasted until October 1966. The greatly diminished group showed no drastic change in overall attitude or daily routine. It seemed not to have major problems except for inability to remain dominant over Groups F, I, and J. The initial reaction, or first stage of adjustment, at Desecheo extended through August 1966. The group persisted as a unit although distance between members in- creased. Genealogical ties became weaker, 64</page><page sequence="63">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel dominance and control by adult males lessened. Discipline was milder and co- ordination poorer than before division. Aggression was low. The former pattern of daily activities changed quickly, with in- tensive travel in long marches becoming a principal activity, superseding the periods spent formerly at chow stations or in rest- ing areas. Members learned new foods and the locations of feeding areas. Play and exploration diminished among juveniles. Second Stage Greater difference between the 2 groups arose in the second stage which lasted at least until observations ended in June 1967 at Cayo Santiago, and probably continued for several months afterward. Having be- come the most subordinate group, H was restricted to but a part of its former range and was fearful and elusive. Members were quiet except when fighting. Intra- group cohesion was tighter; discipline and intragroup aggression heightened. H spent a larger part of each day attempting to get sufficient chow from feeding stations, and this was associated with increased fre- quency of agonistic encounters with other groups. Rest, exploration, and play di- minished. At Desecheo, the second stage lasted from October 1966 through May 1967. Genealogical ties became even weaker while interanimal distance increased until the group was dissociated each day into widespread independent-acting units which ranged widely over the island. Slow, con- tinuous moving was accompanied by continuous feeding and by intermittent nursing, resting, and grooming at leisure. Vocalizations occurred frequently through- out each day. Control by adult males al- most disappeared, aggression was extremely low, and disciplinary or hierarchical inter- actions diminished to insignificant levels. Juvenile play was virtually extinct. By May 1967, 2 groups seemed to be forming, although controlling dominance over each group by adult males was absent. Third Stage The third stage was marked by surprising returns to original group characteristics at each island. The beginning date of this stage at Cayo Santiago is unknown, but it was probably in late 1967 or early 1968, sometime before our observations in June 1968. H was still subordinate to other groups and its range reduced to include but a part of Cayo Grande, but its behavior had become similar to the traits demon- strated by the original group in 1965 and early in 1966. It no longer skulked in hiding but moved openly, and was more aggressive at the feeders. Intragroup ag- gression seemed reduced to the pre- divisional level. At Desecheo, Stage 3 was seen first in August 1967 when two groups had un- doubtedry developed. Only 1 group was observed, but it was dominated by an adult male, condensed into a coordinated unit, and restricted in travel to a small part of the island. In May 1968, both groups of monkeys were seen and they were definitely in 2 groups with strong male dominance over each. Although individual members ranged apart more widely than at Cayo Santiago, they functioned together as a coordinated unit rather than range independently and widely apart as they had in late 1966 and early 1967. Aggres- sion and play were common, members of genealogies stayed closer together, and the overall behavior of each group resembled the original, predivision group. Fourth Stage This period was a continuation of the third stage, but it included additional minor adjustments in behavior and organi- zation at Desecheo. It was principally a time of settling into a routine of living that probably would continue for some time without significant variations, except from normal maturational changes of in- dividuals, deaths, and meteorological vari- ations. Both the Cayo Santiago and the Desecheo monkeys probably entered this 65</page><page sequence="64">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS stage at or soon after May 1968. The Desecheo groups persisted in it until at least May 1971. We presume the H mon- keys at Cayo Santiago did likewise until some of them were removed from the island after 1968. Influences Affecting Postdivisional Organization and Status Peculiarities of environment at each island shaped the postdivisional history of each subgroup. Difficulty in getting suf- ficient food was a serious problem for several months at both islands. Interwoven with this problem were the influences of predivisional traditions of social behavior, hierarchy, genealogical relationships, and individual traits of the adults that con- trolled interactions and activities. The peculiarities of adult males seemed espe- cially influential on the final outcome of each part of H. At Cayo Santiago, feeding was a prob- lem of members not having sufficient time to get chow from a station before another group evicted them. At Desecheo, it was a matter of the individual monkey being able to find food (some kinds being in low abundance or available only in certain sea- sons) and grab it before another monkey took it. As food seeking became the pre- dominant daily activity of each subgroup, other activities were modified to accommo- date this need. Each subgroup evolved new patterns of daily activity appropriate to its local situation. The different effects of reduced food supply on the animals at each island were similar to incidents reported in other studies. Hall (1963a) described a situation in Africa which resembled events at Desecheo. Hall found deteriorated social organization in groups of chacma baboons stranded without sufficient food on an island created by the rising waters behind Kariba Dam. The social groups broke up into small, straggling parties. Reproduc- tion, aggressive domination by adult males, maternal care of infants, and intragroup squabbling ceased in the intensive search- ing for food. At Cayo Santiago, suppliers failed to deliver full provisioning of chow for 22 days in July 1968. During this interval, partial chow rations were dis- tributed on 10 days, but 12 consecutive days passed without any chow being fed. Corn and fruit were substituted for the missing chow; but it was insufficient to sustain the monkeys, and Group F, being observed by Loy (1970), adopted behavior resembling the actions made there by H in early 1967. F did not split up into foraging parties; group organization was unchanged. It foraged more on natural vegetation, and its general activity level diminished. Play, grooming, body contact, and voluntary moves decreased. Unlike H, though, intra- group aggression and displacements of subordinates decreased. Dispersion at Desecheo also resembled the splitting of gelada baboon groups into separate forag- ing units which occurs after food becomes scarce (Crook 1966). At Cayo Santiago, postdivisional co- hesion and coordination of H was intensi- fied by greater control imposed by the new dominant male, BC. The intensifi- cation was in response to increased pres- sures from other groups, some of which had only recently become dominant to H. It was noteworthy that Group I began to dominate H, after division, sooner than did F, which was much larger and higher in rank than Group I. This phenomenon is attributed to what may have been a feud continuing from intragroup dissension that preceded former Group G splitting into H and I in 1960. From July 1965 to July 1966, H had twice as many aggressive interactions with Group I (50%) than with F (25 %) or with J (25 % ). After division on 1 July 1966, the high proportion of en- counters H had with I increased to 70% and decreased to 15% each with F and J. Because of their common origin and high rate of conflict, I may have been better acquainted with H than were F or J, and I was able to recognize H's diminished strength sooner than could the other groups. Before its division, H always de- 66</page><page sequence="65">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel feated I; afterward, H always lost to I. Group I took every opportunity to attack H after their hierarchical positions were reversed. Before July 1966, Group I usually re- sisted being displaced by H. Group J, however, had always been extremely sub- ordinate to H and was quick to avoid con- flict with H by moving away well ahead of potential encounters. Consequently, J prob- ably required more time than I or F to perceive H's loss of numbers and to take advantage of it. After defeating H, J at- tacked it unhesitatingly. As the 2 most subordinate groups present, H and J oc- casionally met when both sought to hide in the same place while eluding pursuers. J then forced H to seek another refuge. The delay of formerly subordinate groups in challenging H's dominance and the severity of the decisive battle between F and H suggest that intragroup traditions are strong. Extreme dispersion and travel became the pattern for awhile at Desecheo. Neither having to concentrate at feeders to com- pete for chow with other groups nor having to fight nor elude more dominant groups, the Desecheo monkeys were engaged in private responses to features of their habitat rather than in collective wariness and preoccupation with fixed points such as chow stations and hiding places. Dis- persing independently increased the prob- ability of food being discovered, decreased competition for food, and thus made forag- ing more productive. It may also have contributed to the eventual formation of 2 groups. Spontaneous division of the Desecheo monkeys into 2 groups was an unexpected development. Carpenter (1942b) suggested that there are species-defined limits to the size of a group that can be coordinated effectively, and that group fission occurs when these size limits are exceeded. He found that macaque groups usually divided gradually into new groups of unequal size after 2 dominant males became antago- nistic, each gained control of 1 or more genealogies of females and offspring, and the new congregations began avoiding each other. Southwick et al. (1965) found this to be true of a rhesus group of 51 members in India that required several months to divide into distinctly separate groups. Koford (1966) found small groups of rhesus dividing as well as large ones, and he attributed division to social factors rather than to group size. He noted that fission tended to occur in the mating season when intragroup tension and conflict were in- tensified. Fission in 2 groups of free-ranging Jap- anese macaques occurred in different ways according to analyses by their wit- nesses. A group of 580 monkeys at Taka- sakiyama divided slowly over a period of 10 months (Sugiyama 1960). Sugiyama attributed the division to 3 principal causes. First was a relaxation of social organization in which a branch of the group began to travel independently from the main body. Second, adult males of unstable social status formed a new nucleus of leadership in the off-branching group. Sugiyama noted also that the division be- gan in March, at the end of the mating season, intensified during the period be- tween young-leaf growth and the onset of fruiting, a time of reduced food supply, and that social organization relaxed be- cause of population increase. The other group of Japanese macaques contained 160 monkeys living near Gagyusan. Furuya (1962) reported that fission occurred en- tirely during March 1968, probably be- ginning and ending in the first 2 weeks of the month. He believed that overpopu- lation was not responsible because the group was small, and there was no relax- ation of social organization leading up to the division. Unlike the Takasakiyama group, no branching part began moving away in activities separate from the main group, and no males constituted a second- ary nucleus outside the group center. When the group suddenly divided, the departing segment was controlled by 2 leading males which had lost status to a 67</page><page sequence="66">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS formerly subdominant male which had ascended in rank by inducing other low- ranking males to cooperate with him in jointly attacking the higher-ranking males. One of the 2 males that went away with the off-branching part was the principal object of these attacks. Group fission at Desecheo was similar to the process at Takasakiyama except that adult males had no influence on it, the females making the division without domi- nant male control over either part. There was no conflict that could have led to division in the manner described by Furuya (1962), and Males 132, Sll, and HM neither fought among themselves nor totally dominated the others in typical fashion until well after the division was complete. Sll and HM then became dominant group leaders by taking over the 2 separate units already created by the females. The ability of female macaques to establish and maintain, temporarily at least, social organization in the absence of strong control by dominant males has been ob- served in other studies. When the domi- nant male of a group of Japanese macaques died, leadership was assumed by 2 domi- nant females. A 4-year-old male held the third-ranking position (Kawai 1960). In India, Neville (1968) found a forest dwell- ing group of rhesus that lacked adult males and was led by adult females. This group was more mobile and had a larger home range than other forest groups con- trolled by males. Kawai and Neville did not state the longevity of organization in these 2 groups. Among rhesus at La Parguera, P. R., groups not dominated by adult males lasted but a few months. Vandenbergh (1967) studied a population of rhesus created on 2 islands at La Parguera by releasing, in 1962-1963, several shipments of monkeys imported from India and Cayo Santiago. Only 1 small shipment, from Cayo Santiago, came from the same social group. All others were captured randomly. From this disorganized aggre- gation, 6 social groups were formed spon- taneously by gatherings of adult females. Adult males eventually entered and became dominant over 4 groups. The other 2 groups disbanded after 6 and 9 months duration, respectively, which Vandenbergh attributed to lack of stabilizing control by dominant males. Vandenbergh (1967) noted that some females and males tended to shift much between groups, but certain adult females stayed in their respective groups and pro- vided consistency of membership. The hierarchical ranks of groups were deter- mined by these females, but social stability of a group was provided by its dominant male through his intragroup disciplinary aggression and defense of the group against other monkeys. Vandenbergh felt that lack of kinship delayed shifting animals from becoming permanently associated with any group. Postdivisional events at both Cayo Santi- ago and Desecheo included elements re- sembling the phenomena described in the studies just cited, but also had unique characteristics which illustrated further the roles of dominant males and the potential mechanisms for achieving group stability. The ultimate forms of hierarchical status, activity, and organization in each subgroup were influenced strongly by the peculiari- ties of the adult males which happened to accompany each subgroup. Adult males usually achieve dominance after several years of slowly rising in the hierarchy. BC inherited suddenly and without contest the role of dominant male when 132 was removed, but afterward BC had to do more with the role than simply occupy it. H's survival as a viable group after becoming subordinate to F, I, and J was attributable to BC's eminence. He seemed in control of everything H did, leading activities and enforcing discipline, and by himself or with the help of adult females, he defended H in the many con- flicts with other groups after losing support from the wounded KP. Had BC not existed and had KP inherited leadership from 132, H may have eventually disintegrated or 68</page><page sequence="67">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel become attached to another group. BC's travail was shown clearly in the increase of wounds he received in 1967. It would not have been surprising had BC aban- doned H to find an easier role eleswhere. It is more than coincidental that after R15 supplanted KP, and NE matured to function as an adult male, H regained by mid-1968 much of its former aggressiveness and overtness in daily activities. The change in group behavior from furtiveness and evasion was a result of group strength increasing from 1 to 3 effective males. The outcome at Desecheo capped a sequence of fortuitious events in which adult males and females both had promi- nent roles. Male 132 soon lost effective control of the group after July 1966, but Sll and HM remained subordinate to him for several weeks and apparently lacked also the ability to dominate females until August 1967. During this interval, diffi- culties in getting food became acute, and females and young had to disperse widely to forage. Adult females apparently main- tained a degree of organization but, in the absence of control by males, also made the split which ultimately formed 2 separate groups. Maintenance of organization by the females probably reflected the stabiliz- ing influence of the genealogical kinships present. By February 1967, Sll was equal in authority to 132; and in May, by which time 132 had disappeared, Sll was acting dominantly. By August, Sll was leading a group. In 1968, foraging no longer seemed a problem. Females and young stayed to- gether in cohesive, coordinated units domi- nated by Sll and HM. Considering the long flight distances and extreme wariness to humans shown by individual females and young when they were dispersed so extensively to seek food, while not showing fear of us when they were together in large parties, their aggregation into per- manently cohesive groups again after forag- ing became easier was done probably to reduce fear of isolation. Sll and HM were able to assume dominance by then of the 2 groups evolved during the aggregating. HM's ascendancy to group leader is note- worthy because he was a peripheral male at least until 132 was gone, and was sub- ordinate to NV, the son of dominant fe- male S17. NV apparently could not prevail against HM's greater size and age, and in the presence of only 1 other dominant male (Sll) HM was able to become a leader without going through several years in the roles of third- and second-ranking males as usually occurs between peripheral status and highest rank in the large groups at Cayo Santiago and La Parguera. If Vandenbergh (1967) is correct, domi- nant males stabilize their groups by dis- ciplining intragroup strife and defending members in intergroup conflict. This seemed true of BC at Cayo Santiago. At Desecheo, aggression was extremely low and the hypothetical need for the stabiliz- ing influence of dominant males did not arise until after the 2 new groups were under control by Sll and HM. It was as though male dominance brought on the very conditions that dominant males were seemingly needed to protect against at La Parguera or Cayo Santiago. This raises a question as to how much conflict males in- cite and how much they prevent. Warshall saw considerable aggression at Desecheo in 1969. NV was attacked by Group 1 and driven into the sea, after which he died of wounds. This kind of aggression might be necessary to achieve group stability by eliminating disturbing elements, but is it useful in groups where conflict might otherwise be insignificant? Important questions need further study concerning the spontaneous formation of groups such as occurred at Desecheo. If the groups can actually arise and function in the absence of control by dominant males, who then controls group member- ship? Why have male control at all? What is their actual purpose? Why did the new groups occupying together &lt; 20% of Desecheo in May 1971 bother to remain apart? Was separation solely an artifact 69</page><page sequence="68">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS caused by the males? Could the Cayo Santi- ago members have persisted as a group after July 1966 without any dominant males? Koford (1963) reported that some groups on Cayo Santiago maintained their organization and hierarchical status after their dominant males were removed. A useful experiment would be removal of the dominant males in one or both of the Desecheo groups to learn whether the groups would reunite or remain separate. An especially interesting opportunity for experiment existed at the end of 1966, after the 2 subgroups had been separated 6 months, when the 26 H members at Cayo Santiago could have been moved to Desecheo and allowed to interact with the other part. Eventual cohesion of members in the 2 groups which did form at Desecheo must have been expedited by ample food being available, and widespread foraging was no longer necessary. If food was di- minished experimentally, would the mem- bers of each group commence dispersing independently again or would the dominant males prevent it? Changes in Behavior During the initial stage of adjustment to the alteration, both parts of H acted quickly in overcoming or accommodating challenges. During the first few days on Desecheo, the subgroup encountering the most drastic change was slightly un- coordinated, but it never became seriously disorganized. Except possibly for the pro- longed battle in which the subgroup at Cayo Santiago became subordinate to Group F, neither subgroup was seen mak- ing dangerously inappropriate actions in responding as units to new phenomena. Individuals erred, as when bumping against novel objects such as cactus spines or hornet nests at Desecheo, but the group as a whole did not exhibit collective errors in behavior that could have brought im- mediate harm to several members. A more revealing test of this apparent ability to respond appropriately would be exposure to a new environment that includes un- accustomed predators, more rigorous cli- matic phenomena, or unfamiliar toxic foods. We had planned to observe which in- dividuals originated the use of new foods at Desecheo, but learning was so rapid and immediately widespread that it could not be traced under the existing conditions. Some postfission feeding habits were elaborations of behavior learned at Cayo Santiago. Monkeys usually drank from fountains and rainpools at Cayo Santiago. They drank also from a hollow tree at Cliff Point (Fig. 20) when resting or forag- ing in that vicinity, distant from other places to drink. Although they depended on monkey chow for their dietary mainstay, all animals learned from infancy to use available natural food. These knowledges were applied immediately at Desecheo. They came into use more frequently at Cayo Santiago after H's hierarchical stand- ing decreased and the group had much difficulty getting chow. Few monkeys changed noticeably in "personality" or individual traits directly after the original group was divided, and these changes seemed the result of illness or the opportunity to overcome former social restrictions rather than influences of the physical environment or other groups. The absence of 132 enabled BC to become dominant male just as R04 could become dominant female in the absence of S17. Male 132's rapid loss of dominance was probably from old age aggravated by ill- ness. Formerly he ate well on chow. At Desecheo he seemed reluctant to seek food, and he usually appeared exhausted and withdrawn from other monkeys. Females 57 and 80 lost rank and became passive presumably because they were ill, as evi- denced by extreme loss of weight, coarsened pelage, and depressed behavior. Aside from these changes, individuals did not develop bizarre or radically new char- acteristics. At least, the more outstanding or noticeable members persisted in their idiosyncracies most familiar to us, and we presume that members were reassured at 70</page><page sequence="69">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel finding each other's behavior familiar and predictable in the new situations. Strong behavioral changes that did occur in 1966 affected most of the monkeys in a given social role or age class rather than just one or a few individuals. Two most remarkable changes were the sophistication and independence of infants and the re- duction of maternal interest by their mothers at Desecheo. At Cayo Santiago, the infants continued to remain close to their solicitous mothers and were defended vigorously by other adults when alarmed. Maternal and group interest in comforting or protecting infants, even when humans were near, ended almost immediately after landing on Desecheo. Presumably, this was a result of the need to find food for survival. Fortunately, the infants proved immensely capable of taking care of them- selves, showing self-confidence and in- dependence in roaming solitarily in a manner never seen in infants of that age at Cayo Santiago and demonstrating their own high ability to survive. In July and August 1966, the Desecheo infants were observed many times when &gt; 30 m from their mothers and deeply engrossed in seek- ing and getting food. They showed no fear of being alone or of older monkeys coming near, and they sounded no infant lost calls. If humans approached infants closely or surprised them, they would go higher into their tree or jump to a nearby tree and move away. But they did not panic, scream, or run to mother, and other monkeys did not come to protect them by threatening the humans. The age at which infants become independent of their mothers ap- parently cannot be understood without taking into account ecological as well as maturational factors. Another profound behavioral change in the first stage of response was the cessation of play and playful investigation or explo- ration by the juveniles at both islands. Play ceased soon after arriving at Desecheo, but at Cayo Santiago it did not stop until after H fell to the lowest hierarchical position. At Desecheo, intensive foraging appeared to displace play. At Cayo Santiago, the general apprehension among members as well as the greater effort to get food ap- peared to depress play. Yet at both islands there were numerous times in which juve- niles stopped feeding for periods of various lengths in which play could have occurred had juveniles been motivated to do so. Play was eventually resumed at both islands after each part of H regained organization and behavior more similar to the predivisional pattern and food was obtainable with considerably less effort. Whether their temporary failure to play arose from malnutrition, social disruption, or other causes, and what effect the ab- sence of play had on the social develop- ment of the individual juvenile, remain questions to be answered through more intensive study. Harassing or teasing of humans by juveniles also recurred at Cayo Santiago, but was not done at Desecheo in 1968 or 1971. In 1971, juveniles would not even approach to take chow from an observer although adults did so readily. A specific survival value is not readily apparent in this change. The adults seemed to have retained a familiarity with humans learned when they were juveniles, whereas the contemporary juveniles were not exposed daily to the example of their elders reacting with people, as on Cayo Santiago. The fate of peripheral Male CE was not predicted, but his leaving the other males upon release at Desecheo and disappearing a few days later was not surprising. He probably died then, as he was never seen again. Low survival was expected for orphaned juveniles, especially for yearlings and 2 year olds separated from all of their adult relatives. We believed that other members might reject or even attack them and diminish their chances for getting food and staying with the group. However, all orphans maintained their roles among their age-mates and never seemed to be dis- advantaged. They remained completely accepted by other members and partici- pated in grooming, play, and other non- 71</page><page sequence="70">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS aggressive social relationships. Orphans at Desecheo seemed to learn as rapidly as any member where to find food and water and how to rejoin other monkeys after ranging alone for a time. At Cayo Santiago, adults that had seldom before shown a tendency to protect juveniles from older animals did so when the occasion required. Orphans stayed together much of the time, and undoubtedly provided useful companion- ship to each other. Some orphans had older siblings to associate with, but Male NV ignored his younger sisters ZF and Cl which associated closely with each other. Concentration of movement on the circu- lar travel route (Fig. 19) at the west end of the island was a peculiar phenomenon. The route was used exclusively for several weeks, and it was still followed on long, direct moves when the monkeys were spending much of the day moving about randomly to feed. The route may have been established on the first day of pro- longed travel when they chose the most attractive options for easiest travel while proceeding, keeping to the main directions of travel until a major change in direction was necessary or more desirable. After- ward they kept to this route because it was familiar to them and was still the best route for direct travel and stayed within the best habitat, and connected main feed- ing and roosting areas. The principal value in the kind of experi- ment exemplified here is for analyzing the mechanisms by which primate social groups maintain adaptation. The complexi- ties of organization and function in these groups and the difficulties in explaining them in free-ranging, natural populations are enormous. Kummer (1967) articulated convincing support for experimental trans- fers of primates into unfamiliar habitats to study environmental modifications of group organization, but his working hypothesis for doing so seems much at odds with the general opinion of other primatologists. Kummer stated: "Improb- able as it sounds, social behavior as we have described it cannot be the cause of differences in social organization. We obviously must separate the two phenom- ena more clearly in our research than we have done so far." As noted in the intro- duction, Kummer distinguished social be- havior as a genetic characteristic which he apparently considered unchangeable, and organization as a labile, nonspecific phe- nomenon readily modified to fit environ- mental pressures. The results of this study are by no means sufficiently comprehensive to test Kum- mer's (1967) hypothesis, but several in- cidents revealed both behavioral and organizational changes that seemed closely interconnected with each other and with the altered environmental characteristics. These results are more in accord with the opinions of Scott (1956), Crook (1966, 1970b), and Hall (1968) who indicated that organi- zation is at least in part based on social behavior, with physiologic, genetic, experi- ential, and environmental features in- fluencing their relationship. Crook and Gartlan (1966) and Crook (1970b) have created a more enlightening explanation of behavior and organization by placing them within the context of a greater "socio-demo- graphic" system, diagrammed in both articles cited, which includes interactions between the principal components of the population and between these components and key elements of the environment. The end product is a social structure under multifactorial control of genetic inheri- tance, learning, and environment. Crook (1970b) made a comprehensive summary of knowledge accumulated to date on primate social systems, and he out- lined several aspects of social behavior and ecology, too extensive to repeat here, need- ing research for developing new informa- tion and testing past findings. Many of the items listed are appropriate for analysis by transferring groups to new habitats. As mentioned earlier, such studies will be dif- ficult and expensive. One of the greatest challenges in research of this kind is recog- nizing the effects of the experimental treatment. Howard (1965) pointed out 72</page><page sequence="71">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel that mammals have a high degree of be- havioral and genetic plasticity and have a great capacity to adapt phenotypically to either new biotypes created by man or to new natural environments they may colo- nize. Howard remarked further on the dif- ficulty in differentiating between genetic phenotypes and subtle alterations caused momentarily by weather, disease, diet, or other such factors. Research design must take this into consideration. To recapitulate, altering the environ- ment of a free-ranging group is a promising method to (1) elicit and identify the full range of behavioral and organizational phenotypes contained within a primate genotype, (2) compare the relative adap- tational values of phenotypic variations, (3) distinguish characteristics determined strictly by inheritance from traits that are modifiable in reaction to sudden de- mands for survival, and (4) explain the functional relationship of social behavior and social organization. Observations in the present study illustrate some of the general kinds of results obtainable from this approach, and suggest some ways to continue with more analytical research. The questions involved are much too com- plex to be answered by other than intensive, controlled field studies on nar- rowly defined objectives; but before such studies can succeed, we need clearer definitions of terms and criteria for the phenomena to be tested. In studying the effects of exposure to new or altered environment, results come from change, or lack of change, in social characteristics in response to the new situation. What constitutes a change? Environment and behavior normally vary within a certain range; how do we recognize and measure the subtle, covert variations extending beyond the normal range which may be responses to experi- mental variations? In saying that social organization or behavior has changed, a distinction is necessary between true change in a given characteristic, shown by differences in motor patterns, communi- cations, interactions, context of expression, and the mere substitution of one character- istic for another, the original being abandoned in the experimental situation and replaced by another which formerly was latent. The element of time must be considered. Criteria are necessary for the acceptable interval length between altering the en- vironment and the beginning of a response and for the duration of the process in completing the response. Responses due to illness, injury, maturation, and loss or gain of group members must be differentiated from changes resulting from environmental alteration. Can a response be temporary or must it be permanent? By the end of the third stage of adjustment in Group H, resump- tion of temporarily abandoned character- istics overshadowed retention of new ones, suggesting that conditions brought on after the treatment of July 1966 were not strong enough changes in the long run to over- come tradition. The temporary new forms of behavior and organization seemed necessary during their existence, but re- turning to former traits, after it became possible to do so, seemed to be a choice or irresistible tendency to retain character- istics learned in the socializing experiences of maturation. To permanently retain new traits, the force of stronger environmental change than was caused here may be necessary, or the experimental group may require several generations in the new situ- ation before traditional habits fade out and new ones are acquired. Another variable deserving consideration, especially in the case of rhesus living in circumstances similar to the overcrowded conditions at Cayo Santiago, is that a change in behavior or organization may not be necessary for survival in the new situ- ation, but is merely abandonment of a trait necessary for coping with a stress in the original setting. Judged anthropomorphi- cally, the stresses of competition and hos- tility at Cayo Santiago seemed worthy of abandonment at the first opportunity: com- 73</page><page sequence="72">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS petition at chow and feeding stations, receiving wounds, being attacked. In the final state of H at Desecheo, though, it appeared that a more relaxed, peaceful, uncoercive way of life gained during late 1966 and early 1967 was later relinquished to go back to the stress of discipline, organization, and male dominance despite the apparent absence of any environmental need for it. Influences on Reproduction Koford (1963, 1965) postulated that timing of the reproductive season at Cayo Santiago is regulated by the annual fluctu- ation of rainfall. He discounted seasonal changes of temperature or day length as controlling factors because temperature varies less than 10 C between summer and winter and day length varies but 130 min during the year. During the dry season from January to April, vegetation withers and leaves fall. Heavy rains in May and June induce much new growth of herbs, leaves, flowers and fruits, and create a nutritional augmentation to the diet of chow that may be the proximate factor in effecting the time of mating. The long- term records of rainfall at Cayo Santiago show annual totals ranging mostly between 150 and 200 cm, but reaching extremes of 100 and 250 cm in some years. The onset of mating each year begins when 60-75 cm of rain accumulates after 1 January. Mating begins in July or August, about 1-2 months after the start of the rainy season, and the incidence of conceptions peaks in September and October. In 1961, only 48 cm of rainfall accumulated by 30 June, and mating was delayed 1 month (Koford 1965). Free-ranging rhesus on islands near La Parguera in the arid southwest corner of Puerto Rico mate later in the year than do rhesus at Cayo Santiago (Vandenbergh and Vessey 1968). Timing of the annual mating season at La Parguera is attributed also to the influence of annual rainfall patterns. Desecheo's climate is similar to La Par- guera's, so it was anticipated that the mating season of monkeys sent to Desecheo would change to a later annual period. La Parguera rhesus colony was estab- lished in 1962, and in 1966 contained 189 monkeys. The original population began mating when released. In 1963, a birth season extended from March to November. In the years from 1964 through 1966, in- fants were born in March through August, with 74% in May and June (Vandenbergh and Vessey 1968). This annual peak period in May and June has continued to the present, placing the peak of conceptions in November and December of each year. Mating seasons at each colony thus begin at about the same interval length after their respective annual rainy seasons commence, and both the rainy season and peak of conception occur about 2 months later at La Parguera than at Cayo Santiago. Be- cause the climate at Desecheo is so similar to the climate at La Parguera, it seemed probable that the annual mating season in monkeys sent to Desecheo would become 2 months later in the year than at Cayo Santiago; and if proved so, it would sub- stantiate the hypothesis that timing of annual rainfall does regulate the timing of mating among the free-ranging rhesus mon- keys in Puerto Rico. The time of births in 1967 and 1968 at Desecheo suggested that mating had be- come later in the year, but the record of 1971 indicated that Desecheo infants were born in the Cayo Santiago schedule rather than in synchrony with births at La Par- guera. It is too soon to compare the sea- sons of reproduction on Desecheo with seasons at the other 2 colonies. So few infants have been recorded on Desecheo and their birth dates are known so inexactly that a statistical comparison with births at the other islands is impossible (Lancaster and Lee 1965). The mating season of 1966 among the Desecheo colonists probably was delayed until the end of the year because of stress from coping with the rigors of a harsher environment rather than because of cli- matic difference. By the time they were 74</page><page sequence="73">RHESUS MONKEY GROUP TRANSPLANTATION-Morrison, Menzel moved, they had already been exposed to 56 cm of rain accumulated after 1 January 1966, which according to Koford's (1963, 1965) hypothesis should have brought them close to physiological readiness to mate. The reproductive season of 1967- 1968 may have been delayed artificially, because of a drouth (Fig. 18) that affected all of Puerto Rico, rather than having been a normal acclimation to different climate. Records for Desecheo births in 1969 and 1970 are not available. The March birth season in 1971 indicated that mating in 1970 must have been preceded by suffi- cient rainfall to bring out the amount of food necessary to induce physiological readiness for reproduction. As noted in a previous section, vegetation was extremely luxuriant in May 1971, contrasting markedly with the denuded conditions of 1967 and 1968. La Parguera was still bar- ren and arid on 10 May 1971, and births had just started. Desecheo received total rainfall of 96 and 86 cm, respectively, in 1969-1970, whereas in 1966-1968, rainfall ranged from 59 to 74 cm annually (Fig. 18). The rainfall shown for Desecheo in Fig. 18 was recorded on Mona Island, 50 km southwest of Desecheo. Accurate records of births and rainfall on Desecheo are needed for several consecutive years before the reproductive season of its mon- keys can be evaluated with confidence. The annual pelage molt at both Cayo Santiago and La Parguera starts shortly after births commence and extends slightly beyond the end of the birth season (Vessey and Morrison 1970). At Desecheo, molt was delayed a few weeks in 1967, had not even started by May in 1968, and in 1971 was just beginning in May. No explanation can yet be given for this annual delay of molt, apparently occurring out of phase with the birth season, at Desecheo. Until we learn otherwise, it is best to assume that every aspect of social organi- zation is nonrandom and serves a biological function (Carpenter 1962, Menzel 1968). Individual members of rhesus monkey populations show close similarities in loco- motor patterns, manipulation of objects, vocalizations, gestures, and forms of inter- action. Groups of rhesus monkeys also have similarities of social behavior, repro- duction, and organization typical of the species. There are presumably adaptive reasons not only for this species predicta- bility but also for variability and departure from the norm by subpopulations (Jay 1968, Rowell 1967). No single undisturbed environment can reveal all functions of every behavior or every social structure, nor can it disclose all phenotypic modifications of which a given genotype is capable (Kummer 1967). By studying adjustments to change and the reestablishment of equilibria after dis- ruption, we can assess function and adap- tation. Experiments of some kind are essential to accomplish this. The present study reveals some of the results of altering the environment of a free-ranging social group. In a sense, it is analogous to studies of organ or tissue transplants. SUMMARY Two-thirds of a social group of 82 free- ranging rhesus monkeys were transplanted from Cayo Santiago to Desecheo Island, Puerto Rico, in July 1966 to observe the effect of changed environment on social organization and behavior. The original group ranked fourth in dominance among 7 groups totalling 682 animals. The 26 group members left behind retained co- hesion but dropped to lowest hierarchical rank; the 56 members sent to Desecheo were the only monkeys present. Cayo Santiago has 15 hectares, high rainfall, and dense vegetation. Desecheo has &gt; 122 hectares, low rainfall, and sparse vegetation. At Cayo Santiago, monkeys depended on commercial chow available from feeding stations. The residual group had much difficulty getting chow after decreasing in rank. They were harassed by other groups and kept from feeding stations. Group spread, dispersion, resting time, total range, travel, and play decreased; aggression and feeding time increased. The group became 75</page><page sequence="74">WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS more wary and hid much in dense cover. The former second-ranking adult male be- came group leader and fought much, with little help, in group defense. Eventually, 2 more adult males joined the leader and helped defend the group, and the group resumed original behavior and attitude but remained lowest in the dominance hier- archy. The larger group at Desecheo became more dispersed and increased its travel while foraging. Monkey chow was un- available and all had to find natural food. Intragroup aggression diminished. The dominant male of the original group was present but soon lost control and became passive. Other adult males did not be- come dominant for several months during which time typical organization was abandoned each day while all dissociated independently into small foraging parties. Juvenile play diminished and infants be- came unusually independent of their mothers. Females and offspring eventually formed 2 new groups which adult males then began to control as leaders. Both groups resumed the original condensed and coordinated form of organization. They travelled and foraged less, infant play re- turned, and intragroup aggression rose. Annual pelage molt occurs concurrently with the birth season at Cayo Santiago and at La Parguera. The birth season at La Parguera comes about 2 months later than Cayo Santiago each year, presumably be- cause of different rainfall patterns. Mon- keys at Desecheo seemed to retain the Cayo Santiago birth season, but their period of molt was later. LITERATURE CITED ALDRICH-BLAKE, F. P. G. 1970.
