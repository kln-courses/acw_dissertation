For the efficient pursuit of clean and simple objectives precludes any sort of multi- layered response to living, since such response would have to stand as patently counter-productive and directly inimical to efficiency. Hence, under PBTE, etc., the interests of aesthetic education would have to suffer dramati- cally. As primary content, the aesthetic (like other content) would be subject to considerable distortion; as "collatoral" content or dimension, the aesthetic concern would simply disappear altogether in the interests of reducing in- structional activity to its simplest, most manageable units. As a solution for education's ills, such atomism-with-a-vengence simply will not do. Rather, as the authors in this volume on "Regaining Educational Leadership" have successfully shown, it represents an approach to educational reform that is bankrupt from the start. Even before the evidence starts to come in (and, as they point out, precious little of it has), the very shape of the proposals makes it clear that they are far more likely to bring harm than good. This volume contributes a great deal to the understanding of exactly how and why that is the case. Mary Anne Raywid Hofstra University A HISTORY OF LITERARY AESTHETICS IN AMERICA by Max I. Baym. New York: Frederick Ungar, 1973, 388 pages, $14.50. "Literary aesthetics," Baym professes, "is primarily concerned with the cri- teria of beauty and pleasure in the creation and in the appreciation of literary works of art" (p. vii). With this in view he surveys the American quest for both a definition and an explication of the "aesthetic." The emphasis here is to be placed on "quest." The metaphysical condition of this questing is implicit in many of the seventeen chapters of the volume. It surfaces most openly in the last chapter (17) when Baym creates an overview of American scholarship and criticism. "Beauty," writes Baym, "is not a thing, but a process, forever subject to Heraclitean flow. It is a transcendental form of which each particular expression is reminiscent as shadow is of substance, as memory is of experience, and as desire itself is of fulfillment" (p. 291). This enthusiastic, often ecstatic, appraisal of American letters is elegantly written. And in acting upon his belief that "the aesthetic quest is itself a thing of beauty" (p. vii), Baym presents the reader with a wealth of refer- ences. The difficulty with most surveys of this kind is that the exigency of completing the historical record shortens what should take several volumes. Brief surveys do have their merits, nonetheless, and this particular one distin- guishes many of them. This monograph presents a synopsis of the diverse perspectives developed in the last two centuries of America's fascination with literature. Each chap- ter is devoted to a discussion of several contributors who have engaged in the search for aesthetic experience. A cross-section of the volume includes these titles: Early intimations of aesthetic sensibility (ch. 1), Tonalities of an implicit literary aesthetics (ch. 5), The scentific background of moder</page><page sequence="2">116 BOOK REVIEWS aesthetics (ch. 7), Criticism and aesthetics (ch. 10), Aesthetic analysis and the philosophic dimension of criticism (ch. 13), and Symbolism and other aesthetic tonalities (ch. 14). In the early chapters Baym links much of American thought with Europe and antiquity. His discussion of Edwards's implicit aesthetic theory establishes the tone of the volume. Edwards dis- covered the altered appearance of everything-"a calm, sweet cast, an appearance of divine glory in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds, and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, trees; in the water and all nature" (p. 7). One chapter noteworthy because of its array of lesser lights (John Bascom, George Comfort, Henry Day, John Steinfort Kedney et al.) is chapter six, "Concerted Efforts at an Aesthetic Structure (1860-90)." As Baym points out, these figures, however unknown, brought the subject of aesthetics respectably into our general education. They disclosed how beauty enters the mind through the senses and awoke students to the sensuous world about them. In the course of the volume, two philosophers, George Santayana and John Dewey, are accorded individual treatment (chs. 8, 12, respectively). In characterizing their positions, Baym highlights the fact that the aesthetics of literature must be seen in the context of larger aesthetic issues. Much of his commentary in the other chapters mirrors what he singles out in John Dewey. "Every genuine work of art," Baym explains, "transforms man's vision of himself and of his relationship to the world, constituting, in Arnold's phrase, a criticism of life in the highest sense" (pp. 192-93). Baym returns to this point in the final chapter. There he writes: "Every significant literary work is a criticism of life in which life is not merely reported but transformed through the process of logopoeia, phanopoeia, mythopoeia, and melopoeia" (p. 295). Fundamentally, it seems that Baym believes that life is a humdrum and disjointed affair which is in need of embellishment and coherence. Literature, in addition to the other fine arts, supplies what is "missing from life" (p. 298). In his commentary on Poe, he goes so far as to say that "a poem converts emotional chaos into a rhythmic, musical pattern, sublimating desire through expressive form. By releasing repression it becomes therapeutic, as Aristotle recognized" (p. 50, emphasis added). The presumptions with which Baym conducts this survey appear in many fashions. In sketching the position of Edgar Allen Poe, Baym states that a great service was rendered because Poe awakened the search for "the forces underlying artistic expression" (p. 53). In the all important final chapter (all important to an understanding of Baym's own perspective) the reader will find that these forces are "desire, love, birth, pain, wonderment, ambition, fulfillment, frustration, hope, despair, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, the comic and the tragic, the true and the false - life and death" (p. 294). In reminiscing on a 1920 course of Dewitt H. Parker, Baym states that "he communicated aesthetic ideas without the narrowly logical obfuscation that sometimes pervades more recent discussions of the subject. Matters of great moment were stated simply and explicitly. The subject was always man's abiding fascination for beauty" (p. 176). Subsequently, he is provoked by Weitz and responds: "Here I wish to add that open-faced confrontation of the facts of the human condition in the vast context of the cosmic swirl reduces the human comedy to a sentimental blink. It is precisely this blink,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 117 however, that affords us our sentimental education, which turns on such matters as beauty, drama, the grotesque, and musical moments in an aesthetic response that is constantly changing" (p. 243). It seems to this reviewer that these remarks approach being incursions into the history of aesthetics. The presence of the comment on Parker's lectures, particularly, casts a shadow on this otherwise praiseworthy edition. Completeness (not to mention fair play) should have required some documentation of this judgment. If a definite counter movement is present in American aesthetics, one which challenges the very way the craft is conducted, that is an important historical fact. These last comments are made with no intention of detracting from the gain to be secured from reading this volume. This is a welcome addition to the history of ideas, especially aesthetic ideas, in America. Clearly, aesthetic interests have been much as Baym reports. Increasingly, it has become evident that, however entwined with European tradition and metaphysical concerns, aesthetics here has developed a life and range of topics all its own. The fact that so much is tidily woven together without a denial of the distinct contri- butions of so many persons will leave the reader with a sense of where aesthetics in America has come from. James F. O'Leary Rosary Hill College, Buffalo MIND AND ART: AN ESSAY ON THE VARIETIES OF EXPRES- SION by Guy Sircello. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1972, xiii + 349 pp., $13.50. This philosophical investigation into the concept of expression is relevant, but not directly so to the concerns of aesthetic education. Its relevance arises from what it has to say about the nature of mind, and the fact that the author introduces his argument through a consideration of the treatment accorded the Expression Theory of Art by Beardsley, Bouwsma, et al. From the point of view of aesthetic theory the book is of interest in re-opening questions most aestheticians had regarded as laid to rest. From the perspective of philosophy of mind its interest would appear to stem from a de-emphasis of the con- scious, coupled with the introduction of arguments for what the author calls a "Romantic view," one which emphasizes the mind's "radical originality and irreducible internality" (p. 14). Teachers of art and art education cannot but be interested in the nature of mind, the relation between mind and art, and the use of language in criticism and the classroom. Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that the thrust of the book is from aesthetic ques- tions back toward more fundamental questions about the nature of mind, rather than forward to educational practice or theory. The view espoused by Beardsley and Bouwsma can be summarized in terms of the argument that a statement of the form "X is a sad symphony" can be reduced to the form, "X has such and such distinguishable features which can be referred to by the anthropomorphic predicate 'sad.'" "Sad" in "sad symphony" is metaphoric in a way that "sad" in "sad person" is not. For Beardsley and Bouwsma statements about expressive properties of works of art are to be treated as if they were disguised statements about "qualities"</page></plain_text>
