<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANDED ARISTOCRACY AND EDUCATION IN BIHAR TILL 1937 Rajesh Kumar* The second half of the 19th century witnessed the formal beginning of modern education in Bihar. The British policy of 'laissez faire' in educational sphere could not continue for long and with the growing need for cheap subordinate administrative staff they began to encour- age modern education in Bihar. However, it was not that the educa- tion progressed in Bihar in response to British needs and demands, as more and more people of Bihar began to realise the importance of education for their all round development. This paper seeks to examine the role of one particular class i.e. the landed aristocracy in promoting education in Bihar till 1937. We will try to evaluate their contributions by analysing various funds, do- nations, endowments for establishing schools and colleges as well as instituting scholarships and stipends for encouraging education. The discussion will also include their attitude towards higher education on national lines, and primary education. It is here we notice some contradictions in their encouragement and support to education. The second half of the 19th century witnessed sincere efforts made by British officials for the progress of education in Bihar. It was real- ised by the these officials that one of the basic reasons for aversion to modern education was the absence of adequate means of communica- tion between the government and the people through which such in- fluences could have been exercised. Moreover, it was all the more necessary that the zamindar's cooperation should be obtained by all means to achieve the desired end. Since the people were accustomed to look to the landlords for guidance, it was felt that only through the involvement of landed gentry could such influence be brought about. In the beginning the government was not keen to provide funds directly for the establishment of government colleges. It left the higher education mostly, if not entirely, in the hands of private enterprise. Although the first college in Bihar Patna College (Patna, 1863) was established by the government, it had to depend heavily on dona- tions and financial assistance of the landed aristocracy. Syeed Wallyat Ally Khan donated Rs. 5,000 to the college whereas donations of the Darbhanga Maharaj and the Bettiah estate amounted to Rs. 6,000 and ♦AM- 17364, New Delhi "</page><page sequence="2">Modem India 697 with the travails of the rural poor, and sympathised with the victims of malaria. Nevertheless, they need not necessarily reflect the authentic perceptions of the villagers always. Village literati might have rescued us from such constraints: liter- ary tracts originating from the villages had been more dependable, but such tracts do not come in abundance. Under such circumstances, oral tradition might arguably be nearer the ground. In this paper, a few conclusions have been drawn from oral evidence given basóme old people living in the villages under study. The most ancient of all theories regarding the cause of sickness was a result of the malign influence of supernatural power.1 These powers might be exercised by living persohs, e.g. witches, by the spir- its of the disembodied or by super-human entity. The concept was a part of the broad philosophy of anthropomorphism which read into all nature the irresponsibility and unpredictability of all human will. The animistic theory of diseases had its own logical therapeutic and preventive medicines. If the disease was supposed to be due to personalised anthropomorphic entities, one should obviously be able to influence the demonic personalities by propitiation through sacri- fice, by exorcism, or frightening the evil spirit through invocation of more powerful spiritual forces. It may be mentioned in passing that this fatalistic disposition was not peculiar to India. In medieval Europe, every Christian believed that life was not a lottery, but reflected the working-out of God's pur- poses. If things went wrong, he did not have to blame his luck but could be assured that God's hand was at work.2 The victim of misfor- tune would thus draw some stoical consolation from the belief that God was controlling his fate. He would reason with himself that some suffering was almost essential as proof that God retained an interest in him. Temporal afflictions were interpreted as signs of God's affec- tion.3 This fatalistic view of diseases seems to have been most com- monly invoked with reference either to general disease, or to epidem- ics when the scale of visitation cried out for explanation in terms of the sins of the whole or a particular section of the community. In modern times, medical scientists relate disease to mundane causes, and not to any supernatural intervention. Speaking about the constant challenge to human health in the tropics, recent scholars re- late it to the biological environment of human settlements.4 The mor- tality and morbidity in tropical countries, they argue, "is not racial, but environmental" for whenever "planned reforms are carried through improvement follow".5</page><page sequence="3">698 Modem India In India, however, ordinary people of the countryside were not so amenable to reason. In an account of an Indian village life in Hyderabad State, an anthropologist found illness related to the ritual structure of Hindu life6. It emphasises that the punctilious observance of the ritual cycle of festivals leads to the prosperity of the family. Most of the common diseases, the anthropologist found, are interpreted as a "fault in the physical system", and are treated with herbal medicine or mod- ern drugs obtained from the dispensary. However, persistent headache, intermittent fever, repeated abortion etc. are attributed to supernatural forces. Small pox, cholera and plague are always attributed to the wrath of various goddesses, and for these diseases worship is regarded as the only remedy7. Another anthropologist who has worked in North India argues that many standard rites are in fact precautionary cer- emonies in which a deity is regularly honoured so that he will bear his worshippers' goodwill.8 Bengal does not seem to have been an exception. When the wide- spread malaria epidemic started taking its toll in the sixties of the nineteenth century, popular reaction did not sharply differ from that of other parts of the country. In fact, the identification of epidemic disease with divine wrath was almost a pan-Indian phenomenon. It took the distinctive form of belief in disease deities, especially god- desses. Hindu society, David Arnold argues, did not regard all dis- eases alike. Some were seen as the consequences of personal sins, whereas others were looked upon as results of sorcery. But epidemic diseases, due to their scale and nature, and the general ineffectiveness of conventional medicine against them, were readily identified with the wrath of gods and cosmic disharmony.9 Most of the disease goddesses were associated with a particular disease or ailment. In Bengal, the worship of Sitala was timed to coin- cide with the beginning of the small-pox season.10 In deltaic Bengal, the specific cholera deity was called Ola Bibi by the Muslims, and Olai Ghandi by the Hindus.11 But the most interesting phenomenon was that scarcely did the people interpret epidemic fever as heavenly intervention, and consequently one finds no folk-deity for fever epi- demic, except the cult of 'Jwarasura' prevalent among the lower classes. 'Jwarasura' i.e., the fever demon, was invoked in individual cases to recover from fever, and by the villagers generally during epi- demics of malarial fever.12 He was worshipped by the lower castes with the aid of a Brahmin. Besides the usual offerings of rice, sweets and fruits, goats were sacrificed in special instances. But 'Jwarasura' seemed to have no following among the upper caste Hindus or well- to-do villagers. For nowhere in the contemporary literary works, or in</page><page sequence="4">Modem India 699 the official records could one find reference to a widespread worship of this particular deity. In other words, this disease deity, unlike Sitala or Ola Bibi , never became a cult in Bengali society. This provides an interesting exception to Arnold's general observation that almost all epidemic in India is associated with a particular disease deity.13 This calls for an explanation. The reason is two-fold and can be explained by a lack of indig- enous immunity, and the exceptional geographical range. The causes of malaria and quinine, its remedial herbal, were a later date inven- tion, until then, people sought solace in the popular adage: "which cannot be ended should be mended", and which could not be even mended should be accommodated in their regular pattern of life.14 Moreover, malarial fever might be remittent or intermittent; it abated at intervals. Its nature of periodic invasion provided reasonable res- pite from fever, and minimized its awe to some extent. Besides, this type of ailment was not unknown to the people. The ailment had ac- companied them from cradle to coffin through Darwinian descent. In this process the disease lost much of its shock element. Malaria became an all-India disease in the period under review. In Bengal, few districts escaped its ravages. The epidemic lost its edge due to its widespread spatial expansion. The epidemic became almost a national phenomenon, visiting various places at various times. It was not an individual ailment afflicting a person or two. Thus the element of fear disappeared, and instead there was a helpless resigna- tion to conventional treatment. Arguably therefore the epidemic was scarcely considered a divine displeasure and consequently worship or propitiation of a particular god was ruled out. On the contrary, people accused the colonial government of arbi- trary interference with the river system in Bengal which, they believed, had helped bring about the epidemic. In Howrah district, for instance, people complained of government measures which caused floods in the region from Munsir Hat station to Panpur adjacent to Howrah- Amta railways.15 Such alleged high-handedness of the officials never went unprotested. People in the affected villages, particularly in Jessore, were up in arms when the government officials approached the vil- lages with their men to execute Government orders. Officials entrusted with the unpleasant task had to beat a hasty retreat. They reported back that "the villagers have displayed much apathy to their own wel- fare, and in some cases, have even offered resistance to measures solely adopted for their benefit"16</page><page sequence="5">700 Modem India The officials encountered similar resistance from villagers when the Government opened langarkhana i.e., gruel kitchen in the imme- diate vicinity of the affected villages. When the government intro- duced a relief-house first at Burdwan, people opposed the system of giving cooked food for religious reasons, and sarcastically called it 'hotel'.17 The Hindus certainly did not approve of cooked food being distributed; especially the upper caste Hindus thought it preposterous to join the crowd of aim-receivers. Official dispatches show that women and children of humble origin formed the majority of the crowd, and that the grown up men of respectable families avoided their company." The Government, however, seemed to have faced no difficulty with the Muslims. At least at one depot at Nilpur the people who received relief were almost all Muslims. They had no inhibitions about receiv- ing cooked food." Opposition to sanitation measures in terms of cutting of trees was discernible. Opposition to the provision of relief land, about SO square mile expansion, came to be known as Kedor Jala as the place that remained submerged in water for most part of the year. Previously it was not so, and cultivators used to reap a bumper crop of paddy each year. But the railway embankment, the inhabitants alleged, had con- verted this fertile land into a perpetual swamp. Earlier, the land had sloped downwards from North to South, and the silt waters of Damodar and Madaria Khal used to collect in the area. As a result, the region was elevated. But due to the railway embankment the silt was depos- ited right on the western side of Kedo in the Damodar, and it was observed that the river bed had been raised at least ten feet above the Kedor Jala. The area witnessed a recurrent outbreak of malaria. The Government, the people complained, was in no mood to adopt effec- tive measures to drain out the Damodar waters. Though the people lamented over the acts of omission, they pro- tested against the ruler's acts of commission as well. Dispatches from rural bureaucracy pleaded for cutting of superfluous jungles and pre- vention of their growth in close proximity to dwelling houses. It was observed that many of the affected villages were particularly over- grown with tangled vegetation. The measures were well-intentioned, for they were aimed at promoting public health but in its zeal for do- ing good to the people, the government officials resorted to measures which virtually denuded the villages of their greenery. They chopped off branches, trimmed the shrubs and worst of all, uprooted the larger trees, particularly the fruit bearing ones. Regarding another measure, opposition to government dispehsa- ries was seldom noticed. The government opened up fever hospitals</page><page sequence="6">Modem India 70 1 and dispensaries in the affected districts which provided quinine free of cost to the ailing villagers. :.i the beginning, most of the institu- tions were somewhat unpopular owing to the apathy, neglect, irregu- lar attendance and indifferent treatment of the sub-assistant surgeons.20 Gradually, however, these dispensaries became popular, and an in- creasing number of patients started attending the outdoor departments. Many of them certainly complained that the government medicines were useless. There were even complaints that the sub-assistant sur- geons were taking fees.21 The government, however, tried to get rid of the erring doctors, and the dispensaries gradually proved to be popular. Evidence of dis- pensary dispatches show that there was a large increase in the total number of indoor and outdoor patients treated which amounted to 46,127 in 1886.22 The statistics of the hospitals in Calcutta and in the amalgamated portion of its suburbs in Howrah show that the attend- ance increased with regard to the outdoor patients - the figure being 2,08,073 in 1890. There was also a very large increase in the number of outdoor patients treated at the Medical College Hospital, and the Principal attributed this to the unhealthiness during the year as well as the increased popularity of the institutions.23 The intensity of malarial fever and the consequent hospitalisation of the affected population thus evoked little or no resistance on the part of the masses. This stood out in sharp contrast to the phenom- enon of plague epidemic in Bombay. The physical examination of trav- ellers and the residents of plague-struck towns and cities where hos- pitalisation and segregation caused tremendous alarm among the masses, and they opposed the measures tooth and nail.24 Because most of the inspection doctors were male as well as European mere touch- ing by them was considered either polluting or tantamount to sexual molestation, particularly when it involved the examination of wom- en's necks, armpits, and thighs. Nothing of the sort happened in Bengal, however, when initially the Company and then the Crown resorted to a very effective segregative social for mitigating malarial fever by way of internment in hospitals and doling out Western medicines through public distri- bution systems such as dispensaries or post-offices. The explanation may be two-fold. In the case of plague, the people considered it as an expression of Divine wrath. The Indians saw the plague as a form of Divine punishment, a visitation against which the use of Western medi- cine was bound to be either impious or ineffective.25 Malaria, unlike the plague, was never interpreted as a divine intervention, far less a punishment by the heavenly hand. In the popular mind its virulence</page><page sequence="7">702 Modem India was associated with the baneful effects of British policy. As such, the common sentiment was that since the malaria in the epidemic form came in the wake of colonial rule, none but the government should come forward with generous aid. They did not oppose the Western medicines; instead they even pleaded for the setting up of more dis- pensaries and still larger amount of quinine supply. Secondly, effective treatment of malarial fever with indigenous medicine proved ineffective. Dr. Elliot reported that hundreds died without any treatment at all. In many cases, death was hastened by "injudicious treatment from ignorant and unqualified native practi- tioners"26. Dr. Thompson arg,ued$hat the mortality was much increased by the treatment of the Kabirajas . Thus the people increasingly lost faith in Kabiraji treatment. At the same time, the efficacy of Euro- pean medicines, contrasted with the trade and uncertain cures under the native system, was admitted by the masses. Under such circum- stances, the question of opposition to Western medicine was ruled out. Nevertheless, when the first case of epidemic fever occurred in Bengal, its inhabitants were filled with dismay, and though initially the case did not prove so fatal, the consternation of the people did not diminish. Gradually, however, the fever travelled from one end of the district to the other, killing some and leaving others shattered in health.27 People had never seen so many people die in their villages. Funeral processions, with the ritual chanting of Hari stalked the coun- tryside everyday. The funeral pyres at the burning ghats were not put out; when the remains of one man were reduced to ashes, those of another were ready for cremation. Elderly inhabitants confessed that they had never seen such a dreadful visitation. From nearly every house the cry of lamentation could be heard.28 Only when the government began sending out native practitioners, trained in the use of Western medicine and opening up charitable dispensaries, did the popular con- sternation gradually subside.29 Available evidence suggests that the poor peasant families refused to move out of their homesteads to other healthier districts even in the period of high malaria mortality. Government officials argued that nothing could induce the villagers to desert their family residences and the bhadrasanbati , in which were installed the family deities, and which were supposedly, guarded by the spirits of their deceased an- cestors.30 Migration to healthier places, particularly to Calcutta, the capital city, was, however, common among well-to-do families, especially the zamindars. The attitude of the better-off peasants and wealthy influential to the fever epidemic was pragmatic, and the methods they</page><page sequence="8">Modern India 703 evolved to circumvent it were practical. They were not fatalists, and did not worship the Jwarasura either. They used to call on the village vaidyas or kabirajas , failing which they looked for better cures. They could also call on the government dispensaries attended by Native Doctors practising Western medicine. As a last resort, they left the affected village for good and settled in the city.31 A few tentative conclusions can be drawn from these instances. Reaction to epidemic malaria from different sections of Bengali soci- ety offers a mixed and complex pattern. This complexity stems from widely differing perceptions about the general nature of an epidemic. So far as epidemic fever was concerned, the response of the masses was one of stoic acceptance, not dreaded repulsion. Popular reaction to the attitude of the Government, however, hardened in course of time. It followed a uniform pattern everywhere with marginal varia- tions. Almost all sections of the rural society raised their accusing fingers at the colonial government. The only difference was that the accusation was some times violent, some times muted.
