<plain_text><page sequence="1">■ Charles Andrew Ho fling UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI Marking Space and Time in Itzaj Maya Narrative Cyclicity has been noted as a key feature of Mayan conceptions of time and space from the Classic period (A.D. 250-900) to the present. Similarly, patterns of repetition and cyclicity have been noted as characteristic of Mayan discourse structure. In this article cyclicity in worldview and in discourse structure is examined in Itzaj Maya narrative, with emphasis on the impor- tance of the schema of the sun's journey to both. Introduction Time and Space among the Maya The prominence of cyclic time in Mayan worldview has been widely reported by archaeologists and ethnologists. Cyclicity and repetition in general have also been noted as characteristics of Mayan discourse struc- ture, reflected in couplets and other linguistic parallelisms. In this article I intend to show that cyclicity in cosmology and in discourse structure are systematically related in modern Itzaj Maya narrative.1 The Classic Maya (A.D. 250-900) had an extraordinarily rich conception of cyclic time, with the day (k'iri) as its most basic unit. Days are specified in the 260-day sacred-calendar cycle, in the 365-day solar-calendar cycle, in a 9-day cycle of lords of the night, in the long count of days elapsed since the beginning of the present creation, in lunar cycles, in eclipse cycles, in Venus cycles, in K'atun (20-year) cycles, and more (Aveni 1980, 1989; Edmonson 1988; León-Portilla 1988; Schele and Freidel 1990; Thompson 1971). Moreover, time units are ruled by deities, many of whom have astronomical identities. The sun god, the moon goddess, and Venus are Journal of Linguistic Anthropology 3(2):164-184.

Most deities are anthropomorphic and live in houses like everyone else. The progression of time is linked to the movement of celestial bodies across the heavens. Time's passage is equated to a god's journey. Thus, the dimensions of time and space are tightly bound. The end of a cycle brings one back to its beginning, just as the end of a journey brings one back home. For example, the sun god's journey takes him from the east at sunrise, up over the earth during the day to descend in the west at night. His journey continues beneath the earth through the watery underworld at night only to begin again in the east the next day. Scheie has recently proposed that Mayan creation mythology is also astronomically grounded (1992). In the Classic Mayan landscape, certain features are especially prominent (Coggins 1980, 1982; Scheie and Freidel 1990). Sacred places include special hills and their man-made counterparts, temple pyramids. The temple atop the pyramid, modeled after common houses, is a sacred house. In the forest, certain trees are sacred. Caves and bodies of water also are holy places, apparent links between this world and a divine one. By crossing bodies of water or by entering caves, divine dwellings, one might be transported to another world. There has been considerable debate about whether or not the Classic Mayan world is divided into cardinal directions, or whether zenith and nadir replace north and south, respectively (Ashmore 1989, 1991; Bricker 1983, 1988a; Closs 1988a, 1988b; Coggins 1980, 1988; León-Portilla 1988; Stross 1991; Watanabe 1983). It appears likely that both systems were in use, as León-Portilla and Stross suggest, with strong associations between north and zenith and between south and nadir. By shifting the vertical plane marked by the sun's path 90 degrees, zenith becomes north and nadir becomes south. In either system, the center is also a prominent locus. Directions (including the center) are associated with divinities, trees, winds, hills, and colors, a cosmic template also reflected in the colonial Yucatec books of Chilam Balam (e.g., the Chilam Balam ofChumayel [Edmon- son 1986; Roys 1967]). This cosmogram appears to have motivated site planning and provided a model for social and political relations both within and among Mayan settlements from Classic times onward (Ash- more 1991; Gossen 1975; Jones 1992; Marcus 1976). A striking fact of both the archaeological and ethnographic record is the continuity and consistency of basic cosmological notions across time and space. The primary ordering principle of the sun's journey accross the heavens and the cyclicity of time is evident not only in the pre-Classic lowlands (Freidel 1988; Hammond 1987; Justeson et al. 1988) but also among living groups throughout the Mayan area and beyond. Ethnogra- phers and linguists of modern Mayan communities have repeatedly docu- mented similar systems of belief (Bricker 1981; Farriss 1987; Fought 1985; Gossen 1975; Hanks 1984; 1990; León-Portilla 1988; Love and Castillo 1984; Neuenswander 1981; Sosa 1984, 1989; B. Tedlock 1982; Watanabe 1983). Indeed, much of this cosmology may be pan-Mesoamerican or even of wider distribution.</page><page sequence="3">1 66 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology Historical and Cultural Context Itzaj is a dying language, currently spoken by perhaps two or three dozen older adults, primarily men, in and around San José, Petén on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá. A repressive language policy in the 1930s abruptly and effectively interrupted intergenerational transmission of the language. Despite their small numbers, the Itzaj are proud of their heritage and are currently engaged in efforts to revitalize their language and culture. The Itzaj Maya were the last major Mayan polity to be overwhelmed by the Spanish (Jones 1989, 1992; Schwartz 1990). They maintained their capital of Tayasal (present day Flores) and controlled the Lake Petén Itzá region until 1697, a century and a half after the Spanish took power in the surrounding territories. As Jones has recently shown (1992), the site organi- zation of Tayasal reflected the general Mayan template described above, bèing divided into four directionally oriented quadrants, each associated with a major lineage. The site plan of Tayasal, in turn, modeled sociopol- itical relations in the general area of Lake Petén Itzá, which was also divided into quadrants, each controlled by the corresponding major lineage. After the Spanish invasion, the Itzaj suffered terribly and only small groups survived into the 20th century. Whether or not it was intentional, the layout of modern San José corresponds well to the general Mayan model. Its major axis is east-west along the lakeshore, with the hillside rising to the north and the lake extending to the south and east. A road also runs along the north-south axis from the town hall on the lake shore up to the alcaldía, bisecting the town. While rapid cultural change continues, San José has been relatively isolated geographically and conservative culturally (Höfling 1991; Schwartz 1990). The surviving speakers of Itzaj have witnessed remarkable cultural transformations, but the men have themselves been slash-and- burn agriculturalists who have participated in traditional cultural practices (Reina and Schwartz 1974; Schumann 1971; Soza 1970). All are intimately familiar with Lake Petén Itzá and the surrounding tropical forest. A usual means of transportation to the forest and the milpa is by dugout canoe, paddling east along the shore at dawn and returning to town in the late afternoon. The celebration of All Souls' Day is the major ritual event of the year in San José (Reina 1962). The highlight of the celebration is a procession beginning at the church ( k'u-naj 'god-house'), which is built at the top of a hill. Three skulls of Itzaj ancestors are housed within the church, and each year one of them is brought out in a procession, forming a three-year cycle. The procession begins at about midnight and goes on a circuit through the town to selected houses where first the skull is offered a ritual meal and then the members of the procession are fed. The procession returns to the church and concludes shortly before dawn. There are strong parallels between the procession's path and the sun's nightly journey through the underworld. Ritual circuits in highland Mayan ceremonies similarly model the sun's journey (Gossen 1975).</page><page sequence="4">Itzaj Maya Narrative 167 The solar cycles of the day, the seasons, and the year contìnue to structure the rhythm of daily life. Moreover, there is a pervasive isomorphism between cyclic patterns in cosmology and cyclic patterns in discourse. That is to say, distinctive cyclic patterns pervade Itzaj language and culture. Itzaj Maya Discourse Itzaj Maya discourse, like that of other Mayan languages, reflects a rich oral tradition based on dialogic verbal performance (Brody 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, in press; Hanks 1989, 1990; D. Tedlock 1983, 1985). Repetition and other linguistic parallelisms are prominent features in all discourse genres that have been recorded. The corpus analyzed in this study is composed of about two thousand lines of men's narrative including tales of personal experience as well as traditional folktales recorded in San José, Petén, between 1979 and 1988 (Höfling 1991). Narratives of personal experience differ from folktales in their frequent references to the speaker with first-person pronouns, in the speakeťs assertions that the narrated events truly occurred and were personally witnessed, and in their more variable text structure. Folktales are relatively formulaic, generally beginning with a standard formula that signals time reference in the distant past, and they may have elaborate thematic struc- tures with formally marked episodes, stanzas, and a final précis. The events described are believed to be true, but are signaled by the reportative marker (Vin) rather than claimed as personal experience. In both genres linguistic parallelism is frequent, and in both, the events described tend to appear in their natural chronological order. Themes of Itzaj Narrative Discourse A number of ancient themes appear in traditional narrative texts. For example, texts relate a famed deer hunter's encounter with the lord or guardian of the deer in a cave at the base of a hill; two mythic brothers' encounter with a strange feline beast while on a bird-hunting trip; a shaman's successful efforts to control still other strange felines that live in a cave at the base of a hill; another hunter's encounter with a hungry jaguar in the forest; and the story of a faithful husband who is buried alive with his wife after she dies, revives her, and chases her across the sea when she runs off with a stranger. In virtually every tale a human makes a journey in which fantastic creatures are encountered or otherwise unusual events take place. One might suppose that these fantastic elements are distinctive of mythic narrative, but they are not. Living narrators have had their fair share of strange experiences in the forest, including contacts with the lord of the deer. Fernando Tesucún, my primary consultant, was very nearly dragged from his front doorstep by Ix Tab' ay, a ghoulish enchantress with a special fondness for intoxicated men. It is distinctive of mythic narratives that they occur in the distant past and are not witnessed by the narrator. Living</page><page sequence="5">168 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology narrators have equally fantastic tales of personal experiences to relate, though of course, they also talk about more mundane topics. In personal narrative, as in mythic narrative, journeys are predominant. Moreover, these journeys begin and end in the house of the narrator. The world as reflected in these narratives is centered at one's home, which is a safe and familiar place. Journeys out of town into the forest are potentially dangerous, where strange things can and do happen. One is generally glad to return to the safety and comfort of home. Night also is a dangerous time, best spent behind closed doors (Reina 1962). I conclude that the journey is a major schema for narrative genres. This is also evident in oral traditions of other Mayan languages, the K'iche' Popol Vuh being the most famous example (D. Tedlock 1985). The journey of the sun across the heavens is a protoype of this schema. Linguistic Mechanisms Semiotic Overview The primary image of the sun's journey along its path underlies the cyclic principles that pervade Mayan cosmology in general and Itzaj discourse in particular. The journey of the sun provides a parallel structure to the journey of the protagonist, and references to the sun's movements and positions index time's passage. From what has been said above, it should be clear that schemata associ- ated with Mayan cosmology are reflected in many cultural practices in addition to discourse practices. However, the presence of these schemata is especially accessible in discourse, where temporal and spatial relations are linguistically coded at a range of linguistic levels from the morphologi- cal level up to the highest levels of discourse organization. Moreover, there are homologies of these codings among levels creating a dense layering of parallelisms (Brody 1990) and suggesting a pervasive set of analogies among structural levels (Friedrich 1991). For example, couplets, which are basic cyclic units of parallel lines in Mayan discourse, form larger structural units of stanzas and episodes, which simultaneously encode temporal cycles (e.g., the passage of days) and spatial cycles (e.g., journeys). This suggests that approaches that cross- cut linguistic levels and cultural domains such as markedness theory (with the concept of markedness asssimilation) in a more general semiotic/cog- nitive framework would be fruitful (e.g., Battistella 1990; Friedrich 1986, 1989, 1991; Givón 1989; Langacker 1991; Pinto 1989; Shapiro 1983). This explication of Itzaj discourse will begin with the higher levels of discourse organization and will work down to the lower levels of morphosyntax. There are standardized formats for Mayan narrative discourse that typi- cally include an orientation to the discourse world, episodes in the main body of the narrative, a summarizing recapitulation, and a closing (Martin 1990). In the very structure of the tale, one may observe the cyclic principle, as the completion of the tale involves an abbreviated repetition of the story in the recapitulation.</page><page sequence="6">Itzaj Maya Narrative 169 In telling a story, the narrator invariably makes reference to the passage of time. There is a natural iconidty of the temporal sequence of the events described and the order in which they are presented in the narrative. Also of interest are the ways in which the narrator manipulates the audience's expectations and perceptions of the passage of time by the way in which he or she talks about it. As mentioned above, a common theme of narrative is the fantastic experience. One fantastic aspect of these experiences is that temporal order is distorted. For example, a hunter thinks he has been away for a day when in fact he has been lost for three months. Similarly, a good storyteller is able to affect the audience's perception of time, speeding it up and slowing it down, building to a climax and lingering there, making time stand still. Itzaj Discourse Structure Initial Orientation. Almost invariably, the initial orientation of a nar- rative grounds it in time and space in relation to the present of the discourse situation, as in examples (l)-(4).2 (1) [1:1] Jo'lej-ij, tal-ij im-b'al yesterday-3sg come-3sg lsgPpr-brother-in-law Yesterday my brother-in-law came (to my house) (2) [2:1-2] Jum p'e kin . . . domiingo . . . one INAM day Sunday One Sunday jok'-een ti tz' on. leave-lsg SUB shoot I went out (from my house) to shoot.

In (l)-(3), which are from personal narratives, temporal-focus constructions appear, with the temporal adverb appearing initially.4 In these examples, the implicit center or reference location is the speaker's house. In (4), from a mythic narrative, we have a formulaic opening first locating the story in the distant past in the speaker's town and then indexing a particular day. Compare (2) and (4), which both mention hunting trips, and note that, in both, verbs of motion away from the locational reference point in the speaker's house or town signal the beginning of a journey. Closing Orientation. Similarly, at the end of a narrative, closing orien- tations of time and space appear. In (5), as the story draws to a close, there is explicit mention of time and location first within the discourse world of the story (dawn at home) and then in relation to the discourse world of the current narrator and the audience (afternoon at the same home).

Cyclic principles are in evidence in several ways as narratives draw to a close. Because most of these narratives involve journeys, the main protago- nist usually returns home in the final scene, completing a spatial circle. Verbs of motion are again extremely important in the event line of the narrative, here marking motion toward the home center. There is fre- quently a repetition of the plot in a recapitulation statement, and there may be an implicit comparison between references to the story time and place (e.g., the k'in 'day') and to the time and place of utterance, as in (5). Also as in (5), there are frequently parallels between the end of the protagonist's journey in the discourse and the end of the narrator's discourse itself.6 It is noteworthy that the narrator concludes by stating that the journey just described is one that will not be repeated. Examples (6) and (7) are typical folktale closings, which are similar to personal narrative in structure but are more elaborate.

In (6), after a mythic canoe journey to Jobon Pich (a hill on the north shore of the lake) ends back in San José, the narrator formally ends the story in a series of parallel lines contrasting the mythic time and place with that of the present. Example (7) is taken from a story of a legendary deer hunter. After he returns home, there is an extended comparison of time frames between what he had believed was one day and what his wife informs him has been three months, between story time and time of narration, and between times of narration (the narrator notes that his grandmother had told the story to him when he was very young), all ending in the here and now of the speakeťs house. Scene Boundaries . Lexical time references are not restricted to the open- ing and closing of the narrative. In fact, episode (or smaller discourse-unit) boundaries are frequently marked by mention of the passage of time and with motion verbs as in (8M10).</page><page sequence="10">Itzaj Maya Narrative 173 (8) [10:115] li b'ay-to' ka' ok-ij Kin-ej and thus-DIST when enter-3sg sun-TOP And thus when the sun set, ka' wen-een. then sleep-lsg then I slept.

In (8) the end of a scene is marked by the parallel of the sun setting and the man sleeping. Motion verbs often enter into parallel constructions, in which the first member indexes motion away from the current scene and the second member motion toward the locus of the new scene, as in (10). As suggested in examples (8M10), discourse boundaries may be marked both by the movements of the characters and by the movements of time, that is, the sun (k!vn). In these examples, time (k'in) appears as the subject of verbs of motion. The parallel of human motion and solar/temporal motion is especially highlighted in couplet structures in (9) and (10). Here there is also clear iconicity of the passage of time with the cyclic motion of the sun. (In (9), marked by two couplets with the sun as subject, the reference is to a time interval of seven years, while in (10), marked by one couplet, it is much less.) Note too that, just as verbs of motion with human actors are paired with the first element to indicate motion away from center and with the second element to indicate motion toward center, the sun first moves away (with man 'pass') and then moves toward the center (with tal 'come'). The description of the sun's movement as first away from and then toward the center suggests that observations are with reference to the zenith passage and the general cosmological center. Journeys Follow Regular Paths Another general feature of the journey schema evident in these texts is that travelers follow known paths and that motion is directionally oriented along a single axis, forward or backward, away from home or toward it. A correlate of this regularity is that most journeys are repeated, just as the sun runs its course, the farmer takes the trip to his milpa, or the hunter to the forest. Repeated action may be grammatically marked by the repetitive marker ka'- prefixed to the verb root. Since the regularity of the journey is expected, the lack of repetition often becomes noteworthy.

The lines in (12) are from a mythic tale of a hunting trip in which one brother is transformed into a lion. After his transformation he openly laments that he will be unable to make the return trip home with his human brother (lines 117-21), but the urgency of the beast's hunger overwhelms him and he soon tries to overtake his sibling. In (13) the lord of the deer warns a hunter that he is lucky to be able to return home again rather than be forced to remain in the other world. Morphosyntax: Aspect and Locative Deixis Temporal and spatial reference, of course, can be made without lexical mention. Both can be signaled by grammatical morphemes, and indeed, Yucatecan languages are well known for their elaborate tense/aspect and deictic systems (Hanks 1990). A major distinction in tense/aspect, which</page><page sequence="13">1 76 ]ou mal of Linguistic Anthropology pervades verbal morphosyntax, exists between the completive aspect (sig- naling past tense or completed action) and the subjunctive (irrealis) on the one hand, which are marked ergatively, and the noncompletive aspects (most commonly with present time reference) on the other, which are marked accusatively (Höfling 1984, 1989b, 1991). Distinctive temporal adverbial particles also appear with each tense/ aspectual set. The adver- bial ka', variously glossed as 'then' or 'when', occurs with verbs in the completive aspect or subjunctive mood, while the temporal adverb kil 'when' occurs in noncompletive aspects. Thus ka' marks temporal distance from the present or discourse center. It should also be noted that a number of aspectual markers derive from verbs of motion and that aspectual information is often carried by verbs of motion in complex constructions (Höfling 1989b). In narrative discourse, the distinction between completive and noncom- pletive aspects roughly correlates to informational status. Highlighted main events are in the completive aspect, and supplementary background or subordinate information tends to be in noncompletive aspects. The contrast of "on the event line" versus "off the event line" shows a stronger correlation with aspect than does the grammatical one of main versus subordinate clause (Höfling 1989b). Information on the event line is typi- cally marked by the adverbial ka' 'then' and the completive aspect. Other conjunctions (e.g., i 'and') do not signal the event line but may be used for topic shift or focus constructions (Höfling 1987). Often among the supple- mentary information off the event line is direct discourse or quotation, including internal monologue, in which noncompletive aspects and proxi- mal deictics predominate, as in (14)-(15).

In examples (14) and (15) there is a common pattern in which direct discourse in noncompletive aspects appears at the end of a scene, followed by a mainline event signaling a scene shift, marked by ka' and the com- pletive aspect. Thus, aspectual marking is closely linked to the larger discourse units of scene and episode.7 A related pattern is reflected in the use of locative deictics. In setting the scene, full prepositional phrases are used, but once established, an ana- phoric deictic may appear as shown in (16) and (17).

Narrative time can be slowed down to roughly the equivalent of real time, marked by direct discourse and a high incidence of proximal deictics marking the immediacy of the situation and invoking comparisons with the time of utterance, or things can be sped up with a series of completive mainline events, as in a summarizing statement. Polanyi and Martin report a similar interaction of direct discourse and mainline events in Mocho (Mayan) (1990). In virtually all of the Itzaj narratives, direct discourse, or either of the related phenom- ena of thinking aloud and recording thoughts, is juxtaposed to mainline events. Conclusion Cyclic repetition is a pervasive structural element from the highest level of Itzaj Maya discourse structure down to at least the morphemic level.8 Parallelisms occurring at different structural levels are used for a variety of purposes and invite a complex set of comparisons. It is shown that the journey is a basic schema in narratives, with the sun's journey as a prototype. Discourse is oriented toward one's (or a protago- nist's) house in one's town, over which the sun makes its daily journey. The journey of the protagonist is paralleled by the journey of time, that is, by the journey of the sun. As the narrative draws to a close, the completion of the journey is marked by a return home and a final shift from the time of story to the narrator's present. The landscape of the journeys is both familiar and strange. Unusual things happen at or near known landmarks as the sun follows its ceaseless course. Caves at the bases of hills and trips across bodies of water and into the forest, while commonplace, can be dangerous. As the journey pro- gresses, scene and episode boundaries are punctuated by linguistic repeti- tions in the form of couplets or larger scale parallelisms and a slowing of tempo followed by a rapid shift in time and /or space. Cycles involve everything from macrothematic elements down to the morphosyntactic marking of tense/aspect, resulting in a dense texture suggesting elaborate equivalences at different levels within the discourse world and between the discourse world and the world of the discourse participants (narrator and audience). It is noted in passing that the discourse universe reflected in modern Itzaj texts is remarkably similar to that reflected in hieroglyphic writing a millenium earlier. An intriguing aspect of Mayan cyclicity is that it is such a very old and enduring pattern. This is a pattern that has lasted through the rise of Mayan civilization, its political dissolution, the Spanish invasion, and the succeeding political domination. In the case of Itzaj, a dying language, it has survived even after entire genres and registers have disappeared. It is as deeply embedded in the language and culture matrix as one can go. Looked at in a slightly different light, it is clearly a very adaptable conceptual system able to adjust to the very different circum- stances in which the Itzajs have found themselves.</page><page sequence="16">Itzaj Maya Narrative 179 Notes Acknowledgments. An earlier version of this article was presented at the 1991 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in Chicago. This research has been supported by a Fulbright Fellowship (1979-80), a University of Kentucky Summer Faculty Research Fellowship (1988), and NSF Grant BNS- 9009259 (1991-93). I owe a special debt to Fernando Tesucún, my primary linguistic consultant. I am also grateful to Ben G. Blount, Joseph F. Foster, Paul Friedrich, Rhoda Halperin, Laura Martin, Lin Poyer, and four anonymous reviewers for their comments on an earlier draft of this article. 1. Itzaj Maya is a member of the Yucatecan Maya family and is currently spoken by a small number of older adults in and around San José, Petén, Guatemala. Itzaj is the spelling currently favored by the remaining speakers, rather than Itza ', Itza, or Itza. 2. In the examples, the numbers in brackets refer to text number followed by line number as they appear in Höfling 1991. Texts numbered (1M11) are narratives of personal experience, while those numbered (12) and over are folktales. The exam- ples are in the official orthography approved by the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages. The following abbreviations are used: , short pause (less than 0.7 seconds) long pause (greater than 0.7 seconds) = compound 1 first person 2 second person 3 third person ABIL abilitive aspect ANIM animate-numeral classifier CAUS causative CELER celeritive CLASS numeral classifier * COM completive aspect COP copula DESID desiderative aspect DET determiner DETRAN detransitive DIST distal DPM distal-patient marker DUR durative aspect EMP emphatic FEM feminine-noun classifier IN AM inanimate-numeral classifier INC incompletive aspect INCHOAT inchoative INTRAN intransitive IOpr indirect-object pronoun Ipr independent pronoun IRREAL irrealis LOC locative MASC masculine NEG negative OBLIG obHgative aspect OST ostensive PAS passive</page><page sequence="17">1 80 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology pi plural PL plural (third person) PN proper noun PPM proximal-patient marker Ppr possessive pronoun POS possessive POSIT positional PROX proximal REFL reflexive REL relative REPET repetitive REPORT reportative SPM subordinate-patient marker SUB subordination marker TOP topic TRAN transitive 3. The verb meaning 'go' is irregular, with the form o in in the completive aspect (as in [4]), b'el in the noncompletive aspects (as in [3]), and xi'ik in the subjunctive. 4. Similar constructions with fronted temporal adverbiais are standard in hiero- glyphic texts (Bricker 1986, 1988b). 5. Ordinarily, wa'ye' 'here' is a frozen form historically derived from the proxi- mal loctive wa'y and the topic marker -e'. The contrast of w'ay and wa'ye ' in (5) is unusual. 6. These narrative conventions are also reminiscent of structures found on stelae that record narrative events prior to the actual time of the erection of the monument, which often appears as a final date. A similar focus on the centrality of the home base is also reflected in Classic inscriptions by the use of emblem glyphs (Mathews 1991). The hieroglyphic almanacs in the Mayan codices also encode cycles whereby at the end of an almanac one returns to the beginning position (cf. Fought 1985; Höfling 1989a; Höfling and Ó'Neil 1992). 7. A similar alternation of aspectual marking to signal discourse units has also been noted for hieroglyphic texts (Bricker 1986; Hopkins and Josserand 1988). 8. In fact, it also operates at the level of sound in important ways, including pervasive sound symbolism (cf. Durbin 1973).
