The first two of these expeditions were conducted in Indo-China in 1936 by M. Philippe STERN, Associate Director of the Guimet Museum, and by Mme DE CORAL REfMUSAT, of the staff of the same museum. The third expedition was carried out by the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (D. A. F. A.) [Delegation archeologique frangaise en Afghanistan] in 1936 and 1937; it comprised Mme HACKIN, MM. Jean CARL and Jacques MEUNIE', and was under the leadership of M. Joseph HACKIN, Director of the Guimet Museum. While differing con- siderably both as regards their aims and the conditions attending their accomplishment, these three expeditions are of equal im- portance from the archaeological point of view. The expeditions to Indo-China had a fourfold purpose: to verify on the spot the stylistic hypotheses concerning Khmer art advanced by M. STERN during the past ten years; to take a num- ber of photographs of architectural and decorative details; to select a certain number of objects which the General Government of Indo-China was intending to send to the Guimet Museum; lastly, to participate in the excavations conducted by the Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient at Angkor. All these four aims were achieved; besides the decided interest which the occasion pre- sented for the Guimet Museum to enrich its Cam and Khmer collection, which already in 1935 was the finest in Europe, the fact of excavating the ground of Angkor was an enticing prospect. M. STERN left with a definite aim: to excavate the site of the Phnom Kuken, which had been identified on Mt. Mahendra, the a Translated from French under the direction of the editors. 213</page><page sequence="2">9214 JEANNINE AUBOYER capital of Jayavarman II (end of 8th-middle of 9th century).l To understand fully the significance of that aim, it is neces- sary to restate the problem briefly: the Mahendraparvata was that " Mountain of the Great Indra " upon which was established for the first time, if the stone inscription of Sdok Kak Thom is to be believed, the cult of Devarhja.2 It is well known that the first care of the Khmer rulers, as also that of the rulers of India, was to provide a justification of their royal mission; Jayavarman II appears to have needed it more than anyone else, for it seems that the end of the eighth century was a period of disturbances and of anarchy. The Khmer kingdom would even have fallen at that time under the suzerainty of the empire of Srlivijaya (Sumatra-Java). Whether a legitimate prince or a usurper, Jayavarman II "returned from Java" to restore the Khmer power; he quite naturally desired to free the Khmer kingdom from the foreign yoke, and that is why he instituted in 802 the worship of Devardja, which made him independent and a tribu- tary only of the divinity. To establish these important rituals, he selected a natural eminence bearing the name of the King of the Gods, Indra, whose celestial city is the ideal model of the city of a cakravartin king (universal ruler) ; upon it he accord- ingly erected a mountain-temple, and a Brahmin versed in the art of magic established, at his command, " for the enhancement of the world, the magic rites which bear the name of Devardja" (God-King). According to this ritual, a Linga (a phallic em- blem of Siva) was consecrated as the royal Linga and the per- sonality of the king bestowed upon it.3 To hold this at once divine and royal substitute, Jayavarman II had a shrine built on the Mahendraparvata, situated at a dis- tance of 40 kilometers, as the crow flies, northeast of Angkor Thom. It was a mountain-temple whose cosmological symbolism ' G. COEDES, Les capitales de Jayavarman II, Etudes cambodgiennes XX, BEFEO 98. 113 ff. 2L. FINOT, BEFEO 15, pt. 2. 8 G.

Jayavarman II may have borrowed it from Java, where he appears to have resided and where the Bdrdbudur represents a dynastic mountain-shrine in a very elaborate form. It appears that, even before the reign of Jayavarman II, there was already a connection between the cult of the Linga and the kingship; 5 in that case, the cult of Devardja must have bestowed upon that tradition an undeniably official character. It is quite natural that M. STERN should have wished to explore a spot so full of history and still rather neglected. That desire was strengthened by the fact that there was as yet an extremely limited number of plastic documents that could be placed around the date 802 A. D. An examination of the photographs which reproduced the remains of the Phnom Kulen known in 1935 had convinced M. STERN that they belonged in fact to a style inter- mediate between the style of the eighth century and that of the end of the ninth; the theory of the identity of the Mahendra- parvata with the present site of the Phnom Kulen was to be con- firmed by excavations. The search initiated by M. STERN, and in which he took part, confirmed the importance of the Phnom Kulen for the evolution of Khmer art: it was possible to establish that the art of the seventh century and of the beginning of the eighth was logically related to that of the ninth, and thus we have hence- 'Cf. in this connection: J.

AuBOYER, L'Indochine (in Encyclopedie Quillet, Histoire des Religions).</page><page sequence="4">216 JEANNINE AUBOYER forth filled a gap which made the beginning of the artistic pro- duction of the site of Angkor incomprehensible.6 Jayavarman II had caused five statues of Visnu to be erected upon the Mahendraparvata, no doubt because Visnu is the perfect symbol of the cakravartin whom every king was to aspire to resemble, indeed to identify himself with him. Among the items excavated at the Kulen by Ph. STERN and brought by him to the Guimet Museum, two statues of Visnu represent this hence- forth clearly definable style: they combine the hieratic spirit with highly skilful technique. The male garb consists of a smooth loin cloth like that of the seventh century, but already it has, like that of the tenth century, a cascade of folds in front in the shape of a double anchor. The female dress, now represented at the Guimet Museum by a large statue, bears the same signs of transition: smooth skirt of the seventh century, pleated flap fall- ing over the side, and several long vertical folds in front, which were to cover the entire skirt in the tenth century. The head and face likewise bear the characteristic traits of the seventh century and foreshadow those of the tenth. From the standpoint of decoration, it is incontestable that the reign of Jayavarman II brought a genuine renewal; foreign influences, coming chiefly from Java, are noticeable in the lintels of which a splendid ex- ample is now preserved at the Guimet Museum. Lastly, the little columns also bear out the fact that the square form, represented at the Guimet Museum, is characteristic of the style of the Kulen. This collection of sculptures was grouped with others originating from various Khmer sites and from Campa and were the fruit of the expeditions of M. STERN and Mme DE CORAL RE1MUSAT; special mention should be made of a fronton of Banteai Srei (a little temple dating from 967 A.D.), which has been studied by M. COEDJES.7 The program of the D. A. F. A. was very full and arranged so as to permit taking the utmost advantage of the seasons: from September to December 1936, preliminary explorations were car- ' Cf.

GIRSHMAN, temporarily asso- ciated with the D. A. F. A., explored the deep layers of the ground and reached a depth of fifteen meters, the level corresponding approximately to the year 1000 B. C. Moreover, the other mem- bers of the expedition explored into the very center of the sand desert which today covers a region that was once inhabited; from that region the D. A. F. A. brought back pictures of the Moslem citadel of Sar-o-tar built upon foundations dating from the third century of our era. The excavations at Begram, a city 80 kilometers north of Kabful and identified with ancient Kapis1, were particularly fruitful. This city flourished from the first to the fourth century of our era, under the domination of Kusana rulers. It was known by Hsijan- tsang, the Chinese pilgrim, who gives a clear description of it; the site was mentioned in 1833 by Charles MASSON, who pro- vided some excellent documents of his explorations.10 The ex- cavations conducted in 1936 in the bazaar quarter yielded only material of types already known; the enclosure opened in 1937, on the contrary, in room No. 10, which was walled in, disclosed an exceptional treasure: bronzes of purely Greek style, glassware of Syrian make, and ivories with Indian decorations. The re- moval of these pieces, a very delicate task, was entrusted to Mme HACKIN. Among the bronzes discovered there, may be mentioned a steelyard in the shape of Minerva (?) ; in the head, which is hollow, the refuse grain was poured. This piece, now at the Guimet Museum, is Greek in style and probably dates from the 2-3rd centuries of our era.1" Another remarkable item, allotted to the museum of Kabfil, is a dress shield protected by an outer 8 Cf.

The technique of this shield is particularly interesting, because the tails and fins of the dolphins are movable and form counterweights with little plummets concealed on the reverse side of the shield. When the shield was moved, it must have glittered in the sun and produced at the same time a sound calculated to beat the rhythms of the war dances. The pictorial theme represented on this shield was frequent at the end of the Hellenistic period and during the Roman era. The glassware represents a great variety of techniques: it is blown, cut, colored and even embossed. The invention of blown glass is of Syrian origin and is placed around the end of the first century B. C. From Tyr, Sidon and Alexandria the first pieces of glassware were diffused towards western Europe on the one hand, and towards Asia on the other. Taking certain glass ob- jects discovered in Gaul and in the Rheinland as a basis of com- parison, M. HACKIN was able to date those of Begram between the first and fourth centuries of the Christian era.12 The most interesting among them are certain ichthyomorphic phials whose origin is almost surely Syrian"3 and of which numerous replicas have been found at Cologne.14 But the rarest are the painted glasses, inasmuch as dwelling in the ground usually affects enamel colors; several of them were donated to the Guimet Museum. Their decoration, which has preserved all its freshness, is distinctly Hellenistic: most frequently it represents a combat between a Thracian and a Samnite gladiator."5 It is the ivory and bone plaques, however, that without doubt constitute the rarest find made at Begram: grouped together on the south side of the same room (No. 10) as the bronzes and glassware, these ivories adorned jewel caskets of soft wood. Be- tween the frame of the caskets and the plaques which adorned them "2Cf.

From the study of these ivories M. HACKIN has drawn several conclusions concerning the technique and the decorative motifs. As regards the motifs, it is observed that they all center around productions of Sdfic! (stfipa 1), Mathurd, and Amaravati; certain themes, of Mesopotamian origin, were ob- viously retouched by India, and it must be remembered that an inscription on the southern gate of Sdnfci pays tribute to the guild of ivory workers of Vidisa (Bhilsa, in the modern state of Gwalior).16 While the existence of this corporation in India is known to us by this inscription, no ivory of an early period has yet been found in Indian territory; those of Begram date from the first to the fourth centuries of the Christian era, and the con- nection with the ivory workers of Sdfic! is made certain by the similarity that can be observed between the writing of the in- scription of Snfic! and that of several characters carved on the reverse of the Begram plates. As for the iconographic themes represented on these plaques, they are very diverse; the most re- markable is perhaps that of the anguiped, of classical origin, con- taminated by the theme of Gilgamesh with the wild beasts, or of Enkidu protecting the cattle, of Mesopotamian origin and more specifically Sumerian. One may profitably compare, as M. HACKIN did, the Begram theme with that of the Pergamum frieze,"7 with that of Romanesque art 18 and with that of Mathurd."9 Monsters abound in the Begram ivories: yaksas, leogryphs, " grylles," etc.; the animals are treated with a sureness of touch and realism very close to the animal art of India. There are also many birds, and comparisons could be made between them and the art of Safncl, Mathurd and Amardvat! as regards the ducks and geese flying among bands of flowering foliage. The human figures approach very closely the Indian aesthetic concepts: women in half-relief, 52 centimeters high, are clearly related to the river goddesses 16 Ramaprasad CHANDA, Memoirs of the Arch.

Presumably contempor- aneous with the styles of Amardvat! and Mathurd, this art antici- pates the refinement of Ajantd and must be placed around the end of the second century or the beginning of the third. These women wear two types of costume: the wide girdle of pearls and the transparent skirt of ancient India, or the cut-out tunic, fitted at the waist, which partially covers a narrow pantaloon. Besides their exceptional value from the archaeological stand- point, the ivories of Begram enable us to see the existence in that region of an already elaborate secular art and of Indian traditions, while they borrowed Hellenistic elements at the time when the last Suhga kings were still maintaining relations with the Greek kings of Bactria. The Guimet Museum received a great number of these plaques, while the others were rightly allotted to the museum of Kabul. On the site of Fundukistan (" Valley of the Nut-trees "), M. CARL was commissioned to excavate a Buddhist monastery. This site is half-way between Kabuil and Bamiydn; it was mentioned in 1836 by Charles Masson. In 1936 a piece was accidentally discovered there and this determined the search which the D. A. F. A. decided to undertake in 1937. M. CARL cleared away the cells of the monastery and brought to light mural paintings and sculptures in high relief done in clay and bearing traces of poly- chromy. The murals bear a clear imprint of Indian art of the seventh and eighth centuries and, by their details and colors, approach the best Tibetan standards. Among the statues in half relief, some of which were brought to the Guimet Museum, one 20 Cf. especially the cave known as the Cave of Candragupta at Udayagiri (end of fourth-beginning of fifth centuries); cf. alsq VOGEL, Ganga et Yamund dans l'iconographie brahmanique, Etudes asiatiques 2, pl. 6a.</page><page sequence="9">FRENCH EXCAVATIONS IN INDO-CHINA AND AFGHANISTAN 221 of the most interesting represents an adorned Buddha wearing over his monastic robe a richly ornamented three-cornered hood.21 Another group, found in a niche, represents a princely couple; the man is dressed in Iranian, the lady in Indian style. From another niche comes a group which now is at the Guimet Museum: two Ndgardjas entirely anthropomorphic, their ophiomorphous nature being indicated only by a little snake on the heads of the figures. The latter must have been part of a representation of the Great Miracle of Srdvasti.22 All these paintings and sculptures show a clear Buddhist in- fluence from the North of India and influences of late Sassanian Iran (sixth-seventh centuries) ; these influences are in juxta- position without merging, giving a hybrid charm to the artistic conception of that period in Afghanistan. In the Buddhist monasteries of Shotorak, carefully described by Hsiian-tsang, M. MEUNIE' exhumed bas-reliefs in schist of Graeco-Buddhist style (third-fourth centuries). They present a great interest from the iconographic standpoint, and they prove that the schist was worked on the spot instead of having been imported completely sculpted from Gandhdra, as was believed heretofore: in fact, M. MEUNIE discovered a sketch and two or three unfinished bas-reliefs. Among other new themes brought by these sculptures may be mentioned the conversion of the three Kdsyapa brothers and of their disciples. From the point of view of style, M. HACKIN makes interesting comparisons between the reliefs of Shotorak and certain Wei steles (sixth century of the Christian era).23 The discovery of purely Graeco-Buddhist pieces at Shotorak supports M. HACKIN'S theory concerning the objects discovered by him in December 1936 at Kunduz; 24 according to him, the 21 This characteristic dress is found also at Bdmiydn (cave i) and at Kizil. 22A.

In fact, up to the present, archaeologists had met with complete failure in Bactria; and yet, Bactria was a country that was Hel- lenized at an early period, before Alexander's invasion, this in- fluence having penetrated by way of the silk route. Coins have been found which attest those relations since the sixth or fifth century B. C. After Alexander's invasion, Bactria had remained Greek, whereas the satrapies of Asia and of Arachosia were occu- pied by the Mauryas. Moreover, Buddhism must have found, after around 250 B. C., a favorable ground in Bactria to develop according to the formulae which Indian superstitions still tended to reject. All this was to lead logically to the belief that Bactria had been an important center for the development and diffusion of Graeco-Buddhist art. But in the face of the absolutely negative results obtained by M. FOUCHER from his excavations of 1922 to 1926, archaeologists had acknowledged themselves defeated and had christened that disillusionment the " Bactrian mirage." How- ever, a fragment of a statue unexpectedly discovered at Kunduz in September 1936 compelled M. HACKIN to search the place in December 1936. The few heads that he was able to find there are stamped with an almost purely Greek influence, particularly noticeable in the specimens manifesting a freedom of expression unusual in Gandhira. For all these reasons M. HACKIN proposes to revise the theories advanced on this subject and to place the center of diffusion of the Graeco-Buddhist style in Afghanistan rather than in India.25 It will be seen how fruitful have been these two years of French excavation in Afghanistan and Indo-China; the Guimet Museum of Paris has rightly profited by them, inasmuch as the expeditions were carried out by its directors. It is thus enriched without impoverishing the countries of origin, and constitutes henceforth a more and more complete repository of Asiatic arts. 2"For the study of Graeco-Buddhist style, the important work remains of course that of M. FOUCHER, L'art greco-bouddhique du Gandhdra, but it is certain that the problem is presented in a different light since the excavations in Afghanistan.</page></plain_text>
