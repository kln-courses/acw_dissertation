<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS A CHRONOLOGY FOR THE " LURISTAN BRONZES " By P. R. S. Moorey* The appearance of Dr. Peter Calmeyer's Datierbare Bronzen aus Luristan und Kirmanshah (Berlin, 1969) marks an important stage in the developing study of the pre-Achaemenian metalwork of western Iran. It has been clear to some students ever since the early I930s, soon after the first major wave of clandestine excavation, that the so-called " Liristan Bronzes " were a very heterogeneous collection of objects ranging over a period of at least two thousand years, derived originally from many sources, Mesopota- mian as well as Iranian, and made not by one, but by a number of bronze workshops varying widely in the time and place of their greatest productivity. Yet apart from a comprehensive but extremely concise essay by Schaeffer included in his Stratigraphie compare'e et chronologie de l'Asie Occidentale of 1948, no one has until now made a systematic attempt to unravel this material by comparative typological analysis. Two scholars, Deshayes and Potratz, have done vital work of this kind on the tools and the horse-bits respectively, but in neither case was the central Zagros region their primary concern.' Calmeyer has now isolated over seventy groups of bronze artefacts which he believes may be dated on the basis either of the cuneiform inscriptions some of them bear or close parallels from controlled excavations, generally outside Iran. All future students will be indebted to him for the care with which he has assembled his lists, with full bibliography. The types are usually illustrated in line-drawings with a few selected items only on half-tone plates. It is the very excellence of his documentation and the apparent finality of the general conclusions he draws which have prompted me to a divergent view in the following pages, since Calmeyer's book is certain to be a standard work of reference for some time to come in this field of study. I have no fault to find with the method in principle, nor, with very rare exceptions, in application. My prime concern is to point out what I believe to be a false perspective which may follow from relying exclusively upon these closely dated groups in any future attempt to reconstruct the bronze industries of south-western Iran before the Achaemenian period, particularly when so many of the groups are so far only dated through foreign parallels and may often indeed include objects made outside Liristan. It must be remembered in reading this book that Calmeyer is primarily concerned with providing a corpus, not an interpretation. I It will be immediately apparent to any reader of Calmeyer's book in the least acquainted with " Liristdn Bronzes " that the most distinctive objects from this region, those with elaborate cast bronze decoration in an often extravagant zoomorphic style (notably cheekpieces for horse-bits, standard- finials, decorated tubes, pins, especially those with opencast heads, bracelets etc.) and their sheetmetal relatives, are virtually absent.2 The reason is obvious: since they are not strictly speaking " datable " they fall outside the author's chosen terms of reference. As yet they have no close parallels beyond the * I am most grateful to Dr. Peter Calmeyer for discussing his views with me and allowing me to muster his groups as on figures t and 2 (I alone am responsible for the arrangement); to Mr. Joost Crouwel for reading a draft of this paper; and to Mrs. Pat Clarke for the drawing. In figures I and 2 the object representing each group is only a general guide to its contents, which may on occasion be various. Both Dr. Clare Goff and Mr. W. Lerouge kindly read a draft of this paper and I have benefitted con- siderably from their comments; but for what remains I alone am to be held responsible. Note on terminology: As there is no agreed terminology for the stages of cultural development in Lfiristin I have used the Meso- potamian chronology with Calmeyer, until c. I2oo B.C. and then that proposed by Dyson and Cuyler Young for N.W. Iran (Early Iron I-III). In doing so I have used them conventionally with no implication of cultural relations. x J.

With a very few notable exceptions they have still to be found in controlled excavations within the region of origin. The author is thus perfectly justified in excluding them from his system of classification, but in doing so, and in then virtually ignoring them, he runs the grave risk that his general conclusions will be to this extent deficient. Of all the bronzes reported from the central Zagros region these are the very ones which may most reasonably be taken as products of local workshops. Their very isolation emphasizes this. With objects closely paralleled to the west in Mesopotamia or Syria or to the south in Elam, some indeed bearing Elamite or Babylonian inscriptions, it is always a viable possibility that the type, if not the actual object, is an import into the central Zagros area. As such they are very instructive in defining Lfiristan's commercial relations, and the range and direction of foreign military and political contact, in any particular period. But they are far less significant in elucidating the cultural history of Liristin itself. Calmeyer's general presentation of his evidence is clear and systematic. He begins with a critical review of previous conclusions on the chronology of the " Liristdn Bronzes ". This is always a hazardous undertaking as each authority has tended to define his terms of reference slightly differently. Though this is only a brief review, and the author makes no claim that it is comprehensive, more mention might have been made of the pioneer studies of Godard, Pope, Dussaud and Przeworski whose books and articles in the 1930s opened virtually all the lines of research subsequently pursued. The dated groups are next considered in detail. The majority, 1-53, are arranged consecutively in chronological order with full lists and select comment on points of style, provenance and chronology. All this is most welcome and useful; naturally, where Deshayes has been before, Calmeyer simply follows with further examples and modifications in detail. Generally speaking Calmeyer argues for a more precise chronology than Deshayes believed the evidence would normally support. Groups 54-68 are separated (pp. I 17 ff.) and arranged typologically, using the evidence assembled in the earlier part of the book to date them. In a way this is unfortunate as the reader must do a lot of flicking backwards and forwards in order to muster, for instance, all the information offered on maceheads and daggers. Though the objects in these groups may be more various and not so closely datable as those already considered, physical separation from the basic groups to which they are most nearly related hinders rather than advances the main argument. Two at least of the earlier groups-26: Gefdsse mit konkaver Wandung and 23: Addahuau-dxte-are almost as mixed.3 No such objection may be raised to the total isolation of forgeries and pastiches (pp. 137 ff.). The questions raised by pastiches are particularly difficult to resolve and in certain cases there may be more ground for confidence than the author allows.4 With his evidence mustered and ordered Calmeyer proceeds to his general analysis and conclusions, considering in turn matters of provenance, style, inscriptions, local production, and imports and exports. His first general conclusion is basic and vital. Through an examination of the places in western Iran commonly associated in the past with clandestine excavation of bronzes he demonstrates that even in its primary geographical sense the term Lfiristdn has little or no force in describing objects reported from an area extending well beyond the frontiers of this province. No-one would dispute this, but his analysis does not allow sufficiently for what accurate information there is and its relevance to the question of local industries. Both Dr. Goff5 and the Danish Lfiristdn Expedition,6 not to mention the pioneer records of Herzfeld and Godard,7 have demonstrated that through careful questioning of the local residents some facts may still be gleaned about the general distribution of specific types of bronze. Emphasis might also be made to a dangerous trend in the opposite direction.

Objects from workshops in northern Iran are gratuitously attributed to Liiristdn and vice versa. This uncertainty is well illustrated by Calmeyer's group 24: Tierprotomen- und Rimsin-Gerate. It is possible that objects of this form have been found both in Lairistin and the south-west Caspian region, but from their Mesopotamian analogies these are probably west, rather than north-west, Persian artefacts. The pioneer stages of copper and bronze metallurgy in Liiristan, before the middle of the third millennium B.C., are so far unknown. Neither clandestine nor controlled excavations have yet revealed metal objects which may confidently be attributed to this period. For the next thousand years, c. 2600- 16oo B.C. evidence may now be adduced from both sources. The appropriate sections of Deshayes's corpus of tools had already made clear that during this time there was little or no marked typological distinction between the products of workshops in Mesopotamia, Elam and Liristan. Calmeyer's first twenty-five groups emphasize this wide area of affinity through constant reference to excavated parallels outside Iran for the undecorated tools and weapons from Liiristan. The wide range of metalwork from gallery-graves at Bani Surmah and Kalleh Nisar excavated by the Belgium LiIristan Expedition now indicate unequivocally the close links then existing between the forms favoured by the metalsmiths of southern Iran and Elam, central Iraq and western LUristdn, even on occasion north Syria and Lairistan.8 Less satisfactory evidence from excavations further east in the mountain-zone separating Iraq and the central Persian plateau, primarily at Tepe Giyan and Tepe Djamshidi, at Kamtarlan and Chigha Sabz, suggest that they also shared a comparable range of plain metal types. It is only in the use of simple cast bronze zoomorphic and anthropomorphic decoration on tools and weapons that western Iran seems to stand alone. The extreme rarity at this time of such decoration in Iraq and Syria serves to emphasize its importance in Iran though surviving examples are not yet very numerous. In isolated cases, particularly the Early Dynastic chariot reinrings (Calmeyer's Group I), both Sumer and western Iran appear to share a common decorated form. Much more often the decorated forms may only be traced back to Susa, not into Iraq. Calmeyer dates the development of a distinctive West Iranian bronze style, characterized by this decoration, to the period between the death of Shulgi and the end of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The chronology is well founded, but the question of its cultural affinity remains. It is most likely to be " Old Elamite ". Though some examples, for instance the axes in Calmeyer's group 20, might even be " Old Babylonian " or " Old Assyrian ". Only in an extremely general sense, by using such animals as the lion and goat, does it anticipate the later (Early Iron I-IIIA) cast bronze decoration of" L ristin bronzes ". In no case so far published is there any close stylistic affinity between the decoration of these axes, adzes, pick-axes etc., and the later finials, pinheads and horse-bits. From every point of view it is most unfortunate that for the period from c. 1600oo-12oo00 B.C. (Cal- meyer's BergvOlkerzeit) controlled archaeological excavations both in Iraq and in Iran have so far re- vealed comparatively little metalwork. For this period Calmeyer has two groups of maceheads and daggers (Groups 27, 31), with very wide geographical and chronological distributions, a spearpoint, bearing an inscription of Humbanumena (Group 29) which Dr. Reiner has condemned as spurious,9 and the simple naturalistic caprid standard-finials (Group 30). The dating of this last group is crucial, for if it really belongs even as early as the thirteenth century B.C. then there is at least some evidence for an individual local Larist1n bronze style in the second half of the second millennium B.C. (i.e. Late Bronze Age) as such objects are so far unknown from Iraq or further west. This early dating is based exclusively on iconographic parallels between these standard-finials and similar pairs of rampant caprids cut on Mitannian, Kassite and Middle Elamite cylinder seals; a method of dating these bronzes first used extensively by Herzfeldmo and more recently applied by Miss Porada, whom Calmeyer cites to support his dating. But Miss Porada does not argue for such a high date and is, even so, very cautious in her application of the glyptic evidence: " It is conceivable, there- fore, that the earliest goat standards should be associated in time with the rings (i.e. finger rings in a S L.

'), although the similarity in posture between the goats of the standards and those of the cylinder from Surkh Dum may also point to a later date ".11 Van Loon subsequently pointed out that evidence from the Dum Surkh shrine necessitated revisions in Miss Porada's scheme which would involve among other things a lower chronology.12 Recent finds by the Belgium Liiristan Expedition and Dr. Goff, which will be cited later in this paper, do not favour a Late Bronze Age date for the standard-finials. It is opportune here in view of Calmeyer's high chronology to look again at an historical hypothesis recurrent in work on the " LfiristTn Bronzes ". Though Calmeyer himself avoids ethnic or political affiliations for the makers of the bronzes he lists, his chronology may well be taken to strengthen the arguments of those who would attribute the most exotic to the Kassites. Godard was long the main exponent of the view that the most highly decorated bronzes were to be associated with the Kassites after their withdrawal or expulsion from Babylonia into the Zagros mountains in the later twelfth century B.C. Ghirshman has already raised some cogent objections.13 There is nothing in common between the bronzework of Babylonia as we know it and that distinctive of Lfiristan in the crucial period. Objects they shared, like the flange-hilted dangers, were so widely used at the time in south-west Asia as not to be diagnostic. Although a people known to the Assyrians and later Greek geographers as " Kassites " were probably to be found at least on the periphery of western Lfiristdn, it may not be assumed that their material culture had anything in common with that of the Kassites of Iraq in an earlier period. There is virtually no evidence for the systematic expulsion of the Kassites from Iraq after the collapse of their political supremacy there c. I1I8o B.C. Indeed there is a distinct possibility that the Second Sea-land and Bazi Dynasties may mark a renaissance of Kassite political influence in Babylonia after the native Babylonian Second Isin Dynasty.14 Close links persisted between the centres of political authority in the plain and the eastern mountain regions, presumably much as before the twelfth century B.C. As far as it is possible to judge the eastern Kassites at this time and well into the Neo-Assyrian period dwelt in the foothills and lower ranges of the Zagros mountains between the Little Zab and the Diyala, if not also further to the south.15 As the excavations of the Belgium Lfiristdn expedition have shown, this region used metalwork with strong Mesopotamian affinities, very rarely exhibiting the distinctive characteristics of contemporary metalwork further to the east in the heart of L-iristan. The plain ware, pedestal-goblets typical of the second level of occupation at Tepe Guran, which have been compared to " Kassite " pottery from Nippur and Ur,16 are exactly like Middle Elamite pottery from Susa, c. I150-1000oo B.C.1' They are as likely to reflect some kind of Elamite penetration into the Hulai- lan plain as they are Kassite influences. Among the " Lfiristdn bronzes " the last two centuries of the second millennium B.C. are marked by an ever-increasing number of weapons and vessels, at first generally flange-hilted daggers, later arrow- heads and situlae, inscribed for Babylonian and Elamite rulers and their officials. Calmeyer offers an excellent list of these objects with detailed refutation of Ghirshman's " Cimmerian hypothesis ", now generally agreed to be untenable.'s Calmeyer argues cogently that the inscribed bronzes must be taken individually as the reflection of contemporary political or military interest in the region by the rulers whose names they bear. Though, as they were all robbed out, the ways they reached the Zagros will always remain mysterious, no single comprehensive historical explanation is satisfactory. It perhaps needs to be made clear that no inscribed bronze which may confidently be attributed to a local L&amp;ristin workshop has yet been published, save for the Pusht-i-Kuh statuette, whose inscription is neither 1x E.

Inscriptions indicate that to the period from c. I200-Iooo B.C. belong the earlier flange-hilted bronze daggers (Group 31), and the spike-butted and crescentic axes (Groups 33-34) so commonly reported from Liristan. Both the daggers and the spike-butted axes are occasionally reported with traced designs, but it is only the bronze shaft-holes of axes and adzes which bear the richly modelled plastic decoration. They encourage the suggestion that it was through such imported objects as these that various foreign styles, " Middle Babylonian " perhaps as much as " Middle Elamite ", stimulated fresh developments in Lfristdn workshops in Early Iron I. On the crescentic axes especially it is pos- sible to trace the stylistic changes through which the lion and lion mask so often chosen to decorate them passed from a fine naturalistic form-perhaps the Elamite prototype-to the stylized geometric patterning and " coil-style " modelling so characteristic of the Lairistin smiths.20 It is here that the limitations of Calmeyer's exclusively comparative method become most apparent as he passes from Einheimische Stile ca. I2oo-9oo B.C. to Einheimische Stile der assyrischen Weltreichszeit entirely on the basis of his few dated groups, completely ignoring an enormous range of other metalwork whose stylistic homogeneity, if nothing else, indicates that it should at least receive passing mention here. Even the three groups 31, 33 and 34 may contain objects more recent than 9oo B.C. Weapons of these types both entirely of bronze, and those combining bronze and iron, were in production well into the first millennium B.C. A bronze spike-butted axe-head with lion mask was found in the eighth century level at Dum Surkh21 and spike-butted axes are shown in use on ninth century Neo-Assyrian carved ivories from Nimrud.22 Calmeyer associates a group of iron bracelets decorated with a stylized lion- mask (which has bronze prototypes) with the crescentic axes (Groups 34 and 69). The comparison is cogent; but the chronological implications are even more telling since such a bracelet is worn by Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak, ruler of Elam, c. 653-648 B.C., on a fragmentary stela from Susa. What the metal was is naturally unknown, but this does not affect the basic chronological point.23 For the first quarter of the first millennium B.C. Calmeyer has mustered a varied series of artefacts many of them, if not actually made outside western Iran, then made there under strong Assyrian or Urartian influence (especially Groups 42, 44, 46, 50). They offer interesting corroborative evidence for increasing military and commercial contacts between Ltiristin and the north-west after the ninth century B.C. The dilemma to which Calmeyer's scrupulous application of his comparative method leads is high- lighted by a paragraph where he takes issue with Ghirshman (p. I59). Ghirshman has said that the art of Lfiristan showed no coherent stylistic development based on recognizable creative phases.24 Calmeyer in contrast claims to have isolated a number of such stages. But there is a distinct sense in which the two scholars are not speaking of the same thing. The style to which Ghirshman refers is that of the very objects which scarcely feature in Calmeyer's groups and do not emerge at all in his concluding survey. The genesis of this style, though perhaps not so obscure as Ghirshman's generalization would suggest, is indeed still very difficult to discern from the available evidence. It does for the moment appear, almost certainly misleadingly, as a sudden phenomenon without obvious antecedents. What Calmeyer has traced so well is something rather different. He has shown conclusively that the nature and distinctive characteristics of West Iranian bronzework, as distinct from that of Iraq and Syria, has nothing to do with an " Animal Style " in the sense understood for the Scythians and related cultures, nor is the oft- cited zoomorphic juncture a sudden, or even a very important diagnostic, trait in this style.25 In every respect it is possible to trace back to at least 200ooo B.C., through bronze artefacts reported from western Iran, the slow and steady development of a style of cast bronze zoomorphic decoration, including the 19 E.

But Calmeyer stops at the very point when this style emancipates itself from its origins and takes on a complexion entirely its own within a unique range of artefacts. Before about Ioo000 B.C. it is by no means distinctive of Loiristdn alone; after this time there is a sense in which it may be. It is in the two sections on local bronzes (pp. 175-6) and imports and exports (pp. 177-84) that the nature of the stages Calmeyer has traced become most apparent. He makes clear himself how few of the artefacts reported from the central and south western Zagros region before c. 00ooo B.C. may confidently be attributed to local workshops. Even objects so far reported only from this region, like the spike-butted and crescentic axes and the decorated situlae, might arguably be described either as " Middle Babylo- nian " or " Middle Elamite " on the basis of iconography, style and inscriptions. With them, to varying degrees, go all Calmeyer's groups from the earliest to the latest, though as time went on Assyria and Urartu replace Babylonia and Elam as the main sources. The position is well illustrated by a small anomaly in the book's arrangement at this point. Although a still unexplained group of cast bronze fittings of Babylonian or Elamite origin are isolated (Group 70o) as imports, the Louvre and Toronto Old Babylonian standards, of very similar origin and arguably of comparable date, inconsistently find a place much earlier in the main sequence of groups (no. 25). It is to be regretted that Calmeyer does not set his conclusions about Lfiristan and its bronzework into their wider Iranian context, examining particularly in the light of his proposed chronological scheme the whole question of relations with the north on the one hand, Elam and the south on the other. Indeed throughout the book relatively little attention is paid to historical problems, more precisely the various political situations underyling each historical phase distinguished in the stylistic analysis (pp. 151-6o). Documentary evidence is admittedly meagre, but it can give some life to the chronological skeleton Calmeyer has so admirably constructed. This is not such a serious weakness as the virtual absence of reference to local Iron Age bronzework from Ltiristmn. This will be the central concern of the rest of the paper. I shall attempt to show in very concise form that if Calmeyer's terms of reference are extended, admittedly into less well-explored territory, a rather different picture emerges in which it may be reasonable, accepting all the abuses to which the term has been subjected, to speak of distinctive local bronze styles, at least during Early Iron II-IIIA, c, Iooo/950-650/600 B.C., in Lfiristdn and southern Kurdistan. II At the beginning of this article it was noted that certain groups of objects long associated with Liiris- tan are conspicuous by their absence from Calmeyer's book. Though many of these objects are still without an exact chronology, they are not so ill-dated as their absence from his book might be taken to indicate. Indeed it is the more closely dated objects among them which offer vital clues to the range and character of the metalwork used in Lfiristan in the first four centuries of the first millennium B.C. They may be concisely reviewed by category, with special emphasis on present evidence for their date. Bronze harness-trappings have long been taken as particularly characteristic of Lfiristdn and more than one scholar has used them to reconstruct the nomadic origin of their creators.26 Potratz classified the horse-bits into five main groups which admirably cover the range of objects, though further sub- division, especially in his group V, will eventually be required to embrace an ever-increasing variety of types. Group I (partially covered by Calmeyer's Group 38): cheekpieces in the form of rectangular or sub-rectangular openwork plaques, almost invariably mounted on rigid mouthpieces; many with zoomorphic decoration: Outside Iran this type of horse-bit, which developed from a narrower Late Bronze Age form, is shown in the ninth century on the glazed brick friezes of Tukulti-Ninuta II at Assur27 and on the reliefs 26 I have argued against these assumptions in Iran VII (1969), pp. 137-8, 148. 27 Perhaps also the earlier " White Obelisk "--Unger, Mitteilungen der Altorientalischen Gesellschaft VI (1932), pp. 3 ff., pl.

Bronze cheek-piece for a horse-bit of Group I: Ashmolean Museum, 1951. 192a. of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud.28 By the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 B.C.) such cheekpieces appear to have passed out of use in Assyria, where there is so far no evidence for the zoomorphic decora- tion used on them in Lairistan.29 A plain bit of this form was reported from the mountain shrine at Tang-i-Hamamlan in Liristdn,30 contemporary with those in Assyria. Two decorated cheekpieces of this type from Iran may indicate that they were still current there until at least the later eighth century B.C. when they had passed out of fashion in the west. The horse-head protomes on a pair of cheekpieces in the Azizbeglou collection31 wear paddle-shaped blinkers commonly shown on Neo-Assyrian reliefs and found, of ivory and bronze, in contexts of the later eighth and seventh centuries from western Iran to the Aegean. In many ways more significant is another cheekpiece decorated with a horse protome whose distinctive silhouette and modelling bears a much closer relation to the sloping planes and sharp arises of Scythian art than to the styles of western Asia.32 Such influences are unlikely to have penetrated to the central Zagros before the eighth century B.C. The terminal of a bone or horn cheekpiece carved in a typically " Scythian " style was found in level IV at Hasanlu.33 In Liristan bits of this group may be dated from c. 900/850-750/700 B.C.

The function of a wide variety of spoked and unspoked wheel-shaped objects reported from Lairistdn has given rise to debate. Although round cheekpieces appear on the earliest metal horse-bits yet found in south-west Asia, they are not shown on Neo-Assyrian reliefs and may have passed out of use in Iraq and the Levant after the Late Bronze Age. At least two complete horsebits with round cheekpieces, reported as from LUristan, may date to the Late Bronze rather than Early Iron Age.34 In one case the ends of the mouthpiece are not reversed as is invariably the case with Early Iron Age horsebits from Liristan in groups I, III-V.

The rare examples with two loops and a strong central hole with a collar to take a mouthpiece might well have been mounted in the normal manner as cheekpieces.35 The " wheels " without loops are ambiguous. Some have central re-inforced holes with collars and are quite strong enough to have been mounted on a mouthpiece as a bit with the cheekstraps knotted round the ferrule as required. Others are too weak and have no collared central hole.36 They are to be classified with the largest group of all, those with a single loop and often elaborate zoomorphic decora- tion, whose central aperture is virtually never suitable for mounting on a mouthpiece as a horse-bit. Sometimes it is much too wide, at others when the wheel is spoked too small and weak; and in a number of cases the circular frame is completely filled by a semi-human figure.37 It is also surprising that, if the numerous " wheel-fittings " from Liristan really were cheekpieces, almost none have survived mounted on mouthpieces, whereas all other forms of cheekpiece from Lfiristan are as often reported in complete as in detached examples. These objects are best regarded as ornamental " horse-brasses". Since the cast decoration is exactly that found on the range of pinheads from Ltiristan dated from the ninth to seventh centuries B.C. (see p. 126) at Dum Surkh, they may be taken as an aspect of the local industry at this time. Group III: bar cheekpieces, cast separately from the canons which pass through a hole in the centre of the cheekpiece; on flexible mouthpieces. Fig. 5. Bronze horse-bit of Group III after J. A. H.

Fig. 6. Bronze horse-bit of group IV after J. A. H. Potratz, Die Pferdetrensen des Alten Orient, fig. 6o. Cheekpieces of this form do not appear on Neo-Assyrian reliefs and no examples have yet been reported from controlled excavations in western Asia; but two very similar cheekpieces were found by the French excavators at Delphi in Greece.42 Though they are not exactly like examples from Lfiristdn, their relative isolation in the Greek range of horse-harness suggests that they follow closely an eastern pattern. Their archaeological context is obscure, but most unlikely to date before the earlier seventh century B.C. As the animal-heads used to decorate these cheekpieces in Liiristin in no way depart either in style or form from the repertory so familiar in this area they fall, like the bits already con- sidered, in the later ninth to eighth centuries B.C. The mountain goat and mouflon appear, but not so commonly as the horse, and a bird's head found also on the standard-finials and almost certainly in- tended for a cock, crude as casting sometimes is. Group V: (partially covered by Calmeyer's Group 52) opencast cheekpieces in the form of animals, real and imaginary, or groups combining sub-human figures and monsters; with very rare exceptions43 set on rigid mouthpieces. Fig. 7. Bronze horse-bit of Group V after J. A. H. Potratz, Die Pferdetrensen des Alten Orient, fig. 64d. It is the horse-bits of this group which above all epitomize the iconographic range of the Lfiristin smiths and have generally been held to be particularly characteristic of their work. Zoomorphic cheek- pieces, always horses, appear on Neo-Assyrian reliefs only in the reign of Sennacherib (704-681 B.C.) and even then are confined to the chariot-horses of the King or the model horse's head set at the end of the yoke-pole of his ceremonial wheeled chair.44 Such a cheekpiece, of electrum, was found at Nimrud among debris dumped about 614 B.C.45 Fragments of what are almost certainly similar Assyrian, not Lilristmn, bronze cheekpieces cast as horses have been found at Lindos and Samos46 in seventh century contexts. Like the Nimrud cheekpiece and those shown on Neo-Assyrian reliefs the horse does not stand on a ground line as is invariably the case in Ltiristln. The isolation of this zoomorphic form in the 42 P.

How much earlier than Sennacherib's reign the bits were used in Lfiristan is still totally obscure, though certain iconographic and stylistic traits indicate that it is unlikely to go back more than a century or two. Miss Porada has drawn attention to the iconographic parallels between the most elaborately deco- rated of these cheekpieces, particularly those cast as mythological monsters or demons and beasts in conflict, and scenes on glazed bricks found at Susa.47 The importance of this link has been increased by Amiet's subsequent attribution of many of these bricks to a small temple at Susa built there by Shutruk- Nahunte II about 7oo B.C.4s Previously these fragments had been variously attributed to the Middle or Neo-Elamite periods. Similar mythological monsters were used in the decoration of a group of faience vessels found both at Susa and in the seventh century level of the shrine at Dum Surkh.49 It is a small link in the chain of evidence which leads to a generation or two c. 750/725 B.C.-675/65o B.C. as the crucial phase in the creation of the most exotically decorated horse-bits and " wands " (see p. 126). In the following half century these bits were superseded. Slowly accumulating evidence indicates that by the later seventh century B.C. and through to the end of the Achaemenian period the most common type of bronze horse-bit in western Asia was made with bar cheekpieces cast in one with the corresponding canon. The canons interlock, or are joined by a large ring, and are often covered with tiny spikes.50 The prototype appears in Assyria and Urartu by the eighth century B.C. and may be the type of horse-bit worn by Assurbanipal's hunters; very slightly later examples were found at Khorsabad.51 In Iran they are reported from excavations at Kaluraz and Persepolis.52 Even to a society where metal was so readily available as that of Liiristan, metal horse-bits were probably used only as military or ceremonial equipment. It may be tentatively suggested on the basis of the chronological evidence assembled here that the types of horse-bit used in Lairistan until the end of the second millennium B.C. differed not at all from those used in the west. Groups I, III and IV may be taken to represent the horse-bits most commonly used in Liristan from the ninth to seventh centuries B.C. The horse-bits of Group V are in many ways a special case. The form, like that of Group I, is archaic. It is still basically the Late Bronze Age form with long rigid mouthpiece and flat studded cheekpieces. Mrs. Littauer has explained the role of both in the directional control of driven horses.53 There is good reason for thinking that such bits were used in Lflristdn for driving, not for riding, horses. Indeed one very small group of these bits has cheekpieces cast as chariots.54 Many scholars, notably Ghirshman,55 have argued that absence of wear and the elaborate cheekpieces indicate votive, or, at most, exclusively ceremonial horse-trappings. Careful examination of the collars round the central holes in many of these cheekpieces, through which the mouthpiece passes, reveals more evidence for use, some of it very hard, than is commonly acknowledged. Certain of these collars show wear at between six and eight, rather than between six and four, o'clock as would be expected from the method of harnessing these cheekpieces clearly shown on Assyrian reliefs.66 Now a horse may more easily fight a bit with rigid mouthpiece, by getting his tongue over it, than it could a snaffle. This may only be counteracted by fastening the bit very high in its mouth. It is likely that the bits of Group V which show this distinctive wear would have been worn by horses who had this bad habit.

Since the collar is occasionally worn right through this seems a more likely explana- tion than the viable alternative that such bits were worn by horses harnessed up to a vehicle and led from the front. A horse resisting or rearing up in this position would wear the collar like this; but it would take very considerable use to wear it through. Standard-finials: This large group of highly distinctive objects, so far without parallel outside Lfiristan, is central to any assessment of its bronze industry. The weaknesses of an exclusively iconographical approach to their dating have already been briefly examined above, (pp. I 15-6). Though still scanty in the extreme, archaeological evidence provides at least two fixed points. Only two finials, both elaborate " masters- of-animals " and a fragment of an anthropomorphic tube have yet been reported from excavations and in one case the circumstances of discovery leave much to be desired. No objects of this type were found in the shrine at Dum Surkh during controlled excavations, but " Gilgamesh " finials are said to have been found there in subsequent clandestine excavations.57 A bottle-shaped support for a standard-finial is reported among the material found in what was probably a contemporary mountain shrine at Tang-i-Hamamlan.58 At Bdba Jan in eastern L-iristin part of a spirally decorated bronze tube termi- nating in a grotesque " Janus-head " was found in a deposit dating to the latest phase of Bdbd Jan II, Fig. 8.

In grave 4 at Tepe Tattulban (Chinan) in western Liiristan, excavated byVanden Berghe, a " master-of-animals " finial with faces on the central tube was associated with pottery indi- cating a date in the second half of the eighth century B.C. or slightly later.60 A less elaborate finial of exactly this form was reported by Madame Maleki from a grave in Hulailan in association with a flange-hilted bronze dirk and two baked clay tripod jars.6' It remains an open question whether or not the grave was salted by the clandestine excavators to satisfy their visitors; the results of subsequent controlled excavations at Godin Tepe, Tepe Guran and Tepe Biba Jan do not inspire confidence in the association. Dr. Goff observed as a result of her careful surveys and questioning of local Lurs that standards were usually reported and produced from sites with a thick Iron Age occupation, including several where there was little or no Bronze Age deposit.62 57 J.

It might be expected then that the most natural rampant wild goat finials would appear during the course of Early Iron I-II (c. I Ioo-9oo B.C.), but certainly not much earlier. Pins: An enormous variety of straight pins with richly decorated heads and upper shanks have been reported from Laristan. For the purpose of rapid chronological review they may be broadly grouped into three main classes: A: those with simple cast heads, either geometric (discs, domes, cones etc.), or shapes of floral or zoomorphic inspiration. Unlike the two following classes B and C, these pins are neither distinctive of Liristan alone nor, with rare exceptions, as yet very closely dated. In common with the rest of western Asia, Lfiristan used relatively plain pins with geometrically shaped heads and moulded upper shanks from the third until well into the first millennium B.C. Only an already-growing corpus of excavated examples both inside Liaristin and from sites to the west will allow the construction of a well-dated typological series. Certain points are already clear. Western Iran, Lfiristin in particular, is remarkable for the range and elabora- tion of design found there on bronze pins, particularly in the Early Iron Age. Only Caucasia, it seems, supported a comparable range. Though the geometric forms may often be paralleled in the west, those of floral or zoomorphic inspiration are more commonly confined to western Iran. In the Dum Surkh shrine64 the tenth century level yielded pins with pomegranate or globular heads with horizontal disks, though by the seventh century very simple geometric shapes outnumber floral ones. But this is a fashion, as also is the taste for pinheads in the form of ducks and ibexes, which runs the length and breadth of the Zagros. It is only when the peculiar stylistic traits of the LDristan smiths transform these creatures, or create pinheads in the form of linear lion masks, highly stylized lions or winged monsters that a local industry and local fashions become more evident. A single pin of this type was found at Baba Jan in a ninth to eighth century context.65 Fig. 9. Bronze pin from Tepe Bbad Jdn after C. Goff, Iran VI (1968), p. 129, fig. 12. B: large openwork cast bronze heads, often on an iron shank, usually with figures and animals set in crescentic or square frames; described as " wands " by Schmidt. The full publication of the Dum Surkh shrine will throw considerable light on the date of these objects which occurred there in quantity, varying from " simple forms to finely modeled winged animals and intricate 'Gilamesh' patterns, showing a person in combat with two animals ".66 The simpler forms appear at Dum Surkh in the ninth century, but the most elaborate designs seem to be commonest there in the eighth century at a time when Elamite imagery, as has already been noted with regard to horse-bits of Group V, was again exerting considerable influence, at least in southern Liiristln. Pins of this class have not yet been reported outside LUiristan. 63 Dark Ages, p. 2 1. 64 M. van Loon, Bib. Or.

They appear first at Dum Surkh in the ninth century, but only develop elaborate decoration in the following century or so.67 There are two major groups. In the first the pinhead is treated as an open field and a simple, often crudely executed design is not necessarily dependeit on a central fixed point. The designs are geometric or floral. In a second group the designs are composed of elaborate floral, animal or human motifs, normally arranged round a central boss or symmetrical about a central figure. The boss is either a plain hemisphere or protruding cone, more frequently a female face, or occasionally a lion-mask. The iconography of these fascinating pinheads, varying greatly in the skill of design and execution, has not yet been the subject of detailed study. Indeed, it would be premature until those from Dum Surkh are fully published. Neo-Elamite imagery is again clearly a very important source of inspiration. Intimately associated with these pinheads is a whole range of similarly decorated sheetmetal disks and vessels reported from LUiristdn, also awaiting systematic study. The fibulae from Lairistan (Calmeyer Group 46) have often been dismissed as late imports into Liris- tdn from the west haphazardly associated on the antiquities market with the other richly decorated bronzes from the region. Though it is probably correct to regard most of them as imports, it becomes increasingly apparent that their presence among collections of typical " Lfiristan Bronzes " is not wholly fortuitous. At Bdbd Jan a fragment of an anthropomorphic tube was stratified above two elbow fibulae.68 So far as I know no fibula has yet been reported with the cast bronze decoration characteristic of Lairistdn at this time. A small number of richly decorated elbow fibulae reported as from Loiristdn69 have exact parallels in Palestine in the later Neo-Assyrian period.v0 Since the figure represented on them bears a striking affinity to the Assyrian demon Pazuzu71 it is most probable that these fibulae were made in the seventh century either in Assyria itself or in a workshop under strong Assyrian influence, but not, as Mrs. Amiran suggested, in Lfristin itself. A bronze pendant Pazuzu-head was found at Nfish-i Jan72 in association with a plain elbow fibula. Evidence from other sites in central and western Iran indicates that the fibula was virtually unknown there, as in Mesopotamia, before the late eighth century B.C. and only became popular in the following two centuries.73 Though the number of fibulae so far published from LUristdn is still comparatively small their very existence urges caution in arguing too high a date for the end of the local industry. Although the fibulae were probably not made in the same workshops, their appearance in the seventh century presages the slow rundown in the production of elaborate straight garment pins. The numerous bronze bracelets with zoomorphic terminals from Ltiristdn are intimately linked to the zoomorphic pinheads, for identical designs are commonly used on both, and once again bronze and iron are occasionally combined. The excavations at Dum Surkh, where animal-headed bracelets first appeared in the ninth century level,74 make clear that this typological link indicates a common period of production. It may also be taken to show that the two categories of object were made in the same workshops. Only one cast bronze vessel75 and a single stand for a vessel76 in the style of the standard-finials has been published as from Lairistdn. All other vessels are raised from sheetmetal and sometimes decorated with cast bronze affixes. Of the vessels reported by far the greater number may now be attributed to the period from the tenth to the seventh centuries B.C. Apart from the very individual spouted vessels, whose Iranian origin seems unquestionable (Calmeyer's Group 47), there are many others whose form or decoration proclaims their western origin. Such vessels were reported in the earliest days of clandes- tine excavation and Vanden Berghe's excavations in a cemetery at War Kabud have yielded a whole range of others whose Neo-Babylonian or Neo-Assyrian affinities are immediately apparent."77 Calmeyer 67 M. van Loon, Bib.

Ironwork and chronology in Lfiristdn The intimate association of Lfiristdn's most typical cast bronze decoration and the pioneering phase of iron metallurgy in the same region has never been in doubt, since the two metals are occasionally used in the same object, notably the crescentic and spike-butted axes with iron-blades and decorated bronze shaft-holes (Calmeyer's Groups 33-4) and the elaborate bronze pinheads set on iron shanks (Class " B " pins: Schmidt's " wands "). Certain characteristic bronze types, particularly the flange- hilted daggers and some zoomorphic pinheads, have exact counterparts entirely of iron. A unique position is held by the well-known series of iron swords, mass produced to a standard pattern, with richly decorated hilts. Although the techniques used in their manufacture are now well understood, their date is still not firmly established through controlled excavations. Vanden Berghe has found iron flange- hilted swords with crescentic pommels, exactly modelled on bronze prototypes, in cemeteries in western Lfiristdn which he dates to the second half of the eighth or early seventh century B.C. At Chinan an iron sword was associated in a grave with a " Master-of-animals " finial.80 As the decorated iron swords characteristic of Lfiristdn since the earliest days of clandestine excavation there are, typologically speaking, only an elaboration of this basic form, using iron rather than bronze or bone for hilt inlay plates, they are unlikely to date much before c. 750 B.C. (Early Iron IIIA). Such a dating accords with other evidence for early ironwork in western Iran. At Hasanlu iron first appears in quantity, and bronze flange-hilted daggers are exactly reproduced in iron, in the later ninth century B.C.81 At Giyan iron is rare before level I(1), in the second half of the eighth century B.C., when 23% of the objects, including daggers, recovered from graves were of iron.82 At Dum Surkh iron had appeared by the later tenth century, but was four times more common by the seventh.83 At Guran a rare unplundered grave contained a skeleton with a bronze flange-hilted dagger, iron bracelet and a number of iron finger rings and two bronze spouted vessels similar to those in use at Sialk in the eighth century.84 A later grave contained a skeleton equipped with an iron sword and spearhead.85 At Bdba Jan the contexts of iron tools and weapons confirm their association with typical decorated Lfiristdn bronzes in Early Iron II-IIIA.86 The chronological range is the same at Sialk. In cemetery " A ", approximately contemporary with Hasanlu V, the only iron objects-a dagger blade and an arrowhead-appeared together in the same grave which may be later than the rest of the cemetery.87 In cemetery " B ", objects of bronze, bronze and iron, and entirely of iron all occur together. Conclusions: Calmeyer's methodical approach, and my brief, more general extension of it into less well-charted fields, makes clear, if it had ever really been in doubt, that there is no sense in which the term " Loiristan bronze " is meaningful. It is neither geographically nor culturally useful, conveying no more, often even less, than would such a phrase as " Egyptian " or " Syrian " bronze. Nor has it any chronological significance. Unfortunately, archaic terminology, particularly when reinforced by years of commercial exploitation, is virtually impossible to discard. Yet still a conscious attempt must be made to loosen the shackles. Each bronze object reported without context from western Iran must be taken singly, first united with others of comparable type to establish if possible its date and closest cultural affinities and only then attributed. Many will indeed be found to derive from Loiristin, but such a description will only be the most superficial. 7 P. Calmeyer, Berliner Jahrbuch V (1965), pp. I ff.; VI (1966), PP. 55 ff. 79 C.

Iooo/95o-650/600 B.C. in the period now generally described as " Early Iron II-IIIA ". But I doubt whether even these may be described as Lfiristdn bronzes in any useful sense. The little bronzework of this period published from controlled excavations in Lfiristan, from the region of Ilam in the west, through Dum Surkh and Tepe Guran, to Bibdt Jan and Giyan in the east, shows local variations, not so marked perhaps as the ceramic ones, but no less relevant to Ltiristdn's cultural history at the time. Forms and stylistic influences may be expected, if present trends continue, to follow predictable geographical bias, with Mesopotamian influences predominant in the west, Elamite in the south, and Iranian (in the widest sense of the word) in the north and north-east, to cite but the most obvious. Yet still, it was in this short period that workshops in and around Liiristin showed an independent creative spirit. Until standard-finials, zoomorphically decorated harness-rings, richly decorated cheekpieces for horse-bits, elaborate votive pins like those from Dum Surkh, and elaborately decorated iron swords are reported from outside this region these artefacts, made between c. 1000/95o-650/600 B.C. have good claim to be regarded as Liristdn's own peculiar contribution to the great tradition of metalworking in the ancient Near East. The general criticisms I have offered here should not be allowed to detract from Calmeyer's achievement; indeed they are a tribute to it. All students, and not a few collectors, of ancient Persian metalwork will be grateful for the range and clarity of his documentation. It is to be hoped that once his promised monograph on the decorated situlae (briefly considered in this book as Group 36) is com- pleted, he will be encouraged to move as systematically and comprehensively through the other sadly scattered products of Liiristmn's highly accomplished bronze workshops. 88 Professor Vanden Berghe's latest researches (Archeologia XXXVI, Sept.-Oct. 1970, pp. Io ff.) have revealed the direct association in one grave of a bronze spike-butted axe, bronze flange-hilted daggers and a bronze whetstone socket cast as a naturalistic caprid. This group probably belongs to the eleventh century B.C. (Early Iron I). It suggests that the caprid finials at least may have appeared during the latter part of Early Iron I, though comparable whetstones still appear at Susa in the Neo-Elamite period (R. Ghirshman, AJA 74 (1970), p. 223). More well-stocked gallery-graves of the middle and later third millennium B.C. have also been found.</page></plain_text>
