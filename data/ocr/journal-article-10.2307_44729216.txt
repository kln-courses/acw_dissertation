Cooper Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. ABSTRACT Laboratory testing measured the response of a 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer seatbelt buckle to impact on the back of the buckle. The peak acceleration, pulse duration and webbing tension were recorded to map the unique circumstances necessary to inertially unlatch the buckle. The conditions necessary to inertially unlatch the buckle in the laboratory were compared with the measured buckle responses in fifteen sled tests and six rollover crash tests using anthropomorphic dummies. All of the crash tested buckles remained latched and all had dynamic responses well below those required to produce inertial unlatching. Dummy hip areas were measured to be significantly stiffer than humans. Buckle accelerations measured in the "parlor trick" of intentionally striking the hip with a buckle are not representative of crash conditions. BACKGROUND Safety belt separations in crashes have been attributed to many causes such as cut webbing, fractured hardware, improper usage, inadvertent button activation, and inertial unlatching. This review focuses on the history of inertial unlatching. Cichowski (1963) reported that General Motors had "observed inertial opening characteristics of buckles" when testing on their new sled facility (Ref 1). The buckles tested were the lift cover type, not push-button release. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) developed a body block drop fixture in 1965, which resulted in push-button buckles inertially opening. Testing by seatbelt and vehicle manufacturers demonstrated that the CHP inertial release was caused by the buckle slapping into the body block during rebound with no load on the belt webbing. They concluded it was a condition resulting from the configuration of the test fixture and not representative of actual collisions. California officials subsequently agreed (Refs 2 and 4). In 1966 the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives conducted hearings on traffic safety. Ralph Nader testified that push- button buckles could be opened by entrapment between the abdomen and steering wheel during a crash. He also demonstrated inertial release by laying a buckle on the table and striking it. He labeled them "booby traps" (Ref 3). On behalf of automobile manufacturers, John Bugas of Ford testified that Ralph Nader's charges were unfounded. He referenced General Motors 1964 tests of the RCF-65 push- button buckles to determine if they "would unlatch under impact or inertial conditions." Body blocks had been accelerated into instrumented buckles on belts having various amounts of slack. None of the buckles opened despite buckle accelerations up to 105 g. He also cited Ford Motor Company tests at Wayne State University in 1965 to evaluate the effects of webbing slack on buckle inertial release. Cadavers and dummies had been tested at 25 mph impact velocities. They concluded, "In no case could the buckle be inertially unlatched because of belt slack." Mr. Bugas stated they had never seen one opened in any sled or crash test and had no accident reports of it happening. He labeled the inertial release a "parlor trick," claiming that it is unrelated to conditions in actual crashes (Refs 3 and 4). The National Bureau of Standards studied buckles from 1969 model year vehicles to determine whether a single standardized buckle release method should be prescribed in FMVSS 209. In 1971 they recommended that push-button buckles be required, citing convenience and a high level of reliability (Ref 5). Henderson (1973) reported an Australian rollover collision where a buckle "separated at impact." The type of buckle or cause of separation was not identified (Ref 6). In 1973 the New South Wales Motor Transport Department reported a series of tests to inertially release various buckles. A push-button buckle opened at about 100 g from a 20 ms pulse. They stated that the probability of such a pulse occurring in an accident is unknown. They concluded that the Australian standard should be amended to include an inertial test on buckles with a proposed level of 40 g for 30 ms (Ref 7). In 1978 the NHTSA investigated whether the buckle of a 1634</page><page sequence="2">1975 Chevrolet Monza could be inertially unlatched by striking with a rubber hammer or a spring-loaded plunger (Ref 8). They concluded that it could be, but that it was easier to open with zero lb. webbing tension than with 30 lb. (130 N) tension. Apparently no measurements of impact energy, velocity, or accelerations were undertaken. While noting that one buckle may have failed during a rollover crash, the NHTSA went on to survey 225 seatbelts from 1971 to 1978 model year cars for inertial release (Ref 9). They also impacted buckles with a spring-loaded plunger which was set to produce 300 g peak acceleration on belt assemblies with no web tension and 340 g on buckles with 30 lb. (130 N) of tension. Approximately one-third of the General Motors and Ford buckles opened and none of the Chrysler, AMC, or foreign buckles opened. The buckles were more likely to open if there was no web tension. They recommended that if further testing is conducted, a "more realistic force" simulating actual conditions be used. Finally, in 1979 the NHTS A in-house memorandum summarizing the Monza tests concluded that a buckle can be opened from a concentrated blow to its back side, but that it does not seem very probable it could receive such a blow during an accident. Further, "The absence of complaints about the malfunction would appear to support this point." They concluded, "The alleged defect does not appear to be a common problem, and no further investigation is warranted at the present time" (Ref 10). The NHTSA Vehicle Research and Test Center (1992) reported on a test program similar to the study we are presenting here. They determined the dynamic conditions necessary to inertially unlatch some Nissan, Ford, and GM buckles. They compared those unlatching results with six crash tests where seatbelt buckle accelerations and concurrent webbing loads were measured. They concluded that conditions required to open a buckle are not achievable in real accidents because of the small distances that exist between occupants and properly worn safety belt buckles (Ref 11). In November 1992, the NHTSA announced the results of their investigation regarding a petition from the Institute for Injury Reduction for a safety recall and rulemaking to deal with the alleged defect of inertial release. Following an extensive investigation, they found "absolutely no basis" for the allegation and stated it is not a phenomenon associated with real world crashes (Ref 12). Collision Safety Engineering (1993) analyzed the mechanics of inertial release for 10 different seatbelt buckles. They found that the static button release force increases linearly with webbing tension. They noted that for inertial release to occur dynamically, there must be low webbing tension and sufficient acceleration pulse amplitude and duration to move the latch the required distance for releasing. Through static testing, they found the Hybrid III dummy to be significantly stiffer than human subjects in the hip area. They concluded that there is no cause for the motoring public to be concerned about the safety of side-mounted push-button- type buckles (Ref 13). Arndt (1993) recognized two basic pieces of information were missing to determine the likelihood of inertial release. Needed first was a set of well-defined input conditions required to cause buckle release. Secondly, they noted the need for data reporting the acceleration histories of buckles in real-world crashes. Some laboratory conditions for release were provided through their drop fixture testing with various instrumented buckles (Ref 14). INTRODUCTION The possibility of opening some seatbelt buckles by intentionally striking the back of the buckle has been recognized for at least 30 years. The absence of this occurrence in thousands of sled and crash tests, however, has led to widespread belief that inertial release is either impossible or extremely unlikely to occur in actual crashes. Despite the historical lack of buckle inertial releases being observed in crash tests, new attention has been brought to inertial opening of seatbelt buckles. There is a need for a better understanding of the buckle impact conditions necessary for release to actually occur. Simply demonstrating that a buckle can be inertially opened by intentionally striking it does not demonstrate whether this can occur in actual vehicle crashes. The research described here encompasses and expands that previously reported by Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. and Moffatt et al (Refs 15 and 16). The work defines the laboratory impact conditions necessary to cause a specific seatbelt buckle design to inertially unlatch due to impact on the back of the buckle. These conditions are compared with the accelerations measured in full-scale crash and sled tests. It is only through quantified comparisons of the buckle impacts measured in actual crashes with those impacts required for buckle release in the laboratory that one can judge the likelihood of inertial release. The buckle used for all of this testing was the RCF-67, which is also known as the "Type 1" or "Minibuckle" manufactured by TRW (referred to as "Type 1" hereafter). It has a steel frame enclosing a pivoting latch held closed by a spring. When inserted into the buckle, the latch plate engages a pawl in the spring-loaded latch, preventing withdrawal. When the button is depressed 1.8 to 2.5 mm, it pivots the latch, causing release of the latch plate. Figure 1 illustrates the buckle. Figure 1: Type 1 TRW RCF-67 buckle 1635</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2: High-speed film sequence of buckle impact; pendulum impact direction from right to left The inertial release properties of this seatbelt buckle were analyzed in the Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. (FaAA) Test and Engineering Center (TEC) laboratory with high-speed filming of a pendulum impact to its back. With the side of the buckle cut away, and the internal parts painted for better visibility, the inertial release of the buckle was filmed at 7,000 frames per second. Figure 2 is a sequence from the high-speed film showing the motion of the buckle frame moving due to the pendulum impact while the light-colored latch remains stationary. In this test, the mass of the button was not a factor in inertially moving the latch, because the button tab lagged behind the movement of the latch (Figure 2c). Tension in the seatbelt webbing greatly increases the magnitude of the acceleration pulse required to cause inertial release by increasing the friction between the latch pawl and the latch plate detent. For one TRW Type 1 buckle tested, with 13 N belt tension, the static force required to depress the button to the point of release was about 23 N. When the webbing tension was increased to 102 N, the button force required for release increased to approximately 53 N, and at 190 N tension, the button release load was approximately 67 N. In order to inertially unlatch the buckle without direct contact to the button, the button release force must be produced by the resultant dynamic force that results from accelerating the moving parts (latch, spring, and button). This requires sharply accelerating the buckle frame toward the button with sufficient magnitude to actuate the latch mechanism. Even small webbing tensions essentially preclude inertial release because the accelerations required for release are too high. FULL-SCALE ROLLOVER TESTS A series of six full-scale FMVSS 208 dolly-type rollovers was conducted at FaAA TEC using a 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer (Figure 3). The front bucket seat occupants had a 1636</page><page sequence="4">dummy was seated in a normal position and photographed. The pretest lap belt tension for all dummies was determined solely by the retractor spring tension. There was no cinching of the lap belts. The front torso belt comfort feature was engaged to the first position, resulting in light chest contact. three-point lap/shoulder belt system with two inertia-locking retractors, fixed latch plate, and a windowshade-style comfort feature on the torso belt. The front buckles were mounted at the inboard side of the front seats through a floor-mounted anchor connected to the buckle by webbing enclosed in a plastic sheath. The two rear occupant seating positions were fitted with lap belts only. The rear seatbelt buckles were mounted outboard of the seat positions. The rear retractors were center-mounted and could be operated in either the inertia-locking or automatic-locking mode. For these tests, the automatic-locking feature was defeated on the rear lap belts, so all tests were conducted using the inertia-locking mode. Figure 3: 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer on rollover dolly Prior to testing, all glazing was removed from the vehicle, and internal rollcages were installed in the occupant compartment and under the front of the hood. Two onboard high-speed cameras filmed the motion of the seatbelt buckles for the front and rear occupants. Offboard photography included high-speed and real-time cameras. Vehicle accelerations were measured with triaxial accelerometers mounted on the floor near the base of each B-pillar. The seatbelt instrumentation included FaAA-designed low-load webbing load cells stitched into the center front of the lap belt webbing (Figure 4). These load cells become overload protected at a limit of approximately 900 N and were calibrated in the range of 0-445 N. In the rollover tests, no measurements were taken of the front occupants' torso belt tensions. The seatbelt buckle accelerations were measured using damped 1,000-g Entran accelerometers, model EGAX- 1000, mounted on an aluminum bridge affixed to the buckle over its center of gravity (Figure 5). The accelerometers were oriented to measure positive accelerations in the direction to cause inertial actuation of the latch mechanism. The accelerometer and belt tension data was acquired using an onboard transient data recorder with 2 kHz analog anti- aliasing filtering and a 10 kHz per channel data acquisition rate. Subsequent processing added SAE Class 600 filtering. Each test included four anthropomorphic dummies. The left front and left rear seat positions were occupied by 50th- percentile Hybrid II male dummies, each with a seated pelvis. The right front seat held a 95th-percentile male Hybrid III dummy with a seated pelvis. In the right rear was a six-year- old child dummy with a seated/standing pelvis. There was no instrumentation in the dummies. Prior to each test, each Figure 4: Load cell installation at center of lap belt Figure 5: Accelerometer bridge on center of gravity of buckle The same vehicle was used for all six rollover tests, with some minor body repair and axle replacement after some of the tests. The same seatbelts were used for all six tests, and all of the tests were conducted on flat asphalt. The rollover test conditions are shown in Table 1.

With four dummies in each test, there were a total of 73 dummy-rolls. All of the seatbelts operated properly in all of the tests, and there were no releases of any buckles. 1637</page><page sequence="5">Figuře 6 graphically presents the results of a typical test. The upper drawing illustrates the vehicle orientation at each ground impact. This rollover sequence was determined through high-speed film analysis which was correlated with the vehicle acceleration measurements. The upper data trace provides the resultant acceleration of the average of the right and left B-pillar/floor accelerometers. This trace indicates that most of the vehicle-to-ground impact peak accelerations were in the range of 5 - 15 g, interspersed with airborne periods where there were no significant floor pan accelerations. The second trace in Figure 6 shows the lap belt tension which was measured for the left front dummy. Film analysis demonstrates that the dummy moved upward and outboard from its seated position during the rolling airborne phases, resulting in typical measured webbing tensions of 200 - 650 N. Roof-to-ground impacts generally moved the dummy tighter into the lap belt (depending on the vehicle orientation), causing higher webbing tensions (such as at 0.55 sec and 1.6 sec). The wheel-to-ground impacts generally moved the dummy downward and laterally relative to the vehicle, and usually resulted in lower webbing tensions, depending upon the vehicle orientation and the resultant direction of movement of the dummy. Plotted beneath the webbing tension graph in Figure 6 is the acceleration trace for the left front buckle. Positive accelerations are in the direction of inertial depression of the button. This graph shows that the only significant buckle impact occurred as a result of a right wheels-to-ground impact. At about 2.3 sec, the right wheels (the "leading" side wheels) struck the ground, resulting in approximately a 10 g vehicle acceleration. The resultant movement of the left front dummy (which was seated on the side of the vehicle opposite the wheels striking the ground) caused a buckle peak acceleration of 62 g coincident with a 219 N webbing tension. Figure 6: Example of rollover test results 1638</page><page sequence="6">A similar analysis was conducted for all impacts for all of the dummies in each of the six rollover tests. Every buckle acceleration exceeding 20 g was analyzed. The 20 g threshold for inclusion in analysis was selected to include most discrete pulses and yet eliminate insignificant vibrations. Table 2 is a summary of the most significant buckle impacts in the rollover tests. For those impacts where there were several buckle vibrations over 20 g associated with a single vehicle-to-ground impact, only the most severe impact is noted here. As shown in Table 2, from the multitude of vehicle-to- ground impact orientations in these six rollover tests, essentially all of the significant buckle impacts occurred when the leading wheels struck the ground. This impact orientation caused dummy movement which maximized the combination of increased buckle acceleration and low webbing tension. The other vehicle-to-ground impact orientations (such as roof-to-ground) typically resulted in higher webbing tensions or lower buckle accelerations. The most severe buckle impact in the six rollover tests was in Test E, when the right front dummy impacted the buckle, causing a 118 g peak acceleration with a concurrent 90 N webbing tension. Figure 7 illustrates this impact, where the Blazer had a substantial airborne leap before landing hard on its leading side rocker/ffame/suspension. The resulting floor pan acceleration from this impact was 28.5 g, which was easily the most severe vehicle impact measured in any of the rollover tests. This ground impact was unusually severe because the left rear axle had been broken off in a previous roll during that same test, so there was no wheel and suspension to provide ride down. The onboard film analysis and the webbing load measurements show that there was low tension in the lap belt webbing prior to this impact as the right front dummy moved from the right to the left side of its bucket seat area within the confines of the seatbelt. As the dummy impacted the left side of the lap belt loop, the webbing tension increased from approximately 30 N to 300 N.

A 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer body was mounted on the FaAA deceleration-type sled. This vehicle was similar to the rollover test vehicle, except that its original equipment included a center front console. The sled tests were run at 16, 32, and 48 kph nominal impact speeds at each of five different vehicle orientations: rear impact, left rear impact, left side impact, left front impact, and frontal impact. The sled deceleration pulses were designed to simulate the crash pulses in frontal, side, and rear impacts for the S-10 Blazer. For the sled tests, the right front dummy was a 5th- percentile female, the right rear was the six-year-old child dummy, the left front was a 95th-percentile male Hybrid III, and the left rear was a 50th-percentile male Hybrid II. Each had a seated pelvis except the child dummy. The dummy and seatbelt pretest positioning was similar to the rollovers, where the lap belt tension was determined by the retractor tension and the front torso belt comfort feature was engaged at its first position, resulting in light chest contact. The same seatbelt instrumentation was used as in the rollover series, except that an additional load transducer was placed on the front torso belts slightly above the inboard hip. Onboard and offboard cameras documented each test. Some seats and seatbelts were replaced after certain tests due to damage. The center console was broken loose in Test 2C and not replaced.

As in the rollover analysis, for each vehicle impact only the most significant buckle impact for each dummy is shown in the table. All of the seatbelts operated properly, and none of the buckles inertially unlatched in any of the 60 dummy-tests (four dummies times fifteen tests). The webbing tension for the front belts in Table 3 is the approximate vector sum of the lap and torso belt loads. Several observations may be made from the results of the sled tests in Table 3. First, the lateral and lateral-rear impacts were more apt to have buckle accelerations over 20 g in combination with lower web tensions than other impact directions. In the frontal and frontal-oblique impacts the dummy movement put tension into the webbing early in the collision before any significant buckle accelerations occurred. Second, the higher impact speeds did not necessarily result in higher buckle accelerations. Also, the location of the buckle relative to the dummy (i.e., buckle-leading-dummy or buckle- trailing-dummy) did not have any significant effect. Finally, dummy size had no significant effect on the results as all the dummies were essentially of infinite mass relative to the buckle. The two most severe buckle impacts in the sled test series occurred in the pure lateral impacts (Tests 3A and 3B). In both cases the left rear buckle (which is mounted on the outboard side of the duriimy) was driven by the pelvis of the dummy into the upholstery-covered left rear wheel well. 1640</page><page sequence="8">Table 3: Sled Data Summary Buckle Pulse Event Dummy Peak Duration Min.

LABORATORY TESTS The impact conditions required to inertially unlatch the test buckles were measured in the laboratory. Low-speed impacts were performed by striking the buckle with a pendulum, while higher-speed impacts utilized a shock table. The pendulum consisted of a 4-kg metal cylinder suspended by four wire ropes. Rubber pads were attached to the nose of the pendulum to produce acceleration pulses of different durations, and the drop height of the pendulum was adjusted to produce the variable peak buckle accelerations. Belt tension was applied by hanging weights vertically on the latch plate side of the buckle. A wire cable was attached to the rear of the pendulum to stop its forward motion after contact with the buckle back. Figure 9 shows the pendulum apparatus.

Two additional Type 1 buckles were tested at medium pulse durations at the same belt tensions but at fewer pendulum heights, simply to obtain the lowest peak accelerations which would release them at those belt tensions. It was not possible to obtain high-amplitude acceleration pulses with the medium-duration rubber pad, so these tests were necessarily conducted at lower belt tensions and higher pendulum heights than the short-duration tests in order to obtain impacts sufficiently severe to result in buckle release. Acceleration pulses of 6 ms or longer were difficult to create with the pendulum because the compression of a softer foam rubber pad on the impacting surface of the pendulum became too large for these long-duration pulses. A shock table, capable of producing 1 - 10 ms duration acceleration pulses, was designed and fabricated to supplement the pendulum test fixture for higher-speed impacts. The shock table consists of a buckle carrier mounted on a drop table guided by linear bearings. A schematic representation of the fixture and buckle carrier is presented in Figure 10. The primary velocity of the table is provided by four elastomeric bands, allowing an impact velocity of over 80 kph. The deceleration pulse is produced by stopping the table with a set of commercial shock table elastomers. This system is capable of producing 10 ms duration half-sine pulses of nearly 600 g peak amplitude. The buckle is supported in the carrier by the full contact area of the buckle frame back and held in place with two lateral clamps. The clamping force necessary to hold the buckle in contact with the back support is minimal and does not affect the function of the test buckle. Simulated belt tension is provided by a small elastomer attached to the latch plate and is reacted through a lip at the buckle latch plate inlet and not by the two clamps. The tension elastomer provides the energy necessary to extract the latch plate from the buckle when the latch pawl clears the detent. Comparison tests between the pendulum test fixture and the shock table were performed, and the same buckles tested on both fixtures produced similar results. 1642</page><page sequence="10">Figure 10: Shock table fixture Six Type 1 seatbelt buckles were characterized on the shock table with long (nominally 8-10 ms) pulse durations, each at three nominal belt tensions. Similar data acquisition and processing techniques were used for the crash testing and laboratory tests, except that the minimum event belt tension is used for the crash test data, while the nominal belt tension is used for the laboratory test data. The results of the laboratory tests are presented in the next section. LABORATORY AND CRASH TEST COMPARISON Figures 11, 12, and 13 show the laboratory "mapping" of the conditions necessary for inertial release along with the results of all of the sled and rollover tests, including the less significant events above the 20 g threshold. Each of the three graphs represents a different set of pulse durations. Figure 11 gives the results of the short-duration laboratory tests and crash tests for 1-2 ms pulse durations. The laboratory data is grouped in three columns at the three nominal webbing tensions (5 N, 183 N, and 361 N), indicated by the vertical lines; individual belt buckles are horizontally separated along the abscissa to avoid overlapping. Whether a buckle released at each impact level in a laboratory test is designated by a "Y" (for "Yes") or an "o" (for "No"). The location of the lowest "Y" on the figure shows the lowest peak acceleration for a given webbing tension and pulse duration where a specific buckle released in the laboratory. The "Possible Release" shaded area indicates the lowest release peak acceleration level recorded for the buckles tested in the data set. Figure 12 is a similar map of the 2-6 ms pulse duration crash test data with the medium-duration laboratory test data at 5 N, 94 N, and 183 N belt tensions, and Figure 13 shows the &gt;6 ms pulse duration crash test data and long-duration laboratory data at 13 N, 93 N, and 182 N belt tensions. Note that Tables 2 and 3 include only the most severe crash test impacts, while Figures 11, 12, and 13 include all crash test events over 20 g for the specified durations. These graphs illustrate the magnitude of the peak buckle accelerations measured in the full-scale crash tests and the laboratory conditions that were found to be necessary for inertial release for three nominal pulse durations. All of the crash test buckle impact severities were well below the "possible release" line. 1643</page><page sequence="11">&lt;L&gt; T3 I I W) 0 es Ih 1 T3 S CO Ë &lt;N I CO tì 0 1 P &lt;D co â &lt;S co 73 co a to s 1 "Ö § fc&gt; I I hJ ▼H rH .1 £ 1644</page><page sequence="12">u 1 ! bo 0 CS 1 1 co 6 V£&gt; I cs co Ö 0 1 •§ &lt;D co t s co 1 8 ■+-» co &lt;D co § T3 § b 1 I J CS rH « a £ 1645</page><page sequence="13">o ã ļ bû 0 es ¡ 1 co 6 VO A CO e O 1 •s &lt;D co 1 iü co 3 . co &lt;D Vh co 5 j=¡ CO 2 0 T3 1 6 O o •s hJ ¿î .1 te 1646</page><page sequence="14">HUMAN AND DUMMY HIP IMPACT TESTS All of the sled and rollover tests utilized standard automotive crash test dummies which are designed to replicate particular human characteristics. Although each dummy has a human-like aluminum pelvis covered with soft vinyl foam, the dynamic force deflection biofidelity of the pelvic area flesh in the seatbelt buckle area has not been verified to replicate human flesh. James (Ref 13) addressed the relative stiffness sof humans and dummies by measuring the static force deflection characteristics of the hip area of a Hybrid III dummy and humans. He found the dummy to be "two to three times stiffer than humans." Human soft tissue is viscoelastic in nature, so its compliance is dependent upon the rate of loading. To measure the relative dynamic stiffness of the hip area of humans and the test dummies, FaAA developed a calibrated, spring-loaded hip impactor. This device, shown schematically in Figure 14, projects a properly ballasted TRW Type 1 buckle housing at known velocities and measures the buckle acceleration using the same instrumentation as used in the full-scale crash tests. Twenty-seven human volunteers and four test dummies (95th-percentile male Hybrid III seated pelvis, 50th-percentile male Hybrid II seated pelvis, 5th-percentile female Hybrid III seated pelvis, and six-year-old child seated/standing pelvis) were the subjects used to compare dynamic response to impact in the hip area. Figure 14: Hip impactor Figure 15 illustrates the four impact locations. Point 1 was the anterior superior spine of the ilium, which is an easily identifiable landmark on both humans and dummies. Point 2 was the greater trochanter, which is the lateral knob on the top of the femur. Dummies do not have trochanters, so this location was determined by measuring the same impact area as on a human. It generally fell at the dummy H-point. Point 3 was located halfway between Points 1 and 2, which generally corresponds with the fold between the wall of the abdomen and the top of the thigh. Point 4 was a point on the lateral buttock located by making an equilateral triangle with Points 1 and 2 with the subject seated. The human subjects were all employees of FaAA TEC in Phoenix, Arizona, who were available during the two days of testing. Each was tested with whatever clothing they were wearing, which tended to be lightweight, since it was summertime in Arizona. No selection was made regarding body type, so the tests provide a diverse sample of human volunteers. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the subjects tested.

All buckles were projected normal to the surface of the test point. Three impacts were conducted at each point at an impact velocity of 13 km/h, which resulted in average buckle accelerations in the range of 50 to 150 g for the human subjects. The test results were analyzed by comparing the peak accelerations measured by the projected buckle into the human hips with those into the dummy hips. The results for each impact area are summarized in Table 6. At each impact location, the dummy average peak acceleration was greater than the human average. However, some people had higher peak accelerations than some dummies in some locations. Averaging the four hip impact points, the dummy peak acceleration was 185 g compared with the human average of 98 g (Figure 16). The dummy hip area tends to be significantly stiffer than the average person under these impact conditions. Table 6: Hip Impact Comparison Point Human Dummy No. Description Avg.

As expected, increased layers of clothing greatly softened the impact. For example, for Subject #01 at Point 1, the average peak acceleration was reduced approximately 50% by the addition of a cotton sweater.

The term is descriptive because the "parlor trick" is amazing to lay persons who first witness it. However, measurement of the forces in the typical "parlor trick" demonstrates that it is not representative of the forces in actual crashes. For this study a series of "parlor trick" impacts was conducted by two subjects (E. A. Moffatt and E. R. Cooper) striking an instrumented buckle against themselves at the anterior superior spine area of the ilium. The buckle was also struck by a VHS video cassette case. As in the crash tests, the webbing tension adjacent to the latch plate and the buckle accelerations were measured. The buckle used in these " parlor tricks" had been previously tested on the laboratory shock table, so its release level was well-defined. As predicted by the laboratory testing, only those impacts with sufficiently high acceleration and low webbing tension opened the buckle. Of particular interest, however, was the ease by which the seemingly mild " parlor trick" could far exceed any of the buckle impacts measured in any of the rollover or sled tests. Figure 17 is a bar graph showing the most significant buckle impacts measured in all of the full-scale crash tests and the peak accelerations from all of the "parlor trick" tests. All of the most significant crash test events with a measured belt tension below 445 N are shown. The numbers beneath the "parlor trick" results refer to the order in which they were performed. The severity of the buckle impacts which were sufficient to cause inertial unlatching in these " parlor tricks" is far more severe than any buckle impact in any of the crash tests. A videotape to demonstrate the relative severity of the crash tests and "parlor trick" tests was prepared to show all of the impacts in real time (Ref 17). Observations of the "parlor trick" tests in comparison with the crash results shown in Figure 17 demonstrate why intentionally hitting a buckle on the back side is a misrepresentation of typical real- world crash conditions. DISCUSSION The full-scale crash tests provide information regarding the forces on the 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer seatbelts and buckles in a broad range of crash configurations. Other vehicles will not necessarily produce the same buckle forces due to differences in the seats and seatbelt installations, and due to human variations such as anatomical differences, clothing, seat position and how the belt is worn. The "possible release" conditions measured by these laboratory buckle tests are specific for this TRW Type 1 buckle/latch plate assembly. Different design buckles and those from other manufacturers will not necessarily be similar. 800 -] - "Parlor Tricks" □ Release H Non-Release 600 --- - i i u&gt; c 500 - - - - O V» (D k- &lt;D n -q5 &lt;D 400 - - n n - ° n U n &lt; 300 - - ir CD OL 200 - || • ji 100 j- - - - - • - I 0 llllnnl mil illllil illllii illi lilii lim il I All Six Sled Sled Sled Sled 123456 123 123456 Rollovers Rear Left Rear Left Side Left Front Front M ° ff a Video Leading Leading Leading Leading Leading M ° ff a Cassette °°Per Figure 17: The most significant crash test impacts and all "parlor trick" results 1649</page><page sequence="17">The methods of data collection and processing used in this research were in accordance with SAE J211 specifications with the exception of the filter class on the belt load measurements. All belt load channels were filtered at SAE Class 600 for a more consistant comparison with the Class 600 acceleration channels. Additionally, FaAA found it necessary to use mechanically damped accelerometers to properly measure the accelerations experienced by the buckles. The relatively high natural frequency of the buckle assemblies tested in this research were found to be of sufficient levels to produce erroneous data if undamped accelerometers were employed. Caution should be used in making comparisons between the results presented here and the results obtained at other laboratories. Adherence to the SAE recommended practices and the use of properly mechanically damped accelerometers are necessary if comparisons are to be valid. CONCLUSIONS The necessary conditions for inertially unlatching the TRW Type 1 buckle were documented in the laboratory. The six rollover and fifteen sled tests provided a range of vehicle impact configurations and severities to evaluate the potential for these inertial release conditions to occur in 1984 Chevrolet S-10 Blazers. None of the crash tests came close to inertially unlatching any of the buckles. The significant differences between the conditions necessary for release compared with those measured in the crash tests indicate why it is extremely unlikely that a TRW Type 1 buckle will inertially unlatch in similar vehicle collisions.
