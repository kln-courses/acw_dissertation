<plain_text><page sequence="1">404 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) Allison de Fren Technofetishism and the Uncanny Desires of A.S.F.R. (alt.sex.fetish.robots) The interfusion of technology and sexuality - particularly when it takes the form of an artificial woman - has been an explosive combination, dating back to Pandora, the first artificial woman in literature. Hesiod tells us that Pandora was molded from clay by Hephaestus and endowed with desirable attributes by all the gods, at the behest of Zeus, who wished to punish men for the gift of fire that Prometheus had given them after stealing its secret from the heavens. The stolen fire has inspired various interpretations, many of which suggest a form of human knowledge or technics; thus, the artificial woman was meant to void the progress made from Prometheus' s gift. Although Pandora was a "wonder" to behold, she was "sheer guile" (described with the oxymoronic kaldn kak√≤n or "beautiful evil"), an irresistible and deceptive exterior masking a secret horror in the form of a box (or jar) containing sickness, toil, and sorrow. On the orders of Zeus, Hermes offered Pandora as a gift to Prometheus' s more gullible brother Epimetheus, who was so entranced by her beauty that he forgot to heed Prometheus' s warning to beware all gifts from the king of the gods. And so Pandora entered the human realm and, soon thereafter, incited by curiosity, she opened the box, releasing pain and suffering into the world. While the Pandora myth is an early reflection of and on the intersection of technics, knowledge, and desire, its indictment of women has been its enduring legacy. As Laura Mulvey notes, Pandora is the first in a long history of femme- fatale androids - creatures in which "a beautiful surface that is appealing and charming to man masks either an 'interior' that is mechanical or an outside that is deceitful"; this "inside/outside topography" connotes "mystery" and is "only readable in death" (55). While she mentions the fabricated women in Villiers de I' Isle- Adam' s novel Tomorrow's Eve (L'Eve future, 1886), E.T.A. Hoffmann's story "The Sandman" ("Der Sandmann," 1816), and Fritz Lang' s film Metropolis (1927), one might extrapolate from such early examples to those female WMDs that were a common trope of twentieth-century sf media, typified by the female- android-cum-nuclear- warhead in the 1991 film Eve of Destruction and the villainous fembots who took on Jaime Sommers in the original Bionic Woman television series (1976-78). They were brought to a parodie extreme by their "bikini machine" and "girl bomb" counterparts in the Dr. Goldfoot (1965, 1966) and Austin Powers (1997, 2002) films. Such creatures both literalize the notion of the sexual bombshell while seeming to corroborate Andreas Huyssen's proposition that within European modernism female sexuality and technology become analogues: As soon as the machine came to be perceived as a demonic, inexplicable threat and as harbinger of chaos and destruction - a view which typically characterizes many 19th-century reactions to the railroad to give but one major example</page><page sequence="2">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 405 - writers began to imagine the Maschinenmensch as woman. There are grounds to suspect that we are facing here a complex process of projection and displacement. The fears and perceptual anxieties emanating from ever more powerful machines are recast and reconstructed in terms of the male fear of female sexuality, reflecting, in the Freudian account, the male' s castration anxiety. (70) Mulvey attempts to recuperate the iconography of Pandora and her box from its misogynist legacy by framing it within the context of psychoanalytic feminist theory. In her essay "Pandora's Box: Topographies of Curiosity," she employs Pandora's curious gaze as an intervening agent in the closed circuit that she describes, in her influential 1975 article "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," between the gaze of the cinematic spectator, understood as both active and masculine, and the passive female image that serves as its object. There is, Mulvey suggests, a self-reflexivity at work in the curious gaze (a gaze often coded as female), a desire to know that is "associated with enclosed, secret, and forbidden spaces" representative of female interiority. So when Pandora looks inside the box, a hidden space that many have read as a synecdoche for female sexuality, she is interrogating the site/sight of sexual difference that she herself represents. Thus, the curious gaze as epistemophilia (the desire to know) serves as a challenge to fetishistic scopophilia (the desire to see, but not to know) through which the female image is constituted as a sight or "surface that conceals": While curiosity is a compulsive desire to see and to know, to investigate something secret, fetishism is born out of a refusal to see, a refusal to accept the difference the female body represents for the male. These complex series of turns away, of covering over, not of the eyes but of understanding, of fixating on a substitute object to hold the gaze, leave the female body as an enigma and threat, condemned to return as a symbol of anxiety while simultaneously being transformed into its own screen in representation. (64) While Mulvey draws a binary distinction between knowledge and desire in an attempt to reclaim the "inside/outside topography" of the artificial female, other critics have questioned the relevance of both topographical and corporeal binarisms, as well as the epistemology of fetishism, in relation to both cyberbodies and the crisis of representation within the postmodern imaginary. Thomas Foster, for example, reflecting on the sexy robots and gynoids of the Japanese artist, Hajime Sorayama (see figure 1), asks whether their explicit foregrounding of both technology and sexuality is reducible to traditional ideas around fetishistic disavowal: "If anything, these images represent technology as the truth of sexuality, and this inversion of the modernist tradition Huyssen defines produces anxieties that cannot be entirely or safely framed by the fetishism the images evoke" (101).1 If such technofetishistic imagery undercuts the psychoanalytic model of fetishism, however, it is by pushing "the logic of fetishism to a point of crisis" (Foster 98), inspiring an ambivalence and confusion that has haunted technologically-mediated bodies ever since Donna Haraway first suggested their critical potential in her "Cyborg Manifesto" (1985). Although Haraway heralded</page><page sequence="3">406 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) Figure 1 : Gynoid by Hajime Sorayama the possibilities of both "cyborg writing" and "cyborg imagery" for offering "a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves" (181), many critics have noted the difficulty of realizing a simultaneously female and post-gendered body, particularly in the visual field. Claudia Springer, for example, draws attention to the cyberbodies in film and cyberpunk sf, which "appear masculine or feminine to an exaggerated degree. We find giant pumped-up pectoral muscles on the males and enormous breasts on the females" (66). Similarly, Anne Balsamo comments on the extent to which gender remains one of the more resilient markers of difference in the portrayal of technologically enhanced bodies: As is often the case when seemingly stable boundaries are displaced by technological innovation (human/artificial, life/death, nature/culture), other boundaries are more vigilantly guarded. Indeed, the gendered boundary between male and female is one border that remains heavily guarded despite new technologized ways to rewrite the physical body in the flesh. (9) Although for Haraway "cyborg sex" conjures "the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism)" (150), its visual interpretation seems to align more readily with the cyborgian nightmare depicted in Shinya Tsukamoto's cyberpunk film Tetsuo (1989), in which a salaryman becomes perforated from the inside out by rapidly advancing metallic probes, whose mutating offshoots converge into a gigantic power drill with which he impales his lover. While Tetsuo offers a hyperbolic (and humorous) example of the technofetishistic imaginary, it also underscores an interpretive dilemma in relation to the technological displacement of bodies and sexualities in the visual field: are they to be understood as compensatory or strategic? Do we read the metallic "member" as an avowal or a return of the repressed, phallocentrism or a commentary on phallocentrism? Foster notes similar confusion around Sorayama' s robotic and cyborg bodies: "these images make it impossible to determine whether the sexy robot is a fetish object or a woman who has been fetishized" (102). Moreover, he points out that, even when the technological mediation of bodies destabilizes traditional categories of gender and sexuality, it is difficult to escape the feedback loop of castration anxiety since "fetishism paradoxically uses ambivalence and a blurring of gender or sexual categories to defend against the anxieties created by the breakdown of such</page><page sequence="4">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 407 categories" (82). The ability to maintain the kind of ironic stance encouraged by Haraway in relation to technofetishistic imagery, as Foster notes, thus "seems to depend on the assumption that this technology and its popular imaging will not or cannot be 'psychoanarytically framed'" (98). Foster points to the work of E.L. McCallum as a potential starting point for approaching technofetishism outside of the Freudian model. McCallum proposes a reconsideration of the discourse around fetishism, which, she reminds us, came of age with modernism and, particularly, with the rise of sexology, as a means of marking sexual differences and making categorical distinctions between the normative and deviant. She notes that while fetishism, within its narrow definition as a fixation, seems to work in opposition to the crisis of representation within postmodernity, "[t]his view reflects the fact that fetishism itself has come to be fetishized" (xv) - that is, fixed in meaning in a way that offers little theoretical wiggle room. By thinking through the fetishistic relationship - in which pleasure is courted despite "ambivalence, indeterminacy, and contradiction" - rather than merely about the fetish object, McCallum suggests that, far from serving as a screen against epistemophilia, fetishism can provide an alternative epistemological model for exploring the connections between subjects and objects, desire and knowledge (xvi). In this essay, I follow the lead of both Foster and McCallum in an attempt to think through the technofetishistic relationship with the machine woman, as well as about the visual representations of machine bodies that are an outgrowth ofthat relationship, using as a springboard a little-known community of technosexuals with whom I have had contact, on and off, for nearly a decade.2 It was an act of Pandora-like curiosity that first led me to the community: spurred by the saying that "if you enter any object in a search engine followed by the word 'sex,' you will find people who fetishize that object," I typed "robot" and "sex" into a search engine and, sure enough, found websites created by groups of people who collectively fantasize about, among other things, robots (many of whom found one another in the same way that I found them). While some do refer to themselves as "technosexuals," many call the fetish itself A.S.F.R., an acronym for alt.sex.fetish.robots, the name of the now-defunct Usenet newsgroup where members originally congregated online. Although A.S.F.R. was made possible by the advent of virtual communities, its fetishistic interests have historical antecedents that were documented in the early literature of sexology. Against their classifications of similar fetishistic practices as variations of necrophilia, as well as subsequent Freudian interpretations, I will argue that A.S.F.R. is less about technology in general, or the artificial woman in particular, than it is a strategy of denaturalization that uses the trope of technological "programming" to underscore subjecthood. Like the trope of "hardwiring" - which Foster discusses as a signal within cyberpunk of the constitution of bodies and identities in relation to "preexisting systems of control and power, as figured" for example "by the invisible computer network of Neuromancef s cyberspace" (74) - "programming" serves as a metaphor for the biological and cultural matrices within which desire is articulated and pursued. "ASFRians" experience pleasure and agency through, in a sense, hacking the system, the visual indicators of which often take the form</page><page sequence="5">408 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) of a female android who has run amok - an image that, in Freudian terms, emblematizes male castration anxiety. A.S.F.R. thus complicates the binary relationship between fetishism and curiosity proposed by Mulvey, while corroborating Foster's claim that technofetishistic imagery has the potential to foreground "the problematic status of psychoanalytic categories and arguments within technocultural contexts" (95). I argue that in its attempt to unmask the artificial body (through physical breakdown), the ASFRian gaze is less aligned to fetishistic scopophilia - the desire to see but not to know, which is generally read in relation to the cohesive male subject - than with the self-reflexive curiosity of Pandora, the desire to see beneath the seen. Indeed, it embodies the etymological essence of curiosity as cura, the Latin word for care, which vacillates between its usage as a noun (meaning anxiety or sorrow) and a verb (meaning to provide relief or ministration). Curiosity often involves looking at that which causes anxiety rather than pleasure, and thus it stems from an impulse different from the visual delectation of the beautiful image. St. Augustine pejoratively referred to it as "the eyes' urges" in his Confessions, explaining that while the beautiful inspires the body to delight in sensual pleasures, curiositas "experiments with their opposites, not submitting to the gross for its own sake, but from the drive to experience and know" (240). It is curiositas that compels human beings to look at those things that make them shudder, the ultimate example of which is, according to Augustine, the mutilated corpse: This is something [in terms of sensual pleasure] they do not want to see even in dreams, or if forced to look at it while awake, or if lured to the sight expecting something pretty.. . . It is for this perverse craving that unnatural things are put on in the theater. This also leads men to pry into the arcane elements of nature, which are beyond our scope - knowing them would serve no purpose, yet men make of that knowing its own purpose. (245) Any act of looking that involves prying into things that are "beyond our scope" or "ken" raises the specter of the uncanny, a word that, according to Victoria Nelson, is etymologically rooted in "that which cannot be 'kenned' or known by the five senses" and that, by definition, is "beyond what is normal or expected" (17). In his essay "The Uncanny" (1919), Freud discusses the term's relevance for psychoanalysis, using as a primary example Hoffmann's story "The Sandman," in which, significantly, a man falls in love with a mechanical woman. Freud, however, dismisses the relevance of the android female in order to prove that the origin of uncanniness lies beyond what he calls "the pleasure principle." The fetishistic use of the uncanny android body by ASFRians raises questions about Freud's analysis that have relevance for the critical understanding of artificial bodies in popular culture both past and present. In order to pursue these questions, I draw analogies between the uncanny artificial bodies at the heart of ASFRian fantasy and those fetishized by the Surrealists, in particular the disarticulated dolls of German artist Hans Bellmer, as well as those within the current technosphere as exemplified by Mamoru Oshii's cyberpunk anime Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), which was deeply influenced by Bellmer' s work.</page><page sequence="6">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 409 Alt.sex.fetish.robots. The originary myth of the group A.S.F.R. is that it was started as a joke. The Usenet site, however, began to attract a loyal following of participants, primarily men, who had a secret attraction to the mechanical and the robotic. Many of them had believed that they were alone in their sexual preferences, and the site provided a sense of relief and community, a place to share their interests and compare notes with others, as well as a definitive name for the ill-defined feelings that they had been harboring in isolation. Although the acronym privileges robots, A.S.F.R. is, in fact, a blanket designation for a range of different fetishes, which includes sexual attraction to mannequins, dolls, and sculpture, as well as to real people acting like mannequins, puppets, dolls, or robots, being hypnotized, turned into statues, or immobilized or frozen in a variety of ways. While all of these fetishes were explored on the original newsgroup, many of their fans later splintered off and founded websites geared to their specific interests. They do, however, still consider themselves to be "ASFRian" and acknowledge their point of common interest: the thematic of programmatic control - whether imagined as hypnotism, magic, a puppet-master, or artificial intelligence - of a human object. When taken in this sense alone, A.S.F.R. strikes the imagination as a technological elaboration of standard BDSM (bondage-domination-sado-masochism) fantasies, in which one person dominates another for sexual pleasure. ASFRians are, in fact, sensitive to (and some might even agree with) this interpretation of their fetish, as well as the perception that it represents the reification of normative gender ideals (for when many first hear about the fetish - myself included - they imagine that, for ASFRians, desire is contingent on replacing a human subject with a vacant Stepford Wife or Husband, who mindlessly fulfills the orders of its master, both sexual and domestic). Indeed, it is this common assumption about their fetish that, according to ASFRians, necessitates its obscurity and keeps its members highly closeted in comparison to fetishists like the Furries and the Plushies (those who eroticize anthropomorphic and stuffed animals and animal costumes, respectively), who hold dozens of public conventions each year throughout the world. ASFRians are so concerned about the accusation of sadism or misogyny that they have coined a mantra or tagline, oft repeated on their websites: "ASFR is not about the objectification of women, it's about the feminization of objects."3 Aside from raising obvious questions about the extent to which the feminization of objects can be extricated from the objectification of women, the mantra does not so much clarify the fetish as strategically redirect it from the living to the nonliving. In so doing, it raises the specter of necrophilia, which is the lens through which the sexualization of artificial humans has been viewed since the establishment of sexology as a field of study, when "sexual pathologies" were first documented and catalogued. Although mention is made in Krafft- Ebing's landmark Psychopathia Sexualis (1886) of a "paraphilia" involving statues, including a reported incident of a gardener attempting to fornicate with a replica of the Venus de Milo (525), Iwan Bloch explores the preference for the artificial at greater length in The Sexual Life of Our Time In Its Relation to Modem Civilization (1928). In a chapter dedicated to sexual perversity, he highlights two variations of necrophilia, the first being "Venus Statuaria," the</page><page sequence="7">410 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) desire to have sexual intercourse with statues or other representations of human beings, a passion that he states can seize some merely by walking through a museum. The second, "Pygmalionism," is the desire to enact the animation of an inanimate statue, usually by having real women stand atop pedestals pretending to be statues and then gradually come to life. Such a request was, Bloch suggests, common in Parisian brothels at the turn of the century.4 Connected to the desire for statues is, according to Bloch, the use of new technologies to construct anatomically-correct human models for explicitly sexual ends: There exist true Vaucansons in this province of pornographic technology, clever mechanics who, from rubber and other plastic materials, prepare entire male or female bodies, which, as hommes or dames de voyage, subserve fornicatory purposes. More especially are the genital organs represented in a manner true to nature. Even the secretion of Bartholin's glands is imitated, by means of a "pneumatic tube" filled with oil. Similarly, by means of fluid and suitable apparatus, the ejaculation of the semen is imitated. Such artificial human beings are actually offered for sale in the catalogue of certain manufacturers of "Parisian rubber articles." (648) While in the case of "Venus Statuaria" Bloch makes a distinction between those who become sexually aroused by statues because they are artificial and those merely responding to a naked human body despite its artificiality (the latter of whom he suggests comprise the bulk of the documented cases), in general he tends to collapse distinctions between the various desires that circulate around the inanimate and to suggest that they are all equally perverse. Moreover, he treats such tendencies as a separate topic from fetishism, a category that he reserves for those who invest sexual energy in a part of the human body at the expense of the whole.5 Writing in the 1970s, A. Scobie and AJ.W. Taylor draw a greater distinction between "agalmatophilia" or the love of statues and Pygmalionism, the desire to bring a statue to life (49), while Murray White, whose article appeared three years after their study, dismisses agalmatophilia entirely, stating that a negligible number of cases has been cited over the course of two thousand years, none of which are verifiable. Moreover, he attributes the interest in the phenomenon to the "insatiable preoccupation with deviant nosology" of sexologists in the late- nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries (248), many of whom, in their own fetishistic zeal, failed to make the distinction between fantasy and reality: Agalmatophilia has been sparingly treated as a pornographic fantasy, but there is very little evidence supporting its status as a behavioral perversion. Early scientific researchers of sexual behavior appear to have sometimes confused fantasy (the process of imagining objects or events in terms of imagery) with perversion (sexual behavior which differs widely from normal standards and which is typically prohibited by law). (249) The constellation of artificial love schematized by Bloch has, however, been revived by Patricia Pulham, who suggests that the current popularity of life-sized silicone lovedolls, such as the Realdoll, indicates that with the help of new technologies, "agalmatophiliacs are alive and well, even if their objects of desire seem somewhat dead" (13).6 Drawing on Meghan Laslocky's interviews with</page><page sequence="8">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 41 1 Realdoll owners documented in her 2005 Salon, com article "Just Like a Woman," Pulham compares the lovers of silicone dolls with both Pygmalion and Lord Ewald in Villiers de l'Isle Adam's Tomorrow's Eve, and she suggests that while some men attempt to enliven their dolls through a variety of techniques, including heating the silicone skin before engaging in physical contact, the resonances between their desires and necrophilia are "difficult to ignore" (14).7 Her views are, in fact, echoed in the first film to use a Realdoll as a character, Love Object (2003). A horror film that was, according to writer-director Robert Parigi, inspired by the visual similarity between Realdolls and the dead bodies that he had witnessed on a visit to the morgue, Love Object centers on a shy office worker who has a silicone lovedoll made in the image of a female coworker (named Lisa Bellmer, a reference to the dolls of Hans Bellmer, discussed below) on whom he has a crush.8 At first it appears that the doll will serve as a successful transitional object to real women (a role that a Realdoll will later fulfill in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl); as he wines, dines, and otherwise engages his doll in a typical courting ritual, he gains an experiential confidence that enables him to relax around and ultimately start dating the woman on whom she has been modeled. The film suggests, however, that whatever pathology enabled him to invest life in a dead thing has a life of its own that requires an empty vessel for its fulfillment; and, since he disposed of the doll after he started to date the woman, he attempts to de-animate the woman through plastination in the story's horrifying climax.9 While there are clearly areas of overlap in the various desires around artificial bodies, the ongoing development of technologies for meeting such desires, as well as for the anonymous sharing of preferences within networked communities (the specificities of which tend to evolve in relation to one another), has made it somewhat easier to chart their distinctions. My own interviews with the buyers of life-sized silicone lovedolls and with ASFRians, and perusal of their respective websites, have led me to believe that, in general, they are two distinct groups.10 Moreover, while "death" in general, and the "death drive" in particular, are of relevance to their proclivities (as I will discuss below), necrophilia is too reductive and misleading a term for understanding the broad spectrum of behavior associated with either.11 Considering ASFRians in and of themselves, it is somewhat difficult to generalize (other than the fact that, with a small number of exceptions, they are predominantly male). As one member of the message board Fembot Central wrote in answer to one of my queries: the characteristics that any one of us "fetishizes" is always different - and often to a large degree - from anyone else' s . But also, the psychological undertones and the way we integrate this into our lives is entirely individual. The common ground is pretty small. In the broadest sense, I suspect that each of us here can agree with the broad definition, "I am attracted to things that look like people but aren't." And that each of us will further want to qualify that assertion in some way that we feel is important, (online communication, 17 June 2009)12 Although meaning does vary from one individual to another, the group makes a distinction between two (somewhat oppositional) tendencies, the first indicating the desire for a robot that is entirely artificial ("built") and the second devoted to</page><page sequence="9">412 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) the metamorphosis between the human and the robotic ("transformation"). Nevertheless, there are certain kinds of images and erotic practices that appeal to both groups and that appear repeatedly in relation to the fetish. For example, scenarios in which a real person is acting the part of a robot would likely be of interest to both groups, albeit for different reasons. Indeed, the majority of the ASFRians that I interviewed described their earliest fetishistic experiences as occurring while watching actors and actresses playing robots on such sf television shows as The Twilight Zone (1959-64), Outer Limits (1963-65), and Star Trek (1966-69). Moreover, the primary indicators of mechanicity on such shows, which include silver and gold costuming and mechanical behavioral mannerisms like robotic speech, stilted movement, and repetitive motion, often enacted within moments of transition (such as when a robot is booted up, shut down, or programmed) are equally exciting to both groups. A large part of ASFRian activity revolves around the recreation in private of both the costuming and performances of these actor robots, giving the fetish a kind of do-it-yourself quality on which Katherine Gates comments in her book Deviant Desires. Gates places A.S.F.R. alongside slash fandom as a group that appropriates sf effects in homemade productions to their own erotic ends; ASFRians often write their own stories, create their own pictures, and construct their own robot costumes using shiny materials like latex, PVC, and Lycra to which they attach toys that "blink, bobble, and glow" in order to create the illusion of circuitry (229). The emphasis on mechanicity complicates the relationship between ASFRian fantasy and the reality of artificial companions that achieve human verisimilitude; in fact, the state of tension and liminality - whether between the robotic and human or between control and loss of control, appearance and interior, motion and stasis - seems to have greater relevance to the fetish than the robot per se. As Gates notes, unmasking is a key aspect of the fetish, and many of the most exciting fantasies involve the sudden revelation of artificiality either through robotic malfunction (in which a human/robot gets caught in a repeat loop) or disassembly (in which a panel opens or a part is removed to reveal the circuitry beneath the semblance of humanity). While the latter is difficult to perform, ASFRians either search television and film for such moments (which they then list obsessively on their websites) or they produce disassembly images themselves in the manner of ASFRian artist Kishin, who either renders them from scratch in a 3D program or adds exposed circuitry to figures from erotic magazines using Photoshop, a practice that some call "rasterbation" (see figure 2). When I asked Kishin what it was about such imagery that he most enjoyed, he replied, "It's something about the contrast between the cold hard steel and the circuits and the wiring and the smooth skin and the soft flesh." The "come shot" for Kishin occurs when a female robot reaches up "to remove the mask that is her face" because "it's like a revelation of who she really is" (personal communication, 24 July 2001). But Who is She Really? In his essay "Fetishism" (1927), Freud tells us that in all cases a fetish is "a substitute for the woman's (mother's) phallus, which the little boy once believed in and does not wish to forego" (205-206). It embodies</page><page sequence="10">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 413 an ambivalence, a double attitude towards female castration for which a compromise is struck by which the absent phallus is conjured elsewhere, a new point of erotic fixation that serves as both an acknowledgement and denial, "a sort of permanent memorial" that may manifest itself in a single part, like a foot, which the fetishist then worships, or a set of opposing attitudes that involve both hostility and reverence, such as "the Chinese custom of first mutilating a woman' s foot and then revering it" (209). Figure 2: Kishin: "Who She Really Is" The ASFRian fetish object is, however, less a "permanent memorial" than a vacillating sign; it is, to use Freud's analogy, like mutilating one foot while keeping the other whole, an ongoing reminder that a deformation has occurred. To the extent that it attempts to assuage the ambivalence around an absence via a displaced presence, it also repetitively restages the exchange between presence and absence at this alternate location, re-enacting the trauma by which it was, theoretically, constituted. In this sense, it smacks of the compulsion to repeat that Freud links to the "death instinct." Indeed, there is a distinct similarity between the hiding and revealing of the mechanical interior of the robot female in ASFRian fantasy and the compulsive throwing away and retrieving of the wooden reel by the child in the game fort/da, described by Freud in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (13-14).13 There is, moreover, a correspondence between repetition compulsion and what is being revealed - the "who she really is" of ASFRian fantasy - that is bound up less in technology per se than in automatism, the revelation of a force (imagined as programming by ASFRians) beyond the rational mind or conscious will that controls behavior, and that is brought to the fore in moments of robotic unveiling or breakdown. Gates argues that the automatism at the heart of the fetish is a metaphor for sexuality itself: "the sense that we have no control over it; that we respond mechanically to stimuli; and that</page><page sequence="11">414 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) our sexual programming makes us helpless. Fetishes, especially, are a kind of hard- wired sexual subroutine" (228). In this sense, the erotics of automatism, as embraced by A.S.F.R., is a fetish whose object is, in part, a revelation of the compulsive mechanism of fetishism itself. Read more generally, however, A.S.F.R. not only points to the slippage between the subject and object of fetishism, but also to the ways in which the circuit between them is wired with both biological and cultural contact points, the exposure of which is potentially denaturalizing (for the object) and self-revelatory (for the subject). For example, while many ASFRians are fascinated by the film The Stepford Wives (1975; remade 2004), for many its primary interest resides less in the idea of the perfect housewife than in those scenes in which the Wives break down or become caught in a repeat loop - scenes beneath which foreboding music plays and that are intended to evoke horror. These are moments of vertiginous rupture that offer a glimpse of the robotic programming beneath the ideal exterior of the Wives and that also throw into relief the cultural norms through which such ideals are constructed. Indeed, in the film, such scenes serve as feminist commentary on the extent to which real women (and men) have been socially programmed. A connection is also made in the original film between the domestic scripting of women and television advertising; many of the Stepford Wives speak as though they are actresses in commercials for household products. It is, perhaps, of no small significance that ASFRians get particular pleasure out of those scenes in which normative gender roles, as shaped by media imagery and embodied by the female android, are short-circuited. Most of the ASFRians whom I interviewed came of age in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and while their fetish is a product of sf television shows, it is also a reaction to a historical and cultural moment in which mass consciousness was shaped by the centralizing force of media programming and advertising. Indeed, if the media in general, and television in particular, tend to codify normative social rules and behaviors, then science fiction stands out as a site where the normal rules are suspended and other worlds are imagined that, in many cases, serve as a critique of and an alternative to the conventions of our own world. Although one might apply the stereotype of the sf geek to many ASFRians, the shared attributes that stood out in the men I interviewed were a high degree of sensitivity and self-consciousness coupled with social awkwardness and difficulty reading social cues.14 Puberty was, for these men, an unusually fraught time during which they felt both confused by and compelled to conform to the rules of social engagement and political correctness. Interestingly, many of the ASFRians I interviewed considered themselves to be feminists - after all, many had come of age at the height of second-wave feminism - but they expressed confusion about how to reconcile the way they were raised - i.e., "to respect women" - with their sexual impulses. The female robot is, to some extent, a way out of the quandary: she represents the promise of a simplified playing field in which the rules of the game are programmed in advance, thus sidestepping gender politics and eliminating the anxiety of making social mistakes. Within that simplified playing field, however, ASFRians imagine endless concatenations of possible moves, the erotic loci of which are moments of tension and rupture between opposite states - the human</page><page sequence="12">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 415 and the artificial, control and loss of control, exterior and interior. Such rupture is, I would argue, both a metaphor for and a condensation of the eruptive effects of adolescent desire on the socially-regulated body; it is a re-enactment of the tension between biological and social programming, between the chaotic flux of inner experience and the unified and controlled self as mandated by the social order. Moreover, to the extent that it is an attempt at their reconciliation, it is through recourse to a third category, which has the potential to destabilize such dualisms as self and other, subject and object, and even male and female. Technology, in this sense, signals both the desire for and identification with an Other, a slippage made particularly apparent in one of the media examples cited most often as relevant to the fetish, an episode from the first season of The Twilight Zone entitled "The Lonely" (1959). The story takes place in the year 2046 on a barren and desolate asteroid nine million miles from earth, which serves as solitary confinement for a convicted criminal named James A. Corry. When the episode opens, a supply ship, which makes occasional visits to the planet, is arriving, and the captain, who has taken pity on the isolated prisoner, has left behind a box that he instructs Corry not to open until after the ship has departed. When Corry does open it, he finds a lifelike female android named Alicia, programmed to keep him company. While at first he wants nothing to do with her, his need for companionship prevails and he starts to forget her mechanical nature and eventually falls in love with her. The next time the supply ship arrives, the captain informs Corry that he has been pardoned and can return home immediately. As the prisoner rushes excitedly towards the ship with his companion, however, the captain informs him that there is not enough room for the android. Corry argues with him, insisting that Alicia is not an android but a woman, his woman, but the captain stands firm and, in order to wake Corry up to reality, pulls out his gun and shoots Alicia in the face. In the final scene, the female android breaks down; her calls for Corry get slower and s-1-o-w-e-r as broken circuitry and loose wiring shoot off a few last sparks of life through the hole where her face had been (see figure 3). Figure 3: Twilight Zone, "The Lonely" (1959)</page><page sequence="13">416 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) The narrative climax of "The Lonely" corresponds with the primary visual triggers of ASFRian desire - breakdown, disassembly, and unmasking. The android's exposed inner workings are, however, not so much a revelation as a re- membering; Corry already knew that Alicia was a robot, and thus what lies behind her faceplate is integrally connected to the mechanism inside him that made him forget or, to put it in terms of the fetishistic relationship, that sustained his belief that she was a woman despite the knowledge that she was a robot. This visual reminder of his own psychic split is what Lacan calls the objet petit a or the agalma (by which he means a hidden yet alluring object that animates desire, but which is, notably, the Greek word for statue and the root of agalmatophilia), Lacan associates the objet petit a with the game fort/da, claiming that the spool on the string can best be understood not as a little mother, but as "a small part of the subject that detaches itself from him while still remaining his, still retained" {Four 62). Freud associates the return of the once familiar forgotten with the uncanny, an aesthetic term on which he elaborates psychoanalytically in reference to Hoffman's story "The Sandman," whose climactic scene - in which the eyes of the mechanical woman, Olympia, are removed and she is revealed as an automaton - bears a distinct resemblance to the climax of "The Lonely." The uncanny is in this way a term and an experience of particular relevance to the "who she really is" of ASFRian fantasy. The Uncanny Gynoid. Freud uses as a starting point for his psychoanalytical inquiry into the uncanny a study entitled "The Psychology of the Uncanny" by physician Ernst Anton Jentsch, published in 1906. For Jentsch, the uncanny is a function of misoneism (the fear of the new), in which the mind becomes disoriented in relation to a phenomenon that does not conform to one's established conceptual framework or "ideational sphere" (8). It is Jentsch who initially links the uncanny to the German word unheimlich, the opposite of that with which one is familiar, the "heimlich" (homely) or heimisch (native) in German, and who uses Hoffmann's story as a significant example of the uncanny since: Among all the psychical uncertainties that can become an original cause of the uncanny feeling, there is one in particular that is able to develop a fairly regular, powerful and very general effect: namely, doubt as to whether an apparently living being is animate and, conversely, doubt as to whether a lifeless object may not in fact be animate. (Jentsch 11) Freud picks up where Jentsch leaves off but differs from Jentsch in his interpretation of the source of the uncanny. While for Jentsch the uncanny is rooted in uncertainty about something unknown, Freud insists that what makes this unknown thing frightening is the fact that it was once known, but has returned in an alienated form. While there is no more Unheimlich place than the female genitals - that "entrance to the former Heim of all human beings, to the place where everyone dwelt once upon a time in the beginning" (245) - this interpretation, interestingly, leads Freud away from the figure of the female automaton in Hoffmann' s story and the emphasis placed on her in Jentsch' s essay. According to Freud, the mystery surrounding Olympia is of less significance to</page><page sequence="14">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 417 the story's ability to elicit an uncanny sensation than the theme of the "Sandman," a mythological figure who steals the eyes of bad children while they are sleeping, and whose image haunts the protagonist, Nathanael, throughout the story. Uncanniness is based in the anxiety of losing one's sight, which is a substitute for the fear of castration and steeped in Oedipal drama. As Freud points out, Nathanael's anxiety about the Sandman (and losing his eyes) is intimately connected in the story with his father's death (his father dies mysteriously in the company of the frightening lawyer Coppelius, whom Nathanael associates with the Sandman). Moreover, there is a reoccurrence and doubling of characters; Nathanael's father is replaced by Spalanzani, the "father" of Olympia; the Sandman is Coppelius, who is also Coppola, the peddler who sells Nathanael the spyglass or "pocket perspective" through which he first sees Olympia. These doublings are linked to a theme of eyes: Coppola, whose name translates to coppo or "eye socket" in Italian, also made the eyes of Olympia, which he later steals back. All connect back, in a logically circular way, to Freud' s overall premise that the uncanny effects of similar occurrences are related to repressed infantile sexuality. Freud' s marginalization of Olympia has been a point of great contestation, and many have argued that Olympia represents the repressed within Freud's theory of the uncanny. As Nicholas Royle puts it: Freud's reading of "The Sandman" is a violent attempt to reduce or eliminate the significance of Jentsch's work on the Uncanny, and in particular the importance of the figures of the doll and automaton for an understanding of the uncanny. It is also a violent attempt to reduce or eliminate the place and importance of women.... Freud failed to see that the question of woman is inextricably connected to Nathaniel's fear of castration. (4 1)15 An intentionality begins to take shape, however, when we consider that Freud is drawing our attention away from the visual ambiguity of Olympia' s physicality towards the psychic register of the story's (imaginary) Sandman. Freud, in a sense, replaces vision with the symbolism of eyes, in this way moving within the etiology of hysteria, an illness that serves as the backdrop of Olympia' s behavior and Nathanael's madness. Our first clue to the importance of hysteria in Freud's reading of the uncanny is his rationale for dismissing Olympia as a symbol of infantile sexuality. While Freud acknowledges that Olympia does evoke a sense of the uncanny, he suggests that it arises not from the return of the repressed, but from the return of the surmounted. The return of the repressed involves the revival of infantile complexes, or amputated aspects of oneself, which had been buried in the unconscious. The return of the surmounted involves discarded beliefs that are "primitive" or "animistic" in nature. When something happens that we cannot explain - for example, a coincidence of events, the manifestation of secret desires or thoughts, the animation of an inanimate body - it revives and brings into expression these old beliefs, raising doubts about our current material reality and creating a sense of the uncanny. Accordingly, the return of the surmounted tends to operate in the realm of reality more than fiction, where supernatural events are less unusual.</page><page sequence="15">418 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) Olympia is, of course, fictional, but to the extent that her mechanical behavior strikes a supernatural chord, it evokes the real uncanniness of the hysterical body, whose paroxysmal and repetitive gestures seem animated by unseen forces. Jentsch draws an explicit association between the two, suggesting that while the automaton strikes some people more than others as uncanny, the uncanniness of a mental and nervous illness, such as epilepsy or hysteria, is nearly universal, since it renders the autonomous human subject mechanical or puppet-like: It is not unjustly that epilepsy is therefore spoken of as the morbus sacer, as an illness deriving not from the human world but from foreign and enigmatic spheres, for the epileptic attack of spasms reveals the human body to the viewer - the body under normal conditions is so meaningful, expedient, and unitary, functioning according to the direction of his consciousness - as an immensely complicated and delicate mechanism. This is an important cause of the epileptic fit's ability to produce such a demonic effect on those who see it. (14) It is because of its mechanical seizures, paradigmatically associated with grotesque body movements - such as spasms, convulsions, and catalepsy - that hysteria inspired varying interpretations about its animating force over the course of its history, reaching a low point in the late fifteenth century with the publication of the handbook for witch-hunters and Inquisitors, Malleus Maleficarum (1487), in which it was interpreted as a form of Satanic possession. Although the etiology of hysteria began to shift with the birth of modern medicine, the man who freed it, once and for all, from its association with animisi superstition was the famous neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot ( 1 825- 1 893), whose theatrical displays of hysteria at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris in the late nineteenth century became legendary and with whom Freud studied between 1 885 and 1886.16 There is, in fact, a significant parallel between Freud's redirection of our attention from the mechanical body of the female automaton in "The Sandman" and his shift in emphasis from the external symptoms of hysteria charted by Charcot to an exploration of internal psychic processes, a shift that directly paved the way for his development of psychoanalysis. Charcot is, perhaps, most remembered as the man who not only tamed hysteria but also theatricalized it, transforming a cacophony of symptomatic gestures into a choreographed ballet whose movements could be anticipated and, as was often the case, provoked. His legacy includes both the unprecedented photographic document of hysterical symptoms, Iconographie photographique de la Salp√™tri√®re (1876-77, 1878, 1879-80), and the famous Tuesday lessons in which he hypnotized patients, who then dutifully performed their symptoms before an audience of "literary men, artists, art critics, actors and politicians" (Schade 505). If, in fact, fetishism is grounded in condensing and fixing that which causes anxiety in a form that can be performed repeatedly for visual pleasure, then Charcot could be called hysteria's pornographer. As Freud would later state in his obituary for Charcot: He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: he had the nature of an artist - he was, as he himself said, a visuel, a man who sees. Here is what he himself told us about his method for working. He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an</page><page sequence="16">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 419 understanding of them dawned on him. In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then gave way to order.... He called this kind of intellectual work, in which he had no equal, "practicing nosography," and he took pride in it. He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new. (qtd in de Marnaffe 92; emphasis added)17 Charcot's nosography, dedicated as it was to an unflinching vision that saw "something new," an intelligible order, within the unknown and visually chaotic, poses an answer not only to the indecipherability of hysterical symptoms, but to the uncanny as misoneism (the fear of the new) through which they are rendered demonic. In domesticating and aestheticizing the unassimilable and frightening, Charcot produced the kind of theater through which the uncanny is rendered both pleasurable and cathartic; and this is precisely the role of the fictional uncanny, according to Ernst Jentsch, of which Hoffmann was a master: In life we do not like to expose ourselves to severe emotional blows, but in the theatre or while reading we gladly let ourselves be influenced in this way: we hereby experience certain powerful excitements which awake in us a strong feeling for life, without having to accept the consequences of the causes of the unpleasant moods if they were to have the opportunity to appear in corresponding form on their own account, so to speak. In physiological terms, the sensation of such excitements seems frequently to be bound up with artistic pleasure in a direct way. (12) The theatrical framing of the uncanny, through which the spectator experiences dissimulation as pleasure, is related to the fetishistic pleasure that Nathanael experiences in his encounter with the female automaton, whose embodiment of both the human and artificial, the living and dead, strikes profound chords within him. In a similar manner to ASFRians, Nathanael is erotically drawn to those qualities in Olympia that others find inhuman: her stiff and measured gait and mechanical movements appear to him as ciphers of hidden meaning; her repetitive and vacuous utterances strike him as "genuine hieroglyphs of the inner world of Love and of the higher cognition of the intellectual life revealed in the intuition of the Eternal beyond the grave" (Hoffmann 207-208). Unlike ASFRians, however, he is driven mad by the revelation, at the end of the story, of the subjectivity that he has invested in the object of his love, a revelation that leads to his suicide. It is this madness, which Jentsch celebrates in Hoffmann's work, that Freud is interested in extracting from the visual and the aesthetic in his theorization of the uncanny. Freud is, in a sense, attempting to isolate that which leads to Nathanael' s death rather than the mediated experience of death enjoyed by the viewer (or reader). Moreover, Freud's insistence that we ignore the automaton in our attempt to understand the causes of the uncanny is, I would suggest, related to the extent to which Charcot's visual approach to hysteria occluded the real causes of the ailment. Although Charcot was able to find meaning in visual disorder, he discounted that which was most meaningful - what his patients were saying - as delirious banter. Freud, however, subsequent to his studies with Charcot, began</page><page sequence="17">420 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) in his private practice to listen for the psychological content of what his patients were saying, ultimately concluding that their hysterical symptoms were the result of sexually-based trauma that was repressed, displaced from the lower body regions, and somatically converted into motor activity.18 And in lieu of hypnosis, which Charcot had so theatrically induced in his patients before a crowd of onlookers, he prescribed "the talking cure" through which access was gained to the analysand's "private theatre" only within the context of the psychoanalytic relationship.19 Aside from its larger implications in the development of the field of psychoanalysis, this core insight about the etiology of hysteria serves as the backdrop for Freud's interpretation of the uncanny as the return of repressed infantile sexuality and his insistence that we turn our attention away from the visual signs of Olympia' s ambiguous nature, suggestive of supernatural influences, towards the symbolic register of Nathanael's castration anxiety, enacted through a narrative doubling in the form of the Sandman. Unlike Jentsch, who is interested in the aesthetics of the uncanny and how something frightening in real life can be rendered pleasurable within art and literature, Freud is interested in linking the uncanny to a psychological drive that overrides the pursuit of pleasure. He will call this the "death instinct" in Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( 1 920), a book that served as the impetus for his essay "On the Uncanny" (1919) - the latter was written between drafts of the former and published the year before - as well as a reworking of his theory of the drives. Early in the book, he states that while the enjoyment derived from "painful experiences" in the theater or art hints at that which he is addressing, they "are of no use for our purposes, since they presuppose the existence and dominance of the pleasure principle; they give no evidence of the operation of tendencies beyond the pleasure principle, that is, of tendencies more primitive than it and independent of it" (17; emphases in original). In elaborating on the compulsion to repeat at the heart of the death drive, Freud once again passes over the mechanical body of hysteria and uses as an example the traumatic dreams of soldiers returned from battle (with whom he had direct experience following World War I). Freud concludes that the repetitive war dreams of the soldiers were attempts at preparing for and mastering retrospectively traumas that, at the time they were experienced, had caught them by surprise, or of developing after the fact the shielding "anxiety whose omission was the cause of the traumatic neurosis": "They thus afford us a view of a function of the mental apparatus which, though it does not contradict the pleasure principle, is nevertheless independent of it and seems to be more primitive than the purpose of gaining pleasure and avoiding unpleasure" (37). To extrapolate from this to Freud's interpretation of Hoffmann's story: the uncanny as a repetition compulsion that overrides the pleasure principle is better represented by the imaginary Sandman, who inspires revulsion and fear in Nathanael in every form in which he is repeated, than by Olympia, whose mechanical movements, however much they hint at the "death instinct" lurking beneath Eros, are marked by a vacillation between life and death, beauty and its</page><page sequence="18">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 421 shadow, that is experienced by Nathanael (and the reader) as both compelling and pleasurable. Mad Love. Freud's occlusion of the female body, as well as his denial of erotic pleasure, in relation to the "compulsion to repeat" is thrown into sharp relief in a strange anecdote in his essay "On the Uncanny" when he discusses an experience he had of unintentionally and repeatedly returning to the red-light district of a small Italian town that he was visiting, whose streets were unknown to him: I found myself in a quarter of whose character I could not long remain in doubt. Nothing but painted women were to be seen at the windows of the small houses, and I hastened to leave the narrow street at the next turning. But after having wandered about for a time without enquiring my way, I suddenly found myself back in the same street, where my presence was now beginning to excite attention. I hurried away once more, only to arrive by another d√©tour at the same place yet a third time. Now, however, a feeling overcame me which I can only describe as uncanny, and I was glad enough to find myself back at the piazza I had left a short while before.... (237) While Freud hints at the psychic origin of this "unintended reoccurrence of the same situation," he quickly moves on, ignoring the erotic significance of the "painted women" in the compulsion that repeatedly brought him back into their company. To the extent that the "painted lady" is repressed (both in this anecdote and in Freud's theorization of the uncanny) in order to stress the "death instinct" over the sexual drives, she will, however, return with a vengeance in the works of Surrealism, an artistic and cultural movement that came of age with psychoanalysis and that compulsively explored the link between Eros and Thanatos, often in the form of artificial women and imagery that invoked the disarticulations of hysteria. Indeed, Freud's experience in the Italian town was virtually recreated in 1938 at the height of the movement at the International Exposition of Surrealism held in Paris, which featured a network of dimly lit streets populated by mannequins, each outfitted by a different artist (with objects ranging from a bird cage to a fisherman's net), an uncanny red-light district through which visitors were initially asked to find their way in the dark with a flashlight (Belton 111). Although Freud attempted to close a Pandora's Box by diverting attention away from the mechanical body, whether automaton or hysteric, he opened another in his "discovery" of the automatic psychic processes behind the compulsion to repeat. Just as the body of the automaton/hysteric was losing her meaning - for she had been emptied of demonic intrigue by Charcot and visual intrigue by the practice of psychoanalysis - she was once again invested with an invisible force (the repressed unconscious), inspiring a generation of artists and writers to make her a site/sight of psychic and erotic exploration. Andr√© Breton, the founder of the Surrealist movement, famously called hysteria "the greatest poetic discovery of the nineteenth century" (Breton and Aragon 61), for in its manifestations of psychic automatism he saw not symptoms of pathology but liberation, a means of expressing an inner psychic reality that was superior to</page><page sequence="19">422 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) external reality. Breton was first exposed to hysteria and the techniques of dream interpretation and free association during World War I, as a medical student interning in a series of neuropsychiatrie clinics (under two former assistants of Charcot, Raoul Leroy and Joseph Babinski) that offered treatment to soldiers who had returned from battle. In the same symptoms of "post-traumatic stress" that had inspired Freud's theory of the death drive, Breton detected a psychic (sur)reality, and in those same techniques used to address the shock of war on the psyche and shepherd it back to normalcy, he intuited a system for shocking the mind out of its normative conditioning and tapping into its imaginative potential.20 While Breton's poetic interpretation and creative use of psychoanalytic theory put Surrealism at odds with Freud, as well as the French School of Psychiatry as represented by Pierre Janet, Breton credited Freud with bringing back to light "the most important aspect of intellectual life" ("Exquisite Corpse" 66) and grounded Surrealist practice in the "psychic automatism" of Janet.21 The "official" definition of Surrealism offered by Breton in 1924, in the movement's first manifesto, was as follows: SURREALISM, n. Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express - verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner - the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern. ("Manifesto" 26) The Surrealists experimented with psychic automatism through a variety of collaborative writing and drawing games whose goal was to bypass the mind and tap into the inner psyche, and the results of which were often nonsensical phrases or imagistic disarticulations that reproduced the illogic of dreams and the physical disjuncture of hysteria (viewed as analogues by the Surrealists). A favorite was called The Exquisite Corpse, played by a group of people on a piece of paper. The first person would compose part of a sentence or drawing, fold over the paper so that his contribution would be concealed from the next person, who would add onto it, until all were finished and the paper was unfolded. The resulting figures - disjointed hybrids that merged inanimate objects with parts of animals, as well as female and male body parts, conjoined or mutated beyond recognition - were extolled by Breton for their "total negation of the ridiculous activity of imitation of physical characteristics," as well as for carrying "anthropomorphism to its climax" ("Exquisite Corpse" 95). Reminiscent of the ASFRian "feminization of objects," the anthropomorphism enacted by the Exquisite Corpse was one of a series of Surrealist interests - including dolls, mannequins, and the conjunction of the human and the mechanical - that dovetail with ASFRian proclivities, to which Breton gave the name "convulsive beauty." At the end of Nadja (the last line of which is, "Beauty will be CONVULSIVE or will not be at all" [160]), Breton links convulsive beauty to the trauma of a railway accident - which (like war trauma) Freud discusses in relation to the compulsion to repeat in Beyond the Pleasure Principle - resulting in a jolt, shock, or "short circuit" that derails the rational mind. In L'Amour Fou (Mad Love, 1937), he elaborates on the concept (and the</page><page sequence="20">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 423 train analogy), suggesting that the perfect illustration would be "a photograph of a very handsome locomotive after it had been abandoned for many years to the delirium of a virgin forest," for "there can be beauty - convulsive beauty - only at the price of the affirmation of the reciprocal relationship that joins an object in movement to the same object in repose" ("Mad Love" 162.) Breton's erotic and liberatory interpretation of the trauma associated with the railroad thus offers an alternative reading of the machine woman of modernism about which Huyssen writes. The artist who took the disarticulated figure of convulsive beauty even further than the Surrealists, who was perhaps most responsible for the Surrealist fascination with mannequins, and whose work intersects most blatantly with ASFRian proclivities, is the German artist Hans Bellmer (1902-1975), best known for his photographed poup√©es or dolls.22 Bellmer drew an explicit connection between his dolls and the uncanny, stating that a large part of their inspiration was his attendance at Max Reinhardt' s 1 932 production of the Offenbach opera "Tales of Hoffmann," in which the story of Coppelia/Olympia from the "The Sandman" is recreated in the first act. He began work on his first doll shortly thereafter, building its frame from wood brooms and metal rods jointed with nuts and bolts Figure 4: Bellmer' s work in Minotaur e 6 (Winter 1934-35) and filled out with flax fiber covered with plaster of pans. Throughout the doll's construction, he took photographs, ten of which were included in a small book that he published with his own money called Die Puppe (The Doll, 1934), preceded by a short introductory text entitled "Memories of a Doll Theme." In the winter of 1934-35, eighteen photographs appeared in a two-page spread in the Surrealist journal Minotaure under the title "Variations sur le montage d'un mineure articul√©e," launching his relationship with the surrealist movement (see figure 4). In the images from the book and journal, the doll appears like a mannequin- wannabe caught in an ongoing state of arrested development between</page><page sequence="21">424 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) wholeness and dissolution, adulthood and adolescence, her sad, partial figure splayed on a bed or leaning against a wall and often posed against a backdrop of chiffon or delicate lace. Bellmer had wanted to allude to the internal or psychic nature of the doll's form through a kind of peep show embedded in her stomach. Activated by a button on the left nipple, it was to display in succession six miniature panoramas attached to a wooden disc, each of which made visible "suppressed girlish thoughts" (qtd. in Lichtenstein 174). Although the peep-show was never implemented, Bellmer' s desire to produce a figure capable of articulating an inner psychic reality was more fully realized through a second doll, completed in 1935. Inspiration came in the form of a pair of sixteenth-century wooden figures, each about eight inches tall, that he and Lotte Pritzel discovered in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin.23 Used by artists as aids to study human proportions and movement (similar to the wooden figures that artists still use today), they could be manipulated to a high degree, since every body part, from limbs to neck and torso, was assembled around carefully crafted ball joints. Using them as a guide, Bellmer produced wooden ball joints around which he arranged a new set of interchangeable and multiplied limbs and breasts. Unlike the first doll, the second was less a construction than what Rosalind Krauss has called "construction as dismemberment" (86; emphasis in original), an endlessly transformable configuration of discombobulated body parts, which Bellmer photographed in more naturalistic settings. Some of the more provocative images involve two sets of legs attached to the same torso, from which the upper body and head are missing. The uncanny doubling of limbs that are often contorted or flailing conveys both the disarticulation and the convulsive visuality of hysteria, by which Bellmer, like many Surrealists, was fascinated. Bellmer elaborates on the connection between these dolls and hysteria in his Little Anatomy of the Physical Unconscious, or The Anatomy of the Image (1957), which serves as a theoretical and poetic counterpart to his work. The book translates the Freudian interpretation of hysteria as the physical migration of displaced psychic trauma into a theory of desire, particularly as expressed and transformed through the kinds of physical distortions made possible by the image. In a lengthy passage worth quoting for the way in which it eroticizes the shock associated with the uncanny, Bellmer suggests that desire takes its point of departure, when concerning the intensity of its images, not from a perceptive whole but from details. If a naked hand unexpectedly emerges from a pair of pants in place of a foot, it is provocative of quite another degree of reality and - like an embarrassing stain on the edge of one's underwear - infinitely more powerful than an entirely visible woman; it hardly matters, for the moment, whether this efficacy can be attributed to the surprise of discovering a deceptive aspect of desire, anticipated souvenirs, or even some reference to dark knowledge. The main thing to retain from the monstrous dictionary of analogies/antagonisms, which constitute the dictionary of the image, is that any given detail, such as a leg, is perceptible, accessible to memory, and available (in short is REAL), only if desire does not fatally take it for a leg. The object identical to itself remains devoid of reality. (31; emphasis added)</page><page sequence="22">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 425 The conception expressed by Bellmer of a "REAL" that is invoked by a surprising and embarrassing "stain" in the field of vision would be rearticulated as the Gaze by Jacques Lacan in his 1964 Seminar, in which he applies to psychoanalysis the insights of, among other surrealists, Breton in Mad Love. Lacan makes a critical distinction between the eye of conscious perception and the Gaze that lies outside of consciousness, the former associated with what he calls the automaton ("the insistence of signs, by which we see ourselves governed by the pleasure principle") and the latter the tuch√© (the "encounter with the real," repeated "as if by chance," which lies beyond the automaton [Four 53-54]). While these terms, which Lacan deploys in order to articulate "the function of the real in repetition" (54), are elaborations of that which lies within and beyond the pleasure principle, unlike Freud, who steers us away from representational practices, Lacan is interested in tracing the tuch√© or Gaze within the visual field, which he, like Bellmer, aligns with "the stain": "The function of the stain and of the gaze is both that which governs the gaze most secretly and that which always escapes from the grasp of that form of vision that is satisfied with itself in imagining itself as consciousness" {Four 74). The "stain" is thus that which visually undermines the automaton or Ideal-/ constituted through what Lacan calls the "mirror stage," a psychic turning point when the infant, who has yet to gain full mastery of its body, identifies its "self within a mirror for the first time. The exteriorized double, through which the infant appears whole, integrated, and individual, will become the misplaced site of "self '-identification, whose Gestalt opposes the heterogeneous flux of the body, launching the /'s mental permanence, at the same time as it prefigures its alienating destination. This gestalt is also replete with the correspondences that unite the / with the statue onto which man projects himself, the phantoms that dominate him, and the automaton with which the world of his own making tends to achieve fruition in an ambiguous relation. ("Mirror" 5) Bellmer' s dolls reverse the process by which the automaton of the "mirror stage" is constructed by disturbing the image with surprising "details," as well as through an uncanny doubling that invokes the "fragmented body" - retained after the "mirror phase," according to Lacan, in dreams and "the lines of 'fragilization' that define the hysteric's phantasmatic anatomy, which is manifested in schizoid and spasmodic symptoms" (6-7). This gesture of derealization is exemplified by one of Bellmer' s photographs (see figure 5) in which the ball-jointed doll, appearing as two sets of legs inversed and attached to the same torso, each outfitted like a young girl in Mary Janes and bobby socks, lies sprawled in front of a mirror, one set of legs braced against the wall and mirror, the other seemingly in the midst of kicking as if in a temper tantrum or hysterical fit. Visible in the mirror against which the doll is leaning is an amorphous jumble of parts, which has no correspondence to the body it is reflecting. Played out within the conflicted doubling of the doll and its disjointed reflection is an attempt at acknowledging the split upon which the subject is constituted. Like the robotic interior that ruptures the human exterior within ASFRian fantasy, the mirrored or doubled image within Bellmerian anatomy does not serve as a reconstruction so much as an unmasking, a sign (experienced "as if by chance") of the Real that lies beyond</page><page sequence="23">426 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) Figure 5: "The Mirror Stage" the automaton. It is for this reason that, as Rosalind Krauss suggests, Bellmer's dolls complicate the Freudian model of fetishism, in which an artificial monument is erected in place of a natural absence: Surrealist photography does not admit of the natural, as opposed to the cultural or made. And so all of what it looks at is seen as if already, and always, constructed, through a strange transposition of this thing into a different register. We see the object by means of an act of displacement, defined through a gesture of substitution. The object, "straight" or manipulated, is always manipulated, and thus always appears as a fetish. (69) Hal Foster, on the other hand, suggests that Bellmer's dolls appeal to something more than fetishism and beyond the pleasure principle. As he notes, unlike the Freudian fetish object, they do not disguise sexual difference but explore it obsessively, and they do not hide the effects of their own production, as in the Marxist account of fetishism, but flaunt it repetitively. "Moreover, the notion of a 'dictionary of analogues-antagonisms' does not imply a fixing of desire (as in the Freudian account of fetishism); rather its shifting drives the many recombinations of the dolls" (103). Bellmer's attempt to map the convolutions of the psyche and the rhizomatic workings of desire, free from outside control, complicates any understanding of the dolls as autonomous. Nevertheless, like Surrealism itself, Bellmer has been subject to a great deal of criticism for his blatant and seemingly sadistic manipulation of the female figure.24 To such critiques, Foster responds that a distinction should be made between sadism and the representation of sadism: Bellmer's dolls "go beyond (or is it inside?) sadistic mastery to the point where the masculine subject confronts his greatest fear: his own fragmentation, disintegration, and dissolution. And yet this is also his greatest wish" (109). Moreover, both Foster and Th√©r√®se Lichenstein insist that Bellmer's dolls should</page><page sequence="24">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 427 be read through the sociopolitical context in which they were created. Bellmer's first doll was constructed in 1933, the year that the Nazis came to power in Germany. At the time, Bellmer owned an advertising and design agency. He closed down shop, however, fearful of inadvertently creating work that would in some way benefit the government, and devoted himself entirely to art that, according to Lichtenstein, was produced, in large part, as a protest against the cult of the perfect body within fascism, as well as the more general appearance of a mechanized, spectacularized, and "feminized" mass culture (13). Against these idealized and stereotyped bodies, Bellmer pits a convulsively mutating figure that breaches the boundaries of physical beauty and unity policed by the Nazis, while also embodying the psychological tensions and displacements experienced under the social constraints of fascism. Bellmer suggests in his Little Anatomy that, as in hysteria, the greater the repression, the more convoluted the expression, and thus the dolls not only represent the promiscuity or "flow" of desire, but also the psychic distortions of a desire caught between inner longing and external forces. As he says elsewhere, "The origin of that part of my work that scandalizes is the fact that for me the world is a scandal" (qtd. in Jelenski n.p.). There is, then, both self-reflexivity and social critique at work in Bellmer's dolls; indeed, he seems to pose an unflinching self-reflexivity as a form of social critique. In short, Bellmer's dolls were intended, as I have argued about ASFRian fantasy, as a desublimatory assault on the normative, stable, and cohesive subject, and in particular on the psychic armoring of the fascist body by which fragmentary, fluid, and chaotic drives were repressed, abjected, and mapped onto the Other, represented in the case of the Nazis by women, Jews, homosexuals, and Communists.25 They speak not to the aesthetic gaze, in which the sexual drives are sublimated through the object of beauty, but to the curious gaze of Pandora, who opens the box and experiences the uncanny vertigo of her own true nature (as does Nathanael when the automaton is revealed as not just a mechanical object, but an extension of the mechanical compulsions of his own psyche). Eye Robot. Although Bellmer's dolls were a product of their time, created in dialogue with the cult of the perfect body within fascism and the hysterical body within Surrealism, they anticipate the dislocation of bodies and identities, as well as the interpretive dilemmas they inspire, within current technocultural contexts. Indeed, the extent to which cyberbodies are, like those of hysteria, displaced (by prosthetic implants and extensions), dispersed (by communications technologies), and subject to forces outside the will of their owners, is one of the central concerns of cyberpunk. Moreover, like Bellmer's disarticulated dolls, when such technologically decentered figures cross into gendered and eroticized zones, they often inspire conflicting claims of containment and liberation, as well as conflicting reactions between alienation and desire. The connection between the two is made explicit in Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, which uses Bellmer's dolls as a central visual thematic to underscore the uncanniness of embodiment and desire when mediated through technology.</page><page sequence="25">428 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) The sequel to Ghost in the Shell (K√¥kaku kidotai, 1995) and similarly adapted from the manga by Masamune Shirow, Ghost in the Shell 2 explores at greater length not only the kinds of questions posed by the first film about mind, matter, and spirit in the information age, but also the aesthetic and ethical concerns raised by the encounter with artificial bodies. The second film, in fact, seems to address directly the critical reception of the first film, particularly concerning the central protagonist, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg. The first film takes place in the year 2029; Kusanagi is a special agent whose bodily parts are entirely artificial - except for her original brain tissue, which is encased within a titanium skull - and owned by her employer, the government security force Section Nine. Both cybernetically enhanced and contained, posthuman and sexualized, Kusanagi has inspired comparisons to Haraway' s cyborg in her embodiment of both "the liberating and the dehumanizing power of technology," as well as critiques of her seemingly ambivalent suspension "between a progressive and a reactionary politics of technology or gender" (Bolton 730). Carl Silvio, for example, casts her as a posthuman update of Pandora, suggesting a deceptive split between her appearance and reality; while she poses as a radical cyborg, she ultimately reinforces traditional gender roles, exhibiting a duplicity of which a great deal of cyborg culture is guilty: "There is thus what might be called an element of seduction at work, whereby information technology often presents itself to us as potentially liberating when in fact our actual interactions with it often reinforce conventional social structures of domination" (55). If Silvio's critique seems to echo those of Bellmer's dolls in its concern for the status of the culturally and physically situated female body in the face of its disarticulated counterparts, other critics have, in a manner similar to Bellmer's defenders, pointed out that such a critique ignores the distinction between representations of embodiment and actual bodies. Christopher Bolton, for example, draws from the long tradition of puppetry in Japan in order to illustrate the ways that artificial bodies (especially when represented within anime) are marked by an added layer of performativity that inflects their meaning, and he suggests that to ignore the performative aspect of these bodies is to miss their critical potential: Concerned with linking anime to a real-world context in which flesh-and-blood bodies are threatened with genuine objectif ication and violence, this approach treats fictional cyborgs on more or less the same plane as living human subjects. But treating Kusanagi as a living subject clearly misses the ways in which her body will always fall inside quotation marks; she is a virtual or performed subject that is both unreal and more than real from the start. (737) Bolton' s reminder of the puppet's artifice is a leitmotif in Ghost in the Shell 2, a film that explores the confusion between the human and the artificial, as well as the real and the virtual, in relation to a central question posed, significantly, by a character named and fashioned after Donna Haraway: "Why are humans so obsessed with recreating themselves?" In the film, the character Haraway is a coroner, who appears in a lab surrounded by android parts, including bodies hanging from hooks and a vat of artificial eyes. Although one might be tempted to compare her appearance to that of the real Donna Haraway, when the scene</page><page sequence="26">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 429 comes to a close, she lifts up a faceplate to reveal, behind her eyes, a technological viewing apparatus implanted in her skull. Echoing the scene in "The Sandman" when Olympia' s eyes are removed, it is one of many reminders in the film that we are in the zone of the visual uncanny, where the boundary between human and machine, as well as between perception and reality, is unstable. Indeed, Oshii has explicitly stated the importance of the concept of the uncanny for understanding his film, which displays, in particular, an "obsession with the uncanniness of ningy√µ (literally, 'human-shaped figures') in the form of dolls, puppets, automata, androids, and cyborgs" (Brown 222). Moreover, Ghost in the Shell 2, like Hoffmann's story, interrogates the uncanny in the realm of desire through the figure of the female android. The film opens three years after the close of the story in the first Ghost in the Shell. A prototype of a new gynoid model, the Hadaly 2052 (manufactured by the corporation Locus Solus specifically for sexual purposes), is running amok, and there have been a string of incidents in which Hadaly gynoids kill their owners and, shortly thereafter, self-destruct.26 The film follows the investigation by Section Nine, this time led by the cyborg Batou, the second in command under Kusanagi in the first film, and his "mostly-human" partner, Togusa. It opens with a chase scene in which Batou follows the trail of a Hadaly who has just killed her owner and two police officers. Batou corners the wayward gynoid in an alleyway and, just as he is about to shoot her, she cries "Help Me!" and proceeds to self- destruct, ripping open her own chest to expose her inner mechanism and then ejecting her metallic skull like a jack-in-the box (see figure 6). This scene is more than suggestive of the kind of unmasking central to both ASFRian and Bellmerian Figure 6: Exploding Gynoid in Ghost in the Shell 2 fantasy; as Steven Brown notes, it was inspired by an illustration by Bellmer entitled Rose ouverte la nuit (Rose opened at night, 1934), in which a young girl rips open her own skin to reveal her inner organs (see Brown 239). The reference to Bellmer becomes more explicit in the opening credits that follow, in which title cards are interspersed with a series of sequences depicting the manufacture of a Hadaly-type gynoid, whose ball-jointed limbs move into place within a watery environment, accompanied by the sound of clicking gears. As a pair of legs</page><page sequence="27">430 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) without a torso floats into view, it seems to undergo binary fission, doubling before our eyes into a nearly exact replica of Hans Bellmer's ball-jointed doll, before separating into two identical gynoids (see figure 7). The reference to Bellmer is reinforced yet again later in the film, when Batou finds a significant clue to the mystery of the malfunctioning gynoids in a representation of the Japanese reissue of Bellmer's book "The Doll" (published in 1995) that he discovers at a crime scene. An inspector has been murdered by yakuza affiliated Figure 7: Ball-jointed doll in GIS2 opening with Locus Solus. The clue, slipped into the pages of Bellmer's book, is a holographic image of a young girl, whom Batou will eventually discover to be only one of many children abducted by the yakuza for Locus Solus for the purpose of "ghost dubbing" - extracting their ghosts to ensoul the Hadaly gynoids and make them more desirable. The children's bodies are kept suspended within mechanical cocoons. This turn of events not only echoes the narrative of Villiers' s Tomorrow's Eve, in which the android Hadaly (the citational source for the Hadaly androids in the film) is ensouled by a living woman in a catatonic trance, it offers an inversion of the climactic scene within Hoffmann's tale: instead of the woman being revealed as an android, the android is unmasked to reveal the human beneath the mechanical exterior of the doll. Although the resolution to the murder mystery is conventional in the sense that the villains are stopped and the young girls are saved, the ethical landscape of the film is less clear. When the little girl from the holographic portrait is freed, she explains to Batou that the inspector was killed for overwriting the ethics code programmed into the gynoids, which prevented them from harming humans or themselves, the rationale being that if they malfunctioned violently, it would help to draw attention to the children's plight. "But what about the victims?" Batou asks, to which she reacts with a tearful outburst, "I didn't want to become a doll!" Kusanagi, whose ghost appears in the film only in this final scene in the form of one of the Bellmerian Hadaly bodies (which she has temporarily inhabited to help Batou), responds to the little girl's lament: "If the dolls could speak, no doubt they'd scream: I didn't want to become human." There is, so the film seems to</page><page sequence="28">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 43 1 suggest, an equal injustice committed in forcing humanity upon the doll (whether visually, narratively, or critically), as there is in making human girls doll-like. Indeed, the film not only "remediates Bellmer's dolls" (Brown 223), it also rearticulates his aesthetic conviction (quoted above) that "the object identical to itself remains devoid of reality." This point is emphasized through a variety of strategies, both narrative and formal, for defamiliarizing or rendering uncanny the characters in the drama in ways that remind us repeatedly that they are not who or what they appear to be. One strategy of defamiliarization, which Oshii borrows from French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, is citationality . The dialogue throughout the film is interspersed with quotations of other authors - meditations on the relationship between mind and body, as well as between dolls and humans, drawn from such diverse sources as Ren√© Descartes, Heinrich von Kleist, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, John Milton, and the Old Testament. This technique adds a critical dimension to the film by drawing attention to the history of ideas that informs its inquiry into the human and the artificial. In this way, the characters speak both for themselves and within a network of cultural and historical relations of which the viewer is made continually aware. Characters are also disrupted from within the diegesis through e-brain hacking. There are numerous instances in the film in which, as Brown puts it, "one character literally or metaphorically 'pulls the strings' of another" (224) by hacking into his cyberbrin (implanted cybernetic components that allow the brain to interface directly with information networks) in order to exert control or to implant false realities or memories.27 A third strategy, of particular relevance to the discussion in this essay, is the kind of unmasking so critical to ASFRian desire and fantasy. The Bellmerian disassembly of the gynoid at the beginning of the film, which sets the murder investigation in motion, will return in an uncanny sequence towards the end, when Batou and Togusa enter the mansion of the hacker Kim. In the middle of interrogating a grotesque, puppet-like figure whose e-brain Kim controls (raising the question of whether or not Kim is still alive), Togusa' s e- brain is hacked in such a way that the scene that we have just watched is repeated three times. In the first repetition, the puppet figure that Kim inhabits is now a doppelg√§nger of Togusa, who quotes freely from Jentsch's essay on the uncanny relationship between dolls and humans. The (seemingly) real Togusa watches in confusion when, suddenly, Batou turns mechanically towards him and his interior metallic skull ejects out of his head in the exact same manner as that of the wayward gynoid at the beginning of the film. This sequence of events sets off the second repetition: this time, the puppet that Kim inhabits resembles Batou, and the sequence ends with Togusa' s chest exploding to reveal an artificial interior. It is only in the third repetition that Togusa is freed from the virtual feedback loop in which he has been caught. This sequence, which employs all three techniques mentioned above, renders uncanny not only the characters in the film - both partly human and non-human, the investigators and the investigated - but also the film itself. Its kaleidoscopic repetition of events is confusing (particularly since Togusa is visible, so that the cinematic viewer is outside his point of view while being inside his hallucination)</page><page sequence="29">432 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) until we realize, along with Togusa, that an intervening force is at work. It also, as Brown notes, points to larger questions about "what it means to be human in a posthuman world and how we are to relate to all the ningy√µ (dolls, puppets, automata, and androids) that inhabit the world with us*' (234). To the extent that answers are offered in the film, they are partially inscribed by its representational approach to the bodies that populate its posthuman landscape. In conjunction with the above strategies of defamiliarization, Oshii adopts a style of animation that combines 2D and 3D rendering, which reinforces the critical distance between representation and reality, human and humanoid. The more lifelike the character, the more simply rendered and the more likely that it is a hand-drawn cell animation, whereas less animate objects are often computer- rendered in 3D. The contrast is made particularly apparent in a scene of an outdoor puppet festival, based on the annual Dajia Matsu Festival in Taiwan (see Oshii and Yamada 195), in which the larger-than-life, mechanical puppets are virtually realistic, while the living humans who move within and around them are both simply animated and partially obscured. The animation style of the film conforms to the aesthetic tenets of bukimi no toni or "The Uncanny Valley," a theory first articulated in a 1970 paper on robot design by Masahiro Mori, the man considered the father of Japanese industrial robots, but increasingly applied to computer-generated effects within animation and gaming.28 Inspired by Jentsch's essay on the uncanny, Mori suggests that as anthropomorphic creations become increasingly human, they create greater expectations of human movement, behavior, and appearance, and when those expectations are not met, they produce a creepy or uncanny feeling. His ideas are illustrated in a graph, which charts the degree of realism or humanness achieved (both in terms of Figure 8: The Uncanny Valley</page><page sequence="30">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 433 motion and appearance) and the resultant sensation evoked (see figure 8). At one end of the graph are toys and puppets, while at the other end is perfect verisimilitude, both ends of which, according to Mori, inspire various degrees of pleasure. The graph dips dramatically into the unpleasurable uncanny valley between these two points, where one finds prosthetics and, at the lowest point on the graph, the moving corpse or zombie (see Mori). Like Jentsch's theory of the uncanny, Mori's "Uncanny Valley" assumes the emotional investment and pleasure of humans in the non-human, offering an aesthetic program for enhancing that pleasure through a dedicated artificiality rather than a simulation of humanness. In so doing, Mori's views echo traditional Japanese aesthetics as influenced by Buddhism (Mori discusses the relationship between Buddhism and robotics in his 1974 book The Buddha in the Robot) - which tend to emphasize evocation over description, achieved via the interplay of opposite states, such as light and shadow or sound and silence. Thus they help to forge a bridge between current forms of technological embodiment and Japan' s historical legacy of dolls and puppets.29 Indeed, the current prototypes for Japanese humanoid companions, which tend to have a distinctly anti-realistic toy or puppet-like appearance, are often viewed as descendents of karakuri ningy√µ, autonomous mechanical or clockwork dolls that were popularized during the Edo period in Japan, which could perform a variety of tasks and entertainments, and whose goal "was not realism but charm" (Hornyak 25). Figure 9: A tea-serving karakuri automaton, circa 1800 (British Museum) One of the most popular karakuri was a childlike chahakobi ningy√µ or "tea- serving" doll, which is recreated in the uncanny mansion sequence of Ghost in the Shell 2. A small puppet-like figure, the tea-serving doll would travel across the room with a teacup on a small serving tray and, after the cup was taken, it would</page><page sequence="31">434 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 36 (2009) wait for its return to the tray, after which it would turn and travel in the opposite direction (see figure 9). The doll's ability to "perform the quintessential act of Japanese hospitality - serving green tea" (Horny ak 21) reflects Japanese cultural attitudes towards mechanical humans, including robotic humanoid companions, which are, as Hornyak notes, "social machines" designed primarily for "communication with human beings" (21).30 The subtle and abstract motion achieved by this "robot from the Edo period" has informed everything from bunraku puppet theater to the cyberbodies of anime, all of which use an economy of expression to achieve a maximum emotional impact, reinforcing the idea, expressed by Mori's theory, that the deepest chords of humanity are better struck through an intended artifice rather than through realism. Ghost in the Shell 2 recreates the legacy of Japanese ningy√µ, including dolls, puppets, and automated mechanisms (karakuri), and reminds us of their relevance to the cyberbodies of the current technosphere. To the extent that we either desire or revile such bodies, it is, so the film suggests, because we have compromised their "innocence" with our own projections of humanity. In repeatedly shattering our illusions through its various strategies of unmasking, the film illustrates the affective power of non-human bodies recognized for what they are - both "real and unreal, simultaneously more and less than human" (Bolton 745) - and it demonstrates the possibilities for recuperating an increasingly lost humanity in relation to such bodies. For example, while the character Batou is a visually static, largely artificial being, his relationships with his basset hound, Gabriel, and Motoko Kusanagi form the emotional center of the film.31 Like Haraway, whose Companion Species Manifesto on dog-human relationships echoes her "Cyborg Manifesto" in its concern for "an ethics and politics committed to the flourishing of significant otherness" (Companion 3), the film uses the relational interplay among a cyborg, a dog, and a networked ghost to gesture towards an ethical and emotional reciprocity outside of anthrocentrism. It is in the service of the relationship between Batou and Kusanagi, in particular, that, according to Oshii and Misaki Yamada (who wrote the novelized prequel to the film), the narrative structure of the "murder mystery" is used: The reason that Batou goes into enemy territory isn't because he really wants to rescue someone, nor is it really because he wants to solve the case. He just wants to meet his angel, Motoko. It doesn't really matter whether their relationship is a conventional romance or not. You see their love might seem cold to humans, but what is between them is no longer human, and now very innocent. (193-94) Batou is, perhaps, a figure not so different from the socially-alienated ASFRian, who chases the path of the exploding fembot in order to release the human imprisoned beneath her ideal fa√ßade. As in A.S.F.R., it is neither the body of the doll nor of the human that is important in Batou' s quest, but the interface between the two, where the ghost of his desire enters the picture. Illusions of humanity are shattered, and the film invites us, as spectators, to find something of ourselves within an increasingly posthuman, technofetishistic landscape.</page><page sequence="32">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 435 NOTES 1 . Gynoids are humanoid robots that are gendered female. Sorayama borrows the term from sf writers Gwyneth Jones and Richard Calder to describe his cyborg (part female/part machine) pin-ups.

This accounting of Parigi' s intentions in the film is based on two interviews that I conducted with him in 2004. 9. Plastination is a process through which the fluids of the body are replaced by a plastic resin that preserves specimens in perpetuity. The technique was invented and patented by the controversial anatomist Dr. G√ºnther von Hagens, who is best known for the traveling exhibition of dissected cadavers called Body Worlds (originally K√∂erperwelten). The climax of Love Object echoes that of the 1954 classic House of Wax, wherein the mad Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) seeks to transform a captive young woman into a waxen replica of his beloved mannequin Marie Antoinette, which was destroyed in a fire. 10. For those ASFRians who do own Realdolls, the appeal is often a partner with whom they can enact a robotic fantasy, which may involve adding circuits and wires to the doll's silicone exterior. 1 1 . For many ASFRians, the appeal of the artificial woman has, in fact, less to do with a love of the dead than what one ASFRian described to me as "the dream that goes on forever" - i.e., the fantasy of eternal life and beauty. 12. The exchange is archived on the Fembot Central website at: &lt;http://www.fembotcentral.com/viewtopic.php?t=7764&gt;. 13. Freud describes a game invented by his infant grandson for managing anxiety around the absence of his mother, which involves throwing away and retrieving a spool attached to a strine while repeating "Forti" and "Da!"

I was not surprised when I read a passage in Katherine Gates' s book in which she explains the appeal of the android Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) for a female ASFRian whom she interviewed. Gates refers to the autistic slaughterhouse designer, Temple Grandin, who also "feels close to him [Data] in his clumsy efforts to perform like a human and in his urge to sort out the mystifyingly inconsistent rules of human social behavior" (Gates 228). Laslocky makes a similar supposition about the doll owners whom she interviewed. Data, claims Gates, has gotten more erotic mail than any other Star Trek character, Spock coming in second. 15.

Derived from the word "saltpeter," Hospice de la Salp√™tri√®re was established by Louis XIV on the site of what had been a gunpowder factory. Less a hospital than a holding pen, it originally housed mostly indigent and insane women whom the Sun King wanted cleared off the streets of Paris; it incorporated a women's prison for prostitutes at the end of the seventeenth century; and it became the largest asylum in Europe between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The humanitarian and medical reform of the hospital is associated with Philippe Pinel (1745-1826), who became its chief physician in 1795; a statue in his honor still stands outside the hospital today. 17. On Freud and Charcot, see also Didi-Huberman (26-27). 18. Freud would later revise his "seduction theory," concluding that hysterical symptoms were less dependent on a reality-based sexual trauma than on projected fantasies and repressed desire. 19. "Private theater" was a term used by Anna O. for describing her "daydreams," which she explored with her analyst Josef Breuer, who collaborated with Freud on Studies on Hysteria (1895). Anna O.'s case formed the basis for much of Freud's discussion in the first of his Five Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1909). 20. As Hal Foster notes, "whereas surrealism began with hypnotic sessions, Dsvchoanalvsis commenced with the abandonment of hvDnosis" (2). 21. Following a paper published in the Annales Medico-Psychologiques in which psychiatrist Paul Ab√©ly condemned the attack on psychiatry (and the call for the murder of psychiatrists) in Breton's Nadja (1928), Janet took part in a discussion at the Soci√©t√© M√©dico-Psychologique in which he decried the work of Surrealists as "above all confessions of men obsessed, and men who doubt." Both the paper and discussion are reprinted at the beginning of Breton's "Second Manifesto of Surrealism" as a kind of initiatory prompt for the declarations that follow (119-23; the Janet quotation is from 121). Janet's L'Automatisme Psychologique was published in 1893; on its links with Surrealism, see Foster (1-5, n8, n221). Breton's Nadja, with its diatribes against psychiatry, was reportedly inspired by the author's personal encounter with a former female patient of Janet's. 22. Bellmer is generally discussed in relation to the Sadeian materialism of Georges Bataille, who invited him to illustrate his Story of the Eye (Histoire de l'oeil) in 1945. 23. Lotte Pritzel ( 1 887-1952) was a German artist best known for her wax dolls, which served as inspiration for Rainer Maria Rilke's essay, "Puppen" (Dolls, 1914). Pritzel's suggestion that Bellmer read Rilke's essay led him to explore his own obsession with dolls (see O'Reilly, par. 1). 24. See, in particular, Brink and Taylor. 25. For a theoretical analysis of fascist abjection that tallies with this discussion, consult Theweleit. 26. Locus Solus is a reference to the country estate of "a Jules Verne inventor-hero" named Martial Canterei (Ashberry 192) in the 1914 book of the same name by French poet, novelist, and playwright Raymond Roussel (1877-1933). Roussel, who received psychiatric treatment from Pierre Janet, used, in the construction of his novel, a writing method that was based on homonymie puns, which was intended to help him tap into his unconscious. Such techniques made him greatly admired by the Surrealists. The novel, which follows a group tour of Locus Solus, describes, through an increasingly involved series of vignettes, the mechanical wonders and "inventions of ever-increasing complexity and strangeness" showcased by the eccentric inventor for his guests (Ashberry 199). 27. For a more extensive discussion of both citationality and e-brain hacking in the film, see Brown. 28. See, for example, Bode, as well as Butler and Joschko.</page><page sequence="34">TECHNOFETISHISM AND A.S.F.R. 437 29. Jun'ichiro Tanizaki explains traditional Japanese aesthetics in the following way: "There is an old song that says 'the brushwood we gather - stack it together, it makes a hut, pull it apart, a field once more.' Such is our way of thinking - we find beauty not in the thing itself but in the patterns of shadows, the light and the darkness, that one thing against another creates" (29-30). 30. In 2003, when I attended Robodex in Yokohama, at the time the world's only humanoid robot exposition, there was an exhibit devoted to the tea-serving karakuri. 31. Gabriel was fashioned after Oshii's dog of the same name, who was brought into a recording studio so that she could also become the "voice" of her animated counterpart (Oshii and Yamada 191).

Edison's Eve: A Magical History of the Quest for Mechanical Life. New York: Knopf, 2002. ABSTRACT This essay interrogates the visual landscape of technofetishism, particularly in relation to the machine woman, using as a springboard a little-known internet community of technosexuals who collectively refer to their fetish for artificial bodies as A.S.F.R. (alt.sex.fetish.robots). Although A.S.F.R. was made possible by the advent of virtual communities, its fetishistic interests have historical antecedents that were documented in the early literature of sexology. Against their classifications of similar fetishistic practices as variations of necrophilia, as well as subsequent Freudian interpretations of fetishism as grounded in castration anxiety, this essay argues that A.S.F.R. is less about technology in general, or the artificial woman in particular, than it is a strategy of denaturalization that uses the trope of technological "programming" to underscore subjecthood. Like the trope of "hardwiring" - used within cyberpunk as a signal of the constitution of bodies and identities in relation to networked systems of control and power - "programming" serves as a metaphor for the biological and cultural matrices within which desire is articulated and pursued. "ASFRians" experience pleasure and agency through, in a sense, hacking the system, the visual indicators of which often take the form of a female android who has run amok, an image that is typically read as a threat. By drawing analogies between the uncanny artificial bodies at the heart of ASFRian fantasy and those fetishized by the Surrealists, in particular the disarticulated dolls of German artist Hans Bellmer, as well as those within the current technosphere as exemplified by Mamoru Oshii's anime Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), which was deeply influenced by Bellmer' s work, this essay offers an ontology of artificial women that is relevant to the critical understanding of mechanical bodies in popular culture, both past and present.</page></plain_text>
