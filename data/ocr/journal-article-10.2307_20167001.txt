At the Sacred Cenote For over a century, from at least a.D. 800-900, Maya lords?with perhaps noble Maya women among them? gathered on the plaza of Chichen Itza, probably on the buildings known as the Northern Platforms or on the steps of the great pyramid we now call the Castillo. They included in their number young men and women just on the cusp of puberty, and in a ritual that must have been reassuringly familiar?for how else to overcome the horror??they set off down the elevated causeway to Chen Ku, the "holy well," known as the Sacred Cenote today. There, from the small shrine on the south side of the deep natural sinkhole, some of these young men and women were hurled over the edge. What was the particular principle that guided this sacrificial practice? What belief was made tangible by this human offering? And when other offerings were made, what did the Maya at Chichen Itza believe would be the result? We have only a few clues from the era of the Spanish Conquest, when Chichen Itza was still ritually "alive," if basically uninhabited. In his Relaci?n de las Cosas de Yucatan, Bishop Landa promises the reader that, "We will tell about the well into which they threw living men in sacrifice, as well as other beautiful things" (1941:19). Additionally, he notes, "sometimes they threw living victims into the well of Chichen Itza, believing that they would come out on the third day . . ." (ibid., 120). Finally, in a more discursive part of his text, Bishop Landa adds that "into this well, they have had, and then had [sic], the custom of throwing men alive as a sacrifice to the gods, in times of drought, and they believed that they did not die though they never saw them again. They also threw into it a great many other things, like precious stones and things which they New research on Tula and Aztec chacmools was conducted by Marco Samayoa as part of his undergraduate senior essay (April 1996) in the History of Art at Yale. This research was supported by the Josef Albers Fund. Mary Miller wrote the final version of the paper during the academic year 1996-1997, supported by the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. The authors are particularly grateful for the many useful suggestions made by Karl Taube. prized. And so if this country had possessed gold, it would be this well that would have the greater part of it, so great was the devotion which the Indians showed for it" (ibid., 179-182). In making these statements, Bishop Landa expounds on Chichen Itza a number of times in his text?surely it made a clearer impression on him than any other ancient sacred place he visited?but he never explicitly denotes the Cenote as a place for worship of Chak or other rain gods, although the opportunity to say so was there. In fact, in later arguing that the primary motivation for a Cenote ritual was to supplicate rain, A. M. Tozzer must extrapolate from the general need for rain brought on by circumstances of drought, but not because of any specific text (1957:200). Additionally, from the custom of hurling sacrificial victims into the Cenote in order that they mediate with the gods for propitious agriculture, Tozzer deduced that the second goal of Cenote sacrifice was divination in general (ibid., 201). But further examination of the Tozzer text reveals that in fact he has drawn his inferences about ancient religious practices from those common in early twentieth-century Yucatan, particularly the rain ceremonies of the Cha-Chak that remain so important today. The texts he cites make no great claim for rain rituals at the Cenote, although most do mention drought. At the time Landa wrote, memories were still vivid of the 1536 Xiu pilgrimage that ended in their massacre at the hands of the rival Cocom lords (Landa 1941:54). The Xiu lineage was making an attempt to offer both male and female slaves to the Cenote; it was brought on, according to Landa, by famine, rather than by a desire for rain in and of itself. This may seem a technicality, but indeed, a plea for rain in order to sustain maize may have been conducted through the entity of the Maize God rather than a rain god. In fact, every source that Tozzer marshals for his evidence raises the larger concern of "abundance," or "sustenance," rather than just the question of rainfall (1957:chap. 7). In thinking about the meaning of the Cenote, modern adventurers and scholars have often focused attention</page><page sequence="3">56 RES 33 SPRING 1998 on the last part of Landa's statement without a great deal of attention to his other remarks. His commentary on the possibility of finding gold is one of few such signposts left by sixteenth-century commentators for modern archaeology, flagging first a significant location, a possibility for archaeological testing, and then, rather remarkably, proving to be right, successfully identifying the only substantial corpus of Maya gold. Additionally, of all the objects ever retrieved from the Cenote, only the gold foil disks have seemed to provide the narrative context for the Chichen Itza offerings. Because they seem to provide an internal narration with their multiple figures and because they can also be related to some paintings and sculptures, they have sometimes been the point of departure for understanding the iconography of the Cenote offerings (Tozzer 1957; Coggins and Shane 1984). But fascinating as they are, the gold foil disks are a tiny portion of the Cenote offerings. In fact, Landa's text is provocative, informing us that they hurled in (1) "beautiful things," among which we might count the gold disks; (2) human beings they believed would be resurrected but not seen; and (3) "precious stones" and other prized materials. The Harvard collection of Cenote material demonstrates that copal incense, often in association with rubber sap incense and frequently painted blue, was the most common offering. Among all Cenote offerings, jades are the second most numerous. There were also many wooden objects and dozens of textile fragments; we can probably assume that there were quantities of other perishable materials that may have been cast into the water. Interestingly enough, there were almost no stone artifacts of what the Maya would have considered "base" materials?granite or limestone. Indeed, as Landa noted, what the Maya threw into the well was "beautiful." One of the problems in making sense of the Cenote offerings has been that few individual artifacts bear relation to any other?but we can well imagine that certain clusters of objects may have once formed assemblages that could have been sent into the Cenote together. For example, dough or wooden idols could have been studded with much of the jade jewelry and adorned in elegant attire, as a few examples suggest; spangled turbans may have once featured copper bells or bits of cut shell. A gold mask was reconstructed (Tozzer 1957:figs. 213-216) that has proved to be identical to one worn by a masked figure in the low reliefs of the North Temple of the Great Ballcourt; a necklace of human teeth was reassembled, suggesting the sort of mutilation of captives seen on the north wall of Room 2, Bonampak, where captives have collapsed mouths. If, however, we return to the matter of the jade jewelry, we may have greater success at reconstructing an original configuration. Strung together, jade beads formed cuffs, collars, and necklaces, and the badly damaged pendants were featured at the centers of long strands (Proskouriakoff 1974:pls. 3-27). Earflare assemblages have been reconstructed. Other beads may have formed belt ornaments and headdress tiaras and diadems. How this jewelry found its way to the bottom of the well must be imagined, but we are left with essentially two choices: one, as worn by a victim thrown in the Cenote, or two, as separate offerings, perhaps inside a ceramic vessel. For most of this century, scholars have assumed that jade could be equated with water (for example, Thompson 1950). In making such a reading, they essentially derived the attribution from the Aztec goddess Chalchiutlicue, or Jade Skirt, a water goddess. But the ancient Maya had no water goddess, and the Maya rain god Chak wears only a modest jade necklace that appears to have little diagnostic value. Although most elite Maya lords wear jade jewelry for formal portraits, and Maya tombs include jade jewelry by the kilo, elaborate and abundant jade jewelry is the identifying costume of the Maize God. Furthermore, his costume could be worn by both men and women. For these reasons, in thinking about the Cenote ritual, we should reconsider the possibility that at least some of the offerings were in honor of the Maize God and that some of the human offerings sought to replicate his life cycle. To understand the cycle of life and death of the Maize God, we need to recognize that it constitutes the fundamental religious narrative of the ancient Maya. Buried within the better-known Hero Twin story of the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985) is the Maize God's story, with a host of related beliefs that seem in fact to be far more central to ancient religion than the elements of the Hero Twin narrative. Perhaps to the writers and tellers of the Popol Vuh, the story of maize was so obvious that it needed no explanation. Yet as both the main element of human sustenance and the stuff from which humankind was formed, maize and its ritual lay at the heart of the Mesoamerican belief system (Florescano 1993). The hidden story, then, is the story of the Maize God; this is the salient moment of Maya cosmology, and the Hero</page><page sequence="4">Miller and Samayoa: Where maize may grow 57 Twins, the sons and agents of the Maize God, must bring him back to life again and again by offering water and sun and by making his jade attire available to him in preparation for rebirth. As Karl Taube first pointed out, the Maize God is Hun Hunahpu, father of the Hero Twins, and one of the original pair of brothers to enter the Xibalba, the name given the underworld by the Quiche Maya of Highland Guatemala (Taube 1983). He and his brother fall to the Xibalba lords who sacrifice them; his head is decapitated and stuck in a calabash tree, and both bodies are laid to rest in the ballcourt. From the tree, Hun Hunahpu's head speaks to a maiden, and his spittle impregnates her, leading to her escape to the earth's surface in order to deliver the Hero Twins. Their exploits needn't be retold here, but after their victory in Xibalba, they bring their father back to life. As the Maize God, Hun Hunahpu relives a cycle of life, death, and resurrection in Maya art. He can be attended by his sons (fig. 1) who provide him with water and seemingly coax him up from the earth. When dormant, his jade costume is apparently stored in large bowls, awaiting the time of resurrection and reattiring. His sacrifice is usually by decapitation (fig. 2, Princeton pot); then, renewed and restored to his jaguar throne, he may seek revenge on God L, who otherwise seeks to occupy his place (fig. 3). The Maya focused on the Maize God as an ideal, in both his costume, which set sartorial standards for both men and women, and in his human form, which is young and essentially without gender. The Maize God drips with jade, the precious material identified as a permanent manifestation of maize itself, configured into particular adornments: diadem and headband (with quetzal feathers), necklace and face pendant, ballgame yoke with spondylus shell, beaded overskirt, bands for wrists and cuffs, and jade earflares and counterweights. The Maize God affirmed his role as the source and guarantor of abundance by the very exhibition of such wealth. His opposition to God L, and even his revenge upon him, may derive from the two roles that each deity plays in sustenance and commerce: the Maize God as the embodiment of maize growth production, God L as the merchant god who manipulates wealth and trades the maize. Scholars have long suspected that Maya funerary imagery dovetailed with the Popol Vuh narrative, and Michael Coe has thought that the dead king harrowed hell, following the footsteps of Hunahpu and Xbalanque, who overcame Xibalba (Coe 1973). But as students of the narrative have come to understand the meaning of the story better, they have come to see that funerary rituals may have focused on the reenactment of the life story of the father, the Maize God, with the Hero Twin Figure 2. The Princeton pot with God L enthroned. Rollout photograph: ? Justin Kerr.</page><page sequence="5">58 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 3. Codex-style pot with the revenge of the Maize God. Rollout photograph: ? Justin Kerr. sons in attendance. It is he who must be resurrected and adorned, so it may well be in his costume that the dead king enters the tomb. The interment of paired sacrificial victims with a dead king, particularly in Early Classic Tikal, may have been the final element of the reenactment of the resurrection story by placing the nurturing Twins at the Maize God's side, thus creating a burial tableau that parallels the painted imagery. Bishop Landa recounted how the Maya planted a single jade bead in the mouth of the deceased. He considered this a sort of currency for the afterlife but, in fact, these jade beads probably symbolize maize kernels "planted" in the dead as a promise of renewal (Landa 1941:130). From their captives, the victorious warriors at Bonampak plucked the jade beads and feathers, to brandish them as the greatest prizes. "Jade and quetzal feathers" was the very metaphor for precious, for being of intrinsic value, to the Conquest-era Aztec speaker. This metaphor must have had its origins generations deep in Mesoamerican antiquity, for the jade bead is the kernel of maize, the quetzal plume the waving stalk of the plant; the metaphor is Maya, if not Olmec (Taube 1996). The imagery of maize renewal penetrates Maya art widely and is even the subject of some of its most famous monuments. On the Sarcophagus Lid of the great king Rakal of Palenque, the king is depicted at the moment of death; he is reborn as the Maize God, adorned in his costume and falling into a giant hieroglyph of the "black hole," the Maya underworld (fig. 4). Additionally, in a less elaborate representation, Stela 11 at Copan also features a posthumous depiction of a king over an opening to the underworld and once again in the guise of the Maize God (fig. 5; Taube 1992:48). Both images of dead kings also feature aspects of God K, and the Stela 11 figure has sometimes been identified with that deity (Schele and Freidel 1989:337), but on Stela 11, maize foliage sweeps back from the lord's cranium. Frontal images of the Maize God include prominent large beads centered on the forehead, through which tresses are pulled, compounding the identity with God K. The large maize gods from the cornice of Temple 22 at Copan display such beads with hair pulled through them (fig. 6). Underworld openings, as figured at Palenque and Copan, were understood by the Maya to occur as caves and cenotes, the greatest of which was the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza (cf. Stone 1995). So some very specific relationship between the Maize God and the black hole may have made the religious ritual come alive at Chichen Itza, as the process of making offerings may have manifested. The largest known corpus of worked Maya jades comes from the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza (fig. 7). Of the many Cenote jade plaques, most feature seated figures: they sit in underworld portals, amid maize foliage, or dance with dwarves. In fact, dwarves occur more commonly as representations in jade than any</page><page sequence="6">Miller and Samayoa: Where maize may grow 59 Figure 4. The Palenque Sarcophagus Lid.

Drawing: Courtesy of Karl Taube. other medium, followed by their frequent rendering as the dance partner of the Maize God on Holmul-style Maya pots. Such dwarves, many of whom dress like the Maize God, may be personifications of the stunted second ear that a maize plant often issues. Additionally offered in the Cenote are many three-dimensional jade heads that also represent the Maize God, recognizable by the explicit, naturalistic foliage growing from the heads. Other jade offerings to the Cenote compound the ideology of maize; small cobs were hurled into the Cenote, as were small jade turtle shells, images of the rounded back of the earth from which maize springs time and again. Beads probably formed necklaces, anklets, and wristlets?the costume of the Maize God himself. In short, the practice replicated the larger configuration of the Palenque Sarcophagus Lid in which deified maize entered the "black hole"?here the Cenote?as part of the life cycle of maize itself. 2. Maize and chacmools Despite a steady stream of valiant efforts, the Mesoamerican chacmool has remained as enigmatic as ever, a sculptural form of remarkable standardization yet Figure 6. Maize sculpture from cornice of Structure 22, Copan. 89.7 x 54.2 cm, British Museum. Photograph: ?Justin Kerr. with little associated identifying iconography (fig. 8). Unlike so many other Mesoamerican sculptural forms, the chacmool seems to have thrived relatively unchanged in culturally diverse environments, from Terminal Classic Quirigua to Chichen Itza to Tula to Tenochtitlan, and from perhaps as early as a.D. 800 until 1521. In recent years, Michel Graulich has argued that the sculptures represent two groups of sacrificed humans, slaves and prisoners of war, who upon death became deified rain spirits, theTlaloque, and cloud warriors, the Mimixcoa, respectively. Reinterpreting a passage from Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc, Graulich has argued that there is evidence that the sculptures themselves were the loci of heart excision (1981). Alfredo Cuellar has put forth an interpretation proposing that the sculptures commemorate ritual intoxication (1981). Mary Miller has proposed that the origin for the sculptural format of the chacmool lies with the Classic Maya and that its iconographie associations are with Tlaloc and warfare (1985). New archaeological discoveries, particularly at the Aztec Templo Mayor, have fueled discussion of chacmools. With its conventional reclining posture, bent knees, and head turned 90 degrees from the body, a chacmool is unmistakable. What we propose here is that further</page><page sequence="8">Miller and Samayoa: Where maize may grow 61 Figure 7. Jades from the Cenote, Chichen Itza. Plate 27, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Jades from the Cenote of Sacrifice, Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Peabody Museum Memoirs, vol. 10, no. 1. Copyright 1974 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. consideration of associated iconography, offerings, and related sculptures may shed additional light on the meanings and origins of the chacmool. Furthermore, we have come to believe that Jes?s S?nchez, who in 1877 was the first scholar to study chacmools, may have been right when he proposed that the sculptures may be associated with Mesoamerican maize deities (1877), as may be seen in light of the Cenote ritual. On the surface of it, the theology of maize may not seem a likely subject for chacmools. Maize has two featured depictions in Maya art: one as the decapitated ear of corn, frequently with distinctive face paint (what Karl Taube has called the Tonsured Maize God) and the other as tender growing corn in full foliation, or the Foliated Maize God. Among the Aztecs, Cinteotl took the role of the Tonsured Maize God, and Aztec and</page><page sequence="9">62 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 8. The chacmool excavated by Augustus Le Plongeon, Chichen Itza. Photograph: Mary Miller. Maya versions bear similar face paint. Young maize is less specifically rendered in Central Mexico, although the goddess Xilonen may have had this role. Generally, maize gods have been thought to be absent from most Central Mexican imagery until the Late Postclassic period (Miller and Taube 1993:109). At Chichen Itza, the Maize God plays a key role in the imagery of the Great Ballcourt and associated buildings. In the Lower Temple of the Jaguars, he is reborn from a turtle shell, in an image analogous to those on painted ceramics. More complex and specific to Chichen Itza is the Maize God imagery of the North Temple of the Great Ballcourt, where an enormous prostrate maize god, larger than any other figure, lies in the lowest register with a pair of serpents emerging from its belly (fig. 9). Additionally, at the base of the west column of this same temple, two reclining maize gods rest back to back, adopting the exact pose of the chacmool (Schele and Mathews 1998:chap. 6). This recumbent posture is characteristic only of captives of the southern lowlands, with one striking exception: the portrayal of Pakal, king of Palenque, on the surface of the Sarcophagus Lid. There, as we have already seen, Pakal falls into the "black hole," simultaneously yielding a reborn world tree. On the west column of the North Temple at Chichen Itza, the Figure 9.

It is our hypothesis that this recumbent posture becomes codified in that of the chacmools at Chichen Itza. As the basis of society, as the underpinning on which all else depended?from life itself to successful commerce?the Maize God offered himself as sacrificial victim. But maize iconography, other than posture, can be seen in few chacmools. To understand the specific maize ideology we must turn to Tula, where the chacmool form also flourished, and whence it was transmitted to the Aztecs. 3. A Maize God from Tula: the chacmool connection In 1954, during the tenth season of excavation at Tula, Hidalgo, Jorge Acosta uncovered the only complete and undamaged chacmool ever found at that site, apparently in its original Toltec setting?as opposed to what Acosta generally found in his excavations: the later Aztecs had smashed chacmools and sacked associated caches and offerings (Acosta 1957:166-167). In fact, in the case of the Burned Palace, the Toltec roof had long before collapsed and the Aztecs, apparently unaware of what lay underneath, had built a new chamber above it, all prior to a subsequent destruction of the palace by fire. Directly behind the Tula chacmool was a bench (fig. 10), and within the bench was buried a lidded stone cache vessel, painted red. Included with two shells and some shell beads was a stunning jade plaque (fig. 11 ). Although no other author investigated the plaque again, Acosta himself recognized some of its significance as well as its relevance to the chacmool found directly in front of where the jade plaque was cached (1957:152). Acosta noted that this full-length portrait of a male features closed eyes, probably indicating death, and he also noted that the figure holds a disk to its abdomen, like the Tula and Chichen Itza chacmools. Acosta also believed the plaque's imagery to be directly related to the chacmool located in front of where the jade had been cached (1957:152). A reexamination of the Tula jade reveals additional details. First of all, the figure poses within open jaws that form a large, encompassing "U." The half circles that Acosta called "shoulder pads" are eyes of a War ut ^^ Figure 10. Burned Palace excavations with bench, cache ("ofrenda"), and chacmool.

Such jaws occur commonly in Maya writing and iconography where they indicate the "black hole" of the underworld. The Palenque Sarcophagus Lid offers the most elaborate iconographie form of these jaws (see fig. 4). The Tula plaque figure also wears a large central bead in his hair, as well as the luxuriant tresses characteristic of the Maize God. This small plaque would seem to be a miniature and condensed configuration of the maize god imagery seen in fuller form in monumental Maya art and particularly as configured at Chichen Itza. Additionally, the material of the plaque itself?jade? suggests an association with maize, as students of Mesoamerica have always known. Recently, Karl Taube has argued that celt forms, from Olmec times onward, are consistently associated with maize and maize gods (1996). Securely dated by context to the Toltec era, the Tula plaque may also be one of the last jade plaques of its shape to have been made in ancient Mesoamerica. Consideration of other jade plaques, including the archaeological ly documented materials from Nebaj and the corpus from the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, reveals that jade carving usually features the subject of maize gods (Smith and Kidder 1951; Proskouriakoff 1974). The figure on the large Nebaj plaque (fig. 12), for example, sits enthroned within what is probably a U shaped opening, surrounded by maize foliage, and accompanied by a dwarf, the standard companion of the Maize God. With his headdress of the principal bird deity, or Itzam-Yeh, this representation also recapitulates the theology of the Palenque Sarcophagus Lid, with the Maize God at the underworld opening, yielding the resurrection of the World Tree, topped in turn by the principal bird, or Itzam-Yeh (Schele and Miller 1986:265-291). Acosta sought to replicate his success in Tula's Burned Palace, but he never found another complete chacmool/bench configuration that the Aztec had not already looted. He did find an intact cache within a bench, however, and although the offerings are similar in number, material, and subject, they are also simpler, and the jade plaque features a single standing figure with closed eyes, much like that of the Burned Palace plaque (fig. 13). Similar but substantially more elaborate caches also turned up at Chichen Itza, usually in the context of chacmools. At the Temple of the Chacmool, for example, the cache was deposited directly behind the chacmool; at the Castillo, the cache lay under the north stairway, deep within the buried substructure under the Castillo chacmool and its associated red jaguar throne. Figure 12. Nebaj-style jade collected atTeotihuacan with Maize God and dwarf. Photograph: ? Justin Kerr. The relationship of the thrones to the chacmools is probably relevant. The red jaguar throne featured a mirror back, or tezcatcuitlapilli, on its seat, but on the tezcatcuitlapilli lay three large jade beads, one an anthropomorphic head forming a triangle, or what Karl Taube has called the "jade hearth" (Taube n.d.). As Freidel, Schele, and Parker first argued, in addition to the narrative spelled out above, the Maya believed the Maize God to have been born at the dawn of creation from the three hearthstones of the earth (1993:chap. 3). Once reborn, he takes his place on a jaguar pillow or throne, which in turn is one of the three hearthstones. In setting out these large jade beads, Maya lords at Chichen Itza were setting the stage for the rebirth of the Maize God on the jaguar throne inside the Castillo, in direct association with a chacmool, the recumbent and dying Maize God. The similar cache in the Temple of the Chacmool was buried in what the Carnegie archaeologists believed to have been a destroyed throne, repeating the configuration. Buried under the throne, these beads of jade form not only symbolic hearthstones but also symbolic kernels of maize, ever buried, ever yielding forth the young Maize God enthroned above, given life through the king's continual reuse of his seat. Acosta's remarkable discovery at Tula reveals the same belief system; what he found buried in the bench were the trappings for the reborn Maize God, waiting for him within the very throne from which he would reign. Furthermore, the tezcatcuitlapilli disk is what we might call a centering device, a world navel describing</page><page sequence="12">Miller and Samayoa: Where maize may grow 65 the liminal point of contact between this world and another. In combining a jade necklace with a tezcatcuitlapilli in a consistent fashion, the Maya at Chichen Itza seem to be setting the location and the vehicle for the rebirth of the Maize God, who could then be reborn through the disk and find his apparel awaiting him. Elsewhere, Mary Miller has argued that the posture of the chacmool developed out of the recumbent pose of Maya war captives of the Classic period and that at Chichen Itza the chacmool first came to take on the role previously held by the altar, the subject of which is almost uniformly associated with sacrifice across the Maya realm. The associated thrones and benches at Chichen Itza replaced stelae, revealing that the role of ruler at Chichen Itza became more important than the individual in that role (Miller 1985). The transformation of the individualized, named captive into the generalized and codified chacmool additionally emphasizes the sacrificial role played by the captive rather than his name and rank. Figure 13. A Tula jade plaque from another cache offering. After Jorge Acosta, "Resumen de las exploraciones arqueol?gicas en Tula, Hidalgo, durante las V, Vil, y VIII temporadas, 1946-50." Anales del INAH 8(1956):106. Reproduced by permission of INAH. At Tikal, Caracol, and Tonina, among other sites with specific iconography carved on altars, captives on altars frequently recline or lie prone on open quatrefoils, openings to the underworld. Along with altars commemorating katun endings and ballcourt markers, both of which also feature the quatrefoil frame, these images show the actions and offerings that open the underworld orifice. Associated stelae often feature the king in the guise of the Maize God, the sacrifice on the altar nurturing the renewal of maize. Thus from the southern lowlands and Chichen Itza to Tula, a central tenet of Mesoamerica religion was underscored by the throne/chacmool, stela/altar. As we have noted, on Stela 11 at Copan (fig. 5), the posthumous portrait of the king renders him as the Maize God, above the "black hole." Within that hole is a small bundle, topped with long, springy quetzal feathers. What's inside the bundle? We cannot know for sure, but the Maya rendered maize silk as quetzal feathers, and like the later Aztec, the Classic-era Maya may have spoken metaphorically of jade and quetzal feathers to mean both actual maize and the concept of supreme preciousness. In the Bonampak murals, in the scene of captive presentation, the war captain holds out a jade bead and a bundle of quetzal feathers, the valued attire of the defeated warriors shown at the captain's feet. Jade and quetzal feathers also describe the attire of the Maize God. When the victorious Bonampak lords stripped the defeated of all valued booty, they "husked" their captives; not surprisingly, a severed head, like a harvested ear of corn, also lies at the feet of the lords. Maya lords often dressed their captives for sacrifice with a simple, precious ornament?a strand of beads or a diadem; by this act, they may also be preparing them for the endless cycle of fertility and renewal characteristic of the Maize God, who is also dressed by attendants in renderings of his life cycle. The metaphor of precious jade beads and feathers is also used to describe a newborn infant. When an Aztec midwife addressed the newborn, she called it "my youngest one, my precious noble one, precious necklace, precious feather, precious one" (Sahagun 1950:6:168). Additionally, she distinguished the healthy newborn from one "born as a little smutty ear of maize" (ibid.), thus identifying the healthy one as a wholesome ear, free of such fungus. The midwife called the parents the "possessors of these precious necklaces, the possessors of these precious feathers" (ibid., 149), as if to specify that it is they who adorn and give life to the infant.</page><page sequence="13">66 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Karl Taube has written about the concept of the kex, or substitute offering made at birth, to satisfy dangerous gods (1994:669-672). The sacrifice made is often understood to be maize seed, human flesh, or some sticky substance that the gods might accept. The concept of kex may also have required human sacrifice, particularly to ensure, for example, that the difficult passage of another being would be eased, such as the passage to kingship. The feather-adorned bundles that rest in the chest cavities of sacrificial victims depicted at Piedras Negras may indicate a kex sacrifice, in both the bundle and the victim itself. Strikingly, at least one example would appear to reveal a crosshatched cutaway of the contents within the tiny bundle, perhaps revealing them to be maize seed corn. Additionally, Taube has argued that the captives at the base of Piedras Negras Stelae 11 and 14 signify the jaguar babies so often sacrificed by Chak, the Maya rain god, on painted vessels and are the kex offering required for installation of the king in the niche above (1994:672). The ladder leading to the niche indicates the world tree, with the sky band framing the divine order in which the new lord takes his seat (Taube 1988). Earth monster jaws, more stylized than those on the Palenque Sarcophagus Lid, flank the captives, the wooden ladders providing both the physical means and the psychological transition for the enthroned lord. Although the newly seated lord dresses simply, particularly in comparison with the lavish war costumes worn elsewhere at Piedras Negras, this simple costume emphasizes fertility and renewal. On Stela 6, for example, Ruler 3 wears a full cob of maize, husk pulled back to reveal the full, straight rows of kernels. On all niche stelae, the king wears lavish jade jewelry, the heavy collars and cuffs also characteristic of Maya funerary offerings. Although luxurious displays of wealth are common on Maya monuments, jade jewelry is the particular costume of the Maize God. Furthermore, sitting atop the niche is Itzam-Yeh, the principal bird deity. At Piedras Negras, as on the Sarcophagus Lid or the Tablet of the Cross at Palenque, the image of king as Maize God is complete, the sacrifice at the base apparently part of an exchange and guarantee of maize fertility, and the iconography that elsewhere encompasses both altar and stela is consolidated. Framed by serpents?whose use as symbols of renewal is inherent in their regularly shed skins?or yielding them up from its belly, the chacmool may be the locus for the ritual of renewal. The chacmool signifies the sacrificed maize, from which maize will renew itself, via the belly disk; the Maize God costume awaits a king or an impersonator, someone to sit on the jaguar throne or the jaguar cushion. In fact, we might imagine the ritual in the interior chamber of the Castillo. From the belly of the chacmool, young maize is called. A young Maize God impersonator then dons the jade costume and sits on the jaguar throne, simultaneously sitting on the tezcatcuitlapilli, reliving creation and emergence at a mountain that may have been the Maya equivalent of an Aztec sacred mountain, Coatepec (Schele and Mathews 1998:chap. 6). Then, with the sacbe (elevated road) to the north always in view, the living personification of the Maize God would be escorted to the Sacred Cenote, initiating the cycle once again. At the same time, the furnishings of the interior Castillo may well have marked the place for a reigning ruler to claim his role as the sustenance of his people. The identity between captor and captive may always have been sustaining the maize theology of Mesoamerica. Among the Maya, the reclining posture is limited to the Maize God and to captives?and perhaps these are overlapping categories. Mesoamerican warriors often identified with their captives. Aztec warriors called Figure 14. Sacrificial victims with what may be maize bundles on their chests, (a) Piedras Negras Stela 11 and (b) Piedras Negras Stela 14.

With the birth of the Maize God, according to Maya creation beliefs, the world tree can be set in place, allowing for the cosmos to be put in order. In the chacmool, we may well see the base that supports the erection of the world tree, anchored by an offering to be placed on the round disk of the chacmool. Kings take on the role of world trees: they wear their belief system down the central axis of their bodies, and they swaddle their reproductive organs in world tree iconography. Embodying the world tree, the king on the throne behind the chacmool represents a stable world order and an ordered cosmos. The Tula jade celt (fig. 11) would seem to indicate that this belief system could be reduced to its most salient elements and confined to a small hand-held object; a maize god enters the jaws of the underworld, symbolizing renewal. But the maize god of the Tula celt, like some Maya counterparts, is probably reclining, not standing; notice the outward lean of the knees, which could be an attempt to represent his unusual posture; the artist may have been trying to indicate that the figure is lying down. Additionally, if one only imagines what it is like to hold such an object in the hand, one realizes that the figure reclines almost any way it is held. Furthermore, the Tula celt figure presses his hands together, forming a circle; placed on any surface, the object becomes a miniature chacmool. With its hands centered over the navel, holding a tiny disk, the figure on the Tula plaque additionally forces reconsideration of another group of sculptures. In Central Mexico, just at the period of the invention of the chacmool, a plain disk is often held over the navel, representing tlalxicco, or what the Aztecs called the World Navel, the place of emergence. On at least two stone sculptures from Central Mexico, it appears to be women who hold these disks, but in a relatively unusual twist, the women are warriors (Taube 1992:103). This disk at the point of emergence notes a liminal node where access to this world and another can intersect. The disks held by chacmools at Tula and Chichen Itza are probably indicators of such liminality, where sacrifice can be received and be transformed. Among the later Aztec, the cuauhxicalli takes this position at the center of the chacmool's body. Known as a vessel for human heart offerings, the cuauhxicalli has dominated the interpretation of the disk it replaced? and in turn, of the chacmool itself. But cuauhxicallis can hold almost any offering, as even casual examination of the Codex Borbonicus demonstrates. The surviving cuauhxicallis, in fact, offer good evidence that they, too, encompassed the concept of tlalxicco; the Stuttgart cuauhxicalli, for example, features 4 Ollin, the predicted date for the end of the world, on the interior of the base, but the earth monster rests on the bottom of the vessel, the very maw of the underworld. 4. Aztec chacmools We may well ask ourselves what the Aztecs did when they explored ancient Tula, looted its treasures, and sacked some of the major monuments. We know that the sculptural forms of ancient Tula?standard bearers and chacmools among them?took a featured role at Tenochtitlan. Two chacmools have been discovered in situ at the Templo Mayor, on the Tlaloc side of the temple. The first chacmool of the Templo Mayor is only a bust, a contorted sculpture of a palsied face, tying the chacmool figure to Tlaloc, whose watery paradise drew disfigured forms. The second chacmool, dating to the late fourteenth century, is closely linked to Toltec predecessors in both form and material (Townsend 1992:94-95). But this early sculpture has an odd feature: it wears an unusual abbreviated, triangular, female upper-body garment, or quechquemitl, like that of some losing Maya warrior figures at Cacaxtla (cf. McCafferty and McCafferty 1994). Like those Maya figures at Cacaxtla, the chacmool wears lavish jade adornments. The attire may indicate humiliated captive status, and the message of such costuming would have been clear to an Aztec viewer. By virtue of being found on the Tlaloc side of the temple, clear associations with that deity and his complex can also be established (Miller 1985; Graulich 1984). Three more related chacmools, none with a specific architectural provenience but all probably from the last great era of Aztec sculpture, survive today. The most elaborate of all turned up a few blocks from the Templo Mayor, on Pino Suarez Street, in 1942 (fig. 15 a-c). Esther Pasztory has argued that it, along with a handful of other archaistic sculptures, were made in a single workshop in Tenochtitlan (1983:175). We might well imagine that the loot of Tula found its way to such a workshop, where ancient forms and ideology were reworked for a new audience. To such a workshop, in</page><page sequence="15">68 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 15. Aztec chacmool excavated near Pino Suarez Street, Mexico City; (a) front, (b) top, (c) base. Photographs: Courtesy of Slide and Photograph Collection, Yale University.</page><page sequence="16">Miller and Samayoa: Where maize may grow 69 fact, may well have been delivered the entire haul of a sacked Tula chamber: sculptures, including a chacmool and its associated bench cache of jades, and other treasures, all to serve as models for fresh imperial sculptures for the Templo Mayor. The sculptors of this atelier made a new type of chacmool, giving it a set of more overt Tlaloc associations than any previous chacmool. The chacmool wears the mask of Tlaloc and Tlaloc adorns the cuauhxicalli he bears in place of the sort of disk used in earlier versions. Carved on the base is Tlaloc once again, but this Tlaloc is one specific to the Templo Mayor, where a single aspect?a twisted cruller over the nose?of a Maya solar war god, the Jaguar God of the underworld, has been incorporated by Aztec artists, offering a revival of Tlaloc's ancient associations with war and earth. The reclining figure himself wears elaborate beads strung into cuffs and necklaces, and the outer ring of the necklace features oliva shells, a common element in Classic Maya costume. Plumes cascade from the headdress band, and its style is one from the distant past, a similar "war-bonnet" headdress having been worn by a Maya king, Shield Jaguar of Yaxchilan, in the early eighth century. But most archaic of all is the necklace pendant, for it features a seated lord of an earlier era, and Pasztory has suggested that this represents an actual heirloom. We agree, and we propose the following model: such a plaque would have come from a stone vessel interred behind a chacmool, and its subject is probably the enthroned, resurrected Maize God. In sacking the past and then reassembling it, the Aztecs have essentially conflated the altar and its throne, making of the chacmool the image of sacrifice and renewed maize, all in one. Michel Graulich has turned to a compelling text of the sixteenth-century chronicler Alvarado Tezozomoc to argue that the Aztec chacmools served as the vehicles of communication with theTlaloque, a group of rain and weather spirits who dwelt in the Tlaloc mountains (1981, 1984). Tezozomoc noted that at the dedication of the Great Temple in 1487, the ruler Ahuitzotl carried out sacrifices on a stone that featured a turned head. Such a description well suits the chacmool and may in fact refer to such sculptures (Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975:515). For Graulich, this evidence confirms the associations that Tlaloc and the Tlaloque have with chacmools, and although he revisits the old Jes?s S?nchez interpretation (1877) of the stone as a maize god, he simply sees the possibility of subsuming maize agriculture under the larger ideology of rain. Although the overall location of the sculpture in Tlaloc's temple has merit, as does the passage from Tezozomoc, we believe that as in the reading of the meaning of the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, it is maize that is the dominant ideology, with rain in association. Because of the importance of maize agriculture, maize ideology, and the absolute value placed on jade, the most permanent material in ancient Mesoamerica, the artifacts that reveal the significance of maize are not only more likely to have survived into our modern-day present, but were also more likely to have survived in the past, even to have been kept as heirlooms. So, as with the Aztec chacmool, extraordinary works or configurations of material may have provoked one culture to rework the past of another, even when the particulars of the ideology that created an object were no longer current. For example, in his recent study of Olmec maize theology, Taube has demonstrated the role of the celt itself in maize ritual. Olmec maize gods and maize god impersonators strapped such blades onto their arms, as if to symbolize the ears of tender maize growing from their flesh (1996:62-67). Although the strapped blade vanishes from Mesoamerican art for a thousand years, Tula chacmools again feature such strapped blades, and the Chichen Itza chacmools bear them occasionally. Some great Olmec objects were never buried: they stayed in circulation, fragments of a usable past to be mined and reinterpreted at some appropriate moment. Just as the Aztec revived the Toltec chacmool, so too might the Toltec lords have revived an aspect of Olmec imagery, "getting it right" to a certain degree but also ending up with something altogether new. Surely this is the case with the Aztec chacmools. They recalled the defeated, effeminized captive in the polychrome chacmool in situ at the Templo Mayor, possibly even because of the role that female maize deities had taken on in Tenochtitlan. They also took the costume that the maize impersonator at Tula would have worn and draped it around the chacmool, making it both the sacrificed maize and maize reborn. On the bottom of the chacmool, the Aztec inscribed symbols of water, providing Jes?s S?nchez with his original rationale for thinking that the figure itself was maize, growing up from a watery culture. As it turns out, this forgotten scholar from the era of the maligned Mexican dictator Porfirio D?az was probably right, seeing in</page><page sequence="17">70 RES 33 SPRING 1998 maize the most important of the continuous threads that would link the Aztec chacmools with their Maya and Olmec predecessors. 5. The nineteenth-century chacmool As is widely known, the name chacmool was born at Chichen Itza, when Augustus Le Plongeon declared the great sculpture he excavated from the Platform of the Eagles in 1875 to be "Chaac Mool ... a true portrait of a man who has lived an earthly life" (cited in Salisbury 1877:77). Literally "great paw" in Maya if separated into its components chac and mo'ol, the word chacmool commonly means "jaguar." In other words, the word the Maya workers must have provided to Le Plongeon had no obvious connection to the reclining male figure he excavated. But did it make some sort of sense to the men who dug some 23 feet into the Chichen Itza ruins for Le Plongeon? Nearly seventy-five years later, when Jos? Erosa P?niche discovered the "fossil temple" buried intact within the Chichen Castillo, he did indeed find a jaguar, the now-famous Red Jaguar Throne, in perfect condition, at its summit, set with yet another chacmool (Erosa P?niche 1946). In other words, the workers who provided Le Plongeon with the name Chac Mool may have retained legendary knowledge of a buried jaguar at Chichen Itza, and the discovery of the reclining sculpture may have stimulated those memories. After all, Bishop Landa's experience of seeing Chichen Itza alerts us to the fact that the site was an active shrine for the Maya during the sixteenth century, despite the cessation of construction there over five centuries before. Surviving through the copying and recopying of Landa's manuscript is his notice of what he called the "principal building," with a remarkable description of its four radial and cardinally oriented staircases, each with 91 steps (Landa 1941:178), precisely the building where the jaguar throne would later be discovered. Given the state of both ruin and overgrowth that we might expect at Chichen Itza by the sixteenth century (evidenced by Landa's failure to see much of anything else at Chichen Itza?he mentions only four buildings altogether and does not include, for example, the Observatory, in which surely he would have been interested and would have mentioned had he seen it), we can interpret Landa's ability to see this particular building in such detail as evidence that the clearing and maintenance of the area from the Castillo to the Cenote continued into the Colonial period. In other words, Chichen Itza's role as a pilgrimage destination went far beyond the Cenote ritual. In all likelihood, the sort of ruins that Stephens and other later observers viewed at Chichen Itza were present in the main plaza only after Landa's day. With the real name of this particular class of sculpture now lost to us, we can do little more than seek to imbue the notion of "chacmool" once more with the complexity of its connotations. While still only imagining dredging the Sacred Cenote, Edward Thompson was struck dumb one day to see a Maya man from the highlands in earnest prayer at the Cenote's edge (1992). Until about a hundred years ago, the maize rituals that engaged ancient buildings, sculptures, and natural landforms at Chichen Itza may still have been alive.
