Who can watch this process and not wonder, as Aristotle did, whether there is a pur poseful intelligence at work? I could offer hundreds of other examples of such behavior. For millennia, structures built by animals have fascinated us in our incarnation as Homo teleologicus?seekers of purpose, design and meaning. To the Nobel prize-winning etholo gist Karl von Frisch, animal-built struc tures were a source of "awe in the face of the workings of nature." his view, biologists "convinced that they, or future generations of scientists, will ultimately find the key of life in all its manifesta tions" were obvious dullards "to be pitied." His target when he wrote these words in 1972 was an overconfident re ductionism that was promising to pro vide an ultimate answer to life?but at a Mephistophelean price: abandonment of the quest for purpose and beauty. To von Frisch, to make such a promise was hubris. The living world is rampant with beauty and purpose?a fact that he be lieved demands an explanation. 158 American Scientist, Volume 96</page><page sequence="2">There is irony in von Frisch's chal lenge, though, for he was speaking as a member of another tribe?Homo dar winiensis, if you will?which claimed to have discovered its own key of life. And so the problem could be put with equal force to Darwinians: How do they account for the living world's seeming beauty and purposefulness? The Darwinian "theory of everything" has always stood above its presumptive competitors because it came packaged with several "big problems," which could just as easily have been the theory's un doing as its vindication: altruism, sociality, organs of extreme perfection, and animal built structures. With respect to the last one, the basic problem is that when we build, we act as purposeful, intentional and designing agents. Yet it is Darwin ism's core assumption that such agency has no place in guiding evolution. When animals build things, some times appearing to anticipate, match or exceed our own capabilities as architects, what are we to think? Do we conclude that other creatures can also act as inten tional agents? In that case, the Darwinian vision of a world without such agency is undermined. Or do we conclude that our own intentionality is a quality apart, with no precedent in the living world from which we sprang? Drawing such a conclusion would be tantamount to succoring Darwin's b?te noir, Platonic es sentialism. This problem is not trivial: In deed, it drove a wedge between Darwin and his "co-Darwinist," Alfred Russel Wallace. Yet Darwin himself, confronted with the magnificent stmctures built by bowerbirds, resorted to attributing them to the birds' pursuit of "pleasure"?a purposeful agency if ever there was one. It is sobering to realize that only re cently has the problem of ar mal-built structures been brought firmly into the Darwinian fold. Two people are primar ily responsible for that having happened. One is Richard Dawkins, who argued in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype? his most original work?that the struc tures animals build are just one case of a broader tendency of genes to modify environments to their own benefit. The other is Mike Hansell, whose landmark book Animal Architecture (1984, reissued in a new and much revised edition in 2005) put the meat, so to speak, on Dawkins's dazzling speculations. There, Hansell sought to do what Robert Triv ers and the late William D. Hamilton did for the evolution of sociality and altru ism: frame the subject in such a way that specific testable questions could be asked about it. Animal Architecture was aimed at a scholarly audience, though, and so was not as widely read as it might have been. Apparently Hansell and his pub lisher have now decided to rectify this with a book for a general audience. Built by Animals is the welcome result. Hansell constructs his narrative around eight themes, ranging from a straightforward survey of which ani mals build things and which do not, to the relationship between intelligence and building, to the prevalence of tool making and tool use, to the role that appreciation of craft and beauty might have played in the evolution of animal building. The book is a fascinating read, with personal anecdotes and reflections blending into thought-provoking explo rations of the various themes. Hansell is an engaging writer with a remarkably clear and relaxed style, and he consis tently does his readers the honor of re specting their intelligence. In short, this is a book to carry off to a quiet room with a adding fireplace for a pleasant encounter with another mind. In some instances, the narrative works brilliantly. In the chapter on trap building, for example, Hansell poses a thought provoking question: Why is this activ ity rare among animals? It is a question that should intrigue anyone who has set a trap or watched a spider weave her snare. Hansell then springs a little trap himself. Such activity is, in fact, rare only among vertebrates, he says; doesn't this peculiar fact demand some explanation? In other instances, Hansell's approach is not so effective. His chapter on why brains are not required for an animal to be a builder digresses into a long discus sion of avian nest building that convinc ingly demonstrates (to me anyway) that brains are in fact quite necessary. For me, the most appealing aspect of Built by Animals is its forthright hon esty about the problem that animal-built structures have always posed to Homo darwiniensis: Do animals think about the world as we do, or do we only think they do? In an earlier time, asking such a question was verboten?Homo teleologicus crashing the reductionist party. The cli mate is different now, fortunately. As we come to think more deeply on big prob lems such as cognition and conscious ness, and as the overconfident reduc tionism of the past seems to be bumping up against its limits, von Frisch's chal lenge rises anew: How do we account for nature's awful beauty? Despite being single-celled organisms without any nervous system, some species of amoeba are able to build a portable shelter and carry it around for protection. The intricate "house" shown, which has a diameter of 150 microme ters, was built from grains of sand by Difflugia coronata. From Built by Animals. Although Hansell convincingly argues that Darwinian natural selection is in deed the best account we currently have, he is honest enough to admit that it, too, faces serious challenges and that meeting them may involve indulging in what has long been regarded as a dangerous in tellectual habit: anthropomorphism. We are more relaxed about such things now. Anthropomorphism has been demoted from unspeakable vice to mere sin, and this development has in turn led many to the discovery that sin has its uses. To quote Hansell, "I have to admit to al ways rather liking anthropomorphism not, I must emphasize, as an explanation but as a source of ideas." This proclivity comes out most strong ly in the last chapter, on the bowerbirds that so perplexed Darwin. Hansell finds himself drawing much the same conclu sion Darwin did?that bowerbirds, like us, are not simply apparent connoisseurs of the things they build, they actually are connoisseurs, driven largely by a striv ing for beauty, which may be much like our own. Hansell asks whether the bow ers are art, characterizing his question as "carelessly undisciplined.'' On the con trary: It is both intriguing and brave. /.
