<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pratap Chandra Ascent to humanism Expression of concern for man and his future is fast becoming a ritual for our times. If ever the gulf between C.P. Snow's 'two cultures' could be bridged, this concern has done it. Man appears to have at last become the measure of all things. However, as so often happens with rituals, appearances are, regrettably, gaining precedence over substance. Not many professed champions of the human cause appear interested in unravelling the basic rationale underlying their protestations or drawing the full logical implications from these. Going by the expressions currently fashionable, one gains the impres sion that all was well with man and his destiny till science and technology brought about revolutionary changes in the means of production during the last few centuries. Ever since then machines became the masters and humanity the humble servant. Since the future is likely to have more of technology with more of its desirable and undesirable products, there is an ever-growing danger of humble humanity becoming further humbled. And this trend, according to the protesters, must be fought. However, can we stem this onrushing tide of knowledge or at least change its direction? Should we go back to the golden past when man was man? Can machines be disinvented now? It needs no argument that none of these things can be done. Time moves only in one direction. Scientific and technological advances are far from transient phenomena or fortuitous accidents. They have come to stay. Then must we just bow to them and give up mankind's cause as lost and irretrievable? We can hardly do that either. What then is the alternative? Among other things, we can, and perhaps must, do something not quite in vogue these days—go to the basic philosophical assumptions which prompted and sustained this concern for man down'the centuries. Since there have been significant shifts in man's perception of his own worth, the process of historical development 63</page><page sequence="2">64 / India International Centre Quarterly must also be borne in mind. It may be useful to begin by underlining the conceptual confusion which is at least partly responsible for clouding the real issues. Anthro pocentrism has often been treated as a variant of humanism. The two are really successive historical developments, the latter to a certain extent implying and basing itself upon the former, but they are not the same in their content. 'Humanism' in its current connotation is a recent growth brought about, as we hope to explain, by factors .which in some ways also propelled the growth of science and technology and should be regarded as part and parcel of modernity. Anthropocentrism, on the other hand, is an ancient viewpoint. Most of early Indian and much of ancient Greek religious and philosophical thought was essentially anthropocentric. Man was central in these traditions for the simple reason that a personal, omnipotent, omniscient Creator did not find favour with them. What psychological factors enabled them to dispense with something which appears to be a well-understood emotional need, one can only speculate. Not that they were any the less superstitious or reluctant to believe in the supernatural for they posited a whole range of 'gods' capable of doing things ordinary mortals could not. But they were mere personifications of nature's powers or even phenomena and in their character they were not different from man. They could help or harm. They could even play with a man's destiny to some extent, particularly in the Greek tradition. But they were not Creators to whom man must surrender his will or towards whom he must feel grateful. They could pose no challenge to man's central position. Till the rise of the bhakti-cult in ancient India and Christianity in the West this state of affairs continued. There are some particular and unique features of early Indian thought which have not received as much attention as they deserved. The basis of karma-kanda or Vedic ritualism was the belief that the mantras were more powerful than these anthropomorphic gods. If the rituals were carried out correctly the gods had no option but to grant whatever boon was sought by whatever kind of man or demon. This faith in the efficacy of ritual practices has not completely left Hindu society even today. Karma-kanda in due course gave way to jnana-marga or the path of knowledge, but the anthropocentric character remained unchanged. The Upanishads, the Jainas and the early Buddhists were all thorough going individualists who claimed to show the way to liberation from the rounds of rebirths, a dogma not known in the Vedas. Every individual had to make personal efforts to get what would be only his. God's 'grace' is unknown in these systems. The doctrine of moral retribution— karma—finds its first expression in early Upanishads and is enthusiastically shared by the Jainas and the Buddhists. It categorically made man the</page><page sequence="3">Pratap Chandra / 65 creator of his own destiny and solely answerable for whatever he did. Saga Yajnavalkya declared twice in the Brhadaranyaka-upanisad, one of India's earliest philosophical texts, that everything derived its value through its relationship with man and that nothing was valuable in itself. As far as my understanding goes, the GM seems to be the first Indian text to represent a truly God-centred approach along with its emphasis on bhakti. The God-incarnate Himself claims to have created everything except the souls whom He calls His parts. Perhaps this prevented a wholesale abandonment of the man-centred approach. When an average Hindu of today blames his own past karmas for his misfortune the same anthropocentrism is shown at work, Similar assertion of man's own responsibility in shaping his destiny are perhaps not found in the ancient Greek thought. Moreover, a section of it betrays faith in fatalism as well as arbitrariness, both of which were incompatible with the well-known vedic doctrine of Rta. Yet, the first unambiguous expression of the anthropocentrist position—'man is the measure of all things'—was heard in ancient Greece. Whatever their other differences, the Sophists and Socrates shared a deep-seated faith in man's centrality. Greek Paganism, of course, was man-centred from the beginning. Even the great system-builders, Plato and Aristotle, though they did talk of God, had no idea of God-centrism of the Semitic type. Both these ancient traditions share another highly significant feature which is rather germane to the present discussion. The kind of free and utterly unfettered thinking we notice in them is perhaps not imaginable even in modern times. That society or a particular group in it could exercise some sort of thought-control over the masses was clearly unthinkable in those days. Both exhibit radical plurality, of both ideas and customs. Does it suggest that there is some logical connection between anthro pocentrism and freedom of thought? God-centred traditions, particularly those belonging to West Asia, are based on a claimed monopoly of truth, and such claims can be sustained only on unquestioning faith. They can permit free thinking only when a modus vivendi is established between science/philosophy and religion, as happened with the Renaissance and Reformation at the advent of modern times. Scientific activity remained dormant all through the Middle Ages primarily because the religious establishment was determined to exercise thought-control. Such was the depth of unquestioning faith that the now universally accepted theories, like geocentrism and evolution of man, could not be freely advocated when they were originally propounded in the West. In contrast, scientific activity was encouraged and honoured in ancient India and Greece. Which explains why Renaissance, in essence a reaction against medievalism, chose to go back to ancient Greek intellectual values.</page><page sequence="4">66 / India International Centre Quarterly Grand-parents make good friends for grand-children, as a historian of Western philosophy has remarked. Though there is no reason to think that the Greeks had any idea of 'Europeanness', the Europeans found it necessary to trace their intellectual ancestry to ancient Greece. The term 'humanism' is a modern invention. Since its Greek connec tion was so strong, many dictionaries still define it as 'revival of classical letters, individualistic and critical spirit.' A reaction against religious authoritarianism could not help being not only secular but also to some extent anti-religious, anti-supernatural, materialistic and hedonistic. As long as religion remained dominant in the West, humanists remained hostile to it. However, now we hear of 'religious humanism' also, represented by thinkers like Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Marcel. Present connotation of this term, particularly when it is used as an ideological label, lays greater emphasis on the assertion of 'dignity and worth of man'. This is obviously not the same thing as regarding the world as man-centred. Logically, the two are wholly separate ideas and it is really surprising how they have come to be confused. Humanism addresses itself to man qua man. Its main concern lies in discovering those intrinsic factors that distinguish man from other living beings and in work ing out the implications of man's worth and dignity. Anthropocentrism, on the other hand, is primarily interested in highlighting man's central place in the world. There is nothing particularly morally elevating in this doctrine. As a matter of fact, it looks like an outgrowth of the same herd-mentality that characterises a number of animals. Consequently, humanism demands and presupposes a much higher degree of sensitivity as well as a firm resolve to go wherever logic leads. Anthropocentrisms does not. Herein lies the explanation why ancient anthropocentrists saw nothing wrong in a number of practices and institutions which positively revolt a modern humanist. A few examples would be in order. Slavery was perhaps the bed-rock of all ancient civilizations. Both Plato and Aristotle deemed it necessary to lend support to this practice. Slaves were dealt with rather harshly in Greece as much as in India. The earliest Buddhist texts talk about the slaves moving about with tears in their eyes. And yet, even the Buddha, rightly regarded as the first explicitly egalitarian, humanitarian thinker, had not much to say against it. In an age where a number of runaway slaves like Makkhali Gosala, the founder of the Ajlvika faith, were becoming focal points of intellectual activity, the Buddha ordained that a slave could join his Order only after gaining the permission of his/her master—that is, after being freed, which could not have been too common. He virtually put a stamp of legitimacy on this now dreaded and abhorred practice. Similarly, ancient Indians were one with ancient Greeks in according an unequal status to women. Both Plato and Aristotle regarded them as inferior, as did the</page><page sequence="5">Pratap Chandra / 67 Manu-smrti in India. The Buddha made some advance, but even he showed his low opinion of women when it came to permitting them membership of the Order. He allowed it after much persuasion, and then laid down some conditions which were manifestly unfair to women. Even the seniormost and highly learned nun was expected to pay respects to the juniormost and ignorant monk. A woman could join after an express permission from her father/husband, not otherwise. To cap it all, a woman could never hope to win nirvana. She had first to reincarnate as a man! Dissatisfaction with the present-day conditions should not make us blind to the fact that the level of self-awareness is much higher today than at any other time. The content of humanism is a result of this development. Full implication of terms like 'dignity' and 'worth' took centuries to dawn on mankind. And the resolve to act upon that new-found wisdom also did not come in a day. In fact different societies appear to be at different levels of these two parallel developments. And yet the general direction of the movement is beyond doubt. One wonders if Sri Aurobindo had this spiritual evolution in mind when he prophesied a golden future for mankind. There is ample evidence to show that such an evolution is in fact taking place. There appears to be a syllogistic pattern in the onward march of the ideas. First a general principle—the major premise of the syllogism—is either consciously propounded or unconsciously evolved by an individual or a whole group. Undoubtedly some historical conditions cause this, though it would not be easy to believe that only material or economic factors predetermine the way the human mind works. A study of how this really comes about would indeed be fascinating, albeit largely speculative. Who or what, for instance, first felt and articulated that some special kind of dignity and worth attaches to man? Reflection on rationality and its implications—exercising of choice and acceptance of responsibility—must have had something to do with this. But who did the reflecting? Was he motivated by some selfish, group or class interest? But then, he was not singling out any particular group or individual. He was demanding attention for all mankind. The point is, once such a major premise becomes firmly established, at least among a section of intelligentsia, the rest follows almost logically, no matter how long it may take. Different people arrive at different minor premises and go on to draw conclusions conjointly from both the major and the minor premise. We are today at a particular stage of this syllogistic development vis a-vis man. A number of minor premises have been added to the one unchanging major premise and a number of conclusions have been drawn which are serving as different doctrines and tenets of social and political philosophy. But the process has not stopped and indeed, given</page><page sequence="6">68 / India International Centre Quarterly the way man's mind works, can never stop. Herein lies the hope for future. Speaking historically, one phase of this process found expression when 'liberty, equality, fraternity' came to be accepted as the distinguishing characteristics of modern democracy. The ancient world too had its republics, but they were not founded on these principles primarily because humanism as we now understand it was not acceptable to them. If man qua man has dignity and worth, how can we logically and morally deny every single human being a role and responsibility in social management? How can we have inequality of any kind? Gradual realisation of this led to crusades against slavery, untouchability, apartheid, racialism, sexism, imperialism—political or economic—and domination of all kinds. Commitment to liberty is behind similar opposition to totalitarianism and fascism. I had once heard someone speak disparagingly of 'the decadent philosophy of liberal humanism'. If the philosophy of humanism would ever decay, we would be robbed of all rational explanation for our &gt; attachment to equality and liberty! In the second phase following the establishment of democracy in some countries, humanism prompted an outcry against exploitation, resulting in the formulation of socialist ideologies of different hues. For long it was supposed that liberty and fight against exploitation are not compatible. We are these days witnessing valiant attempts to disprove this supposi tion. Another way of minimising exploitation was the establishment of welfare-oriented social orders. It needs no great perspicacity to see that no interest-groups could have brought about so many changes in perception, social norms and ways of thinking. This is quite evidently an inexorable historical process. Those who stand in its way are brushed aside later or sooner. The future is likely to have more and not less of equality, liberty and freedom from exploitation. The term 'human rights' could have been barely understood in the last century. Today, it has almost become a household word. 'Public opinion' or Rousseau's 'general will' is much more effective today than at any other time of history. Of course cynics among us can dismiss all this as insubstantial or even a fond dream, only they will have to unlearn a great deal of history! To end with another look at the confusion between anthropocentrism and humanism, it is worth noting that the world today is moving away from the former and towards the latter. Thanks to ever-growing environmental ism and concern for wildlife, not many will like to treat the world as merely a collection of artifacts for man's use. Like the seers of the Vedas, we are learning to seek bounties not for ourselves, not for mankind but for all living beings. □</page></plain_text>
