MILLERSTROM Abstract Marquesan prehistoric rock art, occurring throughout the island group, has not been systematically documented nor studied in detail. I discuss here the results of survey-generated data in the archipelago compiled between 1984 and 1989, and my recent work in Hatiheu Valley, located on the north coast of Nuku Hiva. Classification system, method of manufacture, geographic distrib- ution, architectural context and placement of motifs are described. Some broad conclusions are drawn as to the images' cultural sig- nificance. The Marquesas Islands Rock Art Project commenced in 1 984 under the direction of Maeva Navarro, director of Département d'Archéologie du Centre Polynésien des Sciences Humaines "Te Anavaharau" (hereafter C.P.S.H.), Tahiti. Headed by Edmundo Edwards, then chief archaeologist with the department, the project was conducted in collaboration with the author. The initial aims were to establish rock art site distribution, estimate the extent of rock art sites in the archipelago, and to evaluate the carvings' state of preservation. In this essay I report results from my examination of the Marquesan rock images in general and my recent work in Hatiheu Valley, Nuku Hiva, specifically. Based on my work to date I speculate on the function and meanings of images and suggest further directions for examining the rock art. I am primarily concerned with the pecked, incised and painted images on rocks; the sculptures (tiki) will be discussed elsewhere. Environmental setting The Marquesas consist of ten main volcanic islands, a number of islets, and a few surf-beaten rocks scattered into two groups spread over a distance of 350 kilometres (Figure 1). To the northwest are the islands of Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, and the two uninhabited islets of Eiao and Hatutu, to the southeast are the islands of 1 1 use the term "rock art" provisionally as it is embedded in Western connotations that have, in my view, little to do with Marquesan pecked rock images.

Total land area is about 1300 square kilometres. The archipelago is characterized by dramatic ridges towering up to 1200 meters above sea level, separated by deep, often narrow valleys, and with high cliffs falling abruptly into the ocean. Perennial and seasonal rivers and streams cut through the tropical forest on the wind- ward (eastern) side of the island, contrasting starkly with the arid "desert" leeward (western) area. It is clear that the islands supported a substantial pop- ulation in late prehistoric times. In most valleys a large number of prehistoric architectural structures extend from the beach area to the mountain ridges, suggesting that over time the indigenous landscape was trans- formed, modified and controlled. The notion that topographic barriers between the val- leys created social boundary prehistorically (Handy 1923) may not be true. The relatively homogeneous rock imagery throughout the island group suggests a great deal of inter-valley and inter-island contact always existed. Besides, the remains of many ancient trails con- necting various valleys are still visible throughout the archipelago. History of rock art research Despite a long history of archeological research in the Marquesas (e.g. Linton 1925; Suggs 1961; Heyerdahl and Ferdon 1965; Sinoto 1966; Kellum-Ottino 1971; Bellwood 1972; Skj0lsvold 1972; Ottino 1985; Rolett 1989), petroglyphs have not been systematically docu- mented or analyzed. Prior rock art investigations consist of reports and a few publications dealing with only certain aspects of the images (e.g., Steinen 1925, 1928a, b; Linton 1925; Metraux 1937; Danielsson 1954; Suggs 1961; Rolett 1986); rock art, however, was never the main focus of their Marquesan research. For example, Steinen dis- cussed the material culture extensively, but mentioned pet- roglyphs in general terms only (1925, 1928a, b). Ralph Linton (1925) documented the carvings that he discovered while mapping architecture and features. However, R. Linton and E.S.C. Handy of the Bayard Dominick Expedition arrived in 1920s, a century and a half since Western intrusion. Most of the ancient tradi- tions were no longer practiced, and many of the elders 181</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 .

Spots show concentration of documented rock carving sites. who might have remembered the islands' history had died. Some of the islanders were reluctant to show for- eigners ceremonial sites, as they believed a great number of the ancient places were tapu (sacred, restricted or pro- hibited). For instance, although early European settlers reported seeing petroglyphs in Hatiheu Valley, when Linton visited the area the residents said they did not know of any (Linton 1925:96). Linton declined to specu- late on the images' ritual functions. He wrote that "so few petroglyphs were found that it is unsafe to generalize about their occurrence ..." (1925:96). Only Suggs (1961:142-151) examined the stylistic development of images, establishing a tentative chronol- ogy based on their occurrence in dated sites. He con- cluded that the human stick figures (etua), dog, fish, whale and turtle were present during the Settlement Period (150 BC-AD 100) and Development Period (AD 100-1100). The human face motif (mata komoe) was a later development. Overall, the most frequent motifs were squaring of concentric circles, speared concentric circles (ipu), human stick figures and human faces. In his discussion Suggs compared the rock carving data with similar material from other east Polynesian islands and speculated on their link with Melanesia. 182</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Anthropomorphic figures a-e: stick figures; f-h: squared bodied; i-k; double outlined; 1-n: open body; o-r naturalistic; s-u: faces (not to scale). Human stone and wood sculptures (tiki), in contrast, have attracted more scholarly attention (Steinen 1925, 1928a, b; Handy 1923; Linton 1925; Heyerdahl 1965; Ferndon 1965). Excavations at Oipona me'ae (sacred place), Hiva Oa (Heyerdahl 1965:123-151) and at Paeke, Nuku Hiva (Ferdon 1965:117-122), yielded radiocarbon dates for the architecture that also provided a relative date for the stone sculptures. They suggest the tiki at Oipona were placed there approximately AD 1400-1500, while the sculptures at Paeke were incorporated into the structures circa AD 1600. These dates have significance for placing pecked rock images chronologically as they occur at both sites. Results of The Marquesas Islands rock art project Between 1984 and 1989, E. Edwards and I worked with various volunteers on all six presently inhabited islands: Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa, UaHuka, Ua Pou, Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. Images have been reported on remote Eiao Island (pers. comm. with yacht visitors 1993), but so far none have been recorded. Work was carried out in forty- one valleys and 6331 individual design elements (petro- glyphs), 1 10 wall paintings (pictographs), and eighty-one human stone sculptures were documented, sketched and photographed. In addition, numerous associated architec- 183</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Marine animals, dogs and birds (not to scale). turai structures and features were mapped. During the course of the project efforts were made to involve the Marquesans in our work by sharing information and location of sites discovered during the survey. Some pet- roglyph locations were already known to the Marquesans, but most were located as a result of our field survey. The vast majority of the sites were previ- ously unrecorded. Copies of scale drawings, maps, pho- tographs and reports are housed in the C.P.S.H., Tahiti. Additional copies of the material are kept at the newly established (1993) Centre de Documentation des Marquises "Pa'eviM", Taiohae, Nuku Hiva. Classification A classification scheme is an archaeological construct, but I believe it is a construct that in part reflects an ernie view of what was socially significant. In addition to facilitating management of a large data base, classifica- tion allows researchers to objectively determine image frequency, spatial distribution of image types, cultural and environmental association, preferred placement and location, stylistic variation as well as indicating stylistic changes over time. The 6331 documented rock images (excluding the sculptures), from the Marquesas archipelago were classi- fied into five distinct categories (Table 1). Material objects (category III) and Plant Forms (category V) occur rarely. Human figures (category I) occur in several distinct sub-classes with numerous variations in each cat- egory (Figure 2). However, circular geometric motifs (category IV), not human figures, constitute the largest category (Millerstrom 1990, 1992). Zoomorphs (cate- gory II), such as marine creatures, dogs, and birds com- pose the rest of the inventory (Figure 3). Numerically, geometries represent 66.3% of the total motifs recorded for the archipelago whereas anthropomorphs make up only 22.7% (Figure 4). Ubiquitous cupules - cup- shaped impressions on stones - are frequently placed on the same face of the rock as pecked figures; in some cases they are incorporated into the figure. They appear most often on horizontal surfaces but vertical placement also occurs. The connections between the figures and the cupules are unclear. Although cupules were always noted, they are not part of this discussion. Image classification Description I. ANTHROPOMORPHS 1.

Classification and description of the main Marquesan image categories 184</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Distribution of individual Marquesan petroglyph motifs (N=6331) Method of manufacture All carving and quarrying activities were preceded by chants and ritual observances (Handy 1923; Linton 1925). Carvings on stone, bone, ivory and wood were made by skilled craft persons called tuhuna (or tuhuka) ta ai (Dordillon 1931; Handy 1923). Not all petroglyphs, however, display the same fine pecked lines. Whereas many have thin even lines that obviously took some skill to produce, frequently carvings are poorly executed and appear unfinished. The act of producing a carving was more important than the finished product. While some of the petroglyphs (and the sculptures) depict females, it is generally assumed that in Polynesia stone carvings were done by men (Metraux 1940:137). This assumption, how- ever, has not been closely examined. Petroglyphs were carved on different types of basaltic stones such as on coarse vesicular basalt, dense basalt, and red and yellow tuff. Methods employed included pecking, pecking and abrading, and incising. Pecking only appears to have been the prevalent method used throughout the archipelago. The width of the carved lines varies from 0.5 to 4 cm. Similarly, depth of carved lines may range from 4 cm to shallow grooves that are barely visible. Although faint images may indicate erosion, generally the depth of carv- ings does not, I believe, correlate with age. Many pecked figures lack uniformity in depth and width of lines. The same figure may, for instance, display pecked lines vary- ing from 0.5 to 4 cm in depth. Bas relief and intaglio, both produced by pecking and abrading, are geographically unevenly distributed. While bas relief occurs in most islands, intaglio is a common method employed only on the north coast of Nuku Hiva. Bas relief images often occur on tuff slabs depicting human figures with the same characteristics as the free- standing sculptures. With hands most often placed across a protruding abdomen and legs slightly flexed, they usu- ally depict facial features as well as a crown or necklace {hei). With a depth of 6-10 cm the bas relief figures are sometimes pecked in such a way that they are almost detached from the support. Although the Marquesan bas relief images have not been dated directly they were probably a late phenomenon. A great number of bas relief figures are associated with sculptures and mega- lithic architecture dated by Suggs (1961) to the Classic Period approximately AD 1400 to 1790. Both Heyerdahl's and Ferdon's radiocarbon dates collected at Oipona (AD 1400-1500) and Paeke (circa AD 1600) fall within Suggs' cultural time period. In the Marquesas, superimposed images are relatively uncommon. Although overlapped images may suggest stylistic changes over time, they do not indicate the time span between the figures. However, overlapped images suggests that anthropomorphic stick figures are among the earliest motifs used. Incised figures depicting anthropomorphs, animals and geometric figures are rare and have only been found in a few circular or rectangular pits of sandstone and a clay like material. The function of these pits is uncertain. Handy (1923:189), however, examined a breadfruit storage pit in Atuona, Hiva Oa, and specu- lated that the carved horizontal design was an attempt to embellish the pit. Marking the pits to show tribal affiliation may be another reason for the presence of the carved figures. No specific carving tools have been found in the vicinity of the carved stones. Crudely made adzes from volcanic dikes or naturally pointed stones from nearby beaches or river beds may have been used and then dis- carded. As I was interested in the carving technique, aging process and time involved in the production of images on rock surface my colleagues and I conducted an experiment in Hatiheu Valley in 1989 (Millerstrom 1989b). A large uneven water- worn boulder located on the western side of Hatiheu beach was selected and unmodified pointed beach stones were used as pecking tools. To facilitate the repeated pecking a hammer-stone was used for added strength. We learned that with prac- tice, smooth, even lines could be produced by repeated pecking in the same area; thus, abrading may not be nec- essary. In addition we established that pecked anthropo- morphic stick figures were not labor intensive. A 40 χ 30 cm human stick figure, approximately 0.5 cm deep, was pecked in 30 minutes, while in 15 minutes a 5 χ 5 χ 4 centimetre cup shaped impression was pecked. Despite the boulder's constant exposure to salt water spray, rain and direct sunlight the figures remained unchanged in 1996, seven years later. 185</page><page sequence="6">Geographie distribution Rock images are found in many diverse settings from the beach areas to the mountain ranges. Some figures are clustered on outcrops on mountain ridges near ancient trails. These sites are often in arid areas and are not always connected to architectural structures or features. Unique site locations include: a large cliff face in Hanativa Valley, Fatu Hiva (Oilier n.d); a calcareous for- mation (beach rock) in a river mouth at Ha'atuatua beach, Nuku Hiva (Suggs 1961); a lava flow in Hatuana Valley, Ua Huka (Edwards 1985; Millerstrom 1985a); and up-lifted slabs of sandstone in Matatea Valley, Nuku Hiva (Millerstrom 1993). Carvings have been found on the walls of subterranean rectangular or circular pits and on domestic structures. In addition a high concentration of carvings have been documented among agricultural terraces in Hatiheu Valley, Nuku Hiva (Millerstrom 1994). Uninhabited densely fern-covered ridges were also used. After two recent fires (1989 and 1995) on the ridges above Hatiheu village several undocumented sites were exposed. The largest concentration of rock carvings, however, appears to be directly related to communal ceremonial complexes (tohua) and sacred structures (ahu or me'ae). In Hatiheu Valley the majority are located on individual outcrops or stones in close vicinity to the tohua and me'ae/ahu or on stones incorporated into raised plat- forms forming part of the tohua proper. But as the same types of carvings occur in both cere- monial and domestic context, it is clear that in the Marquesas the ritual value of the stone images was known to the general population rather than containing esoteric knowledge limited to the tribal chiefs or the priestly class. Their primary association with ceremonial complexes suggests that the images were related to ritual tribal functions linked with the chiefly establishment (discussed below). However, similar rituals, for example the rites surrounding birth and death, were probably also carried out in domestic contexts but on a smaller scale. Architectural context While a large amount of Marquesan rock art was placed on outcrops with no apparent spatial or temporal associa- tion, many of the images are incorporated with architec- ture of known cultural periods. Archaeologists (e.g. Suggs 1961; Kellum-Ottino 1971; Bellwood 1972; Ottino 1990) have defined and described three major types of Marquesan architectural complexes: 1) Raised stone house platforms (paepae) 2) Sacred structures (ahu/me'ae) and 3) Communal ceremonial complexes (tohua). The most prevalent Marquesas architectural structures are house platforms. Although there are great variations in form, size and attachments, typically a paepae is a one-terraced or two-terraced rectangular structure. Its sides are faced with roughly fitted boulders while the interior is filled with earth and rubble. The top surface consists of two parts; one paved with water-worn river stones (kiva) or irregular stones set in mud; the other half, the sleeping area, is mostly unpaved. A house of perishable material was constructed over the sleeping section. Most of the household activities took place on the paved open section. When carved images occur they are generally placed on the facing stones or on a series of cut stones (ke'etu) dividing the public platform (the paved part) and the private space (unpaved area) of the Marquesan house. Handy (1923) writes that large valleys often contained several related social units (mat'eina'a) each with their own public ceremonial center. A tohua, the domain of a hereditary tribal chief or in some cases a chiefess (Handy 1923; Linton 1925), consisted of a conglomerate of paepae, terraces, pavements, and enclosures surrounding a large rectangular unpaved dance area. All public func- tions related to the chief or chiefess and their family took place on the tohua. The death of an important chief, for instance, creating a great deal of social stress, was fol- lowed by a series of ritual activities, many of which took several years to complete (Handy 1923). Although the chief and his warriors lived in the vicin- ity of the ceremonial complex, they regularly occupied separate platforms within the tohua. In the southern Marquesan island group the warriors often had a separate structure or men's house (Linton 1925). During feasts (kohina), ritual activities were performed by the priests (tuhuna o'ono) in one end of the tohua, while musicians, dancers, guests of the chief etc., used the other platforms. Frequently large communal silos for the storage of fer- mented breadfruit (ma) was located nearby. In Hatiheu Valley most of the rock images appear to be linked with the communal ceremonial complex. Images were placed between stone structures, on the sur- face of platforms, on facing stones and on outcrops within the tohua proper or in close proximity of the com- plex. Linton (1925) distinguished between the public me 'ae linked to the tohua and separate mortuary me 'ae. Human sculptures are sometimes placed among the fac- ing stones of the me'ae in the tohua. Petroglyphs that occur on public me'ae are placed on the facing stones, on the surface of the front platform or in some cases around the upper part of stone-lined sunken pits. Images are also placed on large boulder incorporated into the public me'ae complex. Another noticeable feature associated with both types of me'ae is a large banyan tree growing on or near the platform. Some me'ae were tapu to the general population and thus greatly feared. While a chief resided over the tohua, the me'ae was the domain of the priestly establishment. Placement of motifs Based on the analysis of the Marquesan petroglyphs, the placement of motifs was linked to the uniqueness or nature of the stone. Thus a smooth rock surface was not necessarily a prerequisite for carving figures. Often 186</page><page sequence="7">rough rocks that appear unsuitable were pecked, while nearby rocks with smooth surfaces were left untouched. In some cases this could be due to the hardness of the rock - vesicular basalt is easier to work than fine grain basalt. Similarly, one large stone may have a small fig- ure carved in the corner of a panel while some stones have all panels filled with various figures. In Polynesia some rocks, because of their form, color, texture, or location were considered to be sacred and endowed with supernatural power or mana (Henry 1928:382; Handy 1927:181, 1930b:51), possibly becoming charged with mana once the images were completed. This power may have been manifested by a special event that took place. The carvings may have been made to ensure good crops, to appease the gods, or serve as a mnemonic device to recorded oral traditions and the history of the tribe. Natural cracks in stone pan- els that have been incorporated into the figure may sup- port the notion that certain stones were considered pow- erful and that mana was released from the stone once it was carved. Chronology Suggs opines that stick figures are the earliest form of rock art (1961). In the late 1950s he unearthed a gallery of anthropomorphic stick figures, dogs, fish, turtles, whales and circles pecked into the sandstone in a dry river mouth at Ha'atuatua beach, Nuku Hi va. Suggs argues that the rock art site was contemporary with a nearby excavated settlement dating back to 150 BC. Work in Hatiheu Valley tends to support Suggs' hypothe- sis that stick figures were the earliest form of stone images. Although the evidence for reused image stones is limited to 1.1% (25 images) in Hatiheu Valley, nonethe- less, the existing examples depict human stick figures only. In the case of superimposed images the earliest images are stick figures indicating that these type of fig- ures may be the earliest form of imagery in the islands. Archaeologically, the earliest relative date for a Marquesan stone image is derived from a stone Suggs uncovered in the lowest layer of a fire pit at Ha' ata' i ve' a, Nuku Hiva. A stone slab with a face was found in the lowest level. The valley was first occupied approxi- mately AD 1100 (Suggs 1961:66-67). A relative time depth indicator is the type of manufac- turing method used. Pecked, bruised, and pecked-and- abraded figures appears to be the earliest form of Polynesian carving methods (Lee 1992:27). Cox and Stasack (1970:61) argue that bas relief is the next "logi- cal step" in production because of the increasing elabora- tion. Following this reasoning, sculptures in the round, or tiki, may have been the next development. Frequently bas relief figures are so carved in the round they appears to be sculptured. Tiki were still made in the early part of the historic period circa 1840s (Linton 1925:167). However, some bas relief and sculptured images may have overlapped as they are often associated. In the absence of more direct evidence, I suggest the rock carv- ings of Hatiheu Valley were probably made after AD 1100 (Expansion Period) and continued to be made until about the time of European contact. The Eiaone paintings French Polynesia's only known rock paintings (pic- tographs) are located in six rock shelters on the eastern mountain ridge of Eiaone Valley, a narrow valley located on the north side of Hiva Oa (Millerstrom 1985b; Edwards and Millerstrom 1995). The smallest rock shel- ters measure from 5 to 8 meters in length, none are more than 2-5 meters deep. One rock shelter, measuring twenty-eight meters in length, contains the majority of the figures. Placed on the back wall are 110 anthropo- morphs, quadrupeds, marine animals and geometric fig- ures (Figure 5). Over time, the paint has impregnated the walls, and the figures have faded leaving only a light reddish stain. The rock shelters also contain six pecked anthropomorphic stick figures. While the painted figures are stylistically unique compared to the rest of the Marquesan rock images, the pecked anthropomorphic figures are identical to stick figures found throughout the archipelago. Dog motifs are a rare occurrence anywhere except on the north coast of Nuku Hiva. They are, however, found in the largest rock shelter at Eiaone (Figure 6). Dogs, chicken and pigs were the domestic species introduced to the islands with the initial Polynesian colonizers (Suggs 1961). Sinoto excavated two dog burials (Layer V, Area B) in Hane, Ua Huka (Sinoto 1979:119). However, dogs were omitted in George Forster's (1777) list of Marquesan food sources. Neither were there any refer- ences to dogs in the legends collected by Handy (1930a) and von den Steinen (Terrell 1988). This led Titcomb (1969:33) to speculate that dogs had died out by the time of western contact. It appears that dogs were never plen- tiful but archeological excavations indicate that in some areas dogs were present throughout the prehistoric sequence (Rolett 1989:161-162).

Geometric motifs dominate the Eiaone paintings com- prising 45.5%. Anthropomorphs make up 18.2% of the figures (Table 2). The paintings are stylistically similar to each other. It is likely that the rock shelters were only visited periodically and that the paintings were made over a short time period possibly by the same person. It is possible that the narrow valley with the rock shel- ters had a sacred rather than a secular function in the pre- historic era. Except for some polished spots on the floor, probably from sharpening stone tools, no visible evi- dence suggests that the rock shelters were ever occupied on a permanent basis. With uneven and slanted stone floors (approximately 30°) and exposure to the elements, the shelters would not have been ideal living places. Banyan trees, which were considered special and often located near sacred places, grow on the steep slopes directly outside the shelters. Situated on a steep moun- tain slope approximately 200 m above the valley floor, the rock shelters are isolated and difficult to reach. At the outer edges of the rock shelters the mountainside falls sharply into the valley below. A sweeping view from above includes the ocean, the valley with the narrow bay below as well as several mountain ridges. The choice of reddish pigment also suggests ritual value since red was a sacred color and was associated with high status and mana throughout Polynesia (e.g. Handy 1927; Burrows 1938; Firth 1967; Lee 1992; Tilburg 1994). Approximately 80% of the architectural remains on the valley floor of Eiaone have been mapped (Edwards pers. comm. 1985). Field surveys suggest that the lower part of the valley floor contained mostly ceremonial structures rather than domestic habitation. Subterranean storage pits for fermented breadfruit, common around domestic sites, are absent in the lower part of Eiaone Valley. Many of the architectural structures, especially at the head of the valley, have carved images placed on stones forming part of the house platforms. Further research is certainly needed. For example, the age of the paintings, the tools used, and the composition of the red pigment remain unknown. Unfortunately after a tragic accident in the valley it was declared tapu by the owner and at the present time no one is allowed on the property. Hatiheu Valley, Nuku Hiva Hatiheu Valley has an especially rich prehistoric rock carving tradition. The rock images are typical of the images throughout the archipelago and provide an excel- lent sample to examine closely. As of 1990 the carvings in Hatiheu alone totalled 2256 individual motifs representing some 360 different stones or boulders (Table 3). Rock art sites are distributed throughout the valley, but the majority 189</page><page sequence="10">Figure 8. Hatiheu Valley. Numeric distribution of images of the sites are located on the eastern side; while fourteen sites were recorded in the western half of the valley, twenty-seven sites were recorded in the eastern section (Figure 7). The number of individual images appears to be evenly distributed between both the eastern and the west- ern side of the valley (Figure 8). Frequently the images were placed on rectangular or square shaped stones incor- porated into architectural structures. Most pecked images, however, occur on large natural outcrops and are found scattered around ceremonial complexes, house founda- tions, old trails, along riverbanks and on ridges. In Hatiheu Valley 3 1 .6% of the images face directly north and another 4.8% face in a northern direction (Table 4). In Hatiheu the northern direction points towards the ocean. The southern direction (16%), towards the mountain, is less distinct. However, the strong seaward orientation is culturally significant and accords with the fundamental principles of ancestral Polynesian notion of sacred and secular spatial organiza- tion (Firth 1936; Ottino 1990; Kirch 1996). Firth's ethno- graphic accounts, for instance, relate how the Tikopia indigenous houses were spatially structured. The sacred part of the houses faced the beach and the ocean. Men occupied the sacred side of the house. Ancestors were buried beneath the floor; ritual and sacred paraphernalia were stored in the rafters. The opposite section, the secu- lar part of the house, had female association. This orga- nization of Tikopia social space was still in place in 1977 (Kirch 1996). Test excavation of two house sites by Kirch and Yen at Tuakamali in Faea (Site TK-20) suggests that the essential sacred/secular distinction dates back to at least AD 1400-1800 (Kirch and Yen 1982:126-131). Ottino (1990) examining the symbolic spatial separation of the Marquesan domestic structure suggested that the sacred (the sleeping area) versus the public part (front platform) of the house foundation is an ancient custom. However, regarding the orientation of the rock art panels it is presently unknown if rock art panels in other valleys depict the same seaward/mountain dichotomy. Some of the carved stones have been found hidden in the foundations of architectural structures. In Hatiheu these 190</page><page sequence="11">figures depict anthropomorphic stick figures and geometric motifs suggesting that these motif types are the earliest form of stone imagery. Geometric motifs constitute the main individual motif category in the valley (Table 3). Image classification Image image types (n) types (%) I. ANTHROPOMORPHS 668* 29.6 1.

Orientation of rock images in Hatiheu Valley Four stone sculptures have been located in Hatiheu Valley. Three tiki are still in situ at tohua Hikokua. The sculptures are inserted in the wall of the tuu (sacrificial platform) between cut rectangular slabs of red tuff. Another small sculpture found in 1988 lying on the dance floor at tohua Kamuihei has now been moved to the stone garden at Hinakonui restaurant in the center of the contemporary village. Undoubtedly the ceremonial complexes contained a larger number of stone and wood sculptures than we presently have evidence for. Since the early part of the western contact period these objects were hidden by the islanders or they were sold to visitors. Frequently sculp- tures were simply removed from their sacred places and ended up in private homes or museums worldwide. Imagery within the cultural context The power of stones While all worked or unworked stones in Polynesia were embodied with mana (Handy 1927; Burrows 1938), some stones were believed to be more powerful or sacred than others. Stones, like all things in nature, were believed to grow in the same manner as people and plants. Linton wrote that the islanders believed that cut slabs of red tuff (ke'etu) "... grows slowly but constantly - a quality peculiar to it" (Linton 1925:165). In fact, stone carving was so important that certain rituals were observed while quarrying. Workers believed that they had to avoid women prior to working with stone or their stone tools would break (Linton 1925:165). The notion that some stones were considered special can be inferred from the manner in which the carver selected stones for image making and in the way the carver incorporated natural lines and bulges in the stones. In some instances it appears that the carver had interpreted a particular bulge in the stone as an image and modified it to make a conventional bas relief figure as if to "liberate" the image from the stone. The same technique is noted in Paleolithic art (Conkey 1981:27) and in Easter Island rock art (Lee 1986:33). It is clear from our work that certain stones were chosen over oth- ers according to specific cultural rules. That particular stones were selected over others for their power is not a unique Marquesan cultural phenom- ena. Henry wrote that in Tahiti "Stone was possessed with godly power" (1928:382). It is also significant that the Polynesian term papa (stone) translates as throne in Tahitian (Handy 1930b:35). Lee (1992:124), for instance, opines that petroglyphs placed on selected Easter Island sculptures (moai) are linked to the mana of the stones. Cultural context Lexical reconstruction of named tattoo motifs which cor- respond to rock art motifs implies that some rock image types may have some antiquity (Millerstrom and Allen 1994). Mata, mata komoe, ipu, and atua/etua are a few of the numerous tattoo names given to Karl von den Steinen (1925, 1928a, 1928b) by Marquesan informants in 1887. These same terms are still used today to describe certain rock art motifs. *Mata, a Proto- Polynesian taxeme refers to eye and face (Walsh and Biggs 1966). The word has the same use in Easter Island, Tonga, Samoa, the Cooks and among the Maori (Walsh and Biggs 1966). Maka is a Hawaiian cognate. Other glosses for mata includes 'genealogy' (Handy 1923; Dordillion 1931), 'clan' (Routledge 1919), 'tribe' (Metraux 1940:120), or 'status lineage' (Goldman 1970:119). *Ipu can mean 'calabash' and 'container' (Walsh and Biggs 1966). Atua or etua is translated as 'deity' (Walsh and Biggs 1966), 'god', or 'spirit' 191</page><page sequence="12">(Steinen 1925; Handy 1923). These words are still retained in Polynesian dialects (Walsh and Biggs 1966) indicating that some motif types are connected with con- cepts that go far back in prehistory (Millerstrom and Allen 1994). It is useful to examine the imagery within a theoretical framework which DeBoer (1991) has glossed as perva- sive versus partitive decorative organization. The two opposing art systems derive from DeBoer's work among the Shipibo (located in the tropical forest of the central Ucayali basin in the Peruvian Amazon), and the Chachi (located in the northernmost coast of Ecuador) in South America. A pervasive decorative style exhibits distinct attrib- utes in most media, which in the Shipibo case was emphasized in pottery, textiles, face and body painting, calabashes, house posts, canoes and canoe paddles and so forth. A decorative style expressed on the surface of different media identify and may furthermore represent the ideology of a specific culture or group of people. A society agrees on the ideology by unconsciously partici- pating in it. Partitive art systems, on the other hand, display no uniform decorative organization in the different media. Instead they have a number of decorative modes, each which are exhibited in different material objects. DeBoer argued that the partitive decorative organization . . . experience a much higher rate of change. [Because the] ... decorative organization displays weak linkages across various artifactual media, any one medium is freer to change without threatening massive, across-the-board readjustments (1991 : 157). Among some social groups the distinction is over- lapped or blurred. A group which features a partative decorative organization may also have some features which are pervasive. DeBoer's theoretical perspective has important impli- cations regarding changes in the Marquesan art system and how these changes reflect social transformation. Generally Polynesian decorative systems are pervasive, especially in West Polynesia (Green 1979). The Marquesan art system, however, is remarkably pervasive compared to that of other Polynesian islands or island- groups. For instance, Burrows, found that human images were more often depicted on all Marquesan media (e.g. houses, canoes, implements, and ornaments) that on the same media in the other Polynesian islands or island- groups (Burrows 1938:41; table 1). In a similar study Greiner (1923) demonstrated that numerically the distri- butions of design elements and motifs used in carving occurred in more Marquesan media than in the islands of Hawaii, Tahiti, Austral, Cook, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand. Unfortunately, Greiner did not have the opportunity to examine Steinen's (1925, 1928ab) seminal work on Marquesan material art. His work would have bolstered Greiner 's argument. Tattoo motifs and material objects, such as wooden clubs, bone fan handles, decorated turtle shell, stone pounders, etc. collected in the early historic period, show remarkable similarities in their decorative systems. Stolpe (1927) suggested that the Polynesian images were probably primarily symbolic before they became decora- tive. Nonetheless, the similarities seen in Marquesan rock art, tattoos and material objects suggests that the principles regarding the symbolic order remained funda- mentally unchanged. Collective ideology, venerated ancestors and tribal insignia The first Marquesas settlers, possibly arriving as early as 150 BC (Suggs 1961; Kirch 1982, 1986; cf. Sinoto 1966; Spriggs and Anderson 1993), brought with them a men- tal template of the images, a repertoire of standardized figures put to use for certain occasions. Carved figures on rocks are present in most of the Polynesian islands, some of which are associated with early settlements. While firm dates are still lacking in the Marquesas, I expect the carving practice to be an early cultural expres- sion which continued into the late prehistoric period. Suggs argued that not all the cultural motifs may have been applied to stones but that "... all the basic motifs were always present in other media" (Suggs 1961:151). Furthermore, Suggs believed that different processes or modification in motif development may have occurred in stone carvings and other media. The Marquesan stone image repertoire is relatively limited in motif types, homogeneous and repetitive, sug- gesting that the Marquesan imagery depicted a collective cultural ideology expressing certain social values. While it is questionable if every segment of the population shared the same ideology, many participated in it con- sciously or unconsciously. The same image types seen in ceremonial complexes also occur at some domestic house sites and agricultural terraces. Giddens (1979) argues that only the ruling class are strongly committed to a dominant ideology. However, the images' primary association with the tribal ceremonial places suggests that they are linked to the activities of the ruling class. Maintenance of group solidarity is manifested in occa- sional collective expression that usually takes on ritual form (Radcliffe-Brown 1952). All rituals require some form of concrete object or objects which then serve as an agency of social control (Radcliffe-Brown 1952). In the Marquesas the images' visibility to or in close vicinity of the dominant center of all political and social tribal activ- ities may have served as permanent reminders to the inhabitants on the social order within the community. Thus the images were part of rites designed to promote and reinforce social solidarity in order to maintain a belief system that bolstered the political position of the hereditary chief, priests or warriors - those that main- tained a permanent place within the tohua. However, in the late prehistoric and early historic period it is clear that human images in the form of sculp- tures, a continuation of the petroglyph tradition, were 192</page><page sequence="13">made for the elite. Size of sculptures, intricate workman- ship, and sacred red colored stones were emphasized symbolizing rank and status (Suggs 1961). Symbolic images on stones were transformed over time to sculp- tures some which became architectural embellishment. Thus while style and material changed the basic concept remained (discussed below). Image making may have been a way to honor and venerate ancestors. The Polynesians' concern with genealogy (mata) was strong. Genealogy linked them with their ancestors and defined their social position to their chief. Genealogies were chanted in rites of adop- tion, birth of first born, marriages, funerals, etc. (Handy 1923:341-346, 1930b: 11). Because the head were con- sidered the seat of mana, ancestral skulls were frequently removed from burials and treated as sacred relics (Suggs 1961:168; Handy 1923, 1930b). Ivory (1990) suggests that the concepts of mata and ipu terms linked to images in rock art, in tattoo, material objects are metaphorically connected to . . . face, eye, skull, gourd, fish, turtle, ray, hair, and belly, and that all of these in turn were associated with the atua and the spirit world, and that visually, these could be encapsulated in representations of circular motifs in gen- eral, and the face, skull, and eyes, in particular (Ivory 1990:13-14). Images may have served as visual markers to identify clan members and may thus have linked families to their ancestral lands. Tautain wrote that after the death of an important person a carving was made on stones or trees that represented the deceased's facial tattoos (1897:675). This statement suggests that some of the images were related to a specific person probably a chief, priest or warrior. It also indicates that images were linked with tattooing practices and that they were associated with funeral rites. Although no traces of tree carvings have been found, Tautain's comment suggests that both living trees and stones served as media. It seems likely that certain motif types belonged to or were associated with specific related tribes or ramages. Torrey, shipwrecked on Tahuata in 1835, relates in his personal narrative that each different group wore tribal tattoo marks on their face, breast or hands, etc. To join the Teheda tribe and go to war against an enemy tribe the back of Torrey's hand was tattooed "to bear the king's mark" (Torrey 1848:125-7). He was thus "considered as the king's own private property subject entirely to his control and disposition" and could never desert (Torrey 1848:126). Motif types on stones and their spatial distribution shows considerable local variation. For instance, of the five known tribal ceremonial complexes in Hatiheu Valley, tohua Nanauhi contains no images whereas at tohua Maikuku the primary motif type are dogs and anthropomorphic faces. At tohua Kamuihei, tohua Hikokua and tohua Tahakia, three ceremonial complexes located in close proximity of each other, anthropomorphic stick figures appear to dominate. While the significance of the motif distribution is unknown it does suggests that certain image types were linked to specific communal ceremonial complexes and thus the related tribe. Sociopolitical changes The time-period before AD 1 100 is the least known part of the Marquesan cultural history. Only a few sites from the early settlement period have been excavated (Suggs 1961; Sinoto 1966) and the reported carbon dates are controversial (Kirch 1986; Spriggs and Anderson 1993). The majority of excavated sites occur approxi- mately from AD 1100 and onwards. Changes in the social and political system occurred in the Expansion Period from approximately AD 1100 (Suggs 1961). This is reflected both in the rock art and in architecture. During this time population increased and people gravi- tated inland from the beach. This settlement trend con- tinued in the Classic Period (about AD 1400 to the Christian era circa 1790). In this period environmen- tally marginal lands became occupied. Warfare and rivalry, probably resulting from a combination of demo- graphic increase, land degradation, prolonged drought, and depletion of resources typifies the late prehistoric and early historic period (Kirch 1990). Monumental architecture and megalithic sculpture suggests a grow- ing concern with status and prestige (Suggs 1961). From a basic traditional Polynesian system of ascribed status as discussed by Goldman (1970), Marquesan cul- ture had changed to one in which status among warriors and priests was increasingly achieved (Suggs 1961:186; Kirch 1990; Thomas 1990). It was noted by early Western visitors to the islands that stone and wood sculptures depicted deified impor- tant ancestors (Tautain 1897; Delmas 1886; Handy 1923; Linton 1925), and some sculptures were carved to embellish houses (Linton 1925). Thus the traditional belief system that was symbolized by the pecked human figures on flat surfaces was transferred to sculptures in the round. Whereas the method of manufacture changed over time stylistic attributes were generally retained. Large eyes and a wide mouth, for instance, characterize anthropomorphic faces both in petroglyphs and sculp- tures throughout the islands. While the general underly- ing ideological concept brought with the early settlers survived for several hundred years, a socio-political transformation occurred in the late prehistoric period that reflected status and intertribal rivalry Image comparisons in Polynesia Since the early 1980s, rock images have been docu- mented in several French Polynesian islands by archaeol- ogists with C.P.S.H., Tahiti. Combined with previously documented rock images a large corpus of documented rock images now exist from the Society Islands: Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, Huahine, Raiatea (Inventaire 193</page><page sequence="14">Archéologique de Polynésie Française 1989), and Maupiti (Emory 1933); from the Australs; Tubuai (Candelot 1980; Millerstrom 1991), Raivavae; (Marshall 1957; Millerstrom 1991), Rapa (Smith 1965); and from the Marquesas Islands (Edwards 1989; Millerstrom 1985a, b, 1988, 1989a, 1990, 1992). Elsewhere in Polynesia rock images have been extensively recorded on Easter Island (Metraux 1937, 1940; Lavachery 1939; Lee 1986, 1990, 1992, 1993), and the Hawaiian Islands (Emory 1924; Cox and Stasack 1970; Lee 1989, 1990-1991, 1995 and Georgia Lee pers. comm. 1994-95). Similarly, research in New Zealand has been comprehensive (e.g. Trotter and McCulloch 1971). Both from the South and North islands several hundred sites are known. The only known site on Pitcairn depicts one anthropomorph and several geometric figures carved on the wall at Down-rope (Lavachery 1936). Information concerning rock images from the Fiji- Samoa-Tonga region and westward is limited. Only two different motif elements such as turtles and geometric circles have been documented from three sites on American Samoa (Kikuchi 1964, 1967). Linear motifs are reported from 4 royal tombs (langi) in Tonga (McKern 1929:79). Recently, Burley (1994) discovered one carved foot motif (right plantar view) on a stone forming part of the royal tomb of Mala' e Lahi, on 'Uiha island, located in the northern part of the Ha'apai island group. Rock images are present in Fiji, apparently in large numbers, but the publications are short and sketchy (Vogan 1937; Phillipps 1951; O'Reilly 1954; Palmer and Clunie 1970; cf. Ewins 1995). None have been reported from the Tuamotus and the Cook archipelagos. While distribution, cultural meaning, and associated structures and features vary both in time and space, the mental template of the stone imagery had a common Polynesian ancestral cultural heritage. The widespread distribution of stylistically homogeneous imagery in the Marquesan and other East Polynesian islands, especially the Hawaiian archipelago, testify to this. Although rock images from the various islands or island groups have not been systematically examined, except for the Marquesas, Easter Island, New Zealand and the Hawaiian Islands, commonalties in most of the motif types occur. Marquesas anthropomorphic face motifs (mata komoe) are stylistically similar to those of Easter Island. A couple have also been recorded in Hawaii by G. Lee and myself (Bahn and Flenley 1992:61. Figures 37-39). Moreover, both in the Marquesas and in Easter Island these images are frequently clustered on the same stone. In addition face images are often pecked on the edges of the stones which give them a three dimensional look. However, whereas anthropomorphic stick figures are numerous in the Marquesas and Hawaiian Islands, strangely enough, they do not occur in Easter Island (Lee 1992). Nonetheless, turtles, although nowhere as com- mon as in Raiatea (Inventaire Archéologique de Polynésie Française 1989), are part of the repertoire in most of the islands or island groups (e.g. Lee 1986; Rolett 1989; Millerstrom 1990, 1992). Whereas stone images are less common in West Polynesia they appears in great numbers in East Polynesia. There are several conceivable but unsup- ported explanations for this. 1 ) The presence of rock art has not been systematically examined in West Polynesia. 2) In west Polynesia images were displayed on perish- able material rather than on stones. 3) In West Polynesia the images were sacred and part of an esoteric knowl- edge among the ruling class. Over time the motifs may have become more mundane as the early colonizers brought the tradition with them eastwards. Conclusion Rock art, the least understood part of the Marquesan archeological record, had multiple social meanings and functions some of which have been interpreted from recent survey-generated data. Since 1984 rock images have been intensively documented and a large corpus of data now exist for analysis. Generally, the repertoire demonstrates that the motif types are relatively limited, homogeneous, and repetitive throughout the archipelago, despite considerable local variation in frequency and spatial distribution. Fundamentally the images can be seen as representing a collective ideology that was prin- cipally concerned with genealogy and ancestral venera- tion. Serving as a visual reminder, rock imagery pro- moted and supported tribal solidarity. Enforcing communal solidarity was an ideology that was of partic- ular interest to the ruling class, causing inter-tribal con- flicts which often resulted in socio-political changes. Some stone images probably represented clan markers, crop gods, and boundary markers. Ultimately, all images aided in establishing ties to ancestral lands.
