<plain_text><page sequence="1">'God Created Adam in His Image' Christopher Melchert University of Oxford Well-attested hadlth reports tell us that God created Adam 'in His image'. In one form, the hadlth report stops here; in other forms, reported more often, it goes on to describe his giant stature (60 cubits) or it is offered in explanation of why one must not strike someone's face (alternatively, insult it). The connection with striking the face hardly makes sense unless the transmitters of this version thought that Adam was created in God's image, so that striking the face was tantamount to striking God. The interpretation of this declaration was the subject of some controversy in the mid third/ninth century, as Ahmad b. Hanbal and his followers insisted that it be interpreted in its obvious sense, without anti-anthropomorphic intellectualising, whereas others, notably the Baghdadi jurisprudent Abü Thawr, explained that 'in his image' ( calã suratihï) meant only 'in Adam's image'. The secondary literature says surprisingly little on this controversy. Several articles on Adam in the Islamic tradition and even a book say nothing about it.1 M.J. Kister does furnish us with a short account of the theological debate, Daniel Gimaret a much fuller.2 Gimaret lists four hadlth reports (none from the Six Books, oddly) mentioning that God created Adam 'in His image', then reviews the anti-anthropomorphic explanations of various theologians. He endorses that of Ibn Fürak (d. 406/1015-16), the Nlshäpüri Ashcarï, which he says applies equally well to the Book of Genesis: that this means He created Adam with such traits as reason that distinguish man from the animals. I have nothing to add concerning that later debate.3 I do think that there is more to be said both about hadlth reports on the subject and the early theological controversy. The principal reason earlier students have said so little is their assumption that tafslr is the genre in which such things are discussed. But the earliest discussions of many issues are better documented from the literature of law ifiqh) and hadlth. It is the latter that will occupy my presentation.

Juynboll's terminology 4 main clusters', meaning similar texts with variant chains of authorities.4 The first is related by al-Bukhãrl in the first section of the Book of istťdhán ('asking permission to enter'), on the origin of the salutation al-salãm calaykum : &lt; Yahyã b. Jacfar (Transoxanian, d. 243/858) &lt; cAbd al-Razzãq (Yemeni, d. 211/ 827) &lt; Mac mar (Basran, moved to Yemen, d. 153/770?) &lt; Hammãm b. Munabbih (Yemeni, d. 131/748-9?) &lt; AbO Hurayra &lt; the Prophet:5 God . . . created Adam in His image. His height was 60 cubits. When He had created him, He said to him, 'Go and salute that group,' meaning a group of angels sitting, 'and listen to how they answer you, for it will be your salutation and the salutation of your seed.' So he went and said, 'Peace be upon you.' They said, 'Peace be upon you and the mercy of God.' They added 'the mercy of God.' Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the image of Adam. Men have not ceased to be shorter until now. The first sentence recalls Gen. 1:27, 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them'.6 As a hadlth report, it has good confirmation back at least to cAbd al-Razzãq, for the same report appears in his Musannaf and is also related directly from him in Ahmad's Musnad , indirectly in Muslim's Sahlh.7 Oddly, however, al-Bukhãrl relates the same text in the first section of the Book of the Prophets, on the creation of Adam, with a difference: &lt; cAbd Allah b. Muhammad (Transoxanian, d. 229/844) &lt; cAbd al-Razzãq and so on, this time beginning, 'God ... created Adam with a height of 60 cubits'. More on this to come. There are several isolated reports ( akhbãr al-ãhãd, corresponding roughly to 'single strands' in Juynboll's terminology) to the same effect. Ahmad b. Hanbal is quoted as relating &lt; Abu cÃmir (Basran, d. 204/819-20?) &lt; al-Mughlra b. cAbd al-Rahmãn (Medinese, lived in Ashkelon) &lt; Abu'1-Zinãd (Medinese, d. 130/748?) &lt; Mõsã b. Abl cUthmãn (Medinese or Kufan, fl. early second/eighth century) &lt; his father &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Prophet: 'God ... created Adam in His image', with the comment from Ahmad's son, 'in my father's book [were the words] "his height being 60 cubits", but I do not know whether he related that to me or not'.8 Similarly, cAbd Allãh b. Ahmad relates not from his father but &lt; Abu Bakr al-Saghãnl (Khurãsãnl, lived in Baghdad, d. 270/883) &lt; CA1I b. al-Hasan b. Shaqlq (Basran, moved to Khurãsãn, d. 215/830-1?) &lt; cAbd Allãh b. al-Mubãrak (Khurãsãnl, d. 181/797) &lt; Usãma b. Zayd (Medinese, d. 153/770) &lt; SacId al-Maqburi (Medinese, d. 123/ 740-1?) &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God 'that God created Adam in His image'.9 The names Abü'1-Zinäd in the first and SacTd al-Maqburl in the second suggest that these are actually truncated versions of the second main cluster. Ahmad's</page><page sequence="3">'God Created Adam in His Image' 1 15 apparent hesitation to describe his height suggests that he, also, thought this isnãd did not belong with the first matn cluster. Because all our credible versions go through cAbd al-Razzãq, Juynboll identifies him as the common link and inventor of the hadith report about the salutation.10 The second great matn cluster on this topic may be illustrated by a version that Muslim relates in the Book of al-birr ('piety'), part of a series of hadith reports (section titles were added to his work only by later editors) against striking the face: &lt; Nasr b. c All al-Jahdami (Basran, d. 250/864?) &lt; his father &lt; al-Muthannã (b. Sacd or SacId, Basran, fl. mid second/eighth cent.) and &lt; Muhammad b. Hãtim (Baghdadi, d. 249/863) &lt; cAbd al-Rahmãn b. Mahdl (Basran, d. 198/814) &lt; al- Muthannã b. SacId &lt; Qatãda (Basran, d. 118/736-7?) &lt; Abü Ayyüb (Basran, d. с. 90/708-9) &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God: 'When one of you fights his brother, let him avoid the face, for God created Adam in His image.'11 This is confirmed by Ahmad' s Musnad , which relates the same directly of cAbd al-Rahmãn b. Mahdl.12 This matn cluster recalls a later verse in Genesis: 'Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man'.13 Attacking a person is like attacking God. However, Ahmad also relates at the same place a shorter version with a parallel chain of transmitters: &lt; Bahz (b. Asad, Basran, d. after 200/815-16?) &lt; Hammãm (b. Yahyã, Basran, d. 164/ 781?) &lt; Qatãda &lt; Abü Ayyöb &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; Messenger of God: 'when one of you fights his brother, let him avoid the face', omitting the explanation 'for God created Adam in His image.' Indeed, there are many parallel versions of this report with and without the explanation. Ahmad relates &lt; Sulaymãn b. Dãwud (Abü Dãwud al-TayälisI, Basran, d. 203/818-19?) &lt; al-Muthannã &lt; Qatãda &lt; Abü Ayyüb &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Prophet: 'When one of you fights [someone], let him beware (yattaqi ) the face, for God ... created Adam in His image.'14 The same isnãd appears in Abü Däwüd al-Tayãlisí's own Musnad (but actually compiled late in the third/ninth century) with only the first phrase 'when one of you fights [someone], let him beware the face'.15 The Basran Abü Bakr b. Abl cÃsim al-Nabïl (d. Isfahan, 287/ 900?) relates &lt; Muhammad b. Thacla-ba b. Sawã3 (Basran, fl . earlier third/ninth century) &lt; his paternal uncle Muhammad b. Sawã3 &lt; Sacïd b. Abï cArüba (Basran, d. 156/772-3?) &lt; Qatãda &lt; Abü Rãfic &lt; the Messenger of God: 'When one of you fights, let him avoid the face, for God (be He exalted) created Adam in the image of His face.'16 Qatãda' s presence shows that this is the same hadith report, although the aberrant branching out to Abü Rãfic before him instead of Abü Ayyüb seems worrisome. Likewise, Muslim relates at the same place a number of versions with only the prohibition of striking the face: &lt; cUbayd Allãh b. Mucãdh al-cAnbari (Basran, d. 237/851-2) &lt; his father &lt; his father &lt; Shucba (WãsitI, active in Basra, d. 160/776-7) &lt; Qatãda &lt; Abü Ayyüb &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of</page><page sequence="4">1 16 Journal of Qur'anic Studies God: 'When one of you fights his brother, let him most certainly not hit (lã yaltimanna) the face'; also &lt; Muhammad b. al-Muthannã (Baghdadi, d. 252/ 866?) &lt; cAbd al-Samad (Basran, d. 206/821-2?) &lt; Hammãm &lt; Qatãda &lt; Yahyã b. Mãlik al-Marãgh! (i.e. Abü Ayyüb) &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God: 'When one of you fights his brother, let him avoid the face.'17 Al-BukhãrT relates two uncorroborated versions, one of which appears to substitute the authorities supporting the hadïîh report about the salutation for the one normally associated with fighting: &lt; Muhammad b. cUbayd Allah (Medinese, d. 227/841) &lt; Ibn Wahb (Egyptian, d. 197/813) &lt; Mãlik b. Anas (Medinese, d. 179/795) &lt; anonymous &lt; SacId al-Maqburi &lt; his father &lt; Abü Hurayra, also &lt; cAbd Allah b. Muhammad (the Transoxanian, again) &lt; cAbd al- Razzãq &lt; Macmar &lt; Hammãm &lt; Abu Hurayra: 'When one of you fights, let him avoid the face.'18 Sometimes instead of Qatãda we have АЬй'1-Zinãd and al-Acraj, thus giving us a Medinese isnãd instead of a Basran. Ahmad relates this &lt; Sufyãn (b. cUyayna, Kufan, transferred to Mecca, d. 198/814) &lt; АЬй'1-Zinãd &lt; al-Acraj (cAbd al- Rahmãn b. Hurmuz, Medinese, d. 117/735-6) &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Prophet: 'If one of you strikes [someone], let him avoid the face, for God created Adam in His image.'19 But Muslim relates two versions without the explanation: &lt; cAbd Allãh b. Maslama b. Qacnab (Medinese, lived in Basra, d. Mecca, 221/835-6?) &lt; al- Mughlra (b. cAbd al-Rahmãn), meaning al-Hizãml (Medinese, /7. later second/eighth century) &lt; АЬй'1-Zinãd &lt; al-Acraj &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God: 'When one of you fights his brother, let him avoid the face'; then &lt; cAmr al-Nãqid (Baghdadi, active in Mesopotamia, d. 232/846-7) and Zuhayr b. Harb (Baghdadi, d. 234/848-9) &lt; Sufyãn b. cUyayna &lt; Abü'1-Zinäd: 'When one of you strikes'.20 Abu Däwüd relates a completely uncorroborated version through the Medinese cUmar b. Abí Salama (d. 132/750?).21 There is also a variant in which insulting someone's face is the issue instead of or in addition to striking it. Ahmad relates this &lt; Yahyã b. SacTd (Basran, d. 198/ 813-14) &lt; (Muhammad) Ibn cAjlãn (Medinese, d. 148/765-6?) &lt; SacTd (b. al- Musay y ab, Medinese, d. 94/712-13?) &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Prophet: 'If one of you strikes [someone], let him avoid the face. Let him not say, "May God make far your face and anyone's face that resembles yours", for God created Adam in His image.'22 Al-Nasã°I reports something similar but &lt; Ibn cAjlãn &lt; his father (not SacId b. al-Musayyab) &lt; Abu Hurayra.23 Ibn Abí Ãsim relates something similar through yet another shaykh before Ibn c Ajlãn, &lt; Muhammad b. al-Musaffã (Himsl, d. Mecca, 246/860-1) &lt; cUthmãn b. SacId (Himsl, d. 209/824-5?) &lt; al-Layth b. Sacd (Egyptian, d. 175/791) &lt; Muhammad b. c Ajlãn &lt; SacTd b. Abl SacId al-Maqburi (Medinese, d. 126/794?) &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God: 'Let no one say to one of you, "May God make ugly your face and any face that resembles yours,"</page><page sequence="5">'God Created Adam in His Image' 117 for God created Adam in his image.'24 Al-Bukhäri relates something similar in al-Adab al-mufrad , no. 173 &lt; cAbd Allah b. Muhammad &lt; Ibn cUyayna &lt; Ibn cAjlãn &lt; SacId (whether Ibn al-Musayyab or al-Maqburi is not specified) &lt; Abu Hurayra: 'Never say, "May God make ugly your face and that of anyone who resembles you," for God created Adam in His image.'25 In the same book, however, he also relates versions without the explanation: &lt; Hajjãj (b. al-Minhäl, Baghdadi, d. 217/832) &lt; Ibn cUyayna &lt; Ibn cAjlän &lt; SacId &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; Prophet: 'Do not say "May God make ugly his face'"; &lt; Muhammad b. Khãlid (a mysterious figure cited only by al-Bukhãri) &lt; Sulaymän b. Bilãl (Medinese, d. 177/ 793^?) &lt; Muhammad b. cAjlãn &lt; his father and Sacïd &lt; Abu Hurayra &lt; the Prophet: 'When one of you strikes his servant, let him avoid the face.'26 Ibn cAjlãn is plainly the distinguishing mark of this variant. (An exception is a pair of hadïth reports related by Ibn Abï cÃsim going back to the Prophet through Ibn cUmar by a mainly Kufan isnãd. More on this pair below.) Which set of hadïth reports is more reliable, the set with or the set without God's creating Adam in His image? I strongly favour the view that the version with Adam in God's image is authentic, at least as far back as the mid second/eighth century and probably the early part of it. In the case of the cAbd al-Razzãq cluster, it is very clear that the version with Adam in God's image is original, the version without an abridgement, for we have multiple witnesses to cAbd al-Razzãq' s transmitting it that way, including even al-Bukhãri himself in one version. It is more difficult to be sure with the other cluster, but several considerations make me favour the version with Adam in God's image. First, as I have said, it makes good sense. Secondly, it has the Biblical echo in its favour. Thirdly, it is considerably less convenient to later orthodoxy and therefore presumptively, given how widely attested it is, not a back projection, or at least not from the mid third/ninth century. I would adduce the analogy of textual criticism. Confronted with two manuscripts otherwise equally authoritative (neither apparently closer to the autograph), one of which uses an obscure word, the other a familiar, textual critics have since the eighteenth century preferred the lectio difficilior , the more difficult reading, which is to say the obscure word. They suppose that a scribe is more likely to change an obscure word into a familiar than a familiar into an obscure. In the same way, it seems to me, a traditionist uncomfortable with the apparent anthropomorphism of our hadïth report (and al-Bukhãri and Muslim are both examples of traditionists who adhered in theology to the middle, semi- rationalist party rather than the extreme traditionalist party of their day) would prefer a version without the explanation about Adam's creation in the image of God. (It is true that if one manuscript offers a longer version of a passage than the other, textual critics have also since the eighteenth century preferred the shorter, supposing that copyists are more likely to add explanations than subtract them. In the case of our hadïth against striking the face, I have preferred the longer text, which goes against</page><page sequence="6">118 Journal of Qur'anic Studies this second rule. But here we are dealing with an explanation our reporters tended to dislike.) Our documentation of the controversy over this hadïth report is scanty, and comes mostly from hostile sources. In the Ibãdi tradition, Muqãtil b. Sulaymãn (Khurãsãní, d. 150/767-8) is credited with saying that God created Adam in His image. He was corrected by AbO cUbayda (d. c. 2 10/825-6). 27 Ahmad b. Hanbal was upset with Abu Thawr (d. Baghdad, 240/854) over the interpretation of this hadïth report. Someone reported to Ahmad that Abu Thawr had explained 'God created Adam in his own image' by interpreting the pronoun suffix as going back to Adam, not God. Ahmad lowered his head for a long time, then struck his hand against his face and said, This is bad talk. This is the talk of Jahm. This is a Jahml: do not go near him.'28 The Hanãbila identified the doctrine of the created Qur'an with Jahm b. Safwãn. Someone else reported that Ahmad had said, The matter is clearly against AbO Thawr. Whoever says that God created Adam in the image of Adam is a Jahml. What image had Adam before He created him?'29 Ahmad' s close follower cAbd al-Wahhãb (d. Baghdad, 251/865?) reported that Abü Thawr had said, 'God created Adam in his image', then explained, 'He is only in the image of Adam, not in the image of the Most Merciful (i al-rahmãn ).'30 Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) quotes the hadïth report without isnãd : 'God (mighty and glorious is He) created Adam in His image.' He was aware of theologians ( ashãb al-kalãm ) who said that this meant only that He created Adam in Adam's image. Ibn Qutayba reasonably objects that this interpretation reduces the saying to inanity (' law kãna al-murãd hãdhã mã kãna fi'l-kalãm fã1 ida ').31 Indeed, explanations having to do with the referent of the pronoun suffix can explain only the cAbd al-Razzãq version about Adam's learning the salutation. It cannot explain the Qatãda/Ibn cAjlãn versions about striking the face.32 Ibn Qutayba also mentions a yet more explicit version &lt; Ibn cUmar &lt; the Prophet: 'God (mighty and glorious is He) created Adam in the image of the Most Merciful (i al-rahmãn ).'33 This is presumably the one documented by Ibn Abi cÄsim. In one version, from YOsuf b. Musã (Kufan, d. 253/867), the Prophet says, 'Do not pronounce faces ugly, for the son of Adam was created in the image of the Most Merciful.' In the other, from Abu'l-Rablc (Sulaymãn b. Däwüd, Basran, lived in Baghdad, d. 234/848-9), with an otherwise identical isnãd, the Prophet says, 'Do not pronounce faces ugly, for God (mighty and glorious is He) created Adam in His image.'34 Ibn Qutayba charges that this was the work of someone who wanted to emphasise that the pronoun meant God, not Adam, and so made the ludicrous mistake of substituting al-rahmãn for the pronoun. Given the preponderance of versions mentioning 'his image' rather than 'the image of the Most Merciful', this seems very likely, with Yösuf b. Musã being the particular transmitter at fault. Ibn Abl cÃsim</page><page sequence="7">'God Created Adam in His Image' 119 also relates a completely unrelated version &lt; Ibn Abl Maryam (Egyptian, d. 224/ 838-9) &lt; Ibn Lahlca (Egyptian, d. 174/790-1) &lt; Abü Yünus Sulaym b. Jubayr (Egyptian, d. 123/740-1) &lt; Abü Hurayra &lt; the Messenger of God: 'Whoever fights, let him avoid the face, for the man's face is in the image of the Most Merciful.'35 All we can say of this with certainty is that a version with 'the Most Merciful' circulated in Egypt in the early third/ninth century. The least objectionable interpretation he has seen, Ibn Qutayba goes on, is that this means that God created Adam in heaven in the same image as he would have on earth.36 But in the end he prefers not to interpret. First, he has read in the Torah that God created Adam in His image. Secondly, he cites a hadlth report by which, after Moses had struck the rock and told them 'Drink, you asses', God rebuked him, saying by inspiration, 'I created them in My image but you have likened them to asses.' Thirdly, this is not more amazing than what is said in the Qur'an about hands, fingers, and the eye (of God).37 It has been a common mistake to identify Ibn Qutayba straitly with the Hanball traditionalists of his time. Actually, he belongs generally with the semi-rationalist middle party of his time.38 On the question of Adam's image, however, it may be admitted that, notwithstanding his accusing some traditionalists of relating distorted hadlth reports, his final position is fairly close to that of Ahmad, mainly to relate the hadlth report without evasive interpretation. As al-Nawaw! would describe this position:39 Among the culamã ' there are some who refrain from interpreting it, saying, 'We believe it is true, that its evident meaning is not what was intended ( zahiruhu ghayr murãd), and that it has a suitable meaning.' This is the doctrine of most of the predecessors ( salaf ). It is more cautious and safer. It is the position notably upheld in the fifth/eleventh century by the Qãdl Abü Yaclã b. al-Farrã3 (d. Baghdad, 458/1065).40 I do not mean to argue that it is incumbent on Muslims today, even such as recognise the long version (with 'God created Adam in his image') as an authentic quotation of the Prophet. Adam's image is not discussed in al-Tabari's commentary, perhaps because he did not wish to provoke Hanbalï ire; but neither is it discussed in later commentaries, so far as I have found, such as those of al-Mãwardl (d. 450/1058) and al-Qurtubï (d. 671/ 1273?). Presumably, the first reason is that it had not become established in the commentary tradition and that they might consider the argument settled. Conceivably, al-Mãwardl in particular may have omitted to discuss it because, influenced as he was by Muctazilï thought, he was especially offended by the suggestion of anthropomorphism. Neither is it taken up by al-Thaclabï (d. Nishapur, 427/1035) in his Qisas al-anbiyã ' although of course he does devote a substantial chapter to Adam. Al-Thaclabï's discussion of Adam's creation omits mention of his being in the image</page><page sequence="8">120 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of God. In an elaborate story of parading Adam's image before God had blown His spirit into him, al-ThaclabI does say that the angels were amazed by the comeliness of his image, never having seen one like it, which seems incompatible with his being in the image of God. The angels' prostration was sujud tďzJm wa-tahiyya , al-Thaclabï comments, not sujud salãh wa-cibãda.4X Al-Thaclabf s story of the parading of Adam's image before the angels is related to the Qur'an's famous report that God commanded the angels to prostrate themselves to Adam. This caused some consternation among the exegetes, for the Qur'an emphatically forbids any sharing of divine honours with other beings. Satan refused and has sometimes been acclaimed in the Sufi tradition for his exceeding faithfulness, accepting expulsion from heaven rather than bow down to anything but God.42 A similar story is recounted in The Life of Adam and Eve', a Jewish or Christian apocryphon (if the latter, possibly a Christian elaboration of an originally Jewish story) from some time before 600 AD. In the extant Latin version (presumably a translation of an earlier Greek version, since an Armenian version seems to be based on the same), God expressly commands the angels to prostrate themselves to Adam because he has been created in the image of God, while Satan refuses to prostrate himself expressly because he had been created before Adam.43 It is apparently a commonplace among students of Christian apocrypha, although not (yet) students of the Qur'an, that the Qur'anic story presupposes this apocryphon.44 The failure of our commentators to mention the story from The Life of Adam and Eve' is not a decisive argument against its being part of the background to the Qur'an. They say nothing of the controversy over ahâdïth about the creation of Adam in God's image, either. The Qur'an continually comments on stories in such an allusive way that it can hardly have been introducing them for the first time to its earliest audience, and the story of the angels' prostrating themselves to Adam is only one of many such stories that do not appear in the canonical Bible but do in known extrabiblical literature.45 Although repeatedly mentioning the angels' prostrating themselves to Adam, the Qur'an does not comment on the explanation in The Life of Adam and Eve' that this was because he had been made in the image of God. It is more a theological question than historical whether to take this lack of comment as implicit acceptance or rejection of the Biblical doctrine that God created Adam in His image. It seems unnecessary: as the commentators do observe, Joseph sees stars, sun and moon bowing down to him in a prophetic dream (Q. 12:4), and his family do prostrate themselves to him later on (Q. 12:100). Angelic prostration to Adam need imply that Adam was in the image of God no more than the prostration of Joseph's family implies that Joseph was in the image of God. (This said, the bowing to Joseph also bothered many commentators, who proposed that in kharrü lahu sujjadan ( they fell down before him), the pronoun refers to God, not Joseph, or that the falling down here was merely an inclination of</page><page sequence="9">'God Created Adam in His Image' 121 the head or upper body; also that, Joseph having earlier separated his parents from his brothers, it was only the latter who offered him worship.46 Later commentators seem to be more bothered than earlier.47) To conclude, it seems to me significant that the story from The Life of Adam and Eve' does not, at least so far as I have discovered, survive in hadïth. It was widely believed by at least the later second/eighth century and into the third/ninth that God had created Adam in His image. For this we have the evidence of widely attested hadïth reports. But that belief was founded on hadïth reports echoing verses of the canonical Bible, not Biblical apocrypha. Although needing confirmation from parallel studies of other echoes in the Qur'an of apocryphal literature, it appears that Christian apocrypha tended to drop out of the second/eighth-century debate in favour of canonical texts. (This agrees with the assumption that hadïth reports about Adam's creation in the image of God were invented in the second/eighth century, not remembered from the first/seventh, at least in the explicit form that we have them. However, it does not depend on it. It is equally conceivable that hadïth reports echoing apocryphal literature were common in the second/eighth century but forgotten in the third/ninth.) Secondly, the controversial hadïth reports seem to be more crudely anthropomorphic than the Biblical passages they echo. It is as if heightened concern among Muslim theologians to preserve divine transcendence mirrored a heightened predilection among others, notably Hadïth folk, for anthropomorphism.48 It also seems worthwhile observing that the semi-rationalists or ahi al-ithbãt who either shortened hadïth reports about Adam's creation or explained them in anti-anthropomorphic terms are the party that dominated the specialised tafsïr literature. This is one reason why God's creating Adam in His image does not come up in Qur'anic commentary. Finally, I hope it is clear that one may not restrict investigations of beliefs about prophets to the literature of tafsïr , of qisas al-anbiyã' or even theology, which the early traditionalists tended on principle not to write. A complete survey of early Muslims' beliefs must extend to hadïth literature as well. NOTES 1 E.g. Brannon M.

Earlier still, al-Tabari relates the assurance of six commentators that it was a customary greeting at that time, a matter of good manners rather than worship, but pays no attention to the question of whether his parents were excused from prostrating themselves, likewise of whether it took some other form than the familiar prostration on seven points (al-Tabari, Jãmic al-bayãn (31 vols, Cairo: al-Matbaca al-Maymaniyya, 1321, repr. 13 vols, Beirut: Dãr al-Kutub al-cIlmiyya, 1420/1999), vol. 7, pp. 303-4, ad Q. 12:100). 48 'Hadith folk' represents ahi al-hadith , with deliberate allusion to their commonsense populism; see Marshall G.S.
