The development of the concept of alive by preschoolers through a cognitive conflict teaching intervention Vassiliki Zogza Yannis Papamichael University of Pairas, Greece The aim of this research was the conceptual change and transformation of the intuitive conceptions of preschoolers concerning life through a cognitive - conflict teaching intervention. Young children use the criterion of movement to justify the classification of objects as living or non-living, that is classify plants as non-living because they are immobile and mobile non-alive objects as living. The concept of life includes many sub-concepts and movement is a secondary and not a universal characteristic of living organisms. The subjects of this research were chosen according to their replies concerning the classification of plants as non-living. Subjects of the experimental group received a teaching intervention aiming at the change of their conceptual context about life and focusing mainly at the dependence of an organism to its environment. In the teaching intervention we used the procedure of cognitive conflict through the juxtaposition of live organisms to dead ones and mobile simulations. Our results show that all the children of experimental group presented a conceptual change classifying the plant as alive and using explanations including the dependence on environment and other functions, increasing the number of criteria used for justification of the animal as living. Introduction The concept of life is one of the most studied concepts. It has been studied mainly as a concept showing the degree of cognitive development of a child (Piaget, 1929; Laurendeau &amp; Pinard, 1962; Looft, 1974; Brown &amp; Desforges, 1977; Lucas, Linke, &amp; Sedgwick, 1979; Tamir, Gal-Chopin, Nussinovitz, 1981; Gelman, Spelk, &amp; Meek, 1983; Carey, 1985; Springer &amp; Keil, 1991; Rosengren, Gelman, Kalish, &amp; McCormick, 1991; Backscheider, Shatz, &amp; We would like to thank Marianthi Sarmonika and Christina Tyrosvouti for their help in collection of the experimental data, and preparation of the teaching intervention.</page><page sequence="2">192 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAMICHAEL Gelman, 1993; Hatano &amp; Inagaki, 1997). The most famous of these studies are certainly those of Piaget (1929), who established a framework based on the criterion of movement. The most significant idea of Piaget's work was the animism in the child's thought which can be analyzed as: (1) causal reasoning, (2) excessive attribution of intentions to non-living things, (3) attribution of life characteristics to non-living. According to Piaget, children do not usually perceive the natural cause and the only pattern of explanation available to them is the attribution of intention or activity to things. So, anything that can show a kind of activity is classified to living things. Piaget suggested that the development of the concept of life passes through four stages in the child's thought: Stage A (age 6-7) in which an object demonstrating some activity such as making a noise or falling down is considered to be alive. Stage B (age 8-9) in which life is identified by movement, and any moving object is considered to be alive. Stage C (age 9-11) in which only things which exhibit spontaneous movement (sun, wind, river) are considered to be alive and to have consciousness. Stage D (age 11 and up) in which children correctly identify only living creatures as being alive and possessing consciousness. Many other researchers followed Piaget' s work. The largest of these studies was that of Laurendeau and Pinard (1962), who interviewed 500 subjects between 4-12 years of age, and agreed with Piaget's conclusions with a slight difference. They didn't find a discrimination between stages 1 and 2 of Piaget. Other studies on the same subject and the same methodology gave support to the above results (Jahoda, 1958; Looft &amp; Bartz, 1969). However, studies that used a different methodology and focused on what children conceive as 'the characteristics of life' opened the issue again. These sort of studies opened an enormous field for research. One of the first studies was undertaken by Looft (1974) who asked children 'Does a frog breath or need air?' 'Do automobiles reproduce or make more things just like them?' 'Does a chair need food or nutrition?'. Looft also asked if the objects he used in his questions were living or non-living. His significant discovery was that some students could correctly classify the objects as living or non-living, but there was a lack of understanding of the characteristics of life. Another study, by Smeets (1973), investigated whether children are able to attribute the following characteristics of life (dying, growing, feeling, knowing, speaking) to living and non-living objects. He found that these life processes were often wrongly attributed to non-living objects. Working in a different tradition, where the conceptual development of children is studied under a psychological perspective, Carey (1985), chose to study the development of the children's understanding of living (alive)/non-living (non-alive) and their parallel biological knowledge between the ages of 4 and 12. Carey has also observed childhood animism and emphasizes the importance of understanding this phenomenon in building up a picture of conceptual change in childhood. She noted that Piaget uses only one criterion for each stage, simply to support his hypothesis of developmental stages, while children use more than one criterion each time. Carey suggested that the use of the context of 'alive' and 'non-alive' was simplistic and forced children to proceed into a classification that does not have any meaning to them and their inevitable failure to make the classification was due to the lack of biological knowledge. On the basis of her evidence she claimed that this knowledge gradually improves with the increase in age and results in a domain-specific restructuring and that it is this restructuring that results in the improvement of children's ability to answer the question of whether an object is alive/non-alive. Her argument was that the evidence showed that there was a major restructuring of the domain-specific knowledge by the child that reached the age of 10. This gave the child the ability to conceptualize the human body as an integrated functioning system of internal organs with functions and perceive other organisms in similar terms.</page><page sequence="3">THE CONCEPT OF ALIVE BY PRESCHOOLERS 193 Lucas, Linke, and Sedgwick (1979) identified a number of methodological errors in these studies and claimed that the increasing competence with age may simply reflect an increasing familiarity with the everyday objects that are used. Secondly there are conceptual difficulties with the "attributes of life" used, which are strongly biased towards humans and ignore plants. The consequence of this is a tendency to over-rely on an anthropomorphic framework, which would result in category errors. Finally, as Carey, they suggested that the method of the interview that was used forced criteria on the children which are not necessarily the same as those, that children would use spontaneously. In short, previous studies seem to have attempted to reduce the child's view about the world in a description, which later was shown by other studies, to be simplistic. The evidence is that there are several aspects in the criteria used by children, and in this respect their intuitive biological knowledge is of great importance. In recent years there has been a growing number of investigations of children's intuitive knowledge of biology and biological processes (Gelman et al., 1983; Carey, 1985; Stavy &amp; Wax, 1989; Rosengren et al., 1991; Gelman &amp; Kremer, 1991; Springer &amp; Keil, 1991; Backscheider, Shatz, &amp; Gelman, 1993; Hatano &amp; Inagaki, 1997). Carey has suggested that young children have a poor understanding of biology that is best described as based on a social theory of human behaviour rather than on biological theory. Carey suggests that children do not develop sophisticated biological theories until the age of 9 or 10. In contrast, there is a growing number of studies showing that children do have naive biological knowledge and apply this knowledge when they are asked to classify objects as living or non living (Gelman et al., 1983; Hatano &amp; Inagaki, 1994; Springer &amp; Keil, 1991). Thus Inagaki and Hatano (Inagaki &amp; Hatano, 1994; Hatano, Siegler, Richards, Inagaki, Stavy, &amp; Wax, 1993), have reported that young children hold some biological beliefs distinct from psychology. Similarly Springer and Keil (1989), found that preschool children appear to have some understanding of biological notions of inheritance. They agree that young children's biological theories exist, but are less developed than those of older children and adults. Gelman and Kremer (1991), found that children of 4-7 years perceive that there are natural causes. In another study by the Gelman group (Rosengren et al., 1991) it was noticed that children 3-6 years of age understand that animals (and not artifacts) grow with time. The results of the above study show that even very young children have intuitive knowledge about natural transformations. In another study (Backscheider et al., 1993) the ability of living organisms to heal through re-growth was used as a measure of children's implicit understanding that plants and animals can be grouped together. Their findings were that 4-year-olds realized that both plants and animals can re-grow but that artifacts must be repaired by human intervention. 3-year-olds were less knowledgeable but did realize that artifacts cannot re-grow. Overall, children showed some biological knowledge, implicitly grouping plants and animals together and differentiating them from artifacts. Gelman and her colleagues suggest that on the way to developing the kinds of distinctions needed for mature theories, children may recognize other dichotomies based on salient properties or partial knowledge. Children may first realize that plants and animals are both living kinds by contrasting them to artifacts. Two salient characteristics on which living kinds differ from artifacts are growth and dependence on natural, not intentional cause. The educational aspect of the distinction of living-non living It is obvious from the previous review of the relevant literature that the development of the concept of life, as it is represented by the classification of objects as living/non-living, has been studied by many researchers and an enormous amount of data has been accumulated. The existing data seems to be controversial, due to the complexity of the concept of life itself, and the complexity of results that are derived through different methodologies and contexts of research. The complexity of the concept of life has been analyzed by previous studies (Maurer, 1970; Lucas et al., 1979; O-saki &amp; Samiroden, 1990).</page><page sequence="4">194 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAMICHAEL We also think that a strong factor contributing to the complexity of studies and results about the concept of life, is the concept of life itself. There has never been a single definition of the concept of life. The 'traditional' seven characteristics of living organisms are: (1) growth, (2) reproduction, (3) external respiration-breathing, (4) nutrition, (5) excretion, (6) irritability, (7) locomotion. The 'traditional' seven characteristics clearly favor the animal kingdom at a complex, multi-cellular level. The invention of the microscope made it possible for scientists to add a structural criterion, i.e. cells and internal organization, to the older idea of constancy of living organisms. Further scientific advances resulted in the identification of biochemical characteristics of living organisms, i.e. the presence of organic constituents such as DNA, energy transformations (metabolism-cellular respiration), heredity, evolution. On the other hand the diversity of life that was discovered showed that organisms had all these characteristics in common except the characteristic of locomotion (movement). Thus, the scientifically accepted characteristics of life today, common to all organisms (Gottfried, 1993; Starr, 1994; Enger, Kormelink, Ross, &amp; Smith, 1994) are: (1) organization, (2) metabolism, (3) development-growth, (4) reproduction (DNA, heredity), (5) evolution, (6) behavior, (7) homeostasis. The concept 'alive' is basic to learning the biological topics since it is a prerequisite to distinguishing living things from inanimate objects, as well as for appreciating the various attributes of living things. However, young children have difficulties with the concept, even after some study of the topic. There are obvious differences between life characteristics in plants and animals: plants are stationary, depend on sunshine, have chlorophyll, whereas animals are mobile and have no chlorophyll. All are alive however, since they have all the above characteristics of life in common. To children these ideas develop gradually, after experience and learning. Findings from other studies concerning the nutrition of plants, show that an early development of the concept of life is important to children's understanding of plant nutrition, because they apply the model of animals to plants (Waheed &amp; Lucas, 19924; Barker, 1995; Zogza, Sarmonika, &amp; Oeconomopoulou, 1996; Zogza &amp; Oeconomopoulou, 1999; Hadjinikita, Koulaidis, &amp; Zogza, 1999). It is important to point out that Piaget's stages of the concept of life are based on the criterion of movement that children use in order to decide if an entity is alive or not. By considering also the results of other relevant studies we came to conclude that when young children use the criterion of movement alone they tend to attribute life to non living things in the case that these are moving and do not attribute life to plants as plants are not moving. In other words we suggest that the criterion of movement appears to be a cognitive obstacle for their understanding and classification of objects as living or non-living, because in a way it covers their intuitive biological knowledge of other, more universal aspects of life. From a pedagogical point of view, what interests us is the correct classification of plants to living from an early age, and the development of the concept of the plant as a living organism in parallel with that of the animal. We believe this is important for the subsequent introduction of school scientific knowledge about biological processes in plants. Thus the correct classification of plants as living organisms by using criteria that concern the biological processes instead of the criterion of movement from an early age, we believe is a prerequisite for the following introduction of plant processes in school science. In the present work our aim was to develop a teaching intervention for children of 5 years of age (nursery in Greece), for the destabilization of the criterion of movement as the only criterion used to justify the classification of plants and animals as alive or not and to use instead criteria related to biological processes. Having in mind that the meaning of non alive is equally important, and in this case the most useful concept from all the concepts of non-alive was the concept of death (Maurer, 1970; O-saki &amp; Samiroden, 1990), we wanted them to understand this in comparing a living to non living thing. So we designed an experimental teaching intervention that would use cognitive-conflict (Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1974; Doise &amp;</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF ALIVE BY PRESCHOOLERS 195 Mugni, 1981; Perret-Clermont, 1979; Vygotski, 1986/1934; Ravanis &amp; Papamichael, 1995; Ravanis &amp; Bagakis, 1998) between their everyday knowledge and knowledge presented through instruction and the observation of certain objects and their properties. Theoretical background for the development of the teaching intervention This research concerns the study of the educational procedure in the structuring of a conceptual framework, domain-specific, in this case biology-specific. In order to develop the proper educational intervention we had to consider: (1) the didactical transformation of the subject, (2) the existing data about the development of biological knowledge, (3) aspects of children's reasoning. Regarding the educational transformation of the subject, as Chevallard (1985) suggests, we have to consider two aspects: (a) conceptual analysis of the concept of living - life, (b) the necessities/requirements for learning as they are defined by the necessities/requirements of treatment of the zone of proximal development (Vygotski, 1986/1934; Hedegaard, 1990) for the construction of this conceptual scheme by children of this age. For the planning of the educational intervention we used the data of previous studies showing that children develop naive biological theories from an early age (Backscheider et al., 1993; Hatano &amp; Inagaki, 1997). This incomplete biological knowledge when it is applied to the classification of living/non-living may lead to wrong classifications. Young children 4-6 years old use movement as the first and sometimes the only criterion to justify their classification of an object in the category of living. For instance, they apply the characteristic of movement to mobile non-alive objects like a cloud or a battery-driven automobile and classify them in the alive category (pilot study). As we have already mentioned, the criterion of movement is only a secondary characteristic of life and it is not universal. So the recognition of life on the basis of movement is in the wrong direction in the process of development of the concept of living. As previous studies have shown young children are able to recognize biological processes such as: - growth-development and - needs for survival of the living organisms (interaction of organism with its environment and mainly the dependence of the organism on the environment). We also take into account the findings from other studies (Rosengren et al., 1991; Backscheider et al., 1993) that children recognize forms of non-life (artifacts), as not exhibiting biological functions, i.e. dependence on the environment. In order to promote the construction of the concept of the dependence of the living on the environment we used in our intervention the basic property of a living organism, which is the possibility of death when dependence on the environment is interrupted. The above correlation (environment dependence - death) unifies the concept of the living in a signifying system, which is the conceptual field of the living. In order to achieve this correlation with teaching, our emphasis was in constructing a model of the basic functions related to the dependence of the living on the environment (feeding, breathing) for the continuation of its life, and the possibility of death when this dependence is interrupted. In this way the basic property that defines the living organism as a system, is materialized. The integration of other functions and properties of the living system (growth, development, reproduction) into the model, would make the construction of the concept of the living more difficult, by the introduction of additional elements. We even chose one of the two sorts of dependence - nutrition, breathing - the first as more easily understood by children for both animals and plants. The zone of proximal development concerning the living, that we aim to shape with the teaching intervention includes: (a) a destabilization of the phenomenological, intuitive connection of the living with movement, (b) its replacement with the constant, continuous dependence of the living on its environment, (c) unification of the conceptual field of living,</page><page sequence="6">196 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAMICHAEL through the interruption of the continuity of dependence on the environment that leads to the basic property of the living, death. From the above we are led to the following hypotheses: 1)The cognitive conflicts produced by simple observation and the contradictions that arise from the connection of the concept of living with movement, would not be sufficient for the overcoming this cognitive obstacle unless these are introduced by teaching in a broader unifying context of the concept of living that links living with the dependence on the environment. 2) The didactical transformation of the concept of the living for subjects of pre-school age and the construction of a zone of proximal development aimed at the learning of this concept, has to focus on the construction by the child of a scheme of constant dependence of the living on the environment. The conceptual context of this relation will substitute the intuitive criterion of linking alive with movement, that is characteristic of children of this age, only if the scheme of continuity of the dependence on the environment and the basic functions of nutrition, will be grounded on the conception of living that young pupils have about alive. From the above general hypotheses we can derive the following working hypotheses: 1) The experimental group would show greater progress than the control group as regards to the escape of the subjects from the pattern of connecting alive with movement for both the immobile (plant) and the mobile (animal) living system. 2) The subjects of the experimental group would show better achievements than the subjects of the control group, both in tasks of classification of various objects as living systems, and in causal explanations for the justification of their classification as well. In this report we show that children can be guided through the proper intervention to realize the dependence of an animal and a plant on its food, water and other elements from the environment - the process of nutrition that stops when a living organism dies - in comparison with a mobile (animal) or immobile (plant) simulation that do not have any survival needs and do not die. This cognitive conflict with their everyday knowledge may destabilize their attachment to the criterion of movement as a main criterion for classifying objects as living things, and they may use attributes of life including biological processes to justify their choice. Furthermore they will come to recognize that plants have similar functions to animals and thus realize that plants are alive too. Method and experimental procedure Our aim was to research the conditions and the procedures that are suitable for the approach of the concept of life by children of pre-school age (5 year olds) and try to apply a teaching intervention concerning this concept. The experimental procedure includes four successive stages: the first pre-test, the pre-test, the main procedure and the post-test. The first pre-test had two aims, one was to detect children's preconceptions concerning the concept of life and to verify that movement is being generalized by children as life's main characteristic and therefore it forms a great problem for its recognition in cases of living organisms where movement isn't an apparent element of their behaviour (as in plants) or in cases where non-living things can be put in motion (as toys). The second aim of the first pre test was to identify the subjects that do not classify plants as living things, so as to subsequently work with them in the teaching intervention. Immediately before the educational intervention another pre-test was undertaken. Both pre-tests and the post-test were individual guided personal interviews, where a structured questionnaire was used and they were tape-recorded. During the intervention conflicts and contradictions were produced between children's existing ideas and the 'scientific' ones so as to obtain cognitive progress. In this phase</page><page sequence="7">THE CONCEPT OF ALI VE BY PRESCHOOLERS 197 children that were selected from the first pre-test were separated into an experimental group and a control group of alternative treatment and the intervention applied only to the former. This intervention included a story (see teaching intervention), pictures and real objects (living and non-living things, real, dead and artificial spider, and real, artificial and dead plant). The post-test consisted of a repetition of the tasks and questions asked during the pre-test (posing the same questions about the above objects). The comparison of the two tests (pre and post) follows. Sample The subjects were initially 46 (during the first pre-test) and came from two central nursery schools of Patras. Their age was from 5 to 6 years of age. After the 1 st pre-test, 18 children, 9 boys and 9 girls, were chosen to follow the main procedure and the post-test. The 18 children that were selected to enter the main procedure classified plants as non-living. The 18 children were subdivided to form 2 groups of 9 children each, one experimental and one alternative. Questions and tasks of the pre-tests In the 1st pre-test, each child was called separately and after making an acquaintance with him/her, was asked to answer a few questions for each of the things that he/she was to observe: The order of the objects which we decided to ask them about were: 1st object: 2-3 spiders in a plastic container together with bits of plant twigs, leaves and soil. (This was chosen to be the first object, because animals are recognized as alive by almost all the children because of their movement). 2nd object: A battery-driven mobile toy-car (A non-alive object with movement). 3rd object: Elements of nature with movement (cloud, river). 4th object: A healthy flowering plant in a flower pot. The following questions were asked: 1) Is this living? If the child found it difficult to answer, the question was repeated as follows: Does it have life? 2) How do you understand it? In this second question children were asked repeatedly ("can you think of something else") to give the children the opportunity to give more than one criteria to justify their classification. In the results section we will refer to the answers that the children gave in the 1st pre-test. According to their answers, we first selected the children that were to follow the main procedure, that is we chose the children that did not classify the plant as living. The selected children were then separated into two groups of 9 children. Given that the main aim of this research was to destabilize the cognitive obstacle of movement as the main criterion used by children in deciding if something is alive and to lead them to accept that plants are living organisms, children that hadn't included plants as living creatures during the first pre-test, were chosen to take part in the main procedure, whereas the others were excluded. After two days, these children were called again separately, for the pre-test and the intervention. Children were asked questions of the 2nd pre-test about the following objects: a living spider, an artificial spider, a real plant, an artificial plant, a mobile toy-car. They were asked to classify these objects as living/non-living, and justify their answer.</page><page sequence="8">198 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAMICHAEL Teaching intervention in the experimental and alternative group (a) Experimental group. The choice of the experimental condition was based on the previously mentioned theoretical background. The objects used were: a live animal, a mobile artificial animal, a dead animal, and a live, healthy plant, an artificial plant and a dead plant. The choice of the animal and plant used was determined by certain requirements. We had to find an animal that (a) feeds itself in an obvious way, so as to survive, b) be tiny and children wouldn't be sorry for it if it was dead, (c) find an available simulation of it, which would be mobile as well. Our final choice was the spider, because its way of feeding is apparent - making a web and capturing little flies, and nobody would be sorry if it was dead, and a mobile toy-spider was also found. The plant had to be herbaceous with flowers, that could easily die out of lack of sufficient water, and a similar artificial one made out of plastic and cloth, was also made available. First part - Animal While children were observing living spiders, a dead spider, and a picture showing spiders in their web, they were told a story about a spider and its baby-spiders, which gave emphasis to the spider's need for food and the dependence of its life on its environment and the availability of food. Then a conversation followed which centered around the following questions: (1) What did the spider need in order to stay alive? (2) Now that it is dead, what can't it do? The mobile toy-spider and the mobile toy-car were not included in the intervention. Second part - Plant In the second part they were shown a plant in a flower-pot and a conversation started about what the plant's needs were in order to stay alive. Then a brief presentation of the plant was given to them stressing its needs (a picture was also used) and its dependence on environment (water, sun, air) were discussed. Then a dead plant was presented (in a kind of favoring comparison) asking them to explain why it had become like that. Lastly they were shown an artificial plant with a flower (in a flower pot) and they were asked whether it needed something so as to live. Our aim was to help them understand the difference between a living plant (which in their pre-test was classified as non-living) and a non-living artificial plant. In the cognitive field, we considered that a sociological-cognitive conflict by giving them information that they hadn't thought or even imagine at first, would help. (b) Alternative group. We call this group "alternative" because it is not a simple control group although it works as a control to the experimental. In fact subjects of the alternative procedure group, didn't have any teaching intervention concerning animals like the above of the Exp. Group, and they were simply observing the same objects. What we wanted to detect in this alternative procedure group was whether their idea about movement as an attribute of life would be applied to plants too, if we put the plants in motion, that is create a windy atmosphere. So we used a small electric fan the air of which made the artificial plant move and we asked them if the plant was alive and how could they justify their answer. Post-test In the post-test our aim was to check what the children had assimilated and to find out whether our teaching intervention had had any positive results on the children's conception of the concept of life. So, after a week we presented them with the same living and non-living things (the same plant, a spider of the same species, the artificial plant and the artificial spider and the toy car), and we posed the same questions we used in the pre-test: "Is it alive?", and "How do you understand that?", for each item. In order to test reliability we were quite persistent for justification.</page><page sequence="9">THE CONCEPT OF ALIVE BY PRESCHOOLERS 199 Results and discussion A. First pre-test for the selection of subjects From the total of 46 children that took part in the pre-test, they all (46) accepted that the real spider was alive justifying their answer with the criterion of movement, almost all of them (45), though they were persistently asked to give another explanation, and only one child mentioned a behavioural characteristic of the spider, the ability of making a 'house'-web (see Table 1 and 2).

See Tables 2 and 3. Regarding the plant, it was considered alive by 23 children due to its external morphology (9 children), biological processes (5 children) and its dependence on its environment (18 children). But 22 children considered the plant as not-alive due to the lack of movement (12 children), due to animistic thought (10 children) and tautology or no reason given (6 children). For the classification of the responses of children we used as a basis the scientifically acceptable characteristics of life. In the category biological processes, we include replies referring to growth and reproduction. In the category dependence on the environment are included the "dependence on soil" (plant, 10 children) and the "dependence on water or food" (plant, 9 children). The category behaviour includes the activities of an animal, such as "the</page><page sequence="10">200 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAM1CHAEL making of a house-web", "food collection", "taking care of the spider-babies" and so on. The category relation with other living things includes responses like "it contains fishes", "animals drink water from it", "man drives it". Table 3 Criteria of non-life used for justification of classification of objects as non-alive (1st pre-test) Response categories plant Frequencies toy-car river no movement 12 - - no autonomous movement - 5 - animistic explanation 10 4 8 toy-not real - 3 - by comparison to other non living things - - 2 no explanation 6 - 5 From the 1st pre-test results, it is apparent that the most popular indicator of life is movement. It is interesting to note that from the total of 22 children that considered the plant not-alive, 15 children had considered the toy-car alive, because of its movement. It is also interesting to note that children who classify the plant as living justify their answer by using biological attributes and more than one criteria. The same children, however classify the spider as alive justifying their answer by the criterion of movement only. We think that this is evidence that children do possess some biological knowledge, but do not apply it in all the situations. For them it is sufficient to use the criterion of movement alone when they justify the classification of animals as living things, because this is the most obvious characteristic. They use one criterion only for animals, mobile toy-car and the river (25 children), but some of them (7 children) use 2 or 3 criteria for plants. B. 2nd Pre-test and Post-test The results of the 2nd pre-test are presented in the Table 4, in comparison with the post-test, for both groups. The criteria of life that children used to justify their answer in the post-test are presented in Table 5. After the group separation and the teaching intervention on the experimental group only we had the following findings from the post-test: Table 4 Results of the 2nd pre-test in comparison with the post-test.

Examples of children replies are: "The plant is alive because we have plant it in the soil, it has roots, we water it", "it is in bloom, it needs water", "it takes food from the earth, it needs water, care", "it would die if we do not water it". The plant was considered not-alive by 8 children of the alternative procedure group (A.G.) because of the lack of movement (8), and because of the lack of human characteristics (2), and alive because it wasn't dead ('dry') by one child. (Where the sum of the numbers exceed that of the subjects, it is because we have some of the children citing more than one reasons for explaining their answer.) Regarding the real spider all the children of E.G. considered it alive. All of them used movement as the first criterion, and after further questioning ("what else does it do?") they accepted its dependence on the environment (6), biological processes (5), behaviour (7). Examples of children replies are: "The spider is alive because it walks, eats, makes its web", "it walks, needs food, air", "it moves its legs, makes web, gives food to its children". The children of the A.G. on the other hand, said that it was alive "because it could move" and no other attribute was added upon further questioning. About the artificial plant, all the children of the E.G. accepted that it wasn't alive "because it was fake or a toy" (6 children) and 7 of them gave this answer after contrasting it with the real one as not having environment dependence (Table 6). Examples of children replies are: "The plant is not alive because it is fake, doesn't have roots, we do not water it", "it is fake doesn't need any water", "it is fake, needs nothing". Whereas 7 children of the A.G. said that it wasn't alive because of lack of movement and when further questioned, they said it would be alive if it moved or if there was "wind" and 2 of them said that it was alive because it could move due to the little fan that was nearby. We have to note here that during the intervention about the plant in the alternative procedure group, and during the conversation held on the question about the living or not of the real plant, 6 children said that the plant was alive because its leaves were moving due to the "windy" atmosphere. Regarding the artificial spider it was considered not-alive (Table 6) by 5 children of the experimental group because it was a toy contrasting it with the real spider, and 4 children concluded finally that it was not alive since it had no dependence on the environment to get its food ("couldn't eat, couldn't drink", "it cannot eat, because it's a toy"). As regards to the alternative group, the answers were more definite: 6 children said that the artificial spider was alive because it moved and 3 children not-alive because they attributed the movement to human operation/action. When the children of the experimental group were asked about the toy-car, 6 of them said that it wasn't alive (3 children because it was a toy, 1 child gave animistic explanation - "has no eyes" - and 2 gave no explanation). From the alternative group 6 children said that it was</page><page sequence="12">202 V. ZOGZA &amp; Y. PAPAMICHAEL alive because it moved, and 3 concluded that it was fake-it needed batteries (to move), that is the same children as in the pre-test. Thus the toy-car was considered alive by 7 children of the Exp. Group before the intervention, but only by one after the intervention. On the contrary in the Alternative Group the number of children that believe the toy-car alive is the same before and after the intervention, and the explanation given is movement.

No such explanations are given from subjects of the alternative group. This fact shows that simple observation of the objects is not sufficient for the realization of the concept of the dependence of a living organism on the environment, even when in some cases we have a submission of the intuitive connection of movement with alive by time. The catalytic role of the didactical modeling of the conceptual field of alive-non alive seems to be confirmed from this data. Conclusions If we want to summarize the findings of this work we may say that: (1) In the case of the plant all the children of the experimental group classified it as living after the intervention, justifying their answer with biological attributes (environment dependence and biological procedures). From the 9 children of the alternative group only one changed its mind and classified the plant as living (in comparison to the dead plant). Thus we have a greater progress in the E.G. in accordance to our first hypothesis. (2) In the case of the real spider the children of both groups classify it to the living before and after the intervention. However the children of the Exp. Group after the intervention use more than one criteria to justify their answer, adding biological attributes to the criterion of movement, in contrast to the children of the Alternative Group who keep using the criterion of movement only. So our 2nd hypothesis about the subjects of the E.G. that would use causal explanations proved to be true also. We have to note, however that the criterion of movement is very strong when an animal is under question and it is always used as the first criterion.</page><page sequence="13">THE CONCEPT OF ALIVE BY PRESCHOOLERS 203 (3) In the case of the mobile toy-car that was considered alive due to its movement by 7 children of the Exp. Group and 6 children of the Alternative Group before the intervention, we note that at the end of the intervention 6 children of the Exp. Group change their classification to the correct non-living, whereas no change is observed in the answers of the Alt. Group. Overall our results show that it is possible for the children to replace the criterion of movement, in the case of the plant, by biological characteristics of life and in the case of the animal to use biological characteristics as well as the criterion of movement. The results of the Alternative Group show that the criterion of movement is certainly very powerful and resistant and it is very important to succeed in the destabilization of the cognitive obstacle of movement by using teaching interventions like the one used with the children of the Exp. Group. More teaching interventions could be designed based on other aspects of life that young children recognize, like growth and re-growth (Backsheider et al., 1993; Rosengren et al., 1991). We think however that because the intervention and the post-test had the same target animals and plants, the observed effects for the experimental group children should be explained in terms of learning about specific entities rather and not of conceptual change. We would be more definite in claiming that we have a certain conceptual change about life if we would show that the experimental group children could generalize their judgment and explanation to other living things that were apparently dissimilar to the target animal or plant in the intervention.

L'objectif de cette recherche est l'étude du changement conceptuel de la notion du vivant chez les enfants d'âge préscolaire. Selon notre hypothèse, il est possible de favoriser le changement conceptuel en soumettant aux enfants des tâches qui incitent à la construction de modèles plus élaborés. Dans le but de mettre cette hypothèse à l'épreuve, nous avons conduit cette recherche avec des élèves dont les connaissances comportaient uniquement des conceptions vitalistes et/ou mécanistes que nous qvons tenté de déstabiliser, afin de les remplacer, à travers des situations didactiques porteuses de conflits</page><page sequence="15">THE CONCEPT OF ALIVE BY PRESCHOOLERS 205 cognitifs, par une conception de la notion du vivant plus cohérente, celle de l'échange de l'organisme vivant avec le milieu. Les résultats montrent que les jeunes élèves peuvent comprendre les contradictions lorsque les données qui infirment leurs conceptions initiales sont présentées simultanément. Plus concrètement, lors du post test, les enfants du groupe expérimental se sont montrés capables d'intégrer le monde végétal dans la catégorie des objets vivants, d'abandonner le critère du mouvement lors de la distinction "vivant-non vivant", ainsi que de produire une argumentation plus fournie pour justifier l'appartenance des animaux à la catégorie du vivant.
