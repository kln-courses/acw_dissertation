<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS that it needs a reader also of wide experience to sift out the essentials; the young singer may well think that if so much has to be known, singing must be impossible until one is past it physically. The intention to say everything that can be said would be admirable in a definitive book on singing; but such a book is out of the question, and the most a writer can hope to do is to lay down principles on which the reader can graft his own detail. The instructions given here on every conceivable point so far obscure the major problems that the scheme of the book fails to take shape. Whether Mr. Scott is right in his basic approach to singing is debatable, though in this respect he is well supported by tradition. Apparently his method is to deal with the individual parts of the body in an endeavour to make a synthetic unity. Lips, soft palate and so on are discussed as if the conscious mind had cognizance of such things when it demands of the body a certain result. We speak by imitation, and no amount of manipulation on the body will give an Englishman a French accent, nor will conscious meddling with the throat assist it in its delicate job of finding the best position for resonance and at the same time produce the two or more notes that each of a rapidly changing vowel-chain seems to require. Since science of a sort has been called on to explain singing, it would be interesting to have the views of a neurologist on the advisability of trying to interfere between the conscious mind and the " end result ". H. O. Northern Indian Music. By Alain Danielou. Vol. II, pp. 248. (Halcyon Press, London, under the auspices of U.N.E.S.C.O., I954.) 30s. In I949 Christopher Johnson in London and Visva Bharati in Calcutta published the first volume of M. Danielou's 'Northern Indian Music '.1 The Halcyon Press now brings out the second volume and has reissued the first in a new jacket, conforming to that of the second and showing the author playing the North Indian type of vina. It is a pity that in the years between the publication of the first and second volumes the author apparently did not have an opportunity for revision. He would very likely have welcomed the chance of correcting some inaccuracies, fallacies and errors. Inaccuracies such as the mention of chapter 38 of the Benares edition of the ' Natyasastra ', which contains only 36 chapters, and the information that music is treated in chapters 28, 29 and 38, whereas in fact it occupies chapters 28-33 (Vol. I, p. I39, bibliography). Fallacies such as the division of the octave into sixty-six intervals (Vol. I, pp. 45-46): " The Indian history of music considers that a normal ear can easily perceive sixty-six distinct intervals within the compass of an octave . . . ", whereas in fact the number sixty-six, where it occurs, refers to the three times twenty-two srutis within the range of the three recognized octaves. Errors such as the strange notion that Brahmanism had been an underground movement for a thousand years and that then, emerging victoriously, it " wiped out Buddhism from the whole Indian continent in hardly more than a few decades" (Vol. I, p. i6). In fact, Brahmanism and Buddhism co-existed in India for more than fifteen hundred years. The last traces of the latter as an independent religion did not disappear before well into the Mohammedan period, after A.D. I200. It can still be found as a substratum of many forms of 1 Reviewed in Music &amp; LETTERS, June I950. 85</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC AND LETTERS popular religion, even among the Moslems of East Bengal. Throughout these long centuries we see them borrowing from one another, with the result that many a Hindu sect can hardly be distinguished from its Buddhist counterpart. Round about the seventh century of our era a strong Brahminical renaissance took place, which indeed succeeded in widening its domain by stages, resulting in the final disappearance of Buddhism as an independent religion, but after five or six centuries, not a few decades. In Nepal the two can still be found living side by side. This historical absurdity, however, propounded at the beginning of Vol. I, is unfortunately an essential component of M. Danielou's explana- tion of the theory of Indian music. Without Brahmanism victimized by persecutions the alleged disappearance of a primordial perfect system of music, closely resembling the late medieval system, is not explicable, and without the medieval scholastic elaborations M. Danielou's explana- tion of the early genesis of ragas and raginis in Vol. II is impossible. What Indian music really shows in the succession of theoretical texts that have come down to us is a modal system that had settled into its permanent and unshakable framework at an early date, possibly as early as the second century B.C. From then onwards scope for development existed only in further refinements within that frame. The consequence was a succession of more and more subtle analyses and an ever-deepening probing of emotional impulses. What M. Danielou tries to do is to explain the purely musical origin of this modal framework-a direct outcome of the scale as it developed in the different stages of Vedic liturgy-with the help of the purely emotional super-sophistications of the days of the Moghuls as surviving in the different schools established by famous musicians of those days. To each of the twenty-two srutis-i.e. tonal subdivisions of the octave-one out of five emotional qualities is ascribed (pathetic, tender, loving, etc). Each interval has a well-definable effect in accordance with the character of the Sruti which limits its size, measured against the stable and unchanging basic note of the scale, the Sa. Accidentals produce a change of emotional impact of the standard interval according to the nature of the new final sruti. This can be compared with a phenomenon in our musical practice. If our normal major third is felt to denote brightness, the lessening by "one sruti " would introduce an element of sadness. The effect of brightness would be increased if the major third were taken larger than its normal size in the course of a performance. In addition to this hairsplittingly detailed emotional analysis of each of the twenty-two possible tonal divisions, we find that the mode as a whole-built up as it is out of a kaleidoscopic combination of emotional shades-was felt to make a masculine or a feminine impression which, in course of time, gave rise to the term raga for the male and ragini for the female modal sequences. Once established, the process of personi- fication was carried to its logical conclusion, and so we find, from the fifteenth or sixteenth century onwards, often exquisitely beautiful paintings and strongly pictorial lines of poetry portraying those many and varied personages. Despite M. Danielou's claim that these late medieval tonal-emotional relationships are universally valid, we see that in fact there is a strong individual element in these ascriptions. This may easily be understood 86</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS if we recall the different opinions on colour sensations evoked by certain kinds of intervals. On p. I28 of Vol. II even the author's own Sanskrit quotations (not the translations) contradict his dogma, since of the three sets of lines of poetry describing the same raga the first and last depict a woman, the middle one a man. What are the results M. Danielou arrives at on these premises ? Firstly, that the original ragas were the pentatonic scales, on account of the unmixed quality of their intervals. " Because of their forceful character these pentatonic scales were known to ancient music as male ragas" (Vol. II, Introd., p. 2). Secondly, that the subsequent creation of hexatonic and pentatonic scales resulted in the birth of the raginis. If this were true, it would certainly bring order into the chaos of the North Indian ragas and raginis and enable us to establish a system different from but as useful as that devised in South India some two centuries ago. That system, however, bases itself on purely musical facts and not on subjective emotional effects. It recognizes seventy-two main ragas, divided into two parallel groups of thirty-six. The first thirty-six have a perfect, the second, otherwise completely similar group, an augmented fourth. These two groups of thirty-six are then subdivided according to a systematic progression of accidentals, somewhat like the increasing number of sharps and flats in our own system. M. Danielou's system, however, does not work, as there is no trace of the priority of pentatonic over heptatonic scales in any of the available theoretical texts. Bharata's seven suddha (pure) jatis, or primary modes, the basis of the whole system, are heptatonic. Pentatonality and hexa- tonality are mentioned as secondary characteristics and occur only in some of the eleven derived jatis. The most ancient text on the theory of music thus not only fails to consider pentatonic scales as primary, but does not even know the phenomenon raga, in the sense of mode with a well-defined emotional implication. Where the word raga occurs as in "jdtirdga " (' Natyasastra ', XXVIII, verse 35), it means the colouring of a jati by the skilful mixing of the available accidentals, an embryonic form of the later conception. Not before the tenth century does Matanga give the first exposition of raga as a distinct musical phenomenon, claiming that this had not been previously expounded either by Bharata or by his successors. Matanga's ragas, however, do not put the pentatonic scales first, but keep very close to the heptatonic jatis as given by Bharata. Later still we find the differentiation into male and female and the further consequences of this anthropomorphic tendency. In strong contrast to the decidedly unsound basis of M. Danielou's theoretical explanations is the practical material given in both volumes. He has studied Indian music for many years under a famous musician in Benares. His knowledge of technical matters is well founded and the many musical examples given on the strength of his practical knowledge are valuable, especially those in the volume under review. In view of the present cataclysm of Indian musical values it is important to possess a reliable record of the traditions of at least one of the recognized authoritative teachers of the beautiful classical music of India.
