<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues* Jeffrey W ieand / Cambridge, Massachusetts Generations of readers of Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion have wondered about what Hume intended the book to show. In trying to figure this out commentators have often identified Hume with one or another of the disputants in the dialogue: Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea.' Unfortunately, since all three of these characters say things with which Hume probably agreed, the dialogue itself seems to provide no conclusive evidence that Hume intended any of these characters as his spokesman. Commentators have accordingly turned to other sources. Most recent interpretations of the Dialogues have relied heavily on comparisons with Hume's other works, his letters, reports by Bos- well and others of Hume's conversations, and analysis of Cicero's De natura deorum, on which Hume's Dialogues is evidently based. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this; indeed, if the Dialogues is incompre- hensible without this sort of scholarship, the book may be a trope for its subject. For if Hume's contention is that we can discover little or nothing about the author of the universe from the study of his works and that only revelation may inform us of his nature and intentions, it would be fitting if Hume's intentions in the Dialogues could only be understood by appeal to outside sources. The design of the Dialogues would be as elusive as the design of the universe. Since it is unlikely that additional scholarly discoveries will shed light on Hume's intentions in the Dialogues, perhaps it is time, as they say, to return to the text. It seems to me, in fact, that the text supports the * I wish to thank Josef Stern, who first pointed out to me Philo's problems with revelation, for his helpful comments on a draft of this paper.

G. P. Morice (Austin, Tex., 1977). James Noxon takes exception to this identification in "Hume's Agnosticism," in Hume, a Collection of Critical Essays, ed. V. C.

I will argue that this identification is useful and correct and that it aids our understanding of some of the crucial arguments of the Dialogues. I do not think it can be denied that, at least on some occasions, Pamphilus speaks for Hume. The bulk of the Dialogues is the conversa- tion of Philo, Demea, and Cleanthes as related by Pamphilus to his friend Hermippus. This retelling is preceded by a short introduction in which Pamphilus defends the use of the dialogue, as opposed to the treatise, as a suitable literary vehicle for the topic of natural religion. There are, according to Pamphilus, three disadvantages connected with writing a dialogue: (1) A dialogue is unsuitable for presenting a system of thought, whereas a treatise is ideal. (2) The author of a dialogue, while he avoids "the appearance of author and reader,"3 is "apt to run into a worse inconvenience and convey the image of pedagogue and pupil." Platonic dialogues presumably fall prey to this "inconven- ience." (3) If the author tries to purge the dialogue of this didactic character and provide a balance among the interlocutors, he bores the reader and sacrifices "order, brevity, and precision." Nevertheless, Pamphilus says that there are two sorts of subjects amenable to treatment in a dialogue-those which are obvious but important and those which are so obscure and uncertain "that human reason can reach no fixed determination" about them. It turns out that natural religion is at once obvious and obscure-the existence of God is obvious; his nature is obscure to human reason. Now since Pamphilus is only reporting a conversation, it is odd that he should say any of this at all. He should tell Hermippus (the projected reader) why he thinks the conversation is worth reporting or why he is reporting it, not why the dialogue is the ideal literary form for writing about natural religion. (Similarly, it would be absurd for Phaedo to preface his recounting the events of Socrates' last day for Echecrates by arguing that the dialogue is the perfect literary form for treating the subject of immortality.) Of course, Pamphilus goes on to remind Hermippus that he had been very curious about the conversation and had pressed him to "enter into more exact detail of their reasonings and display those various systems which they advanced." But the proper way to satisfy Hermippus is simply to relate the conversation. A treatise could never serve in this capacity. The only person who had to 2 Charles Hendel, Studies in the Philosophy of David Hume (Princeton, N.J., 1925), pp. 306-9. 3 Dialogues, p. 127.

Hence it is entirely natural for a reader of the Dialogues to suppose that Pamphilus here is speaking for Hume. Pamphilus, then, should be regarded not only as the reporter of a con- versation but also as its author. The Dialogues present the views of Pamphilus on natural religion. Pamphilus reports the conversation in oratio recta; this makes it easier to think of him as an author, since no one could have remembered such a conversation so accurately. But Pamphilus maintains a low profile. He interrupts the narrative on only four occasions, not counting his concluding remarks. All of these interruptions are of the highest interest. The first two interruptions suggest from the beginning that what Philo says is not always to be taken at face value. Pamphilus discerns "an air of finesse" in Cleanthes' features "as if he had perceived some raillery or artificial malice in the reasonings of Philo" (p. 132). Later he says that Philo was proceeding "somewhat between jest and earnest, as it appeared to me" (p. 150). Both of these observations help to prepare the reader for Philo's revelation of his "unfeigned sentiments" in part 12 after Demea's departure. This departure is also recorded by Pamphilus in his own voice (p. 213). The other two passages where Pamphilus speaks for himself are of greater import. The first occurs in part 3, where he notes that Philo, following a crucial argument by Cleanthes, "was a little embarrassed and confounded; but, while he hesitated in delivering an answer, luckily for him, Demea broke in upon the discourse and saved his countenance" (p. 155). The second occurs at the very end of the dialogue-indeed it is the end of the dialogue. Pamphilus gives his opinion of the outcome of the conversation: "Cleanthes and Philo pur- sued not this conversation much farther; and as nothing ever made greater impression on me, than all the reasonings of that day; so I con- fess, that, upon a serious review of the whole, I cannot but think, that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth." Kemp Smith chalks up both of these remarks to Hume's desire to balance the Dialogues. 4 In his view, Philo is everywhere triumphant. Cleanthes' argument in part 3 misses the point of Philo's earlier objections, and this is no doubt one reason Philo is unable to reply to it. Thus, if the dramatic interest of the Dialogues is to be maintained, the reader must be led to suppose (wrongly) that there is really something to Cleanthes' position. 4 Kemp Smith, p. 65. 35</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion I do not think, however, that Kemp Smith is right about this. In the first place, Philo may really have no reply to Cleanthes' arguments in part 3. (I will return to this.) Second, if Kemp Smith is right, Hume's work will have fallen prey to two of the difficulties that, according to Pamphilus, typically beset dialogues. For Hume will have tried (artifi- cially) to balance the arguments of the characters - and he will have done so in part precisely by relying on the loyalty of a pupil (Pamphilus) to his pedagogue (Cleanthes). It seems unlikely that Hume would tumble into the very trap which he acknowledges at the outset. At first glance, a passage at the end of the introduction supports Kemp Smith's reading. Pamphilus reminds Hermippus, "The remark- able contrast in their characters still further raised your expectations; while you opposed the accurate philosophical turn of Cleanthes to the careless scepticism of Philo, or compared either of their dispositions with the rigid inflexible orthodoxy of Demea" (p. 128). Hume clearly intends this passage to create expectations in the reader; by reminding Hermippus of his earlier reactions, Pamphilus engenders in us expecta- tions of similar reactions. But if Pamphilus represents Hume, Hermip- pus ought to represent Hume's reader, in which case Hume is remind- ing us (or anyway his eighteenth-century English Protestant audience) what in fact our prejudices are - that we favor philosophical theology over what is, if not careless, then surely playful skepticism and that we favor both over (typically Catholic) appeals to traditio and authority. This is how things stack up at the beginning and, since it is also how they stack up at the end, there is no reason to suppose that these characterizations are merely dramatic devices. Is not Demea's position one of "rigid inflexible orthodoxy"? Is not Philo a "careless skeptic"? Does not Cleanthes give evidence of an "accurate philosophical turn"? This last question is not rhetorical and must be taken up again below. Ernest Mossner finds all of these characterizations deeply ironic.5 Indeed, he describes Pamphilus as "Hume's hitherto unsuspected mas- terstroke of ironic deception."6 Quite apart from whether Mossner was the first to suppose that the function of Pamphilus is ironic, his claim is far from established. Consider, for example, his argument that Pamphi- lus is used for purposes of what Mossner calls "reverse psychology": Pamphilus, that youthful herald of irony, had taken for granted in the prologue to the Dialogues that the being of a God is a truth "so obvious, so cer- tain" (p. 128), as to require no proof. This limitation of the debate to the attributes of a God is accepted without question by the three debaters at the 5 Mossner, pp. 6ff. 6 Ibid., p. 12. 36</page><page sequence="5">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues same time as it is ignored by them in practice. Thus the wary reader, who has schooled himself to be sceptical of every utterance of Pamphilus, is quite pre- pared to learn that in reality the argument to the being of a God is brought to the fore nearly equally with that to the attributes of a God.... The indisput- able fact is that the being of a God, Pamphilus to the contrary notwithstand- ing, is a major, if not the major, issue of the Dialogues. The cumulative effect of arguing this issue so frequently is to take on the ironical implication that the being of a God not only is not a self-evident truth but on the contrary is not rationally provable.7 This passage raises many questions. But the main thing to notice here is that Pamphilus never says (in the prologue, or anywhere else) (1) that the interlocutors do not discuss the existence of God and (2) that the reason they do not is that the existence of God is obvious. What Pamphilus says is that the existence of God is an appropriate subject for treatment in a dialogue precisely because it is obvious, important, and obscure. Moreover, even if the existence of God cannot be proved (Pamphilus never implied that it could be), all three of the interlocutors affirm that God exists. My own view is that Hume was trying to show in the Dialogues that there is a natural propensity to believe that God exists in the same way that there is a natural propensity to believe that the external world exists. In this sense, both God and the external world are obvious and certain and untouched by skepticism, despite the fact that their existence cannot be demonstrated.8 I have attacked the suggestions that Pamphilus's role in the Dialogues is merely dramatic or ironic; instead, I have tried to identify Pamphilus with Hume. A final objection remains to be considered. Pamphilus is able to relate the dialogue because he was its audience. The dialogue is in an important sense about education-the education of Pamphilus, which is both the first and the last subject discussed by the participants. Pamphilus then is the listener, the auditor, the student whose educa- tion is at stake. But in that case should not Pamphilus be identified with the readers of the Dialogues and not with its author? One answer to this question is that Hermippus already plays this role. But in any case Pamphilus can play both roles. The Pamphilus who listens to the conversation is a youth, the pupil of Cleanthes. The Pamphilus who is the author of the Dialogues is capable of thinking for himself. (There is no evidence to support Hendel's claim, however, that Pamphilus "has 7 Ibid., p. 14. 8 Clearly there is some irony in the Dialogues. The question is where and how much. Mossner might be right, and much of what Pamphilus says might be ironic. But in that case, much of what Philo says in pt. 12 must also be ironic. It seems to me, on the contrary, that Philo is ironical only in Demea's presence and that, when he is alone with Cleanthes, he can reveal his true feelings. I will return to this below. 37</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion reached the prime of life.")9 By listening to the conversation, Pamphilus actually completes his education. This accords well with Demea's view that natural religion is the last subject in which one should receive instruction: "None but a mind enriched with all the other sciences can safely be entrusted with it" (p. 130). Pamphilus says, "Nothing ever made greater impression on me, than all the reasonings of that day" (p. 228). This is the remark of a man who has had many opportunities to be impressed and who thinks that what impresses him will count for someone else. We will see later that there is a deeper reason that the idea that Pamphilus is at once author and audience is worth taking seriously. The fact that the education of Pamphilus is at stake is one reason that he is the measure of the dialogue. Although Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes may disagree about how reasonable it is to suppose that anyone really knows or could know what God is like, they all believe that God exists, all suppose that this belief is (in some sense) reason- able, and all take themselves to be referring to the same object with the word "God." But Pamphilus has (presumably) no particular views on these matters at all. How should he be taught, and what will the con- sequences be? Both Demea (at the outset) and Philo (at the end) seem to challenge Cleanthes' claim to be Pamphilus's teacher-Demea by recommending his own teaching methods, Philo by recommending skepticism directly to Pamphilus. While Pamphilus does not choose to endorse Philo's proposal, he nevertheless learns a good deal from Philo. ("Pamphilus" incorporates a "phil"; he is the little phil or philo.) But if the education of Pamphilus is completed by Philo, why does Pamphilus not embrace Philo's principles? This question, I think, is the key to the Dialogues and will occupy our attention for the remainder of this essay. Although Philo attacks Cleanthes' argument from design (as pre- sented in pt. 2) throughout the dialogue, he ends up (in pt. 12) saying that something very much like this argument is valid. Supposing there were a God [says Philo], who did not discover himself immediately to our senses; were it possible for him to give stronger proofs of his existence, than what appear on the whole face of nature? [P. 215] That the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of art is evident; and, according to all the rules of good reasoning, we ought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes have a proportional analogy. But as there are also considerable differences, we have reason to suppose a proportional difference in the causes, and, in particular, ought to attribute a much higher degree of power and energy to the supreme cause than 9 Hendel, p. 398. 38</page><page sequence="7">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues any we have ever observed in mankind. Here then the existence of a Deity is plainly ascertained by reason. [Pp. 216-17] Philo thus admits that there is an analogy between the adjustment of means and ends in nature or the universe and the adjustment of means and ends in human artifacts and that, on the basis of this analogy, it is reasonable to suppose that the universe was designed by an intelligent creator. It does not follow, however, that Philo embraces the argument from design in the precise way it was formulated by Cleanthes in part 2. As other commentators have argued,10 the problem with Cleanthes' argument in part 2 is that it is presented as a scientific argument, whereas what Philo concedes is merely that, if you observe the order and structure of the universe - of the system of nature and its parts - its adjustment of means and ends will lead you immediately and ineluc- tably to suppose that it was created by a deity. But this is in substance the argument of Cleanthes in part 3: The declared profession of every reasonable sceptic is only to reject abstruse, remote and refined arguments; to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature; and to assent, wherever any reasons strike him with so full a force, that he cannot, without the greatest violence, prevent it. Now the arguments for natural religion are plainly of this kind; and nothing but the most perverse, obstinate metaphysics can reject them. Consider, anatomize the eye: Survey its structure and contrivance; and tell me, from your own feel- ing, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation. [P. 154] Had Philo an objection to this he surely would have advanced it. But it is here that Pamphilus reports that "Philo was a little embarrassed and confounded." Demea steps in, and we hear no more from Philo until well into part 4. We may assume, then, that Philo has no reply to Cleanthes here because he is in general agreement with him. Thus Pamphilus's interjection, though not, perhaps, without dramatic value, underscores the fact that the groundwork for Philo's position in part 12 is laid by Cleanthes in part 3. But while it is clear that Philo thinks it is reasonable to believe God exists given the order and structure of the world, it is not clear what sort of God this is supposed to be. Philo may merely be suggesting that something (=x) caused the purposive order in the world, and we call this x "God." Thus all we would know about God is that he is the thing, x, that is this cause. But if the analogy is carried further, we may also 10 See Nelson Pike's commentary on the Dialogues in his own edition of the work (Indianapolis, 1980), sec. 4. 39</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion suppose that this God must possess a mind or intelligence to some extent similar to that of human beings. At times Philo seems to stress the remoteness of the analogy; the proposition he considers at the end is "that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence" (p. 227). Similarly, he claims that the atheist must admit that "the principle which first arranged, and still maintains, order in this universe" prob- ably bears "some remote inconceivable analogy to the oeconomy of human mind and thought" (p. 218). If this is all we can accept, it is not very comforting-we must admit an "inconceivable" analogy between a "principle" and certain human and nonhuman operations. It is not obvious that this even makes any sense. How can we accept an analogy that is inconceivable? If it is inconceivable, how do we even see that it is remote? What sense does it make to say that a principle can "arrange" and maintain something or that such a principle can sensibly be com- pared with operations of nature? But if Philo does not intend to under- mine the very point he is trying to make, he may be suggesting that the atheist need only affirm that a minimal God "probably" exists. Else- where, however, the analogy seems much stronger-"the works of nature," according to Philo, "bear a great analogy to the productions of art," and God bears "a considerable resemblance" to "mind or thought" (p. 217). Whatever Philo thinks, the fact that the clever Philo trips all over himself when he tries to say something positive about natural theology seems to indicate that Cleanthes' confusions may at least in part be attributed to the difficulty of arguing positive theses in natural religion and not to a lack of philosophical ability. The conversation ends with Philo's defense of philosophical skepti- cism in natural religion. For Philo, God is in some sense like a human mind or intelligence. Beyond this, the skeptic holds, we can know nothing through reason about God's attributes. But if we can know nothing about the nature of God through human reason, it is reason- able to believe that God will somehow reveal himself to us; otherwise, we cannot explain why a powerful being like God would fail to endow us with the power to discern his nature and purposes without providing some other, more direct, means of coming to know these things. On the other hand, the person who supposes that he should be able to figure out what God is like through reason is bound to be disappointed, and his disappointment may easily lead to atheism or at least to a rejection of Christianity. For Philo, then, skepticism about the claims of human reason to know God is a way of showing the necessity of revelation. "To be a philosophical sceptic is," he says, "in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian; a 40</page><page sequence="9">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues proposition which I would willingly recommend to the attention of Pamphilus" (p. 228). Why does this fail to impress Pamphilus? Why does Pamphilus con- clude by saying that Demea's principles are less probable than Philo's but that Cleanthes' principles "approach still nearer to the truth"? It is important to notice, first, that Pamphilus's remark does not count as an endorsement or rejection of anyone's views. It is not true, as Penelhum says, that, "Cleanthes is stated, in the concluding sentence, to be the victor."" Pamphilus merely rank orders the prin- ciples of the three disputants; he does not say that one of them is right and the others are wrong. Indeed, in Greek "Pamphilus" means "all- loving"; he likes all three positions, and finds something worthy in each. 2 This implies, it seems to me, that Hume wants us to see that there is an element of truth in what all three of the characters say. If Pamphilus represents Hume, the dispute between Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo is an internal dispute, a conflict in Hume's own soul. Just as Hume is the author as well as the audience and arbiter of this conflict, so Pamphilus is at once the author/reporter of the dialogue and its audience/arbiter. What is at stake, then, is really Hume's own education. But if there is some truth to all three positions, why is Demea absent from the crucial discussion in part 12? Pamphilus ends part 11 as follows: "Thus Philo continued to the last his spirit of opposition, and his censure of established opinions. But I could observe, that Demea did not at all relish the latter part of the discourse; and he took occasion soon after, on some pretence or other, to leave the company" (p. 213). When Demea is.gone, Cleanthes says to Philo, "Your spirit of contro- versy, joined to your abhorrence of vulgar superstition, carries you strange lengths, when engaged in an argument; and there is nothing so sacred and venerable, even in your own eyes, which you spare on that occasion" (p. 214). Philo is then prepared to reveal his "unfeigned senti- ments on this subject" (p. 219). Thus the excesses of Philo's skepticism are really directed against Demea. In this respect Philo behaves like Hume himself. For although Hume attacks Pyrrhonian skepticism in the first Enquiry, he finds a use for it and for academic skepticism: "The I Penelhum, p. 191. 12 This may not be all that Hume had in mind in naming this character "Pamphilus." The word "pamphlet" first appears in fourtheenth-century Anglo-Latin as "panfletus" and later in English as "pamflet." According to the Oxford English Dictionary, these words are derived from a thirteenth-century erotic poem evidently named after its author, "Pamphilus." "Students at the University of Paris," the OED says, "were rebuked because they preferred this erotic production to more edifying reading." In writing on the sensitive subject of natural religion, Hume may have shielded himself with a name linked both to risque subjects and censorship. 41</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion greater part of mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dog- matical in their opinions; and while they see objects only on one side, and have no idea of any counterpoising argument, they throw them- selves precipitately into the principles to which they are inclined; nor have they any indulgence for those who entertain opposite senti- ments."'3 Academic and Pyrrhonian skepticism are useful in combating this dogmatism: "If any of the learned be inclined, from their natural temper, to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tincture of Pyrrhonism might abate their pride, by showing them, that the few advantages, which they may have attained over their fellows, are but inconsider- able, if compared with the universal perplexity and confusion, which is inherent in human nature."'4 But Cleanthes is not guilty of dogmatic haughtiness and obstinacy. Hence with him the skeptic becomes truly Humean; he emphasizes the limitations of human understanding while at the same time acknowledging the unavoidable propensities of human nature. The question remains, however, why Cleanthes' principles seem to Pamphilus to approach most nearly to the truth. I want to suggest two possible answers to this question. First, it is possible that Hume wanted to show the futility of Philo's defense of skepticism. To see this we must reconsider why Philo thinks it is reasonable to believe that God exists. Philo agrees with Cleanthes that there is, after all, an analogy between nature and the works of human contrivance: both exhibit an adjust- ment of means to ends that is characteristically the product of design. When we notice this analogy, we cannot help but suppose that an intel- ligent God is the creator of the world. "No man can deny the analogies between the effects: to restrain ourselves from inquiring concerning the causes is scarcely possible" (p. 217). To paraphrase Cleanthes, when we consider the order and structure of the world, the idea of a contriver immediately flows upon us with the force of a sensation. Philo's point, then, is partly a psychological one: belief in God is, for a person who reflects on the world (a "man of letters") wholly natural and unavoid- able. But the problem is that it should also be natural and unavoidable to wish (like Cleanthes) to pursue the analogy further. Who will stop, having been struck with the reasonableness of God's existence, at this conclusion and refuse to try to figure out what God must be like? If the point of Philo's argument throughout the Dialogues is to show that we must restrain just this propensity, it must be a powerful propensity 13 Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals, 3d ed. (Oxford, 1975), p. 161. 14 Ibid. 42</page><page sequence="11">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues indeed, and it may be futile to try to suppress it. But there is a more serious consequence. If skepticism about the nature of God is "the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian," while (conversely) to allow the propensity to remain unchecked is to invite atheism, then agreeing with Philo is tantamount to agreeing that God has endowed us with a propensity to seek knowledge of him through reason-a propensity which, if unchecked, leads us to the con- viction that he does not exist. This is surely an unacceptable result. A second line of objection to Philo's argument also points out inter- nal difficulties in Philo's position. According to Philo, an acknowledg- ment of the limitations of natural religion (i.e., reason) leads to a renewed emphasis on revelation, and revelation is, of course, the foun- dation of Christianity. But revelation is also constrained by the limita- tions of reason. What will such a revelation be like? How will it be possible? The same limitations that make it impossible to discern through reason what God is like or to apply our human concepts of justice, benevolence, knowledge, and so on to God ought also to make it impossible for us to perceive such a God directly. If God is, as Philo maintains, incomprehensible, how will revelation of any sort be pos- sible? A revelation must express the incomprehensible in terms that human beings can comprehend. But what human beings can comprehend can always be explained otherwise than through appeal to revelation. Cleanthes makes precisely this point: Suppose, therefore, that an articulate voice were heard in the clouds, much louder and more melodious than any which human art could ever reach: Sup- pose, that this voice were extended in the same instant over all nations, and spoke to each nation in its own language and dialect: Suppose, that the words delivered not only contain a just sense and meaning, but convey some instruc- tion altogether worthy of a benevolent Being, superior to mankind: Could you possibly hesitate a moment concerning the cause of this voice? And must you not instantly ascribe it to some design or purpose? Yet I cannot see but all the same objections (if they merit that appelation) which lie against the system of theism, may also be produced against this inference. Might you not say, that all conclusions concerning fact were founded on experience: That when we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and thence infer a man, it is only the resemblance of the effects, which leads us to con- clude that there is a like resemblance in the cause: But that this extraordinary voice, by its loudness, extent, and flexibility to all languages, bears so little analogy to any human voice, that we have no reason to suppose any analogy in their causes: And consequently, that a rational, wise, coherent speech pro- ceeded, you knew not whence, from some accidental whistling of the winds, not from any divine reason or intelligence? You see clearly your own objec- 43</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion tions in these cavils; and I hope too, you see clearly, that they cannot possibly have more force in the one case than in the other. [Pp. 152-53] Several points can be drawn from this passage. (1) If Philo would be unwilling to count this "voice from the clouds" as revelation (i.e., as an effect the cause of which is God), what would he ever be willing to count as revelation? What could ever satisfy him? For (2) no matter how fantastic the alleged revelation, there will always be some way of explaining the event according to natural processes. (In this case, Cleanthes suggests the "whistling of the winds.") Moreover, (3) it is impossible to understand the voice in the clouds as coming from a deity unless one supposes-as Cleanthes has supposed all along-that the deity is in certain respects similar to human beings. Without some sup- position of this sort, there would be no grounds for supposing that it is God, and not some other creature, devil, or natural process that is the cause of the voice. Intelligent speech, of course, is characteristic of human beings and so far as we know of nothing else, and it would doubtless be possible for God to reveal himself in a less characteristically human way. But Philo says that skepticism is "the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian," and the Christian revelation is perhaps the most anthropomorphic revelation possible. Christ is not compared to a human being; he is one. On Philo's principles, this is not something we should be able to comprehend, let alone assent to. Hence, in view of the argument between Philo and Cleanthes, I think Pamphilus sees the following problem with Philo's skeptical prin- ciple: if reason prohibits the drawing of analogies between human beings and God, revelation will never draw this analogy for us, since reason weighs the claims of revelation as well. It would be better to acknowledge that we have a more or less natural propensity for drawing such analogies and that to suppress this propensity is at the same time to suppress our willingness to accept revelation, in partic- ular, the Christian revelation. Revelation must be something which human beings can understand, and it is Cleanthes more than anyone else in the Dialogues who is prepared to understand (and to understand the need for) such a revelation. (Demea probably accepts revelation because other people have told him to.) This does not mean that there are no dangers in Cleanthes' principles and that we should indulge our desire to reason out what God is like; the point is only that, in the end, his principles are, from the point of view of Christianity, preferable to Philo's. The Christian revelation requires both a desire to inquire about what God is like and a willingness to think of man as made in his 44</page><page sequence="13">Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues image and Christ as made in the image of man. Hume helps us to see this through Pamphilus's last remarks. 45</page></plain_text>
