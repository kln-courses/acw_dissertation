PRICE 3921 Laurel Canyon Boulevard Studio City, CA 91604 ABSTRACT In 1983 an interview with Juan Quezada's mother was videotaped in the course of making a documentary about Juan and his ceramic technique. Though this in- terview was not included in the documentary, Dofia Paulita's comments were helpful in illuminating some of the events in the past that have influenced this remarkable man and his art. Three of the themes related in her anecdotes are de- veloped here: (1) Juan's artistic talent emerged at a young age; (2) he grew up in a poor household that his mother struggled at times to hold together; and (3) Juan has had to overcome a tendency toward shyness as a consequence of his artistic success. RESUMEN En 1983, se filmd una entrevista con la madre de Juan Quezada durante la realizacidn de un documental sobre Juan y su ticnica de cerdmica. Aunque esta entrevista no fue incluida en el documental, los comentarios de Doiia Paulita fueron de gran utilidadpara comprender algunos de los eventos que influyeron en el desarrollo de este notable hombre y su arte. Tres de los temas contenidos en sus andcdotas se desarrollan aquf: (1) el talento arttstico de Juan y su man- ifestacidn desde edad temprana; (2) el ambiente de pobreza en el que creci6 Juan, en el cual su mamd luchaba a veces por mantener unida a lafamilia; y (3) el efecto del edxito artistico de Juan en su timidez y su tendencia a la soledad. In May 1983, I went to Mata Ortiz on the last of several trips my crew and I had made in conjunction with videotaping a documentary about Juan Quezada and his pottery style. The focus of our interest as filmmakers up to that time, of course, had been Juan and his art. However, it became increasingly apparent from observing him on and off over the course of a number of months that closeness with his family was a pil- lar of his life. He was never separated from them - at work, during his free time, or while on tour in the United States. It was clear that he was most com- fortable in their midst, even at the risk of having a pot damaged or an elbow bumped while he was painting. Consequently, as videotaping progressed we consciously widened the field of view in order to include more family mem- bers and his interaction with them. One of the special moments during this particular trip was an interview with Juan's mother, then in her sixties, who agreed to sit in front of the camera and talk about her recollections of her family's past. Dofia Paulita Celado de Quezada (Figure 1) received our group - the video crew, accompanied by Juan and several of his children - in front of her house in the main part of town. Dofia Paulita proved to be an easy interview subject and took no time at 131</page><page sequence="2">132 PRICE Figure 1. Doia Paulita holding carved eagle (wood). Photo by William F. Price. all settling into the conversation without being distracted by the camera. She sat on a bench in the shade of a large mulberry tree, her back against the house wall, and we arranged ourselves on the ground in front of her. It was a beautiful spring morning. Her garden was bright with flowers, a warm breeze blew, and birds chirped. Dofia Paulita had on a simple blue dress and blue canvas shoes. Her hair, in the late stages of turning white, was tucked in at the back in a practical fashion. Her hands were alternately folded in her lap and brought to her face to cover her mouth when she grinned, a familiar gesture among women in Mexican villages. She wore glasses, a nod to moder- nity, but showed no leaning toward excess in the way of jewelry or other props. The lines in her face revealed a life spent confronting the sun. A trim, short woman, she sat comfortably while we talked. Though our interview lasted quite some time, her posture remained erect, the unspoken statement of a body made strong by years of physical activity yet still in good health. Her eyes were bright as she answered our questions about her family.</page><page sequence="3">Through a Mother's Eyes 133 The interview was in fact a conversation, our questions and comments in- tended to prompt her rather than to probe. In guiding the conversation we sometimes asked questions to which we already knew the answers, in order to get her point of view. Dofia Paulita's words flowed smoothly and quietly, and the events she recounted had an impact of their own that affected those of us sitting there with her. We gained insight into the family and the way of life that generated her notable son. And we heard first-hand about some of the condi- tions of life in northern Mexico for rural people living their lives during the middle of the twentieth century. The interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. Certain events in the family's history have been noted by Spencer Mac- Callum (1979). We know that Juan's parents arrived in Mata Ortiz in 1941, migrating from the small village of Tutuaca, Chihuahua, some ten hours to the south by road. The family included four children at the time, Juan being the youngest (MacCallum 1979:68). Juan's father, Don Jose, in the manner typi- cal of rural Mexican men adept at many skills, had supported the family in a variety of ways. This included making trade journeys once a year back to Tutuaca, a trip with pack animals often requiring a month and sometimes more (MacCallum 1979:70). Later, he would work seasonally as a bracero in the United States, leaving Juan's mother in charge of the family for long periods (MacCallum 1979:70). Juan's uncles on his father's side were talented men who lived by their hands. They had been Tutuaca's "tanners, cobblers, har- ness makers, millers, carpenters, cabinet makers" (MacCallum 1979:70). His mother was from the nearby village of San Lorenzo, which had been the site of a potterymaking tradition lasting into this century. Pottery manufac- ture there, however, was in decline by the time she grew up. Dofia Paulita's older sister and grandmother had been able to make pottery, though she herself never learned. Thus, while they were not artists, both of Juan's parents came from families possessed of artisans' talents and skills - skills born of the need to survive the economic and material realities of their place and time. Dofia Paulita and her husband eventually migrated to Mata Ortiz with the elderly couple who had raised Don Jose. Having seen this part of Chihuahua many years earlier during the Mexican Revolution, this old man, who was in fact Don Jose's uncle, decided to return there with his wife to raise cattle (MacCallum 1979:71). Don Jose and Dofia Paulita, along with their four chil- dren, agreed to accompany them. Our conversation with Dofia Paulita evolved in an unstructured manner, moving easily from topic to topic. Three themes would emerge as we talked: (1) that Juan's artistic talents became apparent at a young age; (2) that the fam- ily had been very poor, causing Dofia Paulita at times to struggle to keep it to- gether; and (3) that Juan has always been a "loner" and has had to overcome this shyness as a consequence of his notoriety.</page><page sequence="4">134 PRICE I have translated Dofia Paulita's comments into English and otherwise edited the interview transcript very little, except to add a name here or a defini- tion there for clarity. The only structure I have imposed is to arrange blocks of her comments around these three themes, starting with her recollections of Juan's youngest years in Mata Ortiz. Because more than one interviewer was participating, I have used the fol- lowing conventions: "Comment" or "C" to indicate our prompt, and "Dofia Paulita" or "P" for her response. Comment: Have you always lived in Mata Ortiz? Dofia Paulita: Yes, since I brought them here as youngsters. I had four small children. C: How old was Juan when you moved to Mata Ortiz? P: He was about one. He was still nursing. C: And Juan started school here? P: He started school here and he studied here, but he didn't care to finish. C: Is there just grade school here in Mata Ortifz? P: Now there is secundaria [seventh through ninth grades]. C: Yes. P: But then, when they were in school, there wasn't secundaria, just grade school. C: But he liked... P: He wanted to work at something else. He wasn't happy in school. He wanted, for example, to go into the hills and cut firewood to make a living.., .so that he wouldn't have to stay in school. He didn't like it. He just mostly didn't like it. And it was easier for him to cut firewood and sell it than to be stuck in school. C: He worked a long time selling firewood, didn't he? P: Yes. C: Is that how he came to know the hills and the mountains and the archaeological ruins? P: He used to bring firewood and.., .do you know what he really liked to do? Bring quiotes [roasted agave stalks, a local delicacy]. He would leave early in the morn- ing and spend the whole day and then come back in the evening with a bunch of quiotes which he would sell to make money. Even today, Juan still finds pleasure in these activities from his childhood. I have yet to visit him in the springtime when, at some point, he did not take time to harvest quiotes. In fact, he is always happy to take a drive into the hills - to go hunting, to check on his livestock, to gather materials for making pottery, to look for petroglyphs - for whatever reason. It is on these occasions that I have seen him most relaxed and at ease. He is a person who is genuinely at home in the countryside.</page><page sequence="5">Through a Mother's Eyes 135 C: How is it that he has found other means of making a living? Has he been more inde- pendent? P: [Pensive] Uh huh ... C: Later, as an adult, did he work for the railroad? P: Yes. Yes he did. C: How many years did he do that? P: He worked for the railroad about five years and then he left it and started to dis- cover how to make a living [with pottery]. He didn't want to continue with the rail- road, and he started to work and search for that thing [how to make pottery] all alone.., .looking and searching and.., .until he found it by himself; nobody told him, "Look, do it this way or that other way." He found out for himself, as if some- one was telling him, "Look, do this and that." C: Regarding art in general, has he always been interested in painting? P: Yes, he used to paint, and he made things like airplanes and paintings and little trucks and, well, anything that occurred to him. C: And drawing? P: Drawing yes .., .he was naturally very good at drawing. C: Did he draw on the walls? P: He drew on the walls of his room [pointing behind the wall where she was sitting]. He would invent and draw airplanes. He would draw whatever came to him and then he would erase them and start drawing again. C: How old was Juan when you moved to this house? P: He was about 12 years old. We learn that by the age of 12, Juan had begun to regularly express his ar- tistic nature. MacCallum notes that Juan "would draw and paint on the walls for hours at a time. His paints were those which he had made himself. When he had covered the walls, he would clean them off with newspapers soaked in kerosene and start over again" (MacCallum 1979:46). Juan's ability to express himself in art was not limited to these two-dimensional murals. His mother has managed to save a number of carved objects, delicately shaped in wood, bone, and cow horn, from this period in his life. She also has kept and framed several of his early paintings. It is evident that Dofia Paulita's watchful support has been significant in the development of Juan's art. She may have been his biggest fan. The attention she chose to pay to her son's early artistic endeavors no doubt provided a form of encouragement that endured long past his child- hood. When I first met Juan in 1979 I can recall being struck by his keen interest in the area's Precolumbian past. He was as aware as any amateur archaeologist of the prehistoric content of the Casas Grandes region. He knew what tools and resources earlier peoples had employed, based on what they had left be-</page><page sequence="6">136 PRICE hind, and he also knew how to make and use many of these items. I disco- vered, for example, that Juan could quite effectively manufacture chipped stone arrow points, a craft that many buffs dabble in but few are able to master. One afternoon as we bounced over the plains in his pickup truck he ab- ruptly stopped, far from the nearest road, and pointed out a low place, scarcely visible about a half-mile away, where ancient farmers had constructed a series of parallel catchments to slow and utilize runoff water in their fields. The land had long since reverted to desert scrub, and erosion had taken its toll, but his eye was keen. He had obviously walked many old trails and given considera- ble thought to interpreting these ancient ways. This fascination with the past had been engendered in Juan's formative years as he roamed the hillsides that, in effect, had been his school. It was both as natural and as rare as any young boy's passion for history. This was the creative mind, or la cabeza, as his mother put it, that eventually would turn to the mastery of pottery. Juan Quezada's independent reinvention of potterymaking was a truly re- markable accomplishment. One cannot help but be impressed by the uncom- monness of a curiosity so intense that he not only gave thought and attention to this aspect of the distant past, but also was moved to try to duplicate it. There are a half-dozen separate steps involved in manufacturing ceramics from natu- ral materials, as Juan does, and countless significant details. First, the clay has to be prospected and mined. Then it is ground and moistened before it can be used. The shaping of the vessel is a major step that includes a number of possi- ble variations. Painting and decorating are complicated as well, considering that one needs to first gather and prepare pigments and brushes, and then find the correct strokes to apply them. The clay is often burnished, either before or after firing, involving yet another tool and another technique. Next are the variables involved in firing the vessel: Where? When? With what fuel? Shielded from the fire or unshielded? For how long? The complexity of this entire process is significant, as are the number of possible wrong turns along the path of rediscovery. Finding workable methods for each step required years of time and numerous attempts. Keep in mind that this does not take into account the inventor's artistic ability, but only his intellectual aptitude at solving the technical riddles of manufacture. While Juan's ambition and ingenuity allowed him to create a successful formula for making pottery, it is his intrinsic talent that led him to finish his ollas with thin walls, exacting symmetry, and striking decorations. Thus, each of his pieces, besides its visually pleasing appearance, serves as a reminder of the many trials and failures that were necessary as Juan taught himself. In fact, this learning process is an evolutionary one, as even today he continues to experiment and refine his methods. It is appropriate to recall that Juan had no books or teachers to guide him, no libraries or active potters to go to for assistance. The manufacture of utilita- rian clayware had ceased in this region a generation earlier, and the colorful</page><page sequence="7">Through a Mother's Eyes 137 pottery associated with the ancient Casas Grandes culture had not been pro- duced since Precolumbian times. Juan says that many of his early efforts ended in disappointment and frustration. He credits the period in his life while he was working for the railroad and immediately after with affording him the time and the means of support to initially pursue his curiosity. Traveling around the Chihuahua countryside as a section hand, the main clues he used to keep his experiments on the right path were potsherds from the ground under his feet. Elsewhere (MacCallum 1979:24), it has been noted that Juan's rediscov- ery of pottery manufacture is an intellectual accomplishment that "ranks with such feats as that of Sequoyah, the unlettered Cherokee who, early in the 19th century, invented Cherokee script," that is, a new alphabet. This was no small attainment for an "unlettered" man, or for that matter, for anyone. Though such comparisons probably embarrass Juan, it is nonetheless worth remem- bering that his quest, too, was conceptually large in scope and took years to carry out. Learning how to make these objects was an involved, time-consum- ing task, just as it surely was for those who originally discovered and perfected potterymaking centuries ago. Our conversation with Dofia Paulita turned to the years in Juan's life when his father was spending time as a laborer in the United States. After the Mexi- can Revolution of 1910 the vast ranches, or haciendas, of Chihuahua were broken up into ejidos, or communal land entitlements, which gave local vil- lages the authority to administer the distribution and use of their own lands. Under this system, resident families were allocated farming and grazing land for their personal use. This land could be cultivated or grazed by the same fam- ily year after year, but it could not be sold outright because ownership rested with the village. People moving into a village at a subsequent time would not automatically have had access to ejido land, as it was already allocated. They would have had to wait until, for one reason or another, for example through marriage or abandonment, land became available under the rules of the sys- tem. This was the situation for the Quezadas when they migrated from Tutuaca, leaving Don Jose no choice in the meantime but to find work where he could. The fact that he periodically made this hazardous journey north indicates that the family was having difficulty making a living through their efforts at home. With only limited land available for cultivation, and most of that not ir- rigated, the inhabitants of Mata Ortiz were, as they are today, largely at the mercy of local weather in their farming and ranching activities. Over the years the men have usually entered the outside cash economy either by taking jobs with the railroad that runs through the region, by working in one of the lumber mills that have appeared from time to time, or, as in Don Jose' s case, by going to the U.S. in search of better wages, though at some personal risk. The following story took place during Don Jose's absence on one of these</page><page sequence="8">138 PRICE journeys. It reveals a direction that fate might have taken Juan's life and career, had his mother not intervened. C: And your husband...how has he made a living? He has farmed and he also has cat- tle, right? P: Yes, he has a few cows, a few. And back then when he was younger he used to leave us and go to the United States. That's why [the children] struggled, because he used to leave to work there and we stayed here, and they helped me as they could. They kept us alive and [my husband] was there working until he could send us money, which at times he sent and other times he didn't do so well and he couldn't. And so... and now, well, he has his little rancho up there [pointing to the distant hills] with his animals, and he farms. During the long periods when Don Jos6 was away, Juan and his siblings helped keep food on the table by taking odd jobs and by selling things that they gathered or fashioned: firewood, wild honey, quiotes, and Juan's handmade curios. C: Do you have the hope that Juan's children will also carry on the work that he has started here? P: Well, I hope so. Someone among them has to turn out like him. C: An artist as well. P: Of a good mind, because in spite of not having gone on in school, my son.., .who knows how it came about that his mind was capable of doing this? C: Coming up with something very original? P: Right. C: Very original. P: He was very small when one day a man came by from.., .where was that [asking Juan]? Dublin? From Dublin [a town near Nuevo Casas Grandes]? I was alone. Jos6 was in the U.S. at the time and the man showed up, and this one [Juan] was in his room. He used to stay in there alone like that to paint, to study, to... whatever. And I said to him, "Come on. Come out of there. Don't stay hidden in there." And the man arrived and then he said to me, "Where is Juanito?" Because he called Nicolis [Juan's younger brother] "Mi Pistolero" and he used to pressure this one [Juan] because he had a good mind. And he said to me, "You poor thing. How do you manage alone with these kids?" And surely out of pity, he saw how I was and he brought me groceries every two weeks since one of my daughters worked with him, with them. And he came and he found him [Juan] shut in his room. And on one occasion when he came [Juan] had a beautiful painted airplane made of wood and some big cats that he used to make of bone with fat necks that we used to sell. Everything that he made we sold. He was little, like Junior [Juan's son] there. That's how he was. And ifelt pity for him. I used to say to him, "My poor little boy. Why do you stay shut in your room?" "Leave me alone, Mamai," he told me,</page><page sequence="9">Through a Mother's Eyes 139 "Leave me." Here in this room is where he used to stay [pointing behind her], and it was all painted. And I went and peeked. "Don't tell them where I am, Mama.." Dofia Paulita's account ran in an uninterrupted soliloquy for some time. In the process of relating it she became emotionally involved in the events, and the distant look in her eyes revealed that she was, for moments at a time, more connected to the past than to the present. In her unselfconscious telling of the story she sometimes repeated herself, as if she were taking pleasure in recal- ling the events, not wanting to hurry past them. P: And on that occasion the man came. It was in the living room, not here. And he came and he saw him. "By God, Ma'am you don't know what you have here. This boy is an artist! You don't recognize what he is doing." And then he said to me, "Give him to me. I'll take him to Mexico City. I'll put him in a course, so that this boy can take care of you one day, and he will really treat you well." And then I started to cry. Imagine it. Think about it. "How?" I said to him. "I can't give you my son. I can't," I said, "Thank you." And he came about three times. One time he didn't want to come in. He stood over there [pointing to the corner of her small front yard], and I talked to him there. He was saying, "Look, Ma'am. Let your son go. Give him to me. You're alone." "No," I said, "I am hoping that my husband will return one of these days." Because one time he disappeared over there and he didn't write and he didn't write. He was in jail...how was he going to write? And [the man] was telling me, "Look, Ma'am, I assure you that this boy, if we take him to Mexico City, I'll take responsibility for him. You won't owe me a thing. I will send him to school. Just give him to me... for yourself, not for me... to give him training." Well, no, if you can imagine it, I didn't want to. I decided no, no, no, and nobody was going to change my mind. And he would say to me, "Listen, this boy in time is going to be a great artist, because he has a very good mind. And I don't know," he said, "what is going to happen but he is going to be very good." And now I am re- membering [this incident]. What do you think? By now, those of us sitting there with her, including Juan, were caught up in the emotion of her story. Her question came suddenly, and for a moment it was difficult to articulate a response. When words eventually emerged they seemed inadequate. C: [Pause] Very interesting. P: The thing is that he saw .., .didn't he? ... how [Juan] was. Yes, since he came often and I saw him there, well, he was coming to convince me to give him that boy, to give him schooling, so that he would take care of me. Not for him; so that [I] would know what this boy had. And no, how could I give him up? No, it would have been too much ... don't you see?...</page><page sequence="10">140 PRICE C: Yes, of course. P: ... to tell him, "take him." No, I managed with them during very painful times, but they grew up with me. [Long pause] I managed for long periods with them by my- self. In the 1950s this region was even more geographically and economically isolated than it is today. Located away from the seats of power - Mexico City and Chihuahua, the state capital - and relatively poor in natural resources, especially water, it is situated in a vast, anonymous area between the United States border and the Mexican interior to the south. Though beautiful, it is far from being a land of abundance, and it provides only a survival-level subsis- tence for many of its rural inhabitants. While Juan's father made the choice to travel north across the border in search of greater opportunity, Dofia Paulita stayed behind with the children, selling what they could make or gather, wait- ing for the money he was occasionally able to send, and hoping for his return. The identity of the stranger who came calling in those years remains un- known, but the significance of his visits was clear: he had recognized Juan's particular talent for changing what he touched with his hands into art. There is no doubt that Dofia Paulita had little trouble turning down his requests to take her son away. However, the sentiment with which she told the story that day was palpable. She still harbored deep feelings as a result of her decision, which she felt denied Juan the possibility of a big-city education and the chance to go to art school. (Note: Recent investigation has located the man who first noticed Juan. He is Oscar Beall Orozco of Colonia Dublin, Chihuahua. In the 1940s and '50s he and his family operated a lumber mill in Nuevo Casas Grandes and he visited Mata Ortiz to recruit workers.) On the other hand, by her sheer will, she held the family together during what must have been the hardest years when her husband was away working. Being poor was a constant challenge; having the family physically separated made things even more difficult by stretching the limits of hope. With Don Jose gone - and, due to the hazards of his situation, not knowing when or if she would see him again - she would not take the step of giving up her son. Surely this had been a Faustian dilemma for Dofia Paulita, and she showed re- markable strength and conviction in her decision. It is the kind of life lesson that would have left an indelible impression on her children, at least upon those of them who were old enough to notice. Perhaps it is her example that reinforces the closeness of her children and their families today. Anyone who has visited Juan Quezada's home is ac- quainted with the family atmosphere that prevails. From grandparents to the smallest child (now grandchild), family members belonging to several genera- tions come and go freely and often. The homes of various kin in the village are not linked by telephone, but they remain in contact on a daily basis. Juan rarely if ever travels to a show or workshop without his wife, Guillermina, and</page><page sequence="11">Through a Mother's Eyes 141 they are often accompanied by one or more of their children or other relatives. Demonstrations and exhibits are very demanding on Juan and he is not willing to endure these pressures without having members of his family, especially his wife, close by. C: How many children did you have? P: Ten. But one died in childhood. He drowned there, in the river. Yes ... [thoughtful pause] .., .we lived through a lot, and now I believe and I say, well, [Juan] doesn't have this or that, but at least he eats. Right? With his mind, with his work.., .he is capable. I hope that one day one of his children will turn out like him.., .that they will follow the work of their father and his mind. What about this one [indicating one of her grandsons sitting nearby]? Why don't I see anything in him? I don't see any of them aspiring to anything. Because Juan already, I tell you, he was even younger than this boy when the energy that he had, his thoughtful mind, became apparent. In this statement revealing the inescapable nature of the generation gap, Dofia Paulita voices a lack of faith in the very youngest members of her fam- ily. (Her doubts turn out to be spoken prematurely since Juan's children, as they have grown up, are taking up their father's profession: Nena, Noe, Mireya, and Arturo are already becoming established, talented potters. Others will surely follow their lead.) But Dofia Paulita's words were meant as a tes- timony to her son's talent. In her perception, Juan's artistic genius emerged early and strong, and his eventual career seemed somehow fated to take place. In actuality, the likelihood of Juan achieving wide notoriety as an artist was as remote as the small, isolated village he calls home. Were it not for the confluence of several factors, it might not have come about at all. First and most significant was Juan's extraordinary talent for discovering the techniques necessary to make pottery, and the level of refinement to which he was able to elevate his work. The second factor was the influence of a team of ar- chaeologists from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History and the Amerind Foundation in Arizona that spent several seasons excavating the nearby Paquime ruins in the late 1950s. The increased demand for Casas- Grandes-style pottery in the wake of their activity demonstrated the value of potterymaking as a commercial enterprise. The third factor was the serendipit- ous meeting, some years later, with Spencer MacCallum, the American an- thropologist/entrepreneur who joined forces with Juan to take this art form to a wider audience. C: Tell us about the people that come looking for the ollas that are produced here in Mata Ortiz. Do people come often? P: Yes. Americans come. C: Americans come looking for ollas? Is the fame spreading now about the art pro- duced here in Mata Ortiz? P: Yes, sir, they come often.</page><page sequence="12">142 PRICE C: So now many people that never heard of Mata Ortiz come here for.., .because of the fame of... P: Because of Juan's reputation and the work that he does. Many people come to... often to see his work. C: So he has brought another means of support to the people here, the art that he has made, and also he has taught the other members of the family. P: Yes, of course. He was the promoter of these things. He invented this from his own head to help them and support them, and to help himself, and so on. He... nobody taught him .., .he taught himself. C: Yes. P: That's right. Many people admire him because he came to that... to the work that he does, how can I say it, by himself, because he never had a lesson. I say this be- cause he is very shy. Yes, he's a very shy person. He used to hide and didn't want to meet people, and that's how he's been since he was young. If it was left to him he wouldn't see anyone, or talk with anyone. It's just that his art requires him to do so because.., .because of what he knows. But he is happier by himself. And he is still that way, don't doubt it. Imagine! Often he won't go outside just so he won't run into anyone. "Go on, visit with them, don't be like that, Juan." "But that's how I am," he says. "How can I be another way?" Yes. He just doesn't like to visit with people much. He has been a real loner in everything. People who spend time with Juan are struck by his graciousness. Always polite, he is an authentic ambassador for this region of north-central Mexico, which is widely known for its friendliness and hospitality. Groups of strangers making the trek to Mata Ortiz to meet Juan and buy pottery are often wel- comed into his house, which on such occasions serves as a combination recep- tion hall, showroom, and workshop. During the trips that Juan and his family make to exhibits and demonstrations from time to time, he untiringly answers the audience's questions, and often spends hours as the focus of attention. What makes this notable is a fact that may surprise some who have met him - that Juan is shy by nature and left to his own devices would probably not venture into the limelight at all. Just as in his youth he spent hours alone painting in his room or gathering firewood in the hills, today he is most content alone or with family and close friends, either at home or out in the countryside. Yet he knows that in order for his art to progress he must meet the public. De- spite his preference for not being the center of attention he has learned to han- dle this new dimension of his life in a graceful manner. One day recently I was reminiscing with Juan about the events of the last dozen years and how his life had taken various turns. It came up that in the early years of his ascendency as an artist he had suffered from insomnia, which he felt resulted from the unfamiliar demands of public life. He was spending more time away from home, holding shows, giving demonstrations, meeting new people, and still managing to attend to his production schedule,</page><page sequence="13">Through a Mother's Eyes 143 to his livestock, and to his other responsibilities as the head of a large house- hold. Finally, he said, after trying various home remedies and commercial products without satisfaction, in a chance conversation with a visitor he learned about a preparation made with cilantro (coriander). He tried it, it worked, and he says he has not missed a night's sleep since. The significance of this for Juan is that he, like most of us, prefers not to live his life under stressful conditions. He is very much a product of his own rural circumstances, and he is insufficiently lured by the comforts and attrac- tions of city living to trade his lifestyle. Having selected a few conveniences that his art has enabled him to afford - such as a pickup truck, a refrigerator, a television and a gas stove - Juan is content to remain in Mata Ortiz. Despite the village's economic limitations, in many ways it is an appeal- ing life where nature's cycles are felt more prominently than the man-made ones that urban dwellers tend to live by. There is a compelling familiarity in the changing of the seasons, the planting and harvesting of crops, the river's rise and fall, the rainfall and vegetation patterns, and the births, marriages, and deaths of neighbors. Juan and his family are committed to these cycles, and they live their lives according to them. Constructs such as market value, supply and demand, inflations and recessions, even calendars and clocks are arbitrary and less immediate. While the members of the Quezada family are willing participants in the international art market, with its schedules, contracts and commercialism, they are not of it, being insulated instead by layers of culture and miles of dirt road. On occasion, Juan has been known to come up short on an order of pot- tery or to miss a deadline with a trader. The reason may be a sick cow, a wed- ding in the family, or a visit to his father's farm in the hills. Such events as these are consistent with his priorities: his life is integrated into the rhythms and obligations of the local village far more than those of the external world. C: Where is your husband now? P: He's over at his rancho, there in the mountains. C: What does he raise there? P: Corn, beans. C: So you'll have fresh corn then in, when: June? July? P: November. In October, November. C: And you make nixtamal [dough for tortillas]? P: Yes. At times he does well, and at times he doesn't. C: Does he grow zucchini? P: Yes, also. Yes, of course. C: Tell us... you have other children, right? Tell us the names of your children who are involved in this work of making ollas as potters.</page><page sequence="14">144 PRICE P: Well, Consolaci6n, Reynalda, Reynaldo, Nicoldis, Oscar, Lydia. Who else? That's all, right? He [Juan] has taught all of them.., he taught them. So that they, too, could work to earn their own money. Because he has not been at all selfish with this work that he created from his head. C: And so they are their own bosses; they don't have to work for anyone. P: Not for anyone. That's right, sir. They are able to make a living for themselves. C: So you must be very proud of your family. P: Yes, I, well, I feel very happy, very content, thanks to God, because it has turned out this way... C: Yes. P: ... that... well, as I say, we don't have this or that, either him or us, but at least we eat. C: And you live life very much at peace here in the village, right? P: Yes, yes. C: All the family united. P: United by their work, each one working for himself or herself, as they are able. They don't make a lot of money, no. But as I say ... C: More pleasant than working for a boss, right? P: Yes. They help and they help us [referring to her husband and herself] because they all contribute to us, we can't deny it. Everyone helps us as they are able. Taking stock of her situation, Dofia Paulita is proud of her son, grateful that her family is together, and content with the life that she and her husband are able to lead with the support of her children. And despite the doubt she im- pulsively expressed earlier about their lack of artistic motivation, she is also proud of her other children, her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. C: So, how many grandchildren and great-grandchildren do you have? P: Well, I have some 16 great-grandchildren. And grandchildren, I have 47. I have a lot of grandchildren. C: It's very beautiful to have a big family. On the days like Mother's Day and Christ- mas and others everyone always comes to see you. P: Yes. My house fills up with people. You can't believe how many people there are. [I'm] very content, very pleased, very happy, with all my children here around me. C: One feels blessed by God. P: Yes, of course. It's a shame that I'm now so old. Now one of these days I will leave them. I tell my daughter, "The day has to come." Right? C: Well, you can be satisfied that you raised them well. P: And they never left me, because you know that there are children that leave and abandon their parents and forget about them, right? And these children, without a doubt, my kids, none of them, thank God... they have all stayed by my side. Right</page><page sequence="15">Through a Mother's Eyes 145 Figure 2.

He wanted to go spend a little while there and, well, he asked permission and everything. We agreed and let him go and make his way. We'll see what luck he has there. I hope to God that it will be good. It's just that, believe me, they get tired of that work [as potters] and get bored and they feel the desire to work at something else. Juan's mother put her finger on a common sentiment among potters and other artists who feel the need for a change of focus periodically. Whether or not their talents and energies result in the most superlative creations, many creative people need another outlet in order to be able to endure in a successful career. Juan finds his solace in the most familiar of things - a picnic in the mountains, an afternoon spent fishing, relaxing in the company of friends, or looking after his livestock. These, as much as his art, are the activities that</page><page sequence="16">146 PRICE Figure 3. Anthropomorphic figurine (bone). Photo by William F. Price. Figure 4.

They are activities that define his time and place, and that tell us as much about who he is as his pottery does. As our conversation with Dofia Paulita drew to a close, we were invited to view some of the artwork that Juan had done in his childhood. She showed these items to us one by one, pausing to retrieve them from the different parts of the house where they were stored or displayed. The painted airplanes and the cats with big necks made out of bone that she mentioned earlier had disap- peared long ago, but she had managed to save a number of items from earlier points in his career: a carved wooden bird-of-prey (Figure 1), a graceful wad- ing bird fashioned of cow horn (Figure 2), a bone figurine (Figure 3); and sev- eral framed paintings, including a bridge across Copper Canyon (Figure 4), a bird feeding its young (Figure 5), and a surreal pastoral scene. As we enjoyed her proud display of these mementos I was struck by Dofia Paulita's strength, this small woman with the big heart who had raised ten chil- dren in a village at the far end of a dirt road, where most people cooked over wood-fired stoves, managed without indoor plumbing, and considered a third- grade education a major accomplishment. Together with her husband, Don Jose, she was able to provide a home and keep her family together, frequently Figure 5. Dofia Paulita with painting of bird feeding young (oil). Photo by William F.

She has been both creator of, and witness to, the life of her son, Juan, whose ingenuity and talent have enabled him to emerge as an artist and teacher on an international scale. Set against the limitations of their humble begin- nings, both of these individuals are remarkable people. Through their own ef- forts they have each shaped their dreams into reality, like so much clay, over- coming significant obstacles along the way. Note: Dofia Paulita Celado de Quezada met a tragic and untimely death in an auto accident in the sum- mer of 1992, as the present manuscript was in preparation. It is with great sadness and respect that this article is dedicated to her memory.
