<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Genealogy of Worlds according to Nietzsche Claudia Crawford If one is a philosopher as men hâve always been philosophers, one cannot see what has been and becomes - one sees only what is. But since nothing is, all that was left to the philosopher as his "world" was thè imaginary. (WP 570) Let us proceed with Nietzsche. Something we can only attempt and always repeat attempting. This essay will be in itself an originary act, a creating, after Nietzsche, an appropriation of an action of création already made, yet still becoming created. We will create, after Nietzsche's prompting, a genealogy of worlds. The first and most radical movement in this genealogy consists of the récognition of a bold and decisive division between worlds. On one side of this division we hâve the actual world (wirklichen Welt) (world A), the world of becoming. On the other side we hâve the world of being, the 'real' world (wahre Welt) (world Cl). Bridg- ing the chasm between the actual world (A) and the 'real' world (Cl) is the 'apparent' world (scheinbare Welt) (world Bl). The 'apparent' world (Bl) is world A, the world of becoming, adapted and interpreted through bodily perception and translated into the concepts of world Cl, the world of being. World Bl provides us with as much as we are capable of 'knowing' of world A. Any other world must be posited upon or against this 'apparent' world. "Inso- far as the sensés show becoming, passing away and change, they do not lie. But Heraclitus will remain eternally right with his assertion that being is an empty fiction. The 'apparent' world is the only one . . ." (TI p. 480). Before we proceed to a closer look at thèse three and other worlds in Nietzsche's genealogy of worlds, let us first look at the process by which this création of multiple worlds becomes possible. There is a process that connects (through bodily perception) the two worlds of A and Cl and makes possible this very division (that is, the 'concept' of a division), this création of a "separate world beside the other world." This process is already, in many quarters, well known, and yet, in our proceeding with Nietzsche, we will Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 27, No. 3, 1994. Copyright © 1994 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park PA 202</page><page sequence="2">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 203 look at it another time. This world creating process of which we speak is metaphorization, the originary movement of language. This création proceeds not from God, but by virtue of human language. Nietzsche states, "I suspect that we hâve still not yet gotten rid of God, since we still hâve faith in Grammar." The actual world (A) présents a sensé stimulus to thè body, itself part of world A, which interprets it into an image - first metaphor. The body translates this image into a sound - second metaphor (See TL 82-83). 1 "Finally, concepts, the collecting together of many images in something nonvisible but audible (word)" (WP 506) - third metaphor. Each step of this process of metaphorization repre- sents a leap completely out of one sphère into the midst of an entirely différent one and brings us finally, precisely by this jump- by-jump process, to language, to the formation of ideas where "every idea originates through equating the unequal" (TL 179). Our body and its processes belong to the actual world (A), our individuai perception créâtes the 'apparent' world (Bl), and com- munal conceptualization créâtes the 'real' world (Cl). The process of metaphorization allows us to 'detach' ourselves from world A, through this déception of consciousness, and cross thè divide to world Cl, from whose vantage point we can, in effect, look back at world A, and thus at ourselves, as if from a distance. With this prying loose of ideas from their originary sense-stimulus and the body, through the forgetting of the process itself, a 'separate' world has been created (world Cl). The significance of language for the évolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world [world A as it is known through world Bl] off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long âges believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates ... he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world. (H 11) World Cl, then, the world of language that has become our 'real' world, seeks to be a world of mastery, "a place ... so firmly set that . . . it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it." Of what does this mastery consist? It consists of the error of the "thought that in language man really possesses knowledge of the world." Why, we ask, in proceeding with Nietzsche, does humankind need or want mastery over and 'knowledge' of the world (world A as it is perceived through world</page><page sequence="3">204 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD Bl)? Because thè actuality of world A 'appears' to have no lasting place for humankind: Once upon a time, in some out of thè way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar Systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but never- theless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congé aled, and the clever beasts had to die. - One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened. For this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life. (TL 79) The answer to our question, Why? is, then, that humans fear extinction in the actuality of world A, in the récognition that they are mastered by it. World A, the actual world, as Nietzsche posits it is a place in which "everything is bound to and conditioned by everything eise." It is a world of becoming, déception, contradic- tion, change - and thus suff ering. World A is the world of the will to power that ultimately directs and makes possible both thè body and the nerve stimulus that acts upon it as well as its spécifie reaction and will destroy the worlds of Bl and Cl in destroying thè body. The will to power is "the organic process by virtue of which dominant, shaping, commanding forces continually extend the bounds of their power and continually simplify within these bounds . . ." (WP 342). As Nietzsche's "fable," quoted above, suggests, the thought that humans have thè power to dominate anything in world A is ludicrous in the deepest degree. And yet this is the projeet that humans undertake with language and con- sciousness and this is the foundation of world Cl, their 'real' world. For Nietzsche consciousness is only a surface, something about thè body and not its strongest attribute. World Bl is world A necessarily adapted through perception, that is, interpreted: The apparent world, i.e., a world viewed aecording to values, or- dered, selected aecording to values; i.e., in this case aecording to the viewpoint of utility in regard to the préservation and enhancement of thè power of a certain species of animal. . . . Every center of force adopts a perspective toward the entire remainder, i.e. , its own particu- lar valuation, mode of action, and mode of résistance. The "apparent</page><page sequence="4">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 205 world", therefore, is reduced to a spécifie mode of action on the world, emanating from a center. Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the "world" is only a world for the totality of thèse actions. Reality consists precisely in this particular action and reac- tion of every individuai part toward the whole - . . . . The spécifie mode of reacting is the only mode of reacting; we do not know how many and what kinds of other modes there are. But there is no "other", no "true", no essential being - for this would be the expres- sion of a world without action and reaction. (WP 305) So, hère, Nietzsche points to the inévitable falsification upon which the création of world Cl through interprétation rests: it is our 'real' world; but it is based only upon 'appearance' (the 'apparent' world Bl). Nietzsche détails the process by which multiple and particular instances of appearance lead to the 'real' world (Cl) and why it is 'true' for us. "Appearance" itself belongs to reality: it is a form of its being; i.e. , in a world where there is no being, a certain calculable world of identical cases must first be created through appearance: a tempo at which observation and comparison are possible, etc. Appearance is an arranged and simplified world, at which our prac- tical instincts hâve been at work; it is perfectly true for us; that is to say, we live, we are able to live in it: proof of its truth for us - The world, apart from our condition of living in it, the world that we hâve not reduced to our being, our logic and psychological préju- dices, does not exist as a world "in-itself"; it is essentially a world of relationships; under certain conditions it has a diff ering aspect from every point; its being is essentially différent from every point; it presses upon every point, every point resists it - and the sum of thèse is in every case quite incongruent. Our particular case is interesting enough: we hâve produced a con- ception in order to be able to live in a world, in order to perceive just enough to endure it. (WP 306) Our psychological perspective is determined by the following: 1. that communication is necessary, and that for there to be communi- cation something has to be firm, simplified, capable of précision (above ail in the [so-called] identical case). For it to be communica- ble, however, it must be experienced as adapted, as "recognizable." The material of the sensés adapted by the understanding, reduced to rough outlines, made similar, subsumed under related matters. Thus the fuzziness and chaos of sensé impressions are, as it were, logieized; 2. The world of "phenomena" is the adapted world which we feel to be real. The "reality" lies in the continuai récurrence of identical, familiär, related things in their logieized character, in the belief that hère we are able to reckon and calcitiate;</page><page sequence="5">206 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD 3. thè antithesis of this phénoménal world is not "thè true world", but the formless unformulable world of the chaos of sensations - another kind of phénoménal world, a kind "unknowable" for us. (WP 307) Thus, Nietzsche tells us that we cannot 'know' the actual world of A, that the 'apparent' world (Bl), the world of 'appearance', al- lows us to posit a world that we can 'know' and live in; this be- comes our 'real' world (Cl). "The 'real world', however one has hitherto conceived it - has always been the apparent world once again" (WP 566). To repeat, through this interprétation of adapta- tion allowed by language, humans hâve created the world of Cl in their desire for mastery. However, this mastery that humans hâve in language, they do not have. Humans now hâve three worlds and mastery over none: humans cannot know world A; they have largely forgotten or overlooked the adaptive process of meta- phorization and thus do not know world Bl; and they have added the world of Cl, but only as a lie - a fiction or fable that does not know itself as such. Proceeding yet farther with Nietzsche, let us break into an inter- section with the texts of Parmenides, Heidegger, and Nietzsche. Let us restate our assertion that with the création of world Cl humans have written, if you will, the novel of a fabulated world. Ail thinking including philosophy is fictionary literature of the first rank. The Greeks, as Lacoue-Labarthe brings to our attention by quoting Heidegger, knew this: Mythos and logos are not, as our current historians of philosophy claim, placed into opposition by philosophy as such; on the contrary, the early Greek thinkers (Parmenides, fragment 8) are precisely the ones to use mythos and logos in the same sensé.2 Heidegger also writes: Mythos is what has its essence in its telling - what is apparent in the unconcealedness of its appeal. The mythos is that appeal of foremost and radical concern to all human beings which makes man think of what appears, what is in being.3 This sensé in which Heidegger means mythos, as being, is not, as Lacoue-Labarthe strategically points out, the way in which Nietz- sche means fable as we have already seen. What 'appears' (world A through Bl) is not being, but is still and continually becoming. Being is the 'lying' thought of logos (world Cl) that is added to what 'appears'. Both Heidegger and Nietzsche suggest that the</page><page sequence="6">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 207 sundering apart of mythos and logos was already présent in Piato. Heidegger states: Historians and philologists, by virtue of a préjudice which modem rationalism adopted from Platonism, imagine that mythos was de- stroyed by logos. But nothing religious is ever destroyed by logic; it is destroyed only by the God's withdrawal.4 Even though Heidegger unités mythos and logos , he takes them for 'real', that is, having being in the sensé of world Cl. Opposed to this, Lacoue-Labarthe emphasizes Nietzsche's position in opposi- tion to Heidegger's: The identity that Nietzsche suspects does not in fact hide a pro- foundly dialectical identification in which logos is the truth of mythos (as true saying), but in which mythos authenticates the ontological originarity of logos , its purity prior to their séparation and opposition. Mythos and logos are the same thing, but neither is more true (or more false, deceptive, fictional, etc.) than thè other; they are neither true nor false; both are the same fable.5 Thus, quite antithetical to Heidegger's meaning of thè ultimate indistinguishability between mythos and logos as being, for Nietz- sche, logos (reason, philosophy) continually becomes fable (fic- tion, mythos) from thè start, in the ever recurring moment in which the world becomes metaphor. One could say that language (Cl) is one puise of becoming (A) and beats with it not in any sensé over against it or in a dominant relationship to it. There is nothing behind it to guarantee the 'truth' of its existence. Our création of world Cl has resulted not in our mastery, but rather in its having created us as one of its myriads of fables and fictions: the 'philoso- pher' becomes only one of many necessary functions/fictions of the text of this world. The 'real' world (Cl), then, is a world of neces- sary déception, of fairy taie, of illusion. This conira-diction, which is language used to preserve humans in thè face of the actual world (world A), is a fictional world that signifies in 'reality' not being as Heidegger suggests, but is only a fictionally represented world that we create and that créâtes us. Parmenides said: "Man does not think what is not."6 Hei- degger writes that thè usuai translation is "For it is the same thing to think and to be."7 However, Heidegger translates this phrase from the Greek somewhat differently: "For the same: taking-to-heart is so also présence of what is présent."8 In thèse three Statements we hâve what Heidegger calls "thè basic thème</page><page sequence="7">208 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD of ail of Western-European thinking. This history of what think- ing is is at bottom a séquence of variations on this one thème, even where Parmenides' saying is not specifically cited."9 He continues, "The essential nature of thinking is determined by what there is to be thought about: the présence of what is prés- ent, the Being of beings."10 With this Heidegger only intensifies a dominant metaphysical thème: "I think therefore I am" in Descartes; "Being is thinking" in Hegel. Again, for Nietzsche thinking is not being and cannot posit being other than in an ersatz way, for language and thinking are only fleeting fictional adaptations of the becoming of the will to power (world A); we and ail our fictions are this will to power. "And do you know what 'the world' is to me? . . . This world is the will to power - and nothing besides. And you yourselves are also this will to power - and nothing besides!" (WP 1067). World A knows nothing of présence, of being, it knows nothing of what is now - with language - possible in world Cl, namely, the subject, the human as the constituting subject, the subject of phi- losophy: "The philosopher [who] imagines he sees from ail sides thè eyes of thè universe telescopically directed upon his actions and thoughts" (TL 174). This is what Parmenides' Statement re- flects and what Heidegger's rewriting of it confirms: the belief that humans with language and thought know what is and that what is is présent and is being, fixed and controlled. Next, in proceeding with Nietzsche in this genealogy of worlds, another incredible movement takes place precisely because hu- mans forget the processes of world Bl that create world Cl. Taking the 'real' world (Cl) as the only world and seeing in it, despite présence and being, change, suffering, transitoriness, that is, be- coming, humans in the process of this struggle with chaos began to cali the 'real' world (Cl) the 'apparent' world (B2) and devised the conception of a 'true' (wahre Welt) or 'other' world (andere Welt) or 'moral' world (moralische Welt) (worlds C2) over against it, a further attempt at mastery, at creating pure being. The naivete was to take an anthropocentric idiosyncrasy as the mea~ sure of things, as the rule for determining "real" and "unreal": in short, to make absolute something condì tioned. And behold, sud- denly the world feil apart into a "true" world and an "apparent" world: and precisely the world man's reason had devised for him to live and settle in was discredited . . . the intention was to deceive oneself in a useful way: the means, the invention of formulas and</page><page sequence="8">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 209 signs by means of which one could reduce the confusing multiplicity to a purposive and manageable scheme. . . . The law of contradiction provided thè schema: the true world, to which one seeks the way, cannot contradict itself, cannot change, cannot become, has no begin- ning and no end. . . . This is thè greatest error that has e ver been committed, the essential fatality of error on earth: one believed one possessed a criterion of reality in the forms of reason - while in fact one possessed them in order to become master of reality, in order to misunderstand reality in a shrewd manner - And behold: now thè world became false, and precisely on account of the properties that constitute its reality: change, becoming, multiplic- ity, opposition, contradition, war. And then the entire fatality was there: 1.) How can one get free from thè false, merely apparent world? ( - it was the real, the only one); 2.) How can one become oneself as much as possible the antithesis of the character of the apparent world? (Concept of thè perfect crea- ture as an antithesis to the real creature, more clearly as the contradic- tion of life- ) (WP 315-16) With world Cl humans created a relatively stable world in rela- tionship to world A, but it was not y et stable enough, and thus the worlds of C2 were created. In world Cl, the philosophical subject has contempt for ail that perishes, changes, varies, and desires a world of the constant. The sensés deceive, reason corrects the errors; consequently, one concluded, reason is the road to the constant; the least sensual ideas must be closest to the 'true' world. It is from the sensés that most misfortunes corne - they are deceivers, deluders, destroyers . . . hap- piness can be guaranteed only by being. (WP 317) Thus, to the 'apparent' world (Bl) and to the 'real' world (Cl) yet other worlds are added by 'lies' and are called the 'true' or 'other' or 'moral' worlds (all C2 worlds). Hère 'true' knowledge is at- tained whether philosophically or religiously. But while humans believed they had finally arrived at perception of 'truth', they had actually gone even a further step away from what actually exists as world A. To state it differently, if world Cl (as the 'real' world) is not after all true, then two choices présent themselves: either hu- mans must logically abolish or change themselves (world Cl), their 'reality', or they must intensify thè world's fictionality, must create super-fictions that are "more enticing, more incompréhensible," that involve thè remove of a remove (from world A as interpreted through Bl creating Cl, which itself becomes a world of 'appear-</page><page sequence="9">210 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD ance' [B2] and finds 'truth' only in the worlds of C2), what Nietz- sche calls a "phantasmagoria of 'another', a 'better life' " (TI 484). These C2 worlds are the 'true' worlds over and against the world of Cl, the 'real' world, which has now become 'false' and whose former 'truth' was true as a resuit of the 'falsity' of the 'apparent' world (Bl), which is itself only an interprétation of the actual world (A). (See diagram l.) A ►Bl - ►Cl-j **C1 = B2 **C2 actual apparent real j (but then) real = apparent true/other/moral Diagram 1. These 'other', 'true', and 'moral' worlds (C2s) hâve been the primary concern of philosophy and metaphysics as well as of reli- gion and morality over the centuries since Piato, and thus, for Nietzsche, the historiés of philosophy, religion, and morality hâve been a super-fabulization of the world that has led humans far afield of their actual existence. . . . another world, where things are différent; something in us calcu- lâtes, our still submission, our silence, lose their value - perhaps everything will turn out well, we have not hoped in vain - the world where things are différent, where we ourselves - who knows? - are différent- (WP 320) The places of origin of the notion of "another world": The philosopher, who invents a world of reason, where reason and thè logicai functions are adequate: this is the origin of the "true" world; the religious man, who in vents a "divine world": this is the origin of the "denaturalized, anti-natural" world; the moral man, who invents a "free world": this is the origin of the "good, perfect, just, holy" world . . . What the three places of origin have in common: the psychological blunder, the physiological confusions. By what attributes is the "other world," as it actually appears in history, distinguished? By the Stigmata of philosophical, religious, moral préjudice. The "other world," as illuminateci by thèse facts, as a synonym for nonbeing, nonliving, not wanting to live - General insight: it is the instinct of life-weariness, and not that of life, which has created the "other world." Conséquence: Philosophy, religion and morality are Symptoms of décadence. (WP 322)</page><page sequence="10">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 211 What centering in thèse C2 worlds allows is that they become a vantage point from which to turn back upon 'reality' (Cl) and castigate it. The psychology of ressentiment "had to invent another world from whose point of view affirmation of life appeared as evil, as the reprehensible as such" (AC 593). This world of pure fiction [the C2 Christian world of sin, conscience, God] is vastly inferior to the world of dreams insofar as the latter mirrors reality, whereas the former falsifies, dévalues, and negates reality. Once the concept of "nature" had to become a synonym of "reprehensible": this whole world of fiction is rooted in hatred of the naturai (of reality!): it is the expression of a profound vexation at the sight of reality. ( AC 582) The more fabulous world C2's création, the more philosophers hâve maintained the réputation of logos and the irrepute of mythos. Hère at the point at which philosophy becomes most com- pletely literature is the point at which it begins to define itself as that which may be defined by the very fact of its différence from literature. Or, the Other' worlds of religion are maintained upon the thought of mythos and oppose logos. But logos and mythos are, again, the same fabulation, the same human activity of préserva- tion. If there be 'reality' in world Cl it is in the fiction of the text itself, which has now even created its fiction's fiction (C2). The super-fictions of the worlds of C2 are many and Nietzsche détails the historical error of thèse fictions in his "History of an Error." Piato began it with the world of Ideal forms: 1. The true world, (is) attainable to the wise, the pious, the virtuous man - he dwells in it, he is it. (Oldest form of thè idea, relatively sensible, simple, convincing. Transcription of the proposition "I, Piato, am the Truth.") Soon, however, with the religious perspective and especially with Christianity, which institutionalized it, ideas of thè eternai "af- terworld" or "other" worlds of heaven and hell dominate: 2. The true world (becomes) unattainable for the moment, but prom- ised to the wise, the pious, the virtuous man ('to the sinner who repents'). (Progress of thè idea: it grows more refined, more entic- ing, more incompréhensible - it becomes woman, it becomes Chris- tian. . . .) With metaphysics Kant invents the transcendental world: "In order that a place remain for 'moral freedom' " (WP 310). Of the Kantian "true world," Nietzsche writes: "The conception of a 'true world/</page><page sequence="11">212 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD thè conception of morality as the essence of the world (thèse two most malignant errors of ail time!), were once again ... if not provable, at least no longer refutable. Reason, the right of reason, does not extend that far. Reality had been reduced to mere 'appear- ance,' and a mendaciously fabricated world, the world of being, was honored as reality" (AC 577). Thus, Kant refines the other world of Christian belief and translates it into the thing-in-itself , inaccessible to knowledge but morally binding nevertheless. 3. The true world, unattainable, undemonstrable, cannot be promised, but even when merely thought of a consolation, a duty, an imperative. (Fundamentally the same old sun, but shining through mist and scepticism; thè idea grown sublime, pale, northerly, Königsbergian.) Once Kant had made his move others became possible. Hegel re- ifies the 'true' in the Absolute coming to know itself . Schopenhauer appropriâtes the 'true' world of Nirvana from India and teaches "the turning of the Will upon itself," the négation of the 'real' world (Cl). But let us take an even more interesting case. Heidegger's thought coming after Nietzsche (after a close study of Nietzsche) daims to be at the end of metaphysics while suggesting that Nietz- sche still remains a metaphysician. Heidegger does (seemingly) re- main in the 'real' world of Cl with his inquiry into the 'Being of beings'. However, from the perspective of Nietzsche's genealogy of worlds, he is stili a metaphysician, for the 'real world', as we hâve seen, is itself a fable. And Heidegger does fall prey to the super- fiction of a 'true' world (C2) the world of Being as permanancy. Heidegger's word Ständigkeit (permanancy) and his word physis (nature or growth) work to define his project of understanding how permanancy cornes into being {entstehen). It is this permanancy of Being that the poet searches for says Heidegger. Heidegger's analy- sis of human being as Being-in-the-world (Cl) has shape and direc- tion; beside it, the search for Being itself is a piece of literature, a fabulated desire, but no 'truth'. Thus Heidegger still courts a 'true' world. For Nietzsche fictions are what we hâve and what we only always will have. The 'real' world (Cl), in doubting itself and thus, in creating the fabulous worlds of C2 in compensation has not accomplished mastery, but according to Nietzsche has actually weakened itself, has admitted a fault in its own création. The demise of the worlds of C2 are now, following Nietzsche, imminent. Nietzsche's de- scription of thè ultimate demise of all C2 worlds originating over</page><page sequence="12">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 213 against the désignation of thè 'false appearance' (B2) of world Cl, against its 'apparent' qualities in favor of 'stable true' quali- ties is well known: 4. The true world - unattainable? Unattained, at any rate. And if unattained also unknown. Consequently also no consolation, no ré- demption, no duty: how could we hâve a duty towards something unknown? (The grey of dawn. First yawnings of reason. Cock-crow of positivism.) 5. The 'true world' - an idea no longer of any use, not even a duty any longer - an idea grown useless, superfluous, consequently a refuted idea: Let us abolish it! (Broad daylight; breakfast; re turn of cheerful- ness and bon sens; Piato blushes for shame; ail free spirits run riot.) 6. We hâve abolished the true world: what world is left? the apparent world perhaps? . . . But no! with the true world we hâve also abol- ished the apparent world! (Mid-day; moment of the shortest shadow; end of the longest error; zénith of mankind; INCIPIT ZARA- THUSTRA.) (TI 485-86) That is, with the abolition of the 'true' world (C2), which means the abolition of ail 'other' worlds, 'afterworlds', 'moral' worlds, and the 'apparent' world (B2), which was the slandering of the 'real' world (Cl), one is back to dealing only with the 'real' (Cl) world and the original 'apparent' world (Bl) with its multiplicity of interprétations of world A. It is important to note that although the 'real' world of Cl is a perspectival and anthropomorphic world created for human survival and thus a world of fable, it is stili a necessary fiction for Nietzsche because it arises out of appearance. It is appearance, but necessary appearance. When Nietzsche writes Incipit Zarathustra he heralds another possible world, the Dionysian world (D): That the artist esteems appearance higher than reality is no objec- tion to this proposition. For "appearance" hère in this case means reality once more, only by way of sélection, reinforcement, and correction. The tragic artist is no pessimist - he is precisely the one who says Yes to everything questionable, even to the terrible - he is Dionysian. (TI 484) Hère, 'reality' (Cl) as appearance is affirmed - not condemned in favor of 'other' worlds (C2s). The Dionysian artist places more value on appearance (world Bl) than on reality (world Cl) be- cause Cl is a conceptualized version of Bl while Bl is in a doser relationship with world A. Thus, the world Nietzsche suggests is the 'Dionysian' world (D), a world in which becoming, déception,</page><page sequence="13">214 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD contradiction - thus suffering - are not objections to life, but rather stimulants to it. The 'Dionysian' world corrects thè error of the 'other', 'true', or 'moral' worlds and thus thè idea that thè 'real' world (Cl) is merely 'apparent' (B2): "If there is anything that is to be worshipped it is appearance that must be worshipped, that the lie- and not truth- is divine!" (WP 1011). The différ- ence between humans in the 'real' world of Cl (and in the worlds of C2) and in the 'Dionysian' world is expressed in the following formula: To know that something is thus and thus [B2 - C2] To act so that something becomes thus and thus [Bl - Cl] Antagonism in thè degree of power in différent natures. (WP 317) The emphasis is away from seeking to 'know' being, thus négation of Heidegger's project and the major trend of Western philosophy, toward acting in league with the movement of becoming. Thus, the 'Dionysian' world, as Nietzsche's "History of an Error" shows us, is the Overcoming of philosophers through the destruction of the world of being: intermediary period of nihilism: before there is yet présent the strength to reverse values and to deify becoming and the apparent world as the only world, and to cali them good. (WP 319) Let us add to diagram 1 Nietzsche's desire to abolish all C2 worlds in favor of a 'Dionysian' world (see diagram 2).

Notice, that Nietzsche's 'Dionysian' world (D) in valorizing the 'appearance' of the 'apparent' world (Bl) folds back again onto the actual world (A), to a Dionysian affirmation of the world as it is, without subtraction, exception, or sélection - it wants thè eternai circulation: - the same things, the same logic and illogic of entanglements. The highest state a philosopher can attain: to stand in a Dionysian relationship to existence - my formula for this is amorfati.

Amor fati thè opposite of desire for mas- tery, rather acquiescence in nonmastery by willing an alliance with the movements of life and will to power and not with the absurd 'belief' that one can determine or master them - not mastery through 'knowledge', but power in création through becoming. It is no longer the philosopher who writes the protective text of reason (worlds C2); rather, it is the tragic artist who valorizes fiction and affirms the very text of fiction that is the questionable and terrible nature of existence itself. The 'Dionysian' world involves the récog- nition that we are the will to power of the actual world in its becoming and that our proper activity is joining to make becoming happen. It is of cardinal importance that one should abolish the true world. It is the great inspirer of doubt and evaluator in respect of the world we are: it has been our most dangerous attempi yet to assassinate life. . . . The "will to truth" would then hâve to be investigated psychologi- cally: it is not a moral force, but a form of the will to power. This would hâve to be proved by showing that it employs every immoral means: metaphysics above ail - . (WP 314) No! You ought to learn the art of this-worldly comfort first; you ought to learn to laugh, my young friends, if you are hell-bent on remaining pessimists. Then perhaps, as laughers, you may some day dispatch ail metaphysical comforts to thè devii - metaphysics in front. Or, to say it in the language of that Dionysian monster who bears the name of Zarathustra: "Raise up your hearts, my brothers, high, higher! And don't forget your legs! Raise up your legs, too, good dancers; and still better: stand on your heads!" (BT 26) The 'true' worlds (C2) represent decline of power, slander against life, while the 'Dionysian' world (D) represents ascending power and an affirmative fiction for the future of humankind. We return to Heidegger 's statement: "mythos is what has its essence in the telling." If logos and mythos are thè same, he would be in agreement with Nietzsche that language and what humans conceive with it is what it is, a telling, an appearance, a fleeting becoming with nothing behind it. But Heidegger, however tenuous his project, still wants to find Being behind it, still wants his "meta- physical comfort." For Nietzsche, appearance is also always neces- sarily disappearance - Being (permanence) cannot be. Neitzsche writes: "Parmenides said: 'one cannot think of what is</page><page sequence="15">216 CLAUDIA CRAWFORD not'; - we are on thè other extreme and say 'what can be thought must certainly be a fiction* " (WP 291, my emphasis). The création of worlds, which we have seen in proceeding with Nietzsche's gene- alogy of worlds, though by way of logos, has yet remained a cré- ation myth, a piece of literature. The fictions of philosophy, reli- gion, and morality have been a human ritual attempi to seduce thè chaotic powers of world A into control. This "belief in grammar," in language, of which Nietzsche has spoken, is not merely the source of the error of the worlds of C2, but offers the only possibil- ity of correcting this error. Only another fiction can do it. And Nietzsche feels it is essential to correct this error! World D, Nietzsche's 'Dionysian' world, though free of much/ some of the 'falsity' of the other worlds, is, too, of course, a fiction - but a fiction that recognizes itself as such and that affirms itself as such and that laughs at itself as such. That enormous framework and hoarding of ideas, by clinging to which needy man saves himself through life, is to the freed intellect only a scaffolding and a toy for its most daring feats, and when it smashes it to pièces, throws it into convulsions, and then puts it together ironically, pairing the strängest, separating the nearest items, then it manifests that it is now no longer led by ideas but by intuitions. From thèse intuitions no regulär road leads into the land of the spectral Schemata, the abstractions; for them the world is not made, when man sees them he is dumb, or speaks in forbidden meta- phors and in unheard-of combinations of ideas, in order to corre- spond creatively with the impression of the powerful présent intuition at least by destroying and jeering at the old barriers of ideas. (TL 190) Philosophy, religion, and morality are not written by humans; rather, they are written by the very chaos they attempi to seduce. Thus, Nietzsche emphasizes that the 'will to truth' in using the 'immoral' tool of metaphysics to slander life is necessarily itself the becoming of will to power, only one manifestation of the actual world (A). Nietzsche's 'Dionysian' world whether adopted by fu- ture générations or not is also the becoming of that chaos (world A). Lacoue-Labarthe grasps the 'madness', the 'foolishness' - the fiction that ail of this is: Apparently nothing, or almost nothing, has changea. In any case, and despite what a certain Nietzschean violence allows one to think (a violence that is indispensable but doubtless falls far short of this insidious perversion), there is no radical upheaval. If the use of meta- phor is inévitable hère, one could say that, with thought in effect repeating itself, beginning (again), but emptily and without hence-</page><page sequence="16">A GENEALOGY OF WORLDS 217 forth referring back to anything or believing that it can do so, it is as though one were "penetrating" into an unlimited space that is the same as thè space one has (not) just left, but in which thè ground gives way. . . . It is thè elusive limit which one exceeds and which one does not exceed and which separates and does not separate the fool- ishness, the madness.11 Having proceeded with Nietzsche through his genealogy of worlds, let us remember that at best we are only at stage five in his "History of an Error." Although we may be in the process of abolishing the 'true', 'other', and 'moral' worlds (C2) and the 'ap- parent' world (B2), an activity in which we risk a kind of "mad- ness," as Lacoue-Labarthe suggests, we are not yet at the realiza- tion of the 'Dionysian' world (D), where the 'real' world (Cl) becomes 'appearance' (Bl) affirmed. This would be a fiction of yet another order. It would hâve to be a gay science-fiction, in which the world becomes with our playing and laughing no more and no less than that which we as the will to power say it is! But isn't this, as Lacoue-Labarthe points out, what we hâve been doing ail along - only without the playing and laughing?!
