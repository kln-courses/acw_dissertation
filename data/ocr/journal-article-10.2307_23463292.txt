<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES OF THE HEBREW SECTION A Chalcolithic Site at Ramot Nof, Be'er Sheva' P1RHIYA NAHSHONI, YUVAL G0REN, OFER MARDER AND N1GEL G0RING-M0RRIS (Pp. l*-24*) In 1991 a salvage excavation, conducted at Ramot Nof on behalf of the IAA (Permit No. A-1781), revealed Chalcolithic remains in AreaB. The site is situated on the southern bank of Nahal Koveshim, north of Be'er Sheva' (map ref. 13120/07625; Fig. 1). In Stratum B1 a Byzantine structure was unearthed, while Stratum B2, the Chalcolithic occupation level, comprised twelve pits (506, 507, 509-514, 516- 518, 520; diam. 1.0-1.8 m, extant depth 0.25-1.80 m; Fig. 2; Plan 1) and the remains of a living surface from which the pits had been dug, most of which was removed by the Byzantine constmction. The eastern part of the site was damaged by bulldozers. It is impossible to determine whether additional pits are located beyond the excavated area. Broken mudbricks found in the pits indicate the existence of structures that were not preserved. Two near-complete (reconstructed) vessels (Fig. 3:8, 9) were found on the living surface. The pits contained mainly potsherds, flint tools and some stone implements (Figs. 3-11). Pit 511 revealed an outstanding quantity of flint (mainly cores and debitage), and a violin-shaped figurine made of chalk (Fig. 6:3). A single 14C date yielded a (calibrated) date of4540 BCE. The pottery assemblage (Table 1), most of which derives from the pits, includes bowls (200/o, Fig. 3:1-3), kraters (6.60/0, Fig. 3:5-7), goblets (4.40/0, Fig. 3:8), jars (24.40/0, Figs. 4:1-8; 5:1-4; and see also the handles in Fig. 4:13-15 and the bases in Fig. 5:5-9, 12), holemouth jars (42.20/0, Fig. 3:9-14) and votive objects (2.20/0, Fig. 6:1,2). Most of the vessels are handmade and only a few carry thumb-indented decorations or red paint. Most vessels show affinities to pottery shapes of the 'Besor Phase' (Gilead and Alon 1988), which appear in some of the Nahal Besor (Wadi Ghazzeh) sites and at Gilat, but not in the Chalcolithic sites of Be'er Sheva'. Three petrographic groups were identified: the assemblage is dominated by the Taqiye marl + silt with limestone or chalk sand, nari and quartz temper groups (Table 2: Nos. 2, 5, 9-17, 19-26, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 39^47, 50). The second petrographic group is manufactured of Moza marl or clay with crushed calcite temper (Table 2: Nos. 6, 7, 28, 33,48). The third group is made of Taqiye marl + silt and limestone temper groups (Table 2: Nos. 3, 8,31). The flint assemblage (Tables 3,4; Figs. 9-12) consists of debitage (63.40/0), debris (24.00/o), cores (5.50/0) and tools (7.10/0). The frequency of sickle blades at Ramot Nof (22.9*30; Table 4), resembles that at Gerar (240/0) and is close to that of Nahal Besor Sites Dil (120/0; Gilead and Alon 1988: Table 2), A (10o/o) and B (90/0; Roshwalb 1981:28, 97), as opposed to their scarcity in the Be'er Sheva' sites (Rosen 1987). The stone implements include grinding slabs (Fig. 7), a mortar (Fig. 8:1), weights (Fig. 8:6, 7), hammers (Fig. 8:2-5), small standing stones (manevot) made of limestone (Fig. 9) and two anthropomorphic figurines: a violin-shaped</page><page sequence="2">254 Summaries figurine, coarsely carved out of chalk (Fig. 6:3) and a schematic figurine fashioned from a flat pebble (Fig. 6:4). A few small clay objects were found, including homs belonging to zoo morphic figurines (Fig. 6:5-7) and votive vessels resembling an incense burner (Fig. 6:1) and a cornet (Fig. 6:2). The technological and morphological similarities between the pottery assemblage from Ramot Nof and assemblages from the 'Besor Phase5 sites in the Nahal Besor region, along with the 14C date (4540 BCE), indicate an early date in the Chalcolithic sequence (see Gilead 1994: Table 1). The geographical proximity of the site to the Be'er Sheva' Chalcolithic sites suggests that the 'Besor Phase' is a cultural-chronological phase which is characteristic of the entire Northern Negev. It seems that chronologically the 'Besor Phase' follows the 'Qatifian culture', and precedes the 'Ghassul-Be'er Sheva' cultures. Captions to Illustrations Fig. 1.
