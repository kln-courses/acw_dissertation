University of Texas Press, Austin, 1988. 166 pages. The spare, elegant design of this book entices anyone who longs for a reliable, lucid treatment of prehistoric architecture. The author, William Morgan, is an accom- plished architect whose long-standing interest in the subject has not only informed his own designs but inspired him to publish an earlier book, Prehistoric Architecture in the Eastern United States (mit Press, 1980). It was on Guam in the Mariana Islands that Morgan, a naval officer during World War II, first encountered the architectural remains that led to Prehistoric Archi- tecture in Micronesia. Still intrigued, he returned years later to study the fragmen- tary, evocative ruins. In the ancient settlements on these small island groups in the western Pacific he found an affecting immediacy and sense of place, and he saw their builders, unlike Western architects, as being "in touch with the natural systems of their environment" (p.vii). The depth Morgan's feeling for these ancient sites underlies his matter-of-fact account of Western contact with, and subsequent destruction of, many aspects of Micronesian culture. In this book, rather than attempting to provide broad, exhaustive coverage of architectural remains throughout Micronesia, Morgan elects to present a few examples "thoroughly." Employing a geographical system of organization, he first sketches a setting for each site using historical and archaeological sources and then documents selected monuments in depth with drawings, photographs and text. The study focuses on examples of ancient monumental architecture in five major areas: Pohnpei, Kosrae, Yap, Palau and the Marianas. Ranging in size from the 215-square-mile island of Guam to tiny coral reefs, the islands of Micronesia may have been among the last places on earth settled by human beings - possibly as late as 1300 B.c. But after Ferdinand Magellan landed in the Marianas in 1521, Western exploration and dominance progressed through Sir Francis Drake's visit in 1579 and subsequent Spanish, German and Japanese occu- pations. Following World War 11, the islands were held in American "trusteeship." At present, they are organized into several self-governing entities: the Common- wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the republics of Belau and Kiribati, and the Federated States of Micronesia. In the more than 470 years since Magellan's arrival, much evidence of the early architecture of the islands has been lost.</page><page sequence="2">90 • TD SR 3.1 At the time of Magellan's visit, the Chamorros native to the Mariana Islands were still building structures supported on latte - foundations of huge megalithic columns with capstones. Today these weathered latte "silently recall the once splendid architecture of northern Micronesia," Morgan writes (p.n6). Despite its relatively recent origins (com- pared, for example, to the earliest European megalithic ar- chitecture, c. 4800 B.c.), much about the function and even the form of prehistoric Micronesian architecture remains a mystery. For example, extensive terraced earthworks were created from natural hillforms on Palau perhaps in the period 400 - 1600 A.D. And, also on Palau, nine huge carved mega- liths, thought to be anthropomorphic, stand in two rows near the sea. Information on some is missing, while others are still connected with suggestive traditional names and legends; but all seem to have been highly symbolic, even though, as Morgan explains, their precise significance is now unclear. Further mystery is supplied by the fact that architectural configurations such as the megalithic colonnades and the latte represent only fragments of earlier architectural constructions. In particular, the structures associated with the photogenic latte may have been of wood and may now be completely unrecoverable. Morgan's drawings, utilizing archaeological and ethnographic sources, assume these structures once re- sembled certain more recent wood buildings in Micronesia. Similarly, Morgan must make assumptions regarding an- cient villages on Pohnpei and Kosrae, where skeletal remains include platforms, walls, pathways, and other features con- structed of prismatic basalt and coral. One such place is the huge complex of Nan Madol on Pohnpei, much of which has returned to jungle, but which once included 93 artificial is- lets. Here, residential and funerary compounds, waterways, reef pools and breakwaters may have been used as royal dwell- ings, tombs, or areas for religious activities. Morgan includes a "provisional map" of Nan Madol based on a synthesis of various surveys and aerial photographs. He also provides isometric drawings of several monuments and a reconstructed elevation of a nahs&gt; or meeting house. The latter drawing is based on a previous archaeological survey and on "personal observations of contemporary wood structures in Pohnpei," since structures existing at the time of Western contact disintegrated long ago. This gap between past and present - although enviably small from the perspective, say, of a Paleolithic scholar - is the major reason for what Morgan describes as a "lack of reliable information" on almost every aspect of prehistoric Micronesian architecture. Despite this lack, Morgan, accompanied by various guides and experts, undertakes his architectural mission with the boldness and energy of a frontiersman. He brings to the enterprise both the patience, rigor and acuity required to describe the architecture and the technical knowledge and enthusiasm necessary to understand its construction. Sharp, carefully composed photographs, meticulous maps and draw- ings, and Morgan's well-considered architectural compari- sons and proposed reconstructions are the strength of this clean and uncluttered book. The reader is treated to a pure - even austere - vision of Micronesian design from the vantage point of an architectural expert. To achieve this lucid, orderly effect, however, Morgan has not only had to speculate, but to oversimplify; and this leads to several problems. If it is possible, the book's design may be too uncluttered. This shows through in a number of ways. Although the drawings and photographs are exquisite, they are parsimonious. And while the renderings are packed with graphic information, words are rarely permitted to invade their pristine borders. In village plans, one must burrow in the text to connect building types with their diagrammatic representations (e.g., pp.34 - 35, 66 - 67, 94). And plans and sections of buildings are similarly enigmatic, leaving the reader to search for connections with the text. As for the photographs, while they are technically excellent, they could have provided more information. With some notable excep- tions, they also unnecessarily sacrifice breadth and drama for consistency in vantage point, lighting, filtration, and depth of field. Finally, some sense of an enlivening human presence</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS • 91 is also missing. The stylized male figure included (quite helpfully) for scale in the drawings and the passive figures drawn in a charmingly sanitized nineteenth-century tableau by Fyedor Lütke are the only visual representations of Mi- cronesian people in the book. In the text Morgan also tends to stylize ancient Micronesians. He shows them obeying the unspoken rules of traditional ethnography despite recent debate in archaeology over such issues as gender roles (see Ruth Tringham's article in this issue of tdsr). For example, according to Morgan, women typically fished, prepared meals, wove, made pottery, tended gardens, "performed domestic chores and probably assisted in agricultural production," while "men's work" included not only constructing monuments but clearing land, plant- ing, cultivating, harvesting, cooking large quantities of food, building canoes and houses, and manufacturing tools (pp.120, 109 passim). Although it is possible that labor was divided in this manner, to describe women as "tending" or "assisting," and their work as "chores," is outdated. Similarly problematic is Morgan's evocation of a fictional, cumulative moment in history at which each building stood as intended, neither as ruin nor as embryo. Although he does present sequential phases of the city plan of Leluh, his other drawings collapse the centuries and show all buildings as simultaneous and complete. Not that it is easy to convey the diachronic complexities involved; Morgan's attempt to bridge the distance between past and present is heroic, and his failure to do so completely satisfactorily would be inevitable in even the most sophisticated study. But the territory of architectural prehistory, long the province of archaeologists, is a thicket of anthropological and epistemological dilem- mas, and Morgan chooses not to address such frustrating issues as culture and time, structure and history, and society and nature. Instead, he candidly refers those interested in "issues of interpretation" elsewhere, as though interpretation could be avoided in a study of prehistory. In any such study one must select, restore, and invent data, both architectural and historical. An additional difficulty arises in Morgan's insufficient efforts to distinguish fact and speculation for the reader. In Morgan's illustrations the boundaries between documentation and conjecture are invis- ible, causing uncertainty as to where his restorations begin. Morgan also needs to examine his sources for ethnographic information more skeptically and devise a more systematic method of attribution. At times sources are identified, at others they are not. Still, Morgan's frank, workmanlike documentation conveys the beauty and fragility of these Micronesian works of art and provides the first modern study of this Western Pacific archi- tectural tradition. Problematic, neglected, and long barred from the architectural canon, prehistoric monuments are crucial to our understanding of architecture and its relation- ship to memory and place. With the aid of such monuments, and with studies such as this, we may better construct the particular human pasts that shape not only our present, but our uncertain future. ■ JEAN M.
