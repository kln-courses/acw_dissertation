On the one hand, since the Neolithic, hierarchical stratification and political domination have evolved in a relatively short time from the patterns of kinship bonds and ephemeral leadership characteristic of primitive so- ciety (Service, 1975; Carneiro, 1978). On the other hand, the extent of the division of labor and of hierarchical stratification in even the most primitive corporate political groups is significantly greater than that found in egalitarian bands and tribes. This difference lends support to very specific explana- tions such as the theories of cataclysmic sociocul- tural change of political anthropology (Service, 1975:15). Today, archaeologists and ethnologists widely accept that the establishment of multicommunity chiefdoms with hereditary rank order, theocratic rule, and certain primitive patterns of centralized administration preceded the formation of the earliest states (Flannery, 1972). Acceptance of this position has simplified the investigation of the origin of the state considerably. Since the state is a territorial organization with a highly centralized government, a professional ruling class, and repressive law, investi- gation now concentrates on the transformation of chiefly authority and theocratic domination into polit- ical power as an institutionalized sanction (Service, 1975). However, the detailed processes which brought about this transformation still remain a matter of controversy among anthropologists. Present-day theories on the origins of the state can be classified into those that invoke evolutionary, biological cate- gories (e.g., Carneiro, 1978; Alexander, 1979) and those that imply sociocultural relations and processes exclusively. Other hypotheses present state formation in terms of "prime movers" such as irrigation, warfare, or population growth (for a review see Flannery, 1972), in contrast to synthetic, mul- tivariate approaches which exclude monocausal ex- planations (Flannery, 1972; Webster, 1975; Wright, 1977). I suggest that the rise of stratified society fits into a general evolutionary scheme that encompasses the emergence of structurally stable patterns in the prebiotic and the living world. Part of the conceptual framework I have applied in this analysis is bor- rowed from biophysics and evolutionary biology and is reinterpreted with reference to human social interactions. I argue that the evolutionary approach to primary state formation is consistent with the "systemic" position in political anthropology. The position views the origin of the state as the result of a complicated interplay of various social, cultural, and ecological factors. These factors are treated as random variables whose actual specification of and impact on social structures depend on particular historical and spatial conditions. Complex stratified societies may gain historic significance by virtue of their a posteriori: cohesiveness and stability, and not through the operation of social "prime mover mech- anisms," which, in any case, must be assumed to be indeterministic.

The Concepts of Evolutionary and Structural Stability Since von Bertalanffy pointed out about 40 years ago the way that living organisms of all levels of structural complexity maintain the degrees of order they express, the theory of open systems has had a strong impact on modern biology and on the social sciences. Complex open systems are inevitably subject to random fluctuations in the external and internal parameters that define their intrinsic struc- tures and their environmental interactions. These fluctuations raise the question of the stability of open systems. Biocybernetics addresses this ques- tion using such concepts as dynamic equilibrium and homeostasis, and contemporary biophysics pro- vides not only a unified quantitative description of these concepts, but also an adequate understand- ing of them within the compass of the evolution of more highly structured aggregations of matter (Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977; Eigen and Schuster, 1979). If continuous change in one or more of the characteristic parameters of an organic system sub- jects it to a discontinuous transition in ordered behavior, the system is called structurally unstable. Otherwise, it is structurally stable (Thompson and Hunt, 1977; Poston and Stewart, 1978). Structural instabilities do not necessarily destroy an organic system. They may drive it through a sequence of unstable transitional states to a new stable equilib- rium expressing even higher degrees of organiza- tional complexity than the initial one, i.e, "order through fluctuations" (Prigogine, Nicolis, and Babloyantz, 1972). Frequently, natural selection is called the driving force or prime mover of organic evolution. However, this view of evolutionary change is too narrow, since it is restricted to processes of differential reproduc- tion in systems of specified alternative genotypes (neo-Darwinian synthetic theory), and it neglects the random creation of novel genetic structures. The synthetic theory of natural selection is thus con- cerned with the dynamic effects of genetic variation already present in the population but not with the question of where this variation ultimately comes from. Evidently, this question of the ultimate source of variation relates to physicochemical processes of biomolecular replication as opposed to genotypic and organismic reproduction. The presence of non- zero genetic variance in adaptive traits is a neces- sary precondition for selection to be effective, and the ranges of genetic variability in an evolving population are in turn contingent upon the physical properties of mutability of the underlying biochemi- cal structures. Hence, the distinction between the (biomolecular) microlevel and (organismic) macrolevel of biological organization also implies a distinction between the primary and secondary forces of continued evolutionary change (Williams, 1974:138; Eigen and Schuster, 1979:7; Dawkins, 1982:42). The starting point and central issue of my article is that increasing natural self-regulation and organi- zational differentiation in living systems complement the concepts of natural selection and adaptation. Some evolutionary biologists (e.g., Williams, 1974:34) seem to deny the importance of progres- sive functional differentiation, increasing (morpho- logical and physiological) complexity, and related phenomena for the theory of natural selection. How- ever, it would be grossly misleading to ignore the fact that biochemical, organismic, and ecosystem evolution frequently involve increases in organic self-regulation, thus posing highly nontrivial ques- tions to evolutionary theory. In particular, recent analyses of certain fundamental problems in bio- physics and biomolecular chemistry demonstrate that it is necessary to evaluate Darwinian selective advantages among prebiotic autocatalytic agents in terms of their properties of molecular structural stability and their capacities to translate complex information in order to explain the emergence of hierarchies of self-replicating systems and, eventu- ally, the origins of life (Eigen and Schuster, 1979). Dynamic features similar to the patterns of structural instability in self-replicating, biochemical entities have also been shown to govern evolutionary trans- formations in ordered complexity of more inclusive biological systems such as cells, organisms, popula- tions, and ecosystems (Thorn, 1975; Allen, 1976; Dodson, 1976; Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977; Schuster and Sigmund, 1983). Finally, the structural stability approach has been applied to the widely discussed problems of discontinuity and punctuational change in macroevolutionary contexts (Geiger, 1983a), with the result that under quite realistic conditions the probability of a population's fractionating into dis- crete, possibly noninterbreeding morphologies (spe- ciation) may not be an effect of the population's adaptive flexibility but an effect of the degrees of complexity in polymorphic systems and interactions occurring within them. Similar problems arise in analyzing the genetic evolution of social behavior. Today, behavioral ecol- ogy and sociobiology are largely based on concepts of "evolutionarily stable" behavioral strategies of intraspecific competition and cooperation (Maynard Smith and Price, 1973; Krebs and Davies, 1978; Maynard Smith, 1982). When these strategies are fixed genetically in a population, they are not sus- ceptible to replacement by alternative behavior pat-</page><page sequence="3">165 terns. Recent contributions to the dynamics of the evolution of social behavior (Zeeman, 1980, 1981; Thomas and Pohley, 1982; Schuster and Sigmund, 1983) have demonstrated that the conceptual frame- work of evolutionary stable behavior patterns fits into the structural stability approach developed within dynamic systems theory. The proof is based on the fact that gene pools with stationary gene frequencies can be treated as open systems in dynamic equilibrium with their genetic and ecologi- cal environments. However, such equilibria generally vary with biomolecular evolution of the genome and environmental changes in geological time scales, and so will the fitness gains and costs arising from genetically controlled social interactions in natural populations. A behavioral strategy, that is, a set of social traits, is called structurally stable if its differ- ences in selective value persist under fitness per- turbations. Otherwise, a social strategy is called transient (Zeeman, 1980, 1981). Species-specific behavior patterns may thus prove stable or tran- sient, depending on the amplitude of secular envi- ronmental changes and the amplitude of random variations in biomolecular structure. Both modify the fitness differentials attached to behavioral pheno- types. In particular, preadaptive behavioral traits are structurally stable, i.e, they function in environments for which they have not been selected (see Wilson, 1975:Chap. 3). Thus, the stability approach applies to the analysis of nonadaptive traits as well. (The concept of adaptation is used in the strict Darwinian sense here, that is, an organic trait is called adaptive only in relation to the function for which it has been designed by natural selection. See Dawkins, 1982:19.) Accordingly, the specific contribution to the theory of human social structure one may expect from evolutionary theory and sociobiology is to be found in possible explanations of the stability properties of evolved behavior patterns. I will argue that these patterns enter the microfoundations of sociocultural institutions in a characteristic manner. The remarkable diversity of evolutionary phenom- ena governed by certain recurrent modes of struc- tural transformation suggests that universal motor patterns of evolutionary change exist that are not unique to the particular contexts within which they have been observed first. The existence of these patterns offers a formal scheme of increasing natural self-organization that may prove sufficiently abstract to be useful in approaches to sociocultural change. In other words, the formalism, not its biophysical interpretation, should prove applicable to human social organization. Its basic properties may be summarized as follows (Haken, 1978; Weidlich and Haag, 1983:Chap. 1). First, systems in the real world tend to be open in the sense that they exchange matter, energy, and information with their respective environments. Second, they are composed of large numbers of individual subunits among which coop- erative interactions occur (microlevel of organiza- tion), thus giving rise to statistical patterns of collec- tive behavior (spatiotemporally coherent macrostructures). Third, theories concerned with the global behavior of multicomponent systems are by definition restricted to levels of abstraction defined in terms of macroscopic observables and average effects, whereas individual events on the corre- sponding microlevels remain undetermined by the principles governing collective phenomena. The ob- servable state (reference state) of a system (e.g., an equilibrium) is thus susceptible to random perturba- tions arising from irregular behavior on the microlevel of organization (relative to the observer's level of conceptualization). For instance, biomolecu- lar gene replication enters the macroprocess of organismic reproduction as a microscopic sub- process, which may induce imperfections in the transmission of Mendelian genes through random mutations. Finally, the dynamics of structural trans- formation in open systems may be partitioned into externally induced changes of a system's environ- mental constraints, and internal (random) perturba- tions of potentially unstable equilibria. Such per- turbations may then drive a system through a sequence of transitional states until a new stable reference state can be reached. The point is that no specific physical or biological laws have to be invoked to provide an arbitrary system with an internal dynamic of structural insta- bility. Rather, the presence of distinct levels of individual and collective behavior and the statistical nature of the relations between them represent potential sources of instability in multicomponent (i.e., complex) systems, with random deviations around macroscopic reference states as the evolu- tionary motor pattern. In order to apply this abstract scheme to processes of sociocultural development, micro- and macrolevels of human organization have to be distin- guished, and the concepts of stable state and perturbation must be specified for social systems (see Weidlich and Haag, 1983, for an excellent exposition and rigorously formal treatment of these problems). The next section of this article will do this in more detail. I will treat large-scale human socie- ties as multicomponent systems composed of indi- viduals and small-scale subgroups. These systems are "open" to the extent that they are in contact with ecological settings and undergo sociocultural exchanges with neighboring groups. The micros- tates of a society are identified with the wishes, needs, thoughts, and emotions (the psychological motivational states of social action) of its individual members, and face-to-face relations between them. Furthermore, through their joint sociocultural activi- ties, individuals contribute to the establishment of</page><page sequence="4">166 certain large-scale political, economic, and religious patterns. The communicative and institutional sub- functions of the social system coordinate and rein- force these activities. Perturbations of large-scale social relations arise from spontaneous cultural inno- vations or from individual actions that deviate from traditional patterns or that do not follow the institu- tional norms of behavior. Perturbations will thus be understood as contingent events relative to the existing social order, although probabilistic or even deterministic explanations in terms of individual psychology may be possible. Social stability is then introduced as a comparative concept based on differentials in the expected effectiveness of alterna- tive modes of social control. Evolutionary Stability of Human Social Relations In recent years, cost-benefit analyses referring to inclusive fitness differentials in human social interac- tions between individuals who are closely related genetically have proven to be increasingly important in anthropology and sociology (Chagnon and Irons, 1979; Alexander, 1979; Trivers, 1981). The approach, which has become known as human sociobiology, implies that human individuals tend to adapt to their ecological and social environments so as to promote the reproductive success of their genes, which they are likely to share with their relatives to some well- defined degree according to the respective lines of common descent. Irons (1979:9), Alexander (1979:Chap. 2), and others have argued that this type of inclusive fitness maximizing behavior applies to phylogenetically evolved as well as culturally transmitted interaction patterns. Inclusive fitness theory has been used to explain a variety of human social traits such as kinship bonding, reciprocal altruism, incest taboo, and, last but not least, politi- cal relations (Masters, 1981, 1982). Nonetheless, theoretical analyses based on be- havioral adaptations seem to have limited applica- tion to human social interactions. Human social and ecological response ranges are extraordinarily broad and behavioral cues are mediated by all kinds of sociocultural institutions, norms, and traditions. Thus, inclusive fitness, cost-benefit analyses of hu- man behavior are much more difficult to carry out than they are in optimality approaches to nonhuman behavior. In other words, with humans an infinite array of ultimate causes (ecological factors gov- erning the natural history of the species) and proxi- mate causes (environmental features faced by the individual organism) of behavior have to be specified before the question of the adaptedness of some action can reasonably be raised (Masters, 1979, 1981; Losco, 1981). In the following sections I will attempt to comply with Williams's (1974:4) postulate that adaptation (as a concept particularly difficult to operationalize in human sociobiology) should not be invoked unnec- essarily and should be attributed to no higher level of (sociocultural) organization than the evidence explicitly demands. Then I will reintroduce the notion of the evolutionary stability of social structures in order to include spatiotemporally contingent (i.e., nonadaptive) sociocultural traits in the evolutionary approach. My mode of analysis aims to describe types of social relations, that is, sufficiently abstract patterns of interaction such as hierarchy, domi- nance, or ritual so that certian sociocultural variables in these patterns can be treated as structural vari- ables. Correspondingly, a social relationship which is invariant under changing environmental or histori- cal conditions may be called structurally or, equiva- lent^, evolutionary stable against the respective perturbations in its internal or external constraints. Referring to Clarke (1978:Chap. 2) for explicit definitions of concepts such as system, variable, and environment in archaeological and anthropologi- cal terms, I concentrate on the evolutionary implica- tions of these notions here. According to ethology and sociobiology, human social relations represent networks of behavior coordination and control oper- ating on phylogenetically evolved response patterns with extraordinarily broad reaction ranges (Wilson, 1975). Broadness of reaction ranges means a geneti- cally constrained multiplicity of stimulus-response relations whose functions include physiological cues as well as institutional manipulations of human development (Dawkins, 1982:12). This interpretation views the human phylogenetic heritage as a set of instruments of social organization whose functions in cultural systems may or may not prove adaptive, i.e., they may or may not maximize reproductive fitness. Hence, phenomenological parallels between human and nonhuman behavior do not necessarily have to be understood as functional analogies through which culture simulates biological adapta- tions, as is frequently assumed in human sociobi- ology (Barash, 1977; Alexander, 1979:85; Irons, 1979:9). Such parallels may equally point to the instrumental character that phylogenetic preadapta- tions can adopt in complex cultural systems (Dawkins, 1982:62). These systems may well be nonadaptive in the sociobiological sense and yet, stable, at least for some time. In the following sections I will explain the rise of the state and complex sociocultural organizations as the culture-specific transformation of evolved face- to-face patterns of human interaction into systems of large-scale social control. I view the mode of trans- formation as a specific case of a well-known concept of cultural evolution. Flannery (1972) has called this process promotion and interprets the rise of com-</page><page sequence="5">167 plex society as the transition of special-purpose institutions into general-purpose patterns. As a model it assumes that the dynamics of early soci- ocultural evolution were nondirectional, that is, driven by historically and spatially contingent events such as spontaneous cultural innovations or other unpredictable variations in the internal or environ- mental conditions of prestate societies. Differentials in the stability of social systems arise and generate distinct levels of organizational complexity where face-to-face relations (special-purpose behaviors) become reorganized in such a way that they yield effective means of more abstract social control (general-purpose patterns or institutions). This inter- pretation of sociocultural change corresponds to a comparative method of evaluating the relative de- grees of stability in social structures. Social relations are expected to be more stable the more effectively the individuals involved utilize the motivational states of the human neurophysiological apparatus, which are preadaptive to any particular mode of sociocultural interaction. This effectiveness is the capacity of the institutional system to transform abstract norms and values into subjective psycho- logical motives by suitable arrangements of physio- logical as well as symbolic cues. My assumption that early sociocultural evolution consists in spatiotemporally contingent events does not deny that human individuals or groups may show goal-directed behavior and that patterns of social stability or change can be understood as functions of human purposes. On the other hand, some social structures are reasonably invariant de- spite certain historically and environmentally chang- ing goals of social actors. Prominent examples familiar in anthropology are the properties of political organization on which my investigation concen- trates. In other words, it is primarily a matter of conceptual topology and theoretical abstraction whether and to what extent human goals, means, and functions are made explicit. It is a conceptual commitment inherent in the structural stability ap- proach to treat them as unspecified variables rather than distinct objects of concern. Similar considerations apply to the familiar distinc- tion between structural and functional analysis and its relevance to the present mode of conceptualiza- tion. Social structures usually have discernible func- tions, and functions (specific contributions of subunits to the global state or operation of the social system) can be viewed as interaction patterns (i.e., structures). Hence, whether a social relation ap- pears as a function or a structure depends on the context. Here we concentrate on interaction pat- terns that are multifunctional in the sense that they maximize the effectiveness of social control in large- scale groups under varying sociohistorical condi- tions. My perspective differs in certain respects from R. N. Adams's (1975) distinguished interdisciplinary approach to sociocultural organization, which uses elements of biophysics, ecology, and social anthro- pology. Adams (1975:Chaps. 6, 7) stresses the importance of thermodynamic notions such as in- creases in the rate of energy dissipation in the evolution of ecosystems, but evidently he under- rates the crucial problem of the evolutionary stability of dissipative dynamic systems. Work on this prob- lem is a characteristic of modern biophysics and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Likewise, Adams's book is not specifically designed as a biobehavioral analysis of large-scale social institutions. At any rate, my work is intended not as an alternative to Adams's account but as a complementary perspec- tive on social evolution. Primordial State Formation The evolutionary approaches to political anthropol- ogy provide various models combining elements of Darwinian selection theory with certain prime-mover mechanisms of state formation (Carneiro, 1978; Al- exander, 1979). However, the prime movers of social evolution?be they internal adaptive predispositions of social systems (phylogenetic or cultural inertia; see Wilson, 1975:Chap. 3; Alexander, 1979:Chap. 2), or external (e.g., ecological) pressures?can act selectively only if diverse organic structures already exist. Competitive selection theory leaves open the question of how increasingly complex modes of self- organization can lead to evolutionary stable states in living systems. This indeed represents the most fundamental question in evolutionary theory, since the expected degrees of instability probably corre- late with the number of structural parameters in organic systems (May, 1973; Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977:462). This problem bears directly on human cultural evolution. In the systemic models of political anthro- pology, theoretical interest in the rise of the state concentrates on the ways that control processes operate in increasingly complex societies. Primitive egalitarian societies (hunter-gatherer bands, tribes of horticulturalists and primitive agriculturalists) typi- cally comprise autonomous groups formed through the familial bonds of kinship and marriage with weakly developed memories of descent and ances- tral lineage. Intragroup conflict and violence as well as intergroup aggression are by no means as rare (Ember, 1978) as some anthropologists currently maintain. Division of labor is based on age and sex. Moderately elaborate ritual is employed as a means of social communication. Some evidence from soci- obiology suggests that certain basic social traits of egalitarian societies in fact involve local adaptations of the patterns of cooperation, competition, and communication which have been selected under the</page><page sequence="6">168 specific conditions of biocultural evolution in the hominid line (Wilson, 1975; Chagnon and Irons, 1979; Baer and McEachron, 1982a, 1982b). The transition from egalitarian society to hierarchi- cal chiefdoms is marked by a conspicuous increase in average population size and internal differentia- tion of society with regard to division of labor and administrative functions. Leadership, economic wealth, and superior social rank are largely attrib- uted to noble lineages. As Flannery (1972) notes, the origins of hereditary inequality are difficult to explain. However, the elements of hereditary status arrange- ments?dominance orders and the constraints of kinship and descent?are not unique to ranked society. Comparative ethology and sociobiology suggest rather that they constitute much of homolo- gous and analogous primate social structure includ- ing human face-to-face relations. Within egalitarian kinship units, where the degrees of relatedness vary less significantly over the group, dominance hierar- chies and division of labor are indeed expected to be constrained predominantly by the preadaptations of the individual members' age and sex. In multifam- ily groups the allocation of social rank and resources to whole families rather than individuals may well represent adaptations that are relevant to an analy- sis based on inclusive fitness theory. Alexander's (1979) account of nepotism (dispensing benefits to relatives other than immediate descendants) is largely concerned with this kind of allocation. On the other hand, it is paradoxical that biosocial adapta- tions should explain the emergence of large-scale, hierarchical organizations, which, because they in- volve marked, rank-specific differences in access to goods and resources, impose conspicuously nonadaptive constraints on the survival and repro- ductive efforts of the subordinate members of the society. To be sure, inclusive fitness theory explains why group life can be beneficial even to subordinate individuals and subgroups. However, this theory cannot explain why, by virtue of cultural inheritance of social status, group life should be more advanta- geous for one concrete subgroup in the hierarchy than for most others. The situation is similar to Willhoite's (1981) "dilemmas of rank and reciproc- ity." A more adequate biosocial approach would focus on the expected stability properties of complex social structures possibly forming in a milieu of primitive egalitarian relations. The structural stability approach starts from the fact that the cross-cultural invariance of hereditary inequality is one of the most prominent features of the history of civilization. This empirical fact is interpreted as an effect of preadap- tive dispositions in human social behavior such as patterns of dominance and submission and the awareness of kinship bonds. In ranked society, however, such dispositions have been effectively extended, in culture-specific ways, beyond the range of face-to-face relations to more inclusive social units. Flannery (1972) has described culture- specific modes of depersonalizing face-to-face pat- terns as instances of promotion. Promotion is the rise of an institution from one level in the control hierarchy to another, superior level. In particular, Flannery refers to the formation of the "general- purpose" offices of chieftainship and sanctified no- ble lineages from the "special-purpose" face-to-face leadership of the informal headman in primitive hunter-gatherer society. The prevalence of promo- tion in the historical rise of stable hierarchical organi- zation can thus be explained in biobehavioral terms as an effect of the multifunctional design of preadap- tive interaction patterns for the control of both primitive and complex social relationships. Similar modes of sociocultural development recur in the formation of primary states from chiefdoms. The internal structure of states typically depends on many more characteristic parameters than that of ranked societies. Division of labor in administration and economy is largely divorced from affinal rela- tions (professional state bureaucracy; occupational specialization in agriculture, industry and trade; see Flannery, 1972; Service, 1975). Government is highly centralized, and governmental authority exists apart from the people who exercise it, that is, it rests on a coded legal system and the actual monopoly of force (Weber, 1922; Fried, 1967; Service, 1975). These virtually invariant features of political orga- nization have given rise to extensive anthropological debates (Cohen and Service, 1978; Claessen and Skalnfk, 1978) over whether the changes in various demographic, economic, and cultural conditions that parallel early state formation are the prime movers of this process. However, none of these factors pro- vides a sufficient explanation. They are not consist- ently antecedent to all of the early states known to anthropologists, nor is it possible to decide in many well-documented cases whether they represent pre- conditions or consequences of the establishment of centralized administration and political rule (Cohen, 1978). Cohen (1978:70) concludes that the striking similarities of organization to be found in primary states "so far removed from one another as Inca Peru, Ancient China, Egypt, early Europe, or pre- colonial West Africa" have to be attributed to the properties of intrinsic stability that characterize polit- ical corporate groups. Cohen's conclusion raises the following problem. Why do the basic patterns of political corporation remain invariant across cultures despite the extreme historical and geographical variations in the internal and external parameters on which they depend? Comparing social rank and stratification in prestate societies and primary states shows that the basic</page><page sequence="7">169 authority-obedience responses entering the pattern of political domination are not unique to polities. These responses have distinct roots and parallels in theocratic rule and authority in chiefdoms. In partic- ular, domination in prestate systems typically in- volves dominant-subordinate relationships rein- forced through elaborate rituals and religious practices (Flannery, 1972; Service, 1975). The transi- tion from chiefdoms to primary states involves the transformation of sympathetic ritual as a means to stimulate coherent social action into abstract legal norms. The chief's charismatic or traditional author- ity becomes attributed to state offices rather than office holders. Thus, authority is depersonalized, as Max Weber emphasized in his classic account of the forms of legitimate domination. The function of customs, traditions, and rituals that in prestate societies reinforce the social order noncoercively is largely taken over by coercive, punitive machinery, including armed forces, in political corporate groups (Weber, 1922; Fried, 1967; Service, 1975). According to this theory of early state formation, coercive power based on the state bureaucracy's monopoly of force and right to use it to resolve conflicts as well as the presence of impersonal forms of legal authority and coded law are the crucial characteristics distinguishing states from older corporate forms. This distinction parallels the distinction made above between prestate societies and states. The former are characterized by face-to- face stimuli and ritually reinforced behavior; the latter, by more abstractly codified procedures of social control and more objective sanctions. Political power and authority reorganize face-to-face modes of hierarchical behavior into an impersonal form. Thus, in early states, one observes characteristic transformations in the inputs to otherwise invariant systems of hierarchical organization. In any particu- lar case such a change might have been triggered by any conceivable, ecologically and historically contingent variation in the social structure of a ranked society. The sources of change may range from external pressures to the appearance of some powerful tribal leader, the Great Man, extending his domination over ever more inclusive groups and territories (Service, 1975; Claessen and Skalnik, 1978:621). The only recurrent pattern in these events is the result that they brought about (Cohen, 1978:70), namely, a specific reorganization of social influence and power whose stability and function in complex hierarchical systems can be traced back to selected modes of interaction between individuals. From Rites to Sanctions The "ritualization" of previously noncommunicative traits that evolved into species-specific signals is an important mode of the biological evolution of social communication (Wilson, 1975; Dawkins and Krebs, 1978). Certain general aspects in the ritualization of behavior patterns are useful in understanding hu- man sociocultural development (Wilson, 1975:224; Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1979). Ritualization implies func- tional shifts in preadaptive traits similar to the modes of sociocultural change (promotion) that are to be observed in the emergence of stratified soci- ety. In fact, in nonhuman species ritualization fre- quently leads to the establishment of extremely complicated and elaborate interaction patterns within given communicative response ranges con- strained by the genome. Furthermore, in ritualization emotional movements are turned into symbols (sig- nals) whose meanings vary with the contexts in which they are displayed in animal groups. Finally, perception and identification of species-specific stimuli and signals depend oh the detector devices and motivational states of the psychophysiological apparatus. As Wilson (1975:224) notes, in animal communication the effects of ritualization are much more frequently to be observed than the effects of the alternative process, namely, the adaptation of sensory organs and physiological releasing mecha- nisms to preexisting communicative displays. Phylogenetic ritualization may thus provide an example for the present hypothesis that evolution- ary invariant social patterns result where differential rates of change arise between evolving communica- tive and manipulative traits with high individual flexibility on the one hand and their genetic and physiological constraints, or phylogenetic inertia, on the other. This mode of differential structural change is especially significant for human biosocial evolu- tion, which involves both genomic inertia and dispro- portionally broad individual response ranges. There- fore, it is useful to examine the role of invariant biobehavioral factors in the development of legal systems and institutions out of the ritual practices and ceremonies which in prestate societies serve to maintain social order, consolidate dominance hierar- chies, and shape consent within the group (Burns and Laughlin, 1979). Because certain psychological concomitants of ritualistic patterns are nearly univer- sal, comparative ethologists and social psycholo- gists have assumed that they rest on complex but discernible biological substrata. In particular, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological ap- proaches to human ritualistic behavior seem to emphasize the sensitizing impacts of external (so- cial and physiological) Stressors on the nervous system and the constitutive functions of each hemi- sphere of the human brain in generating and screen- ing ritualistic cues, movements, and cognitive processes (d'Aquili, 1978; Lex, 1978, 1979). More- over, considerable ethological and sociobiological evidence suggests that expressive movements and the display of symbols in human ritual act to trigger phylogenetically analogous or homologous releasers</page><page sequence="8">170 that in animals and humans correlate with patterns of status signaling, aggressive displays, facial ex- pressions, intentional movements, and play behavior (Wilson, 1975; Dawkins and Krebs, 1978; Eibl- Eibesfeldt, 1979; Fagen, 1981). In the process of state formation, the communica- tive and manipulative functions of human ritual separate and are conferred on different institutions. The basic norms of the society become largely coded as laws, and the legal order tends to be reaffirmed by the repressive institutions of the state. The process involves rearrangements of preexisting, special-purpose patterns to more general modes of social control (Service, 1975:Chap. 4). Discussing nonlegal versus legal reinforcement, typical of chiefdoms and states respectively, Service stresses the increasing significance of explicit definitions of the social norms. Sanctified custom, that is, ritualis- tic interaction patterns that formerly had been su- pernaturally sanctioned in part become reduced to abstract, codified, formal law. Formalized and codi- fied modes of social regulation are particularly suit- able in groups too large and too diversified to communicate effectively their basic cultural values by means of ritualistic displays. The power structures that function to maintain social control in political corporate groups are se- lected from a number of factors that serve to stabilize human hierarchical relations, but they are selected to minimize dependency on face-to-face interactions. Recent ethological research in social primates, including humans, demonstrates that dominance hierarchies in these species express themselves in a variety of social traits ranging from dominance aggression (threats and acts of violence to reinforce differences in social status) to activities attracting social attention (Omark, et al., 1980) whose occurrence and functions in behavior control vary with ecological conditions and social contexts.2 These expressions, in turn, depend on the frequency and intensity of audiovisual contacts, including non- verbal gestures, and act as important displays in the ritualistic reinforcement of dominance hierarchies in small-scale groups. Dominance aggression de- serves special interest in this context, however, since it can easily be turned into a highly impersonal asymmetric social relationship, when tools and weapons are used in conflicts (Barash, 1977:319; Bandura, 1979; Baer and McEachron, 1982a, 1982b). The institutionalized threat of forceful sanctions characteristic of complex society functions to trans- form ritualistic cues (bullying gestures and aggres- sive emotional movements used in face-to-face en- counters) into well-organized systems of long-range social behavior control (Geiger, unpublished manu- script). This transformation offers an effective if not optimal strategy to stabilize large-scale, differenti- ated societies against structural variations in their internal and external constraints (Geiger, unpub- lished manuscript). In advanced stages of state formation this strategy is indeed perfected by the state bureaucracy's claim on the monopoly over physical force and the right to use it. Summary and Discussion I have contrasted two evolutionary approaches to human social organization. One attempts to explain sociocultural institutions in terms of biobehavioral adaptations; the other sees random structural varia- tion as the dynamics of evolution, with intermediate levels of organizational stability forming in complex systems. The first approach has caused method- ological problems to anthropology concerning the evaluation of genetic fitness gains and costs in social exchanges. These problems are difficult to solve, since adaptations in the strict sense derived from behavioral genetics may be harder to identify in social patterns the more complex the institutional system becomes. The second approach not only is consistent with the concept of evolution as increas- ing self-organization in living systems but applies to evolutionary explanations of nonadaptive social structures as well. This approach aims to clarify two hypotheses: first, that the concept of structural, or evolutionary, stability is useful in understanding the emergence of patterns of social stratification that do not vary across cultures; and second; that under arbitrarily varying historical and environmental con- ditions, sociocultural structures are more stable the more effectively they exploit selected human behav- ioral dispositions by transforming them into systems of large-scale social control. In fact, empirical data from political anthropology and comparative ethol- ogy and sociobiology suggest that the distinction between ranked and stratified society corresponds to distinct stability factors at different levels of sociocultural complexity. Biobehavioral patterns are significant of the respective stages of hierarchical differentiation. Finally, the evolutionary account of early state formation might improve theoretical understanding of the nature of political organization. The connec- tion between human face-to-face aggression and physical force as an institutionalized sanction clearly extends to the widely held view of the modern state as an institution defined in terms of the presence of repressive controls involving physical force. The fact that highly advanced and differentiated corporate groups such as the Western pluralistic state still consider recourse to the most drastic strategy of primate dominance behavior when claiming the mo- nopoly and right of violent coercive power indeed presents a challenging question to biopolitical re- search.</page><page sequence="9">171 Notes 1. The present work has been sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Bonn. A previ- ous draft of this article was presented to the Xllth World Congress of the International Political Science Association held in Rio de Janeiro in August 1982. The author wishes to thank the participants in the biopolitics panel sessions at the congress as well as Mario A. di Gregorio, Darwin College, Cambridge. Their interest in his work, comments, and criticisms have been very helpful in preparing the final version of the article. 2. Concepts of hierarchical ranking, dominance ag- gression, and attention structure have been criti- cized vigorously because of this variability and occasional lack of stable observational coherence in dominance rankings (for critical review and discus- sion see Wittenberger, 1981:591) as well as lack of logical and empirical consistency in certain exposi- tions of attention structure theory (Schubert, 1983). Nonetheless, social dominance seems an almost indispensable analytic concept of theories of con- ventional intraspecific competition.</page><page sequence="10">172 COMMENTARIES THE GEIGER ENCOUNTER AND THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF THE STATE Kenneth E. Boulding Distinguished Professor of Economics, Emeritus Research Associate and Project Director Institute of Behavioral Science University of Colorado, Boulder Boulder, Colorado 80309 There is a level of abstraction at which German and French philosophers seem to be able to breathe, but at which my intellectual lungs seem to run out of oxygen, no doubt because of my Anglo-Saxon work- ing-class background. I am not really equipped, therefore, to evaluate Gerhard Geiger's contribution at its own level. I confess that when I run into a sentence like "The prevalence of promotion in the historical rise of stable hierarchical organization can thus be explained in biobehavioral terms as an effect of the multifunctional design of preadaptive interac- tion patterns for the control of both primitive and complex social relationships" I have to gasp for breath. The ecosystem of the noosphere has islands similar to the Galapagos, which, as Darwin noted, produce a divergence of species. 1 am certainly a very different kind of intellectual finch from Dr. Geiger, even though we seem to live in the same archipelago of evolutionary theory. I must also con- fess that I am not familiar with 80 to 90 percent of his references and, as he quotes no one with whom I am familiar, including me, I assume he would have the same difficulty with my references. Nevertheless, migration of species is a very important evolutionary force; it does not even necessarily produce uncrea- tive conformity, as Australia discovered when it imported rabbits. Dr. Geiger is closer to the sociobiologists than I, though he seems ambivalent about the impact of genetic changes on the human race. His overall thesis seems to be that there are patterns in evolu- tion itself, especially societal evolution, which are independent of particular places and circumstances. At one point in the paper, where he comes down from the 18,000 foot level of abstraction, he points out that remarkably similar processes in the forma- tion of states took place in Inca Peru, ancient China, Egypt, early Europe, and pre-Colonial West Africa. There is a good deal of truth in this. There does seem to be a certain structure of ecological niches in the total ecosystem which can be filled by a variety of different forms: in Australia, the kangaroo is a kind of deer; the koala is a queer kind of squirrel; the bandicoot, a sort of rat; the wombat, perhaps a kind of badger. In the Oceanic Islands, like Mauritius or New Zealand, which the mammals did not reach until human intervention, birds occupied many of the apparently mammalian niches. It is thus not surpris- ing to find a somewhat similar phenomenon in social systems. Buddhism in Japan in the sixth century occupied much the same social niche that Christian- ity did in northern Europe at about the same time. The many striking parallels, for instance, between the history of Japan and the history of, say, England in the last two thousand years, with virtually no contact until the nineteenth century, suggests that even evolutionary patterns over time have certain structures that are more probable than others. All this, however, should be a conclusion of the theory of evolution and not a premise. One looks in</page><page sequence="11">173 vain in Dr. Geiger's paper for such a theory. He seems to reject, and quite rightly, the sort of deter- ministic inclusive fitness stuff that comes from the more naive sociobiologists, but he does not seem to find any substitute. My own view is that we must distinguish two kinds of genetic processes. First there is biogenetic evolution. This is highly Mendelian; there is a reper- toire of possible mutations, but the exact point at which any ?tern in the repertoire happens is a highly random process with profound evolutionary effects. Well before the emergence of the human race, a second genetic process is apparent, which I have called "noogenetics" (from "nous"). These are the learned structures and behaviors which are transmit- ted from one generation to the next by a learning process, based, of course, on the potentials of biogenetically created nervous systems. There is some rather dubious evidence for this in the planaria. There is no question about it in birds, who have to learn a good part of their bird song. As we move to the mammals, the concept of noogenetics becomes increasingly important, as the capacity for learning increases with the size and potential of the central nervous system. In the human race noogenetics is overwhelming. There is very little evidence that the overall biological gene pool of the human race has altered substantially in the last 50,000 years. Given sexual reproduction and large populations, any biogenetic mutation will be scat- tered through the population in relatively few gener- ations. Even if one is descended from William the Conqueror, the chance of having one of his genes is very small, which seems to indicate the relative unimportance of biogenetic fitness in the human race. Another piece of evidence to this effect would be the remarkable persistence of homosexuality. If it has a biogenetic base, one would expect it to become extinct very rapidly, as its reproductive fitness is very low indeed. Noogenetic evolution is highly Lamarckian. The experience of the phenotype is precisely what is transmitted to the next generation. Human knowl- edge and know-how is the genetic structure behind the invention and production of human artifacts of all kinds, including material artifacts, e.g., swords or automobiles; organizational artifacts, e.g., house- holds, tribes, states, churches, and corporations; and human beings themselves, who are in part biological artifacts from the biogenetic equipment, but also in large part social artifacts in terms of language, knowledge structures, skills, and know- how. There is certainly no biogenetic gene for the English language, although there is presumably a biogenetic origin for our capacity for learning lan- guage. Noogenetic, like biogenetic, evolution, proceeds by mutation and selection. Both biological and soci- etal evolution can be identified as a very complex process of ecological interaction, i.e., selection. This takes place under conditions of constantly changing parameters, i.e., mutation. In biological evolution, a change in parameters may consist of genetic muta- tion producing a new type of organism, or pheno- type. Mutation, however, may also include changes in climate, soil erosion, and the physical environ- ment. In societal evolution, mutation takes the form of new ideas, new knowledge, new discoveries, new inventions, new skills. The human artifact is the phenotype. The know-how that produces it is the genotype. Humans, however, have a capacity that no other living organism on the earth possesses, a capacity for "know-what"?the developing of images of the structure and relationship of a real world in an approximation to all its vast complexity. The rise of the subculture of science, specializing in the increase of know-what, has had an enormous impact on the evolutionary process. Virtually no biological species on earth has been unaffected by it, and it has resulted in an enormous acceleration of the evolutionary process itself. This is a very recent phenomenon; science-based technology hardly dates before 1860. Nevertheless, it has already had an impact on the whole solar system in terms of human artifacts. The whole biosphere of earth is changing at an unprecedented rate as a result of human intervention. Ecological interaction is the interaction (chemical, biological, and social) of populations of different species of all kinds. These interactions rest on a complex structure of relationships: on food chains; on input-output cycles, like the nitrogen cycle or the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle; on adaptability of spe- cies, which is a function of the information-know-how system. Here the human race has, in the short run, an enormous advantage. This advantage may not, of course, save us from extinction, since our capacity for know-what is rapidly giving us the capacity to exterminate ourselves and perhaps to bring the whole evolutionary process on earth to an end in nuclear war. The only thing that may prevent such an end is "know-whether," i.e., moral valuations and taboos. There are three main ecological interactions be- tween two populations: mutual competition, in which an increase in either diminishes the other, which is somewhat unstable, although possible; mutual co- operation, in which an increase in either increases the other, leading to higher levels of both popula- tions; and pr?dation, in which an increase in the predator diminishes the predatee and an increase in the predatee increases the predator. Pr?dation is a fairly stable interaction. If the parameters of the system remain constant for a while, there is a</page><page sequence="12">174 tendency for the different populations to move to an equilibrium (neglecting migration for the moment) at which births equal deaths. The equilibrium popula- tion is what should be meant by a "niche." A very important concept in evolution is that of the "empty niche": a species that, if it existed, would have an equilibrium population in an ecosystem. It is clear, for instance, that Australia had an empty niche for rabbits in the nineteenth century and that the world had an empty niche for automobiles in 1880, which did not exist in 1840, as there was no gasoline. When an empty niche is filled, it alters the whole ecosystem, diminishing some species, in- creasing others, and creating new empty niches. This is how evolution proceeds. An empty niche is an opportunity for a mutation, but, if the niche is not filled, it may eventually disappear, thus altering the course of history. This is why evolution is essentially an indeterministic process, depending on the exact dates at which improbable events, like DNA itself or the human race, happen. We ask ourselves, therefore, at what point in the evolution of society did an empty niche for the state appear? What previous mutations gave rise to it? These are not easy questions to answer because of the complexity of the system, but we can certainly make some suggestions. It seems fairly certain that no niche for the state is possible unless there is a surplus of storable food beyond what the food producers themselves eat. In hunting/gathering so- cieties, food surpluses come and go. Even in socie- ties in a very rich environment, like the Kwakiutl of British Columbia, food is not very storable. There is a kind of food chain of human artifacts here of which the classical economists were well aware, though modern economics seems to have forgotten it. Farm- ers produce a surplus of grain beyond what they eat themselves. The grain can be fed to cows to pro- duce milk. It can be fed, together with leather, to shoemakers and it produces shoes. The shoes may make it easier to produce the grains, and so in- crease the surplus. Complex processes of both positive and negative feedback are involved here, which often lead to development, i.e., an increase in human knowledge, know-how and artifacts. A very important development was the filling of the empty niche for agriculture about 10,000 years ago. Why this did not happen 20,000 or 30,000 years ago is a bit of a puzzle. There is perhaps something in the view that it could not happen before a biogenetic mutation in wild grains made it possible to cultivate them. Once agriculture did develop, the surplus of storable food increased enormously, which created an empty niche for the state. The filling of this empty niche, like any other, requires mutation, that is, social invention. It may also require inventions of human artifacts, such as weaponry. It was only after the invention of agriculture that metallurgy, pottery, weaving developed; all possible because of the storable and transportable food surplus which agriculture and the domestication of animals provided. I have argued that there are three very fundamen- tal human relationships: the threat system, which begins when the threatener says to the threatened, "You do something I want or I will do something that you do not want." This obviously depends on the capacity to do something that somebody else does not want. In the paleolithic period, this capacity may not have been very high. With the development of agriculture and the food surplus, metallurgy, and weaponry, this capacity increased. The second ba- sic system is that of exchange, which originates when A says to B, "You do something I want and I will do something you want." Or, "I will give you something and you give me something." This de- pends on the existence of things people want, such as commodities, and on the capacity to produce them, which in turn depends on a certain amount of division of labor and specialization. Some people make one thing and some people another, and then exchange them. Adam Smith pointed out that ex- change leads to the division of labor, which leads to more exchange, which leads to a further division of labor, and so on, in what today is called a positive feedback. The third social relationship is the integra- tive system, which involves legitimacy, persuasion, status, ritual, in which A says to B, "You do some- thing because of what I am and what you are and how we both visualize our identities and roles." All actual relationships are mixtures of threat, exchange, and integrative relationships in different proportions. Early civilizations seem to have been based on a fairly high proportion of integrative relation. Nearly all the early state-like structures seem to have been priesthoods, which depended on the ability of the priests to persuade the farmers, particularly, that if they did not perform their rituals the crops would not grow. The farmers were thus persuaded to give a portion of their crop to the priest, with which the priest fed not only himself but fed builders, weavers, potters, all the people who created the apparatus of the temple, which en- hanced still further the persuasiveness of the priest. The priest, however, nearly always seems to have been replaced by the king, with a high proportion of threat. The Biblical story of Samuel being replaced by Saul seems to have been an imitation of some- thing that happened earlier among other peoples. The king, in effect, says to the farmer, "Give me part of your crop or my soldiers will kill you." With the crop that he gets the king is able to feed his soldiers, so that this is a pretty stable structure. A stable structure in this sense is the ability to capture</page><page sequence="13">175 part of the food surplus and to use it in forms which perpetuate the ability to capture it, whether this is in the integrative ("spiritual threat") system of the priest or the "physical threat system" of the king. Just why the priest is succeeded by the king is a tricky question. There is a strong element of threat in many organized religions, and there must be strong integrative elements in the state, such as patriotism, identification, and legitimacy. War, unfortunately, helps these internal integrative elements, but also produces what I have called the "sacrifice trap": if we make sacrifices for something, it is very hard to admit that we were wrong. Up to a point, therefore, sacrifices increase the legitimacy of the institution on behalf of which the sacrifices were made. The niche for the legal structures and bureaucra- cies which are so characteristic of the state is opened up by the development of writing. This not only creates an elite class of the literate, it also enormously extends the power of communication over long distances. Organization depends on com- munication. Indeed, the development of the state could almost be termed the first "organizational revolution," as a result of improvement in communi- cation techniques through writing and the sending of written documents by means of travel. It is no accident that virtually all the first states were on rivers, which are a cheap and easy form of travel and communication. The Incas are a curious exception to this, but they maintained communication by runners on mountain paths carrying the quipa (instructions). Evolutionary theory also provides for the indeter- minacy of the rare event; the appearance of the unusual leader, the Sargon or Alexander or Darius, who by charisma and energy is able to occupy the niches by forming organizations, and by establish- ing communications which earlier technology has opened up. Considering the impact of the threat systems, both the nature of weaponry and the nature of communications is important, but there is also a fundamental principle of the diminution of threat over distance, which limits its operation. Here again, in early civilizations, river travel was of great importance for the transport of threat systems. We see this at a later time in the formation of the sea empires, as sea transportation became feasible. The Roman Empire was based on a combination of Mediterranean sea transport and the road system. The Spanish, Portuguese, and British Empires de- pended very much on oceangoing technology, which opened up all the coasts of the world to the potential imperial power. The long process of back-and-forth technical change, such as that between offensive weapons and defensive structures, also plays an important role in the development of the state. The feudal system, both in Europe and in Japan, rested on the capacity of defensive structures like the castle or city walls to offset short-range weapons like the bow and arrow and the spear. The development of gunpowder and the effective cannon brought the feudal system to an end within almost a generation, as the lord who stayed in his castle got blown up with it. The nuclear weapon is now doing something similar to the national state. It has made national defense the greatest enemy of national security. I have tried to show that evolutionary theory can have content and that the content is found only in intermediate levels of abstraction. It is certainly true, as Dr. Geiger suggests, that there are macro sys- tems that transcend the peculiarities of the individ- ual micro systems. These macro systems, however, are not determinate over time, for they do depend on the time at which improbable events happen, and this timing has a profound effect on the nature of the macro system. These evolutionary macro systems are not simple cause and effect systems. They are ecological systems. In ecosystems (which I have sometimes called "echo systems") a particular act or event echoes and reverberates all around the system and the final outcome is unpredictable. This does not mean that all is chaos. There is a great deal of order in the evolutionary process. But that order is a qualified and tentative order. Predictions and plans must be made, but must also be constantly modified. DYNAMICAL 'EVOLUTIONARY99 THEORIES FOR POLITICAL SCIENCE Michael R. Rose Department of Biology Dalhousie University Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada B3H4J1 The problem of the origin of the state is one of the most clearly defined problems of political science. As presented, for example, by Service (1975), the transition from tribal society to extensive territorial dominion with institutionalized authority (the "state") has evidently occurred independently on</page><page sequence="14">176 several occasions, and at least somewhat autono- mously on many more. Any fundamental theory of political dynamics should, accordingly, be able to account for the origin of the state. Conversely, any theory which can account for the origin of the state in mechanistic terms, as opposed to mere historical narrative or correlation, must command the attention of all those interested in political science. Geiger implies that he has developed such theory, or at least the rudiments of such theory. At a minimum, Geiger attempts to bring forward a set of ideas out of which, presumably, such theory might be constructed. Within this set, Geiger distinguishes between two different types of "evolutionary" theory for human social organization: biobehavioral adapta- tion and emergent structures in open systems. The former subset is more familiar under the label of "human sociobiology," while the latter can be seen as an outgrowth of general system theory, as initi- ated by von Bertalanffy (1968), and carried on, often under different rubrics, by many of those cited by Geiger, such as Thorn and Prigogine. At times, it seems as if Geiger is advocating the exclusive adoption of the latter approach, while at other points the article seems to make use of sociobiological reasoning (for example, in the concluding section, "Biobehavioral patterns are significant of the respec- tive stages of hierarchical differentiation"). On the whole, however, the article is clearly in the style of the systems holists, eschewing sociobiological re- duction of human behavior in Darwinian terms. In the tradition of systems writing, what Geiger has given us is a stew of disparate ideas strung together in a way which is plausible, intuitively appealing, but ultimately unsatisfying. There is very little in Geiger's essay with which one can specifi- cally disagree. This is partly because there is very little which is specific, but it is, for the most part, because we are given a series of "soft-focus" generalizations which are virtually platitudinous, if not tautologous. Geiger, like most of us, "views the origin of the state as the result of a complicated interplay of various social, cultural, and ecological factors. These factors are treated as random vari- ables whose actual specification of and impact on social structures depend on particular historical and spatial conditions." It could fairly be said that this statement comes at the outset of Geiger's discus- sion, with the detailed proposals coming later. How- ever, in proceeding from such introductory remarks to the concluding summary, I found no concrete and detailed ideas. Geiger calls to our attention a prob- lem of great significance and offers a set of general conceptual frameworks for treating it, largely follow- ing the spirit, if not the particular language, of general system theory. If this was his goal, he has succeeded. I want more, but not more of the same. What is needed is a concretely formulated dynamical theory which can deal with the origin of the state. Accord- ingly, I propose to discuss briefly the problems and prospects for the development of such theory. At the outset, let me clarify how I believe such theory should be constructed. Three basic requirements should be acceptable to most scientists: (i) a set of clear and explicit assumptions; (ii) deductive devel- opment of the theory, ideally in mathematical form; and (iii) a set of predictions, not necessarily quanti- tative, but testable in some fashion. Examples less distant than the obvious ones of physics can be found in introductory texts in population genetics or classical microeconomics. These fields are similar to political science in the complexity of subject matter and the lack of precise constants (e.g., the speed of light) which make physics such a haven for the theoretically-minded. Nonetheless, these fields have the kind of relatively successful, dynamical, mecha- nistic theories which I would like to see in political science. At present, the prospects for such theory in political science are not a matter of philosophical fantasy. A candidate theory has surfaced during the last ten years, one which Geiger himself has brought to our attention: human sociobiology. As will be well- known to the reader, this theory has generated some of the most vicious controversy seen in biol- ogy in some time (Caplan, 1978). Nonetheless, the history of science as a whole, particularly the stun- ning and repeated successes of reductionism, sug- gests that this theoretical approach has to be addressed in terms of its scientific merits, whatever philosophical distate it may arouse. I do not have any simple conclusions to offer, only a series of questions and possibilities which I wish to raise. The most profound problem with human sociobi- ology is that it is anthropomorphic. Much of evolu- tionary biology, and certainly much of E.O. Wilson's sociobiology, is firmly grounded in theories and experiments which focus more on insects than on any other type of organism. For a long time, popula- tion genetics in the U.S. was primarily a branch of Drosophila genetics. Sociobiology's greatest suc- cess has been the explanation of patterns of hymen- opteran sociality. Thus the most fundamental ques- tion for the application of sociobiology to human politics is the extent to which Homo fits the insect model of social behavior. If man does fit this model, and conscious experience and the like are unimpor- tant epiphenomena, then human sociobiology is hardly worth distinguishing from ant or bird sociobi- ology. It would be just another part of the complete edifice of sociobiology. The problem of the origin of the state in particular could be cast in the same context as the origin of hymenopteran hives, with their complex "monarchical" organization.</page><page sequence="15">177 Most evolutionary biologists, and no doubt most sociobiologists, would unhesitatingly answer this question in the negative. Human social behavior is not plausibly explained in the same terms as that of ants. The implict consensus is instead that some form(s) of immanent fitness-calculation enable hu- man beings to respond to the available opportuni- ties for fitness-enhancement in ways which are not directly genetically encoded. The attempt has been to ignore this disparity in mechanism, and treat the "fitness logic" of human behavior in the same theoretical terms as that of any other species. To the extent that this treatment is well-founded, the funda- mental theory of political dynamics must be Darwin- ian, with political acts explicable solely in terms of perceived fitness-benefits. The research of Hirsh- leifer (1977, 1982) constitutes perhaps the most cogent elaboration of this point of view. On the face of it, there is no reason why work of this kind could not ultimately treat the problem of the origin of the state in game-theoretic germs, very much in the spirit of Hobbes' Leviathan. A third point, which I have made before (Rose, 1983), is that even if human behavior is internally fitness-motivated, it may have evolved toward a degree of complexity and instability which makes analysis of overt behavior in terms of fitness un- sound. If this is the case, history would become "a tale told by an idiot," except in circumstances of great simplicity and straightforward consequences. (I have suggested that the free-market may provide such circumstances [Rose, 1983]). From this view- point, if there is any order to be found in the origin of the state, it may reside in precisely the sort of emergent properties of complex systems that Gei- ger has discussed. In this respect, I am sympathetic to his approach. A theory based on such emergent properties, however, requires mathematical analysis, which in turn requires model formulation in terms of specific elements which are thought to generate the underlying dynamics. Such elements must comprise concrete hypotheses concerning "human nature" or its equivalent, rather than general clouds of words. Human sociobiologists and economists have such models. It is incumbent upon those like Geiger to provide them too.</page><page sequence="16">178 AUTHOR'S RESPONSE HIERARCHICAL DIFFERENTIATION VERSUS ADAPTATIVE CHANGE: A NOOSPHERIC ENCOUNTER IN POLITICAL ANTHROPOLOGY I can all too readily identify with Kenneth Boulding's statements regarding the rarified levels of intellec- tual abstraction to which some German and French philosophers are prone. I, too, dislike the sort of philosophy he has in mind and so take the liberty of attributing his discomfort to the style of my English rather than to the philosophy of my article. Therefore I shall first rephrase the section of the article which Boulding quotes in a more straightforward way. This is, I think, a good starting point for my response to both commentaries. Following anthropologist Kent Flannery, I suggest that the prevailing mode of the evolution of complex stratified society is promotion rather than (Darwin- ian) adaptation. Flannery's concept of promotion can, in turn, be extended to biobehavioral notions in the following way. According to sociobiology theory, there is non-zero genetic variance in a variety of human social traits, leaving these traits adaptive in small-scale, primitive human groups exposed to strong ecological pressure. However, human behav- ioral reaction ranges are generally broad, that is, multifunctional. Social response patterns such as kin altruism, ritualized communication, dominance-sub- mission interactions, etc., may thus serve functions for which they have not been designed by natural selection. In other words, they may control adaptive and non-adaptive, primitive and complex social rela- tions. Promotion then includes preadaptive func- tional changes in human social behavior and social control, i.e., the transformation of adaptive behaviors into non-adaptive ones in sociocultural contexts. The concept of promotion is significant to evolu- tionary anthropology for at least two reasons. First, it provides anthropology theory with a conceptual framework to describe the dynamics of increasing hierarchical complexity of socio-cultural systems. Like any other structure in the living world, social structures tend to change in ways which, from certain research perspectives, are reasonably as- sumed to be indeterministic. Differential stability and survival of newly arising systems then depend on the capacity of each particular system to reorganize existing ("preadaptive") modes of social behavior control. All that I am saying in the article is that the trial-and-error dynamics of evolution governs not only biophysical processes but also increasingly complex hierarchical organization in cultural history. In particular, I propose a comparative concept of the stability of large-scale, complex social systems, using it to evaluate the (tentative) success of evolu- tionary steps in sociohistorical contexts. The con- cept relates to biobehavioral preadaptations of cul- ture and, as I try to show, may help to explain the coincidence of the historical rise of large-scale so- cial groups on the one hand and political power as an institutionalized sanction on the other. It might be the case that this point is obscured by "clouds of words" in the article, as Michael Rose believes. But I can see no justification for his conclu- sion that my account does not cope with the dynam- ics of the evolution of political society. Rather, from his own remarks on biological and cultural evolution, I think that he underrates the significance of an otherwise familiar evolutionary principle called "or- der through fluctuations" by llya Prigogine and his colleagues. It states that the ultimate driving force of</page><page sequence="17">179 all evolutionary change toward increasing hierarchi- cal complexity is random perturbation of structures in the prebiotic and living world. Kenneth Boulding seems to be more ready than Michael Rose to concede that randomly induced perturbations of complex structures and systems constitute primary dynamical effects of organic as well as cultural evolution. The second advantage the concept of promotion, or functional shift, offers to theoretical anthropology is this concept's compatibility with indeterministic evolutionary theories. By indeterministic, or stochas- tic, theories I mean theories whose empirical postu- lates do not consist of (deterministic) cause-effect implications. For example, many, though not all, of the statistical and probabilistic theories in natural and social science are indeterministic. This type of theory suggestes itself to historical disciplines be- cause historical events, such as the invention of noogenetics or the Geiger counter, are highly singu- lar and cannot be attributed to identifiable causes in definite ways. Theories of promotion in evolutionary anthropology can avoid these partly logical and partly observational difficulties. The changes in so- cial patterns and functions with which theories of promotion are concerned may be intrinsically ran- dom. What these theories can do, then, is to assign differential attributes (e.g., stability properties) to the outcomes of historical events and processes, how- ever improbable each particular event may be. Ac- cording to the methodological standards of empiri- cal science, nothing is required here except that the assignments are hypotheses testable by observa- tion. As for my account of state origin, I indeed do not offer a deterministic theory. Rather, my argument runs as follows. Whatever the spatio-temporally con- tingent "causes" of the formation of large-scale social groups may be, those forms of complex social organization that will prove the historically most significant are ones that we usually subsume under the concepts of political organization and state. Logically, this hypothesis is based on considera- tions of the stability of social structures. Institutional- ized (or "legal") authority is easier to maintain in large groups than charismatic authority (Max Weber's argument) although the former is the histor- ical, cultural transformation of the latter. In a similar fashion, I compare codified with ritualized social norms, coercive power with face-to-face aggression, etc. Empirically, the hypothesis I have obtained from these comparisons can be, and has been, tested against the findings of anthropological field studies (see relevant items in the references cited). My paper clearly does not intend to add further observa- tional evidence to what is already known about state origin. But I think I can offer a theoretical framework suitable to explain well-known empirical facts in evolutionary terms. Both commentators outline evolutionary, biosocial alternatives to my view of political anthropology. These relate to familiar concepts of evolutionary ecology and genetics, such as natural selection, niche variation and adaptive radiation, and inclusive fitness. In this respect, they follow previous evolu- tionary approaches to state origin by Robert Carneiro, Richard Alexander, and Roger Masters, to name a few. Although I think that these approaches give us a profound understanding of the ultimate motives of human social behavior in general, I have my reservations about their suitability to account for the biocultural evolution of complex political society. The point is that, from their historic origins on, stable social stratification, political power, and political domination involve differences in culturally heredi- tary social status that frequently impose extreme differences in survival and reproductive success on the individuals in the society. Political organizations like the state may in fact serve the biological needs of human individuals and group. But ancient and modern states sometimes do this differentially, namely, by discriminating against large numbers of their own citizens. And often enough social justice and social iniquity take on one and the same political form. My account of state origin is designed to understand this very political form rather than the biological basis (inclusive-fitness motivation) of the individuals' striving for social justice. If inclusive-fitness theory cannot explain more to us that what is good "according to nature" (e.g., Masters, 1982), it is of little use in understanding "the nature of the state" because, as an empirical fact, so many states in cultural history are, accord- ing to nature, flagrantly bad. It may therefore be worthwhile to reinterpret Machiavelli, rather than Aristotle, in biosocial terms. After all, it was the great Italian philosopher and statesman who not only observed "the great changes in things which we have seen, and every day see, happen contrary to all human expectation" (fortuna) but also pointed out the ways human institutions can increase their power of enduring in a world of uncertainty. ?Gebhard Geiger References Adams, R. ?.
