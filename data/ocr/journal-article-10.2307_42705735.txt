Paul Dennithorne Johnston* The word is not the thing. - Alfred Korzybski, semanticist, circa 1933 Oh death, where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling! - Brendan Behan, playwright, circa 1956 A good reporter gives just the facts, without bias, opinion, or emotional manipulation. These guidelines were established long ago by the tabloid TV greats of the 20th century. Although I am an aging political hack, I make no apologies for my inevitable cynicism. However, in the Profiles that I write, I will not let per- sonal prejudices stand in the way of honest journalism and the truth. - Heraldo Irreverent, journalist, circa 2295 * Paul Dennithorne Johnston, concerned humorist, serves as Executive Director of ISGS. Here, he continues to explore humor and fiction as a means of creating more awareness of general semantics. Copyright 138 ° 1999 Paul D. Johnston.</page><page sequence="2">The Word is not the Sting, or is it? 139 Profile of a Tyrant ONG ago, pre-humans discovered that group cooperation - 1 J enhanced survival. Primitive civilization had begun. From dumb mass consciousness, individuals emerged to dominate the pack. As societies evolved, hierarchical relations became the norm. Leaders did not necessarily seek power to achieve fame and fortune, or to change the world for better or worse. Some just couldn't stand mediocre idiots bossing them around. This journalist can empathize with those who hunger for genu- ine power. I am sick of being snubbed, castigated, slandered, sued, and punched in the nose, and I would love to destroy cer- tain self-righteous megalomaniac media colleagues. If you don't want people giving you orders, you get on top so they can't. A drudge with a flair for psychology (such as this journalist) will have observed that throughout the course of history many tyrants, bullies, dictators, and assorted powermongers were short in stature. And fat, too. To use professional psychiatric parlance, they resembled frogs. Napoleon, for example. Churchill. Marie Antoinette. Kermit. Well, Kermit actually had anthropomorphic tendencies. Behind many great leaders is the inferiority complex, the result of physical mediocrity or downright ugliness, and perhaps certain abuses from parents, siblings, the proletariat, the state, the fates, the economy, or idealized media imagery. When most media fig- ures are stunningly beautiful and you look amphibian, it's enough to turn you Machiavellian.</page><page sequence="3">140 ETC • Summer 1999 Such a person was dictator M. E. O'Wally, CEO of Earth and Environs. Informed sources have revealed to this scrivener even more secrets about that evil ugly freak and his mission to destroy language in human beings. O'Wally knew that in the struggle to dominate others, a most powerful weapon is language. An important factor in O'Wally's rise to power was his rabble-rousing speech based on Hamlet's "to be or not to be" soliloquy. The tyrant had long obeyed the unwritten law that said both dictators and democratically elected presidents must unceasingly immerse the populace in a barrage of lies, illogic, and empty exhortations. As the saying goes: propa- gandize or perish. Yes, guns and bombs provide a means of killing those who stand in your way. But first you must use language. With words, you can gather a following. You must bully, bluster, cajole, per- suade, prod, urge, and convince others to pay for, produce, or use your swords or guns or bombs. Thus did Alexander the Great. Thus did Hitler. Thus did most presidents, prime ministers, and other politicians. They told lies, and called it spin, and after a while everyone accepted such deceptions, along with taxes, death, bad weather, and indigestion. High Abstractions , Low Responsibility As a powermonger, you must hypnotize the people with abstractions so high and vague that you cannot be held responsi- ble for anything you've said. M. E. O'Wally, known also as "Mack," though no one dared call him that to his face, was one who had perfected the art of the meaningless message: words meant not for communication or interaction, but for projection only; words as weapons, shields, sedatives, and smoke screens. His own diary shows how much he had learned from Clint Billious, founder of Spin Doctors Incor- porated, prince of propaganda, past master of verbal corruption. A reliable source has revealed that O'Wally had a shameful secret. In fact O'Wally had once killed a friend who'd merely</page><page sequence="4">The Word is not the Sting, or is it? 141 hinted he knew it. As usual, O'Wally had used his wits, and that death was recorded as an accident. Now, this scribe is free to reveal that dreadful deadly secret. O'Wally was half clone. With some brilliant computer hacking, O'Wally had changed his birth records, and created for himself a new all-human iden- tity. What made O'Wally dangerous was this: he believed that words ruled facts. He believed that if he said it is so, it is so. In short, he believed that the word is the thing. Had he not proved this by changing his records, thus becoming the human he'd always longed to bel Some of O'Wally's psychopathology we can trace to his upbringing. An outcast, half clone, half human, he grew up under an angry, spiteful, dispossessed, brutal, full-clone father who had little income, no prospects, and no respect. The family of O'Wally's human mother had disowned her after the lovers had eloped to one of the few asteroids that would perform a mar- riage between clone and human. The O'Wallys had the social status of a family of slugs. Limbo A clone married to a human usually lived in limbo. Rejected by both clone and human society, O'Wally Senior could rarely get work, and when he did, it paid little. He could make a few credits collecting various types of human waste and carrying it to a recycling center. Those credits he often spent on synthohol, leaving almost nothing for food. Growing up, young O'Wally had often gone hungry. "You're not hungry!" his father would yell. The boy would listen to his grumbling stomach and feel the hunger pains knotting up inside. "I'm not hungry," he'd repeat to himself until the pain went away or he fainted. When his father beat him, he would repeat, "It doesn't hurt. It doesn 't hurt. "</page><page sequence="5">142 ETC • Summer 1999 His mother was forced to work as a verbal prostitute, a pain- less but humiliating livelihood because at that time the only respectable form of synthetic sex was produced entirely by com- puter. Disillusioned, despondent, sick, and exhausted, Mrs. O'Wally would connect herself to the virtual valium machine for days on end, and young O'Wally would plunge into fear, loneli- ness, and despair. He'd tell himself he didn't care, and eventually he taught himself to feel no sympathetic pain, and to ignore any pain of his own. O'Wally learned at an early age to anesthetize himself with words to make a wretched world go away. The family lived in a tenement, a filthy cage of ramshackle prefabs bolted onto the side of a run-down industrial artificial planet &lt; click here i&gt;. Many of the occupants of this nether- world longed for upward mobility to the local slums, but young O'Wally had set his goals much higher. &lt;1&gt; The grandiose term "artificial planet" is certainly a mis- nomer. It applies to any space object over a kilometer in diameter, as long as it is man-made, hollowish, and more or less roundish somewhere. If it is not as described above, you must call it an "asteroid." If it is as described above but smaller and it also fits another set of confusing and contra- dictory parameters, you must call it a "station." These legal definitions were foisted upon the universe by the French delegation of the UN Committee for the Equaliza- tion of Language because the French had never forgiven the Yanks for railroading through a resolution making le hot dog a legal unit of the French language. The term "nation" also became greatly diluted early in the 23rd century. According to the Geneva Convention of 2225 (so-called because it was held in Amsterdam and most of the participants were continually drunk on Geneva gin), nation was defined as follows: "... any planet, object, or land mass (the term 'land mass' was penciled in as an afterthought) having independent boundaries, or its boundaries sur- rounded by at least ten times its own volume of empty space, orbiting, and not self-powered, or part of a larger orbiting</page><page sequence="6">The Word is not the Sting, or is it? 143 structure, or not." (A motion from California to additionally define "nation" as "a state of mind" lost by two votes.) We must also credit O'Wally's ruthlessness to a factor beyond upbringing and environment: he hated just about everybody. He loved to hate. Hating gave him more pleasure than almost any- thing, except perhaps intimidating someone, or inflicting pain, or arranging the elimination of an opponent. He did like to watch people squirm. Vague Definitions O'Wally's early acquisition of wealth came though clever she- nanigans in space real estate and he took advantage of those vague legal definitions of planets, nations, etc. Although some owners proclaimed nationhood for their space stations or asteroid homesteads, this made little difference when O'Wally decided to blow such structures out of the way in his quest for more wealth and power. Young O'Wally had vowed he would never again go hungry, or be laughed at, or wear dirty clothes. It took him several years and murders to make his pledge come true. In later life, he killed several men who'd laughed at him, and one who'd suffered an attack of hiccups at the wrong time. However, no one suspected that he'd committed his first murder at the age of twelve until he boasted about it in his infamous diary. Like many of his claims, this was a partial lie. He'd actually committed his first murder when he was thirteen. In his late teens, O'Wally bought and sold repossessed space stations, then asteroids, then planets. He studied history. When a population impeded a real estate deal, he deleted it. O'Wally took the art of unethical cleansing &lt; click here 2&gt; to new depths, as he emulated that twentieth century strategist Milos the Balkinator, an overlord who had once tricked Clint Billious and NUTO into doing some of his dirty work for him.</page><page sequence="7">144 ETC • Summer 1999 &lt;2&gt; Unethical cleansing was actually invented by the invad- ers of North America, who long before the Balkan conflicts had evicted the indigenous populations from their home ter- ritories and imprisoned the survivors in euphemistically labeled "reservations." Later, the authorities decided such actions were politically incorrect. They modestly gave up tak- ing credit for their invention, and attempted to punish any- one who now used it, justifying their actions with suitably self-righteous propaganda from sincere press officers and crisp military persons with surgically sterile vocabularies. Still young, O'Wally made another fortune in space transport. This often required bribery to get space-route permission, or the unauthorized demolition of space habitation between hubs. O'Wally enjoyed this work. When blowing up artificial planets, he liked to push the button himself, uttering that phrase he made so famous, "To be or not. " O'Wally would proclaim his intent to perform a power move, and then with bullying, bribery, or bombs, make it come true. His word became the thing. The Price of Words An over-reliance on verbal constructions had its price. When O'Wally said it was so, he had to make it so, for example, when he said to an opponent, "You're dead." At times, following through on such details became very burdensome. Eventually, O'Wally was truly hoist with his own patois, as he who believed in words, could not separate verbal fact from verbal fiction. Especially if someone had put the matter in writing. And for many decades, academics had studied and written about, and many vulgars had professed to believe, the Myth of the Unlicensed Clone. This myth said that one day a black-market clone would appear to challenge the status quo, bring down dictators, and initiate a new age of freedom for all enslaved peoples, especially clones.</page><page sequence="8">The Word is not the Sting, or is it? 145 The myth also said that this clone would kill his father and marry his own mother. This part of the myth seemed inconsistent with the fact that a clone has neither father nor mother, but when it comes to myths, who needs consistency? In addition, the myth said that the person responsible for the death of this heroic clone would suffer dreadful personal disaster. When O'Wally succeeded in his hostile takeover of Baseball Planet Inc. , his spies discovered that aboard the Baseball Planet a clone had been produced without license from stolen DNA. Informed sources say that this revelation caused O'Wally to believe that the Myth of the Unlicensed Clone was about to come true. O'Wally fell into a funk of paralyzing fear, dread, and para- noia. If the myth came true, he would lose his empire. He would probably die, too. Real War TV O'Wally, a brilliant strategist, only used soldiers or bombs as a last resort. However, when he had to go to war, he'd boost finances by selling the media rights to Real War TV. (One of his smaller wars received an Oscar for best production, but since only real people died, no Oscars were awarded for good acting.) To supplement his war of words, he used various economic weapons, including the hostile takeover. And he encouraged the people to become addicted to anything: shopping, work, child- bearing, drugs, anger, love, virtual entertainment, synthetic sex, emotional trip-outs, day-trading, ownership of things and people, verbal intoxication, etc. He sponsored violence in holocaster entertainment and news reporting because symbolic violence leads to the real thing, bringing division to society, and facilitating his practice of divide and rule. He worked unceasingly to create a society of desensi- tized, cowardly, conflict-hungry violence-voyeurs so hyped up on real and virtual violence that no one had any morals at all.</page><page sequence="9">146 ETC • Summer 1999 Yet none of those weapons he'd used so successfully in the past brought him comfort now. The Myth of the Unlicensed Clone turned his cold heart to ice. He knew his own death was near. He could not sleep. He could not eat. He locked himself in his num- ber five orbiting penthouse, conducted his business by voice phone, and wouldn't see anyone. Reliable sources say he let his hair and fingernails grow so long that he looked like a wild old crazy man. Half naked, he would wander distractedly around the room muttering deliriously "O Death, how much thy sting?" He tried obsessively to negotiate with Death a leveraged buyout that included some extremely valuable stock options. Everywhere O 'Wally looked, he saw clones. Eventually, O'Wally gave orders for his disciplinary operatives to find and kill the clone Pang Lawws. This made him feel safe, and he sent for his barber and mani- curist and told them to give him the works.
