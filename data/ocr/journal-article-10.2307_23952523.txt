<plain_text><page sequence="1">78 REVIEWS Kant's Conception of God: A Critical Exposition of its Metaphysical Development, together with a translation of the Nova Dilucidatio, by F. E. England, M.A., Ph.D. (George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., London, 1929.) There will perhaps always be room for new books on Kant's philo sophy, and it will always be possible for the writers of them to advance the thought of their own generation while elucidating or criticizing the work of this genius of a past age. This is because Kant's shortcomings, errors, and inconsistencies are somehow more instructive and suggestive than many of the sound and final pronouncements of lesser philosophers. Dr England's book is certainly a contribution to natural theology as well as a valuable commentary on Kant. It is one of the few in our own language which deal especially with Kant's theology. It is so excellent in quality that one could wish that it had been more volumi nous, and that it had more completely covered the ground by taking some notice of the Religion within the bounds of reason alone, and by dis cussing more fully the as yet little known Opus postumum. But students of Kant will be grateful to Dr England for what he has been pleased to give them, viz. an examination of the three Critiques and some of Kant's precritical writings, in so far as they are concerned with the conception of God. These works, after all, are theologically the most important. Many students will also thank the author for the first translation into English of Kant's earliest philosophical treatise, the Principiorum primo rum cognitionis meiaphysicae nova dilucidatio. Dr England's first chapter supplies a concise and clear exposition of the philosophical situation in the time of Kant's youth. The author then traces Kant's transition from the Wolffian type of rationalism, in which he was brought up but which from the first does not seem to have completely satisfied him, to the 'critical' point of view. He here dis cusses fully Kant's early recognition of the truths that existence is no predicate but rather consists in the ' absolute positing ' of a thing, and that the notion of the possible, or of what is conceivable without contra diction, presupposes the notion of some actuality : truths which had been overlooked, but which are important in connexion with certain proofs of the existence of God. Dr England seems to me to follow the rather common tendency to broaden out the ontological argument so that it includes an argument such as that called e contingentia tnundi, which is surely distinguishable from it. The ontological argument, if it be an</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 79 argument of one kind only, unique and different from other theistic arguments, is simply the inference from the idea of Deity, or of the most perfect being, to the existence of that Being. That possibilities pre suppose some actuality is not the same proposition as that they presup pose one particular actuality, viz. God ; and until it is shewn that all actual things other than God presuppose His actuality, the mere fact that possibility presupposes actuality can yield no theistic conclusion. Hence the objections, urged by Ward, to the argument of Kant's Der Einzig mogliche Beweisgrund u. s. w. Dr England thinks that Ward here missed the meaning of the Kantian phrase 'absolute positing'. That may be so ; but if ' absolute positing ' does not mean mere exis tence on the part of a thing but its grounding in ' the fount of all reality additional considerations as to dependence of contingent things on this fount are involved in any argument from the possible to God. Such considerations may be forthcoming, but they are, as it seems to me, no part of the argument that is properly called ontological. So, if Kant thought, as Dr England states (p. 55), that the true significance of the ontological argument is that we must affirm the existence of God as the presupposition of all possibility, I should venture to say that Kant then bestowed the name of ' the ontological argument ' upon an argument of a kind different from that which he elsewhere calls by that name. Dr England, however, is of opinion (pp. 123-124) that when Kant elsewhere criticizes what I should call the ontological argument pure and simple—that the idea of God includes His existence—Kant 'reveals an extraordinarily imperfect grasp of the significance of the argument as such '. And he continues : ' Doubtless also Anselm failed to show how even in regard to God an existential conclusion can follow from analytical premises. Yet the real question involved in Anselm's argument is as to whether we must posit a supreme Urgrund or ens realissimum in some form as the necessary presupposition of things, and to this important aspect of the argument Kant gives1 a thorough assent.' Perhaps I am devoting an undue amount of space to a relatively small point ; but I cannot help thinking that it would conduce to clearness if philosophers would distinguish, not as different aspects of one argument, but as two different and independent lines of argument, the attempt to extract existence out of an idea and the attempt to prove a ' necessary ' ground for ' contingent ' things. So long as this distinction is not drawn, substitutes for the ontological argument will continue to be called rehabilitations of it. It is when the first and third of Kant's critiques receive the searching examination which Dr England bestows upon them that the main thesis of this book begins to reveal itself. This is that the negative conclusions 1 In the context which Dr England is now discussing.</page><page sequence="3">8o THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES as to the validity of the metaphysical concept of God, to which Kant was led, do not really follow from the first principles of the critical philosophy when these principles are strictly interpreted and loyally obeyed : Kant's negations are rather due to the persistence, in his philo sophy as a whole, of non-critical, and indeed chiefly precritical or rational istic, modes of thought. Just as Prof. Ward, in his concise Study of Kant, shewed that if Kant's ' logomorphic ' deduction of the categories of substance and cause be discarded as futile, and Kant's own clear hints as to their ' anthropomorphic ' origination be followed, the critical theory of knowledge becomes a coherent exposition of human inter pretativeness, so Dr England shews that if certain precritical suppositions and certain unwarrantable hard lines of distinction, where we can now see continuity, be eliminated, much of Kant's polemic concerning the teleological category and the conception of God becomes misdirected and vain. Dr England concludes that even the cosmological argument admits of being restated in a form consistent with ' critical ' principles : ' if it be granted that all our concepts ', whether called constitutive categories of the understanding or regulative ideas of the reason, ' are justified by their indispensableness for the task of organizing experience, then the concept to which the cosmological argument points must be admitted as a concept of something real '. One may not be convinced as to the possibility of thus reviving the particular theistic argument known as the cosmological ; but in the case of the teleological argument there is much less room for hesitation. Dr England brings out very clearly the almost pitiable shifts to which Kant put himself in order to avoid being compelled to abandon his distinction between a regulative idea and a constitutive category when confronted with the facts concern ing the adaptations in organisms. It is still a considerable step from the internal adaptiveness of organisms to external design of the cosmos, but Dr England goes on to argue that inner purposiveness (adaptedness) implies a designing mind. Perhaps his chapter on the purposiveness displayed in Nature may be singled out as the most important and original among many good chapters. It is followed by an examination of Kant's moral argument, in which less room is afforded for new com ment, and by a final chapter on the idea of God as ultimate ground. It is concluded that in view of the unity, the conformity to law, and the adaptedness to ends including morality, which the world displays, the conception of God as its ground is essential for a complete interpretation of all the facts. More than this the natural theologian who sets out from facts and ends by interpreting them can hardly maintain. Kant, however, fell far short of maintaining this ; largely, as Dr England thinks, because of his unduly agnostic attitude towards the noumenal, as distinct from the phenomenal, partly because he persisted in trying to</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 8l conceive of God on the lines of his rationalistic predecessors, and partly because he never seems to have asked himself what conception of God must be adopted for the explanation, as a totality, of the different realms of fact which he tended to keep distinct. I have the less reluctantly passed over many of the particular con tributions which this book makes because I hope that I have said enough to indicate that it is one which every student of philosophical theology should read.</page></plain_text>
