<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXV, No. 23 NOVEMBER 10, 1938 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ELEMENTS OF UNINTELLIGIBILITY IN WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE IN PROCESS AND REALITY I T HAT there was a measure of disappointment in the philosophical world on the appearance of Process and Reality can scarcely be denied. The anticipations aroused by Whitehead's previous works -his profound critique of a mechanical physics, his unusual sensi- tiveness to the world of qualities and values, the promise of an organicist metaphysics-all these led us to expect great things from his speculative intuitions and constructions. The fact that he had given us such a satisfactory Concept of Nature, led us to hope that he would give us an equally satisfactory and intelligible concept of reality. Instead, despite its great interest and real fascination, Process and Reality-one can only say it with the profoundest regret-proved to be almost the most unintelligible essay in philos- ophy ever written. In saying this one risks, of course, the charge, by the initiated, of simply displaying the limitations of one's own unenlightened mind. What is still worse, one risks the charge of being guilty of a highly ungracious, not to say impious, act. I should risk neither were it not for the fact that I am convinced that, despite the elements of unintelligibility in his philosophy, Whitehead's intuitions and ideas are of great intrinsic as well as human importance. Of this importance there can be, I think, no reasonable doubt. His pro- found critique of mechanical physics (including his doctrine of extensive abstraction, as developed in the Concept of Nature) has served, I think, to put into philosophical form some of the conse- quences of recent physics in a way which no other philosophical writing has done. Above all, his explicit recognition of the basal character of the metaphysical problem as different from that of science-as concerned with the two problems of the relation of the "eternal objects" to the time process, and ultimately of value to existence-has fitted him, as few scientific minds of our time, to make significant contributions to the rehabilitation and reinterpretation of metaphysics which must inevitably come. 617</page><page sequence="2">618 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY For these reasons it is, then, all the more to be regretted that his own essay in metaphysics should be thus lacking in intelligibility. If I am guilty of saying ungracious things it is because I believe that something very much more is involved than the criticism of the philosophy of one man, however significant and important. As I shall hope to show, these elements of unintelligibility are due, in part at least, to a certain philosophy of language, widely held in the modern world, and to certain notions of intelligibility that result. Whitehead's philosophy is in many respects symptomatic of these tendencies, and in criticizing him I am really raising the entire ques- tion of the relation of language to science and philosophy. Of the importance of these issues Whitehead is, as we shall see, fully aware. I am sure that the questions I shall here raise are such as he himself has grappled with and that, should he by any chance read this paper, he will welcome an attempt, however imperfect and inade- quate, to state them. II A. The Linguistic Unintelligibility of Process and Reality Philosophers notoriously have difficulty in making themselves intelligible to the non-philosophical and even to their fellow philos- ophers. The reasons for this are well understood; and Professor Whitehead has at a number of points given voice, somewhat patheti- cally, to his distress. "The language of literature breaks down," he tells us, "precisely at the task of expressing in explicit form the larger generalities-the very generalities which metaphysics seeks to express. Metaphysics deals with those notions that are relevant to the most general aspects of experience. Ordinary language was however made to deal with particulars." There is enough truth in this statement to make us all realize that certain difficulties in philo- sophical language are inevitable. A certain initial linguistic difficulty is therefore to be expected in metaphysical works of the deeper sort. But this unintelligibility reaches quite unusual proportions in the writings of Professor Whitehead. It is unfair to tear single passages from their contexts. But even single passages should have some connotation, should sug- gest at least some filaments of meaning which tempt us to run them out. I choose one at random from hundreds of a similar nature. "The primordial created fact is the unconditioned conceptual valua- tion of the entire multiplicity of eternal objects. This is the pri- mordial nature of God. By reason of this complete valuation, the objectification of God in each derivative actual entity results in a graduation of the relevance of eternal objects to the concreseent</page><page sequence="3">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 619 phases of that derivative occasion" 1 . . and so on. Surely there is no spark of meaning that springs directly from this conglomeration of words. It is, in its first intention at least, linguistically opaque and unintelligible. Such things, it may be said, have happened in philosophy before. Kant, in pouring new wine into the old bottles of Scholastic termi- nology, produced a "barbarous" language which was at first unintel- ligible, but which later justified itself. From the pages of Hegel passages may perhaps be torn no less unintelligible at the beginning than these of Whitehead. Is it not conceivable that we shall in time understand the Whitehead idiom as well as these? It is possible, but I do not think so-for reasons, we shall see, that lie deep in the very premises of Whitehead's thinking. All these men have made new words, have in a sense redesigned our language to make it suitable for philosophy, but not in the radical sense of Whitehead. To this radical character of his linguistic revolution we shall now turn. B. Sources of Whitehead's Philosophy of Language The basal assumption of Whitehead's philosophy is the inability of natural language to express reality. It breaks down, we have seen, precisely at the task of expressing in explicit form the larger generalities. Thus for him "philosophy must redesign language in the same way that in physical science pre-existing appliances are re- designed. " This general position is the product of two tendencies in modern thought, both of which have greatly influenced Whitehead. The first of these is that of Bergson from whom, he admits, the organicist philosophy has got its main insights. Natural language was made to handle the static and can not grasp the dynamic; it is not "moulded on reality." Bergson concludes, rightly on his premises, that we should not try to express reality in linguistic symbol, but use language only poetically to bring us to the point where we may intuit directly the Duration which escapes language. The other source is the "New Logic" which tells us that ordi- nary language, and the natural logic derived from it, distort reality and must therefore be abandoned for non-linguistic symbols, the ideal being a mathematical description which would not be subject to the demand of retranslation into the natural language of common sense. Bertrand Russell, for instance, starts from these premises: "I say," he writes, "I sit at the table." But I ought to say: " One of a certain string of events causally connected in the sort of way 1Process and Reality, p. 46. Unless otherwise stated, all references here- after are to this book.</page><page sequence="4">620 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that makes the whole series that is called a 'person' has a certain spatial relation to one of another string of events causally connected with one another in a different way and having a spatial configura- tion of the sort denoted by the word table. I do not say so because life is too short; but that is what I should say if I were a true philosopher. " Professor Whitehead is influenced by both tendencies but is con- tent to draw neither conclusion. He will be neither a mere poet nor a mere mathematical logician. Instead he proposes to redesign meta- physical language and he sets out blithely to carry out this Herculean task. For him life is not too short as it is for Mr. Russell. He will be a "true philosopher"-in the modern style-and at all costs, with the result that he has created an entirely new language-one which extrudes from metaphysical discourse all those concepts and categories which hitherto have made communication from mind to mind possible. He has designed an entirely new idiom which, as we shall see, in an important sense turns the older idiom upside down. Such a proposal in itself gives one furiously to think. The sug- gestion itself-to redesign language as pre-existing appliances in physics are redesigned-suggests an innocence as to the nature and possibilities of language which makes us gasp. In any case it in- dicates the primary reason for that astounding initial meaningless- ness of so many of his passages, for the feeling of intellectual giddiness-not wholly unlike that produced by the later writings of Joyce-which flows over us as we read Process and Reality. This parallel is not so far-fetched as it may at first seem. In fact the redesigning of language in both cases follows from much the same premises and assumptions.2 III A. The Reasons for the Redesigning of Language This principle of the redesigning of language involves conse- quences of tremendous importance. It involves, as Whitehead says, a drastic revision of all the categories and an entirely new meta- physics. "All modern philosophy," he tells us, "hinges about the difficulty of describing the world in terms of subject and predicate, substance and quality, particular and universal. The result always does violence to immediate experience" (p. 78). Like many other moderns, he tells us, "this language expresses a useful abstract for many purposes of life. But whenever we try to use it as a funda- 2 The parallel here suggested has not escaped the notice of others. Mr. Wyndham Lewis in his penetrating book, Time and the Western Man, has indeed made the same point with convincing detail.</page><page sequence="5">WWHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 621 mental statement of the nature of things it proves itself mistaken." For the employment of the subject-predicate notion in language and logic there is, as stated above, "a sound pragmatic defense. But in metaphysics, the concept is pure error" (p. 122). For this reason Whitehead's thinking proceeds upon a rather wholesale condemnation of all that has hitherto been thought and written in philosophy. Taken as a whole, we are told, his philos- ophy of organism goes back to Pre-Kantian modes of thought. But all these (Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, and Hume) are permeated with error. Hume, we are told, despite his sceptical nominalism, never moved from the subject-predicate habits of thought. Both Locke and Hume failed to realize that their problem required a more drastic revision of traditional categories than they actually effected. As a result we find, especially in Hume, "a vagueness and incon- sistency" arising from the fact that "he proceeds on the tacit pre- supposition of the mind as subject and of its contents as predicates, a presupposition which he explicitly repudiates" (p. 80). This wholesale revision of the categories we shall examine pres- ently. For the moment let us consider the reasons for the redesign- ing of language. These, as stated above, are two: (1) That lan- guage (natural language) expresses a useful abstract for life, but is in error when it seeks to express the nature of things. In other words, language was made solely for practice-or the pragmatic view of language. (2) It does not express the true nature of things. In other words, to use Bergson's terms, it is not "moulded on real- ity. " The very suggestion that language should be redesigned as pre- existing physical appliances are redesigned can not but be shocking to any right-minded lover of language and its expressiveness. And yet it is a logical consequence of a widely held view of the nature and origin of language. The notion that language is an extension of the "tool-making function of intelligence" underlies both of the philosophies from which Whitehead has drawn his inspiration. This assumption is unquestioned in many quarters, but I believe it to be not so much the result of an actual study of language and its functions for its own sake, as an illegitimate inference from certain conceptions of evolution. I believe that language was made pri- marily for expression and that this function is even more primary than that of practice. But even if it were first made for the ma- nipulation of things, it does not at all follow that this is its primary, still less its sole function now. To so argue would be a rather egre- gious case of the genetic fallacy. I believe this to be an inadequate, if not wholly false, philosophy of language, but I can not go into that here. I will go straight to the main issue.</page><page sequence="6">622 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY B. Language Not Moulded on Reality The reason why it is proposed to redesign language completely is, then, that while it expresses a useful abstract for the purposes of life, when we try to use it as a fundamental statement of the nature of things it proves itself mistaken. Language is not moulded on reality and for this reason any attempt to express it in ordinary language "distorts reality." The tacit assumption here-and this is the basal assumption underlying Whitehead's entire philosophy of language-is that we somehow know the fundamental nature of things apart from lan- guage and its categories and can then turn back and see that lan- guage does not correspond. We may then well ask where do we get this knowledge and what is the nature of the knowledge given? The answer is that we get it from science, more particularly modern physics, and we know the fundamental nature of reality to be of the nature of "events. " For reasons well known to all, Whitehead abandons the tradi- tional "concept of nature" of the physicist. In place of the sub- stantial material entities persisting through time and moving in space, he substitutes as the ultimate components of reality a very different kind of entity and this he describes as " events. " In the language of science, it is the displacement of the notion of static stuff by the notion of fluent energy. In the language of philosophy it is the displacement of static categories by dynamic. Now obviously such a standpoint involves a very complete trans- formation of the conceptual foundations of science-a drastic re- vision of all its basal categories. For Newtonian science-and for Kant who sought to develop the "philosophy" of that science-cer- tain concepts or categories, preeminently those of substance and causality, were constitutive of the very life of science as such. Not only was the subject-predicate relation a priori in the sense that it was the necessary condition of intelligible expression and communi- cation as such, but this same relation, schematized into that of sub- stance and attribute, was the necessary condition of an intelligible science. This Whitehead, following modern science, seeks to revise. Even in science there are, of course, difficulties. We can, for instance, not really think or talk very easily about "events" in Whitehead's sense. For, as he himself tells us, their characteristic is that they make their entry only in order to make their exit. About such an entity it is very difficult to say anything, and if we say anything at all we seem condemned to the very inconsistency which Whitehead deplores in Hume. Planck's hypothesis of dis- crete and disembodied quanta of energy is, for instance, a case in</page><page sequence="7">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 623 point. The hypothesis affirms action without specifying anything to act, unless the word "energy" is given all the physical attributes of matter. A quantity of radiant energy is then really an old friend, a corpuscle of light masquerading under a new name, in which case we are really using the old categories. There are, then, even in science certain difficulties in the way of the redesigning of the old categories. Yet despite these difficulties we may admit that, on certain assumptions, such redesigning is both conceivable and feasible. The chief of these assumptions is that science is purely opera- tional in character, that it deals merely with symbols and is under no compulsion to retranslate its scientific mathematical formulas into the language of ordinary communication. In other words, that this "instrumental intelligibility," as we may call it, is all that we desire. In that case we might, if we wished, reverse completely the structure of language and the thought processes connected with it, because we do not wish to "understand," but merely to control and predict. It is, of course, hard for the natural mind to think forces without things that move, but it can be done. It is quite another matter, however, when we wish to "understand." It is not so easily possible, for instance, to think feelings without some- thing or some one that feels. To say, for instance, with White- head, that "the feeler is the emergent of his feelings" is not so pos- sible and comes near to being, as we shall see, unintelligible non- sense. In other words, on a purely operational view of the nature of scientific concepts, a drastic redesigning of language, and a dras- tic revision of the categories might be possible, whereas a similar reconstruction in other regions of expression and communication, and a fortiori in metaphysics, might not be feasible. I should, per- haps, make it clear that I do not myself believe that the conceptual foundations of science can be so completely changed, for I do not believe that a purely operational theory of science is tenable. Neither, for that matter, does Whitehead if I understand him aright. I do not believe that the fundamental categories have as yet been, or can finally be, extruded from scientific discourse, but that is another story. My point here is that, even if it were pos- sible in science, it could not necessarily be done in metaphysics. These considerations lead me, however, to the second assumption that seems to underlie Whitehead's thinking on this point. When he tells us that language is not "moulded on reality" and must be redesigned, what is the "reality" and what is it that must determine the redesigning? The tacit assumption running throughout is, I think, that it is reality as determined by science, more especially physics. This is the more difficult to understand in Whitehead for</page><page sequence="8">624 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the reason that it seems to go counter to one of the main elements in his teaching, namely, the denial of the primacy of science in meta- physical construction. I had thought that it is precisely this that he challenges in Science and the Modern World. But if you will look closely, you will see that the proposal to redesign language is really not for the purpose of making it fit experience, but rather the notions of modern physics. I confess I can not see why, if philoso- phy went wrong when it "took off its hat" and was subservient to Newtonian physics, we have any guarantee that it may now make the same error, when it revises all its categories to fit the analysis of modern physics. In any case-and this is the sole point I wish to make here-the reality on which Whitehead would have us re- design our language and categories is the reality of physics, and intelligibility in physical science is made normative for philosophy. IV A. Whitehead's New Categorical Scheme We have now seen the reasons for the redesigning of language as proposed by Whitehead. Our initial doubt of the rationality of the proposal to redesign language as a pre-existing appliance in physics is redesigned, is rather increased than decreased when we consider the reasons for the redesigning. In any case, it is wholly clear that language, when thus redesigned, is bound to produce pre- cisely the linguistic unintelligibility found in Whitehead's writing. If such redesigning of our language involves, as he rightly main- tains, a wholesale revision of all the categories, such a revision is bound to bring about a blockade of communication and understand- ing. Chapter II of Process and Reality is given over to what is called "a new categorical scheme." An adequate treatment of this chapter (with its eight categories of existence and twenty-seven categories of explanation) would in itself require a book. How much the over-powering mass of detail of this chapter contributes to the mere linguistic unintelligibility of the book, all those must realize who have attempted the excruciating preliminary discipline of learning these categories, and the almost superhuman task of carrying them along through the reading of the book. But of this I will say no more. I will consider rather the principle involved in the redesigning and the consequences which follow from it. These consequences are twofold: (a) the extrusion from metaphysical dis- course of the basal categories which have hitherto made communi- cation from mind to mind possible; and (b) that which is more significant, a revision of the categories which turns these older cate- gories upside down.</page><page sequence="9">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 625 Let us see, then, more concretely what actually happens in White- head 's philosophy. For the category of substance we have the category of the "actual occasion," for the category of inherence that of "ingression," for the category of thinghood, that of "con- crescence. " Let us note first of all the nature of the revision. It is in the direction of a language of pure dynamism-to use an expression already employed. The universe having been pulverized into "events," language must be pulverized into verbs. We must try to talk wholly in terms of verbs, and if we can't form an intelligible language in this fashion, we must constantly remember that we are speaking falsely. In Whitehead's system, there is no "thing" and nothing has or does anything. There is no thing and nothing has any quality. I do not see green, but green, so speak, "greens" me. Let us first see that this is but an extension and further applica- tion of a notion fundamental to Bergson's philosophy of language. The mind, in order to grasp things, he tells us, develops three kinds of representations, or categories, namely, forms or essences, quali- ties and acts. These ways of seeing things correspond to the three grammatical categories, nouns, adjectives, verbs. Nouns and adjec- tives symbolize states; they can represent only the static. But if reality is not static, as Bergson holds it is not, nouns and adjectives can only misrepresent reality. The burden, therefore, falls on the verb. The verb also, according to Bergson, when used as a symbol, together with the other linguistic symbols as in the subject-predicate form, also turns movement into a state, in order to apprehend and grasp it. The verb also is a name for a state. Bergson has an illustration of this point. We say the child becomes man. But in this proposition "becomes," he tells us, "is a verb of indeterminate meaning, intended to mask the absurdity into which we fall when we attribute the state man to the subject child." The truth is, he con- tinues, that if language were moulded on reality, we should not say this but rather "there is becoming between man and child." 3 For Bergson to be is to become, and language, only in so far as it ex- presses becoming, in any way represents reality. This attempt to use a language wholly of verbs, so to speak, is everywhere present in Whitehead 's philosophy and constantly produces that linguistic confusion and unintelligibility so char- acteristic of the work. But it is especially evident in connection with one basal and important element in his system, namely, the notion of feeling and the feeler. Feeling, for reasons which we shall see more fully presently, is a basal element in Whitehead's system. 3 Creative Evolution (English translation), p. 303.</page><page sequence="10">626 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Every actual occasion, every prehension, has its element of feeling. Now in conformity with his principle of the redesigning of language and his abandonment of subjects and substances he must turn ordi- nary language upside down. Ordinary language can not talk of a feeling which is not had by a feeler. Substance-attribute language is here indispensable, in some form, for intelligibility. But, we are told, "the feeler is the unity emergent from its own feelings." Now I do not profess to understand what this means. I understand the words but I get no sense. But this is not my point; this may be due to the limitations of my own intelligence. My point is rather this. If he actually used his redesigned language consistently-if he ac- tually constantly thought in terms of these new categories-we should at least understand what he is saying, even if what is said approaches at times perilously near the non-sensical. But this is just what he does not do. He is constantly being tricked-by the truth shall we say ?-into another kind of language. These very feelings, from which the "feeler" is said to emerge, are constantly given the char- acter of the feeler-with the result that our confusion becomes twice confounded. He is subject to the same fatality which followed Hume, and which Whitehead deprecates-that necessity which com- pelled Hume to speak of the self as a complex of impressions and at the same time as that which has the impressions. Now I would not be misunderstood. There is, to be sure, nothing illegal in changing names and categories in this fashion-although one sometimes wishes that there were something left of the old "fear of changing God-given names." Freedom of definition, of assump- tion and postulation, is, I suppose, one of the inalienable rights of modern man, won for him by the New Logic. But this is not the question. The question is whether, with this reversal of all natural speech construction, it is really possible to talk intelligibly, whether it is possible to communicate reality intelligibly. I submit that Whitehead 's attempt is not encouraging. The linguistic unintelligibility with which we started-and which no one would probably challenge-is due precisely to this attempt to create a new language and to revise the categories in such a fashion. It would be highly presumptuous to say that we can never talk this language, as it would be presumptuous of me to say that we shall never see things the way the impressionist or the surrealist in art sees them. What I do say-and I feel inclined to say it with conviction- is that such ways of seeing and saying things can not remain perma- nent. For, after all, there are limits to the redesigning of both forms and words, and those limits seem to be set by the conditions of intelligible communication. Long ago the Greeks discovered that "pure dynamism" could</page><page sequence="11">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 627 not be made intelligible. If reality makes its entry only to take its exit, there is nothing to grasp and no knowledge is possible. This was made specific in Aristotle's doctrine of the categories and con- firmed by Kant. Whatever we may say critically of the "deduction of the categories"-and into those questions I have no desire to go here-the essence of that deduction was to show that without certain forms or categories knowledge and, as Kant himself said, intelligible communication, is impossible. From time to time this fundamental insight is impugned, but I think lnever successfully for long. On the premises of pure dynamism-that there is more in becoming than in being-Bergson's position is the only tenable one. He does not really attempt to redesign the categories; he abandons them for mystical intuition. Whitehead seems to accept the premises but refuses to accept the consequences. I am well aware, of course, that he attempts to combine becoming with the "eternal objects," but I do not believe that the attempt is successful. V A. Linguistic Intelligibility and Philosophical Intelligibility Thus far in our argument we have been concerned solely with the nature and sources of what I have described as the linguistic unin- telligibility of Process and Reality. But the sources lie even deeper than this linguistic and categorial level. I am quite sure that, even if we could handle Whitehead's idiom as easily or naturally as the Kantian, for instance, we should still not be able to "follow him." The world, as he conceives it, would still be ununderstandable. Back of this linguistic and categorical unintelligibility lies a still more fundamental philosophical unintelligibility. Or, better expressed perhaps, the very linguistic unintelligibility which we have been ex- amining itself springs from this more fundamental source. The reasons for this are to be found, I think, in Professor White- head's own uncertainty as to what constitutes such intelligibility. Let me state it in this general fashion first. As a scientist he has learned one ideal or norm of intelligibility and intelligible expression, namely, the impersonal ideal of mathe- matics. As a man, and as one conversant with poets and philos- ophers, he has also learned another. But I think it is fair to say that he has never been able to fuse or to relate the two. He is constantly vacillating between these two ideals. As a consequence, he confuses himself and us, and it becomes very difficult to under- stand him. Let us see how this is so. It was long ago discovered -by Plato and Aristotle, to go back no further-that the source of meaning and intelligibility is ultimately value. This insight</page><page sequence="12">628 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY may be expressed in the following way: the only thing that is ultimately intelligible to us (intrinsically intelligible) is a will directed towards the good or value. Hence arose the conviction that if there is any meaning to be found in the universe at all, values must be the clue to our search for it. This, as I have elsewhere tried to show at length, constitutes the driving force-the ideal and criterion of intelligibility-of all traditional philosophy. It was not unnatural that in that philosophy mind and personality should be given a privileged position, that the mental should be more im- mediately intelligible than the non-mental, the personal than the impersonal. If traditional philosophy is anthropomorphic in this general sense, as is constantly maintained, it is so precisely because such anthropomorphism is a necessary consequence of its ideal of intelligibility. From time to time, however, this ideal is subjected to attack. We are tempted to think that the impersonal is more intelligible than the personal, entities and relations from which all values have been abstracted more intelligible than the concrete wholes from which the abstractions have been made. The attempt is therefore constantly made to construct systems in which personality appears as one deriva- tive element emerging from the substratum of impersonal reality, and values from that which is " value-free." As every one knows, this process has been progressive since the birth of modern science in Galileo. In its first stages it eliminated qualities and values as subjective and anthropomorphic, and in so doing abandoned the traditional concept of intelligibility. As the movement proceeded the notions of substance and causality, as well as those of end and purpose, have been eliminated as no less anthropomorphic. So that intelligibility in science consists now exclusively in necessary con- nections. "The fact is no longer isolated and it is therefore in- telligible. "4 These two contrasting ideals of intelligibility have fought an age-old battle for the suffrages of the thinker. If one chooses the first (gives a privileged position to mind) the world does come to appear intelligible. At least it is a meaningful world of purpose or teleology. If one chooses the second (the way of the various naturalisms and realisms) the world may not become very meaning- ful, but it becomes at least describable and a certain intelligibility- in the sense of mere lucidity of relations-is achieved. Now I think 4 Miss L. S. Stebbing, from whom this quotation is taken (A Modern In- troduction to Logic, p. 392), explicitly says that this is all intelligibility in science now means. Doubtless, she is right. In my book, The Intelligible World, I have maintained the same position. My point here is that intelligi- bility, as so conceived, is not, and never can be, intelligibility as it is under- stood in philosophy.</page><page sequence="13">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 629 one or other of these two ideals or norms must ultimately be pri- mary. Here, as elsewhere, one can not serve two masters. This was fully realized by traditional philosophy, for which, from Plato on, the principle of the primacy of values, with all that it implies, was the determining factor. It is also fully realized by modern natural- ism whenever it is consistent. For naturalism, the extrusion of values as subjective and of value language as anthropomorphic is again the determining principle. The difficulty with Whitehead's thinking, as indeed with much of modern thought, is that he tries to serve two masters. The deeper unintelligibility of Process and Reality arises out of a confusion of these two modes of thought-a confusion which I can not help feeling is "vicious." In a sense he is a victim of his own magnificence of mind. He himself has some- where said that it is better for a philosopher to be obscure than inadequate, and I rather agree with him. But the demand for adequacy can scarcely justify the combination of incompatibles, and there is always the question whether obscurity dare quite reach the proportions of Process and Reality. There can, I think, be no question as to which principle he actually considers primary. Thus in his lectures on Nature and Life (p. 9), in speaking of the Newtonian physics, he says, "Newton's methodology of physics was an overwhelming success. But the forces which he introduced still left Nature without meaning and value. He thus illustrated a great philosophic truth, that a dead nature can give no reasons. All ultimate reasons are in terms of aim at value." This quotation is but one of many such statements throughout his works. In this fundamental conception which under- lies all his metaphysical thinking-and of which more will be said presently-Whitehead has, I think, shown one of his profoundest in- sights, and this principle of intelligibility is in a sense for him also the master light of all his seeing. But the other principle of in- telligibility is constantly asserting itself and as constantly neutral- izing the primary principle. The result is that in actual practice Whitehead is constantly vacillating between the two norms and the result in endless confusion.5 5 This conflict of two principles of intelligibility in Whitehead 's thinking is shown most completely, it seems to me, in his latest statement on his philos- ophy as a whole, namely, his "Remarks," at the time of the session devoted to his philosophy at the meeting of the American Philosophical Association in 1936, and published in the Philosophical Beview, Vol. XLVI (1937), pp. 179-186. "We must end," he says, "with my first love-Symbolic Logic. When in the distant future the subject has expanded, so as to examine patterns depending on connections other than those of space, number, and quantity-when this ex- pansion has occurred, I suggest that Symbolic Logic, that is to say, the sym- bolic examination of pattern with the use of real variables, will become the</page><page sequence="14">630 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This confusion appears at numerous points throughout the book. But, as we should expect, there are certain crucial points-namely, his use of the notion of the mental, especially of the concepts of feel- ing and valuation-where it is most in evidence. As every one who has read Process and Reality realizes these notions have been com- pletely redesigned-and it is indeed the peculiar use of these no- tions which has so much to do with the merely linguistic unintelligi- bility of so many of the passages. He has redesigned them-often completely out of all recognition-with the consequence that we have great difficulty in knowing just what we are talking about. B. Mind in Whitehead's Philosophy Let us begin then with the general notion of the mental. It is generally agreed that in the history of space-time, consciousness, or the mental, appears as the quality of certain organisms at a very advanced stage of development. It seems probable that its earliest appearance was in the form of some dim awareness of feeling. However that may be, it is surely certain that self-consciousness (and personality) are the condition of those values which, on the traditional view of intelligibility, are taken as the clue to the inter- pretation of the universe. Now it follows from this that the less conscious anything is, the less penetrable and intelligible it is to us. In other words, the pre-conscious stages of evolutionary development are not intelligible per se, but only as leading up to finite conscious- ness alnd personality. Now Whitehead, as we have said, works with two notions or ideals of intelligibility. On the assumptions of one of these, he must make these pre-conscious stages intrinsically intelligible and he tries to exhibit them as such. But at certain crucial points he is tricked by the truth into making use of the opposite principle-almost it would seem unawares. Just as we saw him constantly tricked into using subject-predicate categories, so here, despite his impersonal foundation of aesthetics. From that stage it will proceed to conquer ethics and theology." To me this passage is as enlightening as it is staggering. It is significant that symbolic logic-and all that it implies-is his first love, his first ideal or norm of intelligibility. If he ends with it, then the second norm falls into the background. It is thus enlightening but it is also staggering. For to say that symbolic logic, however developed, can conquer esthetics, to say nothing of ethics and theology, is, it seems to me, in principle to go contrary to all that he has been saying hitherto. In any case, I can not understand what this can possibly mean. For it has always seemed to me that the very essence of the esthetic experience, to say nothing of the ethical, is that it catches something in reality-qualities and values-which always slips through the meshes of our logical nets, no matter how fine we may make them. And it was this, I had thought, which Whitehead had always said.</page><page sequence="15">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 631 ideal of intelligibility, he is constantly using notions which imply the opposite principle. Verbally, he denies consciousness to certain primordial entities, but actually his entire description of the history of their development (notably in Part III) is intelligible only if they are illicitly thought of as behaving in the way in which we be- have by virtue of our self-consciousness with its acknowledgment of value. In other words, he thinks one way and talks another. Or is that perhaps not the way to express it? Perhaps at one and the same time he is thinking in two entirely different ways. The consequences of all this are something which every reader must have felt-even if he has not put it into words-the half- hearted, but very puzzling, pan-psychism which pervades the en- tire treatment of Part III. I say puzzling pan-psychism, for that is what it really is. It puzzles us because on neither principle of intelligibility should it be pan-psychistic. If he works with the scientific, impersonal norm of intelligibility, the mental is not nec- essary for such intelligibility. If on the other hand he works with the conception that all intelligibility is ultimately "aim at value," an impersonal pan-psychism is insufficient. I have called it half- hearted, as well as puzzling. Perhaps, however, that is a misnomer. Some of Whitehead's interpreters, such as Professor Hartshorne, make it frankly and thoroughly pan-psychistic. And yet I can not help feeling that it is half-hearted, and for precisely the reasons that it is puzzling. Dare we perhaps say that Whitehead is him- self puzzled? That he himself feels the antagonism of these two principles of intelligibility? I rather think that this is so. C. The Notions of "Feeling" and "Value" The source of the unintelligibility in Whitehead's use of the no- tion of the mental we seem, then, to find in a fundamental ambiguity arising out of two incompatible ideals or norms of intelligibility. This is also the hidden source of the author's puzzling use of the notions of "feeling" and "valuation" which add so greatly to the merely linguistic unintelligibility of the book. To use them at all, on his premises, he must redesign them and in doing so he must redesign them out of all recognition. We have already seen the result of this redesigning in the case of feeling. Let us see what happens in the case of value. First of all it must be realized that the category of conceptual valuation, as he calls it, is put among the fundamental categories. In characterizing it, he says, "from each physical feeling (which as we have seen is a fundamental aspect of all existence) there is the derivation of a purely conceptual feeling whose datum is the external object, determinate of the definites of the actual or the</page><page sequence="16">632 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY nexus physically felt" (p. 40). I confess I do not know what this means, but that may easily be due to my own lack of intelli- gence and imagination. In any case, it is certainly at least quite clear that the notions of value and valuation have also been re- designed out of all recognition. Now I would not be misunder- stood here. If a writer wishes to extend such terms as value and valuation to every actual entity, he is in a sense free to do so. I am simply arguing that the terms do not mean the same thing in the two cases-and still more that, if he elects so to do, he must expect both linguistic and philosophical unintelligibility. Whitehead seems himself to feel the difficulties here. "Phi- losophers," he tells us, "can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles" (namely, the experience categories which he assigns to all the occasions in nature). "Weakness of in- sight and deficiencies of language stand in the way inexorably. Words and phrases must be stretched towards a generality foreign to their ordinary usage; and however such elements of language be stabilized as technicalities, they remain metaphors mutely appealing for an imaginative leap. " 6 Now I should not question this in prin- ciple, I should simply be disposed to ask whether we may not be asked to make too much of an imaginative leap. At still another point I would not be misunderstood. That which underlies his use of the category of valuation in this way is some- thing I can fully understand and as fully sympathize with. Value, for Whitehead, is an ultimate category, inseparable from existence and reality. In another context he has said words to this effect: if you are to get value into the world at all it must be at the begin- ning. With this I am in complete agreement. My only question is, how, on his premises, he can get it into the world at the beginning. Again, in The Concept of Natutre, he tells us that "the homogeneity of thought about nature excludes any reference to values, but that these values of nature are the clue to metaphysical synthesis." All this I, too, profoundly believe. We owe Professor Whitehead much that he has seen this fact and attempted this synthesis. We can only regret that the premises of his thinking, with their conflicting norms of intelligibility, seem to make this synthesis impossible.7 6 Process and Reality, p. 6. 7 If, as has been reported to me in private conversation, Whitehead has said that he views it as his "main task to overcome the isolation between natural science and value experiences," then we may say without hesitation that, if that task is not completely accomplished, he, more than any other thinker of the present time, has helped to show us the way. This criticism of the premises of his solution affects in no wise either my admiration for his grasp of the philosophical problem, nor my recognition of the important contributions he has made towards its solution.</page><page sequence="17">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 633 In sum, just as Whitehead constantly speaks two languages, so he also constantly works with two ideals of intelligibility, and, as I have indicated, these two facts are closely connected. I shall state the nature of this connection in the following way. If the fundamental principle of intelligibility is the primacy of value, if all ultimate reasons are always in terms of "aim at value," then we shall necessarily use one type of language, namely, anthro- pomorphic, or as I prefer to say, dramatic. Such a language will always be a subject-predicate language. There will be things and these things will have characters and predicates and perform ac- tions. If, on the other hand, the fundamental principle of intelligi- bility is that of functional relations, all language and expression will strive towards the ideal of mathematics. There will be no "things" and no having of predicates or doing of actions. Now I would not deny for a moment that both "languages" are necessary in human culture and, indeed, complementary, as Lloyd Morgan maintains.8 What I am disposed to insist upon is that, in any consistent and in- telligible philosophy, one of these ideals and types of expression must be made primary-that is, given a privileged position. Meta- physically, they are not equally ultimate and significant. Science, in its analytical aspect, strives towards a symbolism of relations (although on its cosmological side, it strives towards a symbolism of things and its language is dramatic), but metaphysics, whether realistic or idealistic, strives towards a symbolism of things and its language must be dramatic. The point that I am making will be- come fully clear, I think, when we turn to Whitehead's cosmology in which these two principles of intelligibility struggle for su- premacy. VI A. Intelligibility and Cosmology I come now to what seems to me to be the final and crucial prob- lem in connection with Process and Reality, namely, the intelligibil- ity of the world-process as a whole, as Whitehead presents it to us. "Constitutions," said Carlyle, "must be made to march." It may be said of philosophical systems also that they must be made to march. Does Process and Reality march? Does it "go"? First let me make clear what I mean by these questions. Any philosophy must move or march in the sense that its thought must move logically and intelligibly from point to point-even static systems like Spinoza's. But with dynamic systems-modern evo- 8 0.

Alexander, "Drama as a Cosmic Category," Philosophical Review, Vol. XXXIX (1930), pp. 105-126.</page><page sequence="18">634 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lutionary philosophies of whatever kind-whether idealistic or nat- uralistic, there must be process in the sense that we see reality un- rolling before us. This obligation Professor Whitehead recognizes. "The theme of Cosmology," he writes (p. 529), "which is the basis of all religions, is the story of the dynamic effort of the world, pass- ing into everlasting unity, and of the static majesty of God's vision accomplishinig its purpose of completion by absorption of the world's multiplicity of effort." This theme is developed in the latter part of the book. In admitting the theme of cosmology into his philosophy, and the obligation which such an admission entails, he has in the very state- ment of it acknowledged something further. In the first place it is a "story"; in other words, the language in which any cosmology is told must be a dramatic language. Indeed no other language is possible. Even in science whenever we pass from analysis to propo- sitions about the "universe" or physical cosmos, the language is no longer mathematical but dramatic. The universe is "building up" or "running down," etc. This is, of course, a fortiori true when we come to the cosmos of metaphysics. Whereas science may strive towards a symbolism of relations, metaphysics must, as Bergson says, strive towards a symbolism of things. The "story" is, as every one knows, told at great length in the latter part of Process and Reality. Whitehead's cosmology (which for one enthusiastic reviewer is to displace all philosophies of the past) is the story of the universe as it passes, so to speak, through four phases, beginning and ending in God. The first phase is an ultimate creativity in which God is primordial, non-temporal, and non-conscious. This phase contains what one might call a divine appetite for actuality which results in the diversified world of stars, earth, atoms, electrons, personalities, etc.-briefly in all the phe- nomena of human consciousness as well as of the theory of relativity and the quantum theory. But this is not enough. The hunger of deity passes into a third stage-"of perfected actuality, in which the many are one everlastingly, without the qualification of any loss either of individual identity or of completeness of unity." In the fourth phase the creative action completes itself. For the per- fected actuality passes back into the temporal world and qualifies this world so that each temporal actuality includes in it an immedi- ate fact of relevant experience. For the kingdom of heaven is with us today. The action of the fourth phase is the love of God for the world. These phases coexist as it were and interpenetrate. God as a being is unconscious as an end is conscious. The world of in- dividuals embraced by him hangs between him in his primordial and his completed phases.</page><page sequence="19">WHITEHEAD 'S METAPHYSICS 635 Here again, at the risk of again displaying my incompetence, I must confess to an extraordinary sense of bewilderment. I acknowl- edge and admire this magnificent attempt at adequacy, but I can not escape the sense of an equally magnificent obscurity. But that is not the point which I wish to make here. The point is rather that for me this cosmology does not march; if it appears to march at all, it is only by using the type of language which Whitehead has previously deprecated, only by bringing in illicitly notions belonging to traditional philosophy and cosmology. The Whitehead cosmology bears a superficial resemblance to certain great historic systems-such as those of Plotinus and Hegel. And, indeed, Whitehead has himself said in his Preface, "if this cosmology be deemed successful, it becomes natural to ask at this point whether the types of thought involved be not a transformation of some main features of Absolute Idealism on to a realistic basis." And we are allowed to infer that it is. But if it is successful-if the system does appear to march-it is only because it does contain some of the main features of historic idealism-namely, its ideal of intelligibility and the dramatic language and categories which alone can make such a story meaningful. It is, in fact, just the at- tempt to transfer it on to a realistic basis that creates the element of unintelligibility. Here again a basal confusion of categories is evi- dent. The term "realism," like its opposite, idealism, is, of course, a highly ambiguous word, but I think we can understand what it means here. It means-and can only mean-the primacy of the impersonal non-value categories in any categorial scheme, just as idealism means the primacy of the value and personal categories in the categorial scheme. Thus we can understand perfectly the real- istic nature of S. Alexander's scheme which makes space-time pri- mary and the other categories, including God, secondary. No less realistic in this sense is a theory, such as that of Whitehead, which makes "events" primary (even though space and spatialized time are conceived of as secondary). Certainly the main features of historic idealism can not be grafted on such a realism as that of Alexander. I do not think that they can be grafted on Whitehead's either. Of Alexander's construction it has been justly said that he got out of space-time what he did only by packing it with mean- ings which, as mere space-time, it does not properly have. For either we interpret it as something in which there is direction, or else we endow it with a nisus, potentiality, whether we use the terms or not. But this immediately transforms it into something quite other than the becoming (or space-time) of either common sense or</page><page sequence="20">636 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY science. I can not see that the situation is in principle any different in the case of the "realism" of the philosophy of events. B. Whitehead and Religion Process and Reality is made to march, it will be observed, largely by bringing God into the story. Now I do not object to his thus bringing God into the story. "The march of God in the world," of which Hegel spoke, is probably the only way of making history intelligible, of making it anything but "sound and fury signifying nothing." Similarly, the march of God in the cosmos is probably the only way of making the cosmos really intelligible. No, I do not object to bringing God in. I object greatly to the way in which He is brought in. What I mean is this. If one holds what I have called the tra- ditional conception of philosophic intelligibility-that space-time processes are not intelligible per se, that mind, self, values, are the key to intelligibility, then he can bring the notion of God in, both as efficient and final cause-as Aristotle did. But if he does not, then the only way to bring Him in is as Alexander has done-at the end of the process. If we are realists, in the sense of making pri- mary and ultimate space-time or, indeed, "events," as in White- head's system, then an emergent evolution which makes God the outcome of the process is at least conceptually understandable, even if not very intelligible intrinsically. But Whitehead attempts to bring Him in both ways, to the utter confusion, so it seems to me, of both himself and us. In any case, the idea of God has been so redesigned as to be beyond recognition. Professor Lovejoy recognizes that Whitehead's notion of God would have "horrified" all the masters of traditional philosophy, not merely the theists, but Plotinus, Bruno, and Spinoza, because the name is given not to the infinite fecundity, the fullness of being, but to the "principle of limitation." 9 It would have even horri- fied Kant, for whom the omnitudo realitatis and God were one. Now it is not a question of being horrified, although Whitehead's identi- fication of God's existence with the "ultimate irrationality" does invite a certain kind of horror; it is a question of redesigning the notion of God out of all recognition, and the essential unintelligibil- ity of the discourse about God that inevitably follows. I am ready to agree with Professor Lovejoy that the traditional notion has never been made wholly intelligible. Indeed, I am disposed to doubt, with 9 A. 0. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being, p. 333.</page><page sequence="21">WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 637 Balfour, that it ever can be. But, surely, it has not the intrinsic unintelligibility of Whitehead's notion. VII Man is so made that he can not help trying to understand the universe in which he lives. Science begins when he wonders about some particular object and tries to see how it fits into its surround- ings of space-time. Science passes into philosophy when the in- quirer goes on to ask for a meaning in the universe he is studying. Unless "how did it happen" passes over into "why did it happen" we get nowhere, we stultify all our previous inquiry. The only con- ceivable end to this process is the discovery of reality as self-au- thenticating, as that which we acknowledge as significant and mean- ingful-in short what I have called intrinsic intelligibility. Now Whitehead understands this. He feels both the necessity of speculative philosophy and also the need of self-authenticating intelligibility or rationality. For his insistence upon this, present- day philosophy owes him a debt of gratitude. As a historic force, working against the antimetaphysical and positivistic tendencies of our time his contribution is of incalculable value. As a doughty defender of the traditional principle of philosophical intelligibility -that all ultimate reasons are in terms of aim at value-he is at present one of the chief forces in keeping alive the more significant insights of traditional idealism. The difficulty is that, starting from his premises, no such intelligibility is possible; and, even if it were, granting his views of language, "it can not be expressed." Witt- genstein has, I feel, drawn the only legitimate conclusions from this view of language, but Whitehead would, of course, not accept them. I can not, therefore, help feeling that Process and Reality is a magnificent attempt to expound the unintelligible and to express the inexpressible. I would be the last person to deny either the mag- nificence of the attempt or the magnanimity of mind that motivated it. If I have been compelled to register my sense of its failure at certain crucial points, it is not only with the profoundest regret, but also with a full sense of the fact that we can learn infinitely more from the inadequacies and even obscurities of a great mind, than from the trivial exactitudes and specious lucidities of smaller men.
