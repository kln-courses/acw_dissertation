<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEWS Salisbury, London, West Bretton Recent public sculpture It is an accepted truth that contemporary sculpture tends to be more dependent on its context than that of any previous period. In the case of Mark Wallinger's Ecce Homo (Fig.61) context is all. One's initial response on seeing the first of the three sculptures to occupy the long-vacant plinth in the north-west corner of Trafalgar Square, London, is how tiny it seems.' Lacking any patination, far smaller than anything else in the square, it appears at first like some stray element from a plastic construction kit. But the realisation that this figure of Christ is life size, makes the sheer bombast of the traditional sculptures nearby cruelly apparent. The installation is deliberately theatrical: wearing a crown of thorns, Christ stands near naked on the front edge of the plinth, hands tied behind his back, as if being presented to the crowd prior to cruci- fixion; but the sculpture itself is un-rhetori- cal. This is crucial: if it were to be transposed to a gallery, it would seem unduly undemon- strative, even pedestrian, and its material- marbleised resin - commonplace. But its very ordinariness, when surrounded by the overblown monuments in Trafalgar Square, becomes a virtue and gives it a pathos without sentimentality, and with its implicit criticism of the 'heroic' sculptures around it, it raises the issue of Christ's sacrifice as an act of heroism. If Wallinger's Ecce Homo is wonderfully successful, it also serves to emphasise how important the consideration of context is in the planning of public sculpture. The Shape of the Century, seen first at Salisbury and later at Canary Wharf, London, was fascinating in showing the advantages and pitfalls of installing sculp- ture in first a cathedral and secondly a 60.

A major problem was that, sadly, the standard of carved sculptures by younger practitioners in the last twenty years has not been high. Most of the 'big names' of British sculpture were there, Richard Deacon being a notable absentee. Although it purported to show the whole of the twentieth century, the repre- sentation of the early decades was no more than token - some portrait heads by Epstein and a maquette by Eric Gill; but as the display was scattered rather than chrono- logical this was not a problem. The real issue was how far recent sculpture could enhance our experience of the cathedral (or, in the subsequent showing, ameliorate that of a clinical commercial environment) and vice versa. There were only two site-specific works, Nigel Hall's The here, the now (Fig.63), a spike of fifteen metres, hanging below the cathedral spire, that served to counterpoint the verticality of the building, andJonathan Garrat's Tree of gongs, a dozen or so large terracotta discs that hung from the trees of Sarum College garden in the close. In an exhibition where so much was earthbound, it added a welcome note of movement, catching the light in the breeze. Another successful sculpture was Richard Long's Spring ellipse (Fig.60), a large work of slate blocks spread out on the grass of the close, nestling like a shadow below the spire. Re- installed outside Norman Foster's new tube station at Canary Wharf, it held its space because of its formal simplicity, though lacking the lyricism of its original partner- ship with the cathedral. Inside the cathedral itself, the relatively simple forms and pronounced colours of several abstract works such as those by Anthony Caro and Shirazeh Houshiary, worked well. Most of the figurative sculp- ture was, however, excruciating: jokey, sentimental or plain vulgar. An honourable exception was Nicola Hicks's Sorry, sorry, Sarajevo (Fig.62) installed at the entrance to the Lady Chapel at Salisbury, where the directness of the pose - a man holding another injured man - and the avowedly modernist surface, cast from straw and mud, saved it from potential mawkishness. As part of Salisbury's annual festival, the remit of the exhibition was to introduce modern sculpture to a wider audience: this it seems to have done. (The most flagrant crowd pleaser was Antony Gormley's famil- iar Field, a sea of small terracotta figures, dramatically lit, which filled one side of the cloisters.) But the presence of work by a younger generation of more conceptual or installation-oriented artists might well have given a better indication of future possibili- ties for art in the cathedral setting. There is at least one similarity in the two sites, Salisbury having the tallest spire in England and Canary Wharf being the tallest skyscraper; but whereas, for all its size, the cathedral seems based on the human measure, the office foyers, plazas and retail corridors of Canary Wharf are not. In contrast to Salisbury, these are inde- terminate spaces, to be rushed through en route to somewhere else, progress through them having no potential metaphoric con- tent as it inevitably does in Salisbury. In Auge's term they are 'non-spaces', and most of the sculptures struggled to establish a place within them. Few of the works looked as comfortable or as good at Canary Wharf as at Salisbury, those located in the retail areas being especially uncomfortable - none more so than Nicola Hicks's, placed between two cafes. Many of the sculptures require a degree of intimacy that busy corri- dors and entrance halls could not provide: 62. Sory, sory, Sarajevo, by Nicola Hicks. (Exh.

David Nash's amiable monolith in oak, Mizunara bowl (Fig.64), whose avowed calm- ness and attention to the labour of the hand seemed very much at home in the cloisters, was a loser in this respect, especially with a rope barrier set around it; and Anthony Caro's Capital was dwarfed in the foyer of One Canada Square, an ironic result since Caro himself pointed out, many years ago, that no-one had yet devised a sculpture to sit below a skyscraper. An exception was Antony Gormley who, once again, showed his propensity for the theatrical by instal- ling a single recumbent iron figure in a still unoccupied shopping area so that it appeared to float in the empty, morgue-like space. Keith Rand's Originalform, a column of warped and twisted oak panels sited on the edge of the old docks outside the devel- opment, also contrasted well with the tower. Symptomatically, both these artists have provided different sculptures from those 64. Mizunara bowl, by David Nash. Oak (exh. Salisbury Cathedral). they had installed at Salisbury. As many of these works inadvertently demonstrated, the modern office foyer has the ability to reduce sculptures to executive toys, cultural signifiers of prestige and decor but having no meaning. In recent years, this has often seemed to be the case with the work of the American artist, Joel Shapiro, whose large anthropomorphic sculptures, cast in bronze from blocks of wood, have become an ubiquitous essential of the Amer- ican foyer. It was heartening, therefore, to see a survey of his work at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park at West Bretton near Wakefield;3 and further sculptures by him at the New Art Centre, Roche Court near Salisbury (closed 31st August). Both shows demonstrated Shapiro's rich formal devel- opment from the earlier, small house shapes to the large 'figures' and more complex sculptures of recent years. In these two land- scape settings his works seemed stranger and more intriguing as geometries than they do in any office environment.

Brussels James Ensor Although James Ensor cultivated his image as a misunderstood outsider, he has long been established as the central figure of Belgian modernism. During his lifetime he was showered with official honours, and this ambitious exhibition at the Musees royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels (to 13th February), commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of his death, is yet another testament to the privileged position he occupies in his native land. Two hundred of Ensor's paintings are currently displayed in Brussels, alongside some one hundred and fifty works on paper and countless documents, letters and photographs which throw new light on his creative methods. Although this is the most exhaustive retro- spective of Ensor's work to date, the painting that did most to establish his international 65. Skeletons trying to warm themselves, by James Ensor. 1889. 75 by 60 cm. (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth; exh. Musees royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels). compositions such as the Kimbell Muse- um's Skeletons trying to warm themselves of 1889 (Fig.65) and exquisitely delicate still lifes and seascapes dating from the 1890s, hang side by side with many a flat and empty painting in this enormous show. As he advanced in years Ensor began to parody his earlier style and the brilliant subversiveness of his paint- ing deteriorated into decorative repetition. The exhibition would have benefited from stricter editing throughout, but a token representation would have sufficed in the rooms devoted to the last fifty years of the artist's life. Ensor's best work (like that of several major modernist artists, including de Chirico, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Christian Schad), enjoyed a brief flowering followed by a long decline, and there is no doubt that his reputation would be better served by a more selective exhibition devot- ed to his early years. Ensor's imagination and ambition were sparked by the brilliant constellation of circumstances he encountered in Brussels 66. Scandalised masks, by James Ensor. 1883. 135 by 112 cm.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and appears in the city that inspired its creation only in the ghostly disguise of a large illuminated transparency. To some extent this major disappoint- ment is compensated for by the presence of numerous lesser-known masterpieces. Ensor was a famously contradictory and in- consistent character: wonderfully inventive 765</page></plain_text>
