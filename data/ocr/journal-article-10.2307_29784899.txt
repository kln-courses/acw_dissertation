<plain_text><page sequence="1">Blarsted Dirt, Bloomin' Farm, Mysterious Darkness: The Presence and Rhythm of Rural Nature in O'Neill's Early Plays Robert Baker-White Williams College In the summer of 1934, the forty-six-year-old O 'Neill upbraided his friends George Jean Nathan and Sean O'Casey for their supposed love of city life. In language that foreshadowed his deathbed renunciation of hotel rooms, the playwright fumed: You talk of the thrill of cities, as against the so-called loneliness and stagnation of the country. What is the thrill? A lot of meaningless noise, a lot of crowding bores, a lot of awful smells, a swirl of excited nothingness! You talk of the thrill of a city's beauty. Well [pointing out the window], look at those skyscrapers! What are they, what do they stand for? Nothing but a lot of children's blocks. Do you mean to say that they've got anything to do with the great soul of humanity, with humanity's deep underlying essence, and hopes, and fate? You're both bughouse!" (Sheaffer, Son and Artist438) With this exclamation, O'Neill seems to voice a preference for "the country," and even to suggest by a kind of inverse inference that "humanity's deep underlying essence" is perhaps more readily found outside of urban centers,</page><page sequence="2">Robert Baker-White 49 away from the crowding bores and excited nothingness. As I will show from consideration of several early works, the young O'Neill's representations of country life and its effect on his characters were far more ambiguous than this mid-life tirade may suggest. In fact, his relation to rural existence turns out to be just as conflicted, and just as evocative of internal tensions and divisions, as his far more studied relation to maritime environments. We can acknowledge an accepted wisdom in O'Neill scholarship that posits a psychological and even perhaps ontological split between land and sea from the earliest work to the final tragic masterpieces, but at the same time recognize a division between types of representation of the land itself that has, at times, equal force in the dramaturgy. One way to frame O'Neill's dichotomous treatment of rural nature is to invoke Leo Marx's commentary on Samuel Clemens's two types of Mississippi river travelers?on the one hand tourists who, "schooled in romantic landscape painting," view the play of light on the river as a "misted, beautiful picture," and on the other hand the riverboat pilots who by contrast "must probe the real meaning of the silver streak: is it a 'break' from a new snag that might destroy a steamboat?" (324). As Marx comments, this "pilot's dilemma" appears as a regular and distinctive feature of American fiction. [Clemens] [...] longs to convey a joyous, even reverent feeling for the landscape of the Mississippi Valley as he had known it in his youth. Yet neither of the available modes?the passengers' or the pilot's?will serve his purpose. What is more, the two ways of apprehending the river represent opposed sets of values. One is identified with the passengers and the uninitiated, novice pilot, the other with the older, wiser narrator, Mark Twain. There are many differences between these two points of view, but the most important is the relation to nature each implies. The passengers are strangers to the river. They lack the exact, technical knowledge possessed by the trained pilot. Yet as spectators, schooled in romantic landscape painting, they know what to look for. [. . .] Their aesthetic response, given the American geography, Clemens associates with the effete, cultivated, urban, privileged East. The pilot, on the other hand, is of the West, and in his calling he can scarcely afford to admire the break in the shadow that shines like silver. [...] To do his job the pilot must keep his mind upon the menacing "reality" masked by the beautiful river. (323-24) Marx goes on to note that "[l]ike Melville's Ishmael, Clemens's narrator is confronted with an impossible choice between two modes of perception: one is aesthetically and emotionally satisfying, yet illusive; the other is analytically and practically effective, copes with harsh realities, yet is devoid of all but</page><page sequence="3">50 The Eugene O'Neill Review utilitarian value and meaning" (Marx 324). The pilot's dilemma illustrates the distinction between what Marx calls sentimental and complex pastoralism. Put most simply, sentimental pastoralism invokes nature as a "symbolic repository of meaning and value," whereas complex pastoralism "acknowledges the reality of history" (363). The examples from early plays examined here will show O'Neill as a developing playwright who is aware of the distinction; the more complicated the dramas become (including many of those from later in his career not treated here) the more his employment of this tension within single plays works to propel their emotional and ideational dramatic action. Drama in the West is, historically, an urban phenomenon. There have been important exceptions to this fact through the years, but by and large the most enduring of our dramatic literatures and the most significant theatrical innovations of the Western tradition have flowered in the beds of the cities? Athens, Rome, London, Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, and New York. In the American context, the nexus of urbanity and theatricality is curious, however, precisely because Americans have so often defined themselves and their national character with reference to the open spaces and unexplored terrain of the North American continent. Thus city theater audiences inevitably rely on represented versions of their environmental homeland. In the years preceding O'Neill's arrival on the national stage, melodrama often provided the clearest examples of this drive toward ecological definition. A prime example is William Vaughn Moody's nineteenth-century classic The Great Divide. The Great Divide is representative of the ecological focus of American melodrama in several ways. The play's fictional locales, scenic effects, and characters' descriptions of the natural world reveal a type of environmental emplacement that effects how the audience understands the basic world of the play. Beyond this, central elements of the plot itself rest on specific natural referents (the desert, a mountain mine, etc.) with which characters' lives are inextricably bound. But The Great Divide is exemplary in a more profound sense as well, as the fundamental ideational force of the melodrama proceeds from concepts as ecological/environmental as they are philosophical or ideological. The play is a play of ideas that revolves around questions of what constitutes "natural" life in several registers of thought. O'Neill, of course, would have been familiar with Moody's play, and we can look to The Great Divide as a template for the type of ecological referentiality that the young playwright will later deploy and expand with increasing sophistication in his own works. The melodramas of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries do not wear well theatrically in the present age, due primarily to the heightened emotionalism that informs character motivation and the improbability of plotted events. Yet the plays nonetheless often did very serious work in unpacking</page><page sequence="4">Robert Baker-White 51 important societal concerns for eager audiences who did not, after all, have the luxury of nightly news or other forms of mass cultural commentary. In the case of The Great Divide, Moody creates a drama that focuses on issues of gender, class, and the conflicting prerogatives of a traditional society and individual, entrepreneurial initiative. The first act finds Ruth Jordan living with her brother Phil on a ranch in the southwestern desert, attempting to make a living harvesting "cactus fiber." When Ruth spends a night alone in the small house, three men force their way inside. Bargaining with one of them, Stephen Ghent, Ruth promises to marry him if he will protect her from the other two men. This he does by buying them off. Ghent then takes Ruth off to a home on the edge of a steep canyon in the Cordillera Mountains, where he gains great wealth as the owner of a prosperous mine. Ruth lives bitterly with Ghent, never letting him forget that their marriage was born of a criminal and brutal bargain (she constantly reminds him that she had been "bought"), despite his efforts to prove a sincere attachment to her. She is eventually found by her brother, who convinces her to return east to Massachusetts, where she bears her and Ghent's first child. Ghent surreptitiously follows her there, eventually making contact with her family. The Jordan's "old money" is nearly gone, partly due to Phil's misadventure in the desert, and Ghent, without Ruth's knowledge, uses his income from the mine to shore up the family's finances. In a climactic final act, Ghent confronts Ruth in her mother's living room, convincing her finally to chose his vision of a free life in the west over her tradition-bound existence on the eastern seaboard. Ghent also buys back, and restores to Phil, the previously abandoned desert cactus-fiber operation, which now has become a successful business. As could be expected from the basics of plot, imagery of the natural world abounds in Moody's play, which, as with many dramatic entertainments from the period, served partly as a kind of vicarious travelogue for eastern audiences desirous of encountering the exotic west. The initial description of the view from Philip Jordan's cabin is of a desert "intensely colored, and covered with the uncouth shapes of giant cacti, dotted with bunches of gorgeous bloom" (3). Place and animal names?the Goodwater trail, a rail junction at Cottonwood Wash, a horse called Buckskin?seem fit for parody from our perspective, but they do evince Moody's attempt to create a theatricalized west full of life, color, and to a significant degree, danger as well. From the perspective of what the play posits as a thoroughly "civilized," eastern position, the land itself is a kind of work in progress. Speaking with her sister-in-law prior to the pivotal events of the first act, Ruth Jordan describes the man of her dreams as someone not "rounded off, a complete product" but rather "a sublime abstraction?of the glorious unfulfilled?of the West?the Desert" (16). Personified here as an object of female lust, the ecosystem itself is thrown into the vortex of competing</page><page sequence="5">52 The Eugene O'Neill Review desires that The Great Divide activates in its portrayal of turn-of-the-century American attitudes. The animated wilderness pervades Ruth's imagination and underscores the extent to which Moody's play relentlessly draws the non-human into the human sphere, evincing Marx's vision of sentimental pastoralism quite convincingly. Alone in the desert cabin, Ruth speaks to wildflowers ("Be still, you beauties! You'll drive me to distraction with your color and your odor"), and she comments to herself on "what a scandal the moon is making out there in that great crazy world" (26). While Ruth clearly forges a connection to her natural surroundings, she also evinces unease ("distraction . . . scandal") in the relationship. Later, when describing the mountain setting in the Cordilleras (act 2), the focus is less on the apparent gap between humanity and environment, and more on how Ghent's western identity puts him "at home" in the landscape. His adobe cabin is "mellowed to ivory by sun and dust," and the rude materials of the natural rock terrace have "manifestly been touched by a refined and artistic hand, bent on making the most of the glorious natural background" (53). Beyond this use of language, Moody also manipulates stagecraft to emphasize the mountain setting by having characters come into view of the audience as actors simulate a climb up onto the playing area from over the edge of the steep canyon wall. Moody engages in a bit of metatheatrical irony also in act 2, after Ruth's brother and sister-in-law have discovered her new mountain home. Polly, Phil's wife, remarks that by moving to this exotic locale, Ruth has done a "really theatrical thing [...] And what a setting! My dear, your stage arrangements are perfect" (87). Irony aside, what this dialogue prefigures is the manner in which Moody will eventually enfold the characters' own sense of ecological awareness with the drama's underlying philosophical argument. As we will see, it is precisely this type of ecological self-awareness that O'Neill will adopt and develop further in his own works. Ruth begins to voice the linkage between environment and personal subjectivity when she exclaims to Ghent that "[a]s you rode before me down the arroyos, and up over the mesas, through the dazzling sunlight and the majestic silence, it seemed as if you were leading me out of a world of little codes and customs into a great new world" (108). The "little codes and customs" come more and more to be associated squarely with the puritan ethos of Ruth's New England home (Ruth's mother states plainly, "O, that dreadful West! If my children had only stayed where they were born and bred" [122]), while Ghent's free and unburdened sense of self is likewise associated with the topographical and environmental essence of the mountainous West. In the climactic third act, Polly describes Ghent as a "volcano," calm enough until one gets "a glimpse down one of the old volcanic rifts in his surface, and see[s]?far below?underneath the cold lava-beds?</page><page sequence="6">Robert Baker-White 53 fire, fire, the molten heart of a continent!" (139). Such bombastic imagery is outdone by Ghent himself, however, in the penultimate moments of the play. In one of the most emblematic melodramatic outbursts of the period, Moody's hero proclaims I know what you're saying there to yourself, and I guess you're right. Wrong is wrong, from the moment it happens till the crack of doom, and all the angels in Heaven, working overtime, can't make it less or different by a hair. That seems to be the law. I've learned it hard, but I guess I've learned it. I've seen it written in mountain letters across the continent of this life. ?Done is done, and lost is lost, and smashed to hell is smashed to hell. We fuss and potter and patch up. You might as well try to batter down the Rocky Mountains with a rabbit's heart-beat! He goes to the door, where he turns. You've fought hard for me, God bless you for it.?But it's been a losing game with you from the first!?You belong here, and I belong out yonder?beyond the Rockies, beyond?the Great Divide! (164) Martin Halpern has commented that the association of these characters with natural referents has the effect of "identifying those protagonists with the entire land they inhabit" (131). Extrapolating from this idea we can imagine The Great Divide as a kind of animation of the American landscape itself, through the agency of Moody's ethical characters. Halpern describes the central philosophical dichotomy that the play metaphorizes?"nature over civilization, freedom over law, the present over the past"?and comments that Moody is "concerned not with widening the 'Great Divide' between East and West but with closing it" (130). One aspect of closing that divide surely involves a merging of sentimental and complex pastoralism exemplified in Ghent's ability to turn a profit from the desert land while simultaneously wooing Ruth with rapturous descriptions of his beloved Rockies. Moody's play is a useful point of embarkation for considering O'Neill's representation of rural locales because it frames quite succinctly the manner in which associations with ecological referents can shape an audience's perception of character and action, and also how such association can, within the drama, shape perceptions between and among characters themselves. In the early O'Neill plays I examine here, leading up to the breakthrough success of Beyond the Horizon, we can see this shaping of perception at work in a variety of registers. In American Drama: The BastardAnf Susan Smith argues against the time honored tradition of finding authentic American identity in the land, and in what she calls the "autochthonic paradigm" of American letters.1 As Smith notes, the land itself exists in American writing as "an inescapable thematic concern," and in the development of American literature, the "insistence on</page><page sequence="7">54 The Eugene O'Neill Review the formative force of the land was part of the culture as a whole" (109). As a result of this geographic determinism, Smith argues, "one factor in determining the essential 'Americanness' of American literature was a close connection to the land, which did not escape the notice of those struggling to create an acceptable American drama" (109). In place of this historical drive to authenticate national literature by virtue of its attention to the earth, Smith suggests instead a "generic paradigm" for determining Americanness at least in the drama?a paradigm based on "the desire to perform, the desire to engage in dialogic practices onstage in public" (113). The impetus for such a transformation is clearly political?Smith argues that such a performative test would allow for an Americanness that is no longer the "exclusive property of westering white men" (Smith 113). Although it is far from my purpose here to dispute that much of what Smith describes as the American drama's propensity to define its value around precisely that nexus of established, landed privilege, I will argue that simply to ignore what Una Chaudhuri calls the "geopathological" or what I call more simply the ecological imperative in American drama in favor of another paradigm will not suffice.2 And in the case of O'Neill, a certain crusty resistance to privilege, perhaps especially landed privilege, serves to complicate the autochthonic paradigm. For one thing, it is clear on first glance (and despite perhaps his outburst at Nathan and O'Casey) that O'Neill was not especially prone simplistically to romanticize rural life as necessarily more virtuous than its urban counterpart. As John Patrick Diggins notes, "in America's political culture the countryside had been seen as far removed from the corruptions of the city. [...] Jeffersonian ethos exalted the tillers of the soil as 'God's chosen people.' In O'Neill's plays, however, people in the country are given more to vice than virtue, usually greed, envy, spite, and lust" (173). The prime examples here are clearly the young Anna Christie, who must escape the corruption of a Minnesota farm to receive redemption on the seacoast, and the libidinally fated Cabot clan of Desire Under the Elms?both subjects beyond the scope of this study. Other characters' associations with inland landscapes are somewhat more conflicted, but none falls into a simple pattern of reverence for the bucolic life. As Diggins writes, "idolization of the farm never convinced O'Neill" (173). That O'Neill himself was never really content in the countryside is also relevant. In addition to his storied seaside homes on Cape Cod, Bermuda, Sea Island, and Marblehead, he also invested considerable money and personal energy in several inland homes. He purchased the bucolic Brook Farm in Ridgefield, Connecticut that would provide the template for signature fictional locales in later works. While traveling the world with Carlotta, he inhabited a rural chateau in France surrounded by woodlands and farm fields. And he and Carlotta eventually painstakingly constructed Tao House in the rolling hills</page><page sequence="8">Robert Baker-White 55 above Danville, California. But through all of these episodes, O'Neill was really never more at home in the country than he was in the despised cities. This very lack of comfort in any ecological niche?save, perhaps, for the bowsprit of a sailing ship?goes far toward explaining the disconnected and unrooted anxiety of many of O'Neill's principal characters. Early Plays That the young playwright would develop a penchant for overt landscape symbolism in his deployment of natural images can hardly be in doubt: in the largely unremarkable 1914 drama Bread and Butter, the would-be artist John Brown's room in act 4 is decorated with "two paintings in the Impressionist style, a landscape and seascape" (166).3 As Bogard later comments, these paintings are "emblems of what John has lost, Samson's locks in the Philistine tents" (37). O'Neill will not easily abandon such blatant symbolic scenic effects, but will over time learn to complicate their resonance and confound such easy identification of referents. As Bogard also comments, the juxtaposition of land and sea displayed in BreadandButter will become a much more full presence in Beyond the Horizon, where they will constitute "the poles of man's being, epitomizing the forces to which he belongs" (37). The impressionist hint in the earlier play is a foretaste of what will become a full menu of symbolic deployments of the land. American landscape in general, whether depicted in impressionist or more realist style, has always carried with it a sense of vagueness, not unlike the awe-inspiring yet generalized qualities of the maritime sublime exemplified in literature (Melville, Hemingway) and painting (James Buttersworth, Homer). As Yi-Fu Tuan has recognized, American space was historically associated with "a vast undefined hovering and haunting presence 'out there to the west,'" that actually correlates to a "certain cloudiness of vision about what the new nation wanted" (200). O'Neill in his very first plays taps into this vague westerly presence, usually with no more sophistication than William Vaughn Moody's bombastic melodrama provided. A Wife for a Life (1913) is a cliche-ridden sketch about two desert wanderers discussing the possibility of loving a woman that warrants no significant analysis (Bogard: "turn-of-the century theatre at its worst" [9]), yet the opening stage direction is revealing: " [. . .] a plain dotted in the foreground with clumps of sagebrush. On the horizon a lonely butte is outlined, black and sinister against the light darkness of a sky with stars" (3). That O'Neill should even care to include a detailed (if familiar and simplistic) western scene in this early vaudevillian sketch again demonstrates his desire to, or perhaps more precisely his seeming inability not to, situate his characters' moral and emotional dilemmas within settings of ecological specificity. Whether or not the feeble attempt at moralizing in A Wife</page><page sequence="9">56 The Eugene O'Neill Review for a Life is materially enhanced by the attention to natural referents is less important than the fact that even here, in his first published work, O'Neill, as if channeling Moody, makes the attempt and forges a correlation between, on the one hand, the characters' psychological barrenness and moral vacillation and, on the other, the kind of undefined and haunting western presence to which Tuan refers. Raymond Williams has noted that "a working country is hardly ever a landscape" (qtd. in Mitchell 3), and thus, as with Marx, he describes how a tension always exists between the physical environment worked by people, and a landscape as a form of represented (usually pacific and calming) meaning. That O'Neill could easily deploy that latter, romantic vision is clear from a short exchange in the 1915 drama The Personal Equation, when the young anarchists Tom and Olga discuss what they will do after implementing their plan to dynamite a ship: Tom tells Olga "[w]hen we get back we'll both take a trip into the country. I know a place?a farm in the Jersey hills?nice people?be glad to have us. We'll go there." She replies: "That would be wonderful. I feel as if I could lie for days in the cool grass, looking up at the sky?and dreaming" (357). This bucolic representation?a highly sentimental pastoral ideal? reappears in slightly later works as well, as when the playwright Michael Cape expounds on rural bliss in the 1923 marriage drama Welded "You can't imagine how wonderful it's been up in the country. There's just enough winter in the air to make one energetic. [...] Solitude and work. I was happy" (CP2 247). These examples demonstrate a kind of Edenic vision of the countryside that the young O'Neill seemingly could not resist. Williams has shown how the appeal to rural life that is "happy," pure, and seemingly always fading (no matter in which historical epoch one looked) is, of course, the appeal to Eden itself (12). There is, in this appeal to the ever-receding, Edenic rural values, a curious conflation of place and time. The rural experience, and in some instances the wilderness experience as well, although defined by an identification of place, is associated with a (lost) age as well. When we go out from the city, we go back in time. As Roy Porter succinctly puts it, "Country life was always idyllic about two generations ago" (179). This backward-looking appeal to uncomplicated rural peace will specifically reappear in later works by O'Neill, most notably throughout Ah, Wilderness!, and also in the somewhat curious form of Hugo Kalmar's repeated lyrical appeal to the bygone cool shade of willow trees in The Iceman Cometh. In other early works, O'Neill explored a more complex set of relations between character and natural environment through investigating the actual activity of humans on the land, where the setting becomes not simply landscape but Williams's "working country." Before we encounter a prime example of this dramaturgy in Beyond the Horizon's interweaving of conflicted and conflicting</page><page sequence="10">Robert Baker-White 57 ties to farmed land with characters' heightened desires and possibilities, we can see in early works such as The Long Voyage Home (1917) and The Rope (1918) that O'Neill's characters recognize explicitly how living in the country ultimately means working with the earth. In the former play, the seaman Cocky bitterly disparages his colleague Olson's desire to quit the sea for life on a farm: "Goin' back to 'ome an' mother. Goin' to buy a bloomin' farm an' punch the blarsted dirt, that's wot 'e is! (spitting disgustedly) There's a funny bird of a sailor man for yer, Gawd blimey" (513). And in the latter, young Luke violently lashes out at his brother-in-law Pat Sweeney's offer of half the family farm: "I don't want no truck with this rotten farm. You kin have my share of that. I ain't made to be no damn dirt puncher?not me! And I ain't goin' to loaf round here more'n I got to, and when I goes this time, I ain't never comin' back. Not me! Not to punch dirt and milk cows. You can have the rotten farm for all of me. What I wants is cash?regular coin yuh kin spend?not dirt" (567). The contrast between these angry denunciations of rural life and the Edenic visions cited earlier demonstrates a tension within O'Neill's oeuvre that correlates with Marx's polarity within American pastoral generally. One final early play that warrants consideration is the autobiographical drama The Straw, written in 1919 (actually one year after Beyond the Horizon). The protagonist is a young writer, Stephen Murray, undergoing treatment at a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients. The direct parallel with O'Neill's personal experience is obvious, as is the correlation between the fictional rural setting and the actual location of the Gaylord Farm Sanitarium in Wallingford, Connecticut that he entered on Christmas Eve in 1912. Stephen Murray's story of courtship, abandonment, and eventual reuniting with a fellow patient named Eileen Carmody is based on an actual relationship O'Neill had while at Gaylord Farm, but many of the details are entirely fictional as is the specific deployment of ecological referents within the text. O'Neill does not fail to emphasize that the treatment center is located "in the hills," and, in the stage direction opening the second act, he specifies the natural scene: "? the rear wall, a long series of French windows looking out on the lawn, with wooded hills in the far background. Shrubsin flowergrowimmediately outside the windows. Lnside, there is a row of potted plants (747). And to underscore the notion of the natural setting, Stephen Murray provides a tuberculosis patient's parody of The Rhubaiyat of Omar Khayam's famous phrases while speaking to one of the sanitarium nurses: "A glass of milk, and thou Coughing beside me in the wilderness? Ah?wilderness were Paradise enow!" (746).</page><page sequence="11">58 The Eugene O'Neill Review Besides the obvious foreshadowing of O'Neill's later treatment in Ah, Wilderness!, the mocking language calls specific attention to the paradisiacal quality of the rural tubercular treatment program. In this play, as in O'Neill's actual experience, an idealized yet very real environment literally plays a crucial role in the preservation of the protagonist's life. But it is in the way that O'Neill brings his characters out into the natural environment in the development of their relationship that marks The Strawas a particularly revealing work. In act 2, scene 2 Stephen and Eileen hold a clandestine midnight meeting at a crossroads near the sanitarium. The stage direction in full reads: The main road comes down forward from the right A smaller road, leading down from the left, joins it toward left, center. Dense woods rise sheer from the grass and bramble-grown ditches at the road's sides. At thejunction of the two roads there is a signpost, its arms pointing toward the right and the left, rear. A pile of round stones is at the road corner, left forward. A full moon, riding high overhead, throws the roads into white shadowless relief and masses the woods into walls of compact blackness. The trees lean heavily together, their branches motionless, unstirred by any trace of wind. [... Eileen is discovered here, standing in the middle of the road] Her face shows white and clear in the bright moonlight as she stares with anxious expectancy up the road to the left. Her body is fixed in an attitude of rigid immobility as if she were afraid the slightest movement would break the spell of silence and awaken the unknown. She has shrunk instinctively as faraway as she can from the mysterious darkness which rises at the roads sides like an imprisoning wall. (764) It will be only one year later that O'Neill completes work on his most renowned representation of a forest in The Emperor Jones(1920). But the menacing and even animistic quality of the woods in this description works in similar fashion to that famous depiction, and this concentration of natural imagery?a sharpening of mood that subtly influences characters' behavior within the dramatic moment?shows a growing control of the stage environment that now clearly surpasses Moody's melodramatic efforts at similar dramatic effect. Steven and Eileen are conditioned by the "compact blackness" and conspiratorial trees that lean together, unstirred. O'Neill here stretches his description to a kind of fullness that is meant to inspire in the designers and hence the actors and eventually the audience an awareness of how the agency of the setting influences the agents of the drama. The natural world fills the pauses in their dialogue, as they awkwardly grope toward acknowledging their mutual attraction: " There is an uncomfortable pause. Murray seems waiting</page><page sequence="12">Robert Baker-White 59 [sic] for her to speak. He looks about him at the trees, up into the moonlit sky, breathing in the fresh night air with a healthy delight. Eileen remains with downcast head, staring at the road' (766). In fact, in moments like these, there seem to be three agents present, rather than two. The animated natural world functions as character as much as setting in Stephen and Eileen's world. For the play's final act, set back inside the antiseptic environment of the sanitarium (" The walls and furniture are painted white. [...]# single iron bed painted white9) O'Neill does not neglect to give another description of the surrounding ecological milieu: The woods, the leaves of the trees rich in their autumn coloring, rise close about this side of the Infirmary. Their branches almost touch the porch on the right. In the rear of the porch they have been cleared away from the building for a narrow space, and through this opening the distant hills can be seen with the tree tops glowing in the sunlight. (773) The autumnal aura provides a clunky symbolic foreshadowing of Eileen's doubtful chances for survival. The woods are distant here, not the fearful and powerful presence they constituted earlier in the play. But the extent to which that external world defined the previous encounter is obvious from dialogue and stage directions. Murray, speaking to Eileen, prompts a painful memory of their previous meeting when he suggests, "We could take a walk, then? through the woods. (A wince of pain shadows Eileen 's face. She closes her eyes. Murray continues softly, after a pause?) You haven't forgotten that last night?out there?Eileen?" (784). In a fundamental way, "out there" in The Straw is hope and possibility, contrasted directly to the lifeless whiteness of the constructed interior. In this unsure and ultimately thin drama, O'Neill makes a move with the countryside not unlike the one he will make with the sea in "Annie Christie"', he casts nature as life itself. Beyond the Horizon O'Neill's first real theatrical success was the 1918 tragic drama Beyond the Horizon, which announced in large part his arrival in New York as a major American playwright. It is a family drama that charts the paths of two brothers (and the woman they both love) through a set of life choices that ultimately destroys bonds and crushes happiness. Crucially, the choices involve not just how to live, but where?; not just what values to embrace, but from what ecological environments do those values emanate? The story of Robert and Andrew Mayo is a story of oikosmd logos?of the family hearth and of how we imagine that actual and symbolic place in language and custom?an ecological tale whose tragic trajectory results from an inability to accommodate</page><page sequence="13">60 The Eugene O'Neill Review one to the other in sustainable fashion. The opening stage direction is long and detailed in its depiction of a New England rural scene: A section of country highway. The road runs diagonally from the left, forward, to the right, rear, and can be seen in the distance winding toward the horizon like a pale ribbon between the low, rolling hills with their freshly plowed fields clearly divided from each other, checkerboard fashion, by the lines of stone walls and rough snake fences. The forward triangle cut off by the road is a section of a field from the dark earth of which myriad bright-green blades of fall-sown rye are sprouting. A straggling line of piled rocks, too low to be called a wall, separates this field from the road. To the rear of the road is a ditch with a sloping, grassy bank on the far side. From the center of this an old, gnarled apple tree, just budding into leaf, strains its twisted branches heavenwards, black against the pallor of distance. A snake-fence sidles from left to right along the top of the bank, passing beneath the apple tree. The hushed twilight of a day in May isjust beginning. The horizon hills are still rimmed by a faint line of flame, and the sky above them glows with the crimson flush of the sunset. This fades gradually as the action of the scene progresses. (573) Unfortunately for O'Neill, the poetic aspirations contained within this scenic description were, by many accounts, woefully absent from the physical manifestation of the first production. Alexander Woollcott wrote of the "conspicuously dinky expanses of nature" present on the stage (qtd. in Wainscott 21) created primarily by means of painted drops "in the curiously inappropriate style of a German postcard" (qtd. in Bogard 118). Yet despite this historic scenic failure, from the perspective of time we can at least perceive O'Neill's strong desire to evoke particular ecological details that become crucial in establishing connections to this land for both characters and audience. The pale ribbon of horizon, the bright-green blades of fall-sown rye, the gnarled branches of the twisted apple tree straining heavenward?these details in O'Neill's scenic prose pull toward a sentimental pastoral vision within which the Mayo brothers live, and into which we are thrown at the rise of the curtain. The play's very first scene makes this pastoral vision?and two</page><page sequence="14">Robert Baker-White 61 counterparts, the Mayo farm as a place of work, and the lure of a vision beyond the farm?the subjects of extended dialogue between the brothers. Andrew's identity as a productive member of the agrarian human community is emphasized through his playful rejection of Robert's lofty dreaming. Scorning the poetry book Robert has been reading on the country fence, Andrew exclaims, "Imagine me reading poetry and plowing at the same time! The team'd run away, I bet" (574). Here in the drama's first moments O'Neill ignites the tensions between a poetic sensibility associated with the dark, fertile soil and a prosaic reality of actual rural work?Leo Marx's dialectic of pastoral in action. In fact the two boys are remarkably self-conscious of this distinction, and their dialogue reflects a relatively high level of self-understanding with regard to their notions of ecological situatedness. Andrew tells his younger brother: "Farming ain't in your nature ... you like the home part of it, I expect; but as a place to work and grow things, you hate it." Robert does not entirely disagree, replying to Andrew, "You're a Mayo through and through. You're wedded to the soil" (576). And Robert's rejection of that earthly matrimony is seconds later confirmed by his self-professed alternative desire: " [. . .] it's just Beauty that's calling me, the beauty of the far off and the unknown, the mystery and spell of the East which lures me in the books I've read, the need of the freedom of great wide spaces [. . .] beyond the horizon" (577). And so the three ideas by which the brothers will orient themselves throughout the drama?farm as idyll, farm as workplace, and horizon as freedom?are all introduced in the opening dialogue. Andrew's sardonic, dismissive response to Robert's idealistic outburst?"you can have all the sea you want by walking a mile down to the beach [...] there's plenty of horizon to look at [...]. As for the mystery and spell, I haven't met 'em yet, but they're probably lying around somewheres" (577)?hardly ends the debate. In fact it simply spurs Robert on to further horizon-gazing in preparation for his next pivotal encounter, which of course involves the subject of the two boys' mutual desire?Ruth Atkins. Robert's first-act dialogue with Ruth sets in motion key plot elements that will define the fates of each major character. It is here that he acknowledges his love for Ruth, and that this love can overwhelm his desire for travel and adventure on the "far-off sea." Ruth's pleading in ecological terms?"Please, Rob! We'll be so happy here together where it's natural and we know things" (583)?brings him around to his brother's view of the native soil. Robert admits "Perhaps after all Andy was right [...] when he said I could find all the things I was seeking for right here, at home on the farm" (583). But as later developments will prove, Robert's newly professed comfort with his home environment is on some level a diversion, a kind of sleight of hand that allows him to indulge his love of Ruth while imagining that it is an acceptance of the rural home as home. As the scene ends, Robert and Ruth allow the environmental</page><page sequence="15">62 The Eugene O'Neill Review referentiality of their romance to extend outwards to the sky, claiming the first star they see, as he bends to kiss her, as their star. The subsequent events all revolve around the distinctions and desires introduced in these initial encounters. Robert's announcement that he will stay on the land with Ruth, rather than traveling the sea with his uncle, Captain Scott, prompts Andrew's surprise rejection of the farm in favor of making the trip himself. The ensuing two acts of the drama entail, with surprisingly little stage action, the slow deterioration of first the farm, and then of Robert's health. It is worth looking in some detail at how the rhetoric of ecological consonance and dissonance plays out within these developments to understand how fully Beyond the Horizon is primarily a play of environmental imagination. Family dynamics within the Mayo household adhere closely to expectations based on particular ecological affinities. Captain Scott relates sea stories (including an interminable yarn about where sea gulls sleep) to the family, trying to pull first Robert, and then Andrew into his sphere of influence. His brother-in-law, James Mayo, protests that Andrew is a Mayo "bred in the bone, and he's a born farmer" (588). This genealogy of the soil is disrupted when the brothers abruptly switch positions. Andrew disowns his "breeding" by claiming to be "sick and tired of the whole damn business," and announcing that he suddenly "hate[s] the farm and every inch of ground in it. I'm sick of digging in the dirt and sweating in the sun" (597). Robert by contrast declares that he will settle on the farm and prove to his father that he is "as good a Mayo as you are, or Andy" (592). Family identity here attaches as much to an ecological niche as it does to actual bloodlines. The stunned adults try to reorder their understanding by attributing the sons' shifting affiliations to the love spat over Ruth: The farmer Mayo invokes a maritime metaphor in telling Scott, "You can't order the tides on the sea to suit you, and I ain't pretendin' I can reg'late love for young folks" (593). But the question of how, and why, the two boys exchange positions in their attachment to the land is larger than Ruth's influence can account for. In the end, it is this environmental rearrangement that will determine their fates. After Andrew leaves with Scott to sail south, Robert and Ruth run the farm to near ruin. O'Neill's opening stage direction for the second act is a fine example of how he uses environmental description to capture mood: . .] a hot, sun-baked day in mid-summer, three years later All the windows are open but no wind stirs the soiled white curtains. A patched screen door is in the rear. Through it the yard can be seen, its small stretch of lawn divided by the dirt path [...]" (602). It does not take long for Robert himself to voice the misery of his misplacement in the rural environment, cursing the very hills he used to believe held promise, and comparing his beloved horizon to the "walls of a narrow prison yard" (614). Andrew's brief return in the second scene of act</page><page sequence="16">Robert Baker-White 63 2 allows him to see the physical and moral erosion of life on the farm, but also brings a fresh perspective on some of the assumptions about environment revealed earlier. Specifically, Andrew's voyages have left him more a realist about the supposed freedom of the open seas, recalling storms that made him think: "This'd cure Rob of them ideas about the beautiful sea" (620). This draining of romance from the alternative to what (Karl) Marx and Engels famously called the "idiocy of rural life" (477) makes the entire Mayo universe seem bleak indeed. The second revelation that Andrew brings comes in his comparison of the small New England farm to what he has seen in Argentina. Andrew explains to Robert: "We call this a farm?but you ought to hear about the farms down there?ten square miles where we've got an acre. It's a big new country where big things are opening up" (621). Andrew's interest, as later events will reveal, is not simply in the new vistas of big land, but rather in how he might specifically profit from his involvement there. He continues to Robert, " [...] I want to get in on something big before I die. I'm no fool when it comes to farming, and I know something about grain. I've been reading up a lot on it, too, lately" (621). The ironic detail that O'Neill inserts here into the brothers' relationship?Andrew speaking of "reading up" on farming, after he has, in act 1, ridiculed the coexistence of books and soil as antithetical elements?will have resonance in act 3 as the consequences of Andrew's new, instrumental attitude toward the land are revealed. It is in the final act that irony turns toward O'Neill's tragic vision. The action of the final scenes is predicated on an environmental event?the rise of the sun, which Robert insists on seeing as "an augury of good fortune" (637). Yet it is obvious to Ruth, and to the audience, that Robert is in fact dying. While O'Neill sets the opening of this act inside the tumbledown house, he reinforces the established trajectory of environmental decay through descriptions of the characters themselves, who physically take on the derelict state of the farm. Specifically Ruth, whose appearance in act 2 had "lost its youth and freshness" and had also become "hard and spiteful" (606), now in act 3 has "aged horribly," her face conveying a "stony lack of expression" (631) that specifically mimics the depleted natural environment. The apotheosis of this reverse anthropomorphic characterization comes with the news that the child Mary has died eight months prior, thus sealing the identity of the farm as a place of decrease rather than increase?of spoilage rather than growth and ripening. In the face of these realities, Robert still protests that they can start life anew, if they can "shake off the curse of this farm" (635). O'Neill also here gives Robert words that the playwright will later renounce specifically to his two urban friends, as Robert implores Ruth that they might head to the city "where people live instead of stagnating" (635). He again curses the "damned</page><page sequence="17">64 The Eugene O'Neill Review hills," and stares out the window waiting for sunrise. Andrew arrives, shocked at his brother's desperate state, and reinvigorates the idyllic vision of working the land, vowing to reengage with "hard work in the open?just like I used to in the old days" (643). Andrew has lost huge sums of money speculating on grain futures in the Argentine market, but as Robert pointedly tells him, there is a "spiritual significance" to his loss that goes beyond finance. Robert confronts him with the manner in which he has lost his inherited connection to the land, calling him the "deepest-eyed failure" of the three of them: "You?a farmer?to gamble in a wheat pit with scraps of paper. [. . .] You've spent eight years running away from yourself. [...] You used to be a creator when you loved the farm. You and life were in harmonious partnership" (646-47). In Robert's view, sentimentality and economic complexity crash together through Andrew's hubris. Robert's attempt to stay with the land has cost him his family and ultimately his life, yet Andrew's "running away" from the land he professed to love has cost him in "spiritual" terms that, Robert implies, are even more costly. In the play's final scene, Robert escapes the dark home and returns to the section of highway where the drama began. Again O'Neill employs novelistic description to set the environmental scene: The sky to the east is alight with bright color and a thin quavering line of flame is spreading slowly along the horizon rim of the dark hills. The roadside, however, is steeped in the grayness of the dawn, shadowy and vague. The field in the foreground has a wild uncultivated appearance as if it had been allowed to remain fallow the preceding summer. Parts of the snake-fence in the rear ha ve been broken down. The apple tree is leafless and seems dead. (651) Robert, aware that he is dying, speaks of his desire to meld with the natural environment that has conditioned his life so fully: "So I thought I'd try to end as I might have?if I'd had the courage?alone?in a ditch by the open road? watching the sun rise" (652). With Ruth and Andrew at his side, Robert eventually sees the sun come up, which allows him simultaneously to feel freed from the demands of the farm, and to again, finally see beauty in the surrounding hills: "You mustn't feel sorry for me. Don't you see I'm happy at last?free?free!?freed from the farm?free to wander on and on?eternally! (He raises himself on his elbow, his face radiant, and points to the horizon) Look! Isn't it beautiful beyond the hills? I can hear the old voices calling me to come?(exultantly) And this time I'm going!" (652). O'Neill closes the drama with Robert's death, and he leaves unresolved how Andrew and Ruth will continue to wrestle with their own relations to the simultaneously cursed and beautiful land. Conventional readings of Beyond the Horizon have hardly failed to</page><page sequence="18">Robert Baker-White 65 recognize each character's relation to the land as a major thematic and structural component within the drama. The most succinct example comes from Travis Bogard, who writes of O'Neill's novel "use of man's desire to belong to nature as the source of tragic action," and of a "tragic disharmony with nature" at the center of Robert and Andrew's plight. Bogard elaborates, writing plainly, "If Andrew had stayed on the farm, if Robert had gone to sea, each would have held true to his essential nature and been able to live in harmony with the elements around him" (127-129). But the very notion of "essential nature" is complicated by an evolutionary reading of the brothers' responses to the play's fictional stimuli. In developing an evolutionary approach to literature generally, Jay Appleton has posited that characters may behave as "natural" agents within a fictional setting, searching out, for instance, either a vision granting prospect from which to survey survival alternatives, or a sheltering refuge which provides protection from hazard (63-67). Appleton also cites the work of S.C. Bourassa, whose The Aesthetics of Landscape furthers Appleton's own evolutionary investigation by positing three interrelated types of law which govern response to physical environment. First, "cross-cultural, genetically transmitted elements of survival behavior" may be considered as "biological laws" to which all people are, to some extent, subject. Second, any individual's group imposes "its own system of values, its own criteria of excellence, determined in accordance with its own fashions, customs and conventions," and these may be classified together as a set of "cultural laws" that also determine people's attitude toward physical circumstance. Finally, "each individual forges his own personal strategy, his own unique mix of meanings, preferences, and typical behavioral responses, out of his inherited behavior patterns and within the context of the cultural rules imposed by the group"?and these "personal strategies" also must be considered in evaluating response to the environment (Appleton 242-43). In the case of the Mayo brothers, any inherited, "biological" response to the idyll of the farm is clearly differentiated by conflicting cultural customs and conventions, including Robert's schooling and indulgence of poetry and idealistic yearnings, which are contrasted by Andrew's embrace of rural values of industry and proper care of the farm business. Yet even these cultural attachments are further split by personal strategies that emerge in the context of the complicated love triangle, resulting in the counter-intuitive choices each character makes. In all instances the relation to the land is crucial, but O'Neill does not simply deploy one-dimensional characters whose attachments are easily read; rather he creates human characters whose shifting understanding of their own ecological situatedness confounds their happiness in myriad ways. Struggling with these understandings, Robert and Andrew reveal a human complexity that outstrips any singular desire for prospect (Robert's</page><page sequence="19">66 The Eugene O'Neill Review wish to gain vistas beyond the line of horizon), or for refuge (Andrew's initial dream of settling into the protective valley of the family farm), but rather implies the necessity for mobile and flexible responses to such natural environmental possibilities. In some ways it is their inability to adapt and improvise (after the fateful choice that each makes in act 1) that dooms the brothers. Differentiating the tragic and comic spirits in literature, Joseph W. Meeker contrasts the former's sense of overreaching with the latter's humility and appropriateness of scale. "Tragedy does not imitate the conditions of life, but creates artificial conditions which men mimic in their attempts to attain the flattering illusions of dignity and honor" (37). The comic spirit, by contrast, for Meeker admits of the fact that "[M]an is part of nature and subject to all natural limitations and flaws" (37). Meeker's differentiation provides a useful vantage for seeing Beyond the Horizon as a tragedy that privileges an inability to accord with nature as a primary confound, for it is the hubristic strength of their cultural and personal drives, in a sense, their own personal ideologies, that mark Robert and Andrew as ineffective survivors. Beyond the Horizon may be O'Neill's most cutting denunciation of environmental mythology. As Patrick Diggins observes, "To our contemporary moralists who tell us that at one time in American history values were born on the farm and sustained in the family, an encounter with [. . .] Beyond the Horizon comes as a shock" (170). And the ecological terrain that O'Neill chooses to excoriate here is his native New England soil, which for the young playwright "had become a bloodstained patriarchy, a land of lost grace and Puritan sin" (Kushner 251). The hollowness of the "rural values" embodied by the successful family farm is revealed most strikingly in Robert's seething exposure of Andy's entirely instrumental approach to the fruits of labor in his Argentine futures trading. O'Neill reveals quite plainly the potency of Twain's "pilot's dilemma," describing through the plot of Beyond the Horizon a dual identity of "farm" as both Edenic locale and systematic engine of potential wealth that fits closely the knot of sentimental and complex pastoralism. In the end it is the characters' inability to hold these two conceptions in any sort of balanced relation that brings about their downfall. O'Neill's response to initial criticism of the original production of Beyond theHorizonhebps underscore how deeply his ecological imagination permeates the drama. Each of the play's three acts is split into two scenes, one exterior and one interior. Alexander Woollcott, the influential New York Times critic whose praise did much to ensure the success of this, O'Neill's first Broadway production, found fault with the scenic structure precisely because of its "impractical" scene breaks. As the Gelbs point out, Woollcott's criticism in this regard hit "at the heart of O 'Neill's technique" (411). Having claimed that</page><page sequence="20">Robert Baker-White 67 the playwright must forego "a novelist's luxuries" of scene description, Woollcott admonished O'Neill for breaking the "spell" of illusionistic theatricality by interrupting the action so frequently. He also commented that the images O'Neill wished to capture in the scenography?"The decaying farm, the beckoning road, the imprisoning hills and the sea beyond the horizon"?could have more effectively been conjured for the audience through the spoken words of the characters (qtd. in Gelb 411). At these criticisms O'Neill bristled, partly because he had known precisely what he was doing in constructing the play as he did, and because his thinking was exactly geared toward a kind of scenic communication that was not available through traditional dialogue. O'Neill would write of these choices that the exterior setting suggested "man's desire and dream," and that the interior, with the horizon gone, suggested "what has come between him and his dream." In that way I tried to get rhythm, the alternation of longing and of loss. Probably very few people who saw the play knew that this was definitely planned to produce the effect. But I am sure they all unconsciously get the effect. It is often easier to express an idea through such means than through words or mere copies of real actions, (qtd. in Gelb 411-412) Such insistence by O'Neill that natural rhythms themselves inform the structure of the play (the fading light in act 1, scene 1 that turns to darkness in scene 2; the blackness that grows to eventual sunrise in act 3, etc.) is reminiscent of the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein 's observation that "The organic unity of a work, as well as the sense of organic unity received from the work, arises when the law of the construction of this work corresponds to the laws of the structure of organic phenomena of nature" (qtd. in Eagle x). O 'Neill himself would later remark, "People do not know how sensitive they are to rhythm," (qtd. in Sheaffer, Son and Playwright 419) and that his unorthodox stagecraft in Beyond the Horizon was a "deliberate departure in form in search of greater flexibility" (qtd. in Sheaffer, Son and Artist 11). If in the end we agree with Frank Cunningham that O'Neill's "great objective in Beyond the Horizon was to show man as capable of organic growth in a dynamic universe" (66), then surely we must acknowledge that the dramatic representation of that dynamism comes primarily through his persistent and groundbreaking attempts to deliver nature itself as a powerful player upon the stage.</page><page sequence="21">68 The Eugene O'Neill Review NOTES 1 This treatment of Smith's argument appeared previously in Baker-White, Robert, "Questioning the Ground of American Identity: George Pierce Baker's The Pilgrim Spiritand Suzan-Lori Parks's The America Play" The Journal of American Drama and Theatre 12.2 (Spring 2000): 91-99. 2 See Chaudhuri, Staging Place 55.
