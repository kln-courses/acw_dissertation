<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE From the hermeneutic point of view science is an attempt, whol- ly sui generis, at the exposition and explanation of the world accord- ing to rules and criteria that are essentially different from those of everyday, and from those of mythical, metaphysical, and aesthetic ex- perience. The latter are nonetheless concomitant with the former and as these modes of experience pervade each other it may subsequently be difficult even to draw an exact line between them. The idea of an autonomous science sprang from the endeavor to achieve a fully in- dependent inquiry with its own criteria and rules as to method, veri- fication, and aim. This does not alter the fact that the idea of science, also as regards this internal aspect, where it is bent on autonomy, is a product of history. Although it is correctly translated as 'knowl- edge' and 'science' the Greek concept of episteme by no means coin- cides with the modern concept of science, or with that of the classi- cal-modern period. At the outset certainty of knowledge was the main consideration and the way in which this certainty was achieved, by formal demon- stration and method (axiomatic method, analytic, and synthetic method) made mathematics until the 18th century the model of all science; yes, into science proper, the concept of science being identi- cal with apodictic, complete, and rigorously demonstrated, certainty. By this standard physics likewise was measured. Not until the 19th century did physics rise to the status of model of empirical science. The knowledge of the empirical regularity of nature - still consid- ered by Kant to be of a lower order because as humans we are un- able to recognize the supposed necessity of the laws of nature - en- ables one to predict in principle the future course of events. In order to do' so, rigorous requirements of precision, exactitude, verification, and checks of all data and facts, have to be satisfied. In this way a relation between knowledge and the possibility of prediction comes about. It would then be correct to say of empirical science that it has only then reached the stage of genuine empiricism, when it is able in principle to predict events with the methods and techniques it has de- veloped, on the ground of an exact knowledge of the conditions that determine the rise and the course of these events. This knowledge is attained by means of experiments, i.e., by means of a theoretically 60</page><page sequence="2">THIE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 61 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE warranted experimental arrangement and the artificial isolation of a process. Such an experiment should be repeatable and so be amen- able to checking and verification. The antecedent conception, that is to say, the theory and the design of a model are of paramount impor- tance in this. In the case of Kant the keen appreciation of it even leads to an antecedent, necessary, conception of a formal concept of nature as a prerequisite for having experience at all (an a priori for- mal concept of nature.) Less known in its historic origin and as to the part it has fulfilled in the development of the ideal of knowledge, is the relation between understanding and making. Yet there is no relation that so strongly joins together myth, metaphysics, and science as just this one. None either in which the role of analogy and model have been so important right from the beginning. In our time we are fully aware of the impor- tant function which the conception of a model has for the advance of our knowledge. The significance of a general theory of the model has been recognized in the philosophy of science and in the most recent times more than usual attention has been devoted to it. Only too keenly does one realize the importance of this in the progress and development of physics, astromony, biology as well as in other sci- ences, in the actual practice of science itself therefore. Nowhere is this becoming more evident than in information and communication theory, in cybernetics, and in the technological sphere of the elec- tronic computer. Precisely in this latter field the relation between un- derstanding and making is forging ahead in the most impressive way, now that the function of the brain and the central nervous system is being understood in analogy with the function of the electronic com- puter. Automation and the development of the electronic computer in- augurate a new period in the history of science and civilization. Apart from the rise of an increasingly close relationship between science and technology there is the fact that in this process man has taken a road on which in growing measure he understands himself, not only biologically, but also mentally, in terms of, and in connection with the machines he has devised.' I "Man is to us the 'unknown being.' Our comprehension of the function of our intellectual apparatus is slender. Now, if suddenly comparable characteristics can be produced by automata ('mechanical intelligence'), a new avenue opens up to the in- quiring mind for the understanding of man: namely, by way of an understanding of the automata."

It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this princi- ple for the whole of the future life of mankind, because of the numer- ous fresh possibilities entailed by the technical mastery of our en- vironment and the ability also to interfere with man and his ways of life and culture. Linschoten, who despite his connection with pheno- menology can be considered to be a representative of the coming trend toward devising what he correctly calls reductive models also in psychology, puts this in no uncertain terms: 'There is a search (in the sciences of man, that is) for that type of reductive model that will enable us to describe, predict and if possible produce conduct.' And to meet the objection put forward on the part of phenomenology against a reductionist approach in the sciences of man, namely, that in such an approach the essentially human is not done full justice, he reassuringly remarks that this approach will do as little violence to the human as the musical score does to music, on condition that the music is not identified with the score. Nevertheless, accordingly to the remark towards the end of his paper, the possibility of creating music is fully contained in the score.2 K. Steinbuch, however, goes far beyond this. He is of the opinion that there is no fundamental difference between man and automation (= the electronic, self-regulating, machine devised by man.) When confronted with those who again and again rely for their argument on the things the computer cannot perform, he takes it to be a matter of the future development of information theory on the one hand and of technique on the other, whether the differences, such as spontan- eity and initiative, will last or whether they will be overcome. This holds good, too, notably for the reading and the understanding of the spoken and the written word. The view that these are intellectual ac- tivities that can be performed only by man he deems erroneous and in any case premature. This view is due to a deep-seated preconcep- tion, as up till now only a matter of the logical analysis of mental processes and of the future technical development of computers. These will have the result that reading and comprehension will be- 2 J. Linschoten, "Phenomenologie en Psychologie," Alg. Ned. Tijdschr. v.

Information and communication theory as the basis of cy- bernetics does therefore involve much more than a knock on the door of the human mind and the intellectual activities of man. The grow- ing obtrusion of mathematical methods and techniques in the sci- ences of man, from psychology to economics, is the handwriting on 'the wall and carries with it a growing acceptance of depersonaliza- tion and formalization here as well (one should bear in mind the mathematical models of learning processes.)4 The conception of fellowmen as persons with whom we enter in- to a personal I-thou relationship would be an anthropomorphic way of seeing daily life, possibly a formulation in I-thou protocol as against the objective 'it-protocol' of information theory. The transfer of mathematical and physical models to the field of the sciences of man leads to formal constructions and in general to the reduction of the human mind to automatisms and mechanisms. There is no doubt that a situation is arising here in which two epistemological ideals clash: the ideal of physical science and the ideal of what in German philosophy of science, with all kinds of vari- ations, is usually called the sciences of mind, or, to put it more gener- ally, the epistemological ideal that was mostly adhered to in the sci- ences of man. According to the ideal of physical science we are not primarily concerned with truth as Linschoten bluntly states, but with relevant knowledge that enables us to control the phenomena. This 3 K.

The optical reader has in the meantime actually been constructed. 4 At this point Linschoten's remark about the connection between formalization and the machine model is of interest: "The model is the way in which, in the process of formalization, the various characteristics of the phenomenon under investigation are grasped in their mutual. relations: as a system of variables, the values of which vary over a given period under specificable conditions. This definition of 'system' as the object of scientific research is at the same time the most general definition of 'ma- chine'." It is this definition which makes the machine model of behavior have general application.

It is a freakish turn in the vicissitudes of ter- minology, that the term technology gained currency in the 17th cen- tury precisely to refer to the study and system of the artes liberates. Although, because of the practical frame of mind and aims, the ac- quisition of a mastery of the artes came into it, all the same this hap- pened in a spirit, entirely different from what is envisaged at the pre- sent moment.' Later on Marx and others use the term to refer to practical knowledge and the production of capital resources.6 At pre- sent, taking their lead from the latest development in the transfer of knowledge and the programming of teaching, people speak even of 'education technology.' Still this is utterly harmless compared with the violation of the claims of the epistemological ideal itself. The very thing these claims asserted was the superiority of the sciences of man, as these occupy themselves with the things which man himself has made, and which 5 'Technology' already occurs in Greek, e.g. twice at the beginning of Dionysius Longinus, peri hypsous, (On the Sublime, 1st cent. A.D., first publ. by Robertello in 1554, meaning systematic treatment of a techne, namely grammar or rhetoric). In 1606 Timpler published a system of metaphysics called: Technologia sive tractatus generalis de natura et differentia artium liberalism, a general methodology of the 'sciences,' that is, as a kind of preliminary to his metaphysics. (Cf. 0. Ritschl, System und systematis- che Methode in der Geschichte des wissenschaftlichen Sprachgebrauchs und der philoso- phischen Methodologie, Bonn, 1906, p. 32.) Wolff means by technology 'the theory of the non-manual, aesthetical and ethical rules of artistic activity' (Fr. Delekat, Imm. Kant, 1966, p. 240). According to him this is a till now neglected philosophy of the arts "possibilis quoque est philosophia artium, etsi hactenus neglecta. Eam Technicam aut Technologiam appellate posses." (Although hitherto neglected a philosophy of the arts is also possible, which you could call technique or technology), Logic. disc. prael., 71). J. G. Walch, Philosophisches Lexicon, Leipzig, 1726, c. 2515) on the other hand paraphrases 'technoloch(g)y' only as 'the theory of artificial terms, by which is usually meant the kind of words that refer to matters that are peculiar to persons of a certain craft or profession.' This concerns therefore only what we now still call technical terminology. 6 Cf. below p. 72. This usage has persisted, unlike the one, of the scholastic tradition of the artes liberates, which after having managed to survive into the 18th century with Baumgarten is now not even remembered. If one compares with this the para- phrase in The Universal Dictionary of the English Language, ed. by H. C. Wyld (1946): technology: 'Science and history of the mechanical and industrial arts, contrasted with the fine arts,' then the complete change is very marked indeed, as is the similarity to Marx (cf. below p. 72 of this paper). If on the other hand we turn to the Dictionaire de l'Academie franfaise (1935): 'Science, treatise of the arts in general, a complete tech- nology. It also refers to the whole of the terms peculiar to an art, a science, or a craft' (cf. also adj. technological), then one wonders whether this refers to a surviving tradition, or simply to a continuation of a paraphrase dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, which has ignored the fact that we are now living in a "technical era."'</page><page sequence="6">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 65 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE therefore, in contradistinction to the phenomena of nature, could more easily and completely be grasped than the latter. It was Giovanni Battista Vico who put the connection between verum and factum more sharply and more emphatically than any- body had done before him. Although Vico was not recognized in his own time and his influence on later thought does not unmistakably and distinctly become evident, this influence has nevertheless been greater than used to be supposed in an earlier period. His influence on Marx is especially surprising here. Marx first learned about Vico through Michelet, before acquiring a firsthand knowledge of his work. It was Marx who recognized and adopted the connection, put forward by Vico, between verum and factum, which has even pro- cured him a place of honor in the history of Marxism. Although he was known to Herder, Goethe, Jacobi, and Hegel, Vico's influence on German theory of science was negligible. The latter put more stress on the identity of subject and object and remained for a long time too much captivated by a psychologistic conception of the theory of understanding to make the connection between verum and factum its basis, although this point of view is not altogether absent from Dilthey and others. Quite apart from this question, it is of even greater importance to subject the thesis of the reversibility of the relation between truth and understanding on the one hand and the ability to make on the other, to an overall examination and, moreover not just in the context of the whole of classical modern thought, from Kepler, Galileo, Des- cartes, to Hegel, lut also in the context of man's attempt at under- standing reality. It appears after all that this understanding from its very beginnings, therefore all the more so in primitive and mythic thought, has allowed itself to be guided by analogies, comparisons, and models that were drawn not only from everyday experience in general but by preference from the crafts, that is from things man- made. H. Gomperz has put some order into this matter and has distin- guished among four patterns of thinking, which recur in all kinds of variations: biological (in the narrow sense of the word), anthropolo- gical (plans and deliberation), theological, political, artistic (creation motive), and mechanical patterns. The latter ones especially are based on a comparison and an identification with the procedure fol- lowed in the crafts.7 7 H. Gomperz, "Problem and Methods of Early Greek Science" (1943), Philosophical Studies, Boston, 1953, pp. 72-87.</page><page sequence="7">66 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Now one would to some extent be justified in assuming philo- sophical and scientific thought to have raised themselves above the primitive and anthropomorphic nature of these analogies and models and to have left it far behind. Still, those that are more or less ac- quainted with the debate on the relation between man and machine and the question whether man is a machine, or rather is comparable to a machine, are only too well aware of the fact that the progress of theory and scientific insight has been, it is true, very considerable, but that the leading character of the machine model, especially now this has advanced from tool to electronic machine, has become a more urgent issue than ever, because this model has reached a new phase, namely that of man himself. And not in philosophical theory, but in the theory and praxis of modern science. The primitive man- machine theory of de la Mettrie is only in its rudiments comparable to the theory of Norbert Wiener and K. Steinbuch. One will get a better understanding of the situation in which we find ourselves and acquire a more workable point of view in regard to the whole history of European metaphysics and science, if one puts the issue as follows; that the whole of this history has been a struggle about the usefulness, the value and the meaning of the vari- ous patterns of thinking we have mentioned, and that in European thought the model of the machine has dominated, and today in the sciences is scoring its greatest triumphs. Three phases can be distinguished in the application of this mod- el: (i) the application of the mechanical model with respect to the world, the universe, the world-machine of the 17th and 18th centuries, an expression first used by Lucretius (De Natura Rerum V. 95): moles et machine mundi; occasionally translated as 'artifact'; (ii) to the human body and animated nature (Vesalius, Descartes) and (iii) with respect to human actions and the human mind (automata, auto- matisms, and mechanisms). Initially mechanical and intentional ex- planation are not incompatible and did manage to go together as is shown by Kepler's repudiation of the conception of the cosmos as a living being (Plato's Timaios): 'What I propose is this, that the hea- venly machine is not like a living being of divine nature or origin, but resembles a clock - he who believes that the clock has a soul diverts the glory from the maker to the work - in which almost all the changes in motion are effected by just one single corporeal magnetic virtue, just as all the motions in the clock are effected by one sole weight.'8 8 Letter of 10 February 1605, op. I, 84.</page><page sequence="8">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 67 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE The designation of God as opifex optimums maximus), as archi- tect, supreme master builder, as fabricator, and of what has been made as fabrica (to be compared with less sophisticated similes such as potter, smith, weaver) allows the world itself to be seen as ma- china or fabrica. A machine is after all something that has itself been made and serves a specific purpose and has a particular function.' The designation 'mechanical philosophy' for physics ('philosophy' = 'science') was, following in the footsteps of Descartes, first used by Robert Boyle. It would be incorrect to assume that this designation, or the laws of mechanics, have not or no longer have anything to do with machina. This connection is not just etymological: the machine model is inseparable from mechanics. The somewhat crude simile of universe and clock not only lasted from Kepler, and figured promin- ently in the issue whether this clock did not imply a clockmaker, up to Voltaire and Paley, but in Descartes we find a striking and sur- prising attempt at explaining in the case of man the vegetative func- tions and organs of animated nature with the help of automata.-" In the Principia Philosophiae IV, 203 he insists that he cannot al- low a distinction between artificial bodies (arte facta) and natural ones. The only difference is in the magnitude of the action of what has been artificially man-made, whereas in nature such extremely small instruments (organs) are used that they escape observation. Consequently the calculations and considerations entertained in mechanics also hold in physics. What is easily ascertainable in the works of automata like timepieces can, although invisible, also be guessed in the case of the corpora naturalia.11 Whereas the Greeks in 9 Cf. Kant, Opus Postumum, p. 193: 'As every machine, considered as such, is a body consisting of fixed parts, which have a motive power based on and directed towards certain purposes, one must conceive of it in analogy with an artifact, as the product of an efficient cause having intelligence, that is as the product of an author - even if no such cause for it could actually be found.' Still other conceptual definitions of the machine are to be found in Kant. 10"Traitd de 1'Homme," Works of Descartes, ed. by Ch. Adam and P. Tannery, XI, p. 120. 11"I can see no other difference between these, i.e., the artifacts, and the natural bodies, save only that the action of the artifacts, is for the most part performed by instruments so big that they can be easily perceived by the senses: this being necessary if they are to be constructed by man. Natural action, on the contrary, depends almost always on some instrument so minute that it wholly escapes observation. And in fact there are no procedures in mechanics that would not be applicable in physics as well, of which it is a part or special case: it is absolutely as natural for a timepiece, no matter of which cogs it is made up, to tell the time, as it is for a tree to produce a particular fruit, no matter from which seed the tree has grown."</page><page sequence="9">68 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the relation of nature (phusis) and art technoe) took nature as the prototype, Descartes here turns it around: nature is explained and understood in analogy with human apparatus. Basically there is no difference. Nevertheless - all things considered - a totally different attitude to the naturally given is shown here; while at the same time the distinction between a purely mechanical and a teleological ex- planation arises at this point. This is usually referred to as the strug- gle of modern science against Aristotelianism, but it obscures the real issue of purely mechanical determinism as exhaustive explana- tion versus the requirement of purposiveness and a meaning-infusing principle within or above nature. Both these explanations are based on the machine model. Owing to their incompatibility, it is now, with this mechanical model that the intentional moment - the orientation towards purposiveness - recedes or, rather is ousted by the former. In the other explanation this moment is emphasized, nature being thought of as art, connected with which an intention is to be as- sumed."2 In Kant's Critique of Judgment this antithetical relationship is for the last time thoroughly and critically thrashed out in connec- tion with the metaphysical problem to which the relation between nature (phusis) and art technoe) gave rise. That this has never been recognized or seen as such is another problem with which the inter- pretation of Kant's third Critique finds itself faced."3 I want to confine myself here merely to suggesting that what this book is really about is the critical examination of the construction of nature as a tech- nique, namely as a product of art. This is also the way in which we should interpret Kant's well-known saying that we can only under- stand to the extent that we can ourselves make. This statement purports to define the limits of our understand- ing of nature. The fact is that what we cannot make ourselves like- wise transcend our actual and real comprehension. So far this reali- zation of a limit of our understanding of nature (Kant has organisms in mind) constitutes a counterpart to the equally familiar pronounce- ment to be found in the Preface to the Second Edition of the Critique of Pure Reason. It appears that the limitation has to do with the limitation that physics imposes on itself in the understanding and explanation of na- ture. This limitation to the mechanism of nature precisely corres- 12 Kant, Opus Postumum, p. 341: 'God, the world and the creator of the world.

This implies the possibility of producing the phenomena according to the laws of nature itself. The organization of nature, of what Kant himself later calls organism,14 as the inner purpose of nature, defies genuine reproduction by human ingenuity. The possibilities present in the organic life of nature, that is to say, the fact that the organs or instruments are interdependent and constitute a whole in which the constituent parts determine the whole and the whole the parts, are beyond our understanding. With this Kant gave the impulse to a distinction, which only through Schelling, as a philosopher of nature, and the romantic think- ers, grew into a sharp contrast: the distinction between animated or- ganic nature (= so instrumented that the instruments in their inter- dependence determine each other structurally and function as a whole) and inanimate nature. The distinction between organic and inorganic nature and natur- al science, organic and inorganic chemistry, was until then unknown in this rigorous form. After Kant had critically prepared the ground for it in his study on the 'Technique of Nature,' it found general ac- ceptance (though only thanks to the philosopher of nature, Schel- ling) and did not fail to have its influence even on the science of bio- logy. Kant himself, however, did not deny the latter the right to try to find a mechanistic explanation: it cannot and may not do anything else. Teleological explanation is not within its province, but belongs as 'preliminary' or transitional stage to the theologia naturalis. Hobbes, while recognizing the importance of Galileo as the found- er of the philosophia naturalis, was the first in c 1 a s s i c a 1 modern thought to set against this a principle that gave the philosophia civil- is a standing on a par with that of mathematics. The latter owes its force to the possibility of rigorous demonstration. This rests on noth- ing else but the possibility of deriving the results from its own opera- tions: the lines and figures from which we reason are drawn and des- cribed by ourselves. That means that we have to do here with a sci- ence that has been derived from a prior knowledge of the 'causes,' that is of their origin and construction. Where there is knowledge of causes there is room for demonstration. If this is not the case as with natural bodies, then we do not know the construction, and conse- quently there is no demonstration possible either, but instead we 14 Kant, Opus Postumum, p. 185: 'Organism is the form of a body, considered as a machine, i.e., as instrument of movement for a particular purpose.'</page><page sequence="11">70 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH must start from the effects and seek to derive the possible causes from these.-" In this stage of the argument Hobbes draws a parallel between mathematics and the philosophia civilis. The latter too is supposed to be demonstrable because we make the commonwealth ourselves. Vico was directly and indirectly acquainted with this fundamen- tal idea of Hobbes and he took it as the starting point for his Scienza Nuova: the history of culture (humanitas) is better known to us than nature as the former is of our own making. Kant too must have known of this, for from his work as well the idea prominently emer- ges that mathematics constructs its own objects by means of defini- tions, even if on the basis of intuition, namely of the intuitional forms, space and time. Philosophy is not in a position to do the same; although philosophy is the a priori analysis of concepts, it is in doing so always dependent on possible experience. Be that as it may, I shall not enter here into this relation, between mathematics and philo- sophy, which has given rise to all sorts of misunderstandings. The passage in the Critique of Judgment just m e n t io n e d, in which Kant maintains that we understand "only what we ourselves can make, refers exclusively to the place and significance of experi- ments in physical science and not, as in the case of Hobbes and Vico, to the application of this axiom to what are traditionally called the moral sciences (sciences morales et politiques, moralische Wissen- schaften, and later Geisteswissenschaften). Experiment, mechanism, and making are, according to Kant, closely linked. Making is only possible with respect to a mechanism. It appears from the context that he is thinking here in the first place of the limits imposed on physical science. Experimental physical sci- ence simulates natural processes as much as possible according to corresponding natural laws; it bans all teleological considerations and confines itself to the merely mechanical because the latter can be copied in the same kind of way. No Newton, however, will arise, able to make a blade of grass as this presupposes a knowledge of the inner possibility. In classical-modern thought and especially in the work of Vico the idea is expressed that it is not we who have made nature, but that nature was created by God. God as Maker knows what He has made. Contrasted with this are mathematics and the world of man. In the world of man, man is equal to God because there he can understand what he has made himself. Construction and demonstration are most 15 Hobbes, De cive (1642).

In physics on the contrary we are unable to demonstrate: si physical demonstrate possemus, faceremus. With Marx the technological aspect predominates in his appro- priation of Vico's thesis that man makes his own history."' Technolo- gy occupies an important place in the revolutionary nature of mod- ern industry. The technical basis of modern industry is revolutionary as opposed to the conservative character of all previous methods of production. The fact is that modern industry rests on the methodical and systematic application of physical science. This application fol- lowing the principle of analyzing each process of production into its constituent elements without paying attention to the human hand he calls the modern science of technology. In the note in which he speaks of Vico he draws a parallel between Darwin, whose attention was directed towards the history of natural technology, viz., the for- mation of plant and animal organs as means of production for the lives of plants and animals, and the formative history of the produc- tive organizations of man, living in the form of society as the mater- ial basis of all social organization. Now, in connection with this parallel, which goes to the root of his own work, Marx wonders if this formative history will not be easier to give than the one that was envisaged by Darwin 'as, accord- ing to Vico, the history of man differs from that of nature in that we have made the former and not the latter.' Technology, he contin- ues, and with that he is obviously not referring to the above-mention- ed application of physical science to the process of production, but to scientific research into the 'formative history of the productive or- ganization of man as a social being' - reveals the immediate process of production of his life and so of his social living relations and the ideas springing from them. It appears from this that Marx incorporates Vico's fundamental idea in his theory of historical materialism, which aims at remedying the shortcomings of abstract scientific materialism. In doing so he 16 Vico is mentioned only in an important note in Das Kapital. For the considerable influence the reading of Vico had on Marx, which even justifies the thesis that the fundamental idea of Vico is the basis of the development of historical materialism, cf. M. H. Fisch and Th. G. Bergin, The Autobiography of Giambattista Vico, Ithaca, N. Y., 1944, pp. 104-107. There one finds all the necessary documentation for appreciat- ing that this seemingly incidental reference to Vico in a note carries far more weight than this passing mention suggests. The influence of Vico in different fields of sciences and philosophy is now treated more extensively and by several authors in: Giambattista Vico, An International Symposium,.ed. by Giorgio Tagliocozzo and Hayden V. White. Baltimore, 1969. Pp. 147 - 598.</page><page sequence="13">72 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH gives a surprising turn, unforeseen by Vico himself, to the latter's fundamental idea by involving in it the function of tool and machine in the totality of the rise and development of economic life. Having followed the rise of the methodological axiom (so impor- tant today) that only what can be made can be understood and having considered the significance the axiom has had for some of the promi- nent figures and representatives of classical-modern thought: what do we find? First it shows how the thinkers of the day following in the foot- steps of Galileo first applied the axiom to mathematics and how this science - or art - was explained as a construction of concepts, in which man fills the part of maker or creator. As a reaction against Descartes' misappreciation of history, history then became the very science to which the axiom was applied, being the science of what is made by man. This is the case with Vico, but also, curiously enough, with Marx, who made this point of view the basis of this theory of the all-embracing importance of technology for human existence. Thanks to this theory his use of the term 'technology' is ambiguous. After all, this term denotes for one thing the technical application of physical science, for another, the knowledge of the formative history of the means of production: the hand, as the tool of all tools; the tool; the machine.17 Only Kant reflects the meaning which since Galileo, Huygens, and Newton began to be assigned to experimental physics in the con- text of the mechanization of the world picture; but at the same time he attaches a qualification to this application: this making is denied with regard to organic life, despite the fact that it is the task of phy- sical science there as well to carry on with the mechanical explana- tion as intrinsically belonging to its task. The latter has at this very time become increasingly important for modern physical science. Vico's reversal of verum and factum, meant to be the basis for the sciences of man, grouped together by him as historical science, has, 17 Das Kapital, 13 Ch. 1. "The Development of Machinery." "Mathematicians and engineers - and one finds this echoed here and there by some English economists - declare the tool to be a simple machine and the machine to be a composite tool. They do not see any essential difference here and even call the simple mechanical powers, like the lever, the inclined plane, the screw, the wedge, etc., machines. Every machine is in fact composed of these simple powers, however disguised and combined. Yet from th economic point of view the explanation is invalid, because the historical element is missing from it" (my italics). This is no doubt an important point of view. Marx's criticism nevertheless is directed against an existing and generally accepted tradition of distinguishing only between simple and composite machines. Cf. Walch, Philoso- phische Lexicon, s.v. 'Maschinerie,' and note 2 on p. 189 of this article.</page><page sequence="14">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 73 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE as criterion of the level on which one moves and of the stage one has reached, joined the criterion of being able to predict the phenomena in the very physical sciences Vico thought he could set the axiom against. Exact formulation is the condition for it. With this new pos- sibilities of application have fallen to the lot of mathematics and logic. The history of European thought could be written in the light of the distinction, made by the Greeks, between nature (phusis) and art technoe), as the basic ideas in the explanation of reality. As every- where else the Greeks too wondered about the origin and source of what exists, and they took what they made themselves as their point of departure. More than elsewhere the element of knowledge prepon- derates with them and since then in the concept of techno: mathe- matics and logic figure prominently from the start in the understand- ing of the world. Making is a matter of art, of knowing the rules, of order. Nature introduces us to an order which we only get to know by observation, but which we do not make ourselves; in the case of human activities and products, on the other hand, we have to do with an order that is made by reason itself through contemplation (Tho- mas Aquinas). For the latter order man takes nature as his model, standard, and measure: natura artis magistra. The human product is a tool, a machine, a self-regulating mechanism, an electronic auto- maton. In the world of the gods Hephaistos already avails himself of automata, the 'little table, spread thyself' is possible there and is the realization of a daydream. With Aristotle the slaves are the automata; with Descartes the living beings and the human body; in our time, it is thought that the brain can be understood and explained as an auto- maton, the mechanism of which is still largely unknown to us. In this way the performance of the human mind would be amen- able to scientific explanation and understanding: the products of the computer sciences are here also the decisive proof; the simulation by electronic machines is supposed to warrant the assumption that human beings are nothing other than very complex machines. From this ability to imitate some processes and the fact that the identity of man and machine has now in outline and partially been proved, a complete identity is being extrapolated. The discussion and the in- quiry that used to take place about the universe is now shifting and at the same time being repeated with respect to man himself on his journey towards self-knowledge. Against the explanation of the uni- verse as a machine, 'the world-machine,' 'moles et machine mundi'</page><page sequence="15">74 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH (Lucretius) was set the teleological explanation of Plato and Aris- totle and after, which assumed a meaning-infusing principle trans- cendent to nature, or a meaning-determining principle immanent in nature. The latter is equally based on an analogy with human pro- ducts: against a merely mechanical process is set an intentional mod- el: nature as artifact. The discussion and the inquiry have, as I have just said, shifted to man himself. It is now no longer a matter of the philosophical leveling of man and machine in the framework of the metaphysical position of materialism as in the 18th century, but of an anticipation and continuation of the tendency which manifests itself in that level- ing, in which at present numerous specialized sciences, from mathe- matics and logic to biology in general, more especially cell theory, the investigation of heredity, neurophysiology of the brain, and also psy- chology and linguistics are involved interdepartmentally.'8 Through information theory the concept of language has been extended to any form or way of coding and transferring of information; interpreta- tion to any form of decoding and transposition from one code into another. Human language is here subordinated to a code of information in general and is itself reduced to an 'it-language.' In a recent article Norman Malcolm gave a penetrating analysis of the paradoxes to which a comprehensive neurophysiological the- ory of the mechanism of human action would give rise. Not only would we have to give up using expressions such as intentionally, un- intentionally, purposely and by mistake, but we should not even be warranted in saying that a person meant something by the sound emitted from him. No language would be possible. The first paradox would be that such a doctrine would be neither comprehensible nor conceivable because the occurrence of an act of asserting mechanicism is inconsistent with the truth of mechanicism. The second one is the asserting of mechanicism implies that the one making the assertion cannot be making it on rational grounds. In order to avoid these paradoxes one must deny that the princi- ple of mechanicism is universally true: one can hold that it is true 18 In Theories of the Mind, Jordan Scher (ed.), New York, 1962, one finds a rich diversity in the contributions from the various sciences associated with this subject. The two points of view in the matter of the relation between man and machine are clearly displayed, on the one side, especially in the articles by Percival Bailey, "Cortex and Mind," and by W. R. Ashby, "What is Mind?," and, on the other side, in that by Errol E. Harris, "Mind and Mechanical Models" (pp. 464-490), in which an array of arguments against the identification of mind with mechanical model is put forward.</page><page sequence="16">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 75 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE for others, but not for oneself. Therefore one would need to be able to maintain that mechanicism is a complete theory, to take it to hold good for others and would so be required to accept solipsism, which is in no way the intention, nor can it be. Should the comprehensive neurophysiological theory of human behavior be confirmed by scientific research or to quote Popper's words, be impossible to refute, then the paradoxes just mentioned would arise.' The verdict: 'man is a machine' can hardly be taken to mean any- thing else than that man is in principle able, on the basis of a com- prehensive theoretical plan, to make a duplicate of himself. That would be decisive proof of the relation between understanding and making with respect to man himself. The machine is after all a product of man's theoretical and practical ability and stands in each case for the level of self-knowledge attained. Exhaustive self- knowledge embodied in the machine would also have to take in the performance, the ingenuity, and the practical achievement of the engineer. The least that is required for this is that the para- doxes, made explicit by Norman Malcolm, be solved. If man is nothing but a machine, then this applies equally to the position of the scientific investigator and the designer. The humanizing of the machine as the converse of the postulate that man is a machine is, in other words, a program the carrying out of which depends on theo- retical self-knowledge. Nothing is easier than to ascertain that there. is still a long way to go. It is even extremely doubtful whether the stage will ever be reached where the machine will cease to be ma- chine and will have become man. Conscientious opposition, challeng- ing the foundations of the whole undertaking with which by this time a great number of specialized sciences are connected interdepart- mentally, would be bound to result in a censorship and a'ban on the whole of modern science, empirical science in particular, and on technical science. Leveling fundamental criticism, expressing critical reservations, and raising critical objections to certain more compre- hensive theories and their consequences are another matter. Also be- longing to the latter are, it would seem, Malcolm's above-mentioned 19 Norman Malcolm, "The Conceivability of Mechanism," The Philosophical Review, vol. LXXVII, no. 1. 1968, pp. 45-72.

This connection is to be found in the awakening realization, particularly in classical-modern thought that man is a historical-cultural being making his own his- tory. This fact of making oneself supposedly confers a priority to the sciences that deal with what is self-made. This was played against physical science, because nature, taken in the broadest sense, the uni- verse, comprising inanimate and animate nature, the human body, the nervous system, the brain, has not been made by man himself and can, for that reason, never be fully understood. Yet it appears that from the outset that physical science has al- lowed itself to be guided by the idea of making models, and particu- larly by the primordial model of the machine, towards the simula- tion and understanding of the processes in nature. The laboratories and the technological apparatus derive their ori- gin from this very relation between understanding and making, in which theory goes hand in hand with the setting up of all the condi- tions for making the simulation and reproduction of phenomena pos- sible. All the sciences that deal with man as a historic-cultural being nonetheless confine themselves to interpretation, reconstruction, and critical evaluation of what has been historically created. As a historic undertaking science is part of this. It does not occur to anybody to want to derive the works of Homer and Shakespeare, of Plato and Kant, Beethoven and Debussy, Euclid and Newton from a theoretical conception and, as it were, make them afresh. This applies to the theory of language as well. The initiative to design translating ma- chines, let alone to devise the formal language of the machines, did not come from the linguists, but from mathematicians and logicians working together with engineers, with possibly some linguists 'collab- orating.' This is characteristic of the situation in which the theory of language and linguistics finds itself today: a confrontation and con- flict of a method of investigation and a technique aimed at what has been historically and culturally achieved and created in all its multi- plicity and factual historical actuality, on the one hand, with the method of mathematicians and logicians, who with their natural bent towards rational and exact thought aim at what is theoretically con- ceivable and practically-technically feasible, on the other. Considered 20 See also K. R. Popper, "Language and the Body-Mind Problem," 4, "The Machine Argument," Conjectures and Refutations, 1963, p. 296 f.</page><page sequence="18">THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWING AND MAKING 77 AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE in a wider context: the encounter of cybernetics, with the understand- ing of man as a historicocultural being which prevails there, and the totally different aims it pursues: on the one side the desire for theo- retical understanding which aims at the ability to manipulate, on the other side the desire for understanding and critical evaluation of what has been historically achieved and created. This case shows, as clearly as possible, that when two people are saying the same thing, this does not necessarily mean that they are also referring to the same thing, when they say that understanding and making one- self tally exactly. In all this the idea of a model is operative, which is designed in virtue of a theory and simulates a process under specified conditions. The (artificial) synthesis of compounds as at least equivalent to the natural compound constitutes proof of the fact that one is physically and chemically, that is theoretically, conversant with these natural compounds. In this case as well, the ability to make oneself has proved to be, as it were, the acid test. Brought to bear on cell biology, genetics, neurology, brain func- tion, and electronic computers, this theory and doctrine not only bridged the division between the sciences, but, as the development of theory and technology turned the postulate of the hoomo ex machine into a scientifically and technologically attainable and workable prin- ciple, they also gave a fresh impulse to 18th century materialism. The debate about isomorphism and the ontological identity between man and machine, accompanying that development, points to the fact that the interpretation of the relation between archetype and model comes up against all kinds of objections and difficulties. I brought up only one of these, namely, the resulting paradoxes. The contrasts between what in German philosophy of science are usually called the science method and the arts method have in any case been brought out in fuller relief. Whereas Vico congratulated himself that philology, in close relation with philosophy as the sci- ence of reason, has a subject matter that can be more easily under- stood, because unlike nature it has been created by man himself, it is precisely the most recent development which raises the question whether or not this has been an illusion and a self-delusion or at any rate a premature and historically superseded theory. Vico applied af- ter all the principle that the true is the made, that the relation be- tween verum and factum is a two-way one, at the expense of physical science in favor of the historic world made by man. In the latter the requirement that one does not know a thing until one has been able</page><page sequence="19">78 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH to produce it has already ipso facto been satisfied. What man has wrought can in whatever form or at whatever level it may have been accomplished best be designated by one term, namely 'culture.' Taken in this way the concept of what has already been made is always a historical one. So is language. Man as a historicocultural being is the theme of this concept, which also includes science and technical sci- ence as products of history. With this conception goes accordingly an attitude of explanation and understanding. This attitude does not attempt to make once more anew what has already been made, but it tries to understand the latter as to its meaning and purpose, as to its origin, develop- ment, and presuppositions. This type of understanding can be linked with the critical question about its validity and value. This under- standing is always a re-creation, a reconstruction, but never a matter of constructing oneself and making oneself. As a historicizing concep- tion of the sciences of man and man's culture this understanding can play an important though no longer an exclusive part in the program implicit in Hegel's statements: "The Mind is the free," and "The Mind makes Itself." Only by a complementary relation of the theore- tical and historical understanding of himself and reality, which is his- torically given, can man fully realize himself and through this under- standing at the same time expand and consolidate his freedom.2" K.
