<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER MAKUCK Outside, Inside A FEW YEARS AGO I LISTENED TO A LECTURE about place in contempo rary poetry, assertions about how an identifiable "somewhere" is absent in the work of women poets, how inner geography is more important to them than outer. Winner of this year's L. E. Phillabaum Poetry Award for Slantwise, her sixth book,' Betty Adcock would likely disagree with such facile theory. She grew up in San Augustine, Texas, an isolated farming community sharply detailed in her poetry. Intervale, her previ ous volume, begins with the description of a black-and-white photo graph of herself, a six-year-old girl in a tree swing. Then the town beyond the picture comes to life in full color, re-imagined, on the day of her mother's funeral. Such a devastating early loss and the eventual move from a region that helped polish her lens on the world have generated some of her best work. Slantwise begins with "Little Text" (subtitled "East Texas"), a return to forests of longleaf pine, haunts of cougar, wild hogs, possum, armadillo, where "memory breathes its midge-cloud," and the world "could shine the way / scripture shines . . ." Adcock writes out of a deep need to reconnect with that first home: "I may have come for just this, / so long gone I can't remember bare / footlogs across the gar-infested creeks." While recognizing that memories fade, are unique and not easily shared, and acknowledging other woes of our predicament, she con cludes another poem with an affirming impulse toward belief: ... we rise to occasion almost reprieved, the way weed-strangled fields rise in colors of October fire, in the one celebration we're given: to dance, to sing anyhow, to grieve. "Dancers" Death, impermanence, and world-loss are central themes in Adcock's work, but she repeatedly says no to the negatives by calling attention to the sacred dimensions of art, music, and poetry that reflect moments of 1 SLANTWISE, by Betty Adcock.

Not limited to the Texas outback, she quickly makes you care about a tree removal worker, a carnival roustabout, a quilt maker, the Greek island of Sifnos, house cats, ditch lilies, and Paul de Man. The last earns satirical scorn. She describes how at war's end, this deconstructionist "turned his tail and ran" from Europe, finding a new home at Yale: What else could the man who wrote for Nazis do but cut the throat of meaning everywhere and render language an illegal tender? Adcock has a terrific sense of humor that she turns on herself to great effect in "Names": "How awful / to be Betty, all aprons and frosting mix, / thirties cartoons, fifties pinups ... / It's a name for a waitress, a bowler, a clerk / in a store ... // It is never, ever, the name of a poet." But Betty she is, saying she wouldn't want to be Plath or Sexton or a certain kind of professor: "Wouldn't I rather roll a strike at a bowling alley / than bowl them over in the faculty lounge with theory?" Poets can learn much from their earlier efforts, and Adcock retrieves "Three Dated Love Poems Found in a Drawer," puts them on display, then says: Never trust the early work. These poems duck the issues, run every which way away with themselves, regarding their own images ... Let's take them back to their beginnings, check into a motel somewhere, tell them to take off their clothes. Her inner geography has always been mapped by the outer. "Kind of Blue" reflects the movement of a pilgrim soul and takes place by her backyard pond. Its title coming from the classic Miles Davis album, the poem is triggered by a great blue heron, wings "like a riff of twilight" of which he is a part, blue being a heaviness becoming longing. He answers our shallows with transfiguring attention, a bent listening that is itself a singing. Mary Oliver is also ajoyful observer of the natural world and sees it in</page><page sequence="3">PETER MAKUCK 555 religious terms. The epigraph for this new volume,2 her thirteenth, is from Vincent van Gogh: "But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things." Oliver's world is at the tip of Cape Cod where the Atlantic sports "thousands of white hats / in the chop of the storm" ("Ocean"). Also figuring into poems are sand dunes, foxes, oaks, a dog, a black swallowtail, a crow. One of her best is the title poem, "Red Bird": Red bird came all winter firing up the landscape as nothing else could. Of course I love the sparrows, those dun-colored darlings, so hungry and so many. I am a God-fearing feeder of birds. I know He has many children, not all of them bold in spirit. Still, for whatever reason perhaps because the winter is so long and the sky so black-blue, or perhaps because the heart narrows as often as it opens I am grateful that red bird comes all winter firing up the landscape as nothing else can do. A seeker after divinity, Oliver reiterates the idea that it is heaven itself to accept the ordinary, that the natural world teaches, helps one toward enlightened awareness. With little in the way of figurative language, her poems are celebratory plainsongs. Plainness, however, becomes a problem. Unlike Adcock's poetry of lush detail and fine cadence or Oliver's own earlier work that was characterized by color, imagery, and indirection, many of these new poems tend to be general, touched by anthropomorphic and senti mental excesses-talking foxes, dogs, and birds. Oliver tells the truth but is no longer inclined to tell it slant. We get flat statement instead, as in "Someday": "I am sorry for every mistake I have made in my life. / I'm sorry I wasn't wise sooner. / I'm sorry I ever spoke of myself as lonely."

Here is most of the "End of Empire": We will be known as a culture that feared death and adored power, that tried to vanquish insecurity for the few and cared little for the penury of the many. We will be known as a culture that taught and rewarded the amassing of things, that spoke little if at all about the quality of life for people (other people), for dogs, for rivers. All the world, in our eyes, they will say, was a commodity ... Reading this prosaic editorial (albeit it one I agree with), I'm reminded of John Ciardi's durable observation about such statements. "Art," he wrote, "is of the nimbleness of the mind and will not be packsaddled by such gross weights of certainty." Readers like me who have been fond of Mary Oliver's work will likely be disappointed by her new direction. In his eighth book,3 Michael Chitwood interests himself in rural Virginia and easily holds our attention with subjects like snow, deer, buzzards, wisteria, or a snapping turtle. His poem "Flight," about a father rescuing his son from a charging bull, is unforgettable. Another poem voices concern about greedy development that eats up woodland at the expense of wild animals. "Neighbors" shows how fawns get injured and slowly die: "Our growling pack-Hondas, Volvos, Jeeps- / bring down a few, like this one, / starved or exhausted by injury." Then buzzards show up in backyard trees, "like a panel ofjudges." But Chitwood's quarrel is really with God. Effectively using an eccle siastical vocabulary (vespers, soul, Exodus, Holy Ghost, angels, etc.), his poems struggle with belief and unbelief, question a God indifferent to human suffering. Here is the opener of "Blue Sky," the book's first poem: "Everyone he knew believed in God." Chitwood then describes a car wreck in which "three people got where they hadn't intended to go, / one a little girl. . ." The accident leads him to question and doubt, but the programmatic response of believers to this tragedy and the impas sive blue sky is firm: "Because we make mistakes doesn't mean God does." And "Spill" has the speaker visit a dying friend who is attached to an IV pole; here he finds himself witness to belief he is no longer capable of: "His very marrow has failed him, / but he never questions his God. . ." Chitwood probably envies his friend's faith but in another poem writes with wicked humor about a guy who gets baptized drunk and wakes up hung over the next day, remembering scarcely a thing.

Their brakes cry out to You. Hear them, 0 Lord. Drive out the demons from their steering column and come in to the transmission that they may know the peace of passing. Minister even unto the turn indicator. Creator Spirit, Holy Maker of the Universe, give them gas. Many of his poems find revelation not in scripture but in the details of green creation where the kingdom is glimpsed again and again. Among the pleasures of his work are the wonderfully precise and evocative descriptions of winter fields, the hum of bees, dragonflies, the music of a swollen creek, or a snow angel made by his daughter: For a while it hovered perfect as a hummingbird outside the window, then her brother's friends slogged through, and a dog. It grew grimy with seeds from the bird feeder and finally started to evolve, the wings melting back toward the shoulder blades, the earth in spots rising through the form. She forgot it, but I watched it become not something to be praised or feared but a creature, gritty, rimed, in places glinting. "Annunciation." Chitwood's theological doubts give the volume a fine unity, but the last poem, "Afternoons in October," is mysteriously haunting and suggests there might well be another world that thinly eludes us. He describes a numinous presence in the woods, faint footfalls, "a little louder than the sound of snowflakes" on fallen leaves, as if he is being watched: I would like to catch a glimpse, but somehow know I won't. It moves whether I move or not, its progress not unlike mine, but more sure, more present, being just where it needs to be. Even if it weren't winner of the A. Poulin, Jr. Poetry Prize, The Boatloads would still be an impressive debut.4 Dan Albergotti doesn't find sanctuary in the world of flora and fauna as do the above writers in this review.

When Albergotti in another poem observes an osprey buckle its wings, plummet, and labor aloft with a "twisting burden," he is again reminded of death, its constant workings: "We are caught, / hooked in the eye by unseen talons, waiting for dark." Or when we read a title like "The Mystery of the Great Blue Heron," our expectations implode in the first lines: "The poet tries to make the heron a god, / but the heron does not care." Decidedly anti-transcendental, Albergotti is more of an indoor writer, his regional "somewhere" a bit vague. Place, however, is very important in the book's prefatory offering, "Vestibule," in which the speaker recalls how he and his girlfriend sneaked into the "university chapel / late one night in 1983 to make love." This extraordinary poem, at first comic and blasphemous, is really about relocating and redefining the sacred: we lay below the altar and preached a quiet sermon notjust on the divinity of skin, but on the grace of the heart beneath. It was the only homily we knew, and our souls were beatified. If you say sentiment and cliche, then that is what you say. What I know is what is sacred. Lord of this other world, let me recall that night. In his excellent Foreword, Edward Hirsch says that Albergotti longs for a world beyond the self, "is a restless searcher who keeps bumping up against the void." The void, of course, has been created by a Deus absconditus nonetheless addressed, even prayed to. Echoing in various poems the faith and doubt, hope and despair we find in the Psalms, Albergotti also exercises his anger using other Biblical stories. Aspects of Genesis and the Flood are retold in skeptical, deflating ways. "Book of the Father" indicts, in part, religious fanaticism: 'Yeah Abraham / ... everywhere always. In the tank with Ariel Sharon, / in the studio with Jerry Falwell, in the cockpit with Mohammed / Atta." In a fine persona poem, "Testimony," Cain makes a case for himself and refuses guilt: "I was just being the rough beast the Lord had made." If Albergotti finds no assurance of a Creator in glories of the natural world, he is even less assured when he looks around at rough beasts, aka human beings. Though the title is a throwaway, "Song 246" is unrelent ingly chilling: What song could be in the filthy basement where the small boy is chained to a beam his mouth gagged with an athletic sock? What song there on this third morning</page><page sequence="7">PETER MAKUCK 559 while his parents keep putting posters of his face on light poles through the city? What song could the man sing, the man who lives upstairs, who comes down four times each day with enough water to sustain life, lubricant, and a worn barber's strap? As the poem continues its litany of cruel sounds, we recall Ivan Karamazov's God-denying arguments to Alyosha-one illustrated by the story of a landowner who sics his hunting dogs on an innocent little boy and watches him torn to pieces. But even without the consolation of belief, Albergotti is grateful for beauty and small pleasures, for being alive. In one poem, he remembers a horrific car wreck, recognizes the chancy nature of existence, and lists accidents that might easily have put him on Charon's ferry. He is good at litany, and one of his best is "Among the Things He Does Not Deserve": Greek olives in oil, fine beer, the respect of colleagues, the rapt attention of an audience, pressed white shirts, just one last-second victory, sympathy, buttons made to resemble pearls, a pale daughter, living wages, a father with Italian blood, pity ... The attractive jacket photo on James Harms's After West,5 his sixth book, is nicely thematic and shows a 1957 Ford station wagon on an empty high desert road with a small white camper in tow. The camper is a visual echo of one of the lonely migrating clouds. Along with Walt Whitman's epigraph about long wandering, facing home, and not having found what he was looking for, this photo establishes the volume's themes of pilgrim beauty, vulnerability, and change. Louis Simpson, thinking of Whitman, famously wrote: "The land is within. / At the end of the open road, we come to ourselves." Harms takes it from there. In his ambitious long title poem, "After West," he shows the despair and wasteland aftermath of westward expansion and also how the journey continues. Some of his poems, like "My Dream of Bob Marley," journey surrealistically inward, while others move outward with imagistic exactitude. The "West" of Harms's title refers to southern California where he grew up but also to his home in West Virginia. When I lived in Wheeling the mid-'70s, one of the rueful, self-lacerating jokes was that the state was owned by Pittsburgh. That perception apparently remains: 5AFTER WEST, byJames Harms.

"Of Beauty and West Virginia at the Blue Moose Cafe" Harms looks at the effects of industrial devastation in other poems which describe the sick color of the silted "working river," the smell of chemicals and smoke, the coal barges and dumps, ash-colored ware houses and vacant lots, slag heaps, and the lunar surfaces of strip-mined mountains, their tops removed. Especially poignant is the widespread poverty and homes with "wooden / porches and stairways [that] lean wildly and crumble, concealing nothing / at last but neglect's abandoned / concealment" ("Like Mercury, the Monongahela"). But After West implies a before, or a prelapsarian world that we glimpse in several gripping memory poems or in poems featuring his children, Walt and Phoebe, where redemptive innocence radiates outward. "Landscapes as the Latest Diet (Southern California)," though partly satirical, contemplates hunger and memory while it beautifully describes Balboa Pier, "masts blending the mist," date palms and sage, the smell of oranges and smudge pots, or "the song of bells / in the harbor, the seals draped / over buoys like fat uncles on the furniture." Another poem, "A Friday at the End of August," has the speaker visiting his mother near an almond orchard, sitting in an oleander's blue shade with options of a swim or a "glass of good Modesto wine," Mexican workers making "border music, the psalm of evening." Though After West opens with "Pisgah Church Cemetery" and its growing metaphori cal shadows, at the end of the poem the speaker emphasizes a hallowed present, always available: "Let's let tomorrow take care of tomorrow." Often stoic but with buoyant moments, James Harms's book contains exceptional poems about architect Frank Gehry, the Sinatra generation, outer space, gravity, and Western landscape painter Edgar Alwin Payne. Jean Cocteau is reputed to have said that a true poet sings from his family tree. So it is with Jane Shore, whose fifth book6 features on its jacket the photo of an old-fashioned shirtwaist, translucently white, apparitional, weightless-a perfect image for poems haunted by the ghosts of family members gone. Shore easily draws a reader into narratives, often humorous, about her daughter, parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts. With the exception of "September 9, 1995," a vivid poem about an autumn walk down a country dirt road, "leaves like brushfires / spilling along the branches," most of Shore's settings are 6AWYES-OR-NO ANSWER, byJane Shore.

Like other poets in this review, she deals with death, but its sting is somehow mitigated by memory and the enduring presence of loved ones who mysteriously reappear. In "The Closet," with no melodramatic set up, the speaker's mother is simply back, humorously there: For once, my mother doesn't talk. She bears no message fromJewish heaven where the dead have nothing to do all day but sit around and advise the living. More like the Ten Commandments: Never wear white in winter or velvet in summer. Buy life insurance. File a will. In other poems she must deal with inherited possessions-her mother's chair and nightgowns, her father's cufflinks and piano. Shore poignantly reminds us how objects can reassuringly suffuse a room with the palpable presence of their owners. But there are disturbing presences as well. "Fugue" tells of an attentive mother who has been housesitting with her young son while the speaker is away. Neighbors remember them as normal and friendly, but one day the mother kills her son and slits her wrists, leaving "bloody floorboards / where their two dead bodies lay." The speaker replaced and "stained the new boards to match / the old ones," but the latent image of a dead mother and her little boy remain wrenchingly indelible. A few of Shore's uncles and aunts are not exactly cherished. "Rattlesnake" understatedly tells of spending a few nights with a crazy aunt who ladles onto the little girl's plate something "bony / along the spine, fishy white flesh / threaded with gray spider-veins / like the veins webbing Aunt Sadie's pale thighs." Because she refuses to eat, Aunt Sadie lops off her ponytail with "kitchen shears," makes her scoop it from the floor, and throw it into the trash. By contrast, "Unforgettable" details a beloved aunt's increasing dementia until the speaker finally assumes the painful responsibility of moving her into an assisted living facility. One of Shore's liveliest inventions, "My Mother's Foot," shows how we inherit more than furniture from our parents. Noticing hammer toes, she wonders how her mother's foot became part of her: I thought I'd buried it years ago with the rest of her body, next to my father in Cedar Park Cemetery. How did it ever track me down ... ?

Though Shore has titles like "God's Breath," "Scrabble in Heaven," and "Body and Soul," her poems exhibit no quarrel with God nor an urgency to know the unknowable, as do those of Chitwood and Albergotti. The volume's last poem is a beauty on the subject of hunger and doubt. "Gelato" begins with a close look at a Caravaggio in the National Gallery, a painting which focuses on St. Thomas putting his finger into the spear wound of the resurrected Christ. The speaker says, ".... it's our natures to doubt, / I'd doubt what I was seeing, too." The second part of this delicious poem has the speaker and friend hurry from the museum, "the past, that open wound" to a vendor of Italian gelato, that "soothing cooling balm": ... tiramisut, zabaglione, zuppa inglese, milky breasts, whipped, rippled peach and mango, pistachio, vanilla flecked with brown dizzying splinters of bean, coffee, caramel, hazelnut, stracciatella, raspberry, orange, chocolate, chocolate mint .... Balm indeed, and a full-flavored closure as well.</page></plain_text>
