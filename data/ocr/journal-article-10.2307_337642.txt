<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTHIC UNITY IN LORCA'S CAMBORIO POEMS BEVERLY J. DE LONG California State College at Long Beach FEW READERS would take issue with the judgment that Federico Garcia Lorca's poetic conception of the gypsy in the Romancero gitano and the Poema del cante jondo clearly exalts this enigmatic wanderer. In the view of several critics, this exaltation variously fixes itself upon the innocence and dignity of the gypsies (Edwin Honig), their instinctive aris- tocracy (Guillermo Diaz-Plaja), their im- pulse toward integration, to be themselves (Juan L6pez-Morillas), their passion and imagination (C. M. Bowra), their spirit of opposing life to death (Christoph Eich); and to those qualities could be added beauty, grace and commitment to an ethical code.' Yet, some observers have found an apparent exception to this laudatory treat- ment in the presentation of Antonio Torres Heredia in "Prendimiento de Antoflito el Camborio en el camino de Sevilla," the first of two back-to-back Camborio poems in the Romancero gitano. Still other critics have for their special reasons preferred to con- centrate their commentary on the second poem, "Muerte de Antofiito el Camborio." In our view, those who see in Antonio's earlier behavior only a "grave dereliction of honour" as Bowra terms it (p. 208), and those who are concerned only with the youth's manner of dying in the second poem, overlook the basic unity of the two ballads, a unity provided by a systematic structure of contradictions presided over by a strong mythic impulse. Lorca himself once explicitly identified Antonio as the prototype of the true gypsy and on at least one other occasion enunci- ated his mythic intent in the Romancero gitano.2 Of the several critics who have noted the presence of myth in Lorca, how- ever, most limit themselves to either mere mention of specific allusions to traditional mythology or to undeveloped statements about the mythic inspiration of the poems. Bowra, for instance, sees in the presence of the civil guard the ground upon which a mythic struggle occurs "between passionate, imaginative, simple life and the cruel, un- natural forces of senseless authority which attack it" (p. 201). Pedro Salinas attributes the presence of myth in Lorca's work to his metaphoric capacity to convert the natural world into an orb populated by supernatural forces and beings.3 Diaz-Plaja also notes that "las fuerzas oscuras" pre- dominate in eight of the eighteen ballads comprising the Romnancero gitano, though he does not specifically attribute to them a mythic portent and notably categorizes the Camborio poems as belonging to another group, "mundo real" (p. 124). Angel del Rio earlier had commented that Lorca elevates a small gypsy universe to the cate- gory of a mythic hierarchy,4 and Ricardo Gull6n characterizes Lorca as the con- temporary poet "mas inclinado a la tras- posici6n mitica."5 In a somewhat more analytical vein, L6pez-Morillas has eluci- dated the "lyrical primitivism" of the bal- lads, seeing in their violence the founda- tion for Lorca's dramatization of "the con- flict between primitive myth and modern ideas" (p. 134). It is, however, Gustavo Correa who has given us the most systematic and thorough study of the over-all mythic structure of six principal works by Lorca: Poenza del cante jondo, Romancero gitano, Bodas de sangre, Yerma, Llanto por Ignacio Sdnchez Mejias, and Poeta en Nueva York.6 In the process, Correa isolates several characteris- tics which contribute to the mythic unity of the six works: (1) the feeling of con- tinuity between man and nature and his total immersion in the cosmos (p. 156), as seen in the poet's metaphoric treatment of the drbol and flor categories, (2) the tend- 840</page><page sequence="2">MYTHIC UNITY IN LORCA's CAMBORIO POEMS 841 ency toward anthropomorphism of the en- tire organic and inorganic world (p. 157), as seen in the lustful viento of "Preciosa y el aire'" (3) endowment of real and objec- tive qualities to mere attributes of sub- stances (p. 158), as in the famous verde of "Romance sonaimbulo," (4) a cause-and- effect category which attempts mythically to explain natural phenomena (p. 159), for example the death of the boy in "Ro- mance de la luna, luna," (5) ritualism (p. 160), as in the death and return cycle of nature themes in Bodas de sangre and Yerma, (6) presence of archetypal figures (p. 162) like Novio, Novia, and Madre of Bodas de sangre, (7) tendency toward "synthetic" metaphor rather than analytic (p. 172), (8) the impulse toward fable in which personages penetrate primordial worlds removed from the prosaic world of our own events (p. 173), as do Preciosa, Soledad Montoya and Ignacio, and (9) a contemplation of human life, in Lorca's work destined to be surprised and abruptly cut short in the rhythmic process of its own realization (p. 174). In view of Correa's penetrating conclu- sions about the over-all structure of Lorca's work, it comes as somewhat of a surprise that his reading of the Camborio poems hinges on an interpretation which attributes to Antonio's death an anti-mythic character derived from the instrumental role of civil guards who are not even present during the gypsy's mortal struggle: "'Muerte de Antofiito el Camborio' (. . .) es la muerte anti-mitica que sigue a su prendimiento dada por los guardias civiles que dejan caer sobre el gitano 'tres golpes de sangre.' El gitano, que trata de defenderse de los tricornios, se perfila ahora en toda la suges- tividad de una figura mitica . . ." (p. 41). On the contrary, it seems evident that the contrastive technique here demonstrated by the presence of the civil guards in the first poem and their absence in Antoflito's fatal encounter with his own gypsy cousins con- stitutes a direct corollary of the mythic unity of the two ballads. Claude LIvi- Strauss has pointed out, in his structural analysis of myth, that "mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution."'7 This same system is evident in nearly all the mythic categories in Lorca's two poems and is of supreme import to their unity. The first category, the man-nature con- tinuum, is probably the most obvious fea- ture of the mythic impulse. Not to be con- fused with the romantic link between the individual and nature, whereby man "tends to make of nature the mere plaything of his mood,"s the mythic continuum revolves about the relationship between cosmic forces and mankind and is "a recognition of natural conflicts, of human desire frus- trated by non-human powers, hostile op- pression, or contrary desires; it is a story of the birth, passion, and defeat by death which is man's common fate."9 Scientific thought, on the contrary, views nature through a system of classification and dif- ferentiation which divides life into sharply defined provinces of plants, animals, man. But those boundaries do not exist for primi- tive thought, where life is felt to be an "unbroken continuous whole" and "the limits between the different spheres are not insurmountable barriers; they are fluent and fluctuating."'1 In the two Lorca bal- lads, this intimate and fluctuating relation- ship is demonstrated first in a retreat from Antonio's submission and incarceration "mientras el cielo reluce / como la grupa de un potro" and ultimately in nature's sympathetic approval of his fatal encounter as "un angel marchoso pone / su cabeza en un cojin. / Otros de rubor cansado, / encendieron un candil." In "Prendimiento ." the entire cosmos is moved to shun the vision of Antonio's confinement and his relinquishing of the "vara de mimbre," symbol of his aristocracy and vitality which acquires in its absence a further signifi- cance of liberty. Not only has the entire universe lamented his apprehension by the civil guards, but the basic speaker also articulates the anti-mythic result of his</page><page sequence="3">842 BEVERLY J. DE LONG capture by denying him his name, which in mythic thinking is indissolubly linked with a person's very self and personality: "Ni t-i eres hijo de nadie, / ni legitimo Camborio." As Cassirer points out, this connection is even recognized in more ad- vanced cultures, for under Roman law "a slave had no legal name, because he could not function as a legal person."" An- tofiito's capture, then, is felt to be an ab- dication of his ego, a surrender of his essence, both as a member of his tribe and in the larger context of his continuity with the non-human forces of the universe. This renunciation not only de-legitimizes An- tonio, but affects in similar fashion the ancestors who form an integral part of the nature-individual continuum: "Estain los viejos cuchillos / tiritando bajo el polvo." In the second poem, though, his struggle represents an active participation in answer to cosmic "voces de muerte," even though the concrete form of death comes at the hands of his cousins from Benameji. The presentation of the battle is perfectly en- closed within a framework provided by repetition of the lines "Voces de muerte sonaron / cerca del Guadalquivir," and it is only in the posterior dialogue between the dying Antonio and the basic speaker, "Federico Garcia," that the instruments of those voces are identified. In that same dialogue, Antonio is restored his family name, and consonant with that narrative recognition of filial reintegration, nature also reverses herself to acknowledge ad- miringly his death by preparing his body to lie in state. A correllative of this cosmic continuity is the anthropomorphic display of the two poems, again demonstrated in both negative and positive aspects, particularly in terms of the bullfight. The manner of nature's rejection of Antonio's comportment in the first poem is conveyed by an extended meta- phor which envisions the day as a bull- fighter engaged in a move designed to in- cite a new bull to charge: El dia se va despacio, la tarde colgada a un hombro, dando una larga torera sobre el mar y los arroyos. Sunset is presented here in terms of a bullfighting image, with the day in the role of torero and the evening as the capote de brega, the large circular silk cape, ma- genta-colored on one side and golden yel- low on the other, used in the early stages of the spectacle. Here the torero (day) has just performed a move known as the larga, a lance done with only one hand holding the cape in an attempt to provoke the bull. The cape is swung high into the air over the bullfighter's head, coming down on his shoulder and hanging down over his back as he turns away disdainfully from the bull. The image is spectacularly effective here, evoking with its concrete reference and its open vowels the colors, expanse and slow withdrawal of the sun-all in terms which recall the previous destination of Antofiito. All nature participates in this turning away, with plant life (aceitunas) looking forward to the darkness of the southern night, and the wind hurriedly abandoning the scene. This taurine metaphor will find its anti- thesis in the second poem, where the stars act as rejoneador, the mounted bullfighter who kills by placing rejones in the agua gris contiguously with Antonio's own trial by steel. (The rej6n is a shaft about three feet long tipped by a steel blade which measures between fourteen and nineteen inches in length.) Cuando las estrellas clavan rejones al agua gris, cuando los erales suefian ver6nicas de alheli, voces de muerte sonaron cerca del Guadalquivir. Even the erales, two-year-old bulls just old enough for open-field testing of their cour- age but still two years away from the bull- ring, share this blood, if only in dreams of ver6nicas, a face-to-face lance whereby the bull is encouraged to charge with head lowered and turn quickly for yet another charge. The vertnica de alheli suggests the yellow and red sides of the capote de brega, with its obvious implications of blood, as well as the tints of color in the aftermath</page><page sequence="4">MYTHIC UNITY IN LORCA'S CAMBORIO POEMS 843 of sunset when the stars first make their metallic appearance in the sky. The bull- fighting images reach their culmination in the narrator's concise, almost terse, summa- tion of the gypsy's death, "Tres golpes de sangre tuvo / y se muri6 de perfil," whereby Antonio assumes the stance of the bull- fighter sighting down the blade of the sword into the very eyes of death-the climactic moment of the bullfight, a mo- ment which has its own strict form and style. Particularly in these references to the bullfight do the poems demonstrate still another mythic conception-ritualism. Prob- ably in no aspect of Spanish culture, except the church, is ritual so faithfully observed as in the bullfight, with its clearly defined phases and territories, its symbolic content, and its formalized movements, gestures and audience reactions. Equally ritualistic is the poetic progression here from the larga torera to the fatal finale with its sacrificial overtones. Concomitant to that undeniably obvious ritual is the previously mentioned movement from Antonio's ancestral and tribal legitimacy through the denial of his Camborio name to his ultimate reintegra- tion. Even within that final phase, cere- monial proportions are evident: Un 6ingel marchoso pone su cabeza en un cojin. Otros de rubor cansado, encendieron un candil. Furthermore, the very narrative technique which Leo Spitzer has called the ticnica de rondeau12 is used here to perfection in the second poem and provides the perfect circle so fundamental to mythic conscious- ness as symbolic of the life cycle: Voces de muerte sonaron cerca del Guadalquivir. (struggle) Voces de muerte sonaron cerca del Guadalquivir. dialogue) recapitulation) (reactions) Voces de muerte cesaron cerca del Guadalquivir. It is these dark undefined voices which announce Antonio's sacrifice, assigning to the event an inscrutable cause entirely in keeping with its mysterious effect. Nor can Antofiito himself extract from his death any but an arcane explanation: "Lo que en otros no envidiaban, / ya lo envidiaban en mi." Despite the fact that he can iden- tify the hands which wield the fateful knives, it is the obscure chorus which pre- sides over the action and gives to death its coherent, albeit non-discursive, connection. "Myth and primitive religion are by no means entirely incoherent, they are not bereft of sense or reason," Cassirer points out in An essay on man (p. 81). "Primitive man by no means lacks the ability to grasp the empirical differences of things. But in his conception of nature and life all these differences are obliterated by a stronger feeling: the deep conviction of a funda- mental and indelible solidarity of life that bridges over the multiplicity and variety of its single forms .... The consanguinity of all forms of life seems to be a general pre- supposition of mythic thought" (p. 82); and that belief in the unity of life, we might add, affects the primitive concept of death in a manner which is particularly pertinent to a discussion of Lorca's treat- ment of death. "In primitive thought," Cas- sirer continues, "death is never regarded as a natural phenomenon that obeys general laws. Its occurrence is not necessary but accidental. It always depends upon indi- vidual and fortuitous causes. It is the work of witchcraft or magic or some other per- sonal inimical influence" (p. 83). Thus, the death of Antoflito el Camborio is justi- fied by a typically mythic connection and is circumscribed by those incomprehensible voces de muerte. In sharp contrast to that coherency, the basic speaker of the first poem provided only an abrupt juxtaposition of two dissimilar actions as a logical ground for the gypsy's apprehension: A la mitad del camino cort6 limones redondos, y los fue tirando al agua hasta que la puso de oro. Y a la mitad del camino, bajo las ramas de un olmo, guardia civil c aminera lo llev6 codo con codo.</page><page sequence="5">844 BEVERLY J. DE LONG The act of cutting limones in itself is in- significant as cause for Antonio's capture, but it is indicative rather of the mythic propensity toward metamorphosis, which Cassirer proposes as the law by which the mythic world is governed (Essay, p. 81). Antonio here occupies himself with trans- forming the appearance of one natural realm by means of another realm's external aspect (at the same time affirming the con- tinuity of all realms), not for practical ends but for esthetic results. It is that pre- occupation, not as action but as mode of being, which encounters its dialectic oppo- sition in the guardia civil, not as a historical body but as an anti-mythic mode of being. The two modes are mutually exclusive: in this case, the mythic gives way in the presence of the anti-mythic. In a striking parallel in the Poema del cante jondo, the reverse resolution is found, as a teniente coronel of the guardia civil falls dead after the following series of pronouncements by a gitano: "He inventado unas alas para volar, y vuelo. Azufre y rosas en mis labios. ... Y naranjas en la nieve." ("Escena del teniente coronel de la guardia civil," pp. 331-32) Mythic ideation in the later poem triumphs in the face of its contrary, as op- posed to the triumph of anti-mythic being here in 1928. Images and narrative technique in both Camborio poems bespeak of an archetypal configuration which is typical of mythic ideation. In "Prendimiento.. ." first the names and manner of presentation an- nounce the illustriousness of Antonio: "An- tonio Torres Heredia, / hijo y nieto de Camborios, / con una vara de mimbre / va a Sevilla a ver los toros." The genealogical formula, straight from the traditional ballad (and, at the same time, mythic in its im- plication of ancestor worship), presents the young gypsy as a figure every bit as regal as any of the heroes of old. (Those who lament the absence in Lorca's ballads of personages and themes of heroic propor- tions fail to appreciate the fact that the structural aspects of a work are as influ- ential as the anecdotal in establishing values.) The formulaic line "con una vara de mimbre" signifies his royalty and his vitality (and retrospectively his liberty), and the suggestion of heroic tradition is seconded by the line "moreno de verde luna," which assumes the proportions of a formula throughout the two poems. The abundance of traditional devices results in an immediate elevation of Antofiito to the potential stature of culture hero, but this presentation is abruptly interrupted and denied by the entrance of the civil guards and by cosmic and narrative abhorrence of Antonio's capture. This hiatus in the pres- entation of the hero will be terminated only in the second poem, where zoomorphic analogies enter to aid in the transformation of a culture hero into mythic hero. Antonio is likened during his struggle, for instance, to the jabali (famed for its savagery) and the delfin (noblest of sea creatures). Fur- thermore, in taurine references he is made to participate in the ancient and solemn ritual whereby man confronts death. In addition, the elevation to mythic hero is implied in the timeless nature of evocations of classical antiquity: zapatos color corinto, suggesting the nobility of the ancient rival of Athens and Sparta; digno de una Em- peratriz; and medallones de marfil, convert- ing the usual gypsy amulet into ivory medallions. The exaltation reaches its peak in the narrative assertion that this gypsy is a viva moneda que nunca / se volveri a repetir, a figure which unites Antonio with those emperors of the classical past whose image was struck on a medallion com- memorating their reign, with the mold then being broken to symbolize their singu- larity. Thus, Antoiiito el Camborio is trans- ported from his own historical moment and delivered into that temporal realm where past, present and future merge in a pri- mordial time. In addition to this archetypal mythic hero, however, we also have the prototype of the anti-mythic figure in the civil guards, previously mentioned as per- sonages who controvert Antonio's mythic realization. It should also be remembered</page><page sequence="6">MYTHIC UNITY IN LORCA'S CAMBORIO POEMS 845 that they significantly drink lemonade at Antonio's incarceration, thus symbolically perverting elements of nature for purely practical ends, in stark contrast to the meta- morphic and esthetic role of the limones in the hands of Antonio. In the mythic context of the two poems, then, the civil guards (whom the gypsy later calls in his agony merely to record his death) are anti- mythic figures who constitute a rupture in the man-nature continuum. It is not they who will be Antofiito's antagonists in the second poem, but rather his four Heredia cousins, whose presence permits the ele- vation of this mortal conflict to the category of a tribal and cosmic feud in which the young Camborio mythically represents all Camborios and ultimately all mankind. IT NOW SEEMS APPARENT that these two poems are unified by a system of con- trasts and antitheses within admittedly mythic categories. There is yet a final word to be said, however, about the ultimate vision of human existence therein pre- sented. Granted, these poems show no de- viation from most of Lorca's work, wherein youth in full flower is cut down by death. But these poems say also something about death itself, for life can be postulated only in the context of its contingency upon death. First of all, Antonio's capture in the first poem alienates him from the basic speaker, from his own personality, from his tribe and from the cosmos, yet he lives on. Paradoxically, the second poem presents his death, but it would seem to deny that death (the ultimate alienation for modern man) is capable of interrupting the continuity between man and nature. Quite the con- trary, it is in Antonio's death that his ful- fillment reaches its culmination. Death, then, is denied by this individual's total immersion in the universe, and in that conquest Antonio is accorded the position of mythic hero. Indeed, Cassirer has noted that "the whole of mythical thought may be interpreted as a constant and obstinate negation of the phenomena of death.... Primitive religion is perhaps the strongest and most energetic affirmation of life that we find in human culture" (Essay, p. 84). No less can be said for Lorca's poetry and drama.
