Rarely indeed do Egyptian texts give us any insight into the personalities of the Pharaohs. Contemporary descriptions of kings are of course quite useless in this respect, being but formal eulogies descriptive rather of a superhuman ideal of royalty than of any individual occupant of the throne. The records (as well as more concrete evidence) of royal activities within Egypt usually leave much scope for conjecture as to how much was due to the king's own initiative and how much to that of his advisers, or to the mere routine of state; and similarly, the military reputation which some kings have gained may rest chiefly upon the qualities of their generals. A few of the royal allocutions to subjects or to posterity (Sesostris II's Semnah stela, the text on the base of Hatshepsut's standing obelisk at Karnak, Sethos I's longer Redesiyah inscription) are engagingly fresh, the work of an original mind able to break through the tradition of stringing time-honoured phrases together; but how do we know that theputative authors uttered or even inspired the words there ascribed to the ? Even Akhenaten's personality is not disttinct; of the others, only in two or three cases is some trait left on record, such as Piankhy's hatred of cruelty to horses, and WahCankh Anotef's fondness of dogs. That we learn so little, either from their own times or from their posterity, as to what manner of men the Pharaohs were, accounts partly for the absence of human interest which is a notable feature of Egyptian political history. But on the character of Snefru, one of the greatest of the early monarchs, it is possible to say something of interest; for although we have no contemporary evidence thereon (his alleged incest with his daughter may or may not have been the outcome of an idiosyn- crasy), we obtain, if we look for them, clear glimpses of the light in which he was regarded by later generations. These indications are given us, not by historical documents, but by popular narratives which profess to tell us of happenings in Snefru's time. The following are the relevant passages: 1. The Prisse Papyrus preserves the latter part of a book of wise sayings which the vizier of Snefru's predecessor is stated to have written down for his children's benefit-the sayings being set in a framework of narrative. At the end we are told that King Tuni died; "then the Majesty of King Snefru was raised up' as beneficeat king in the whole land." The word rendered "beneficent" is mnh, in Ptolemaic times the equivalent of eVEp7yETr7S. 2. The work known as the Prophecies of Neferrehu begins: " Now it happened that the Majesty of the justified Snefru was beneficent king in the whole land." Here we have 1 Quite incidentally, the term "raised up" (ihA') seems to indicate that Snefru was the first of his dynasty.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON TWO EGYPTIAN KINGS the same epithet. In no other case known to me is it applied in this way to a deceased ruler: it can be no mere conventional honorific. 3. In the Westcar Papyrus it is recounted how one day Snefru, feeling rather jaded, refreshed mind and body by an outing on the palace lake. Suddenly one of the twenty pretty girls who were rowing him about dropped her jewel into the water. The Chief Magician is hastily summoned, and Snefru, addressing him as " Zazamc6nekh, my brother," tells him of the mishap, which is quickly set right by art magic. 4. The Prophecies of Neferrehu relate that Snefru, again seeking distraction from the cares of kingship, had his courtiers summoned, "and his Majesty said to them: 'Comrades', I have had you summoned that you may seek out for me...one who will tell me some good matter, choice discourse at hearing which my Majesty may be amused."' 5. The courtiers thereupon sing the praises of one Neferrehu; Snefru sends for him, and addresses the stranger thus: ( Come now, Neferrehu, my friend, tell me some good matter, choice discourse at hearing which my Majesty may be amused." 6. Neferrehu then asks whether he shall speak of what is happening or of what shall happen. " And his Majesty said: ' Of what shall happen, of course; the present has entered into existence and is being passed by.' Then he put forth his hand to a box of writing requisites, and took out papyrus and pen-and-ink case, and he wrote down what Neferrehu said." The first two passages quoted show that Snefru as a ruler was so highly esteemed in later times that he (and he alone) was normally referred to as the Beneficent King. I believe the words in italics in the other four passages to be intentional touches of literary characterization, the expression of a definite tradition as to Snefru's character. That a mighty Pharaoh should hail one of his officials as "my brother" (the yd dkhi of modern Egypt), his courtiers as "comrades" and a stranger as "my friend" is strikingly uncon- ventional; such words are put into no other king's mouth. Equally striking is the picture of a king so little bound by court etiquette that instead of calling in a secretary to take down memorable utterances he seizes pen and paper and does the work himself, an action that is again without parallel. The Pharaoh who is made to speak and act thus must have been remembered as eminently genial and "democratic" in his dealings with lower mortals. And, perhaps, as being fond of pleasure in intervals of public beneficence; for it is worthy of note that in both the tales in which he figures he is represented as seeking amusement. A great king with such a reputation could not but endear himself to posterity; and that this is the case we have substantial evidence. Of the cults of the Old Kingdom rulers, Snefru's was alone popular; we can trace it through history, in more than one city, down to Ptolemaic times, when it still flourished. And the number of places called after him, for many centuries after his death, testifies further to the honour in which he was held. How far the traditional estimate of Snefru's character was accurate is a question that we have no means of deciding; but it is difficult to believe that a conception in some ways so divergent from the Egyptian ideal of the god-king can have been quite baseless. Although popular tradition is not historical evidence, it is the next best thing. 1 For the meaning of the word rhw used here, compare its use by labourers and artizans (e.g., ERMAN, Reden, Rufe und Lieder, 15, 22, 23; SETHE, Urk. Iv, 1154. 5, 11), as the exact equivalent of our "mates." L 251</page><page sequence="3">252 BATTISCOMBE GUNN 2. The Name Tuteankhamiin. It seems to be assumed without question by Egyptologists, and therefore by the public, that the name of the Egyptian king who in recent years has achieved world-wide celebrity means " Living Image of Amun." This interpretation is, however, open to serious objection. We must remember that "Tut'ankhamfin" is an alteration, in the interests of the Amuinist reaction, from the earlier name "Tut"ankhaten," a name reflecting the pre- dominance of the exclusive Aten-worship instituted by Akhenaten. The change, like that in the name of Tutcankhaten's wife, was confined to a single word, the nalne of the god Amfin being substituted for that of the god Aten. Thus if "TutCankhamiin" means "Living Image of Amin,".then "Tut'ankhaten" must mean "Living Image of Aten "; of this there can be no question. But to translate "TutVankhaten " in this way is to assume that its bearer had the hardihood, even before he became king (for this was his " personal " name), to call himself the " living image " of the one Egyptian god who was studiously and completely shorn of any anthropomorphic associations. Surely such a name would have been utterly repugnant to Atenist ideas, as being not only blasphemous but ridiculous. Although at other times the idea of the King as the living presentment of the solar god is common enough, in the Aten period such a name, especially if borne by a non-royal person, as Tutankhaten originally was, seems to be almost unthinkable. There is also a grammatical difficulty. If the idea expressed were "Living Image of Aten," we should expect Twt Cnh nZ Itn, with the indirect genitive after the adjective (cf. ERMAN, Grammatik, 1911, 218 Anm.); compare sgp Cnh ni Itm, "Living Image of Atum," Nebti-name of Tuthmosis III; Shm ntrr nv Hpri, " Divine Form of Khepri," "Golden- Horus" name of Sethos I; Ti?t ?ht nt fmn, "Glorious Symbol of Amiin," epithet of Hatshepsut (SETHE, Urk., iv, 357. 12). But another interpretation, which not only removes these difficulties, but conforms the name to a common type, lies near to hand. That the first element of the name, twt, is here the well-known word for "image" is an unnecessary assumption, and is even unlikely for a graphic reason mentioned below. There is another word twt, an adjective, which means something like " pleasing."' It is found written exactly as in the name of Tutcankhaten, and indeed occurs in the latter's " Horus-name," which is Twt-mswt, Tewet-maswet, "Pleasing of Birth," i.e., he the birth of whom is pleasing2. Taking, then, twt in " TutCankhaten" as meaning "pleasing," and rendering the second element, Cnh, as "life "3 instead of "living," we obtain the meaning " The Life of Aten is Pleasing," and the name falls into a well-known class-compare the royal names MerCankhre?, "The Life of Re? is Lovely"; Khac Cankhre?, "The Life of ReC is Resplendent "; DedCankhrec, " The Life of ReC is Enduring." 1 For examples see Gardiner in Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch., 1914, 23. The adjective seems to mean (a) "agreeable," (b) "like," from the verb twt "to agree, accord with, resemble," with which twt(w) " image," "resemblance," "likeness," must also of course be connected. Twt(w) "to assemble" is probably also related. 2 Amosis I bore this as his "Nebti" name; and for twt in a Horus-name cf. also Twt-hew, "( Whose Accession is Pleasing " (Tuthmosis IV). 3 It is also quite possible that rnh, here and in the three other names cited just below, is the verb "to live" in Adm-f " {Aten lives} is pleasing," i.e., it is pleasing that Aten lives, etc.; but this is not the place to discuss the point, which does not materially affect my contention.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON TWO EGYPTIAN KINGS 253 The interpretation of twt here as the adjective "pleasing" rather than as "image" is further supported by the writing of the name. The words twt "image " and twt " pleasing" are both normally written with the sign 3 after r ; but in the name TutCankhaten or Tutrankhamuiin we regularly find ca) only, as though to indicate that the word for "image " is not meant, for twt "pleasing " can dispense with the sign 3 (an image) much more easily than can twt "image," where 3 is an essential word-sign. And in the King's Horus- name Twt-mgwt, where twt can only be the adjective, we also find the writing rc 1. 1 So also in the Horus-name of Tuthmosis IV, and cf. MARIETTE, Karnak, 34. 35. The word perhaps loses its from graphic assimilation with : "thou,"just as the latter, on the other hand, is frequently written o or e :. in the Eighteenth Dynasty. The two words "image" and "thou" were perhaps homophonous (twate ? twdt ?) at that time.</page></plain_text>
