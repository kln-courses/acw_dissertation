In recent years, STEM-related activities have become more common in schools with the hope of generating greater student interest in STEM. A Framework for K-12 Science Education spelled out the importance of teaching engineer- ing processes alongside scientific in- quiry, which paved the way for the strong emphasis on engineering in the Next Generation Science Standards (NRC 2012). A STEM activity is any activity that integrates the use of science, tech- nology, engineering, and mathemat- ics to solve a problem. Traditionally, STEM activities are highly engaging and may involve competition among student teams. For example, many elementary schools are involved in building the strongest bridge out of popsicle sticks, the longest slinging catapult, or the most protective struc- ture for an egg so it can be dropped from high distances. Even though students are highly engaged in these types of STEM activities, they are usually isolated from regular class- room instruction. A more effective use of STEM activities is to integrate them into classroom lessons. This ap- proach allows the teacher to create a STEM unit in which students are actively learning science content and then applying that knowledge to de- sign a solution to a perceived problem. Young children are natural engi- neers and often times spontaneously build elaborate structures while they are playing (NRC 2012). For this rea- son, early elementary grades are often the most appropriate time to begin to incorporate deliberate engineering design problems. The following is a STEM unit that was completed over two weeks in a kindergarten classroom that focused on the problem of build- ing a trap to catch a mischievous gin- gerbread man (see NSTA Connection for objectives). Some might worry that the use of anthropomorphism might be misleading to young children. However, anthropomorphic texts have been shown to provide meaning- ful scientific learning (Gomez-Zwiep and Straits 2006). Even though this problem was fictitious, the unit incor- porated all aspects of STEM, and stu- dents learned how these aspects can be integrated to solve real problems encountered in their daily lives. Science To introduce this STEM unit, the teacher gathers the students at the rug for story time. The story for that day was the traditional folktale The Ginger- bread Man. The teacher read the story up to the part where the gingerbread man ran away from the third or fourth animal (right before he meets the fox) and then closed the book. He then told the students ^ about several "events" that had happened re- cently at their school. For example, books were knocked off of a library shelf, dirty footprints were all over the lunchroom tables, some papers were knocked off the principal s desk, and some of the classroom crayons were broken in half. "I think the ginger- bread man is loose in our school,'' the teacher told them. "What do you think we can do?" "We could stay up all night in the school and see if we could see him," one student suggested. "We could make a trap!" another student excitedly exclaimed. "That's a great idea," several children agreed. The children were now faced with a problem. In order to solve this problem, students first needed to ex- plore the science that surrounds the problem. Prior to this STEM unit, the students had completed a physi- cal science unit where they had dis- covered that objects have different properties (e.g., size, shape, texture, weight, and color). They had also explored the movement of nonliving things (e.g., fast, slow, zigzag, up and down, back and forth, and so on) and how the properties of materials can affect their movement.

Along with the science standard, this unit also addresses standard K-2-ETS1 Engineering Design and meets the performance expectations K-2-ETS1-1, K-2-ETS1-2 and K- 2-ETS1-3 (NGSS Lead States 2013). This unit also incorporates the follow- ing science and engineering practices: Defining Problems, Planning and Carrying Out Investigations, Analyz- ing and Interpreting Data, and Us- ing Mathematics and Computational Thinking. It also supports the cross- cutting concept of Cause and Effect. Designing Solutions The perceived need created by the gingerbread man problem made for an engaging learning environment. The students first made drawings of how they would trap the gingerbread man. This was useful preassessment for the teacher since it indicated which students had prior knowledge with traps and how they worked. The students then shared their drawings with a partner and students were en- couraged to make changes to their drawings based on conversations with their peers. After making their initial draw- ings, students were given several materials to explore including card- board, fabric, rubber band, marble, and cork. Students were asked to con- sider the properties of these materials and which would be most useful for making a gingerbread man trap. They recorded their answers on the student sheet (see NSTA Connection). The students concluded some materials would be most useful because they are strong. "Your trap has to be able to hold the gingerbread man once you catch it," one student remarked. Other materials like fabric and string were also considered useful since the gingerbread man might get "tangled up" and therefore trapped. Working in pairs, the students were then given cardboard, tape, scis- sors, rubber bands, pipe cleaners, paper cups, and yarn. Using these materials, students practiced build- ing traps, paying particular attention to the pushes and/or pulls of the ma- terials that caused the "springing" of the trap. The students discovered that when making their traps there was always something balanced (either a trap door, a dangling cup from a 66 Science and Children</page><page sequence="3">Basic trap design instructions.

A push or pull was then used to cause this object to become unbalanced and "spring" the trap. "All he has to do is bump this stick and bam - the box will fall on him," one student re- marked. The teacher used a checklist to evaluate the students' proposed traps (see NSTA Connection). Technology and Engineering Technology is the product of engi- neering. This product can be created during an engineering activity or may be used by students during ei- ther science or engineering activities. So how can students use what they learned about properties of materi- als and forces to design a gingerbread man trap? While gathered at the rug, the teacher presented the students with the following materials: a poster board, a wire coat hanger (straight- ened), string, cups, and tape. The /¡v teacher made sure students / ;' sat at a safe distance from the CAUTI0M straightened wire hanger so that they would not come in contact with its ends during the demonstra- tion. The teacher asked, "How could we use the poster board in our trap? What might the string and cups be used for?" The teacher then bent the coat hanger wire in the shape of a C and asked, "How might this be used? The teacher asked, "How will the gingerbread man spring the trap?" The teacher then demonstrated by attaching the string to the cup, run- ning the string over the coat hanger wire, and pulling the string on the other side of the wire hanger so that the cup stayed suspended in air. The teacher asked, "What would hap- pen if I let go of the string?" Stu- dents predicted that the cup would fall. The teacher let go of the string and the cup fell down. The students quickly discovered that they needed something to hold the string in order for the gingerbread man to spring the trap. Through these types of guided questions, the teacher and students came up with a basic trap design (see Figure 1). In order to keep the data collection manageable for this age of student, the teacher wanted to keep the designs fairly consistent so only limited variables could be ma- nipulated. For this reason, he worked with the students in their initial trap designs through guided inquiry. This scaffolding is essential to the learning progression of these developing engi- neering skills. The teacher then introduced the word technology to the students. He explained that technology is when you use science and engineering to develop a tool that can then be used in our daily lives. These tools are sometimes called inventions . He then read several poems from Incredible Inventions by Lee Bennett Hopkins (2009). These poems were used to il- lustrate that technologies are found everywhere, from Band-Aids to roller coasters, and that they can be devel- oped by anyone, even young boys and girls.

Encounters Wind: Young Readers Edition by Wil- liam Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer (2012) can also be read to further illus- trate the point that technology and en- gineering solutions can be developed by anyone, regardless of age and cul- tural background. After reading the poems, he asked the students for other examples of technology and explained that the students had developed a new technology when they used the sci- ence they had learned about materials and forces to make their traps. Engineering and Math After the class had developed their trap design, the teacher then ex- plained that they were going to be "acting like engineers'' and wrote the new word on the board. The teacher explained that an engineer uses technology to design a solution to a problem and read the story, En- gineering the ABCs : How Engineers Shape Our World by Patty O'Brien Novak (2009). Throughout the fol- lowing engineering design and test- ing process, the teachers assessed the students through observation and questioning using a rubric (see NSTA Connection). The teacher then asked, "How can we get the gingerbread man to want to come into our trap?" "It needs to look inviting like a gingerbread house," one student hypothesized. Another student thought, "It needs some type of bait." The teacher ex- plained that when engineers are mak- ing their designs that sometimes they have to make multiple changes in or- der to find the perfect solution. The teacher wrote inviting and bait on the board and explained that they would need to work on them one at a time in order to see which design feature was most successful. The students started with the ap- pearance of their traps to make them more inviting. Prior to this class, the teacher and student teacher made one basic trap design for each pair of stu- dents. Teachers and parent volunteers also helped the students with the fi- nal assembly and decoration of their traps. Working in pairs, they colored gingerbread house pictures along with Disney characters and added them to their traps in order to entice the gingerbread man to spring the trap. Students also added cotton balls to the cups (trap) so it would look like a cloud to further fool that tricky gingerbread man. Once students were finished with the outside appearances of their traps, they set them in the halls all around the school building to see if they could catch the gingerbread man (see Figure 2). The following day, the teacher created a bar graph on the board. She explained that engineers collect data and make graphs to tell them if their designs are working. She and the students then went out around the school to observe their traps to see if any had caught the gingerbread man. As the students entered back into the class- room, each pair of students indicated with an "X" if they had "caught" or "not caught" the gingerbread man and then gathered back on the rug. The students were somewhat disap- pointed that no one had caught the gingerbread man. The teacher re- minded the students that engineers often have to make changes to their designs to finally find a design that works. Referring to the graph, the teacher asked, "Does making our traps invit- ing seem to matter?" Since no one had caught the gingerbread man, the stu- dents concluded that the appearance of the traps was not enough to attract the gingerbread man. "Now let's try adding bait," the teacher suggested. She offered three types of bait for the students to choose from: jewels, gold coins, and crystals. Working in their pair groups, the students selected one type of bait and added it to their traps. The following day, the teacher put a graph on the board. Each pair of students was given a sticky note based on the bait in their trap. Again, they observed their traps and indi- cated on the graph if their trap had made a catch. Students were more excited today because some of the traps had made a "catch." Before school, the teacher had placed a gin- gerbread man cookie (in a plastic bag) in the traps that contained the jewels. Referring to the graph again, the teacher asked, "Does the bait in your traps seem to matter?" "Yes!" 68 Science and Children</page><page sequence="5">the students exclaimed. "Would anyone like to change your bait?" the teacher asked. A resounding "Yes!" was received from the groups that had not made a catch. The students who had not made a catch changed their bait to jewels, and all students reset their traps. The teacher placed two gingerbread man cookies in the traps this time so each student would have one to eat. The students then collected data again and created a third bar graph on the board. Referring to the last graph, "So were your traps successful?" asked the teacher. "The gingerbread man must like jewels!" exclaimed one student. The teacher explained to the students the engineering pro- cesses that they had just completed. They had used engineering to design a solution to a problem. They used mathematical data to evaluate their designs and then made revisions based on this data (see NSTA Con- nection for the rubric). The teacher also pointed out that they all had been engineers. Conclusion At the conclusion of this unit, the teacher read a letter left to the class by the gingerbread man: Dear Mrs. Roghaar's Class , I am leaving your school to continue on my way. I have a fox to meet and a river to cross, but I waňted to tell you that your traps worked! I was able to escape , but since you were such clever students to trap me, I left you some gingerbread cookies to enjoy. Have a great day! The Gingerbread Man While the students enjoyed eating the gingerbread cookies, the teacher reminded them of the science, tech- nology, engineering, and math that they had used to solve the schools gingerbread man problem. This STEM activity was not an isolated activity, but an ongoing unit in this kindergarten classroom where students were introduced to how STEM can be used to solve real-world problems. Not all stu- dents were familiar with the ideas of technology or engineering, but after completing this unit they noticed examples of technologies in their daily lives and actively participated in the engineering process. During this unit, students started to become aware that even though science, tech- nology, engineering, and math are different, they are intricately related in the problem- solving process. ■ Kimberly Lott (kimberly.lott@ usu.edu) is an assistant professor of science education at Utah State University in Logan, Utah .
