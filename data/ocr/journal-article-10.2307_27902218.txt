<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS AND LIVED EXPERIENCE Some two hundred years ago the course of philosophy was changed, and we shall in this paper take it for granted that we cannot return to an earlier standpoint. We have left behind, not simply the notion that we can penetrate the nature of things by pure reason, but also the idea that our knowledge moves in ever widening circles of objectivity toward a standpointless comprehen sion of things. Absolute comprehension is a mere regulative idea, although even that is misleading if it suggests that we could some how speculate on what it would be like to circumscribe the world in some enormous final circle. The idea that the world is inexhaustible is part of this turning point, but that is in itself not a new idea. What is more to the point than an indefinitely long parade of new facts is the permanent possibility?even within the limits of some absolute but undiscovered conditions of thinking?of revising our human schemes, or, if you wish, of revising our concepts of what, relative to schemata, is to count as an element or part of a system, or as an instance of a general law. There is another legacy of this change in the course of philoso phy, but it is one we only mention here. It flourishes at present. In philosophical anthropology, in anthropology itself, and in lin guistics, there is a search for the rock-bottom limitations or condi tions of human experience, theorizing, or meaningful talk?a search for the ultimate "grammar" of all thinking and acting. So it is that alongside liberal, relativistic approaches to world-interpretations, there exists a peculiar desire to show how all such interpretations ultimately have the same sense. Here I shall not consider any of the manifold issues in this new transcendentalism. And as for the ques tion whether or not man, in virtue of special characteristics, is bound to be a monkey-wrench in the machinery of any systematic world-interpretation one might propose, we shall for the present put it aside. One might like to hold out for the idea that any question about the "nature" of man would exhibit the same open ness which questions about the world in general do.</page><page sequence="2">276 LEE . BROWN To defend an attitude toward ontological interpretation is al ready to take an ontological stand. To prefer an approach which views the world as pieces to put together is already to show a friendliness toward ontological atomism. It stands in sharp contrast to a mode of thinking which prefers a quite different category, or family of concepts. What we have in mind are concepts of the interpenetrating, the melting and flowing, the logically fuzzy, or?to recall a classic example from Sartre?the viscous. These metaphors, often drawn in modern times from a certain fascination with a certain picture of consciousness (even the Sartrian example is a recognizable relative of the philosophy of Bergson), all have the effect in philosophy of leading us toward ultimate silence. Some times, of course, the talk goes far beyond legal closing time. Let us admit our preference for legitimization of what one might call perpetual chatter. At any rate, in the following, we want to draw a contrast between two variations on a theme. The theme is the ambiguity of phenomena. It is the idea that there are alternative descriptions of the world which are equally supportable and that we must dispense with the naive objectivist notion that there is one way the world is. Now this theme is not a new one, but it appears to be a vigorous element in modern continental philosophy.1 The fruit of it is a sort of philosophical liberalism. Several views or cultural "worlds" are perhaps entitled to be called relatively adequate perspectives on the world. Perhaps such views reflect the peculiar sensibilities of per sons, cultures, or times. At the same time, the openness of the world l We have in mind the call for a return to immediate experience found in modern phenomenology, but primarily in its post-Husserlian forms. Some of the ideas of Jaspers, Heidegger, Marcel, and Scheler have contributed to the general picture. In addition, there have been borrowings from linguistics (Saussure), psychiatry, biology (von Uexkull), and theology. Many of the same themes still live on in current discussions among structuralists. A number of American writers have tried to pull many strands together for a common cause. Professor John Wild's book Freedom and Existence (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1963) is especially useful for detailing common elements within and near the phenome nological movement. We shall refer often to his work on the subject, especially since he wrote not simply to expound ideas of his own, but in order to diagnose the recent movement. One can have sympathy with the diagnosis but wonder whether the result is a tenable position. (Freedom and Existence is hereinafter cited as FE.)</page><page sequence="3">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS &amp; LIVED EXPERIENCE 277 must at all cost be defended against any intellectual fanaticism which tries to close off the cosmos with a fixity or finality which can only do violence to the mystery and ambiguity of existence. There are various methods of giving dialectical grounds for such relativism, and few are new. If one considers any object of knowl edge, it may seem evident that it is not, after all, an utterly simple datum, but, being complex, and therefore investigable, is always capable of fulfilling or disappointing our expectations. But isn't the way it fulfills or fails to fulfill such expectations a function of what schemata we employ, a function of certain prior dictates regarding which elements will count as aspects of which objects, or what elements are supposed to count as an object? If I consider a sensory field?what I take to be the room spread out before me, for instance ?I might recognize that the parts of the field could be interpreted, organized, or structured in a great number of ways depending upon such prior dictates, and ultimately upon our habits or our interests. And if one considers the totality of existence, as in some way philosophy has tried to do, we seem to find ourselves in an even more unsettling position. Neither the cosmos nor phenomena are given as a set of clearly distinguished pieces we merely have to get together in a coherent way. Interpretations go on in a world in which parts are fuzzily related to an even fuzzier background. The whole is a realm of ambiguity, surprise, and possibility. The world, one may finally conclude, is too much for any one systematic account of it. The existence of a fixed view can only imply that someone has made a sort of surgical cut, the nature of which will depend upon the thinker's values or cultural outlook. The world as a whole is not a thing of a certain kind of which the active intellect of man is supposed to grasp the form. Now there is, we claim, something important in these patterns of thought which can be defended, but it must be stripped of certain excesses. One can claim, without absurdity, that we need not talk in philosophy about the one way the world is. But there is an unac ceptable version of this claim which, as we shall see, in fact assumes that it has found the single form of the world, thus betraying the philosophical democracy it proclaims. The false scent is the idea that something is always left out in any interpretation of the world. And of course this idea has been made dramatically explicit in notable cases in the past. The universe is intrinsically indetermi</page><page sequence="4">278 LEE . BROWN nate, an inchoate flux, a whirl, or a monster of energy such that our theories can only be understood as artificial restraints which we attempt to impose upon things, perhaps in accordance with needs, the "will to power," or one's life project. Thought, in other words, only succeeds in lifting off bits of desiccated skin, inevitably missing the living substance of existence. There is another theme, though, in recent versions of this thought. The idea that the world is open to interpretation is at once refreshing and unsettling. True, it may seem to go hand in hand with human freedom. But an element of our Romantic heri tage persists. For we are not content with mere interpretations. We are reluctant to stop until we have laid claim to some sort of direct relation to reality which does not have to justify itself by articula tion in systematic theory. This sense of alienation from immediacy can even be understood as self-alienation to the extent that the immediate is implicitly pictured in terms derived from mind, the stream of consciousness, or Self (or from prior theories about these). Once it is decided that abstract theories either must ignore or falsify what is contained in an unmediated confrontation of man and world, then it seems equally evident that such theories are never human enough. Thus it happens in modern philosophical literature that the being who articulates and masters the whole world is so often shown as lost to himself. At any rate, this idea of effecting a return to the human world has dominated much of recent philosophical writing. A few are content simply to sing a song of human existence, but those who remain within the tradi tional philosophical pale have struggled to articulate human exis tence while keeping in touch with the given. One aspect of this campaign, then, will be to call attention to experience, feeling, immediacy, or life. One must point up the apparent abyss between this side of things and the bloodless ab stractions which lie on the other side. And one must subject to criticism any ontology which attempts to present a systematic, ana lytically-developed mapping of the world.2 2 Immediate experience plays a sort of teleological role in this philosophy. It must be recaptured by fighting our way through the screens and encrustations of abstract theory. Perhaps it even functions as a kind of analogue of the Absolute. One recalls that Bradley thought immediate experience to involve a kind of foreshadowing of the nature of the Absolute.</page><page sequence="5">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS 8c LIVED EXPERIENCE 279 The two sides of the new relativism are nicely brought together by John Wild. To discussions about the distortions and falsifi cations of abstract theory, especially in the form of scientism, he brings the other strand: Authentic world-views always reflect the resources of individual human beings out of whose freedom emerge various relatively adequate interpretations. Ontological fanaticism is thus put in its place, and the human dimension is protected on two counts: the freedom to interpret, and the resistance of immedi ate human experience to abstract theorizing. In order to undo the ravages of abstraction, we must first return to the "things themselves/' to the Lebenswelt or domain of "world facts," as Wild calls it, which we find to be "confused," "concrete," and "sloppy," at least "from a logical point of view."3 It is a mish mash of interpenetrating qualities or aspects virtually dripping with one another and leaking out over any conceptual boundaries we try to impose on them. A picture of experience is drawn, in other words, in terms which might be derived from Bergson, from Bradley, perhaps, or from radical empiricism. Indeed, Wild discusses James at length as a precurser of the kind of phenomenology he hopes to see make progress.4 Now it is not unnatural that the return to the human world be interpreted in terms of radical empiricism, once this immediacy is thought of as the special domain of the concrete, the unique, the individual, or the personal (all contrasted with the abstractions of the intellect). Perhaps it is the mushy, indeterminate (and hence, unanalyzable) character of experience as described by radical em piricism which is decisive. Here one can detect oblique references to the most important human category of all?freedom. That a sym pathetic expositer of recent phenomenology detects in it the philosophy of radical empiricism is interesting in other ways as well. The refusal of immediate experience to yield up a structure or fixed essence seems to go hand in hand with its willingness to yield to diverse interpretations. But again freedom appears to be involved. The ambiguity and fuzziness make possible freedom in the form of interpretation. A world-view which did not admit it would be false in the sense that it would "dehumanize man." 5 if there were 3 FE, p. 63. 4 FE, pp. 62-66. 5 FE, p. 75.</page><page sequence="6">280 LEE . BROWN essences hidden in immediate experience, then one would expect the job of philosophy to be completed with their discovery and elucidation. Who would care about an idle enterprise devoted to the elaboration of an obbligato about the main theme? From this point of view it is an intrinsic ambiguity, density, or richness which is at issue when the radical freedom of thought is at stake; and at the same time, these intrinsic characteristics must be presented to us as part of the very fabric of the Lebenswelt. It is, of course, not a new idea that through a return to immedi ate experience we may be capable of waging successful battle against the abstract. Experience, described by James as the "bloom ing, buzzing, confusion," but recognizable in Bradley as well as in Bergson, is precisely the concept James himself invoked to fight what he called "vicious intellectualism," or the "treating of a name as excluding from the fact named what the name's definition fails positively to include."6 And it is this garb which is worn now by a new form of metaphysical relativism. In the new relativism experi ence, as isolated phenomenologically, as purified of all theory, is the source, that from which all theory is merely "derivative," and thus capable of only "partial" or "technical" truth. So we need not begin with a preconception about the universe?that it is infinitely dense, a monster of energy, or what not. We begin more modestly, with characteristics of the stream of consciousness or of human life. The term "derivative" is a crucial concept in this approach, but it remains problematical. It reminds us of traditional empiricist theories of evidence or abstraction, but in the contemporary litera ture on the subject it is not elucidated in those terms. It cannot mean simply "logically derivative." Immediate experience is held to be richer, wider, and in some almost Plotinian way more basic than any theory which originates from it. And there is always more in it than in any abstraction derived from it. At any rate, the supposed faults of abstract theorizing are not really a new issue. Materialism was held by Bradley to take an arbitrary cut out of a thick set of qualities and then to suppose that this set exhausts reality. In the classical variations on this theme there are some well known difficulties. Sometimes the conclusion of the argument is based, not upon some vague bulginess attributed to reality, but ? Essays in Radical Empiricism (New York: Longman's Green, 1958), p. 60.</page><page sequence="7">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS 8c LIVED EXPERIENCE 281 upon a prior ontological analysis of it?that any segment contains an infinity of subsistent qualities, relations, relations among these, etc. In that case, of course, we have what is not only a dubious piece of Platonistic ontology in itself, but one which is made exempt from general relativistic or sceptical strictures. (Numerical infinitude could not be used as a premise in such arguments anyway, since ontology is formal). In other cases, where the argument simply rests on the obscure character of things-in-themselves, one is always en titled to ask by what right we begin with this idea. The notion that the cosmos is more or other than any formulation of it could only be a gratuitous suspicion. And it may well be asked what one could reasonably be thinking in entertaining the suspicion. The recent relativism does not appear to have any such diffi culty. We do not begin with groundless theories about the nature of the cosmos or things-in-themselves, but just with the intrinsic char acter of experience. We are not asked to penetrate what is granted to be impenetrable. Let us return to the virgin territory then. What do we find? Any number of things we have forgotten or lost through theoretical processing and packaging?experience rich with value, emotional tone, and all sorts of characteristics we often call "anthropomorphic." And what do we make of it? The first thing to notice is that when we have, as it were, climbed down the Platon ic ladder, we find ourselves oddly enough at the top rung of an other. For instead of simply pausing to drink in experience in all its freshness, instead of giving ourselves up to life or feeling, we make our way back into another department of the university. It is not Science, or Physics, but Phenomenology. For it is phenomenology which carries out this reflective rediscovery of experience. The classical objections are apparently not relevant to this re flective inquiry. There is no question, it appears, about how we know or what we mean when we give the grounds for a meta physical relativism. For what we mean is now completely fulfilled in intuitive experience. We are face to face with the given. Still, there will be questions to ask. And ultimately it is doubtful that we do much better in exchanging the thing-in-itself for the formless given. One odd feature of the program is that we are asked to return to the Lebenswelt?the mushy and indistinct?but also to elucidate its structure. Phenomenology has special privileges. A characteristic</page><page sequence="8">282 LEE . BROWN theme which may seem to mitigate this oddity is the distinction between approaching experience from "within" and approaching it from an observational position "outside." Now what is it to be "inside?" The distinction is sometimes employed to get at problems about separate cultural points of view. But it is sometimes used to get at something rather like a Cartesian distinction.7 There is a point to these metaphors when I am considering the problem of seeing things from your point of view. How do I get into your "world"? By learning your language, by dialogue, perhaps, but not by any special philosophical method. The "inside" may be figura tive, but it conveys meaning. But could I apply it to myself in the same sense and still make sense? Or doesn't the "inside" now carry the burden of a distinction between being inside the mind and being outside it? The reality upon which our abstract activities do their rough work is the mind member of the pair. It is immediate consciousness?blurry, indistinct, fuzzy. The model of the inner seeing we have when we relocate ourselves inside this region might be something like Bergson's intuition. As an organized program of natural history, it is phenomenology which will investigate the source of all theorizing, the primitive origin of all abstractions. It will diagnose its structure, or rather, pseudo-structure. At any rate, one can detect here an echo of the classical Carte sian idea of that which, since it lies in the mind, is easier to know with adequacy. Seeing from inside is actually a seeing of an inner side. The fuzziness of the subject matter is no real obstacle, since we are in the midst of it. But along with the rough outlines of a Cartesian division there is an inversion of values. It is the inner, the private, the personal which have preeminence. It is only when we succeed in turning away from the realm of objects and their spatial qualities (mere abstractions?) that we find reality in the fuzzy streaming of experience. We can feel existence from the inside while elucidating from the same privileged point of view what is felt. Now to the extent that such dualistic themes are at work in the concept of the Lebenswelt, then the ontological neutrality sought in the return to the "things themselves" is compromised. One might regard this detection of Cartesian metaphysics in the philosophy of 7 Wild seems to have both in mind. See FE, pp. 52, 68-71.</page><page sequence="9">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS &amp; LIVED EXPERIENCE 283 the Lebenswelt as perverse. Indeed, this philosophy is known for its contempt for dualism. Suppose then that "Lebenswelt" is not a term which really denotes thinking substance. The aim of returning to the preconceptual given may still not be realized. For it is still difficult to see how the concept "Lebenswelt" functions except as some kind of interpretative category (whether Cartesianism results or not). In applying the term, we begin to draw a whole picture of experience. We mark off that which is in some way basic or prior, as contrasted with that which is derivative. If drawing attention to the fuzziness of experience as it is "lived" from the inside is not really to draw attention to some overlooked ontological realm, it is still to put experience in a new light. We are not concerned to develop the picture further here. We are sceptical of its philosophical usefulness. But this must be how things stand. Otherwise, "Lebenswelt" would be a mere label for ordinary experience. And what would it mean to return to this? Of course it might be claimed that having so labelled ordinary experience, if we then look and see, we will everywhere find vague ness and ambiguity. But looking and seeing are not quite to the point if we have to make an effort to see things in these terms. If the domain of "world facts," as Wild terms it, is just the class of ordinary things or states of affairs, such as the pen lying on the table, to use Wild's example,8 then one may not be able to see in what way such things as the pen, or the pen-percept, or the fact that it is on the table, are blooming or buzzing. Indeed, the domain of "world facts," the "world of the street," as James called it, seems to be full of characteristics in striking contrast to the picture drawn by radical empiricism. It contains sharp differences, separations, and boundaries of all sorts.9 One suspects that there is a temptation to slip back and forth between these various uses of this difficult concept. As a technical or interpretative concept its use is still guided by certain recognizable pictures of the domain ordinarily called consciousness. Other times it is a label with no Cartesian piety intended. As a mere label, then of course we will not be able to use it to pick out any privileged category of features or qualities which one might want to say are 8 FE, pp. 41-43, 50. Perhaps Professor Wild did not really mean to say that the Lebenswelt is one of the well-confirmed "discoveries of phenomenology." See FE, p. 46.</page><page sequence="10">284 LEE . BROWN metaphysically basic. For all we are doing is rounding up all our ordinary descriptions of things. We may be rounding up the whole class of ordinary experiences?that the same water feels warmer to one hand than to the other, for instance?as contrasted with sci entific theories meant to account for these deceptions, but that will still not give us the slightest hint about what kinds of things or qualities are metaphysically ultimate. For there is no kind involved here. It is difficult to use the concept of the Lebenswelt as a metaphysical instrument (and yet it is attempted). We could not say that physical, chemical, or spatial qualities alone are given and hence ultimate. But on the other hand we could no more easily say such a thing about the nongeometrical, the personal, or the fuzzy. If you emphasize these, I shall complain that, as I see the matter, what you are doing is proposing a new piece of surgery which differs, to be sure, from that of materialism or scientism, but which is equally arbitrary and restrictive. What is ruled out in "humanist" versions of the Lebenswelt is not simply the class of so-called theoretical entities. It extends to countless aspects of the world of the street which are by no means the creatures of science. One suspects that what remains are just those aspects which reflect the presence of men in the world. Spatial characteristics, for instance, are tolerable insofar as they exhibit a human approach to things. In any de humanized form, they are mere abstractions?indeed, in some ac counts of the matter, barely more than words. In effect, then, the pendulum swings to the other extreme. The ultimate features of things are no longer their physical or measur able characteristics, but all those which were thought to have been rudely ignored by scientistic theories. The individual, the melting and flowing bits of feeling, the private and unobservable?what a book you're reading "means to you," as Wild says1(&gt;?are now placed in bold relief. Phenomenology will recapture the "anthropo morphic" or "subjective" elements contained in simple everyday descriptions such as "the pencil is on the table."11 So it is that the dead are resurrected. We have a massive reassignment of what was classified as unreal or subjective, together with a dismissal of the inhuman or impersonal. But it is surely troublesome if the bounda io FE, pp. 67,91. H FE, pp. 52-54.</page><page sequence="11">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS 8c LIVED EXPERIENCE 285 ries of the Lebenswelt are so flexible. The concept can be used to serve any set of metaphysical values. One can have a Bergsonian or Jamesian view of the given. Why not a phenomenalistic one? So it is that an act of interpretive, even evaluative, "philosophiz ing" comes to be regarded as an act of recognition of reality. To link this act with the world of the street gives it the appearance of a reminder of plain, everyday facts. What we have all along, then, is interpretation and not discov ery, but as philosophical interpretation one of its faults is that it is incomplete. All the uninteresting judgments about clock-time, spe cific gravity, and geometrical shape are classified as abstractions. But they are not really accounted for. They are said to be abstracted or "derived" from experience, but "derived" is not explained. One wonders if the determinations in question aren't just being thrown into a metaphysical scrap-heap. Science is accorded a "partial" or "technical" truth, but this does not really amount to much if we take seriously the suggestion that "abstract essences" are the "mean ings of science."12 (What are abstract essences for a radical empir icist? One wonders if science is just about nothing, or perhaps only about words.) And concepts such as "derived" or "founded on" remain without clear positive meaning. (In a similar plight, White head actually tried to make a construction of abstracta from the given, as he interpreted it.) The result is a gap which contains a number of classical philosophical issues. And to the extent that the connections between the abstract and lived experience were made clear, then surely that would after all seem to contradict the idea that abstract statements such as those of science are not about concrete reality. For if there were a successful derivation, construc tion, or whatever, then that would explain exactly how these ab stract statements really are about the concrete. We conclude that it is doubtful that the categories of phenome nological method have any special ability to direct us to a pure given. The vocabulary of radical empiricism suggests the opposite. Its very labels seem to refer us to experience, to the given, to the empirical, etc. But, as we suggested earlier, the machinery of phe nomenology is mainly interpretative. Experience is now thought under the headings of world-horizons, fringes, temporalizations, 12 See FE, p. 69.</page><page sequence="12">286 LEE . BROWN etc.; and, to recall an old issue, we distinguish, not between mind and body, but between life as lived from the inside and life taken observationally or theoretically, and between the body as lived and the body objectified. It is the concept of the given which is most troublesome in all this. Isn't it really pointless to ask how things are given, or what they are given as? Is visual field given as two aspects, three parts, or 40,000 slices? And how are the parts given? It is far from clear what one is asked to do here. What sort of answer we give would appeal not to the given, but to the schemata we employ. How is space given? As personal or impersonal? What does one say? Of course, one can answer a related question: as we usually describe our spatial surroundings, there is as much of the imper sonal in our descriptions as of the personal. I might call my room my lair; but I might also refer to it as an element of volume large enough to include me, you, and others, as a public realm in which public objects are located, in other words. But the question of what space is given as is just unanswerable. It is not first intuited as personal or impersonal. One may attempt to elaborate a systematic exposition of space, or of the spatial descriptions and references that we use. To describe such a schema or mapping as impersonal is only to compare it, not to some directly given properties of space, but to some other schema which in some way is articulated in terms which are more humanistic or personal. There is no privileged insight into any given, nor is there any privileged mapping which faithfully copies the way things are and which therefore records the distance between the way and the miserable attempts on the parts of theories to approximate it. And again, if the given is only roughly equiva lent to the "world of the street," then there are answers to questions about how space is given, and they do not seem restricted to the personal, the human or the logically or spatially fuzzy. One might even say that space is given as Euclidean, in the sense that we measure things, solve problems, calculate distances, and so on, in the "world of the street."* 3 13 A completely different question is involved in the issue of a supposed anthropomorphic element concealed in ordinary judgments such as "the pen is on the table." That the "on" is really anthropomorphic is neither given nor proclaimed so in the everyday world. That it is so is the product of some sort of dialectic.</page><page sequence="13">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS &amp; LIVED EXPERIENCE 287 It is fashionable to compare a supposedly pure phenomenolog ical seeing with other inferior, inaccurate, or artificial ways of looking at things. Thus laboratory observations, for instance, are thought of as falsifying or distorting because they use certain sup posedly artificial conditions or "arrangements." I examine the blue litmus paper. What is artificial about the situation? Perhaps the point involves an appeal to radical empiricism again. The blue one sees in the laboratory is artificially ripped out of the whole texture of experience and again left naked, alone, and not quite itself. If the point is that in the laboratory certain features of things are ignored, then surely ordinary perception, once again, is also in dicted. Perhaps the point is that the litmus paper is seen as an acid indicator rather than as a dullish piece of colored paper in a charming little glass. But surely we are seeing things as this or that all the time, and not just in the laboratory. If the point is that the things which are taken as data or evidence are always theory-con trolled, so that there are no pure theory-free data, that may well be true. But in that case, the contrast we are looking for is a contrast between a looking which is imperfect just because it is theory controlled in some degree and a kind of innocent looking which truly apprehends the real nature of immediate experience. That seems to be part of the implication of the slogan "to the things themselves." Is one to believe that ordinary perception is in some way pure? If not, that would at least explain why we must appeal to phenomenology to restore the Lebenswelt. But the ambiguities in "world of the street," "world fact," and Lebenswelt emerge once again. From one point of view, the world of the street is just everyday experience. From another point of view, it is what emerges after the world of the street has been worked on by phenomenology and the application of its successive epoch?s. But is the world of ordinary experience itself a product of making "arrangements," so that if we'd just let go or submit to phenomenology (and its arrange ments!) we'd see that ordinary experience was really the experience of radical empiricism?14 14 There is much more to the story about science which cannot be taken up here. It is said that laws only refer to "artificial" situations. Scientific accounts are thought of as fanatically fixed and rigid. It is thought that scientific explanations "reduce" everything to the quantifiable. A related error is the idea that there is</page><page sequence="14">288 LEE . BROWN At the beginning we noted how pictures drawn from radical empiricism are used to lend credence to the idea that various world views may co-exist, each having a kind of partial truth. But there are views and views, apparently, for some?the abstract ones?may be ruled out altogether. Of course, if analytical ontological schemes seem hopeless, that is because experience has already been charac terized in a certain way. This altogether too tender approach to ward experience can be exaggerated by equating analysis with scientific theorizing, as Professor Wild, for instance, seems to do.15 He argues that various dimensions of experience (the "anthropo morphic/' for instance) cannot be "analyzed" scientifically. He contrasts the scientific-objective way with "another way," namely phenomenology. One gets the impression that "analyze scientifical ly" is redundant for him and that the disjunction "phenomenology or science" is exhaustive. And there is a closely related contrast between experience "before analysis," i.e., the Lebenswelt (in a radical empiricist sense presumably), and experience after analysis. He alternatively characterizes the latter as the "objective" universe, "all the things there are."16 So phenomenology is itself opposed to the analytical (just involving immediate experience somehow), scientific analysis is redundant (what does traditional philosophy do?), and "the things there are" (ordinary objects of everyday experience, apparently) are just the products of a distorting (sci entific) analysis I Of course, the scientism is Wild's own if he identi fies analysis or conceptual elucidation with causal theorizing. And the ambiguity in the idea of ordinary experience is "resolved" by the suggestion that the pen on the table, or my belief in it (the original example of a world fact), is a product of falsifying and inauthentic attitudes. But there are other kinds of interpretations, presumably, which do have title to at least a partial perspective on existence. It is not just one science (some blown-up version of mathematical physics). Another issue calls up the tired ghost of Professor Krug and his pen, for demands are made that this or that thing or event be deduced from general laws alone. Such faulty criticisms of science, together with the blurring of science and scientism, only serve to obscure the issues which generate them?questions about human freedom and the nature of the person. 15 FE, pp. 52-53. 16 FE, p. 76.</page><page sequence="15">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS 8c LIVED EXPERIENCE 289 entirely clear from the literature what sorts of things are included here. Perhaps the proper example is a cultural system, that of the Trobriand Islanders, for instance, as contrasted with abstract ontol ogies. (Perhaps the latter is derivative in some way that the former is not.) Whatever sort of world-theory is meant here, a little reflec tion suffices to show that it won't really fare any better than abstract or scientistic theories. For the partial truth which various inter pretations might have had vanishes when one tries?as one will?to give meaning to "partial." One will find, in effect, a common core that all these theories express, or, if not that, show special tolerance for. Wild's way of putting this is to say that we do not rest content with exhibiting the form of a particular "world." The philosophical task is to build a bridge between worlds and thereby temper this pluralism. We want to ask, regarding these worlds, what "they really mean." We hope to gain some light on the common conditions found "in every version" of the world, and "catch glimpses" of "that single human world . . . which transcends" all these versions.17 This knowledge would enable us to criticize some versions of the world as false, inauthentic, or in some way inaccept able. Even though the world can be seen as many things, it cannot be seen as anything. But what is the common element in these various worlds? (Ig nore the question of what sort of "truth" the culture of, e.g., the Trobriand Islanders is meant to have.) One might suppose that a phenomenological analysis will yield certain essential structures exhibited by human existence. By comparing various worlds through intuitive induction, or by a dialectical calculation of possi ble permutations (as with L?vi-Strauss), we will discover a kind of essence. But it seems evident that the apprehension of an essence would neither disclose nor fit nicely with the theme of openness and ambiguity. Isn't this the situation, then: The falsity or inauthenticity of certain views comes down to the fact that they fail to do justice to the intrinsic ambiguity of phenomena. Abstract theories are false in the sense that they dehumanize man, whose necessary medium is this realm of ambiguity. But nonabstract world-views fare little IT FE, p. 124.</page><page sequence="16">290 LEE . BROWN better. If radical empiricism were an intuitive truth, then of what metaphysical interest would be the peculiar differences among these various outlooks? Just as the great variety of living beings is a mere index of the boundlessness of God's essence, so too the variety of view-points is interesting, not for any separate truths they contain, but only for the primordial openness to which they point. The philosophy of radical empiricism is invoked to communicate the idea of real ambiguity, openness, and fluidity in the world (as one might speak of real possibilities). The ambiguity is the intrinsic property of phenomena, and since there is clearly no possible way of picturing this in theories, we will find ourselves in mysticism. Any theoretical articulation of phenomena will at best be a cheap imita tion of the real character of things. But all along we have tried to indicate what is true in the theory we have criticized. For it is surely the case that ontology is an open enterprise, and not merely in the obvious sense, that rationalistic certitude and finality have given way to a willingness to revise. If it is the case that there are different ways to put the pieces of phe nomena together, then there is a more radical truth at stake. And it is the case, for we show it in practice. If it is objected that an ontology is already prejudiced in its regard to what are to be taken as pieces, then let us simply embrace the idea, for it is undoubtedly true. For there is no unbiased contemplation of the given. What is unacceptable is the idea that the world is too rich or complex for any systematic understanding, and that any system must distort or over-simplify. The implicit demand is that an interpretation or description of the world must deliver the universe itself or, in lieu of that, its faithful portrait. For to call a system over-simple is simply to propose another more complex one which is also more adequate.18 It is not to remind us of intrinsic features of the given. One may compare various pictures with respect to complexity, but how would one really compare a picture with the intrinsic complex ity of the thing pictured? How, without some system?however rudimentary or unreflected it might be?should we ever begin to count the elements of the thing pictured? How could it be simple or complex? The openness of the world is not some mysterious extra character which things have in themselves. 18 On this point, see Nelson Goodman, "Science and Simplicity," in Philosophy of Science Today, ed. Sidney Morgenbesser (New York: Basic Books, 1967).</page><page sequence="17">WORLD INTERPRETATIONS 8c LIVED EXPERIENCE 291 Of course it may seem that we have after all admitted the existence of something no system can capture and about which we must remain silent. (It would be hard to see how it could be something we could intuit or contemplate either.) But we do not really have to admit any such mysterious feature or extra relation ship within phenomena. What there is in the idea of such a left-over shows itself as a relationship between man and the world which may not be at all mysterious. It is only the ingenuity with which facts and systems are in various ways brought into accord with one another. Two final comments are in order, one about science, the other about Husserl. As we have characterized "openness," a general scientistic ac count of the world could not be ruled out in advance. It would be relevant to argue that such an account was not powerful enough to give a complete ontological explanation of our ordinary experience. But such an account could not be ruled out by the mere claim that the world was open to interpretation! Husserl, of course, thought that no complete scientific explana tion of the world was possible, and it was to explain himself that he developed the concept of the Lebenswelt in his late Crisis of Euro pean Science.19 Although the concept was his creation, it is not Husserl's thoughts on the subject that we have concerned ourselves with. A word of explanation is necessary here. It is quite true that many of the ideas we have seen were suggested by Husserl: The lived world was contrasted by him with a mathematical idealization such as that developed in physics since Galileo. And the Lebenswelt was characterized as a domain of the human or anthropomorphic. And he argued that science forgets that all its abstractions are in some way derived from the soil of the everyday lived world. Hence, he wanted to expose what he thought was science's mistaken sense of self-sufficiency. At this point, we begin to make contact with Husserl's philosophical idealism. Scien tific activity needs a grounding which it could never provide for itself. In Husserl's idealist framework, man cannot be a part of nature as understood scientifically. Or at least the transcendental side of man cannot be so understood. 19 Husserliana, Vol. VI (Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1950).</page><page sequence="18">292 LEE . BROWN HusseiTs concerns about scientism were bound up with special problems within this philosophical idealism. Other writers tried to apply the concept of the Lebenswelt outside that special context, while in other ways amplifying it. For Husserl himself, the Lebens welt is mainly a label for those "trivial" truths of everyday life?that there is a world, that there are many people in it, that we all have bodies, sensations, physical powers, etc. Our "forgetfulness" regard ing the Lebenswelt and the need to "return" to it can be explained this way: We do not literally forget it or return to it. Nevertheless, we do have a peculiar modern tendency to identify "explanation" with "scientific explanation," thereby forgetting that the trivial truths of everyday life need some sort of accounting for (which science cannot give). It is not an ontological survey of the composi tion of everyday experience which is at issue, or a question about what characteristics or qualities are more immediate, more basic, or more real. The needed explanation is an explanation in terms of constitution by the transcendental ego. All the trivial truths of the Lebenswelt (in particular, the very fact that there is a plurality of persons), and all the distinctions made within it have to be ex plained in a priori transcendental terms as dependent upon the constitutive activities of the transcendental ego. So the role of the Lebenswelt in Husserl's philosophy is in separable from a kind of contest he imagined between science and his own transcendental idealism. The science of the modern world has the effect of making us forget the necessity of transcendental explanations in terms of constitutive idealism. Subsequent writers managed to free the concept of Lebenswelt from some of Husserl's special and difficult preoccupations while at the same time letting it take on new metaphysical overtones. Lee B.
