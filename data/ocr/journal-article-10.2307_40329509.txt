<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOR HEYERDAHL AND THE PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND By J. Golson the first volume of the Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific1, Easter Island prehistory is divided into three periods : Early, Middle, and Late. This division is based on phases of architectural change in ceremonial platforms (ahu) thought to be of general occurrence throughout the island (cf. Smith, pp. 183-4, 213-6) and indicative of fundamental events in its culture history (cf. Heyerdahl p. 497). The purpose of this article is to examine some of the conclusions reached on this score, through an analysis of the data provided by the excavation reports themselves. The evidence for three stages in ahu development is derived from Mulloy's excavations at two ahu at Vinapu, where alone was any systematic attempt made to trace the development of an ahu in all aspects at all stages. Smith's investiga- tions at seven other ahu involved only minor excavations, where excavations were conducced at all, designed to clarify specific points raised by study of the superficial remains. Though in a general way Smith's conclusions support those of Mulloy, there are some obscurities in his work, particularly as regards the early stages of the structures to which he devoted his attention. Even at one of Mulloy's Vinapu ahu, No. 2, excavation, through shortage of time, was confined to one half of the structure and stopped short, with one small exception, of its earliest levels (p. 115). The result is that we are well informed about the latest phases of ahu history (what the excavators call the Late Period) and also, since Late Period activities involved as much the masking as the mutilation of the underlying structure, about the final form of the ahu as ceremonial platform (which would fall in the excavators' Middle Period). What we are ignorant about, however, are some aspects of the ahu's earlier history, partly as a result of insufficient excavation, partly because of the obliteration of early features by later events. Ahu No. 1 Vinapu The earliest structure at Vinapu 1 (Figures 15, 130) consisted of a central plat- form with high seaward facade, extended longitudinally in both directions by wings in the form of a masonry facing backed to landward by a sloping ramp of earth and stone. The high wall of the central platform stood to seaward of the 1 Archaeology on Easter Island. Edited by T. Heyerdahl and E. N. Ferdon, 1962.

Constructional details noted during the investigation (pp. 103-104) suggest that the structure was planned and built as a unit. The masonry techniques of platform and wing walls are identical, though there are some differences of style, material and nature of foundation (pp. 101-104). The famous seaward facade of the central platform exemplifies the type of work. It consists of two courses of large slabs of vesicular basalt, long axes horizontal, each prepared on all edges to meet its neighbours and any deficiences of material made up by precisely fitted basalt patches. The outer surfaces of the slabs are uniformly dressed, curving outwards from the joints. The wall retains a core of well fitted cobbles. The platform is significantly oriented in respect of the sun : a line perpendicular to the seaward facade of the platform is within two degrees of the true azimuth of the rising sun at the southern summer solstice (p. 94). So far the reconstruction is beyond dispute since in the main these features of the early structure have survived through to the present. Further reconstruction, however, involves judicious extrapolation on the basis of meticulous observations of very incomplete remains. The inner wall of the central platform seems to have consisted of a facing of a single course of large, accurately fitted basalt slabs, the tops of which on the inside edges were provided with a distinctive chamfer. It is concluded on good grounds (pp. 102-103) that this chamfer was the seat of basalt capstones paving the entire top of the platform, though only one, above the seaward wall of the platform, was actually in position. Since the inland retaining wall of the platform corresponded to the upper course only of the sea wall, it is apparent that some form of backing must have existed on which the inland wall had its foundations. This is plausibly reconstructed by Mulloy (p. 104) as a simple rubble ramp surfaced with dirt, though direct evidence for its form was only discovered at its inland periphery and no further excavation was - or perhaps could be (p. 99) - carried out to check on its reconstructed profile (cf. Figure 14, section C-D). No signs of burial in the ahu were discovered nor was there evidence of a prepared plaza to landward, though the terrain there is reasonably level and smooth (p. 105). One of the most significant conclusions reached by Mulloy (pp. 104-105) concerns the lack of evidence for statues on the central platform at this stage in the history of Vinapu 1, though, as he points out, it would have been capable of carrying very large ones (p. 103). Support for this opinion presumably derives from two main circumstances : one that the statues demonstrably associated with the ahu (pp. 108-110) must, as we shall see shortly, be later than the early ahu that we are now discussing ; secondly that nowhere else, either in the late stone- work of the ahu or anywhere in its vicinity, are there remains of other statues. The above reconstruction constitutes the Early Period of Vinapu 1 for the excavator.</page><page sequence="3">40 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Statues were only erected on the platform of the ahu after what Mulloy judges to be a considerable period of abandonment marked by erosion and despoliation and followed by repair (p. 105). These were of the well-known, standardised type of Easter Island ahu image made from Rano Raraku tuff, usually provided with a topknot of red scoria. Six were erected, backs to the sea, on specially prepared base plates set in the top of the rubble core of the platform from which the capstones had been removed (p. 108). One of the statues rested directly above one of the original upper course slabs of the seaward wall which, tilted back by the removal of the core stones behind it, was not replaced in its original position but allowed to remain horizontal, the space above it being filled partly by another horizontally laid slab, partly perhaps by cobbles (pp. 105, 108). The repair was effective but incongruous in the context of the fine masonry of the Early Period seaward wall of the platform which was otherwise intact. The same typ2 of treatment is apparent in other necessary repairs to the core and masonry of the original structure (p. 108), being characterized by the use of small, easily moved and at times previously used stones (p. 105). This phase at Vinapu 1 then is marked, according to Mulloy, by a change in emphasis respecting the ahu platform, from a harmonious masonry structure finest towards the sea to a solid base for statues which faced inland (p. 105, cf. Ferdon p. 529). That the change was not due to an inability to cut and shape stone and handle heavy weights is proved by the treatment of the statue bases (pp. 108, 160) and the erection of the statues themselves (p. 105). Otherwise the ahu maintained in its new phase the features that it had originally possessed : central platform, flanking wings and landward ramp. Behind the central platform the ramp was now remade with a surface strikingly set with rows of large rounded boulders, the intervals between which were covered with small pebbles (pp. 108-109). This treatment was extended over the ramp surface of the inner wings out on to that of the outer wings. No burials associated with this phase were discovered in the ahu, nor evidence of the use of the smooth area landward as a plaza. This statue phase is the excavator's Middle Period at Vinapu 1. The next, and final, phase in the history of the ahu began with the overthrow to landward of the statues. Local traditions describe such destruction as a feature of late intertribal warfare on the island : the evidence of European explorers seems to suggest that at Vinapu 1 itself the statues were not all thrown down at the same time (p. in). The next event there seems to have been the construction beneath three of the demolished statues of a masonry structure bearing some resemblance to the stone houses at the Orongo cult site, used perhaps first as a dwelling and secondarily as a tomb (pp. 112-113). The characteristic feature of this phase, however, was the deposition of masses of stones over the ramp section of the ahu and between the fallen statues that lay on it. This stone mantle served as a cemetery for the burial of bones in bundles</page><page sequence="4">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 41 amongst the cobbles, but it seems also to have been built up with the deliberate intention of masking previous features of the ahu, particularly the landward wall of the central platform. The stones were piled most thickly here, thinning out on the wings towards the landward margin of the ramp (p. 114). Thus transformed, the ahu came to resemble a large version of the so-called semi-pyramidal ahu used for burial (Smith pp. 182, 216, Ferdon p. 532). This constitutes the excavator's Late Period at Vinapu 1. Ahu No. 2 Vinapu The same three phase development is reported by Mulloy for Vinapu 2 as for Vinapu 1, though no real attempt was made to explore more of the early phase than was visible at the surface. Early Period (Figures 20, 134) As at Vinapu 1, the basic structure, planned and built as a unit, consists of a central platform, astronomically oriented and with a fine masonry wall on the seaward side, jutting seaward of wing walls backed by landward sloping ramps. The resemblance between the two ahu extends as far as the presence along the seaward side and the end walls at both of a narrow cobble pavement. However, the wings at Vinapu 2 are simple affairs, not composite as at Vinapu 1, while the orientation of the central platform is to the rising sun at the equinox not the summer solstice (p. 94). It is in the masonry of the seaward wall of the central platform that one of the major conspicuous differences between the two ahu occurs. Placed on a foundation of different style, the extant fa9ade of the first phase at Vinapu 2 consists of large basalt slabs set with long axes vertical and conveys a quite different and more irregular impression than the facade at Vinapu 1 with its horizontally oriented slabs. This impression of irregularity, due to the fact that juxtaposed slabs of different size and shape are fitted by selection with only occasional reduction of the edges to produce a closer joint, is enhanced by the virtual absence of any dressing of the outer surface of the slabs and the making good of any deficiencies of material by selected and not precisely fitted patching stones (p. 120). The cultural identity of the builders of the two ahu is guaranteed, however, as Mulloy stresses (p. 120), by the sameness of treatment, at both, of the landward wall of the actual platform, which consists of squared and dressed basalt slabs with concave chamfer along the upper inside edge. This indicates, at Vinapu 2 as at Vinapu 1, an original pavement over the top of the central platform, some slabs of which indeed were found still in position on the unexcavated southern half of ahu No. 2. Though Mulloy says only that there is no evidence as to whether at this stage the platform carried statues or not (p. 120), one could advance much the same reasons as for Vinapu 1 that it did not. Due to absence of evidence from excavation, we do not know the nature of the backing to the central platform on which the slabs of the landward wall had their foundation. Mulloy (p. 121, Figure 20) reconstructs it as a simple ramp, but</page><page sequence="5">42 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND this is guesswork. Indeed, the evidence of a horizontal pavement uncovered by the only substantial penetration made by excavation of the Middle Period ramp suggests a different arrangement during the Early Period from that suggested for Vinapu i (pp. 116, 121). A noticeably different feature of Vinapu 2 is its association with an embanked enclosure on the landward side. No excavation was done at the point where the bank abuts the south wing of the ahu : Mulloy remarks that the surface indications of the presumed abutment are vague (p. 121). Consequently the attribution of the plaza to the Early Period depends completely on a single radiocarbon date from charcoal found beneath the mound at one point (p. 121 cf. Mulloy, p. 160, Smith, p. 212). There is no evidence for the date of the various features built within the plaza. No burials attributable to the Early Period were discovered on the ahu, but in view of the almost complete lack of excavation in the Early Period structure, this is negative evidence indeed. Middle Period (Figures 21, 135). As at Vinapu 1 Mulloy adduces evidence for a period of abandonment, erosion, despoliation and repair before the erection of the extant statues at Vinapu 2 (p. 121). The repair involved crude and at times incongruous restoration of the seaward and landward walls of the central platform. The latter, from which the Early Period capstones had largely been removed, became the support for nine statues erected, backs to the sea, on base plates of varied material, none as well finished as at ahu No. 1, set in the top of the rubble core (pp. 124-125). Behind the central platform at this stage was a ramp whose surface was confluent with the ramps behind the wings. The fact that the entire ramp was surfaced with rows of boulders and interstitial pebbles much in the manner of Vinapu 1 (pp. 124-125) shows that the total structure, central platform and wings, was of importance in the Middle as it had been in the Early Period. None of the burials found on the ahu are attributed to the Middle Period. There is no evidence as to the status of the plaza at this stage, nor of any of the structures on its surface. Late Period (Figures 22, 133, 136) In the absence of evidence for the close dating of a number of disturbances in the Middle Period ramp surface, which may denote its ceremonial disuse, the final phase in the history of Vinapu 2, as of Vinapu 1, begins with the overthrow of the statues. After this the ahu came to be used as a regular cemetery under and within the growing mound of stones that transformed it, in the same way as Vinapu 1, into a semi-pyramidal type of structure (p. 133). The cemetery consisted of stone-walled and slab-roofed graves excavated into the core of the ahu and rough cists and simple bundle burials beneath the fallen statues and in the stone mantle (pp. 131-132).</page><page sequence="6">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 43 The graves excavated in the core of the ahu could theoretically belong to the Middle Period. Of the two discovered, one lies across an area at one stage occupied by one of the overthrown statues, the weight of which Mulloy says (pp. 130-13 1) it could not have supported. The other example, a slab-covered ovoid tomb sunk into the ramp surface of the north wing, is considered to postdate the ceremonial disuse of the Middle Period ramp, the patterned stone surfacing of which its excavation interrupts and its spoil covers, and possibly also the fall of the statues, since amongst its building stones are a small statue fragment of Rano Raraku tuff and a block of red scoria possibly from the Middle Period central platform inland wall (p. 131). Buried in a depression in the Middle Period ramp surface was found part of a pillar statue of red scoria of a type that seems from historical evidence to have been standing in the vicinity of both ahu at Vinapu in the 19th century (pp. 133-135). This is the only evidence for use of the plaza area during the Late Period. Other Ahu Smith's survey of seven other ahu in a general way confirms Mulloy's findings at Vinapu, though it is also much illuminated thereby. It introduces to us minor variations in ahu construction and gives additional information of substance on specific points. Since the method of investigation was superficial study with very limited excavation largely confined, within the ahu itself, to removal of sections of the Late Period stone mantle, the new and variant features belong to the Middle Period and our knowledge of the earliest ahu is not sensibly increased. It is obvious from Smith's descriptions, for example of Ahu Tepeu 1 and Ahu Te-pito-te-kura, that whatever the general resemblances to the Vinapu sequence, each ahu had a highly individual history superimposed. Since Smith's field methods were not such as to disclose the organic unity, should that be possible, behind the separate features, he relies very largely on a concept of the progressive deteriora- tion of masonry execution to reconstruct the histories of the individual ahu. The attempt to express the details of these histories in terms of the Early, Middle and Late periodisation is sometimes a little strained (cf. on all this pp. 194-195, 207). Because of the lack of excavation and inadequacies of verbal and diagrammatic description, we can largely ignore for present purposes four of Smith's ahu (Hekii 2, Tepeu 2, Naunau and O-hae). Of the three remaining ahu Tepeu 1 and Te-pito- te-kura exhibit evidence of all three periods of ahu use (pp. 189-195, 195-207), while Hekii 1 (pp. 184-189) is interpreted as a new foundation of the Middle Period. Tepeu 1 and Te-pito-te-kura are both considered to have started life as single platforms, to which the wings, constructed with inferior technique, are looked upon as later additions by or in the Middle Period. The seaward wall of Tepeu 1 resembles that of Vinapu 2 with its basalt slabs erected with their long axes vertical : that at Te-pito has finely fitted basalt slabs with long axes horizontal as at Vinapu 1. Tepeu 1 - and Tepeu 2 - seem to be oriented with respect to the rising sun at the summer solstice, though here it is the landward side and not the seaward fagade</page><page sequence="7">44 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND (as Ferdon mistakenly says p. 528) that faces the sunrise. Te-pito is oriented solely with respect to the sea. A crucial question for further interpretation of these two ahu concerns the original form of the early platforms and the nature of subsequent reconstructions of them. At Tepeu 1 the seaward fagade as it at present exists exhibits a variety of masonry. The particular feature that interests us now is the occurrence in the upper part of the wall, above the level of the upright slabs, of horizontally laid rectangular stones derived from the foundations of boat-shaped houses, some with their stake holes showing on the outer surface. This is reasonably interpreted (p. 191) as a later stage of building and would be a parallel to the practice noted at Vinapu of the use of rather incongruous masonry to prepare the platform for the erection of statues. It is certainly on the platform thus constructed that the four statues at Tepeu were set up on base plates. In this statue phase, or Middle Period, the landward wall of the central plat- form consisted, we learn rather belatedly in Smith's summary at the end of his chapter (p. 213), of thin rectangular slabs with a chamfer on their top inside edges. These stand above, not a simple ramp as at Vinapu, but a step or terrace on which the overturned statues later fell (p. 191). Along the inland edge of this terrace, to judge from the drawn plan and sections (Figures 52, 53), stood a low slab retaining wall, beyond which there was a landward sloping, cobbled ramp. To landward of this is "an extensive area of level ground " (p. 189). Two circumstances may have induced Smith to suggest, as he does at p. 191, that the Early Period platform ended at the level of the highest upright slabs in the seaward wall : one, that the tops of these slabs " terminate in irregularly rounded contours " ; the second that this level is much the same as that of the step or terrace behind the Middle Period platform (Figure 53). In any case he tentatively re- constructs the Early Period platform (p. 195) as a low flat-topped structure, heightened in the Middle Period. Subsequently (p. 214) he admits that this con- clusion may be wrong and that an upper tier of Early Period masonry may have been replaced with horizontally laid stones better able to support the weight of statues. Though Smith says (p. 195) that certainty on this point could only have been gained at the cost of destroying part of the present structure (presumably to see whether the tops of the Early Period upright slabs had been dressed to receive another course), there is one circumstance which suggests that his second thoughts are correct. This is the presence of the apparently intact line of chamfered slabs along the inland margin of the Middle Period platform : such slabs are associated at Vinapu with the Early Period and the paving of the platform surface. Smith's explanation (p. 213) that these were taken from the Early Period wall and re-used is unconvincing, since this would have involved removing one wall and immediately replacing it with another (the one in position by the Middle Period along the land- ward side of the step, Figure 53). It is much more likely that the chamfered slabs occupied the same position in the Early as in the Middle Period.</page><page sequence="8">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 45 If this is so, the combined terrace and ramp was an Early as well as a Middle Period feature. The possibility that there existed in the Early Period alternative forms of backing to the simple ramp reconstructed for Vinapu 1 was, if we remember, suggested by the discovery of a level pavement beneath the Middle Period ramp at Vinapu 2. If, however, Smith is right and the platform once stood alone, without wings (p. 194), the ramp itself, which runs behind both platform and wings (Figure 52), may not be an original feature. In the total absence of any excavated inform- ation, however, speculation on this question is valueless, though the point is of some importance for the origins of the Easter Island ahu and investigation of it a fruitful goal of future work. Should the step or terrace behind the central platform at Tepeu 1 indeed belong to the Early Period, the burials on it (pp. 191-193) could theoretically have begun in the Early Period. A "Middle Period" radiocarbon date of ad 1629 ¬±150 on bone from one tomb is, however, preferred by the excavator to an " Early Period " one of ad 318 ¬±250 on totara reed from the same communal grave (p. 194). According to Smith the graves on the terrace must pre-date the Late Period, because the statues whose overturning is taken as marking its inauguration fell on the tops of the burial cists (p. 194) : the drawn section (Figure 53) shows this is certainly true of one statue and one cist, though the Vinapu evidence that not all statues were overturned at the same time (Mulloy, p. in) should be remembered in this connection. The strong possibility exists, however, that burial took place directly on the ahu at Tepeu 1 before the Late Period and this is information additional to that provided by the Vinapu excavations. Since the extant statues are associated with the rebuilt seaward wall of the Middle Period platform and no trace of other statues was found in the vicinity, the balance of the evidence at Tepeu 1 as at Vinapu 1 and 2 is for the Early Period platform not to have supported statuary. At Ahu Te-pito-te-kura Smith concludes from the nature of the upper edges of certain slabs of the seaward wall of the central platform that there may have originally been an upper course (p. 197). In addition a whole section of the lower course stones had at some period been removed and the repairs that were subsequently effected were carried out with cruder and less carefully assembled slabs on a more irregular foundation that veered slightly to landward of the original foundation. There were no indications that these later slabs ever carried an upper course. The platform thus reconstructed supported the enormous statue now lying broken to landward of the platform, the fall of which is by some authorities said to have been the last on the island (c. 1840) (p. 204). The above exemplifies the by now familiar Middle Period statue phase and its Late Period sequel. However, an unusual feature is that one of the slabs in the Middle Period repair of the seaward wall of the central platform is the torso of a statue of Rano Raraku tuff, to which may belong a detached head lying sea- ward of the ahu. This statue would seem to be of general ahu image type. It is therefore suggested that this statue and fragments of at least one more incorporated</page><page sequence="9">46 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND in the masonry of a Late Period structure on the ahu (p. 204) belong to an earlier phase of statuary at the ahu, not necessarily, however, an Early Period one (p. 207). The evidence at Te-pito does not illuminate the contentious problem of Early Period statuary, to which special reference will be made below. The inland wall of the Middle Period platform, where it still exists, consists of a lower course of stones well fitted by selection resting on a foundation of rounded stones and overlaid by a second course of loosely arranged round and rectangular stones (p. 202). Behind the platform is a narrow platform or step, beyond which a sloping ramp, confluent with the ramp behind the wings, leads down to a level pavement of flat stones running the length of the entire structure (Figures 54-56). What the situation might have been at the earliest phase of Te-pito's history is a matter merely for speculation, since no excavation was attempted behind the central platform beyond an examination of the Late Period stonework. If the bottom course of the inland wall of the Middle Period platform is a survival from the Early Period, the terrace or step and ramp may be, as was suggested for Ahu Tepeu 1, an Early as well as a Middle Period feature. Smith (p. 207) suggests, however, for Te-pito as for Tepeu 1 that the wings are later than the central platform. If this is so, then the level pavement that runs behind the entire structure, and possibly the entire ramp too, would not be original features. The same would be true of an apparently artificially levelled plaza (p. 197) shown on the plan (Figure 54) to be coterminous with the pavement. It is impossible to date with any certainty the two cist graves excavated in the top of the central platform (p. 202). As Smith points out (p. 207), they could be Early Period if the platform at that time was no higher than during the statue phase. Since his conclusion is that it was higher, he is inclined to attribute the graves to the Middle Period. They could, however, equally well belong to the Late Period. Indeed, if the description of grave 2 (p. 202) is correct, this cist must be veiy late indeed, postdating the construction of a shelter beneath the fallen statue, but since Smith in his summary (p. 207) does not refer to this circumstance again, perhaps the original description is in error. An interesting observation was made during the excavation of a trench through the west wing (p. 200). Some human bones were visible in the stone core of this structure, which, though it cannot be precisely dated, would be either Early or Middle Period at the ahu. Ahu Hekii 1 (Smith, pp. 184-189, Figures 50,51) consists of a central platform jutting seaward of two walls backed by ramps : an unusual feature is that one part of the platform is higher than the rest, which is at the level of the wing walls. The high front wall of the central platform is oriented towards the sea, with no reference to the sun. This and the wing walls consist of carefully selected stones fitted apparently without modification, long axes in the main horizontal (pp. 185, 187, Figure 51). The seaward fagade thus presented contrasts with the slab walls of the Early Period structures of the four ahu previously described. In addition</page><page sequence="10">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 47 the platform to which the central part of this facade belongs carried statues. In other words, ir contrast to the four previous ahu, there is no evidence for an original wall being repaired or reconstructed to fit the platform to carry statues. These two factors support Smith's conclusion (p. 189) that the initial construction of Hekii 1 belongs to the statue phase, the excavators' Middle Period. Some reconstruction did take place at the seaward wall of the central platform : it involved the building of an outer wall parallel with a section of the original, either to strengthen it where it was weak or replace it where it had collapsed (p. 185). Inspection of Figure 51 confirms that this was an addition to the statue carrying platform, not a preparation of it. One of the stones used in the new wall was the torso of a statue of Rano Raraku tu√±. Smith suggests that this was an original statue thrown down by the collapse of masonry which made necessary the second wall in which it is incorporated (p. 189). The most interesting feature of the later repair wall is that it exhibits the finest masonry of the whole seaward facade, with stones sometimes modified to give a better fit with their neighbours (pp. 185, 187). At the same time the overall style of the repair wall is that of the original (Figure 51). The inland wall of the higher part of the central platform was formed of thin dressed slabs of lava behind which was a terrace or step at the same level as the lower part of the platform. Though neither the text nor the figures (Figures 51, 53) are particularly clear on the point, it appears that behind the step or terrace there is a ramp, confluent with that behind the wing walls, which gives on to a level pavement so extensive that it is to be interpreted as a plaza (cf. p. 218). The fact that the end retaining walls of the two ahu wings run inland along both sides of the pavement gradually decreasing in height until they merge with the ground surface (p. 184) suggests that the pavement formed part of the original plan of the ahu. On the other hand the head of a statue of ahu image type incorporated in the pavement (p. 185) could conceivably be a relic of the postulated first phase of statuary at the ahu. Rectangular burial cists roofed with flat stones noted on both the higher and lower parts of the platform (p. 185) could belong either to the statue or post-statue phase, the Middle or the Late Period. The only one described (p. 187) would seem from the nature of some of its covering stones to belong to the Late Period. The subsequent history of the three ahu whose fortunes have been traced above into the statue phase is in essence that previously described for the two ahu at Vinapu. The statues at each ahu were overthrown, at Hekii 1 and Tepeu 1 as the inaugural events (pp. 187, 189, 191, 194), at Te-pito-te-kura, traditionally one of the latest, if not the latest, example of statue demolition (p. 204), as a secondary occurrence following on the piling of stones and making of burials on the terrace behind the platform (pp. 207, 216). At all three ahut as at the two Vinapu sites, a stone mantle was built up that served as a cemetery and transformed the inland contours of the ahu. At Tepeu 1 (pp. 191, 194) the mantle was very extensive, reaching along the two wings beyond</page><page sequence="11">48 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND the limit of earlier construction, forming a crude wall of small stones on the sea- ward side of the wings, and masking the step or terrace behind the platform by the piling of a sloping ramp of stones against the inland wall of the central platform and on to the central platform itself. At Te-pito-te-kura (pp. 197, 202, 207) the late mantle is confined to obliterating the Middle Period step by building over it a ramp confluent with the earlier wing and central ramps. At Hekii 1 the story is virtually the same, except that the mantle, thicker and more irregular in the vicinity of the platform, spills out landward over the existing ramp surface (p. 185, Figure 50). At all three ahu burials were associated with the late mantle (pp. 187, 191, 193, 202), in rough cists, in cavities beneath the fallen statues, or simply amongst the stones. This rather exhaustive analysis of the evidence of ahu development has been undertaken for two reasons : first because the summaries given by Smith (pp. 213-216) and Ferdon (pp. 528-533) stress the differences that make possible the periodisation of ahu history rather than the continuities through that history ; secondly because those summaries are not altogether accurate. There can be no doubt about the existence of three general phases in ahu use. The earliest phase, the so-called Early Period, is distinguished from the succeeding phase, the so-called Middle Period, by the character of its masonry, especially in the seaward fagade, and by the fact that its platforms do not seem to have carried statues. Mulloy (p. 160), Smith (p. 215) and Ferdon (p. 529) talk about the differences as a change in emphasis, in Mulloy 's words " from architecture to sculpture ". Smith very plausibly suggests (p. 214) that the purpose of the Middle Period reconstruction of the seaward fagade of the Early Period platform was to substitute for the latter's basalt slabs, horizontally laid masonry better able to stand the weight of the statues intended for its surface. The differences in masonry style are certainly not due to the inability of the Middle Period builders to work stone in the Early Period manner, as the preparation of statue bases especially at Vinapu 1 (Mulloy, pp. 108, 160) and the fitted stones of the repair wall at Hekii 1 (Smith, pp. 185-186) show. There is continuity of ceremonial site in four of the five ahu we have studied in detail and the list can be extended by reference to other structures noted by Smith (p. 214) and Heyerdahl (p. 501) as exhibiting evidence of Early Period and Middle Period masonry types. There is also continuity in ground plan : Hekii 1, a Middle Period foundation, has the projecting central platform and flanking wing ramps known in the Early Period and this Early Period plan is retained in the Middle Period structures that grew up on Early Period sites. There are further indications of continuity, some less securely documented. At all the investigated ahu, during both Early and Middle Periods, the inland wall of the central platform was a low structure corresponding to the upper part only</page><page sequence="12">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 49 of the seaward wall, the foundations resting on one or other form of backing to the platform. In the Middle Period at the two Vinapu ahu this was a simple ramp : at the three other sites dealt with it was a step or terrace standing above a ramp. There is little precise information about the nature of the backing in the Early Period. At Vinapu 1 it is plausibly reconstructed as a ramp : the incomplete information for Vinapu 2 suggests that here it must have been different. At Tepeu 1 and Te-pito-te-kura the Early Period backing may have been the same as or similar to the Middle Period backing at the same sites. There is definite evidence for an associated plaza to landward of the ahu at Vinapu 2 (embanked enclosure), Te-pito-te-kura (levelled ground) and Hekii 1 (extensive pavement). The Vinapu plaza is attributed to the Early Period on the strength of a radiocarbon date (cf. Mulloy p. 160, Smith p. 395). The pavement at Hekii 1 must be Middle Period since the Late Period mantle encroaches on to it (Figure 50). The plaza at Te-pito-te-kura could be either Early or Middle Period or both. " Natural " plazas may have been used on the landward side of other ahu (cf. Smith p. 218). The contrast drawn between the orientation of Early Period and Middle Period platforms (Smith pp. 213-214, 215, Ferdon pp. 528, 529) is less striking than appears. Of the five Early Period ahu described by Smith and Mulloy four have orientations with respect to the sun that appear significant in view of the " solar observatory " at Orongo (Ferdon p. 228). At two of these (Vinapu 1 and 2) it is the seaward facade that faces towards the rising sun. At the other two (Tepeu 1 and 2) it is the landward side (Ferdon p. 528 is in error on this point). Since at the two Tepeu ahu the fine masonry wall of the projecting platform faces seawards, it would seem that the relationship of the platform facade to the sea was just as important a factor in positioning as relationship to the sun. Indeed the Early Period ahu at Te-pito- te-kura has a seaward facing main facade but no apparent astronomical orientation. The Middle Period ahu of Hekii 1 exhibits the same features of position as Te-pito (Smith p. 184), as do two other ahu investigated by Smith and attributed to the Middle Period (Hekii 2 p. 187 and O-hae p. 210). Image ahu on Easter Island in general are oriented with high wall towards the sea (cf. Smith p. 183). We have little further concrete evidence on this topic. An inland ahu excavated by Mulloy in 1960-1961 is said to be astronomically oriented (p. 160, fn. 9) : the unexcavated ahu No. 3 at Vinapu is said to be not so oriented (Mulloy p. 94), though it is not explicitly stated that this ahu had an Early Period phase. No information is given for other ahu listed as Early Period (Smith p. 214, Heyerdahl p. 501) and Middle Period (Smith p. 216) structures. The question of the statues is a difficult one. Though the evidence is against the Early Period platform carrying statues, the possibility exists, as Smith points out (p. 213), that in the Early Period statues were placed elsewhere, for example in the plaza. This might account for the presence of statues in reconstructed ahu walls of the Middle Period. Alternatively of course this circumstance may be due to rebuilding and repair within the Middle Period itself. This, for example, D</page><page sequence="13">50 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND would be the explanation of the torso in the repair wall of Hekii i, a Middle Period foundation. The evidence is not clear at Te-pito-te-kura, but the apparent similarity of the torso in the masonry of the reconstructed platform wall to the type of Middle Period statue might support the same explanation. However, at Ami Naunau, a site studied by Smith (pp. 207-209) but not in- cluded in our detailed discussion above, a statue head is incorporated in a wall considered from the nature of the masonry and the siting of statues above it to be of Middle Period construction (pp. 208-209). The head, made of Rano Raraku tu√±, shows some stylistic deviation from the heads of the conventionalised Middle Period ahu images (p. 209). It is not clear whether Naunau itself had an Early Period phase to which the deviant statue could have belonged, but a nearby ahu, Niho-pou, seems certainly to have done so (pp. 208-209). At Ahu Mai-taki-te-moa, a site not investigated in detail, which Smith con- siders as dating from the Early Period because of resemblances of its masonry to that of the early phases at Tepeu 1 and Vinapu 2, a statue was incorporated during addition to or restoration of the seaward facade attributed to the Middle Period (Smith p. 214, Heyerdahl pp. 462-463, Figure 125, Plate 68b). This statue is notable by reason of its being rendered in basalt as opposed to the Rano Raraku tuff of the standardized type of Middle Period platform image. At Ahu Tongariki, substantially a Middle Period structure (Smith p. 216), one of the building stones in the bottom course of the central section of the seaward facade was a head of red tu√± (cf. Heyerdahl p. 83). Whether this somewhat aberrant statuary at Naunau, Mai-taki-te-moa and Tongariki is truly Early Period is uncertain and what its relationship to the ahu may have been is quite unknown. The same obscurity but in much greater degree attaches to a number of other statues or statue fragments of types also aberrant from the Middle Period ahu norm found in association with or proximity to other- wise uninvestigated ahu (cf. Heyerdahl pp. 463-468). At Vinapu 1, Vinapu 2 and Tepeu 1, three of the four Early Period ahu dealt with in detail above, no trace was found of any statuary beyond that erected on the Middle Period platform of each, except for the Late Period pillar statue of red scoria buried in the Middle Period ramp at Vinapu 2. It is difficult to know what weight to give this negative evidence. The masonry core of Ahu Tongariki, con- sidered by Smith (p. 216) to be an excellent example of a wholly or substantially Middle Period structure, delivered up a number of small statues, hitherto buried and unknown, on the occasion of its destruction by a tidal wave in i960 (Smith p. 216, fn.14). Mulloy describes how part of the Early Period core at Vinapu was restored in the Middle Period with stones that included Early Period cut stones, amongst them one capstone (p. 108). Very little examination was made at any ahu of the parts of the structure where disused statues might have been found, viz. Middle Period restorations of platform and ramp cores. On the other hand, for the ahu for which the most complete information is available, Vinapu 1, it is doubtful</page><page sequence="14">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 51 if much restoration of either was necessary at all and a lot of what was necessary was in fact investigated. Obviously the presence and status of statuary in the Early Period is unknowable on available information. The foregoing review is as full as the published evidence will allow on the all-important question of the relationship of the Early and Middle Period ahu. Though on a number of points comparative information is deficient, sufficient evidence has been assembled for essential continuity in ahu siting, planning, con- struction and general if not detailed use to suggest that no cultural break is involved in the change from the Early Period ahu to that of the Middle Period. Of the two expedition archaeologists who devoted their attention to the ahu, Smith would seem to be in implicit agreement with these conclusions, in that in his summary he does not discuss any alternative hypothesis (cf. especially pp. 216-218), while Mulloy, talking of the implications of the Vinapu investigations, reserves judgement on the question (p. 160). Heyerdahl, however, claims (p. 497) that the evidence uncovered by Mulloy and Smith demonstrates " a clear break " between the two periods accounted for by " a new impulse " which " brought about complete re- construction with different architectonic and religious concepts in mind " (rather a misuse of a passage in Mulloy p. 105 2 to which acknowledgment is made). This new impulse according to Heyerdahl may be the result of " the arrival of a second population group ". In making these interpretations Heyerdahl puts a lot of weight on positive evidence found by Mulloy at the two Vinapu ahu (pp. 105, 121) and less certainly dated evidence from Smith at Te-pito-te-kura (pp. 200, 207) for a period of abandon- ment between Early and Middle Periods (described as prolonged at Vinapu). Corroborative evidence is sought at the ceremonial site of Orongo for structural superposition separated by a period of abandonment (Ferdon pp. 223-229, especially p. 226), but the sequence here is not strictly parallel to that under discussion at the ahu. On the basis of these indications Heyerdahl thinks it worth speculating as to whether " Easter Island was actually abandoned in the interval between the two periods ". There is nothing in the excavated evidence to support this last idea at all, and a great deal to refute it. The period of abandonment at both the investigated ahu at Vinapu is marked not only by the effects of erosion but also by the deliberate removal of stone presumably for building elsewhere (Mulloy pp. 105, 121). At the inland ahu excavated by Mulloy in 1960-1961 an attempt " to control the extent of this cultural break " produced " less clear evidence of the abandonment of the site " between the Early and Middle Periods (Heyerdahl p. 497 fn. 4). By arguing in the way he does Heyerdahl falls into the simple error of equating stages in the history of individual ahu with fixed periods along an absolute time scale. 2 Mulloy's point is simply that the " techniques and ideas [of the Middle Period builders] as well as their attitude toward the structure [at Vinapu i] were very different from that [sic]. of the Early Period people ".</page><page sequence="15">52 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Heyerdahl proceeds (p. 497) to interpret the disturbed Late Period in terms of intertribal warfare such as is well documented by local tradition. In his view this warfare resulted from the co-existence of two different population groups (those of the Early and Middle Periods) or perhaps the arrival of a new group. There is no evidence from the ahu excavations themselves for this last suggestion (cf. Mulloy p. in for Vinapu). Both Ferdon (p. 532) and Mulloy (pp. 111-112) stress the continued significance of the old sites in the Late Period and offer as a reasonable explanation of the rather different form and function of the Late Period ahu the impossibility in the unquiet conditions of replacing the statues toppled and broken in the course of intertribal warfare, with a consequent loss of importance on the part of the central platform. Late Period transformation of the ahu involved in all investigated cases the masking of the platform's inland wall and attendant features by piles of stone which buried the fallen statues and served as a cemetery. That these features of the Late Period ahu became an established practice independent of a previous toppling of the Middle Period images is indicated by Te-pito-te-kura where the single large statue of the (late) Middle Period at the site fell on top of a stone mantle with burials (Smith pp. 207, 216). Each of the five ahu to which our detailed discussions have been confined experienced a Late Period. With the possible exception of O-hae none of the four minor ahu studied by Smith seems to have done so (cf. Smith p. 219, Table I). To support the opinion that there is as little need to invoke the activities of new groups of people to explain the Middle to Late Period transition as that from Early to Middle Periods, we need more evidence of continuity than continuity of ceremonial site. This must be sought in the sphere of the predominant Late Period ahu activity, that of burial. Burials in rough cists or simply under loose stones were common in the Late Period mantle at all the ahu reviewed. The status of the somewhat more regular cists sunk into the core of platform, step or ramp is more obscure. One of them, a somewhat elliptical slab-covered tomb on the platform of Vinapu 2, must, according to Mulloy (pp. 117, 130-131), postdate the fall of a statue and thus belong to the Late Period. If Smith's des- cription of the second rectangular cist on the platform at Te-pito-te-kura is correct (p. 202), this must be Late Period also. The suggestion that some of the material in the stonework of the slab-covered ovoid tomb in the north wing of Vinapu 2 (Mulloy p. 131, cf. also p. 116) derived from the Middle Period ahu and its statues would put this tomb into the Late Period. The slab covered cists aligned on the step behind the platform at Tepeu 1 (Smith pp. 191, 193, Figure 53) constitute the strongest evidence for burial directly on the ahu before the Late Period - in the Middle or theoretically, on the interpretation of Tepeu 1 offered previously, the Early Period. A radiocarbon date from one of these cists is interpreted as confirming the Middle Period attribution, but, as will be seen later, circular reasoning is involved in the choice of this date in preference to another radiocarbon date in conflict with it (Smith p. 193).</page><page sequence="16">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 53 All the other examples of burial in the core of the ahu at the sites discussed in detail could be either Middle or Late Period, or both (Hekii 1 p. 185, Tepeu 1, Figure 53, Grave 6, Te-pito-te-kura p. 202, Grave 1). This conclusion would also apply to the cist on the platform at Hekii 1 roofed in part with pieces of red volcanic stone that may have been cut from one of the statue topknots (Smith p. 187). Because of the two suggested phases of Middle Period statuary at Hekii 1, topknots might have been available for reuse within as well as after the Middle Period. More extensive excavation, for example on the step behind the central plat- form at Hekii 1 and Te-pito as well as at Tepeu 1, might have produced conclusive evidence as to whether ahu burial was indeed practised on the pre-Late Period ahu. The only other indication we have is the presence of human bones revealed by ex- cavation in the core of the western wing of Te-pito-te-kura (Smith p. 200) but we do not know if these were regular burials. The most fully investigated ahu, Vinapu 1, produced no evidence for burials being made on it before the Late Period. There is no doubt, however, that the ahu was a focus for burial long before the Late Period. Seven meters seaward of the south end of the central platform at Vinapu 1 (Figure 129) was a complex series of stone-lined cists containing a bottom layer of burnt human bone followed by a layer of beach pebbles like the ones used on the Middle Period platform and a filling of boulders and dirt. A radiocarbon date of ad 1228 i 200 was obtained from a sample of charred bone (Mulloy p. 100). In terms of the absolute chronology suggested for the periodis- ation of ahu history, this date falls early in the Middle Period if not the Early Period itself (cf. Smith p. 395). There is no other evidence of date. That this is no fortuitous juxtaposition of ahu and burials is suggested by the occurrence at Vinapu 2 and 3, in an almost identical position relative to the central platform, of un- investigated areas with similar surface manifestations (Mulloy p. 133, Figure 133). Against the seaward wall of the central platform at Vinapu 2 were excavated two structures (A and B) originally built on debris above talus that had developed on the narrow cobble pavement associated with the Early Period at the ahu (Figure 24). Mulloy plausibly identifies this debris with the phase of Middle Period re- construction and statue erection (p. 126). In a pit almost directly under the corner of structure A and dug from a surface somewhere in the stratum on which its foundation rested, was a cremation (Mulloy p. 130). Structures A and B were both reconstructed at least once as talus piled up in front of the ahu. In this talus a number of intrusive burials were made, some cremated, some not. Mulloy comments of the burials surrounding structure A that none could be shown to antedate it and most seemed to postdate it by a considerable time ; of those surrounding structure B, Mulloy says that all of them definitely postdated its construction and probably postdated its abandonment (p. 130). These burials provide evidence for the persistence of cremation into the Late Period, in contrast to Ferdon who says (p. 533) that no excavated evidence was</page><page sequence="17">54 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND obtained for cremation in the Late Period : note, for example a cremation in a shallow scoop from approximately present ground surface near structure A (Mulloy p. 128) and another slightly penetrating the talus directly above structure B and thus deposited after its abandonment (Mulloy p. 130). That cremated burials were not confined to the periphery of the ahu is shown by the occurrence of burnt bones in a cist on the platform of Hekii 1, which could be Middle or Late Period, or both (Smith p. 187). This review shows the existence of strong evidence for pre-Late Period burial in cists in the step behind the platform at Tepeu 1 and points to at least one firm example of Late Period cist burial, in the platform at Vinapu 2, and two possible ones at Vinapu 2 north wing and Te-pito-te-kura central platform. Other examples could be Middle Period, Late Period, or both. There is evidence for the ahu as a focus for, as distinct from the locus of, burial at Vinapu 1 and 2 and perhaps between the two undated lines of slabs in the immediate vicinity of Tepeu 1 and 2 (Smith p. 194). The crematorium at Vinapu 1 is early by the evidence of a single radiocarbon date. A cremation grave at Vinapu 2 is stratigraphically early : a number of other graves occur near it, the majority cremations, some of them by all appearances very late. It is impossible to say whether there is any general significance in the preponderence of cremations outside the two ahu at Vinapu and their absence from the ahu proper. The above evidence encourages the minimal conclusion that inhumation was practised on and cremation in the vicinity of some ahu during the Middle and Late Periods. The Ahu Makers Heyerdahl repudiates the suggestion (specifically of M√©traux) that the fitted masonry of the Early Period ahu is the product of local evolution on Easter Island (pp. 500-501). Not only is it a feature of structures of the earliest building phase but, according to Heyerdahl (p. 501), the finest example of such masonry, at Vinapu, 1, must stand close to the beginning of Easter Island prehistory, since Vinapu 1 is earlier than Vinapu 2 and Vinapu 2 is dated by charcoal under the associated plaza wall to ad 857 ¬± 200, the second earliest accepted radiocarbon date of the expedition. We are thus, in Heyerdahrs view, presented with evidence of the " importation of an already developed mason's art of very specialized type, with a markedly restricted geographical distribution ". Since no masonry style of comparable evolution is known in Polynesia and no possibility exists for its develop- ment on Easter Island from a primitive Polynesian introduction, Heyerdahl turns for the inspiration of the Easter Island style to the pre-Inca masonry of the Cuzco Valley in Peru with which comparisons have often been made. The antiquity of the Early Period structure at Vinapu 1 is obviously the crucial link in this chain of reasoning and Heyerdahl acknowledges Mulloy as providing the proofs. Mulloy's arguments for suggesting the chronological priority of Vinapu 1 over Vinapu 2, however, are highly circumstantial and ones on which he himself</page><page sequence="18">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 55 refrains from basing any explicit hypothesis. Mulloy makes two main points : one that the sloping nature of the site at Vinapu 2, necessitating special adaptation of the structure to the terrain, made it less desirable than the level site of Vinapu 1 (pp. 96, 115) ; the second that the considerable erosion visible in the vicinity of the Early Period northern inner wing wall of Vinapu 1, which was almost under- mined, may have been due to the channelling of drainage water by the construction of the plaza wall of Vinapu 2 (p. 105). √Ä propos of the removal of stones from the early structure at Vinapu 1 during the abandonment of the site between the Early and Middle Periods, Mulloy suggests (p. 105) that some of them may have been used in the building of Vinapu 2, though he admits that no single stone at Vinapu 2 could unequivocally be said to have come from Vinapu 1. Indeed there is some evidence provided but not pointed up that the very opposite may have been the case. This evidence (Mulloy p. 104) consists of the occurrence as part of a slab-laid altar-like shelf set in the landward side of the south wing ramp at Vinapu 1 of a stone with a small concave chamfer along the edge. This chamfer is like that along the inside upper edge of slabs forming the inland wall of some Early Period ahu platforms. The slab in question is much lighter than the chamfered slabs of Vinapu 1 and the chamfer much smaller : Mulloy says that it may have been one of the corresponding slabs at Vinapu 2. Mulloy also says (p. 104) that the altar-like shelf of which it formed part may date from the Middle Period. No reason at all is offered for this dating. On the contrary Mulloy includes his description of the shelf in that section of his report on Vinapu 1 devoted to the Early Period remains : his plans and sections (Figures 15, 16, 130, 131) show it as part of the Early Period and not the Middle Period structure, and in the section of the Vinapu 1 report devoted to the Middle Period he remarks that " the altar- like structure in the south wing had probably already been covered by natural forces, and the Middle Period people were not aware of it " (pp. 108-109). ^ tne altar-like feature at Vinapu 1 is indeed Early Period and if the chamfered slab that forms part of it indeed comes from Vinapu 2, Vinapu 2 must be the older of the two structures. Though the case is by no means proved, it is nevertheless interesting to look at the origins and history of ahu construction on Easter Island in its light. We may recall Mulloy's own description of the central seaward facade at Vinapu 2 with its differences from that at Vinapu 1 - the slabs fitted by selection with only occasional reduction of edges to produce a better joint, little or no attempt to smooth exposed surfaces or make them regular, the filling of small vacant spaces between slabs with selected stones (p. 120). To this Smith adds a most important observation (p. 213) : that whereas at Vinapu 1 (as also at Te-pito-te-kura) the rectangular slabs are set on edge, that is with long axes horizontal, those at Vinapu 2 (as also at Tepeu 1) are set on end, that is with long axes vertical. This arrangement Smith points out (p. 191) gives the seaward wall of Tepeu 1, and by implication that at Vinapu 2, something in common with the marae of Central Polynesia. Smith makes the further important point that the discovery of the enclosed plaza in an apparently Early</page><page sequence="19">56 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Period context at Vinapu 2 " reveals ... a hitherto unrecognized relationship at an early period between Easter Island and cultural centers farther to the west " (p. 218). If Vinapu 2 is earlier than Vinapu 1, the type of ahu with strongest Polynesian parallels becomes earliest in the Easter Island architectural sequence. Further resemblances might well still be hidden beneath the Middle Period ramps to land- ward of the platforms at Vinapu 2 and the perhaps at one time wingless Tepeu 1. The proposed redating also allows us to advance the hypothesis that the superlative masonry of Vinapu 1 was a local high development of skills not unknown to Polynesian stoneworkers elsewhere (cf. Heyerdahl p. 499 quoting Emory 1933, pp. 46-50). Nevertheless there are two features of Vinapu 1 masonry not reported from Polynesia that are said to be precisely matched in Cuzco stonework. These are the slightly convex finish of the dressed outer surfaces of the Vinapu slabs (Mulloy p. 101), to whose occurrence on Cuzco stonework Heyerdahl, quoting Imbelloni, refers (p. 498), and the precise fitting of juxtaposed stones for only a few centimetres near the f acade after which the contiguous edges are bevelled away from each other (Mulloy p. 101), a practice reported for Cuzco masonry by Bennett (Heyerdahl p. 500). How widespread or typical these practices are at Cuzco is not clear. Ferdon (p. 534) remarks that he has observed the two combined on at least one type of fitted masonry in the Cuzco region. M√©traux (Heyerdahl p. 500) and Skinner, in a paper (1955) not referred to, make a contrast between the solid, cyclopean masonry of Peru and the veneer-like use of slab facings on Easter Island ahu. Heyerdahl (p. 500) avoids and Ferdon in his concluding summary ignores discussion of the validity of this point. Skinner further sees the origin of the fitted masonry of Easter Island in the transference to stone of a carpentry technique exemplified in the plank work of Polynesian canoes. The Image Makers Like the structural details of the ahu the stylistic properties of the Middle Period platform statues of Rano Raraku tuff should give a clue as to the cultural inspiration of their makers. This is in fact not very clearly the case. The problem has a number of facets (cf. Heyerdahl pp. 505-506, M√©traux 1940, pp. 293-296, 307-308). Anthropomorphic stone sculpture on a megalithic scale is restricted in Polynesia to its south eastern corner, the Marquesas, Raivavae, Pitcairn and Easter Island. The Easter Island ahu images, however, show little stylistic affinity with the statuary on the other islands, or indeed elsewhere, for example South America. Moreover, they display a typological unity which has defeated attempts to trace the evolution of the style within Easter Island itself (cf. Skj√≤lsvold pp. 374-377). M√©traux was forced to the conclusion (1940, p. 308) that the origin of the Easter Island style lay in the transference of wood carving skills to volcanic tuff. The Heyerdahl expedition has given the problem a new dimension by producing abundant evidence of monumental statuary deviant in style and sometimes in</page><page sequence="20">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 57 material from the platform statue type. HeyerdahTs argument (p. 507) is that these discoveries make it clear that the Middle Period statues have an inspiration in earlier statues found on Easter Island itself ; that these earlier statues exemplify " a highly developed skill and .... sophisticated design " more compatible with " an original outside introduction " than " an art form in its beginning " ; and that while it is impossible, on chronological grounds alone, for this introduction to have occurred from the other Polynesian centres of monumental statuary, an inspiration from Peru is " chronologically, typologically and practically feasible " (p. 510). The chronological and stylistic assumptions underlying this argument must now claim our attention. The Middle Period ahu images are described by Skj√≤lsvold (p. 346) as belonging to a uniform type, with small variations, primarily in the ratio of length to breadth. They represent the head and torso, the transverse base occurring just below the stomach. The head is long and narrow, almost rectangular in shape, with heavily accentuated brows, hollow eyes, long expanding nose, narrow mouth, sharply marked chin and long narrow ears. Heyerdahl seems to accept as a matter of course (p. 507) that aberrant types of Easter Island statue are Early Period. In almost every case, however, they are quite undatable (cf. Heyerdahl 462-469). It remains to look at those examples for which an Early Period date might be proposed. The statue head of Rano Raraku tuff found in the Middle Period wall at Ahu Naunau (Smith pp. 208, 209) is not necessarily Early Period because we do not know the history of construction and reconstruction at the site. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that it is so. Some of this reasonableness derives from the very fact that it is deviant from the Middle Period statue form : the top of the head is rounded instead of flat, the ears are shorter, the eyes more deeply cut. Skj√≤lsvold (p. 374) claims that the rounded crown and short ears are found on two statues of basalt, one of them inserted in what Heyerdahl considers (p. 462) to be a Middle Period reconstruction of the seaward wall at Ahu Mai-taki-te-moa, the other a female representation discovered within three metres of the seaward wall of an unnamed ahu (Heyerdahl pp. 463-464). The former statue, being imbedded in a wall, was not available for complete inspection : the second, which lay free, displayed some similarities to the Middle Period statue type, especially in the form of the nose and mouth. The rounded crown, deep set eyes and small ears recur in an undated group of three statues of coarse red scoria described by Heyerdahl from Hanga-roa village (p. 464). We are told that this group is typologically intermediate between the standard Middle Period Easter Island form and some of the statues in Peru, Bolivia, the Marquesas and Raivavae. This is a statement, however, not the conclusion of a detailed stylistic analysis. There are no further examples within the typological class just discussed and the argument may now move on to another group of sculptures which are considered</page><page sequence="21">58 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND to be typologically linked (Heyerdahl pp. 465-466). One of these is the stone head found on the plaza of complex A at Orongo and characterised by large almond- shaped eyes in sunken relief, raised and curving eyebrows meeting in the middle of the forehead, short wide nose and oval mouth with raised lips (Ferdon p. 231). Somewhat arguable is the contention that several small inclusions in the rock which protrude below the lower lip were deliberately left to depict a short goatee. The sculpture is assigned to the Early Period because of the presence of almond-shaped eyes incised on one of the dressed basaltic curbstones of structure 1 at Orongo which, because of the masonry technique of its terrace edging, is thought to be of Early Period date. The oval mouth with raised lips is reported by Heyerdahl (p. 465) as occurring on a slab-like sculptured head of Rano Raraku tuff found in association with the paved way at Ahu Hanga-mai-hiku (p. 362), near Rano Raraku itself. These two heads also have in common a pouch-like treatment of the cheeks. The Hanga-mai-hiku example further shares with the Orongo head almond-shaped eyes in sunken relief, but possesses an additional feature of the eyes in the form of small depressions of the centre to denote pupils. This feature is found on the eyes of the unique kneeling statue excavated by Skj√≤lsvold out of any archaeological context near Rano Raraku (p. 360). In addition the kneeling statue has pouch- like cheeks and a goatee beard. As a provisional hypothesis Skj√≤lsvold (p. 374) regards the kneeling statue as an Early Period piece, " when it had not yet become the custom to place stone statues on the ahu platforms ", because the statue in question could not have re- mained upright without support. Ferdon (p. 252) and Heyerdahl (p. 465) accept an Early Period date for the kneeling statue apparently without question. Though Skj√≤lsvold considers the question of parallels for the kneeling statue in Polynesia (p. 361), both he (p. 362) and Heyerdahl (p. 508) conclude that its inspiration is to be found in the round-cheeked, goatee-bearded kneeling statues of the Tiahuanaco area of Peru. Heyerdahl would also see the origin of the Easter Island sculptured heads in stone heads from Tiahuanaco (p. 509). He further equates (pp. 508-509) the pillar-like statue found in a Late Period context by Mulloy at Vinapu 2, examples of which were in use apparently in the 19th century (Mulloy pp. 133-135), with pillar statues from the same area of Peru. In doing so both he (p. 509) and Skj √≤lsvold (p. 374) tend to think of the pillar statues on Easter Island as being originally an Early Period form. It is impossible on the evidence presented to know how to estimate the claims for South American inspiration in Easter Island statuary. Certainly the case is more convincingly argued with, for example, the kneeling statue than at other times, because it is there argued with some attention to stylistic detail (see especially Skj√≤lsvold p. 362). In any case it is difficult to see what bearing the parallels that Heyerdahl specifically claims between Easter Island and South American statuary in the form of the kneeling statue, the pillar statues and the sculptured heads (pp. 508-509) necessarily have on the origin of the Middle Period Easter Island image, as seems to be assumed (cf. Heyerdahl p. 510).</page><page sequence="22">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 59 On the other hand the existence of a possible Polynesian parallel to the Middle Period statue type is overlooked. This is the narrow rectangular head in pumice, found in a moa-hunting context in the South Island of New Zealand, with jutting brow and long slightly curving nose (Harding 1957). Though a single example, its existence may be significant. The Tool Makers As Mulloy points out (p. 151), though the collection of artifacts from the Vinapu area is large, the bulk of it consists of surface discoveries and other materials without specific associations. (See tabulation by Mulloy pp. 161-167). Remarkably few artifacts, and of a limited range of types, come from the ahu themselves, the majority of them from the Late Period mantle. This situation holds to an even greater extent for the ahu investigations conducted by Smith (pp. 193, 205-206). In reviewing the artifacts and the context of their discovery, we should remember two things : the limited nature of the investigations of the Early and Middle Period structures and (Mulloy p. 151) the possibility that at this type of site finds may be older than the context in which they were found. Excavations at the two Vinapu ahu produced the following artifacts in definitely Late Period contexts : 42 mataa (tanged spearheads of obsidian), 18 adzes or adze- like tools, one possible digging tool of stone, one stone pillow, three obsidian scrapers, and one worked stone disc. Middle Period contexts at the ahu produced definitely one and possibly another mataa, nine adzes, two stone bowls, one stone drill, one core tool, one basalt knife or saw, three obsidian files, five obsidian scrapers, one worked stone disc, one possible sinker of coral. In Early Period contexts were found no mataa, one adze and possibly one other, possibly one core tool and probably one obsidian scraper. Smith's excavations at Tepeu 1 produced 14 mataa in definitely Late Period contexts (p. 193), while at Ahu Te-pito-te-kura (pp. 205-207) he found three mataa and 25 crudely flaked basalt tools in or on the Late Period mantle, one basalt tool of similar type in the Early or Middle Period fill of the west wing, and two ear spools of shell from a grave which cannot be closely assigned to period at all. Artifacts recovered from other excavations, in the main at habitation sites, comprise mataa, stone adzes and picks, basalt knives or saws, stone bowls, obsidian picks, various types of obsidian flake tools (including scrapers and tanged knife blades - see especially Skj√≤lsvold p. 298 and Ferdon pp. 309-310), obsidian drills, obsidian discs, stone and bone fish hooks, and bone needles. Only limited success is achieved by the excavators in fitting these sites into the three period framework provided by the stages of ahu construction. This may be ascribed to the meagre range of comparable artifactual material produced by the ahu investigations, especially for the Early and Middle Periods : a not surprising circumstance since we are, on the one hand dealing with ceremonial sites, on the other with dwellings.</page><page sequence="23">6o THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND No real analysis, however, is offered in the volume of the material that is comparable from ahu and dwelling sites, and only in a limited way of comparable material from the dwelling sites themselves. Excavators are made largely responsible for the analysis of the artifacts recovered by their own excavations and a lack of consistency in description and presentation results. We are promised an exhaustive treatment of Easter Island adzes by Figueroa and Sanchez in a subsequent volume (cf. Heyerdahl pp. 401-402) : in the present volume the Figueroa-Sanchez classifica- tion is employed by Ferdon (eg. pp. 245-246) Skj√≤lsvold (eg. p. 302) and Smith (eg. p. 262) (but not by Mulloy pp. 154-155, 325-326), though there is little indication of what it is. The efforts of the reader to make his own assessment of the evidence of the excavated artifacts are frustrated by these circumstances, especially as only Mulloy and to a lesser extent Skj√≤lsvold provide adequate illustration of the finds, Smith relying on photographs of selected pieces (particularly unsatisfactory for flaked tools, cf . Plate 33) and Ferdon not illustrating at all. Perhaps these deficiencies will be rectified in future volumes. Excavation seems to have firmly established that the best marker, amongst the artifacts, of the Late Period is the appearance of the mataa in quantity : this correlates well with evidence from tradition and from the history of the ceremonial centres that the Late Period was a time of general unrest. Out of 44 mataa found in datable contexts at Vinapu 1 and 2, at most two belonged to the Middle Period. At Puapau Cave (Smith pp. 260-261) of 48 mataa, only one came from levels below those containing European trade items, and this only just below. At O-hae (Smith p. 266) 18 mataa came from the area of the natural shelter, of which 15 were found in the top 20 cms. (the levels that produced the few finds of European origin), the other three in the next 10 cms., and none in the 30 cms. of deposit below. The presence of mataa and /or European items may be used to attribute to the Late Period the upper levels at Puapau and O-hae, the Maunga Auhepa house site (Smith pp. 279-286), with its boat-shaped house with dressed curbstones, refuse deposit and pentagonal ovens, the stone-curbed boat-shaped house at Tuu-ko-ihu village (Smith pp. 287-289), the tupa of Hiramoko, both upper and lower levels (Mulloy pp. 323-329), and doubtless also the floor of the standing corbelled stone house investigated at Orongo (Ferdon pp. 234, 247-248). The cultural inventory of these sites is in range very similar : besides mataa, all sites, except Orongo, produced adzes and, except Orongo and Tuu-ko-ihu, abrading stones. Various forms of obsidian scraper (side, multi-edged, miscellaneous) were present at all sites except Orongo and perhaps the tupa. Drills or perforators were absent only from Orongo, chisels from Orongo, Tuu-ko-ihu and the tupa. Some fish hooks were found at all sites except Tuu-ko-ihu and Orongo, but only the former lacked bone needles. Worked human bone was present everywhere except Tuu-ko-ihu and possibly Orongo. Shell food refuse is reported from all the sites, birdbone (including chicken) from all except Maunga Auhepa, fishbone from all except Maunga Auhepa and Orongo. Less well represented artifacts include edge ground saws or knives (Maunga Auhepa and the tupa), stone bowls (Maunga Auhepa and Tuu-ko-ihu), a stone</page><page sequence="24">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 61 pillow and tattooing combs (Orongo) and pentagonal ovens (Maunga Auhepa and Tuu-ko-ihu). It is difficult to attribute to period the lower levels at Puapau and O-hae caves (cf. Smith p. 271). At the former the excavator distinguishes an upper from a lower level on the basis of the stratigraphic distribution of European items (Smith pp. 259-260) ; at the latter an arbitrary division was made at the level of the footing of an enclosing wall built during the occupation of the cave. Both divisions were found to correspond well with the vertical distribution of mataa, which occurred in quantity above and hardly at all below. Apart from the mataa, however, (and the European items), the context of the lower levels at both sites does not differ appreciably from that of the upper levels. A quite different picture is presented by excavations at two thick-walled stone circular dwellings with storage cists within the wall and pit ovens (at one site inside, at the other outside the house) not of pentagonal type (site E2, Skj√≤lsvold pp. 298-303, site E5, Ferdon pp. 306-311). As Skj√≤lsvold notes (p. 302), many of the features accompanying the Late Period habitation sites described above are lacking : bone needles, fishhooks, worked bone of any kind, shell and fish waste. Food remains were indeed found: at site E2 in the form of charred sugar cane, sweet potato and pieces of nut-like fruit round the interior hearth and large quantities of chicken bones in the wall cist (Skj√≤lsvold p. 297) ; at site E5, bones from the external rubbish heap are reported as under analysis (Ferdon p. 308). Finds at site E2 comprised a large number of obsidian scrapers of various kinds and of obsidian chips with use fracture, some adzes and adze-like tools, a rubbing stone and a small obsidian disc of a type found in not very secure contexts at Vinapu and O-hae. Site E5 produced two adze fragments, obsidian tools described as perforators (seven in number) and a graver, and 16 obsidian scrapers of various kinds. In addition Ferdon describes (p. 309) as tanged knife blades two obsidian implements of a type classified as type A scrapers by Skj√≤lsvold at site E2 (Skj√≤lsvold p. 298, 25 specimens). In architecture and artifacts sites E2 and E5 are obviously closely related. At both sites there was an absence of European items and mataa occurred only in the very top of the deposits : at E2 five just beneath the turf (Skj√≤lsvold p. 297), at E5 a number on the surface and a fragment in the top 20 cms. of the rubbish heap (depth 85 cms.). A radiocarbon date of ad 1526 ¬± 100 was obtained from charcoal collected beneath a layer of stone slabs inside the hearth at the centre of house E2 (Skj√≤lsvold p. 303, Smith p. 394). Though Skj√≤lsvold is surely wrong in presuming that the dated charcoal derives from one of the last times the hearth was in use (his description p. 297 and sections Figure 79 show a great deal of charcoal above as well as below the layer of stones), the date itself is an acceptable one in the light of the evidence. In the excavators' terms it falls within the Middle Period of ahu construction. If the artifacts from sites E2 and E5 represent Middle Period assemblages, their comparison with artifacts of the Late Period is obviously of importance for</page><page sequence="25">62 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND reconstructing the course of Easter Island culture history. Unfortunately only in terms of obsidian flake tools and adzes can this be done, since these are all the relevant assemblages have in common. Apart from Ferdon's summary remarks at the conclusion of the volume (pp. 531, 533), no such comparison is attempted and for reasons already elaborated it is impossible for the reader to make it. The obsidian flake tools might be susceptible of such analysis : Ferdon's suggestion that the tanged knife blade of sites E2 and E5 is the prototype of the Late Period mataa (p. 310) is the only comparative statement made. For what it is worth we may note that adzes of Sanchez and Figueroa type 2 A occur both at sites E2 (Skj√≤lsvold p. 302) and E5 (Ferdon p. 310) and at the Late Period sites Puapau (Smith p. 262) O-hae (Smith p. 268), Maunga Auhepa (Smith p. 284), and Tuu-ko-ihu (Smith p. 289). So far then the evidence of the artifacts is insufficient to sustain or indeed refute a claim (cf. Heyerdahl p. 497) for the existence in Easter Island by the Late Period of two distinct population groups. Nor, in terms of the present volume, can the artifactual evidence be taken very much further. Yet if Easter Island culture history springs from diverse cultural origins as Heyerdahl and some of his colleagues claim, the fact should be reflected in the artifacts as much as it is alleged to be in temple architecture and statuary. HeyerdahTs concern in the chapter he con- tributes on surface artifacts is precisely to make this point (pp. 481-489). Of the material dealt with by him I intend to discuss in detail only the fishhook since this is the sole articraft, in the absence of the Sanchez-Figueroa survey of the adzes, for which anything like a reasonable series is described from Easter Island and adequate comparative material exists outside. Easter Island fishhooks fall into two major classes : one-piece and two-piece. I use these terms in the sense of Emory (Emory et al, 1959, p. 7), the two-piece hook being essentially a one-piece hook made in two pieces. Heyerdahl (p. 427) is wrong to claim that the two-piece hook on Easter Island is quite unrelated to the one-piece hook and " one more element in the complex local culture pattern that set Easter Island apart from the general trend in historic Polynesia ". Two- piece hooks as defined above are well-documented from Hawaii (Emory et al. 1950, e.g. Figure 4) and New Zealand (Golson 1959, pp. 42, 50). The one-piece hooks are rendered in stone (rarely) and bone. Though Heyerdahl asserts (p. 415) that the stone hook is unknown elsewhere in Polynesia, he later (pp. 416, fn. 20, 485) somewhat modifies this view in favour of the Chatham Islands. He also (p. 416, fn. 20) admits the possibility of stone fishhooks being recognized in unpublished collections of Pitcairn material in New Zealand museums, in view of the existence in the Otago Museum of a single example labelled Pitcairn though its provenance was doubted by M√©traux. Green (1959) has now put on record one complete and some unfinished stone fishhooks from Pitcairn in New Zealand collections, as well as a finished example in the Fiji Museum. These occurrences, and the fact that Easter Island stone hooks are typologically faithful to Polynesian forms in bone and shell (see Aneli 1955, Figure 8 and cf.</page><page sequence="26">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 63 Heyerdahl, Figures 102-104, Figure 1 a and b here) make it unnecessary to look outside Polynesia (for example to the Santa Barbara region of California, cf. Heyerdahl p. 485) for the source of Easter Island hooks in basalt. One-piece bone hooks exist in a number of forms. Of them Heyerdahl says (pp. 485-486) they " may be segregated into a variety of types according to the shape of the head with associated binding constrictions, the presence or absence of a barb, the presence of a straight, angular, or curved shank, the ratio between the width of the bend and the height of the point, and the presence of a straight or incurved point ". Unfortunately such a praiseworthy analysis is in fact in this volume not attempted. Had it been, the rather loose comparative remarks offered by Heyerdahl on p. 486 could not have been made. The essence of this section is that forms of one-piece hook related to those found on Easter Island are widely distributed in bone and shell in Polynesia but (quoting Aneli, 1955) do not occur in Indonesia or South East Asia ; that (again after Aneli) U-shaped hooks appear in Japan and North East Asia, but not circular ones ; that U-shaped, rounded U-shaped and circular hooks occur sporadically in both North and South America with concentrations (rendered in shell) in the Santa Barbara area of California and the coast of South America from Ecuador to northern Chile, with some in bone in northern Chile ; that the tendency to see a relationship between the circular shell hooks of South America and Polynesia is validated by the line attachment device of notches or grooves on a generally tapering shank found on some Chilean and Polynesian specimens and the recent discovery of one-piece hooks in South America " with specialized binding restrictions bringing South American specimens still closer to dominant Polynesian forms ". None of these alleged parallels is illustrated. The fact is that Easter Island one-piece fishhooks are distinctively Polynesian - whatever the ultimate source of Polynesian fishing gear may be. Figure 1 illustrates this for a number of detailed features of overall shape, point tip and shank head. Heyerdahl's discussion of Easter Island two-piece hooks (pp. 486-487) is vitiated partly by his confusion of them with bonito lure-hooks but mainly by a lack of rigour in discussing comparative material. There seems little doubt that the hooks in question are bait hooks, while so far from being a " very specialized Easter Island form ", they are in essentials duplicated by certain hooks from Hawaii (see Figure 2 here and cf. Emory et al. 1959, Plate 4 no. 12, Plate 3 nos. 3-6, 8, 9). All types of Easter Island fishhook recovered by the Heyerdahl expedition are thus seen to belong well and truly within the Polynesian tradition. It may be true " that the fishhook complex of the Andean Coast and adjacent Polynesia is too interrelated in specialized forms to be any longer considered as separate phenomena " (Heyerdahl p. 487) but this is saying little more than Aneli, who in his exhaustive monograph of 1955 concluded, as Heyerdahl himself notes (p. 487), that in one way or another the same North Pacific traditions in fishing gear were drawn on by both areas (Aneli 1955, pp. 140-144, *93&gt; 218, 243-247).</page><page sequence="27">64 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Fig. 1 EASTER ISLAND POLYNESIA ¬ß,kh y ¬© (U√† iL-.

Unfortunately, as previous discussion has made clear, this cannot altogether be done. The following hooks (of bone except where otherwise specified) are attributable to the Late Period : a stone fishhook blank from the upper zone at Puapau Cave (Smith p. 262) and a stone fishhook fragment from the Maunga Auhepa house site (Smith p. 284) ; a complete shank-barbed hook from the upper 10 cms. of the natural shelter at O-hae (Smith p. 268) and two fragments of shank-barbed hooks from the upper zone at Puapau Cave (Smith p. 263 and Plate 34 b, c, the type of Figure 1 here ; a fragment of a one-piece hook (unillustrated) from Maunga Auhepa (Smith p. 284) ; and the shaft of a two-piece hook subsequently lost and therefore not described (Smith p. 284). A type of two-piece hook which might legitimately be considered Late Period is illustrated here as Figure 2c. The hook, with original bindings, is said by Chauvet to have been collected by one of the officers of La Perouse (in 1786) (Chauvet 1935 : Plate XXX, Figure 73 ; cf. Heyerdahl p. 415). The protruding knobs at the base of point and shank, which facilitate lashing, are of interest and will be referred to below. Four of the five fishhooks found by Mulloy during excavations at the tupa of Hiramoko (p. 326) are Late Period, being found in the upper level, where European Legend to Figure 1.

Un- fortunately Mulloy does not say which of the five fishhooks this is, though his description may be interpreted as indicating the two-piece hook fragment described below. This obscurity may not be too serious since the occurrence of eight mataa in the lower level would date this to the Late Period also. However, the possibility does exist, though the disturbed condition of the site (Mulloy p. 325) would forbid any possibility of showing it, that pre-Late Period occupation had occurred there (cf. the five cms. depth of midden predating the construction of the tupa, Mulloy p. 323). The fishhooks discovered (Figure 87 j, k, i, m, p) are one almost complete shank-barbed hook (illustrated here as Figure 1 o), two fragments of rather angular U-shaped one-piece hooks, one shank fragment exhibiting an unusual snooding arrangement, and the broken shank of a two-piece hook (illustrated here as Figure 2 e) exhibiting a groove rather than a projecting knob for purposes of lashing to the point. A number of other hooks found in the lower levels at Puapau and O-hae are strictly undatable in terms of the three periods, though they should fall in the late Middle or early Late Period. From the lower zone at Puapau (Smith p. 263) come a featureless fragment and a complete U-shaped hook (Plate 34 a and Figure 1 k here). The description of this as having a point curved slightly inwards to the shank is mis- leading because of the existence of a type of truly incurved point on some Polynesian hooks (cf. Figure 1 e), including some from Easter Island (cf. Figure 1 b and f). At O-hae (Smith p. 268) a complete U-shaped hook, unillustrated but identically described, was found in the 20-30 cms. level inside the natural shelter, the level of the lowest mataa. From a depth of more than 30 cms. in the eastern enclosure outside the cave there came what is thought to be a fragment from the end of the shank of a two-piece hook. This is unillustrated and the description so unclear that it is hard to know if the knobbed variety is meant, though the references to illustrated parallels certainly suggest that it is. An interesting series of fishhooks came from amongst the burnt human bones of the crematorium in front of ahu No. 1 at Vinapu (Mulloy p. 158 and Figure 48 Legend to Figure 2.

This feature, which shows every evidence of having grown over time (Mulloy p. ioo), cannot be assigned to any of the three periods at the neighbouring ahu. A single radiocarbon date of ad 1228 ¬± 200 was obtained from charred bones. This is taken as a Middle Period date (cf. Smith p. 212), though the possibility of its being Early Period in the terms of the excavator's chronology is admitted (cf. Mulloy p. 160, Ferdon p. 531). Forty bone fishhooks were found, of which 18 proved too incomplete to be classified. Of the remaining 22, 19 are recognizably fragments of one-piece hooks. In general form these belong to the U-shaped type, one at least being rather angular (Figure 48c). Three, however, are described as being more circular in form. One of these (Figure 48 1), seems to belong to a distinctive type, of which a perfect example is shown here as Figure 1 1 (described as gambreled shank in Table 1). Point tips seem almost without exception to be missing, but straight points (Figure 48b in the volume, the type of Figure 1 g here) and truly incurved ones (Figure 48 a in the volume, Figure 1 f here) appear to have been present. Line attachment (Figure 1 p and q here) is by knob at the head of the shank in common with other Easter Island and Polynesian hooks. Three points of composite hooks were found : one (Figure 2 f) almost complete, a second (Figure 2 g) being the lower half lacking point, the third (Figure 48 e in the volume) the upper half lacking base. On the two bases the lashing device is a wide shallow groove in place of the knobs of the late type shown as Figure 2 c. All three points in this series are so straight that the shanks to which they belonged must have been much more curved than the other Easter Island examples figured (Figure 2 a, c, e). Five other bone hooks, brought in together by an Easter Islander, are thought to have been stolen from the Vinapu cremation graves (Heyerdahl p. 428). They comprise three one-piece hooks - the one shown here as Figure 1 1 (No. 826, p. 428), a slightly angular U-shaped hook with point tip missing (No. 822, p. 430 and Figure 106 u), and the point leg of a hook with straight point tip (No. 825, p. 430 and Figure 106 w) - and fragments of two points of two-piece hooks, one (No. 820, p. 437, Figure 2 d here) showing a groove at the base for lashing, the other an unillustrated piece (No. 864, p. 437) described as having a point with curvature intermediate between Figure 2 a and b here (Figure 107 b and c in the volume) (this presumably refers to the point tip and not the point leg). Table 1 summarizes, as far as the published evidence will allow, the fishhook evidence from Easter Island. If the chronology can be accepted, it shows that fishhooks in the Polynesian tradition were present in different periods of the Easter Island sequence. It also hints, though no more, that fishhooks could be important as an aid to relative dating on Easter Island. Shank-barbed hooks may prove to be late in type or popularity (cf . Ferdon p. 533), what we have called the gambreled shank hook early. Similarly, with the two-piece hooks, knobs may with the passage of time have come to dominate over grooves for purposes of lashing and straight points given way to straight shanks.</page><page sequence="32">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 69 Table i Lower Levels Vinapu Puapau and Crematorium Late Period O-hae (? late (? late Early- Middle or early or early Late Period) Middle Period) Stone one-piece hooks . . . . . .

It is possible that the single example indicated by 5 in the table is meant, but one of the hooks included in the categories indicated by 3 and 4, or a fragment not incorporated in the table, are possibilities. 6 This is an ethnological specimen collected on La P√©rouse's visit 1786. 7 The verbal description of this piece (Smith p. 268) is confusing. On balance the evidence of the fishhooks may be said to argue against any significant non-Polynesian element in Easter Island culture. Fishhooks, however, are a single item in a cultural inventory and not an indispensable one. We badly need the evidence of other items and the adzes may be very important in this regard. The most we know about their bearing on the problem is Heyerdahl's brief state- ment on the Figueroa-Sanchez adze study (p. 483) : " they conclude that Easter Island is hard to include in a geographical pattern, and that its adze complex, though with Eastern Polynesian relationships, cannot be compared satisfactorily with any particular locality. Only the Marquesas demonstrates enough similarities to suggest specific relationships . . . The House Builders In a special report (pp. 329-338) Ferdor brings together the evidence of different house types on Easter Island and speculates about their cultural implications. The house type most frequently described for Easter Island is the boat-shaped thatch house, having the appearance of an overturned canoe, with floor plan characteristically, though by no means invariably, outlined by shaped rectangular blocks or curbstones. This house was dominant at the time of the island's European discovery. A second type, confined during historic times to the cult site of Orongo</page><page sequence="33">70 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND but perhaps at one time of wider occurrence (p. 330;, is a rectangular to oval-roomed dwelling built with thick stone and earth walls and a corbelled roof, often grouped to form with its neighbours a series of contiguously walled structures. In its use of masonry, its technique of corbelling and its grouping in series, the Orongo house departs significantly from known Polynesian house types. There are, however, some features shared by it and the boat-shaped thatch house (p. 333). The interior of the Orongo house is often, because of the corbelled roof, shaped like an over- turned canoe. The doorway of the thatch house was commonly in the form of a low tunnel, related perhaps to the tunnel entrance which the Orongo house of necessity possessed because of the thickness of its walls. In both types of house non-structural doorposts of stone were at times employed. Only two further structural types need to be discussed in the present connection. One of these is the thick- walled oval to circular dwelling whose surface remains have in the modern literature been interpreted as the sites of stone- walled plant- ations (cf. Skj√≤lsvold p. 295) but whose status as houses was indicated by excavation (Skj√≤lsvold pp. 295-297, Ferdon pp. 305-308). Like the Orongo house, the thick- walled dwelling sometimes formed part of a series of contiguously walled structures of the same type. Finally there is the strange, and not very common, tall masonry tupa with its small slab-roofed chamber and low entryway. The evidence that the tupa was indeed a dwelling is not conclusive (Ferdon p. 331), and depends on historical information from Bernizet who visited the island with La Perouse in 1786 (Heyerdahl pp. 57-59, Figure 4 a-d) and the excavation by Mulloy of an inhabited cave enclosed by masonry in a tupa-like manner (pp. 323-325, Figure 86). It is Ferdon's opinion (pp. 334-335) that the masonry dwellings of Easter Island, for which no parallels are to be found in Polynesia, cannot satisfactorily be explained in terms of a local shortage of timber suitable for house construction or of any other environmental circumstance : timber and thatch houses were after all in use on Easter Island at the time of European discovery. The apparent restriction of the thick-walled circular dwelling and the tupa to the eastern part of the island, the traditional domain of the Hanau Eepe, suggests to Ferdon that these two house types belong to a distinct building tradition for which the possibility of a South American origin must be considered (pp. 335-338). The pole and thatch houses, for which a Polynesian origin is logical, might thus, in his view, be considered characteristic of the Hanau Momoko, traditionally resident in the western part of the island, and their presence throughout the whole island (proved by the wide distribution of their basalt curbstones) would be explained by the traditional victory of the Hanau Momoko over the Hanau Eepe, which is looked upon as initiating the archaeologists' Late Period. With the information we have available there is little we can do to test this hypothesis, beyond observing how badly it fits the other hypotheses of the diverse origins of Easter Island culture erected on the basis of other aspects of the data. The badness of the fit begins indeed to show with Ferdon's discussion of the origins of the Orongo house type (pp. 335-338). For him this is a non-Polynesian structure</page><page sequence="34">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 71 for which a South American origin might be considered. Yet it belongs in his view to a building tradition distinct from that of the thick-walled house for which a South American origin is also postulated and is said to be distributed in a different part of the island. The difficulty comes with the realisation that the western distribution attributed to the Orongo house focuses attention on the part of the island traditionally inhabited by the Hanau Momoko, whom, for purposes of the hypothesis with which we began, Ferdon looks upon as Polynesian (p. 336). For not very good reasons, which will be discussed in detail later, Ferdon regards the Orongo-type house as old on Easter Island, as old as the Early Period (p- 336). Yet the boat-shaped thatch house, thought by him to be of Polynesian inspiration, may also predate the Middle Period, because basalt curbstones belonging to them are found in Middle Period reconstructions of Early Period ahu walls (Smith p. 191 for Tepeu 1 and cf. Heyerdahl p. 449). Though Ferdon (p. 333) points to the resemblances between the Orongo house and the boat-shaped house, he avoids the obvious question of the cultural implications of these resemblances between two allegedly early house types, the one of presumed South American, the other of presumed Polynesian origin. Heyerdahl faces the question squarely : he interprets (p. 514) Ferdon by virtue of the above comparisons as showing that " the strange elliptical shape of the pole and thatch houses in all likelihood is derived from a corbelled masonry prototype " and suggests (p. 515) that " the transition from the boat-shaped corbelled stone house to the boat-shaped pole and thatch house took place in the Early Period, if not prior to the migration to Easter Island ". In his view the relevant migration is from the South American landmass where stone structures with corbelled roofs are known. The implication is that pole and thatch construction is in terms of cultural relationships not very decisive since " oval and rectangular houses con- structed from poles covered by a thatch is [sic] common both in Polynesia and in south-western South America, and, for this reason, may have reached Easter Island from either side of the ocean " (p. 515). The pole and thatch house ellipsoid to oval in plan was widespread in Polynesia (Suggs 1961, pp. 163-165) and has been shown to very early in the Marquesan sequence (Suggs 1961, p. 159 - Settlement and early Developmental Periods, considered as beginning c. 150 bc).3 At the same time there is no very convincing evidence that the Orongo-type house was particularly early on Easter Island. Ferdon's arguments that it was (p. 336) depend on excavations at the Orongo site itself which are interpreted as giving a Middle Period date for its presence there, and on evidence from Paymaster Thomson, who visited the island in 1886, said to record the existence of a village of Orongo-style houses on the west coast of the island in an advanced state of ruin. Thomson says of these remains (Ferdon p. 330) that " they bear unmistakable evidence of being the oldest habitations on the island ", presumably arguing from the state of the site and the fact that his guides knew nothing of it and had no 3 Sugg's information was not in print during the preparation of the Easter Island reports.</page><page sequence="35">72 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND name for the locality. The Heyerdahl expedition did not visit the site, so that even the suggestion that the houses there are of Orongo type is a supposition. Thomson's discovery, moreover, seems to be the only relevant observation causing Ferdon to suspect (p. 336) an Early Period date for the initial construction of the Orongo- style house on Easter Island (cf. Heyerdahl p. 515). Ferdon's case for the Middle Period date of the Orongo house at Orongo itself (pp. 240-243) involves fairly audacious correlation of the excavated evidence of two separate trenches and reliance on a dangerously literal interpretation of radio- carbon dates (cf. especially p. 243). In his trench 2 Ferdon plausibly interprets a hard grey-brown soil with yellow-brown soil inclusions as resulting from the preparation of the site of stone house R12-14, directly beneath the walls of which it passes. In terms of a single radiocarbon date for charcoal at the base of a pit whose subsequent infilling of loose dark grey soil is overlain by the house-site spoil, the construction of the house postdates ad 1540 ¬± 7¬∞. The house site spoil of trench 2 Ferdon equates with a stratum of hard grey-brown soil with yellow-brown soil inclusions lying between two charcoal levels in trench 1, in terms of derivation not simply from dug and redeposited subsoil (cf. p. 240) but from subsoil dug and redeposited in the process of preparing the same house site (p. 243). Consequently a date for charcoal immediately above the hard grey-brown layer of trench 1, ad 1576 i √≠oo, is looked upon as providing the terminus ante quern for the construction of stone house R12-14, for which the date of ad 1540 i 70 from trench 2 constitutes the terminus post quern. By this argument the stone house in question falls within the excavator's Middle Period. Ferdon justifies his equation of the two layers of trenches 1 and 2 in terms of the nearness of the trenches to each other (p. 243). The extreme western end of trench 2 is about 20 ft. away from and north of the extreme eastern end of trench 1 : the latter trench begins about 20 ft. west of the front wall of house R12-14 while trench 2 finishes about 18 ft. west of that wall (Figure 137). This is a fair area over which to spread spoil from the same house foundation. Unfortunately we are given no drawn section of the western extension of trench 2 by which to judge the configuration of the stratum of foundation spoil in question : immediately by the house itself it is no thicker than nine inches (Figure 68). Nor does the description of the excavation of the trench provide any clue (pp. 241-242). On the other hand the drawn section of trench 1 (Figure 67), while not very illuminating on the question of correlations with trench 2, suggests, in the presence of a dressed rectangular block of stone, that the structural history of the area is more complex than Ferdon's equations allow. Nothing in the above criticism disproves a Middle Period or even earlier date for the Orongo type of stone house. Indeed, in terms of sheer propinquity, the spoil horizon in trench 1, which must, on the basis of a consistent series of radio- carbon dates from the trench, belong to around the 16th century, could derive from the levelling of the site of stone house R22, only 1-15 feet away south-eastwards. The direct support of excavation is as lacking for this suggestion, however, as for</page><page sequence="36">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 73 Ferdon's, while we have, in Ferdon's trench 2, evidence for pit digging in the area, apparently unconnected with and prior to stone house construction, which must have contributed its quota of redeposited subsoil to the stratigraphy of the site. All this said, however, the practice of stone house construction on Easter Island and the use of the corbelled arch do constitute, as Ferdon and Heyerdahl rightly stress, problems of importance for the prehistory of the island. There is nothing immediately comparable elsewhere in Polynesia, but general parallels can be found in South America. That these parallels are too close to allow the possibility of independent evolution on Easter Island has hardly been demonstrated. After all, Polynesians in the rest of the South Pacific were not strangers to work with stone, in the form of vaults, platforms and walls. Absolute Dates for Archaeological Phases All the radiocarbon dates obtained from the expedition's work on Easter Island are listed and discussed by Smith (pp. 393-396). Only some of them bear directly on the absolute dating of the three periods into which Easter Island prehistory is divided and these are the subject of special and separate comment (Smith pp. 210- 212). Smith points out (pp. 212, 393) that relatively few dates were obtained, that in few instances could more than one sample be collected from the same stratum, that consequently a far from ideal series must be used for delimiting the culture periods, and that the dates should be viewed with caution. With these reservations the three periods are dated as follows : Late Period : c. ad 1680 - 1868 Middle Period : c. ad 1 100 - c. 1680 Early Period : before ad 400 - c. 1100 Middle and Late Periods The date of 1868 is based on the records of missionary work on the island and is adopted as marking the approximate end of burial at ahu as a common practice on Easter Island. The date of 1680 commends itself to the excavators because of the agreement between the traditional date for the final battle between Hanau Momoko and Hanau Eepe at the Poike ditch calculated by Englert on the basis of genealogies (c. ad 1680) (Smith p. 212) and the radiocarbon date for charcoal from the Poike ditch inter- preted as the product of the holocaust that collected traditions persistently describe as a feature of that battle (ad 1676 ¬± 100) (Smith pp. 212, 385-391). The con- cordance between archaeology and tradition in this particular instance is the more gratifying since some previous investigators had interpreted the ditch as a purely natural feature (cf . Smith pp. 385-386), and their explanation has been widely accepted. The point is, however, whether, all this notwithstanding, the event in question in fact marks the beginning of the Late Period of Easter Island prehistory.</page><page sequence="37">74 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Archaeologically, as we have seen, the Late Period at the ceremonial centres is characterized by the transformation of the platform ahu into an ahu of semi- pyramidal type by the laying on of a mantle of stones amongst which burials were made. At four of the five major investigated ahu the first event in this trans- formation was the overturning of Middle Period statues (Vinapu i and 2, Mulloy pp. in, 130, Hekii 1 and Tepeu 1, Smith pp. 187, 191) : the exception is the giant statue at Te-pito-te-kura which feU on top of the cobble ramp that obliterated the old step behind the platform (Smith pp. 202-203, 207). Most of the statues thus overturned could not be reused and Mulloy argues (pp. 111-112) that political conditions were unfavourable for them being replaced. Native traditions and historical information are both said to testily to prolonged hostilities, the former specifically categorizing the epoch as the " statue-overthrowing time " (Heyerdahl p. 39). Support is lent to the general picture of political unrest by the large numbers of mataa found in Late Period contexts. However, the claim that the battle at the Poike ditch inaugurated this period depends upon a particular and selective interpretation of the extant traditions. By this, on the one hand the Hanau Eepe, who are said to have been virtually annihilated at the battle, are accepted as the sole fabricators of the statues (Heyerdahl PP- 37&gt; 38)&gt; on the other traditions of a period of peace and prosperity amongst the Hanau Momoko after the defeat of their enemies (Heyerdahl p. 39) are sub- sequently ignored. It is not my intention to suggest alternative interpretations of the traditional evidence : I am only concerned to emphasize how unsatisfactory the practice is of using traditions to make good the deficiencies of archaeological evidence in the strictly archaeological sphere. In the particular instance under discussion the traditional event that supplies the opening date for the Late Period is external to the events at the ahu in terms of which the Late Period is defined. The records of the earliest European visitors to Easter Island should not, of course, be expected to give anything like a complete picture of contemporary conditions, but it may be significant that Roggeveen in 1722 and Gonzalez in 1770 make no reference to statues overturned (cf. Heyerdahl pp. 45-50). This circumstance is first recorded during Cook's visit of 1774 (cf. Heyerdahl p. 55 - Mulloy speculates p. in that the earlier visitors may have overlooked examples). The only internal date we have from the ahu excavations is not helpful : charcoal from the Middle Period ramp surface at Vinapu 1 is dated ad 1837+100-200 (Smith p. 394). Mulloy comments (p. 97) that it could postdate the fall of the statues but certainly preceded the accumulation of many stones, at least at that particular spot. No help in the absolute dating of the Late Period is to be derived from the mataa, since these are only dated themselves at the sites where they occur in association with European trade items. The fact that excavation at the alleged battle site at Poike's ditch produced three slingstones but no mataa (Smith p. 390) may, with other indications reviewed above, support a later date for the beginning of the Late Period than the c. ad 1680 suggested on the basis of that site. The first unequivocal references to mataa in</page><page sequence="38">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 75 the literature of European discovery are those from Cook's visit in 1774 (cf.Heyer- dahl p. 52, Smith p. 270), though the Spaniards in 1770 may have been describing them (cf. Heyerdahl p. 49). Middle and Early Periods The general date for the end of the Early and beginning of the Middle Period, c. ad 1100, is arrived at by taking a point between the earliest date from Middle Period contexts and the latest one from the Early Period (Smith p. 212). The Middle Period date in question is from a sample excavated not at an ahu but at a mound of quarry refuse resulting from the making of statues at Rano Raraku. The use made of the date is legitimate, since the available evidence is that the platform statues of Rano Raraku tuff belong to the Middle Period, while possibly Early Period pieces are not made exclusively of that material. However, the date itself, ad 1206 ¬± 250, is unsatisfactory for technical reasons : it was adjudged by the laboratory inadequate for accurate ageing (Smith p. 394). It comes from three metres deep in a trench excavated to a depth of three and a half to four metres across a rubble mound on the southern side of Rano Raraku (Skj√≤lsvold p. 343) considered to belong to the earlier of two " belts " of quarry refuse (Skj√≤lsvold p. 342). The charcoal had been crushed to powder under the great weight of debris above and the sample to be dated was thus impure. A more satisfactory sample, taken at a depth of 35-50 cms. in the same trench, was dated ad 1476 i 100 (Skj√≤lsvold p. 343, Smith p. 394). There are few other dates which bear directly on the Middle Period. At Vinapu 1 Mulloy found charcoal lying in a very slight depression on the surface of the Early Period ramp and covered over by the Middle Period ramp (p. 99). Though he admits that the fire could have been lit at any time after the construction of the first ramp, his opinion is (p. 160) that it marks the occasion of the building of the second ramp. The date is ad 1516 ¬± 100 (cf. Smith p. 394). Two dates for material from grave 2 at Tepeu 1, a communal tomb in the step behind the platform, with strong claim, as we have seen above, to be pre-Late Period, are in conflict (Smith pp. 193-212, 394-395). Totora reeds beneath an extended skeleton and separating it from the disturbed remains of eight others gave a date of ad 318 ¬± 250, (" Early Period "). A sample of human bones on the other hand was dated ad 1629 ¬± 150 (" Middle Period "). A check date on a sample of modern tot ara reeds gave no indication of the unreliability of the plant as a dating medium. Smith, however, rejects the earlier and accepts the later date, on grounds of the occurrence of cist burial on other ahu of the Middle Period (Smith p. 193), in the inland steps or terraces (Smith p. 212). Strictly speaking this is an inadmissable argument, since only at Tepeu 1 were cist graves found in the step behind the platform at all, and of all the cist graves found anywhere on any ahu the Tepeu step cists are the only examples in a reasonably definite pre-Late Period context. The term pre-Late Period is used with reason because, by one interpretation of</page><page sequence="39">76 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND the structural history of Tepeu i, the cists in question could be Early Period. With the Early Period chronology accepted by the excavators, the early date of ad 318 ¬± 250 is not, at first blush, at variance. Indeed, varying his argument, Smith (p. 395) rejects the early date because of the lack of evidence for cist burial in the Early Period at Vinapu, not on grounds of its general unacceptability as a date. Before we pursue the question of Middle Period chronology further, the dating of the Early Period must claim our attention. There are two dates only relevant to the discussion, neither of them directly from an unequivocal Early Period ahu context, both accepted as Early Period by reason of their antiquity in comparison with other dates. The later of the two, ad 857 ¬± 200, is used by Smith (p. 212) in conjunction with the earlier of the two dates from Rano Raraku to determine the approximate time boundary between the Early and the Middle Periods. It comes from the charcoal of a fire lit on sloping ground without benefit of a prepared pit beneath the south wall of the plaza at Vinapu 2. Mulloy (p. 118) considers that, to have survived, the charcoal must have been buried almost immediately by the embank- ment. However, the association of the date is with the embankment and not the ahu, as Mulloy admits (p. 160). There is no archaeological evidence of the phase of Vinapu 2 history to which the plaza wall properly belongs, and its attribution to the Early Period is made simply because of the earliness of the associated date (Mulloy p. 121, cf. Smith pp. 394, 395). The earlier of the two dates appertaining to the Early Period is ad 386 ¬± 100 (Smith p. 394). It comes from wood charcoal on and in the top of the ground surface below the mound associated with the Poike ditch and, as with the charcoal beneath the plaza wall at Vinapu 2, is considered only shortly to antedate the construction of the mound which sealed it in (p. 391). It is therefore considered as significant evidence for organised human activity on Easter Island towards the end of the 4th century ad (Smith p. 212). Obviously it does not directly date any stage of ahu construction, but since the date from charcoal underneath the plaza wall of Vinapu 2 is ad 857 ¬± 200 and the tendency of the excavators is to look upon Vinapu 1 as antedating Vinapu 2, the date of ad 386 ¬± 100 from the Poike mound can be comfortably accommodated in the three period scheme and regarded as marking an early stage of the Early Period. Smith's initial hesitation about so doing is not on this score. It is prompted by the tremendous disparity between the dates for charcoal beneath the mound (ad 386 i 100) and charcoal in the ditch (ad 1676 i 100) of a structure which traditionally was built to meet a particular military need and almost immediately fulfilled it (Smith pp. 385, 391). Smith (p. 391) admits the possibility of laboratory error in respect of the early date. From Smith's description (p. 388) of similar deposits of carbon to that from which the sample was taken, exposed by gullying at widely scattered intervals along the Poike embankment, it would appear that the collection of check samples for so important a date should not be difficult.</page><page sequence="40">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 77 This would be highly desirable in view of the fact that there are some archae- ological grounds, overlooked by the excavators, for mistrusting the Poike dating. These rest in the discovery, during the excavation of the trench across the Poike complex, of two identical slingstones, one in the thick layer of burned material in the ditch, dated ad 1676 i 100, the other somewhere (not exactly specified) in the mound, dated by the charcoal beneath it ad 386 ¬± 100 (Smith p. 390). It is as easy to believe that the dating is in error as that slingstones of exactly the same form, cylindrical specimens of vesicular lava with a shallow depression at one end, should have persisted over a period of about 1300 years. The balance of the evidence suggests that the earlier date is more likely to be in error than the later one : the agreement of archaeology and tradition on the artificial nature of the Poike feature encourages belief in the lateness of its role in Easter Island history as suggested by the substance and indeed the very existence of relevant traditions. At the same time the date of ad 386 ¬± 100 is an isolated one in the general context of Easter Island radiocarbon dates, with the exception, of course, of that of ad 318 i 250 from Tepeu 1 which the excavator does not accept. Since there are objections to both these early dates, the Easter Island sequence may be considered effectively to start with the date of ad 857 ¬± 200 for the plaza wall at Vinapu 2. This is admittedly only a single date and one that only very circumstantially dates the Early Period structure at Vinapu 2, It is a credible date, however, if we accept the argument advanced previously that Vinapu 2 in fact predates Vinapu 1 and not, as the excavators have it (Mulloy pp. 96, 105, 115, tentatively, Heyerdahl p. 501, definitely), the reverse. The date of ad 1516 ¬± 100, interpreted as marking the beginning of the Middle Period at Vinapu 1, looks late if the ahu in fact predates ad 857 (cf. Smith p. 395). If ad 857 becomes, instead of a late point in the Early Period, an early or at least, (remembering the two fourth century dates), a middle one, the Middle Period date at Vinapu 1 falls more easily into place. There is no conflict between the suggested reinterpretation and the other dates from apparent Middle Period contexts at the Rano Raraku quarries. Ironically enough this reinterpretation renders more plausible the early date of ad 318^250 from totora reeds in grave 2 at Tepeu 1, which the excavator himself rejects in favour of the date of ad 1629 ¬± 150 from a bone sample from the same grave. Structurally, as we have seen, grave 2 at Tepeu 1 could belong to the Early Period of the ahu and architecturally Tepeu 1 has much in common in the Early Period with Vinapu 2 which, it has been suggested, stands towards the beginning of ahu architectural development. Smith (p. 195) specifically remarks on the resemblance of Tepeu 1 to the marae of Toa-marora on Timoe Island near Mangareva. Tepeu 1 therefore might provide the vital evidence for the affiliations of Easter Island religious structures. These speculations are based upon the mere manipulation of a few radiocarbon dates of doubtful value. What does more reliably emerge from this review of the</page><page sequence="41">yS THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND radiocarbon dating evidence for Easter Island prehistory is the possibility that the dating of the three periods by the excavators is too old. Smith (p. 216) rightly makes the point that the histories of individual ahu may differ in detail from the generalized development represented in the three archae- ological periods. However, the overall pattern is present so consistently at the investigated structures that there need be little doubt but that the three periods are reflections of widespread events in Easter Island culture history. How applicable the scheme is to areas of Easter Island prehistory beyond the temple structures which provide its data is much more open to question. So few artifacts were found during the ahu investigations that other sites reported on can be assigned to period only by way of radiocarbon dates. Unfortunately the investigation of habitation sites did not advance far enough for sequences in terms of artifacts or domestic architecture to be possible. Summary and Conclusions The purpose of the introductory section of this paper was to show that the changes in ahu architecture and function which provide a useful if limited frame- work for the periodisation of Easter Island prehistory need not be ascribed to the arrival of different populations on the island. This thesis has been argued in terms of certain factors of continuity throughout ahu history. As between Early and Middle Period ahu, there is general continuity of ceremonial site and ground plan and some continuity in less general features like associated plazas and purely seaward orientation of the fagade of the central plat- form. It is also evident that the skills exhibited by the builders of the Early Period in lifting, dressing and fitting large blocks of stone were in the possession of the builders of the Middle Period though directed to different ends, the erection of statues and preparation of base plates for them. Further parallels may be found to exist when aspects of the Early Period ahu at present hardly known are clarified by future work. Between the ahu of the Middle and Late Periods there is marked continuity of ceremonial site and less obvious continuity of burial practice. Burial, mainly perhaps of cremated remains, was made in the immediate vicinity of the ahu in the Middle Period, maybe earlier. The practice continued into the Late Period, though this period is essentially characterized by the transformation of the ahu itself into a burial site, with unburnt bones laid in regular cists in the ahu or in bundles amongst the stones that were piled up over it. There is some evidence for cist burial on one ahu (Tepeu 1) in the Middle Period, if not earlier, and for cremation on another (Hekii 1) in either the Middle or the Late Period. It is impossible to reconstruct ahu history in detail because we are very badly informed about its earliest stages. The excavators suggest that the Early Period platform did not carry statues and that the masonry repairs and reconstructions of Early Period structures by Middle Period builders were designed to fit the ahu platform to support statuary. The demolition of statues in the Late Period is</page><page sequence="42">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 79 described in local traditions as a feature of late warfare on Easter Island. The Late Period ahu would assume some of its characteristics as a result of conditions never again being peaceful enough for the statues to be replaced. It is just possible that the two phases of statue erection postulated by the excavators for the Middle Period at Ahu Hekii I and Te-pito-te-kura constitute evidence, already within the Middle Period, for the practice of statue destruction typical of the Late Period. The excavators admit the possibility that in the Early Period statuary may have been set up in made or natural plazas to landward of the ahu. There is no evidence on this point and little enough to support the idea that there were statues in the Early Period at all. The evidence on this point consists of a stylistically deviant group of statues, two members of which were found reused in allegedly Middle Period walls at Ahu Naunau and Mai-taki-te-moa, and a rather more heterogeneous group, two members of which exhibit treatment of the eyes identical with a petroglyph at Orongo assigned to the Early Period. On the information available it seems that the first of these two groups is fairly closely related in style to the Middle Period platform statue type. However, on the whole, at this stage of our knowledge, the statues provide few useful clues as to the origins and composition of Easter Island culture, though attention has been drawn here to a possible New Zealand parallel to the Middle Period type. More helpful are the ahu themselves. Smith, with particular reference to the Early Period structures at Vinapu 2 and Tepeu 1, makes three important points of comparison between Easter Island ahu and marae in central Polynesia : the presence of the large elongate slabs set on end in the seaward fagade of the platform at the two ahu, associated at Tepeu 1 with a step behind the platform and at Vinapu 2 with an enclosed court behind the ahu as a whole. The platform step at Tepeu 1 may admittedly be Middle Period in origin, not part of the Early Period structure. Of the two possibilities, the writer inclines to the latter, because of the presence above the step of an apparently intact line of chamfered slabs of a type characteristic at the two Vinapu ahu of the Early Period and because of the hint provided by the level pavement discovered beneath the Middle Period ramp at Vinapu 2. The enclosed plaza at Vinapu 2 is attributed to the Early Period structure by the sole evidence of a single radiocarbon date. With respect to the seaward facade at Vinapu 2 and Tepeu 1, of which elongate slabs set on end are a feature, the problem concerns the place of this style of ahu construction in the overall Early Period development of ahu architecture on Easter Island. According to Heyerdahl it must be a late place. Vinapu 1, the masterpiece of Easter Island construction in stone, with its large basalt slabs set with long axes horizontal, prepared on all edges to make perfect fit with neighbouring slabs, and uniformly dressed on the outer surface, is said to be an earlier foundation than Vinapu 2 with its large slabs set with long axes vertical, fitted by selection rather than preparation, and largely undressed on the outer surface. By this inter- pretation Easter Island temple architecture would be marked by a progressive deterioration in masonry technique from an original standard so developed and</page><page sequence="43">8o THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND specialized that it must have beer? an importation from an outside source. For Heyerdahl this source cannot be in Polynesia, where no masonry style of comparable evolution is found, and must be in South America, where the pre-Inca masonry of the Cuzco Valley in Peru commends itself. We have argued not only that Mulloy's arguments from topography for Vinapu i being older than Vinapu 2 are inconclusive but also that some indication exists that in fact Vinapu 2 is older than Vinapu 1. This consists in the presence of a chamfered slab which Mulloy suggests, in passing, may have come from the Early Period platform at Vinapu 2 in a context at Vinapu 1 which we have concluded is an Early Period one. This is obviously a point of major importance and badly in need of confirmation. It has been suggested that much better sense is made of the late (and admittedly single) radiocarbon dating for the beginning of the Middle Period at Vinapu 1, ad 1516 ¬± 100, if the Early Period at that ahu starts after and not before ad 857 ¬± 200, a second admittedly single date, which is accepted as marking the beginning of the Early Period at Vinapu 2. If the proposed inversion of the sequence of Early Period ahu building at Vinapu is admitted, that is if we make Vinapu 2 earlier than Vinapu 1, we place earliest in the architectural sequence that type of Early Period ahu with closest resemblances in form and execution to Polynesian marae. Furthermore we then allow time and opportunity for the superlative techniques exhibited by a structure like Vinapu 1 to be developed in Easter Island from the skills imported by the original Polynesian settlers and exemplified in a structure like Vinapu 2. Since we have already concluded that the further history of the ahu on Easter Island need not imply the advent of different populations, it follows that Easter Island culture history, read in terms of the form and fortunes of its temples, is Polynesian throughout. Oblique support is lent to this hypothesis by the artifactual evidence recovered by the Easter Island excavations. It is not easy to fit the artifacts into the three period framework established at the ahu partly because the ahu excavations produced few of them, partly because, as might be expected, a different range of artifacts was found at habitation and at ceremonial sites. The presence of mataa in quantity, and also of European items, has been used to assign certain assemblages from living sites to the Late Period, the assemblages in question being very similar in composition. Two related assemblages, from round houses belonging by the evidence of a single radiocarbon date (ad 1526 ¬ø 100) to the Middle Period, are quite markedly different. The reason for the difference is at present quite unknown. Despite these particular difficulties, we may perhaps with safety accept the artifacts described in the volume as reflecting the totality of cultural influences at work in Easter Island prehistory. If so, we may simply note Duff's opinion (1964, p. 80) that they " represent the expected assemblage of categories of objects of stone and bone, all thoroughly familiar within the context of East Polynesian material culture . . . ". More specifically we have concluded that the excavated</page><page sequence="44">THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND 81 fishhooks are securely within the Polynesian tradition. Not only are these present in fair quantity but, if we accept the single radiocarbon date for the crematorium at Vinapu i (ad 1228 i 200), they are also distributed between different segments of the Easter Island sequence. There are slight indications that some types of hook will prove with future work to have chronological value. This simple view of Easter Island as an Eastern Polynesian colony begs a large number of questions. Amongst them is the important and complex problem of Easter Island houses in stone. As Ferdon rightly stresses, there are a number of apparently non-Polynesian features in domestic architecture that require explanation. Unfortunately the evidence is lacking to attempt such explanation, Ferdon's own statement being particularly unsatisfactory. A question of some importance in this connection concerns the origins of the Orongo-style stone house with corbelled roof for which Ferdon proposes a date early in the Easter Island sequence. In Ferdon's view this means that the house type cannot have been developed on the island but must have been imported from an outside and, since corbelling is not known elsewhere in Polynesia, a non-Polynesian source. We have attempted to show that the claim for the antiquity of the Orongo house is invalid on the evidence used. If the Orongo house is late, and such a view it must be admitted is supported less by evidence than lack of it, it could conceivably have evolved on Easter Island from a timber prototype. Such a prototype is available in the boat-shaped houses in use on the island at European discovery, whose antiquity there is demonstrated by the re-use of their basalt curbstones in Middle Period ahu and for which parallels exist elsewhere in Polynesia. The Orongo house and the boat-shaped house are obviously closely related but the nature of that relationship is at present obscure. Rather later dates have been suggested for the three periods of Easter Island prehistory than those accepted by the excavators, with full realisation of the difficulties involved in the dates available. The discovery of identical slingstones in the bank and the ditch fill at Poike's ditch leads us to question the validity and interpretation of the two remarkably different radiocarbon dates obtained for an archaeological feature which traditions suggest was used immediately after it was constructed. Those traditions encourage acceptance of the later date, ad 1676 ¬± 100. The absence of mataa at the site, compared with their prevalence at all other Late Period sites, is interpreted, with other factors, as suggesting that the excavators are wrong to use this date for the beginning of the Late Period. A date as late as 1750, between the Dutch discovery and the visit of Cook, might be more appropriate. Given the chronology of Pacific settlement, a date of ad 386 ¬± 100, the earlier of the two from Poike's ditch, is not inherently impossible for Easter Island : it is rejected on other grounds. There is indeed a comparably early date from a grave on the step behind the central platform at Tepeu 1, ad 318 ¬± 250, which the excavator himself rejects because it is in conflict with one of ad 1629 ¬± 150 from the same grave. Strictly speaking, in terms of what we know, and do not know, about the history of Tepeu 1, ad 318 is not totally unacceptable, since the grave from which it comes could be Early Period. Moreover, by analogy with</page><page sequence="45">82 THOR HEYERDAHL AND PREHISTORY OF EASTER ISLAND Vinapu 2, the Early Period at Tepeu 1, with its elongate slabs set up in the seaward wall with long axes vertical, would stand early in the Easter Island ahu sequence. The date of ad 857 ¬± 200 for charcoal under the plaza wall at Vinapu 2 is a single estimation and not directly associated with any phase of building at the ahu. If it is accepted as a date for the Early Period at Vinapu 2, it marks an earlier stage of the Early Period for us than it does for the excavators, since we are inclined to place the construction of Vinapu 1 after it, the excavators before. There is no very satisfactory evidence for dating the end of the Early Period and the beginning of the Middle. The samples from Middle Period contexts have dates of ad 1206 ¬± 250 (a sample from the Rano Raraku quarries judged inadequate for accurate dating), ad 1476 ¬± 100 (Rano Raraku quarries) and ad 15 16 ¬± 100 (on the Early Period ramp surface at Vinapu 1, covered by the Middle Period ramp). All three should from their context be earlier rather than later in the Middle Period. These facts and the other redatings all considered, we might propose a later date than the excavators do for the beginning of the Middle Period - say ad 1250 instead of ad 1 100 : a pure guess in both cases. Nothing has been said hitherto about the implications of the occurrence of South American flora on Easter Island, (cf. Heyerdahl pp. 519-526), especially the sweet potato, present together with sugar cane in food refuse at site E2 dated ad 1526 ¬± 100 (Skj√≤lsvold pp. 297, 303, cf. Smith p. 394). The sweet potato made its journey from South America long before this, of course, judging by its presumed time of arrival in New Zealand (14th century at latest, Green 1963, p. 57), but where it was introduced into Oceania and by what agency is quite unknown. The question of the dispersal of the sweet potato has long been of significance in the context of Polynesian culture history as a whole ; it is particularly so for those islands where it became the food crop of paramount importance. This reinterpretation of Easter Island prehistory has not gone beyond the data provided by the Heyerdahl expedition. It has shown with great clarity the areas where further information is urgently needed. These include the Early Period ahu, especially its landward features, and the whole question of dwelling sites. Excavations at Vinapu 2 and Tepeu 1 offer good prospects for investigating the beginnings of Easter Island temple architecture. Parallel work at habitation sites should also provide the artif actual evidence now lacking for a soundly based assessment of the sources and development of Easter Island culture.
