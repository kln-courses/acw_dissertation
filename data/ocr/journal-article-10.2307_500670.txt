<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY, 1948 FREDERICK JOHNSON, Editor HE vitality of American Archaeology, during the calendar year 1948 is illustrated in two important and extremely useful bibliographies. One, American Antiquity, xii, 1948, pp. 350-356, is classified by area and has a wide coverage of currently significant data for the western hemisphere. The second, American Anthropologist, 1, 1948, pp. 326-350, is classified and is world wide in scope. Attention may be called to American Antiquity which continued to publish numerous valuable articles. In the sec- tion "Notes and News" of this quarterly journal the details of the activities of new-world archae- ologists are set forth. May I express may grati- tude to Dr. Irving B. Rouse, Editor of American Antiquity, who has made available data which was in press at the time of writing this account. Also many correspondents have given freely of their time and information so that the data pre- sented here may be the more complete. For this I am more greatly indebted than is indicated in the acknowledgments. Perhaps one of the most important general statements concerning American Archaeology was published by Kroeber (1948). Three chapters of this important book cover practically the en- tire range of cultural history. One of the chapters is devoted to the New World. Totally different in character are two other studies. Taylor (1948) has analyzed the history of American Archaeology and out of this have come suggestions for its direction. The study has many important ideas which should be given careful attention. However, in my opinion, the lack of proper appreciation for the status of American archaeology, and also for practical considerations, during the past and at the present time, has led Taylor into untenable positions which, coupled with a kind of cynicism destroys much of the value of the endeavor. The second work (Gladwin, 1947) would not be worth men- tioning if it were not for its wide distribution. Various reviews of this raucous and patently popular book have pointed out errors in fact, ill- advised emphasis and significant omissions or misinterpretations. (Linton, 1948; Lothrop, 1948; Steward, 1948; Willey and Newman, 1949). The River Basin Survey program of the Federal government reported in November the recording of some 1800 sites in 188 reservoir areas located in 19 states. Some 250 of these have been recommended for excavation or inten- sive testing. An effort will be made to commence excavation in high priority reservoirs during the season of 1949. The Committee on Radioactive Carbon 14 reports that the method of dating ma- terials developed by Dr. W. H. Libby and his associates promises considerable success. In testing the method, dates obtained from Egyptian specimens were within an acceptable margin of error. January, 1950 will see the end of the de- velopmental stage of the project. The Committee on the Interrelations of Pleistocene Research of the National Research Council is in a position to aid with problems best solved by the coopera- tion of geologists, archaeologists, and others. It is a pleasure to note the development of local or state archaeological societies.' Frederica de Laguna suggests that archaeology and ethnology are being closely linked. Through varying approaches we may look for a shift toward the blending of various disciplines into a study of cultural dynamics. Such is perhaps implied by Taylor (1948); compare for example, the development from Pit House to Kiva with its effect on Southwestern religious and social con- cepts. It is noted also that during a study of the Papago, Laura Thompson gleaned from the archaeological data a perspective of the stability of culture patterns through time back even to the materials from Ventana Cave. In this case archaeology aided in the understanding of the functioning of culture and even the interaction of personalities. De Laguna closes with the sug- gestion that the collaboration of archaeology and 1 A partial list, now somewhat out of date, was pub- lished in American Antiquity, xii, 1946, pp. 65-66. 286</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 287 other disciplines can throw light on problems of cultural stability and change as functions of society and personality.

Collins, working under a joint project of the National Museum of Canada and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, exca- vated an Eskimo site near Crystal II, the Air Force Base at Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island. He also made anthropometric observations on 80 adult Eskimos. Most of the artifacts from the site, and the semi-subterranean houses of stone and whale bone, belong to an early phase of the Thule culture which is quite similar to the Alaskan Thule-Punuk from Wales and St. Lawrence Island. The site had been previously occupied by Dorset Eskimo. Drs. Helge Larsen and Erik Holtved, National Museum of Denmark, and Mr. Owen E. Rye of the University of Alaska, collaborated in archaeo- logical work in the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area of Alaska. A survey of the coast between Bristol Bay and Kuskokwim Bay was made. Excavations at the site of Pawik revealed post- contact material. Between Dillingham and Good- news Bay 17 previously unknown sites were located. Some 990 sites near Platinum character- ized by slate implements and Eskimo pottery seem to have been late-prehistoric. The modern village of Platinum is built on an earlier site of which two undisturbed houses produced over 400 stone implements of Ipiutak type. A site at Chagvan Bay contained a culture similar to that at Platinum except that the chipped implements were coarser and the pottery was finer than the ordinary Eskimo type-some pots were deco- rated by check stamping. Dr. Louis Giddings, University of Alaska, ex- cavated two important sites on Cape Denbigh. On one of these material from the upper levels dates from about 1600 A.D. The lowest strata yielded remains closely akin to the early Punuk of St. Lawrence Island and scattered ivories suggestive of Old Bering Sea. At the second site, Early Punuk materials were found. Below these were Ipiutak stone types, Dorset-like arrow- points, and pottery. This pottery, unlike any found before 1948, is very thin and hard and is completely covered outside with minute check stamping or vertical striations. Below this pot- tery and beneath a layer of sterile sandy clay there was discovered a stone culture consisting of minutely retouched lamellar flakes and their derivatives. In addition abundant tree ring ma- terial was collected from both sites. The Andover-Harvard Yukon Expedition, under Frederick Johnson and Hugh M. Raup, concentrated on the area in Southwestern Yukon Territory which includes the Shakwak Valley and Kluane Lake. Evidence of human occupa- tion beginning about 2500 B.c. found first in 1944 was corroborated and expanded by the excava- tion of about 20 sites. Collaborative botanical and geological data not only served to date the occupation but brought to light physiographic changes and a succession of vegetation types. Prairies, on which the early people lived, de- veloped out of the early post-glacial vegetation and, in comparatively recent times, were suc- ceeded by the present forests which are made up almost exclusively of white spruce. The Peabody Museum Aleutian expedition of Harvard University conducted an integrated pro- gram including physical anthropology, medicine, 2 Information from Frederica de Laguna is grate- fully acknowledged.</page><page sequence="3">288 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY dentistry, linguistics, archaeology, and ethnol- ogy. It was directed by William S. Laughlin. Ab- stracts of reports by the specialists will be pub- lished in a collaborative volume by the Pea- body Museum. Archaeological work included identification of lower "Pre-Aleut" and upper "Aleut" strata. At present the evidence seems to bear out the thesis that the Aleuts are relatively late comers to the Aleutian Island. Dr. Douglas Leechman, National Museum of Canada, made an archaeological survey in com- pany with amateur archaeologists between Winnipeg and Edmonton, Alberta. In the south- ern Yukon he found a number of sites he be- lieves are similar to those discovered by Freder- ick Johnson and Hugh M. Raup. THE NORTHEAST Space does not permit adequate notice of the wealth of detail which was generously supplied by Dr. William A. Ritchie. Fortunately a full account will appear in American Antiquity. Edward and Murry Rogers returned from their reconnaissance of the region about Lake Mistas- sini, Province of Quebec, with a second large col- lection from the surface and from important test excavations on many sites. The expedition was financed by the Peabody Foundation and the Viking Fund. For an account of their previ- ous work see Rogers, 1948, and Johnson, 1948. The material is important for it is evidence of the existence of a percussion industry analogous to the Palaeolithic and it may have existed in the region for a long time. Douglas S. Byers, Peabody Foundation, and Wendell S. Hadlock, Robert Abbe Museum, in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania Summer School, continued excavations at Wasp Island near Ellsworth, Maine. Stratification proved a previously observed sequence beginning with slate spear, adzes, gouges, and certain types of chipped tools. Upper levels produced a progres- sion of pottery and stone artifacts. The Warren K. Moorehead Chapter of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society continued excavation of the Titicut Site in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The site has produced material from several horizons beginning at an early date and lasting to Historic times. Frederick Johnson and Maurice Robbins are engaged in completing the report. Edward S. Deevey has published an account of his study of the pollen from the site at Grassy Island. (Deevey, 1948). During the summer excavations were carried out about Newport Tower under the auspices of the Pea- body Museum, Harvard, and various groups in Newport, Rhode Island. To date only scrappy evidence of Colonial occupation has come to light. In Connecticut, under the direction of Irving B. Rouse, Yale University students and the Archaeological Society of Connecticut have ex- cavated a shell heap the upper levels of which were deposited during the 17th century. Other projects include excavations in East Killingly and Moosup Pond. Some of the artifacts ob- tained may be comparable to the early material Greenman includes in the George Lake Culture in Ontario. Excavations in the Ragged Moun- tain rock shelter by W. S. Fowler, Richard Adams, and Rouse brought to light two layers in the refuse in the combined steatite quarry and camp site. The lower layer is preceramic and the upper includes late types of pottery. Carlyle Smith's publication (1947) of the results of his study of materials from New York and Long Island is an important contribution. His chrono- logical sequence is probably applicable over a wide region but details will bring out distinct areas, some of which may, in a sense, differ be- cause of conservatism or partial geographic isolation. The Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences sent a party under the direction of W. A. Ritchie to the Bay of Quinte, Trent Waterway, and Rice Lake, Ontario. In the former region one of several annular earth and stone mounds in- cluded a burial containing potsherds of a kind found in Point Peninsula sites in New York. A burial site located near Picton produced eleven graves exhibiting a complex strikingly similar to the Glacial Kame Culture of Michigan and Ohio but which included some similarities to the Middlesex Culture of the Northeast. On the Trent river there were camp sites of Laurentian type with the addition of Early Middle Wood- land pottery types. On Sugar Island, in Rice Lake, a stratified site yielded a progression of pottery types parallelling that found in New York. All these excavations reveal important data some details of which may document the diffusion of culture northward from New York</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 289 state centers during specific periods. In New York State important excavations on an early historic Seneca Indian village site were carried on by members of the New York State Archaeological Association. Iroquois problems were attacked by the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology. Mr. Kenneth E. Kidd excavated a Huron Indian ossuary con- taining at least 1000 individual skeletons in Tiny Township, Simcoe County, Ontario. It is probable that this ossuary was described by Father Jean de Brebeuf in the Jesuit Relation for 1636. T. F. MacIllwraith, Department of An- thropology, University of Toronto, excavated a small, possibly historic Huron village site in Simcoe County, Ontario. J. Norman Emerson of the same Department and a large group of stu- dents excavated a palisaded site on Black Creek, north of Toronto. The identity of the materials is in doubt at present, conceivably it is Seneca. John Witthoft, Pennsylvania Historical Com- mission, excavated two sites which will clarify ideas concerning prehistory in the upper Susque- hanna Valley. The Castle Creek and Historic Andaste remains in cache pits lead him to note "apparently we have something like the Iroquois settlement for Owasco here with flood plain vil- lage sites paired with cache areas on high, ground..... " Witthoft also excavated a village site of Late Woodland period at South Towanda where the chronological relationship of several components was determined. His archaeological survey of the lower Susquehannah Valley has led him to postulate that the Susquehannah Indians were intrusive from the upper valley displacing an historic phase of the Shenk's Ferry Focus. The latter is preceded by the Clempson Island Focus, perhaps the initial mani- festation of Late Woodland in the area. Clemp- son Island material bears some relationship to Owasco further north and to the Moyane, Maryland materials and ultimately to historic Powhatan. A University of Pennsylvania expedition oper- ating under a grant from the Indiana Historical Society excavated a Lenape site near Lewis, Delaware, and in addition explored an historic Iroquois cemetery and a Munsee Village site. In northern New Jersey, Dr. Lewis M. Hag- gerty discovered a most important site. The eleven graves opened so far link the remains to the Middlesex Focus of the Vine Valley Aspect of New York. Dorothy Cross, New Jersey State Museum, directed excavations of three contact sites and a group burial containing seven flexed skeletons.

NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY During the spring the University of Michigan excavated at the Snyder site in Calhoun County, Illinois. This resulted in confirmation of the de- velopmental sequence within Illinois Hopewell and furnished additional data concerning this culture. During the summer a village site on the west bank of the St. Joseph River near Bu- chanan, Michigan, was excavated by the same organization under the direction of James B. Griffin and Albert C. Spaulding. Pottery re- covered is predominately Late Woodland but Blue Island, Fisher, and western Iroquois-like sherds were present. The site may have been occupied by the Miami Indians of the late seventeenth century. Some testing was done on a Hopewell site from which John Birsell had previ- ously recovered three fluted blades. Surveys of local collections brought to light a score or so of these blades and a number of Pinto Basin points. Emerson F. Greenman, University of Michi- gan, with the help of students, excavated at Killarney, Ontario. They discovered four more specimens in water laid gravels some 56 feet above modern Lake Huron. It is suggested that these types had developed out of those classified as George Lake I. The excavation of two mounds in a group near Spring Valley, southeastern Minnesota, produced multiple burials, a characteristic, though not an exclusive one, of the Mille Lacs Aspect (Sioux) of the Woodland Pattern. On a mound group near Zimmerman, east central area, the largest mound was discovered to be a cumulative one containing one or more secondary burials in each level. These consisted of bones from one to six individuals and rare grave goods. Also found was a remarkable cache of animal bones con- sisting, with few exceptions, of the skulls and especially the mandibles and teeth of the black bear. A prehistoric village at the modern Chippewa Indian village at Nett Lake, northeastern Minnesota, produced an unusual amount of pottery identified as Laurel (Rainy River As- pect) and Black Duck (Headwaters Lake As- pect) sherds. Village sites near Granite Falls and Hanley Falls, in southeastern Minnesota, were found to have sherds decorated with trailed line motifs of the Cambria type (Mississippi) and others were distinctly of Plains types. A site on Prairie Island near Red Wing belongs to the Oneota Aspect and this extends the distribution of the Aspect considerably farther north than hitherto known. The pottery resembles that of the Blue Earth Focus, centered south of Man- kato, more closely than it does the Orr Focus material which is common along the Missis- sippi near the Minnesota-Iowa line. Eighteen students from Beloit College and the University of Michigan conducted the first field research of the Wisconsin Archaeological Survey. (The organization of the Survey was announced in American Antiquity, xiii, 1948, pp. 348-349.) The party was directed by Moreau Maxwell and Charles W. Rowe, the latter from St. Lawrence College. At Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin, a large conical mound, two small conical mounds, and an effigy mound were opened. They had been built either by an Upper Mississippi people or a group succeeding them. No goods were found with the burials so the relative dating was estab- lished from the midden material incorporated in the mounds. In addition, trenches were dug in an extensive Orr Focus village. Mr. Andrew Whiteford of Beloit College excavated a large burial pit on Lake Monona. Until laboratory analysis is completed, identification of this site as Trempeleau Focus is tentative. The University of Wisconsin Extension Divi- sion offered courses in Anthropology and at some Extension Centers this included elementary work in field archaeology. One excavation by this or- ganization had negative results, unfortunately. A second excavation in one of three unreported mounds yielded a Folsom point from a layer containing Early Woodland pottery and quartz- ite projectile points. The material is similar to the stonework found on the adjacent village site. There points of a shape recalling Folsom, but unfluted and of much coarser workmanship, were found. A third and fourth week-end trip were by the Rice Lake and Spooner center groups respectively, which dug into two mounds of an extensive group located north of Chetek. Woodland type material was recovered.</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 2991 The Manitoba Museum, with the financial as- sistance of the Winnipeg Tribune, sent a three man party on a reconnaissance of sections of the Nelson, Echemenish, and Hay Rivers. Historic or late sites, those containing Black Duck Focus and Headwaters Lake Aspect pottery, and non- ceramic sites, were recorded in the rather rugged region. The 1948 Kaskaskia Expedition was a coopera- tive one between the University of Chicago and the Illinois State Museum under the joint direc- tion of John C. McGregor and Kenneth Orr. Four main areas were investigated in the Starved Rock State Park, LaSalle County. Five new cul- tural manifestations, or influences, were dis- covered, the most interesting of which are a very early occupation by a non-pottery-using people and a type of Woodland material that probably has never been described. The three other types of culture include European trade goods. Pos- sibly they belong to tribes of the Illini who oc- cupied the region immediately around Fort St. Louis during the late seventeenth century. The Indiana Historical Society, Indiana Uni- versity, and the Indiana Department of Conser- vation cooperated in sponsoring an archaeological field school at the Angel site during the past season. In the same state the Indiana Historical Bureau sponsored a survey of proposed reservoir areas by Vernon Helmen, Indiana University. THE PLAINS Waldo R. Wedel writes, "Of outstanding im- portance during the year was the Sixth Plains Archaeological Conference, held at the Univer- sity of Nebraska, in Lincoln, on November 95- 97, 1948. More than 100 people were present, representing most of the states and educational and research institutions of the Great Plains. Archaeologists, geologists, palaeontologists, and others participated in a three day discussion centering about the broad theme of Man, Cul- ture, and Climate in the Great Plains. It has become increasingly evident that the history of native man, hunter as well as farmer, in the plains region is closely bound up with long- and short-term environmental fluctuations. From this it follows that a close coordination between archaeology and the findings of geologists, soil experts, pollen analysts, palaeontologists, clima- tologists, and other specialists would be neces- sary. Recent terrace studies in the central Plains seem to offer a promising field of study in relation to the antiquity of man here, but there are wide discrepancies in the time estimates and interpretations, relative as well as absolute, of the earth scientists and the archaeologists. These discrepancies will have to be ironed out before we can really make serious headway against the per- plexing problems already laid open to attack. The Conference was the first all out attack on these broader mutual problems, and the discus- sions have laid the groundwork for further and more definitive studies as field investigations progress." Waldo R. Wedel has generously contributed a lengthy account of Archaeological work in the Missouri Basin. This is largely the work of the program under the Smithsonian Institution. An account of previous work, i.e. during 1947-1948, can be found in the Sixty-Fifth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. During 1948 archaeological investigations were directed to- ward salvage of materials threatened with de- struction by the construction of Federal multi- purpose dams. For the Federal Government, this work was carried on by the Missouri River Basin Survey under direction of the Smithsonian Insti- tution. In addition, a number of state agencies were active in the field work connected with the salvage operations. The Survey, through cooperative arrangement with the Bureau of Reclamation, conducted a large-scale excavation program at Medicine Creek Reservoir in southwestern Nebraska. Power machinery and hand labor were provided by the Bureau, professional supervision by the Survey. Most or all of six prehistoric Upper Re- publican village sites were laid bare, as were two smaller and older Woodland sites. The stripping operations made it possible to work out com- munity settlement patterns and to determine the location and interrelationships of houses, mid- dens, caches, and other features. The sites, esti- mated to date between the 14th and 15th cen- turies, were characterized by small clusters of rectanguloid pit houses, in striking contrast to the great compact, often fortified, earthlodge villages of protohistoric and historic times. Abundant evidence of maize-bean-squash-sun- flower agriculture was recovered in the Upper Republican sites, but there was no proof of</page><page sequence="7">292 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY horticultural practices in the two older Wood- land sites. Analysis of artifacts should afford important clues to cultural changes within the local Upper Republican complex. Dates of vary- ing accuracy may be determined from well- preserved house timbers. Other than this work, the Survey operations were confined mainly to reconnaissance and limited excavations. Work in the Angostura reservoir area near Hot Springs, South Dakota, located some 70 camp sites, some of which pro- duced arrowpoints reminiscent of Plainview, Texas points and other fairly old artifacts. The work here may make possible a correlation of pottery sequences of the eastern plains with the non-pottery horizons of the western plains. Limited excavations in the Heart Butte Reser- voir, North Dakota, brought to light camp sites related to the pottery-makers (Mandan-Hidatsa) of the Missouri Valley. Sixty village sites, in- cluding unfortified and fortified villages, were recorded along the Missouri between Pierre, South Dakota, and the Cheyenne River. Several time periods are probably represented in these sites, the excavation of a selected number is urgently needed because the rising reservoir waters will destroy a very large part of the basic data on the early corn-growing Indians of the Upper Missouri Valley. Through the cooperation with the Corps of Engineers, a burial mound lying on the future spillway of the Fort Randall Dam, South Dakota, was excavated. Such mounds are very uncom- mon along the Missouri and the data which is being prepared for publication should be of great importance. Cooperating agencies contributed an unprece- dented amount of work. The University of Kansas conducted limited excavations in and near the Kanopolis Reservoir in north central Kansas. Evidence of successive occupations by Woodland, Hopewellian, Upper Republican, and Great Bend Aspect peoples was discovered. On the Little Arkansas, pueblo sherds were found in a Great Bend Aspect site confirming estimates that this aspect dated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The University of Ne- braska conducted a summer field session at Harlan County Reservoir. A Dismal River cul- ture village site was excavated. This is the east- ernmost site known for this culture and is identi- fiable as late seventeenth or early eighteenth cen- tury Plains Apache occupation. The Nebraska Historical Society excavated on six Upper Re- publican sites in the Medicine Creek Reservoir upstream from the Survey operations. In the same reservoir, The Nebraska State Museum excavated deeply buried camp sites. These are quite ancient, but the cultural affiliations and age of the materials are still uncertain. The University of North Dakota, jointly with the North Dakota Historical Society, opened two burial mounds in Baldhill Reservoir in east- ern North Dakota. General correlation with some Woodland horizon related to manifestations in the Minnesota region is suggested. The Uni- versity of Missouri, the Missouri Archaeological Society and the Academy of Science of St. Louis made surveys in the Bull Shoals, Clearwater, Pomme de Terre, Table Rock, Waco, and Joanna reservoir areas. In response to questions concerning important developments in theory and interpretation, Wedel contributes the following. The work throughout the Missouri Basin and elsewhere in the Great Plains has further clarified the de- velopment of human societies here from primi- tive hunting and gathering economies to more complex sedentary corn-growing cultures. It is believed that a series of stages, or culture types, is or soon will be demonstrated; that these will more or less parallel a sequence elsewhere in North America; and, that they will show a pro- gressively more complete mastery by man of his local environment. The large scale excavations at Medicine Creek are particularly noteworthy from this standpoint. They are also interesting because the district lies at or near the present western limits of successful maize horticulture, and the archaeological findings indicate that for a time, at least, native farming methods appar- ently were adequate to provide a livelihood for Indians there resident. Just why this semi- horticultural economy in the western plains lost out in the long run is still to be explained. At Medicine Creek, at Angostura, and else- where there is accumulating a very promising body of data regarding the pre-pottery hunting complexes of the western plains. Some of these are evidently of very considerable antiquity, as is evidenced by an overburden of windblown soils up to 50 feet in depth. There is, however, grow-</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 993 ing doubt in the minds of many field archaeolo- gists that these buried, pre-pottery sites have the great antiquity ascribed to them by geologists and palaeontologists. Tentative dates have been assigned on the basis of correlations with stream terraces, which in turn have been provisionally correlated with Pleistocene erosional and deposi- tional phenomena. Typologically, it now appears that many of the remains ascribed to Pleistocene times are actually much later, so that the whole basis of terrace chronology will have to be critically reexamined. At the University of Texas, T. N. Campbell, J. Charles Kelley and Alex. Kreiger continue work on various manuscripts. Campbell, with the assistance of the Texas Memorial Museum, ex- cavated a shell midden on the shore of San Antonio Bay. Kelley conducted a reconnaissance of a section of the Rio Grande Valley, Krieger, who was awarded the Viking Fund Prize in Archaeology for 1948, supervised excavation in the Battle Mound on the Red River, Lafayette County, Arkansas. Field work was in charge of Lynn Howard, University of Michigan. A study of alluvial deposits about the base of the mounds was made. The pottery was found, surprisingly enough, to correspond closely to material from the Belcher Focus in Louisiana. R. L. Stevenson, working for the River Basin Surveys, Smithsonian Institution, sur- veyed "Dam B" basin on the Neches River, Mc- Gee Bend reservoir area on the Angelina River, in the San Angelo area, and in the Lavon and Grapevine areas near Forth Worth and Dallas. The Dallas Archaeological Society and the Houston Anthropological Society surveyed vari- ous reservoir areas. The Dallas Society began field work in late Pleistocene fossil localities in the Panhandle and also commenced excavation at Lubbock. These promise to yield data con- cerning the extinction of species which are found elsewhere in association with artifacts. Grayson Meade and Glen Evans of the Texas Memorial Museum, Austin, continued work in the deep deposits of the Montell Spring shelter north of Uvalde. The site promised to provide crucial information concerning the little-known, but undoubtedly early, horizon which precedes typical Edwards Plateau culture. Mr. Eugene Mear of San Antonio screened three true or classic Folsom Fluted Points from the back dirt of a cave west of San Antonio. This was reported to the University of Texas, and arrangements for excavation were made by the Texas Memorial Museum. For the University of Denver, Arnold Withers conducted a survey of east-central Colorado for the River Basin Surveys. This included eight reservoir sites in the Blue River-South Platte drainage and six reservoir areas in the vicinity of Pueblo, Colorado. Under the direction of R. E. Bell the first field season of the University of Oklahoma resumed excavations at the Scott site near Wister bringing to light one component of the Fourche Maline complex, an early archaeo- logical horizon in eastern Oklahoma. The Nor- man site, near Wagoner, was also excavated. During August this excavation became a joint project with the Smithsonian Institution, J. Caldwell in charge. The large conical mound exhibited a number of building periods attribut- able to the Spiro Focus of the Gibson Aspect as are, apparently, the other mounds in this group. Various excavations and surveys brought to light over 100 new sites, material from Hopewell horizons, and the like. The University of Okla- homa Museum has been allotted new quarters and also it now houses the Mississippi Valley Dendrochronology Laboratory which was moved there from the University of Chicago.

The exca- vation was done literally just ahead of exca- vators digging for fill material for the dam. This was a large village site associated with a truncated mound. The site will prove to be a good demon- stration of Woodland acculturation by a Mis- sissippi group. What is more important, the Mississippi house patterns, closely related to Hiwassee Focus material to the south, strongly suggest that the infiltration of this manifesta- tion came from the southeast, probably east Tennessee. Possibly the Mississippi people who brought this culture were late, probably con- temporaneous with Fort Ancient to the north and Moundville to the south but because of their marginal position were relegated to the role of backward "country cousins." The Alabama Museum of Natural History excavated what has been called the site of "Coosa" on the Coosa River near Childersburg. Coosa was a town of the Creek Indians which was a flourishing village at the time de Soto visited it in 1540. It lasted until late in the 18th century when the French and English took a census there. Excavations proved that this par- ticular site was not occupied as early as 1540, the pottery found is similar to the Ocmulgee Fields series. Search for the earlier village will continue. Survey work under the direction of Joffre Coe of the University of Carolina provided important information on the early cultures of the central part of the state. One site in Montgomery County yielded, at the bottom level, arrow points identical with the Pinto Basin and Gypsum Cave types. These are overlaid in succession by ma- terial which resembles Stallings Island and early Woodland. Two other sites also produced evi- dence of a gradual change from late Archaic to Early Woodland.

THE PACIFIC COAST Information concerning the rapidly expanding and important work in this region has been generously contributed by Robert F. Heizer. The University of California, Berkeley, exca- vated the Patrick's Point Shellmound in Hum- bolt County, this being the first scientific work in northwestern California in over thirty years. An Early and a Late Phase, as yet unnamed, have been identified. In Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles county, the University of California, Berkeley and Los Angeles, jointly continued excavation in the Tank Site and located addi- tional sites ascribable to the Topanga Culture. This culture has not been dated but its age is probably measured in millennia. It contains essen- tial elements of the San Dieguito culture known from further south. Burial position and types of metates and manos indicate some relationship with the Oak Grove Cultures. The Southwest Museum excavated a Pinto Culture site in the Southern California Desert. Thirty mineralized burials from the Cedarquist site, excavated by the California Archaeological</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 295 Survey, extend the distribution of the Middle Horizon Culture southward. Drakes Bay, an- other site investigated by the Survey, is in the region where Sir Francis Drake careened his Golden Hind in 1597. Peterson Mound, a Middle and Late Horizon site in a little known section of the Central Valley, produced 80 burials and numerous artifacts when excavated by Heizer and students from the University of California, Berkeley. The Pine Flat sites excavated by the Survey are located in an area to be flooded by a dam on the King's River. Three sites contained late pottery in the uppermost levels. A distinc- tively different culture occurs in the lower levels. The Isabela sites investigated by the Survey and the Smithsonian River Basin Surveys are caves in which pictographs abound. San Antonio Mis- sion is being rebuilt under the direction of Harry S. Downie, Diocese archaeologist of the Catholic Church. Archaeological work recovers the orig- inal ground plan and much of the building ma- terials for the careful reconstruction. The large and active graduate student group at Berkeley have found inclination and time to contract for two projects. One is a dictionary of ethnic and village names concerning California Indians. Some 8000 cards are on file recording, also, village sites which will be valuable to archaeologists working in the ethnographic period. The second is a handbook of archaeo- logical methods for the California area. The California Archaeological Survey was inaugurated on August 1, 1948. Supporting funds are from the state legislature as part of the regular University of California budget, and are adequate to ensure a considerable and continu- ous research program. Close cooperation is en- visaged with research institutions in the state other than the University; interested persons are also included. A second survey organization is the Archaeological Survey Association of South- ern California (composed of individuals and in- stitutions between Santa Barbara and San Diego). Stanford University, under the guidance of F. Keesing, is making a start at local archaeo- logical work. The increasing amount of archaeological work being done in California is rapidly outlining a rather definite picture of the prehistory of the State. Southern and Central California appear to have been occupied in early Postglacial times; the northwestern portion of the state was prob- ably settled aboriginally quite late and by peoples coming from the north. Northeastern and north-central California form borders of the area which L. Cressman has so ably concerned him- self, and these regions seem to have a history which is tied with that of the Great Basin. Cul- tural interrelationships and time comparisons be- tween several areas remain the most important general tasks facing the archaeologist. That these problems continue to resist solution is probably a sign that not enough sites have been dug. Though local sequences are known in some de- tail, these often have been erected on the basis of a limited number of sites. The time problem (i.e. culture dating) is being approached by S. F. Cook in his mound-sampling analytical studies and through chemical analyses of human bone. Re- newed interest in distribution studies may also have significance to the dating problem in fur- nishing cross ties between cultures of different areas. Progress in unravelling California pre- history is inevitable if for no other reason than that considerable fieldwork is under way. It may be added that California is becoming his- tory-conscious and considerable use is being made of archaeologists to identify, excavate, interpret, or analyze historical sites and events. From American Antiquity we may add that students from the University of California as- sisted in River Basin Survey work under the direction of Philip Drucker, Smithsonian Insti- tution, on the Columbia, Snake, and Rogue Rivers. Drucker also reports that the University of Oregon has provided quarters for the River Basin Survey office and contributed to work in the Columbia Basin. The University of Washing- ton-River Basin Survey under the direction of R. D. Daugherty excavated a series of pit houses which tie in with those from the dig on the Mc- Nary reservoir area. The important work of Luther S. Cressman of University of Oregon continues in the Klamath Indian Reservation. This project is a continua- tion of the study of Klamath prehistory and its relation to the Post-pluvial cultures of the north- ern Great Basin. Excavation of Medicine Rock Cave brought to light an occupation ante-dating the eruption of Mt. Mazuma. The Kuwakum Springs site is of particular importance because it contains house pits from the historic and</page><page sequence="11">296 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY possibly protohistoric periods dug into an earlier midden.

Secondly, it was discovered that as early as the twelfth century Indians excavated large walk-in wells. A third item reported was the extensive use by the Pueblo Indians of both cremation and inhumation during the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries. With the aid of students from the Department of Anthropology of the University of Denver, Marie Wormington and others undertook salvage activities in the reservoir and construction areas of the Cherry Creek Project in Arapahoe County, Colorado. Another party completed the excava- tion of the Turner site near Cisco, Utah, during August. Robert Lister, directing the field course in Anthropology of the University of Colorado spent five weeks in Yampa Canyon. This work substantiated the existence of Fremont type cul- ture, there, and revealed an earlier pre-pottery culture horizon in a deep midden. The Museum of Northern Arizona sponsored an expedition under the direction of Harold S. Colton and Watson Smith, Four small pueblos were excavated. The University of New Mexico Field Sessions under the general direction of Paul Reiter excavated an early Pueblo IV village site in Tijeras Canyon. A nearby small site of the late Pueblo III and early Pueblo IV was also exca- vated under the direction of Fred Wendorf. It yielded stone masonry with flagstone flooring and Galisteo Black on White Pottery which is as interesting as the absence of Rio Grande Glaze ware. Edward Dittert continued excavation in the Cebolleta Mesa area south of Grants and Reynold J. Ruppe undertook a quantitative archaeological survey of several sections of land. These two men found a small series of partially subterranean jacal-like structures, large surface pueblos with standing walls of a Chaco-like masonry and kivas which have more than a superficial resemblance to Kiatuthlanna. The Early Man Division of the Upper Gila Expedition, Peabody Museum, Harvard Uni- versity (with the University of New Mexico cooperating) under the field direction of Herbert W. Dick made an extensive survey of the Plains of San Augustin and excavated Bat Cave in Catron County, New Mexico. Three distinct levels were found in the cave. These, according to Antevs, represent more than 7000 years of geological and climatic history. The upper two levels contain materials ascribed to the Chiricahua and San Pedro Stages of the Cochise Culture and to certain Southern Cali- fornia industries. Maize is found from the sur- face to within a few inches of the bottom of the top level (dated by Antevs from 2500 B.C. to 1200 A.D.). According to Dr. Paul Mangelsdorf and Mr. Earle Smith, Department of Botany, Harvard University, the maize exhibits an evolu- tionary sequence beginning with a very small primitive type. In connection with the stabilization work in Chaco Canyon National Monument, Gordon Vivian and Raymond Roxey have discovered a large number of artifacts of painted wood which came from one of the north rooms in the central sector of Chetro Ketl. Dr. Gordon Baldwin has completed laboratory work for his report in the</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 297 Patayan sites which he excavated last fall in the Davis Dam Reservoir area on the Lower Colo- rado. The field School of Adams State College of Alamosa, Colorado, under the direction of Fred Worman, excavated an early Pueblo IV Glaze site in the Bandelier National Monument. David de Harport, graduate student of Harvard University, began an intensive survey of the Canyon de Chelley National Monument, locat- ing 140 sites in the lower part of the Canyon of that name. The students of Texas Technological Institute returned to Arrowhead Ruin near Glorieta, New Mexico. The Gila Pueblo project at Mesa Verde was completed at the end of the second field season under the direction of Deric O'Bryan. Two sites were excavated, a Basket- maker III area containing two pit houses and a Pueblo III surface compound. A second project spent last spring in the Tularosa drainage south of Quemado, New Mexico excavating about half of an early Pueblo III site. Paul S. Martin and John B. Rinaldo of the Chicago Museum of Natural History continued investigation of the sequence of Cochise-Mogol- lon cultures as represented in the Pine Lawn Valley west of central New Mexico. A concen- tration of Cochise-type grinding tools and hearths on Wet Legget arroyo has been tenta- tively dated at about 4000 B.c. by Antevs. Other excavations included fourteen additional pit- houses on the Turkey Foot Ridge site. This brought to light material tentatively classified as San Francisco and Georgetown Phases, thus filling a gap in the local sequence between the Pine Lawn Phase and the Three Circle Phase. Other houses show a transformation from a Mogollon pit house to an Anasazi type kiva. Additional data concerning the transition from pit house to kiva was recorded. THE CARIBBEAN Inadvertently an account of archaeology in the islands of the Caribbean was omitted from the news section published in 1948. The following in its entirety was contributed by Irving B. Rouse, Peabody Museum, New Haven. Included in this survey are (1) Central America, (8) the north coast of South America from Colombia to the Guianas, and (3) the West Indies. Although the archaeological resources of these areas are poor relative to the regions of higher civilization in Middle America and the Central Andes, areas (1) and (3) have attracted considerable attention, the former because of what it may reveal concerning relations between the high civilizations of North and South America, and the latter for its indications of contact between the Southeastern United States and Northeastern South America via the Antilles. On the west, archaeologists have also been at- tracted to Central America and Colombia by their wealth of grave objects, including particu- larly pottery and ornaments of precious metals. Drs. Matthew W. Stirling and Gordon R. Willey, working in Herrera Province, Panama, for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the National Geographic Society during the winter of 1947-48, excavated two such cemeteries dating from the classic Code period, which is well known from previous research by S. K. Lothrop, J. Alden Mason, and others (Lothrop, 1937-42). This ex- pedition also dug a shell heap, Monagrillo, con- taining plain and incised pottery contrasting with the polychrome Code styles and presum- ably earlier. The pottery is said to have certain resemblances to West Indian, early South American, and early Eastern North American ceramics; hence, it may shed light on the prob- lems of North-South America connections. S. K. Lothrop worked in Costa Rica for the Harvard Peabody Museum during the same sea- son, excavating graves in an attempt to form a chronological frame for the large pottery collec- tions now in museums. For Colombia, Dr. Luis Duque Gomez reports mapping and projected excavations in the Santa Marta region on the Caribbean coast. Some 3000 house foundations have been reported, no stratig- raphy has been announced. These have revealed evidence of far more extensive village settlements than were previously known from the area. The eastern part of the Caribbean, particularly the Antilles, has been the subject of research programs by two institutions, the U. S. National Museum and Yale University. For the former institution, Herbert W. Kreiger revisited Haiti during January, 1947, in an attempt to locate the sites of the Indian villages visited by Columbus. For the latter, Robert R. Howard completed this past summer an archaeological survey of Jamaica in which he was able to show that the Indians of</page><page sequence="13">298 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY that island were relatively backward in compari- son with the culture center in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Polychrome pottery from Saba and St. Eusta- tius, Lesser Antilles, closely resembles the earliest ceramics in Trinidad and Puerto Rico (Josselin de Jong, 1947). This further substantiates the theory that this polychrome style marks the first movement of the Arawak Indians out from the mainland of South America into the Antilles (Rouse, 1947). During the year Ricardo E. Alegria of the University of Puerto Rico undertook further ex- cavations in the site of Luquillo on that island, obtaining additional examples of the early, poly- chrome style of pottery. Sr. Alegria has also com- pleted installation of a museum at the Uni- versity. In Cuba, a group of local archaeologists have published a report on Cayo Ocampo, a site on an island in the Bay of Cienfuegos which may have been the village visited by Columbus in this area (Morales Patino and others, 1947). The incised pottery illustrated has a number of resemblances with the ceramics of the Glades area in southern Florida and suggests contact between the two regions, although there is no evidence of direct connection. A series of cave explorations have also been undertaken in Cuba (Nunez Jimenez, 1948a, 1948b). In particular, local interest has been aroused by a series of pictographs in the Cueva del Este on the Isla de Pinos, with the source of these pictographs a subject of considerable debate. The most important publication of the year has been Volume 4 of the Handbook of South American Indians, dealing with the Circum- Caribbean Tribes (Steward, 1948). The first up-to-date summaries of the archaeology of the area are provided by this volume. In the introduction to the volume and in a separate publication, Steward (1948, 1947) has advanced the theory of a uniform Circum-Carib- bean culture extending from Central America across the northern coast of South America, through the West Indies, and possibly also into the Southeastern United States. He suggests that this is the result of a single diffusion from the area of high civilization in the Central Andes, while at the same time admitting the possibility of independent, parallel development in various parts of the area. Steward's hypothesis runs counter to the opinion of several specialists such as Howard (1947) and Rouse (1947), who believe that the cultures of the western and eastern parts of the area are more or less distinct and have developed separately with only secondary influences, in the former case from the Central Andes and in the latter, from Amazonia. Steward's inclusion of the Southeastern United States in his Circum-Carib- bean culture also runs counter to prevailing opin- ion (e.g., Swanton, 1946). BIBLIOGRAPHY Howard, George D.

Garcia Payon was working principally at Tajin and Romero Ar- turo excavated at Tlaltilco. Carlos Margain be- gan a new project at Teotihuacan where new frescos were reported. Forty small tombs were excavated at Coixtlahuaca by Ignacio Vernal, Felipe Montemayo and Jorge Obregon. S. Linne returned to Mexico to make an archaeological survey of the region around Iguala and Chil- pancingo and across the unknown area of east- ern Guerrero and Western Oaxaca via Atixtac, Tlapa, and Silacayopan. Richard S. McNeish began another field season in the Huasteca; re- ports via the grapevine are that he has dis- covered deep sites yielding a ceramic series reach- ing downward from that reported by Ekholm from the Tampico region. The Middle American Research Institute at Tulane, Robert Wauchope, Director, has been especially active. Various reports on areas be- tween Texas and Guatemala are in preparation or actually in press. The principal field activity of the Division of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution was the second Bonampak Expedition, carried out in cooperation with the Instituto de Antropologia e Historia, and financed by the United Fruit Company. Bonam- pak, a small Maya Old Empire site in Chiapas, is noted for a three room temple and other build- ings, the walls of which are decorated with beautiful and revealing paintings. These will ap- parently alter to a certain extent our concept of Maya culture. They show the Maya to be anything but a peaceful and ascetic nation. In Guatemala additional tombs of the early Miraflores phase were found at Kaminaljuyu. E. M. Shook and A. V. Kidder of the Carnegie Institution removed some three hundred pottery vessels and a number of jades and other speci- mens. At Zaculeu, a Mam site, in the Depart- ment of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, excava- tion and repair work continued under the direc- tion of John Dimick, Aubrey Trik, and Richard Woodbury. The site served as a great ceremonial center from the beginning of the Classic Period until the Conquest. Joel Canby of Harvard University excavated systematically for the first time Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley, Honduras. Preliminary pot- tery analysis shows three clear-cut periods to have existed. The earliest is a bichrome group which apparently existed before the introduc- tion and development of Usulutan ware. This type correlates with the Playa de los Muertos finds. The middle ceramic class is rich in Usulutan wares and bichrome material, but lacks Ulua Polychrome. Tentatively this would seem to be closely related to the Ulua Polychrome found in the lower level at Santa Rita. The latest mate- rial is the Ulua-Yojoa Polychrome. The assign- ment of this ware to the upper level wares found at Playa de los Muertos, Santa Rita, and Los Naranjos can be made without hesitation. Gordon Ekholm, who has kindly assembled much of the above, adds an interesting comment. During 1948 there has been an increasing interest in the concept of a "Mesoamerican" area as a cultural unit existing through time, that is, from the Archaic Period to the Conquest. The term and the concept are both being widely used and it looks as though they will stick. It'is also evi- dent that we will have to redefine what we are describing as the Archaic or Middle Culture Period, especially because of the Carnegie Insti- tution's work in the Miraflores Period at Kaminaljuyu. Elaborate tombs, the biggest mound at the site, remarkably fine jade objects were found, all elements of the "Classic Com- plex."

SOUTH AMERICA4 In 1946, the National Museum of Peru, under the late lamented Julio Tello, discovered a Coast Chavin Period cemetery at Ancon. This cemetery is undoubtedly the burial place related to the shell middens on the hills above the Necropoljs. The grave ceramics are in the Chavin style. Two pottery fragments are said to be reminis- cent of those of the Paracas Cavernas culture of south Peru. Mr. and Mrs. Richard Schaedel con- ducted a survey of highland stone sculpture in Peru and Bolivia. Students of Dr. Jorge C. Muelle of the University of San Marcos have been carrying on stratigraphic tests and ceme- tery excavations at Ilo. Dr. Morante of the Uni- versity of Arequipa in a recent publication de- scribes the Churajon style ceramics taken from distinctive tombs at the Floria Leche Plant site near Arequipa. At La Paz, Sr. Max Portugal is continuing with research on the Bolivian altiplano sites at Copacabana, Huata, and Jesus de Machaca. In one location he has isolated a new style of black incised ware. At Tiahuanaco, Portugal has dis- covered a semi-subterranean temple, the interior walls of which are decorated with geometric and anthropomorphic figures. At the same site, after the earthquake of 1947, a hitherto unknown monolith was uncovered. It is reported to be in the same style as the Monolito Bennett and the famous Gateway of the Sun. On the Sabanna de Bogota, two members of the Colombia Servicio de Arqueologia have worked in two sites of the Chibcha culture. At Ubate mummified remains, painted mantas and emeralds were recovered from dry graves. At Sibate some 50 tombs were opened. In the very little known region of Turbo, on the Gulf of Uraba, Sr. Arcila Velza has completed a survey of archaeological sites. At the well-known site and national monument of San Agustin in southern Colombia, a number of tombs have been opened. Dr. Luis Duque Gomez points to the sig- nificance of the fact that the style of goldwork in these tombs is quite comparable to that from other areas and cultures which have always been considered late. This places the generally as- sumed antiquity of San Agustin in some doubt. Near Barranquila, at Tubara, Sr. Carlos Angulo has recovered ceramics and stonework which indicate connections with nearby Santa Marta and Pairona. In September, the Instituto Etnologico of the University of Cauca and the Institute of Social Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution, did some ethnographical work and a start was made toward an archaeological survey of the region near the upper Piendamo River in the Central Cordillera. The pottery from thirteen sites visited had characteristics remarkably suggestive of "archaic horizon" types from Peru. The pottery has some resemblances to Upper Cauca types and some to sherds from the neighborhood of Popayan, but it is not exactly like any style hitherto reported. Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Evans have been con- ducting an archaeological survey in the vicinity of Marajo Island, Brazil. Thirteen sites exca- vated on the north coast of Marajo had been built up of refuse on natural rises. The pottery is predominately crude plain or crude incised ware. Only a few sherds of the well-known Marajo painted styles were found and all of them came from the upper levels of the sites. On Mexiana, Mr. and Mrs. Evans found one large occupation midden in which Marajo Champleve ware was well represented and was associated with a true corrugated ware. Other Mexiana sites were different, representing complexes here- tofore unknown. On Caviana, the majority of thirteen sites showed affiliations to some of the Mexiana sites because of the presence of a crude plainware, some modelling, huge burial urns, stone axes, and jadeite pendants. One 4 The assistance of Gordon R. Willey is gratefully acknowledged.</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 301 cemetery site on the island did have connections with South Marajo. At present the investi- gators feel that North Marajo and the islands form one area-culture unit as opposed to South Marajo. The latter seems to be the center for the classic Marajo style. With the exception of the foregoing, South American archaeology, aside from Peru, does not progress rapidly; for example, the relatively few excavations are not commensurate with the size of the continent, or the problems which are known. The pressing problems are still those of fundamental distribution and chronology. Some areas still lag behind the level of achievement that was attained in the Southwestern United States by about 1916; others have reached this point and have passed it a little but are still un- ready for any effective time-space synthesis. One exception is the West Indies, mentioned above, where the work of Rouse has brought this area into the foreground of those best known in the New World. The following note by Willey is of considerable interest. In Peruvian archaeology there has been, during the past three or four years, an attempt to formulate a generalized chronological structure or time-space classification comparable in some ways to those employed in the southwestern and southeastern United States. Since the Uhle field work of the first decade of this century, and the subsequent Kroeber, Bennett, and Institute of Andean Research investigations leading up to the Viru Program of 1946, distributional and se- quential information has been piling up from various regions in the Peru-Bolivian area. The late J. C. Tello and Rafael Larco Hoyle, in Peru, have also contributed to this store of knowledge. Now, several workers, among them R. Larco Hoyle, W. D. Strong, W. C. Bennett, and G. R. Willey have all advanced chronological-develop- mental schemes which are aimed at integrating and expressing in overall terms the story of cul- ture growth in the Peruvian area. There are some similarities and some divergences among all these schemes. It is important that all of them tend to see three major cultural stages which have progressed through time: a relatively un- specialized basic agricultural horizon which has been referred to in some of the outlines as the "Formative" stage; a level of intense regional specialization and classicism in the arts, which represents a fluorescent peak of Andean art and technology; and a final stage upon which em- phasis and interests seem to have been turned away from the artistic and technical and de- voted to problems of war, conquest, social con- trol, political incorporation, and empire.
