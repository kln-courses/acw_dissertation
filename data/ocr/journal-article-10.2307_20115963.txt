<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVA FEDER KITTAY THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR1 ABSTRACT. A number of philosophers, linguists and psychologists have made the dual claim that metaphor is cognitively significant and that metaphorical utterances have a meaning not reducible to literal paraphrase. Such a position requires support from an account of metaphorical meaning that can render metaphors cognitively meaningful without the reduction to literal statement. It therefore requires a theory of meaning that can integrate metaphor within its sematics, yet specify why it is not reducible to literal paraphrase. I introduce the idea of a "second-order meaning", of which metaphor is but one instance, that is a function on literal-conventional, i.e., first-order meaning, and outline a linguistic framework designed to provide a representation of linguistic meaning for both. This framework is designed to represent linguistic units ranging from a single word to an entire text since I argue that the by-now familiar position that the sentence is the appropriate unit for metaphor has mislead us into asking the wrong questions about metaphorical meaning. With this apparatus, we can specify the conditions under which an utterance may transcend the constraints on first-order meaning (transgressions not always apparent on the sentential level), without thereby being "meaningless". Conversely, we can specify the conditions that may render apparently odd utterances first-order meaningful rather than metaphorical. In this way we see how metaphorical language differs both from deviant language and from specialized language such as technical language, fanciful and fantastical language (in fairy tales, science fiction, etc.). We need to be able to specify how metaphorical meanings emerge, if we adopt the position, currently espoused by many,2 that metaphorical meaning is not reducible to a literal pharaphrase. Although analyses of metaphor have, in the past few years, surpassed previous ones in subtle ty and sophistication, we still lack an adequate understanding of metaphorical meaning. The present paper will be devoted to an issue that has received relatively little attention, namely, the identification of an utterance as metaphorical. How do we recognize that an utterance is metaphorical rather than literal or inept and mistaken? Generally, we have little difficulty making such distinctions. But what are the criteria we use in so identifying utterances which ought to be metaphorically interpreted. In asking how we recognize metaphors, I am posing not a psychological but a conceptual question; that is, I am not asking for the psychological processes we undergo when we opt for a metaphorical interpretation. I am asking what conditions pertain when the appropriate interpretation Synthese 58 (1984) 153-202. 0039-7857/84/0582-0153 $05.00 ? 1984 by D. Reidel Publishing Company</page><page sequence="2">154 EVA FEDER KITTAY of an utterance is metaphorical rather than literal, technical, fanciful, figurative but not metaphorical or when the language used is simply mistaken. Insofar as the conditions, taken individually are only neces sary and not sufficient, some will not rule out interpretations other than metaphorical ones, but the set of necessary conditions conjointly are meant to pick out just those utterances for which it would be ap propriate to give a metaphorical interpretation. THE UNIT OF DISCOURSE OF A METAPHORICAL UTTERANCE The question of how we identify a metaphor has never been adequately treated, in part, I believe, because writers have not yet satisfactorily identified the unit of discourse that constitutes a metaphor. Language can only be identified as metaphorical by virtue of linguistic and contextual conditions that require that we interpret it differently from its surrounding discourse; therefore, we can not give the conditions by which we recognize metaphors without identifying that unit of dis course which constitutes a metaphor. Since contemporary thinkers have turned their attention to the question, it has frequently been pointed out that a word, in isolation, can neither be identified as a metaphor nor be given a metaphorical interpretation. These writers have claimed that only sentences are metaphors because only in a sentence can we tell whether a given word is used literally or metaphorically. Yet on the one hand, the linguistic setting of words used metaphorically need not be as full as a sentence: without a context to indicate the contrary, we generally recognize the phrase "the slum of bloom" to be a metaphorical expression, although it is not necessarily apparent without some further contextual information which term in the expression should be understood metaphorically.3 On the other hand, we may have an entire sentence which may be interpretable either literally or metaphorically and only a given context can render one interpretation rather than the other appropriate. Consider the following example, from Michael Reddy, 1. The rock is getting brittle with age.4 While the sentence might be literal in the context of a geological exposition, it is metaphorical when spoken of a professor emeritus. Thus the sentence may be too large or too small a unit to determine whether some expression is to be identified as a metaphor. In order to</page><page sequence="3">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 155 understand how we recognize that an utterance is metaphorical we ought to consider that the unit of metaphor is independent of any particular grammatical unit. If we want to contrast literal and metaphorical meaning, we need to be able to span linguistic units which range from a word to a group of coherently organized sentences. Some linguists have attempted to formulate explicit rules of cohesiveness by which to explain why sentences hang together in a text. Such rules of cohesiveness will prove to be useful in articulating the considerations which are operative when we identify and interpret a bit of discourse metaphor.5 FIRST-ORDER AND SECOND-ORDER MEANING Some may claim that the fact that metaphors are not identifiable either as single words (which thus would have meanings in some way similar to or analogous to word-meaning) nor as sentences (which would thus have meanings by virtue of rules concatenating single words into sentences) constitutes an argument against a semantics of metaphor; that the difficulty I point to indicates that metaphor is not a unit of discourse, but a use of discourse, and as such belongs to pragmatics.6 If we adopt the view presented at the outset, that metaphors are not reducible to literal paraphrases, then we have to demonstrate that an understanding of metaphor belongs, at least in part to semantics. If metaphor belonged only to pragmatics then the question of metaphor would be simply a question of how we pick out the appropriate proposition intended by the utterer of the expression, a proposition which could then be treated as identical to the propositional content of some literal expression, and so be equivalent to literal paraphrase. In developing the criteria for identifying metaphors, the value of treating metaphor semantically, as well a pragmatically, will become evident. I want to posit and utilize a distinction that cuts across the semantic-pragmatic divide and is more useful in delineating metaphor, that is, between a first-order meaning and a second-order meaning. Roughly speaking, first-order meaning is the sort of thing we have in mind when we ask about "the meaning" of the word "rock" or in the case of a sentence the meaning of the words as derived from the concatentations of the "the meanings" of the individual words in the sentence 1 above, (as in an account given according to some version of transformational grammar). A second-order meaning is obtained when</page><page sequence="4">156 EVA FEDER KITTAY features of the utterance and its context indicate to the hearer or reader that the first-order meaning of the expression is either unavailable or is not appropriate - for example, in case 1 is uttered in the absence of any discussion of rocks - but that the first-order meaning of the utterance is not irrelevant to its appropriate interpretation(s), i.e., an aging professor is being spoken of as a rock that is brittle. The distinction as put forward here is necessarily rough, but will be refined as we develop the technical apparatus needed to speak more precisely. Grice, in his article 'Utterer's Meaning and Intentions',7 draws a number of relevant distinctions between "timeless meaning", "applied timeless meaning", "occasion meaning" and 'utterer's occasion mean ing". If we apply his distinctions to the term "rock", they may be explicated as follows: (a) the timeless meaning(s) of an utterance-type x: this includes some specification of one or more meanings that x has in a chosen version of given language; e.g., the various senses of "rock" in English, as a noun, solid mineral matter; as a verb, to move back and forth, etc. (b) the applied timeless meaning: this is the specification of which timeless meaning is connected to a particular utterance of x; e.g., the sense of "rock" in sentence 1, i.e., the noun, solid mineral matter. (c) the occasion-meaning of an utterance-type: this involves a consideration of what an utterer meant by x; e.g., if x is "rock" in sentence 1, the occasion meaning of the timeworn "rock" would be the aging "professor". (d) the utterer's occasion meaning is what an utterer meant by uttering x . The specification of (a) - (c) would be given in quotation marks or italics, while that of (d) would be given as indirect speech, e.g., the utterer meant the aging professor by uttering "the rock" in sentence 1. Timeless meaning and applied timeless meaning depend on con ventional assignments of meaning to utterance-types. The utterance type's occasion meaning and the utterer's occasion meaning are often, but need not be, identical to some applied timeless meaning. If, for example, 1 were uttered in reference to some actual geological speci men then our examples for (c) and (d) would coincide with that for (b). I</page><page sequence="5">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 157 will say that when both the utterance-type's occasion meaning and the utterer's occasion meaning are identical to the appropriate applied timeless meaning, then we have first-order meaning.8 When there is a divergence between either the utterance-type's occasion meaning or the utterer's occasion meaning and the appropriate applied timeless meaning of the utterance, then I will say that this is a case of second-order meaning. This is not simply a distinction between literal and figurative lan guage, for there is nonfigurative language that has a second-order meaning. Searle's case of indirect speech acts are of this sort - e.g., "Excuse me, you are stepping on my toe". Taken as its first-order meaning such a statement, at best, requires the response "I know" or "I didn't know". It is an indirect speech act because there is a further message connected to the first, namely "get off my toe".9 I want to assimilate the latter to a second-order meaning. First and second-order meanings are related in that second-order meaning is some function of first-order meaning. Whether we have metaphor, indirect speech acts, or some other form of second-order meaning, depends on the function which operates on first-order mean ing. In this paper I will speak of what constitutes first- and second-order meaning generally and what conditions, taken conjointly, are necessary (but not sufficient) to identify metaphors as opposed both to other manifestations of first-order meaning and to some other forms of second-order meaning. I will not here attempt to specify a particular function for metaphor because to do so and to adequately justify the necessary moves requires a full discussion of how we interpret metaphor, a task beyond the scope of the present paper.10 METAPHOR AND DEVIANCE Distinguishing the two orders of discourse can be of immediate help in resolving a debate as to whether or not metaphors are to be regarded as deviant expressions. If they are a form of deviant language then it may be futile to attempt any sort of systematic inquiry into the meaning of metaphors. And yet to view metaphors as deviant appears to condemn a substantial portion of both daily and specialized discourse as deviant, since metaphors pervade ordinary and even specialized languages. The position to be worked out in this paper is that metaphors necessarily break some semantic rules, however subtly, but only to be</page><page sequence="6">158 EVA FEDER KITTAY subject to a new set of conditions whereby they are metaphors as opposed to mistakes or other "deviant" language. The semantic rules which metaphors break are the ones governing first-order discourse. These are rules governing discourse in which we are to assume that the applied timeless meanings are coincident with the utterance-type's occasion meaning. Where there is an indication (the nature of which will be discussed below) that there is a divergence between the two, we no longer have first-order discourse, for second-order meaning emer ges just when there is a divergence between some applied timeless meaning and an utterance occasion meaning. The utterance is then second-order rule-governed. My attempts here are directed at integrating metaphoric meaning into a general theory of meaning and simultaneously accounting for the distinctive character of metaphor. Most discussions of meaning have dealt only with what I am calling first-order signification, where the units of word and sentence figure prominently. My first task then is to find a sufficiently general way of discussing the meaning of utterance types which will be useful to second-order, as well as first-order signification. My next task will be to establish the significant first-order rules whose violation both signals and is a condition of a second-order meaning of metaphor. The accomplishment of these two goals will yield the set of necessary conditions for the recognition of a metaphorical utterance. FIRST-ORDER MEANING To accomplish these tasks, it will be helpful to develop a formalism by which to represent a theory of metaphoric meaning. Therefore, let us consider a language to be comprised of classes of utterances of increasing grammatical complexity, from a single word to an entire text or discourse. These classes will be indicated by U?, U1,... Um,... Un, n^O, such that U{) is a class of simplest utterance-types, and elements of ?Jm+l are obtained by concatenations of utterances belonging to U?, U1,... Um according to some syntactic rules. The reason for introduc ing classes of utterances so ordered is to avoid the necessity of specifying whether one is dealing with a single word, a phrase, a sentence or a coherent group of sentences (a text or discourse) except insofar as these stand in relation to one another in degrees of gram matical complexity.</page><page sequence="7">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 159 At each level of complexity n, each unit in Un, the element ue Un,is assigned a first-order meaning. First-order meaning is the most literal yet still conventional meaning of an expression. The use of both "literal" and "conventional" here is not a redundancy. If we were speaking only of the class of utterances of null complexity, Ui), that is of uncombined single words, then we could not draw a distinction between a conventional and literal meaning. However, as soon as we speak of utterances where n &gt; 0 we find that the conventional meaning is not necessarily the literal meaning. This is the case with idioms and very conventionalized metaphors. For example, the conventional meaning of the sentence "Time flies", results from a literal use of "time" but a metaphoric use of "flies". In order to make use only of the literal meanings of the words of the sentence, one would need to give th? sentence a very nonconventional interpretation, such as an imperative ordering one to check how quickly flies move through the air (see below p. 181). For the present analysis of first-order meaning, I want to consider only the case of words with both their literal and conventional mean ings, which will henceforth be designated as meaningLC. For an utterance-type, u, the first-order meaning can be regarded as the set of all possible literal and conventional senses of u. The sense of a term consists in a set of concepts and a set of conditions which relate to the permissable semantic combinations of the term. This formulation does not yet differ, in form, from standard models of the semantic components of a transformational grammar, such as that given by Katz and Fodor,11 (henceforth KF). But this model needs to be modified in light of two considerations: first the need to accommodate the generalization of meaning to classes of utterance-types U?, Ul ... Un, including pertinent considerations from discourse grammars, and second the need to include the insights of semantic field theory. On my view, a literal conventional sense (senseLC) has three com ponents. The first component 'a' is a set of concepts, also called semantic features or markers, along with syntactic markers indicating a syntactic category (e.g., noun, transitive verb, adjective, etc.). The second element '?', is a set of conditions and restrictions on the semantic combination of utterances (in KF the intersentential restric tions are called selection restriction violations). These will be known as sc-rules. These two components may be illustrated with the term "rock" as understood in 1 above: the a-component includes (NOUN) (Inanimate) (Object) (Mineral) etc.; the ?-component contains</page><page sequence="8">160 EVA FEDER KITTAY specifications of semantic restrictions on the sorts of terms with which "rock" might combine, e.g., "rock" in the sense understood here cannot combine with verbs whose subject must include the concept (Animate). Although the ?-component is meant to capture semantic as opposed to syntactic restrictions on the combinatory possibilities of a term, I do not exclude the possibility (again in contrast with the KF model) that it may include certain empirical considerations. This point will be relevant later in our discussion. The third element ' y' is a semantic field indicator and includes the sense-relations which relate the set of concepts 'a' to other concepts in a conceptual domain. The notion of a semantic field is based on the empirically supported belief that words in a language may be group ed according to their conceptual content, so that they may be said to apply to distinct, although interconnected domains.12 This concep tual content is indicated by the 'a' and '?' components of the term's sense.13 Semantic fields are a set of lexical items together with the conceptual domains to which they apply.14 Their elements are terms which are related to one another within the field by sense relations such as antonymy, synonymy, complementarity, superordination, etc. The theory of semantic fields holds that the meaning of a term in a language, is, in part, dependent on the sense-relations that terms bear to other items in the language. For example, "hot" and "cold" are gradable antonyms within a field for temperature terms. If we are to understand the meaning of the term "hot", we need to know that it applies to the thermal state of an entity, and also that if a thing to which thermal states may be attributed is not hot, it may, but need not, be cold. It may be warm or cool. That is, we need to know that, at least in those cases where terms such as warm and cool are admitted, "x is not hot =?&gt; is cold". The permissability or impermissability of such entailments suggests that we ignore semantic fields and sense relations at serious peril to an understanding of a term's meaning - particularly since such entail ments have notoriously failed to yield to other analyses of a term's meaning.15 The significance of the sense-relations is most obvious in the inter pretation of metaphor. I have argued elsewhere that when we interpret a metaphor we transfer the sense-relations a term bears to other terms in a semantic field unto a second semantic field, forcing a reor ganization of the latter.16</page><page sequence="9">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 161 FIRST-ORDER INTERPRETATION Thus far, in speaking of meaningsLC and sensesLC we have been speaking of what Grice would call "timeless meaning". What we must now do is establish a way of speaking of the applied timeless meaning of an utterance (-type). For this purpose we will speak of an interpretation^ of an utterance-type. An interpretation^ of an utterance, u, is any one of the senses which appear in the meaning of u. For each u e U?, that is, for uncombined terms, the meaningLC is assigned through the use of a lexicon or dictionary. Such a lexicon or dictionary will provide the semantic representation of each word in the language (see Katz, 1971, pp. 91-2). In my scheme a lexicon would consist of the class of utterances U? along with their meanings. Again, I leave open the question as to whether some empirical information, particularly of a well-entrenched sort, may be included in such as "dictionary" representation. Where n &gt; 0, the meaningLC of u will be a function of the constituent parts of u. Where u is a sentence, we can apply rules that are the equivalent of the projection rules in the KF model: these are a "set of rules that reconstruct the speaker's ability to project sentence mean ings from morpheme meanings [i.e., the meaning representations that are given in the dictionary]." (Katz, 1971, p. 36).17 In my more generalized scheme, projection rules will serve as the combinatory mechanism for all utterances of a grammatical complexity greater than zero. In formulating projection rules applicable to combinations of sentences, we will have recourse to work in the theory of cohesion. We have already indicated what the meaning for an utterance, u, would look like. In order to speak of the semantic interpretation of u e U? we would need to select one senseLC of w. In order to speak of the semantic interpretation of some ue Un, where n &gt;0, we need to appeal to some specification of projection rules. Projection rules operate on underlying phrase markers where the lowest level constituents are already partially interpreted, that is, where some senses of the terms' meaning will have been eliminated from consideration by syntactic considerations. It will "bracket together" these senses, i.e., combine their senses according to appropriate syntac tic rules. We arrive at an interpretation of an utterance by choosing a given sense of a constituent of an utterance which can combine with the</page><page sequence="10">162 EVA FEDER KITTAY sense of another consituent in accordance with the sc-conditions of these senses.18 Insofar as projection rules and sc-rules play a critical role in the interpretation of higher level units and since metaphors are properly such only at the higher levels, we can see that rules for combining terms play a significant role in identifying and interpreting metaphors. We need therefore to consider these in further detail. As I have pointed out earlier, we must often consider an utterance in its linguistic or situa tional context to identify it as a metaphor. Our projection rules must characterize not only how a word combines within a sentence, but also how a sentence coheres with its context. Our projection rules must govern permissable linguistic combinations which are both intra- and intersentential. On a number of occasions, I have spoken of "the linguistic and situational context of a sentence". For the purposes of this discussion, I want to presume the truth of the expressibility principle: that the salient elements of a situational context can be expressed in linguistic terms.19 Therefore, I will generally speak only of an utterance's context, presuming either that this context is given as linguistic, or that if it is nonlinguistic, then at least part of the relevant situation, viz., its most salient features, together with the utterance in question, can be linguistically rendered as an utterance of a level of complexity higher than that of the given expression. What might projection rules look like for intersentential cases, e.g., for a group of coherent sentences which appear to form (part of) a text. A sentence has clearly defined grammatical features. These serve to provide a structure which makes possible a cohesiveness among its constituents. When we consider a group of sentences which we judge to cohere as a text, we need to look for those features of the text that serve to bind the sentences together into a semantic whole.20 The use of demonstratives and pronouns, the repetition of key words, the use of elliptic phrases requiring information in other sentences for their interpretation, conjunctives and the use of lexically related words dispersed through the text are examples of the sort of cohesive elements we find in texts. The linguists Halliday and Hasan have classified these cohesive rela tions as reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical cohesion.21 The two sentences below, which comprise a 'text', illustrate several sorts of cohesive relations.</page><page sequence="11">the identification of metaphor 163 2(i) Put the blueberry tart on your best platter, (ii) It deserves to be beautifully presented. "It" is coreferential with "blueberry tart". Had we used an expression such as "the pastry" we would have a coreferential relation with a substitute term which also exhibits lexical cohesion. The terms "your best platter" and "beautifully presented" exhibit lexical cohesion both in that "best" coheres with "beautifully" and "platter" coheres with "presented". "Best" also coheres with "deserves". The relations which Halliday and Hasan speak of and which we have just illustrated with text 2, may, I want to claim, be viewed as one of two types of relations. When terms are so related that they may be substitutable for one another in their respective sentences, preserving the sentences' syntactic well-formedness, I will say that they stand in a substitutive relation to one another. When terms are so related that they may potentially collocate within a single sentence, or syntactically well-formed utterance, I will say that they stand in a collocative relation to one another. In addition to preserving well-formedness, substitutive and collocative relations, insofar as they are cohesive relations, must preserve the cohesive character of the text. For example, all referring terms which are cohesively substitutable should corefer (in our example, "blueberry tart", "it", "the pastry"); cohesively substitutable predi cates should all be predicable of the same referent (with appropriate modifications for the tense, manner, mood, etc.). The cohesive feature of substitutable modifiers seems harder to specify. I must leave it to cohesion theorists to work out how cohesive factors work in all cases. Furthermore, collocative relations would need, as a minimum constraint, to respect the semantic combination conditions of the terms related. For example "It" could collate with "deserves" because "deserves" involves an evaluative sc-condition and "best" is an evaluative term, hence the possibility of forming, 2 (iii) It deserves the best. Cohesiveness requires attention to the field indicator of the terms related. To say that "your best platter" and "beautifully presented" are lexically cohesive (a collocative relation) is to say that the terms belong to the same or to adjacent semantic fields. The object of projection rules which function intersententially is to bracket together the elements of the sentences which enter into</page><page sequence="12">164 EVA FEDER KITTAY cohesive relations with one another. We can now define our cohesive projection rules. Definition of Cohesive Projection Rules For terms ua and ux, where ua is a constituent of ub and ux is a constituent of uy, uy^ub, and both ub and uy are constituents of an utterance uz,22 the cohesive projection rules bracket together ua and ux so that (A) in the case ua and ux are in a cohesive substitutive relation, both ua and ux must conform to the sc-restrictions operating on either ua or ux in their respective utterances uh and uy; and in the case that ua and ux are referring terms, they must preserve coreference. (B) in the case that ua and ux are in a cohesive collocative relation, ua must conform to the sc-rules governing ux, and ux must conform to the sc-rules governing ua. (C) in the case of (A), we treat ua and ux as if there were a sentence formed from the constituents of uz, in which ux replaced ua or ua replaced ux. (For example, if we take uz to be text 2 and ub = 2(0, wy = 2(ii) we could substitute for ua, "It" in 2(h), for ux "blueberry tart" from 2(i).) In the case of (B), we treat ua and ux as if there was a sentence formable from the constituents of uz in which ua collocates with ux. (For example, if we take ua = "best" in ub, and ux = "deserves" in uy then we can form sentence 2(iii).) These hypothetical sentences will be called conversion sentences. The projection rules which operate intrasentially can then operate on these conversions. In our analysis we will find it useful to work with the conversion sentences permitted by the cohesive projection rule, and where neces sary to enhance readability, we will allow for trivial modifications of the substituted and collocated terms. A METAPHORICAL UTTERANCE: FOCUS AND FRAME Now that we have developed our notions of first-order meaning, sense</page><page sequence="13">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 165 and interpretation, as well as the cohesive projection rule, we are ready to talk about how these enter into the identification of utterances as metaphorical. I will adopt the general position that in a metaphor there is some constituent of the utterance, which is incongruous when that utterance is given an interpretationLC. The incongruent constituent we will call, following Max Black, the focus, while the remaining con stituents will be part of the frame.23 The focus alone is incomplete as a metaphorical utterance, whereas the frame and focus together indicate the congruity which appears requisite for a metaphorical utter ance.24 In 3 below, a line from Wallace Stevens' poem "Banal Sojourn", the incongruity between "slum" and the remaining sentence is readily apparent. 3. The garden was a slum of bloom. The frame/focus distinction is not always so unproblematic. First, the incongruity may be concealed in implications of the linguistic or situational context, so that a linguistically expanded frame is necessary to capture the particular violation in question. This is the case in sentences like 1 above. Furthermore, sometimes it is difficult to identify a frame and a focus because a given utterance is not simply composed of one part which is to be understood metaphorically while the remaining terms are to be understood literally: we have constructions where the metaphors are far more complex, where two or more metaphors or figures other than metaphor are operative in a single utterance. For example, a metaphorical verb may be predicated of a different metaphorical subject, or some other figure may modify or be modified by a metaphorically used term. Consider the line from Shakespeare's sonnet 73, 4(i) Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. We cannot tell whether the line is literal, unlikely but possible, or metaphorical. If it is metaphorical, is it the case that "choirs" is used metaphorically for tree branches or that "sweet birds" is used metaphorically for children who sing in choirs? That is, we cannot establish whether there is a focus/frame distinction to be made or what the focus would be, if the frame/focus distinction does apply. Looking at the two previous lines in the sonnet we see that the focus is indeed "choirs".</page><page sequence="14">166 EVA FEDER KITTAY 4(ii) When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang But when we consider the poem as a whole we learn that the autumnal boughs are themselves metonyms for the autumn which serves as a metaphor for the aging of the poet-lover and the dying of a love affair: 4(iii) In me thou see'st the twilight of such a day As after sunset fadeth in the West. Shakespeare's is a complexly structured metaphor in which the focus and frame do not remain constant through the poem and in which metaphors becoms metonyms for more encompassing constructions which are themselves metaphorical. Rather than the examples, 4(i)-(iii) invalidating the focus/frame distinction, they exhibit its usefullness in articulatig the complexity of such metaphors. A somewhat different problem arises in the line: 5. The heart is a lonely hunter. As that sentence is understood in the title of the Carson McCuller's book, the sentence employs the term "heart" with a conventional m?tonymie use for the emotions, particularly love, and the term "hunter" metaphorically to speak of what "heart" metonymically signifies. Normally the frame helps us to identify the incongruity of the focus and directs us to the appropriate interpretation. But how are we to identify a focus when there are apparently two focii and little else in the utterance? Moreover, as a title there is little linguistically renderable context, outside the book itself, into which we could embed the line and disambiguate frame and focus. Titles, like newspaper headlines, aphorisms and similar utterances, are meant to be understood or at least to suggest possible meanings, as they stand. (Though, of course, many a writer will pack more into the title than at first meets the mind's eye and a reading of the article or book will reveal many other readings as well".) First we need to recognize that the focus/frame distinction pertains to other figurative language, such as metonomy. Consider 6 below, 6. The crown is restless tonight. We have a conventional metonym, "crown" which is used to speak of</page><page sequence="15">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 167 the king. In 6, the incongruity is the result of a metonym rather than a metaphor. The frame/focus distinction can be maintained on the basis of different sorts of first-order meaning incongruities. The nature of the incongruity as well as other additional constraints will distinguish the metaphorical focus. In 5,1 suggest that there are two distinct foci, one m?tonymie, the other metaphorical. The use of two figures in a single utterance such as 5 will most likely render an utterance intelligible if the reader can identify conventional, albeit nonliteral meanings, for at least one of the terms. And when dealing with phrases or sentences meant to be understood without a specified context, we reasonably draw upon the common background knowledge, both linguistic and nonlinguistic, which serves competent, mature speakers of the language as an "implicit context", one which can, nonetheless be overriden by a more highly specified context. In interpreting 5 we must rely on such an "implicit frame" to identify the metonynic use of "heart" for love. That which the heart then signifies is, through synedoche, taken for the person in love - this again is a familiar linguistic convention. "The heart" thus interpreted, serves as a frame for the phrase "the lonely hunter". But it is a "minimal frame" in that we in fact must evoke a far ranging understanding of certain linguistic and literary conventions in order to make out what the metaphor is. An idea of a "minimal frame" may be used to mark an apparent incongruity in light of a commonly assumed "implicit frame", and is to be taken as a tentative indication that we may be dealing with a metaphor, although we may not yet know what the metaphor is. In the phrase from 3 above, "slum of bloom", given the generally known senses of "bloom" (see note 3 for a contrary instance) and of "slum" the terms are incongruous. Thus if we take "bloom" as the focus, and ''the slum of bloom" as the minimal frame, the utterance that sufficiently disambiguates the embedded utterance is the sentence 3, which is the frame (simpliciter). We posited an incongruity in the metaphorical utterance such that the frame and focus reflected this incongruity and we noted that the distinction and indeed an incongruity were not necessarily confined to metaphors. In dealing with metaphor we need to ask the following questions: it is always the case that there is an incongruity in a metaphorical utterance, if so, is there an incongruity distinctive to metaphor and what is its significance? The general position, that metaphor involves some incongruity (be it semantic deviation, a conceptual anomaly or category mistake), a</page><page sequence="16">168 EVA FEDER KITTAY position as old as Aristotle's treatment of the subject, has been seriously questioned in a number of its more specific versions. Those who attack this view are sometimes critical of the particular mechanism used to specify the anomaly. Others, as I have pointed out earlier, object to the thesis in its more general form, because they believe it is inimicable to the view that metaphors have an irreducible cognitive content. The reasoning goes as follows: If metaphor is semantically anomalous, then it cannot be subject to linguistic rules; hence we cannot speak of metaphoric meaning, for the production and interpretation of meaningful utterances is rule-governed; but if there is no distinctive metaphorical meaning, then there is no irreducible conceptual content which may have cognitive efficacy. I hope to show that this set of inferences is not justified even if we grant that metaphors involve what are anomalies, given first-order rules. To say a thing is not subject to a given set of rules is not to say that it is subject to no rules. In my treatment, therefore, I want to be sufficiently precise about the rules of discourse violated by metaphors, so that we can see what rules it does indeed follow. Moreover, I want to show how the violations are systematically connected to the proper interpretations of metaphorical utterances. First, we must acknowledge the justifiable criticism the anomaly view has received. Critics have pointed out sentences which are completely nondeviant which can be used metaphorically. We have already encountered one such example, the sentence 1 above. Proverbs and colloquial expressions are a rich source of illustrations: 7. I will kill two birds with one stone. 8. He is up against the wall. Another interesting nondeviant sentence is 9. Smith is a plumber, which is metaphorical in case both speaker and hearer know that Smith is not a plumber, but is a surgeon. But this criticism is founded on the belief that the unit of a metaphorical utterance is a sentence. Although 1, 7, 8, and 9, are sentences and hence complete as grammatical utterances they are not complete as metaphorical utterances. Their completeness as metaphor requires a setting which renders them metaphorical. That setting, I</page><page sequence="17">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 169 contend, will yield a first-order incongruity of a conceptual sort. The nature of the deviance attributed to metaphorical sentences has often been couched in terms of a selection restriction violation, that is, a violation of restrictions on what sort of things one can intelligibly predicate of a given thing. This, by Katz's own admission, is a semantic rendering of Ryle's category mistake.25 Yet clearly, none of the above sentences contain within them selection restriction violations. Any incongruities resulting from embedding the sentences in units of a high level of complexity could not be captured by the KF notion of a selection restriction violation since these are only operative within a sentence (not so, of course, for the Rylean category mistake). But consider sentence 10. 10. The seal dragged himself out of the office. If 'seal' is taken to mean the animal, sentence 10 also does not violate any selection restrictions. But unlike sentences 1, 7, 8, and 9, sentence 10 is odd. It is, nonetheless, conceptually possible. The oddity appears empirical for seals of the animal variety are rarely found in offices. Thus whether 10 is metaphorical or not depends on a context which will clarify the nature of the oddity of 10. Some writers, wary of the synthetic-analytic distinction have criti cized the view that there are rules for the concatenation of words in a sentence which are purely linguistic and have criticized the notion of a selection restriction rule of the Katzian sort. These writers26 want to speak of degrees of semantic deviance. On this view 10 would be less deviant than 3, for example. Yet without a suitable context, we cannot claim that 10 is deviant; it may even be literally true. But such concerns arise when take the unit of metaphor to be the sentence. When the sentence is conceived of as the semantic and metaphorical unit then we are lead to distinguish between a degree of semantic deviance and absolute semantic deviance, as given in the confines of the sentence. The problem dissolves when we see that a metaphorical utterance, i.e., focus and frame, need not be a sentence, but may be any utterance of some non-null degree of grammatical complexity and by recognizing that there are semantic strictures governing the combination of units from the first level of complexity upperwards. We can then begin to ask the right sorts of questions concerning the nature of the incongruity inherent in metaphorical discourse.</page><page sequence="18">170 EVA FEDER KITTAY INCONGRUITY The nature of the incongruity is related to the violation of the first-order rule-governed sc-restrictions and conditions of elements bracketed together by projection rules. The incongruity is a direct result of the bringing together of semantic fields which are kept distinct in first-order discourse, and which I will call 'incompatible'. A more precise formulation is given below. The Incongruity Principle Consider a complete metaphorical utterance, uc, with a focus uA and frame uB. Let us say that one tries to give an interpretationLC of uc. Once the projection rules have operated on the lowest level con stituents of uc, bracketing them according to their syntactic (for intrasentential) and cohesive (for extrasentential) relations, there will be at least some ua and some ub, constituents of uA and uB respectively, so that ua has been bracketed with ub. However, given some preferred27 senseLC of ub, (a) there is no senseLC of ua which would not violate some sc-rule governing ua and ub and (b) the y-component of the preferred senseLC of ub is in compatible with each senseLC of ua. In case there is some sentence in which ua and ub are both constituents, there would then be no first-order interpretation of that sentence. In case ua and ub belong to two different sentences, both of which are constituents of uc, there is a conversion sentence formable through the cohesive projection rule which would not have a first-order inter pretation. To illustrate the functioning of the Incongruity Principle (henceforth IP), let us consider sentence 3. If we take the focus of the metaphor to be the word "slum" then the minimal frame is the phrase "slum of bloom". The terms "slum" and "bloom" would have y-components that are incompatible for the terms come from two distinct semantic fields, let us say the fields of urban life and gardening (or vegetation), respectively. Further, we can suppose that "bloom" would have as a sc-condition, that in a prepositional phrase, it concatenate with terms that have a marker</page><page sequence="19">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 171 ((Living) (Vegetative)).28 In the case of a sentence such as 1, where the context concerns an aging professor emeritus, 1 would itself be the focus and the sentences with which it combines to form a text would constitute the frame. If 1 occurs as a sentence in an otherwise rambling conversation and is said as an aside, accompanied perhaps by a gesture, e.g., a nod in the direction of the professor, we must take the relevant gesture as the situational context which can, at least in part, be rendered linguistically, thus providing the frame of the metaphor. For the purposes of illustration, consider the text below: ll(i) The rock is getting brittle with age. (ii) He responds to his students' questions with none of his former subtlety. (iii) His lectures also lack the verve which was characteristic of them. From 11, we see that if we take sentences ll(i) - (iii) as cohering to form a discourse, then "he" in ll(ii) would have "the rock" in ll(i) as an anaphoric referent. Presumably, a cohesive projection rule would bracket "the rock" and "he" as well as the possessive pronouns "his" in ll(ii) and "his" in ll(iii). The possessive pronouns would be possessive pronominalizations of the rock. According to our definition of cohesive projection rules, "the rock" ought to be substitutable for "he" in ll(ii) and "the rock's" ought to be substitutable for "his" in ll(ii) and ll(iii). But "rock" has none of the markers, i.e., (HUMAN), (ANIMAL), (ANIMATE), which would make it satisfy the sc-condition of the subject of "responds" and this is especially so when we consider the phrase "responds to his student's questions" - only humans, particularly instructors of some sort, have students to respond to. The remainder of the sentence "with none of his former subtlety" further restricts the choice of subject to satisfy certain presuppositions, especially that the subject was at one time subtle in his response. A similar analysis can, I believe, be undertaken with regard to other elements of the text. Note that although the term "professor" is never mentioned, there is a lexical cohesion which comes from a choice of words appropriate to a semantic field of higher learning, of which "professor" is an important and central member. There is an implicit invocation of this field and with it of "professor".</page><page sequence="20">172 EVA FEDER KITTAY In both 3 and 11, the violations in the sc-rules appear to be simply violations of what in the KF model are selection restriction rules. In KF, selection restriction rules are those markers in the semantic represen tation of a term which indicate which markers must be possessed by terms with which the word collocates in a sentence. Within the semantic representation of a word, these restrictions are specified for the different categories of terms a word might combine with, so that we will have one set of restrictions for the subject, another for a transitive verb, another for the direct object, still another for the indirect object, etc. The selection restrictions pertain only intrasententially and provide what Katz, Fodor, Chomsky and others take to be linguistic and conceptual information possessed as part of the linguistic competence of speakers of the language. We questioned earlier whether linguistic information of this sort was sufficient, whether we need not also include knowledge concerning the world in determining what terms can meaningfullyLC concatenate. Metaphorical utterances which suggested this were cases such as 9, where Smith is known to be a surgeon, and 10, where the context indicates that no real seal entered the office. In the case of 9, there is no selection restriction violation between "Smith", as the name of a person, and "plumber" as in the predicate "is a 'plumber'". The verb phrases would simply require the marker (HUMAN) in its subject. The oddity of sentence 10 surely does not appear due to any linguistic facts but to our empirical knowledge of seals and offices. Yet if we construct linguistic contexts for 9 and 10 which contain, explicity, the required information to give these sentences a metaphorical interpretation, we find that we rely far less substantially on what seems to be empirical rather than linguistic or conceptual know ledge. (Here, as elsewhere, I presume that the distinction only pertains relative to some set of common suppositions and a common language.) Consider 12, a text in which the situational context, that both speaker and hearer know that Smith is a surgeon and not a plumber, is given expression in the discourse. 12(i) Don't let Dr. Smith perform such a delicate surgical pre cedure. (ii) Smith is a plumber. (iii) His last two patients died.</page><page sequence="21">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 173 The cohesive projection rules would bring "plumber" (in 12(H)) together with both the occurrences of Smith (in 12(i) and 12(h)) and the pronominalized possessive (inl2(iii)) while preserving coreference. Both 12' and 12" are plausible candidates for texts which preserve the propositional content of sentences 12(i), (ii), (iii) taken together. 12'(i) Don't let that plumber perform such a delicate surgical procedure. (ii) Dr. Smith's last two patients died. 12"(i) Don't let Dr. Smith perform such a delicate surgical pro cedure. (ii) That plumber's last two patients died.29 While it is true that none of the sentences in 12 violate selection restriction rules, the substitutions made possible by the cohesive coreferential relations yield structures which are contrary, not just to empirical, but also to linguistic facts. This is particularly evident in 12'(ii) for the sense of the term "patient" is here sufficiently disam biguated by the lexical field indicated by terms such as "surgical procedure" and "died" to recognize that we are speaking of that sense captured in the representation ((HUMAN) (Under the care of a physician)). A plumber, however, operates only on inanimate, non human things. Although the cohesive projection rules can substitute "plumber" for noun phrases whose verb phrases included terms from the field of surgical medicine in texts 12, 12', 12", phrases such as "plumber's patient" would not be given a first-order interpretation.30 At this point I want to put forth what I take to be only a conjecture but which, if true turns out to have significant consequences. The conjecture is that whenever we decide, on the basis of some oddity in utterance, to give that utterance a metaphorical interpretation, if we construct or reconstruct a sufficiently rich context, we will find that the sc-conditions violated turn out to be the familiar selection restrictions of the KF model, either in the sentence or phrase which is the metaphorical utterance, or in some conversion permitted by our cohesive projection rules; moreover, with one important qualification which I will discuss below, if there is no possible conversion which yields a selection restriction violation between the focus and frame of the metaphor (or the related metaphor generated by the conversion) the</page><page sequence="22">174 EVA FEDER KITTAY oddity is such that it would be a misunderstanding of the utterance to interpret it metaphorically. Because this is merely a conjecture, I want to maintain a distinction between the sc-rules and the selection restriction violations, for if the hypothesis turns out to be false, it may be that there are other linguistic or nonlinguistic considerations which effect the way in which terms may be combined.31 If true, the significance of the conjecture lies in the fact that it places the question of identifying metaphors squarely within the province of semantics, or at least, a semantics broad enough to include the consideration of intersentential connections in discourse. If the hypothesis is correct then it is a necessary condition for the identification of an utterance as metaphorical that the utterance invlove a violation of first-order linguistic rules, and not merely that the utterance be empirically implausible though otherwise linguistically (first-order) sound. Furthermore, there is an even more important consideration regard ing the cognitive import of metaphor. The selection restrictions, along with other semantic markers, are meant to capture the conceptual content of the terms of the language, and if metaphor is to be capable of forcing a conceptual reorientation, it is plausible that only a conceptual incongruity, and not merely an empirical unlikelihood, would warrant a metaphorical interpretation. For if someone says something which challenges our beliefs concerning empirical matters and it turns out that what was said was true, we may have gained some new empirical information. But if metaphors are congnitive, it is not because they add to our store of factual data. It is because a metaphor causes us to think something in a new way, to reorganize the concepts we already have, and to help form new conceptualizations. For it to accomplish this conceptual task, it seems reasonable to expect that a conceptual incongruity be inherent in anything which is indeed a metaphor. This is because the conceptual incongruity, when the appropriate pragmatic considerations are operative, requires a conceptual resolution (an at least tentative conceptual reorganization) - just as the empirical novelty requires an empirical resolution (the acceptance or rejection of some unexpected empirical information). At this point a caveat is required for the distinction between the empirical and the conceptual is not as neat as the last sentence implies. I ought to have said that an empirical novelty generally requires an empirical resolution. But empirical novelty may eventuate in a concep</page><page sequence="23">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 175 tual reform or revolution for it may raise the issue of the adequacy of current conceptual constructs and contrawise, current conceptual con structs may importantly influence what is taken as empirical novelty. The general consensus amongst contemporary philosophers of science concerning the theory-ladenness of observation terms and the general puzzlement over the interaction of the theoretical, i.e., conceptual, and the empirical forces one to be humble in assertions such as those made in the previous paragraph. Nonetheless, these distinctions, still have value within relativized contexts. EXPLICIT CUES FOR METAPHOR Early in this paper, I distinguished the psychological from the logical question of identifying metaphors, claiming that an incongruity within the utterance itself or between the utterance and its situational context is a necessary condition for the identification of a metaphorical expres sion. However, when explicit cues are given, such incongruity does not appear to be necessary, logically or psychologically. We might say "speaking metaphorically..." where the ellipsis is replaced by a remark exhibiting no apparent incongruity. In what follows I hope to show that an incongruity of a logical sort is ultimately involved if such explicit cues are being correctly used. Consider the case exemplified by 13. 13. The thieves ordered him against the wall and tied his hands. There was no escape. He realized that both literally and metaphorically i) he was up against the wall and ii) his hands were tied. In 13, there is no apparent textual incongruity: no selection restrictions are violated, there is no empirical falsity or oddity, no sc-conditions appear unfulfilled. Yet notice that we could aptly (or even truthfully, if we want to accept the idea of metaphoric truth) describe a person's predicament as 13(i) or 13(H) where the truth conditions for the expressions' literal applications were not met. Similarly, a person might literally be "up against a wall", or have his or her hands tied, and yet metaphorically not be in such an uncomfortable position. The embed ded sentences 13(i) and 13(H), as meant metaphorically, do not indeed refer back to the circumstances portrayed in the first sentence of 13 in the immediate and direct way in which they so refer when they are</page><page sequence="24">176 EVA FEDER KITTAY meant literally. Rather they refer back to the second sentence, "There was no escape". An explicit elaboration of this analysis in textual terms would most likely produce the conditions required to satisfy the Incongruity Principle. Such an elaboration, however, is unnecessary if we supplement the IP with another principle, which I will call the Principle of the In dependence of Applicability Conditions (henceforth I AC). In text 13, we have sentences which may be sensible, even true whether inter preted literally or metaphorically. Indeed, although one generally says that a metaphor is either nonsensical or (obviously) false if interpreted literally, texts such as 13 support the view, that a metaphor may be an utterance which is both apt metaphorically and literally true. Goodman (1968) provides another example by pointing out that a painting may both be literally and figuratively "blue". The introduction of the IAC is intended to acknowledge this phenomenon and yet show how an incongruity is nonetheless intro duced into the discourse with such utterances, (utterances generally preceded by an explicit cuing of the metaphor), an incongruity these share with utterances to which the IP applies. The principle is based on the observation noted above that in texts such as 13, the sentences can have different truth conditions under a literal interpretation and under a metaphorical (or other second-order) interpretation. Truth conditions are only one among, what I call "conditions of applicability". Where the utterance is a statement, the conditions result in truth values for its literal interpretation. If the utterance is a performative, the conditions for its correct literal application would be felicity conditions. If an utterance is a descriptive phrase, the ap plicability of a literal reading involves conditions for the correct referential or attributive use. I believe we can fashion analogous conditions of applicability for second-order discourse, e.g., some statements or descriptions are metaphorically 'apt' while others are not. Conditions for applicability, then, are to be understood as broadly as necessary to include as many divers forms of utterance as metaphors come in, and metaphors come in virtually any form: assertions, ques tions, imperatives, performatives, definite descriptions, etc. In order to formulate the Principle of the Independence of Ap plicability Conditions, we need to remark first that what we call a second-order interpretation of an utterance involves some function either of a first-order interpetation of the utterance, if one exists, or of a</page><page sequence="25">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 177 first-order interpretation of the constituents of the utterance. In ad dition, we need to specify what we mean by the context of an utterance. The context of an utterance is another utterance of greater complexity of which the first is a constituent. That is, if one utterance ux e Uk is contained as a constituent of a more complex utterance, uy e Um (k&lt;m) we can say that the latter is the context for the former. In keeping with the expressibility principle enunciated earlier, whereby we assimilate the situational context to a linguistic one, the context may be the linguistic environs of ux or, it may be a linguistic rendering of the salient features of the situation in which ux is uttered.31 The General Principle of the Independence of Applicability Conditions Given some ux, in a given context uy, that is ux e Uk is contained as a constituent of uy e Um (where m &gt; k &gt; 0), which has more than one interpretation, and there is no uz e ?Jm+n, (k &lt; m &lt; m 4- n) which will disambiguate the two interpretations, the satisfaction of the ap plicability of one interpretation is different from and independent of the other interpretations. The Special IAC (for metaphor and other second-order significations) In the case that the IAC applies to u in a given context so that one interpretation is first-order and a second interpretation is a function of that first-order interpretation, i.e., is a second-order interpretation of the specified first-order interpretation, the latter may be a metaphorical interpretation. There are a number of important points we need to note in regard to the General IAC. It would appear to pertain in the case of all forms of ambiguity. However, in most types of ambiguity there is a supposition that given a sufficiently rich context (see note 32 in notes) the utter ance may be disambiguated. The IAC applies only when such disam biguation is not achieved by choosing a sufficently rich context. Note that, there are particular forms of second-order interpretation which are not metaphorical and to which the (special) IAC does not apply - but not because its meaning cannot be disambiguated. As I will claim and discuss more explicitly later, all utterances are potentially am</page><page sequence="26">178 EVA FEDER KITTAY biguous between literal and metaphorical interpretation if the context is not rich enough to permit such a disambiguation. But the metaphori cal cases to which the special IAP pertains are those in which no context can disambiguate between the literal and the metaphorical, that is, where both interpretations properly apply. Second-order significations which are not subject to the special IAC are exemplified by Searle's "indirect speech act". When Jones says to Brown, 'Pardon me, but you are stepping on my toe", the truth value of the informative first-order interpretation (i.e., the fact that Brown is stepping on Jones' toe) directly influences the appropriateness of the request which is the second-order interpretation (i.e., Jones' request to Brown that Brown cease stepping on Jones' toe). Were the first-order statement not true, the second-order interpretation would fail to be appropriate. Finally, the general IAC provides, quite serendipitously, the con ditions necessary for a pun. A pun is just a use of language where there is more than one possible interpretation of the phonetic or orthographic label and the conditions of applicability which are independent for each interpretation of at least two such interpretations are, in this particular instance, both fulfilled. The semantic cleverness required to bring about such a confluence often tickles our fancy. The observations concerning puns is of some significance, for although the IAC was formulated with the intent of explaining a certain feature of some metaphors, it has a range of application which is considerably broader. This, at once, legitimates the principle, removing some of its ad hoc character, and demonstrates the way in which the exploration of the phenomenon of metaphor helps us uncover general features of language. THE STRONG THESIS What underlies IAC for metaphor is that the first-and second-order interpretations represent, presuppose, or in some way allude to different semantic fields. In our own illustrations 13, we can recognize that talking about the actual binding of human hands is different, semantic ally and conceptually, from talking about escape possibilities, even though understanding the metaphor, as metaphor (and not just as an idiomatic expression) requires understanding the literal meaning. It is likely that IP and IAC are ultimately reducible to one another, but I will take them as two principles which can serve either alter</page><page sequence="27">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 179 natively or conjointly as a necessary condition for metaphor. Where there is no first-order interpretation then the Incongruity Principle is appropriate. Where u has at least one possible but implausible inter pretationLC both principles may serve conjointly. Where u has at least one possible and plausible interpretation^ as well as at least one plausible metaphorical interpretation, which would need to be signaled through a direct statement of an intent to have u be metaphorically interpreted, there the IAC Principle serves as the necessary condition. In formulating the notion that an incongruity between a focus and a frame constituted a necessary condition for metaphor we added a conjecture that, given the operation of the cohesive projection rules the incongruity could be identified as a selection restriction of the metaphorical utterance itself, or some "conversion" permissable from the utterance and its context. This view has to be modified in light of cases where there is an explicit signalling of metaphor and no apparent semantic incongruity. In these cases, I am suggesting that the conditions for the correct applicability of the utterance when inter preted literally is independent of similar conditions for an appropriate metaphorical interpretation. When there are independent conditions of applicability for first- and second-order interpretations there is an implicit logical incongruity in the way in which such metaphors as those contained in example 13 conflate the two independent sets of con ditions. To best see this we could change the example somewhat to 13'. My hands were tied (literally), but my hands were not tied (metaphorically). On a first-order reading of 13' with the parenthetical remarks omitted, we would have a contradictory sentence. If we assimilate logical and semantic (or linguistic) incongruity to conceptual in congruity we can state a strong version of our thesis: that all metaphors must have as a necessary condition some kind of conceptual in congruity on a first-order interpretation. THE ROLE OF CONTEXT In making these claims, the question of context plays a critical role. We have already seen how context functions to render metaphorical sentences which have perfectly coherent first-order interpretations, i.e., sentences in which there is no apparent semantic incongruity. We need</page><page sequence="28">180 EVA FEDER KITTAY to explore this role further, concentrating on how context functions is allowing us to identify an incongruent utterance as metaphorical rather than literal, though empirically implausible. In the process, we will see why what we have taken as necessary conditions, cannot also be sufficient conditions for an utterance to be interpreted metaphorically. The degree to which we have stressed the context-dependency of metaphor may appear to threaten efforts establishing a "rule of metaphor", for each context is unique, while each rule must be general. There are two points to be made here. First, we have developed a set of formulations which will permit us, given the plausibility of the expres sibility principle, to regard a term's context as yet another, though higher level, utterance. In this way, the original term or expression plus its context may be treated as would the expression itself, namely as an utterance-type, and not an utterance-token, which may itself be situ ated in a particular context. Second, it appears that with proper consideration of literal utterances, we see that they too are highly context-dependent and that for any given literal interpretation of the utterance, we make implicit or explicit use of the context. Indeed, a context-independent sentence is an abstraction which, at best, has methodological usefulness. If we are to speak of a semantics of natural language, we cannot ultimately ignore the dependence on context for the interpretation of all sentences. Searle, in his paper "Literal Meaning" offers amusing and persuasive arguments that (what has been treated as) a paradigmatic context-free sentence such as "the cat is on the mat," is, in fact, context-bound in many different ways.33 To Searle's arguments, we can add some of our own.34 Children's stories are a rich source for the context dependency of literal meaning for through these stories children are taught to appreciate the fact that there are many interpretations attributable to particular words and sentences and that the distinct interpretations are context dependent. In sentence 14 below, the context-insensitive heroine of children's stories, Amelia Bedelia is a newly hired maid who, when faced with a list of chores that include 14, puts a set of minature pants and shirts on a fryer intended for that night's dinner. 14. Dress the chicken. In another episode in which her charges attempt to teach her baseball, Amelia Bedelia causes havoc by continually misunderstanding the distinctive use of those baseball terms which are also found in other</page><page sequence="29">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 181 parts of the lexicon: she steals bases by removing them from their positions on the field; she hits a home run and responds to the children cheer "go Home, Amelia Bedelia", by running, with the stolen bases still in her arms, all the way back to the children's home, wondering all the while what a perculiar game baseball is! Amelia Bedelia's difficulty is her failure to recognize the multiple meaning of words and the context specificity of the various interpretations. Her linguistic incompetence causes her to have to have her victories fortuitously and in spite of the rules of the games which, whether keeping house or playing baseball all depend on this linguistic competence. The argument for the context dependency of literal interpretation is especially well reinforced by considering metaphorical language. We said that we need a context to determine if sentences 1, 7 - 10 are metaphors. But in that case, we need a context to determine if they are literal. Furthermore, sentences 7-10 illustrate that a literal reading is not always the preferred one. The same is true of the following: 15. Time flies. 16. Nixon's plumbers. Very special circumstances are required to give rise to a literal interpretation of these expressions. Sentence 15 is amusingly inter preted literally to the children's joke, "Time flies". "You can't. They fly too fast". Similarly, in the case of 16, although it is not unreasonable to presume that Nixon needed, on occasion to employ persons who specialize in fixing leaky faucets, a phrase such as 16 would not be likely to appear in national headlines if they were intended to be read literally. What these examples and others, such as 10, indicate is that when faced with phrases or sentences which are sundered from their context, we read them in such a way that we preserve the usual presumptions and expectations concerning our world. Sometimes this is facilitated by the fact that the questioned expression is comprised of terms which have a conventionalized, though nonliteral meaning (e.g., 15); here it is especially clear that the literal meaning is not always the preferred one. In sentences 10, and 15, 16, were all the terms read literally, a world very different from our own, one in which different expectations were the norm, would be presupposed. Quite sensibly such suppositions are not readily made. We would sooner alter the meanings of the words than alter our basic conceptions and trustworthy empirical expec</page><page sequence="30">182 EVA FEDER KITTAY tations. To interpret these utterances literally we would need to ask: Why would a sea lion be in an office? Why would one want to clock the speed of a fly? Why report on the plumbing repairs in the White House? The point to be made here is that, when a given utterance has been artificially taken out of context (or rather out of its context), those features of the world as we normally take it to be and our usual expectations of our world insofar as these are relevant to the utterance, serve as an implicit context determining our interpretation (what I called earlier, an "implicit frame"), be it literal or metaphorical, and belie the claim to the intelligibility of context-free sentences. Because we, in fact, draw on these background assumptions and because the beliefs and knowledge we bring to bear on the presumably context-free sentences are so much in the background, we tend to think that our interpretation is context-free. Again, children's jokes illustrate the prevalence of such background presumptions. For example: 17. Ques: On which side of the house should you plant a tree? Ans: On the outside. Ques: Why is Big Bird standing on one foot? Ans: Because if he picked up the other he would fall. The children's riddles are riddles only because they pose as prob lematic, part of the background knowledge which is normally unstated. In tripping us up, they show us how dependent we are on such background for the ordinary interpretation we give to the questions posed. The surprise engendered by the answers to the riddles suggest that when we are not supplied with a sufficiently rich explicit linguistic context, we construe a context from the situation and from our background assumptions about the way the world is. And this is as true for literal as for metaphorical utterances. If metaphors appear more context-dependent than literal language, this is because so frequently metaphorical utterances, if taken literally, would assert or presume a state of affairs unlikely or impossible to be realized in the actual world and so call into question not only the meaning of the terms in the utterance, but also why one might want to issue such an utterance. Here we move more clearly within the province of pragmatic considerations, and most specifically into that area Grice has delineated with the notion of the Cooperative Principle. It will be well worth our while to explore this principle because it will help clarify the conditions necessary to identify an utterance as metaphorical.</page><page sequence="31">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 183 PRAGMATIC CONSIDERATIONS: THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE Amongst our assumptions and expectations are some which concern why a speaker may say what he or she does. Grice is undoubtedly correct in suggesting that the participants in a conversation, if they are to carry on a conversation in good faith, need to adhere to what he calls the Cooperative Principle, (henceforth CP) which he says is some "rough general principle" along the following lines: Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.35 Talk which follows along the lines of what Grice specifies as four maxims, that of Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Manner, will in general result in discourse with accords with the CP. We can briefly characterize these maxims as follows, Quantity: Give neither less nor more information than is required. Quality: Try to make your contribution truthful. Relation: Be relevant. Manner: Be perspicuous (by avoiding obscurity, ambiguity, etc.). Occasionally we cannot follow one maxim because doing so interferes with following another. Sometimes we want to mislead and will know ingly violate one maxim, assuming that our audience assumes we are following it. At other times we might not obey one or more maxims because we intend not to respect the CP. When it seems clear that a speaker is attempting to abide by the CP and yet appears to be flouting one of the maxims for none of the above reasons, then Grice maintains, we must ask what is being implicated by the blatant violation of a maxim. Grice calls such a situation a case of conversational implicature. The jokes in 17 above illustrate that we do not normally answer a question with background information that is obvious to all and this is because we presume that a question is asked because there is some problematic to be addressed. The person who puts forth the riddle exploits one of the maxims (probably Manner) for the purpose of humor.</page><page sequence="32">184 EVA FEDER KITTAY I have claimed that the conceptual incongruity embodied in the IP and motivating the Special IAC is a necessary condition which an utterance must fulfill to warrant a metaphorical interpretation. It is not a sufficient condition, in part, because we must also decide if the speaker is adhering to the Cooperative Principle and (a point not mentioned by Grice but significant in the case that what is implicated is a metaphor) whether a term is simply being misused. In the latter case, an utterance made by a sufficiently non-proficient speaker may have a metaphoric appearance or quality but may be a mistake nonetheless. Walker Percy, in 'Metaphor as Mistake',36 recollects a hunting trip he took as a child, on which he saw a fascinating bird whose flight was breathtaking. The guide called the bird a "blue-dollar hawk". The boy learned later, to his great disappointment, that the bird was called a "blue-darter" hawk. Children tend to make the most poetic mistakes. While sitting in a good Italian restaurant, I overheard an seven-year-old boy, seemingly of boarding-school breeding, complain that unlike the spaghetti sauce served here, the one at school was always "blunt". His mother corrected him: "bland", "No", he insisted, "blunt, the way a knife is blunt." The difference between a food critic and this young boy assessing a tomato sauce as "blunt" is the difference between using the term metaphorically and using it (however charmingly) literally, but incorrectly. Finally, there are the amusing errors of the winningly pretentious fool, Mrs. Malaprop. In a remark which ought to be about prodigies, she states "I would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning."37 These are all instances of utterances where the speakers were not intending to violate a conversational cooperative principle and where the utterance was intended as meaningful and literal speech, but which simply fails as such. A speaker may want to "opt out" of the conversation, that is, refuse to be bound by the Cooperative Principle. This can be done by some version of "I can say nothing more" or by speaking nonsense: putting together words and sentences which are perhaps syntactically well formed, but by which one means to say nothing at all. Where the speaker is not sufficiently competent in salient regards, or when she or he has opted out of the conversation, no conversation implicature can arise, in particular, no metaphor can be implicated. Therefore, the identification of an utterance as a metaphor also</page><page sequence="33">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 185 supposes, as a necessary condition, that we have the circumstances in which a conversational implicature can arise; this is the situation in which, as Grice says, the speaker appears to "flout" some maxim of the CP. In the case where a maxim of quality, relation or manner is flouted, whereby an incongruity arises within an utterance, or between a constituent of that utterance and the remaining constituents, satisfying the IP (and, in the strong thesis, so satisfying the IP that the violated sc-conditions are, in fact, selection restrictions) or if the utterance is lacking this incongruity but is subject to two interpretations satisfying the IAC, we have some of the necessary conditions for an utterance to be identified as metaphorical. REINTERPRETING LANGUAGE - REINTERPRETING OUR WORLD However, the satisfaction of all these conditions is not yet sufficient to warrant such a metaphorical identification. An utterance may fulfill these conditions, and the correct interpretation may still be a literal one. When a maxim appears to have been violated, but we decide that the speaker is still adhering to the CP we still have to decide whether we ought to construe the speaker's words in other than in their literal senses or whether we are required to suppose that the world (actual or possible or perhaps even impossible) to which the statements apply (or the world which they presuppose) is significantly different from the world we ordinarily take it to be. For example, although we remarked that the sentence 10 is odd, it is nonetheless possible that it be interpreted (and intended to be interpreted) as a literal statement. There are possible situations in which we could correctly interpret 10 so that the sensesLC of each of the constituents are preserved. We might suppose that (a) the sentence occurs in an actual or fictionalized account of an unusual occurrence in which the mammal, for some reason, appears in an office and 10 is a purported description of its exiting. (b) the sentence occurs in a fairy tail in which (1) a seal, in the sense of an animal, is portrayed as carrying on a rather anthropomorphic existence, on the model of Westernized, industrialized society, putting in a day's work at the office;</page><page sequence="34">186 EVA FEDER KITTAY (2) a seal, in the sense of an imprinting device, is made animate, (Walt Disney style) and drags itself out of the office in which it is stored. In case (a), we have neither a radical reconstrual or the world nor any meaning change at all. However, our normal expectations of the sorts of beings found in offices are not met - instead we have a rare and unexpected event in the world we are familiar with. Notice that all the words in 10 retain their literal senses.38 In case (b), as in fairy tales generally, we have to suspend disbelief and accept a world picture substantially different from our usual one. We allow for a suspension of physical and biological laws so that sea lions function in offices and waxen seals are animated and move about. To be able to speak of such a mixture of the alien and the familiar, the familiar must maintain its resemblance to what we know and yet take on some features of what is normally alien to it. The meaning of certain key terms must be modified in light of their new setting. For example, we would implicitly add a marker (Animate) to "seal" in (b)2 and add some human-like marker to "seal"; or delete a restriction (HUMAN) for office worker in (b)l. But these reinterpretations are not metaphori cal.39 In fairy tales and other accounts, where the world is presumed to be quite different from our own, the reinterpretation of language is limited to incorporating necessary modifications in our background assumptions. Within this modified conception of our world, language is used quite literally and metaphor, when present, constrasts with literal language within the modified world view. Allegories, in this regard, should probably be classed with fairy tales rather than with metaphor, and both should be viewed as within the scope of first-order meaning. When allegories get reinterpreted for their allegorical message then we must consider them as having a second-order meaning. In attempting to construct an account of the interpretation of metaphors we must be able to distinguish metaphor from such modified though still literal meaning found in fairy-tale language.40 A metaphorical interpretation, I want to suggest, involves a more radical reinterpretation of the language used than is the case where we revise or suspend our empirical beliefs along with some concomitant semantic change. The conceptual incongruity which signals a metaphor must be captured in the metaphorical reading we give an utterance.</page><page sequence="35">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 187 The reinterpretation that 10 receives in (b) above is still within a first-order meaning - the conventions of the language used have been somewhat modified in a way understandable to the hearer and the language is used literally within the new conventions. This is similar to a technical adoption of terms. In set theory, for example, the terms "nest" and "chain" are governed by specific conventions which are different from those governing their more common uses but which employ certain elements of their literal use (some features are deleted, others are added). Once we adopt the conventions specific to the terminology of set theory, there is no incongruity involved in the use of the terms "nest" and "chain". Compare the technical use of such a term as "chain" in set theory with its use in 18, where the very incongruity is put to service. 18. "Man was born free but is everywhere in chains." (/. J. Rousseau) What I have said then is that when we are faced with a syntactically well-formed unit which appears semantically or empirically odd, we must decide first whether we keep our expectations of the world fixed and change the meaning of the words, or second whether we change our expectations of the world and keep the meaning fixed. Sometimes a third choice seems appropriate: to modify our expectation of the world and alter the meanings, of words, but only insofar as the modified conception of the world demands. We choose the third option when we read fairy tales though we do not take the modified conception to be applicable to the actual world. It may be that in periods of scientific change the latter occurs as well, only then the revisions concern our theories about the actual world. The second choice involves the assimilation of new information that may surprise us but does not force a conceptual change. Such conceptual change is appropriate when the oddity is one which, in suitable circumstances, yields metaphor: we utilize first-order meanings incongruously strung together to guide us to a second-order meaning. My conjecture is that this choice is appropriate only where there is a genuine conceptual oddity. The reorganization of meaning that the conceptual oddity forces may also, in the end, direct us to a new conception of the world, either to new theories about the actual world or to a new vision of the world as reflected in a poem or novel.</page><page sequence="36">188 EVA FEDER KITTAY CONVENTIONAL METAPHORS Notice that when we defined meaningLC, we said that first-order mean ing was both the literal and conventional meaning of the utterance, and while the two coincided in the case of utterances belonging to the set U?, they did not necessarily coincide in utterances that belonged to Un where n &gt; 0. Since we can only speak of metaphorical meanings in utterances, Un, where n&gt;0, conventionalized metaphors do not belong to first-order meaning, although a lexical entry for a given term may include a metaphorical sense a given word has attained through repeated usage in related metaphorical utterances. And yet to claim that conventionalized metaphors require an analysis such as the one extracted above and summarized below, seems otiose. Moreover, insofar as much of our language is the repository of worn-out metaphors, as Nietzsche, Derrida (1975) and most recently Lakoff and Johnson have well demonstrated, it would require that the elaborated second-order interpretation is required for a major part of our lan guage. What would have a second-order meaning, logically speaking, would then have a certain linguistic priority. Furthermore, for the practical purposes of everyday speech they seem to require an analysis suited for first-order signification. Conventionalized metaphors, rather than simply having second order meaning, seem instead to be hybrids in the schema I have outlined. With Goodman's (1968, 1978) metaphor of conventional metaphors as "naturalized citizens", we can view language as a sort of New World in which natives are no longer more plentiful than the naturalized citizens. For all practical purposes of citizenship, the naturalized citizen and the native are not to be distinguished. But the cultural character of the land with a heterogeneous population is distinct from those with homogenized populations. Similarly, a logical analysis of language can seem to ignore the divers origins of the language which.functions well according to first-order rules, although it misses the texture and richness of the language. One logical point remains, however, for the very idea of citizenship requires the concept of a priordial homeland for the population of varied origins. Out of this consideration comes the fact that no matter how "dead" or con ventional, such utterances are metaphors nonethless. This may be seen by the ease by which their metaphorical origins may be called forth. Few metaphors seem as dead and worn-out to us as the "leg of a table";</page><page sequence="37">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 189 within the purview of Victorian sexual prudery this phrase is revivified, replete with salacious meaning - Victorians regarded it necessary to cover tables with long tablecloths to avoid the indecency of viewing exposed "limbs". The conventional metaphor may then be viewed either as falling within first-order analysis when its dormant double semantic import either is fully forgotten by the generally competent speaker (a genuinely dead metaphor) or is for practical linguistic purposes safely disregarded. It requires a second-order analysis when it carries the burden of its double semantic import, that is when it is placed in a setting in which its original literal meaning is highlighted and is seen as incongruous in the context of the utterance. CONCLUSION When we can judge from the contextual features of an utterance, that the utterer adequately executed her or his intentions in making the utterance (i.e., did not make any mistakes) and was adhering to the Cooperative Principle, then if one of the maxims is flouted (or what amounts to the semantic realization of this pragmatic principle, if the IP or the IAC is fulfilled) and the context gives us no reason to suspect that our normal expectations and conception of the world do not remain in tact, then we can perhaps best make sense of the utterance by abandoning the meaningLC of some of the terms of the utterance. If 10 occurs in a context such that the movements of a human office worker are being discussed and there is no other reference to any large mammals or animated waxen seals about, then we would be required to presume that, if the speaker was adhering to the CP and was a competent speaker of the language, we must take some term, presum ably "seal"41 to be understood in a nonliteral, nonconventional sense, and to see the Incongruity Principle operative in this discourse. To reiterate, the following conditions must be met if we are to decide whether an utterance (in a given language) be metaphorically inter preted: A. Conditions on the Presumed Utterer: That she or he is a competent speaker of the language, is not in this utterance making an error and is adhering to the CP, so that if the utterer flouts a maxim the audience is warranted in conclud ing that a conversational implicature has arisen.</page><page sequence="38">190 EVA FEDER KITTAY B. Conditions on the Context: That there is nothing in the context to persuade us that the world to which the utterance applies is substantially different from our own, or that the usual expectations we have are not to be met. There is nothing in the context to persuade us that the conventions of our discourse have been altered in specifiable ways (e.g., as in technical language). C. Conditions on the Utterance: That the utterance, taken along with its context, displays a discernible oddity or (an inclusive or) is announced to be metaphorical so that (i) if there is an oddity, it arises from the incongruity of a term which is a constituent of an utterance of a higher order of complexity (ii) either a first-order interpretation of the utterance yields violations expressed in the Principle of Incongruity and/or the IAC principle is operative. (iii) where the IP is effective, the incongruent elements belong to at least two distinct semantic fields; where the IAC principle holds, the independence of applicability conditions is related to the divergent semantic fields appropriate to the different things talked about. D. Conditions for the Strong Thesis: That where the IP is effective, the sc-rules violated are selection restrictions. Clearly, in our actual practices, we do not examine each term to see if conditions A - D obtain. As I pointed out above, in the case of conventionalized metaphors the whole process of metaphorical identification and interpretation is short-circuited and they generally function as first-order discourse, although they retain their metaphori cal potential. The process of identification of metaphors also involves a less complex procedure if any of the conditions are met in a particularly strong fashion. For example, in a newspaper article discussing 16, "Nixon's plumbers", condition B is so strongly fulfilled that a simple first-order interpretation is clearly inadequate. This is apparent to any adult English speaker who is even poorly acquainted with American politics and the contents of political news coverage. Nonetheless, even when a competent speaker announces that his utterance is metaphorical</page><page sequence="39">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 191 or when the utterance appears to be a conventionalized metaphor or when some of the conditions are met with special force, if it turns out that the utterance, viewed in sufficiently rich context does not meet all three (or four) sets of conditions, we would revise our identification of that utterance as metaphorical. The last point is crucial to understanding my insistence that the aim of this paper is conceptual and not psychological. Conditions A - D are not to be understood as a description of actual psychological processes speakers undergo when they identify an utterance as metaphorical, but rather a conceptual analysis of what is required of the utterance and its accompaning circumstances for us to correctly characterize an utterance as a candidate for a metaphorical reading. Psychologists (see Ortony, et al., 1978, Glucksberg, Gildea and Bookin, 1982, and Gildea and/ Glucksberg, unpublished), basing their views on time studies indicating that the processing of metaphorical utterances does not require any more time than the processing of comparable literal utterances, have criticized theories proposing that metaphorical language involves extra identifying and interpreting procedures. But these criticisms do not apply to my position since the 'extra' identifying 'procedures' I del ineate above and the 'extra' interpreting 'procedures' I espouse with the view that metaphor is a second-order signification, are not put forth as psychological processing procedures capable of being measured in such studies. They are not procedures at all, but criteria for the identification of a certain sort of utterance.42 The studies in question do not undertake to examine the time required for less common and more complex metaphors. It may well be that these do require additional processing time. While questions concerning the psychological pro cedures are ones philosophers must pay attention to if they are not to make false claims for their own theories, one can still separate out a conceptual issue here which is independent of such findings. Given the subtlety of linguistic circumstances surrounding discourse which exhibits oddity (when the oddity is construed within the scope of a first-order signification), I think it unwise to claim that the above gives us both the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying a metaphor. What, for example, do we make of surrealist Andr?e Breton's (1972, p. 57) title of a series of poems on automatic writing, poems which accompany his Manifestes du surr?alisme: 19. "Poisson soluable" (Soluble Fish)?</page><page sequence="40">192 EVA FEDER KITTAY The phrase, as a title, shares the apparent "contextless" of other titles, and more so than most since the poems do little to elucidate the phrase. It is a metaphor? If it is not a metaphor and if A - D are conjointly sufficient conditions, 19 would have to fail at least one such condition. I do not believe 19 is a metaphor and yet it is hardly clear which of these conditions it fails to meet. Let us presume that A is met. Conditions B and C(i), (ii) seem easily fulfilled. Only C(iii) and D are questionable. Are 'soluble' and 'fish' from two different semantic fields? Are there selection restrictions on "soluble" and "fish" so that D is fulfilled? If we presume "fish" to be live swimming fish, rather than dead fish or fish-shaped candy, fish tattoos, etc. (ambiguities to which animate nouns are generally subject), it cannot properly collocate with "solu ble" for the obvious reason that what we understand by fish is a species which lives in water, something not possible of what is both animate and soluble. Of course we can play on the ambiguities cited and use fish in 19 above to mean fish in some other sense than live and swimming fish and we can use the sense of "being able to be solved" rather than "that which dissolves in liquid" and arrive at wonderful texts in which both terms are sometimes used literally, sometimes metaphorically or other wise figuratively (see note 43 in notes). If we eschew such inter pretations for the moment and rely on the sort of implicit context titles force us to adopt, the phrase has an incongruity which is still more radical than that of metaphor generally. As real live fish cannot both be fish and be soluble it is closer to the paradox of the oxymoron; it is a self-destructing incongruity. Can we identify the phrase then as metaphor? Here our intuitions are still too weak. The phrase, in spite of the necessary conditions A - D, leaves us puzzled as to its status as a metaphor. In the Manifesto itself (1972, p. 49) 19 appears in the text: 20. Poisson soluable, n'est-ce pas moi le poison soluable, je suis n? sous le signe des Poissons et l'homme est soluable dans ses pens?es! La faune et flore du surr?alisme sont inavouables. (Soluble fish, am I not the soluble fish, I am born under the sign of the Fish and man is soluble in his thoughts! The fauna and flora of surrealism ought not to be spoken of.) In the line, "am I not the soluble fish," we readily identify "soluble fish" as metaphorically used to speak of the self-referential I - the writer of the essay cannot literally be a fish, whether soluble or insoluble.</page><page sequence="41">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 193 The attribution of soluble to fish appears to be mediated by a symbolic (though not metaphorical) identification of "I" with the astrological sign, the Fish (Pisces), and by a conception of man as "soluble in his thoughts" (soluble as "dissolvable" or as an enigma which is to be "solved"?). The two notions join in the attribution of soluble to fish. We might say that the conception of man as "soluble in his thoughts," is literal if we think of man solely in the attribute of thought - the Cartesian thinking thing, the unavowable thinking thing revealed in automatic writing. If we take soluble as "able to be solved" then the view that man is "soluble in his thoughts" may be seen to embody as sort of enthymeme to be filled in as follows: Man, as such , is a mystery, an enigma, that which has not been avowed or voiced but reveals himself in his thoughts and thus through the process of automatic writing - an uninhibited revelation of his thoughts - the mystery can be solved or, again, be dissolved. Thus although 20 is clearly a metaphor, the status of the phrase, even as it appears in 20 remains problematic.43 Whether or not conditions A - D are jointly sufficient, they do, as necessary conditions, focus on the crucial considerations, and at the very least delimit the class of phenomena to which metaphor may belong. Furthermore, I suspect that no sufficient conditions can be given for metaphor as long as we confine ourselves to a discussion of first-order phenomena, for, the comprehension of metaphor requires a function of the first-order meanings of the constituents of an utterance. A sufficient condition would need to posit the availability of just such a function for a given utterance in a given context. But within first-order meaning, we have no way to represent such a function. Therefore, the best we can hope for at this point of the inquiry is a list of conditions which are necessary to identify an utterance as a candidate for such second-order interpretation as will result in metaphor. That is what conditions A - C (with D in the strong version) are meant to delineate. NOTES 1 I would like to thank those who read and commented on earlier versions of the paper, Adrienne Lehrer, Daniel Hausman, Michael Simon, Rita Nolan, Patricia Athay, Richard Grandy, and the reviewer for their important contributions. This paper has been partially supported by a grant from the SUNY University Awards Program. 2 Kittay (1978). See bibliography therein. Also Lakoff and Johnson (1980). 3 It has been called to my attention that we may be wrong in supposing that this phrase is</page><page sequence="42">194 EVA FEDER KITTAY metaphorical. The ingenious reviewer of this article suggested the following passage in which both "slum" and "bloom" are to be understood literally, if we take the definition of "bloom" to be "a lump of puddled iron" {The New Webster Dictionary of the English Language): The rioting in the South Bronx went out of control. The rioters set fires everywhere, and the conflagration was beyond imagining. Automobiles and even the metal girders which had formed the framework of some of the tenements melted. Through the flames one could see that the South Bronx had been reduced to nothing more than the slum of bloom and ash. This example is intended not so much to show that the sentence is a preferable unit of metaphor but only "that context is essential for identifying either literal or figurative language," which is precisely the point I want to make in this paper. But my point in citing the phrase "slum of bloom" is that, even in the absence of a wider context the phrase suggests the incongruity characteristic of metaphor, but the incongruity supposes that we are implicitly working with a commonly understood meaning of "bloom" e.g., "the flowering state." When a wider context is not specified, we tend to assume that the meanings of the words employed are those most commonly known, and that the context is a situation easily conceived of by speakers of the language and members of that particular language community. On such an assumption, "slum of bloom" defies a simple literal interpretation and hence is generally identified, mininally, as nonliteral. 4 Michael Reddy (1969), 240-51. 5 Linguists and philosophers of language have, as a rule limited their investigations of meaning to word-meanings and sentence-meanings. Talk of "texts", have, within the received canons, been viewed with suspicion. For example, see Marcelo Dascal and Avishai Margalit (1974), 195-213. The argument against a text-grammar is that, in theory, any group of sentences can be written as a single sentence connected by conjunctions, thus rendering extra-sentential grammars superfluous. Those favouring text-grammars have pointed to the difficulty of conjoining non-declarative sentences such as imperatives and questions and in grasping the point of sentences beyond certain conventionally accepted lengths (though such accepted conventions differ from language to language and even within a language from one group of speakers to another). Furthermore, there exists a literature which is, at least, prima facie, interesting in what it reveals about how sentences cohere in a text. Even if we grant that ultimately we need only a sentence grammar, we may still want to explain why some sets of sentential conjuncts (or disjuncts) have a cohesive character, while others do not. It is here that the work of "text-grammarians" would be able to illuminate the work of "sentence grammarians", even if the latter were to insist on the primacy of the sentence. 6 For some arguments that metaphor is not a matter of semantics at all, but strictly a matter for pragmatics, see J. Saddock (1979) and Davidson (1978). 7 Paul Grice (1969), 147-50. 8 What is deemed appropriate is that meaning which coheres with the linguistic and situational context of the utterance. If I look at my watch and mutter something to the effect that I had not realized how late it was, and then say "Time flies," it would be obtuse of some listener to respond by taking out a stop watch so as to time the speed of a fly buzzing overhead. To assume that I was issuing an imperative to clock the speed of the fly would be to assign the inappropriate timeless meaning to the words "time" and "fly" as</page><page sequence="43">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 195 well as to their concatenation in the sentence, "Time flies." Notice that these applied timeless meanings would be inappropriate even though what would, in fact, be the appropriate timeless meanings of the words "time" and "flies" yields what is, literally speaking, a nonsensical sentence, i.e., time, in the sense of the substantive noun, does not in any literal sense move through the air with wings. 9 John Searle (1979a) pp. 30-57 and (1979b) pp. 76-117. I ? I reserve this discussion for my book in progress, The Cognitive Force of Metaphor. II Katz and Fodor (1963). There have been important modifications in the original projection rules postulated by Katz and Fodor. Certainly we would want to adopt the version which is the most well-considered to date. 12 See Adrienne Lehrer (1974) and John Lyons (1968), also Lyons (1977). 13 It is useful to consider the relation between the a and y-components. If we take the concepts in a as indicating concepts which also belong to terms with which the given term groups or contrasts in various interesting ways, we can say that those terms would comprise the particular lexical sets to which the term belongs. Thus it may be that the semantic field can be generated from the ?-element alone. What is not capable of being so generated are the particular sense-relations which characterize the way in which the elements in a group relate. I want our sense representation to somehow capture these relations and hence a term's "position" in a semantic field. Although it is by no means obvious how this should be done, the inclusion of y -component is intended to capture the import of these considerations. 14 The application of a set of lexical items to such areas or domains allows us to speak of distinct concepts which stand in certain specifiable relations to one another. Because these domains yield a set of concepts when a set of labels is applied to them, I will call them conceptual domains. It ought to be understood, however, that I do not presume a pre-existent set of concepts which need only to be named by labels. Rather, I am presuming, though nothing in particular in this discussion hinges on it, that distinct concepts only emerge in the symbolic articulation of a domain of interest or concern. (Without this presumption, however, many of the notions I articulate here might seem otiose.) 15 Lehrer (1974). 16 See Kittay (1978) and Kittay and Lehrer (1981). 17 J. J. Katz (1971), p. 298. 18 More formally, we can represent the process of obtaining an interpretation of ux e Un where n &gt; 0: Some projection rule, (/&gt; operates on the lowest level constituents of ux,uae U?, ub e U? etc., bracketing these together, according to the appropriate syntactic rules. We select some interpretation for each lower level constituent which the appropriate projection rule combines so that the sc-conditions are met with respect to all u e Um (m &lt; n) - which are constituents of ux. We proceed similarly with all u e JJm+l which are constituents of ux until we arrive at an interpretation of uxe Un. The constituent relation is such that ux is a constituent of uy = df (1) where ux e Um and uy e Un, then m &lt; n; if m = n then ux = uy. (2) if more than one constituent is represented, they may each be on the same level of complexity, one which is lower than that of uy or they may themselves be hierarchically ordered; in the latter case, either they are all of a level of complexity lower than that of uy or they are all lower than the last constituent</page><page sequence="44">196 EVA FEDER KITTAY which may be identical to uy ; that is, in the case of multiply constituents, they cannot each be equal in their level of complexity to uy. (3) I will not consider terms in opaque contexts (e.g., direct quotes) as constituents of an utterance. The constituent relation is transitive, asymmetrical (except where m = n) and reflexive. We can say that the first-order interpretation of an expression ue Un is gotten by proceeding from the bottom up, from the lowest level to the highest level constituents. But interpretations at the lower levels are only partial until the projection rules have operated so as to properly combine the units. In so doing, various possible interpretations of lower level units are rejected as not combinable with certain possible interpretations of other lower level constituents. One can say, then, that the particular senses given to lower level constituents on a given interpretation of the discourse of which it is an element are also determined from the top down. This is especially important in determining, in a particular applied timeless meaning, to which semantic field a word belongs. This decision is contrained, hence partially determined, by the dictionary assignment of the lexical item, but is progressively more constrained by the higher level utterance into which the term enters. If all lower level units comprising ue Un (n &gt; 0) have been interpretedLC successfully (preserving the literal and conventional senses of the words), we get the set of concepts, a, that comprises the first element in the order three-tuple (a, ?, y), a ? -component which include the sc-rules for u and which are some function of the sc-rules for the constituent elements of u and a specification of the semantic fields of the constituents of u, that is a specified y -component. 19 I do not assume that the expressibility principle demands one unique, correct linguistic rendering of such a nonlinguistic context, only that there be at least one adequate linguistic rendering of nonlinguistic salient features which participants in the discourse could agree to, given their good faith and essential rationality. 20 That a group of sentences cohere as a text is generally, though not always intuitively apparent. Such a group may be more or less recognizable as a text, or may be a text only by virtue of some 'external' requirement, e.g., exercises in an English grammar textbook. See Margalit and Dascal (1974). Our interest here only concerns questions of coherence, and hence we are not concerned with texts which might not be recognizable as such solely through their appeal to our intuitive sense of their coherency. 21 Halliday and Hasan (1976). 22 For the sake of orthographic simplicity, I have not given here the superscript of the class to which u belongs that would indicate the increasing levels of complexity of the utterances, so that ua e U? and ux e U?, ub e Um and uy e Um and uz e Un and n &gt; m &gt; 0. Normally ua and ux are constituents of sentences ub and uy, respectively, and ub and Uy follow one another so as to be (or be part of ) a text uz. 23 Max Black (1962). In this seminal work, Black took the frame to be a complete sentence of which the focus was a constituent word or phrase. In keeping with our rejection of the sentence as the metaphorical unit, we are generalizing the notions of focus and frame. 24 Grice (1969) calls an utterance-type "complete" if it is a sentence or, in the case of nonlinguistic utterances, if it is something which is "sentence-like" such as a hand-signal.</page><page sequence="45">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 197 An "incomplete" utterance-type is a nonsentential word or phrase, or a nonlinguistic analogues. Grice does not justify his use of the terms "complete" or "incomplete" but I gather that he must mean something like syntactically or semantically self-sufficient. Sentences are always syntactically complete in this sense. In the case of nonlinguistic utterances not ruled by any recognizable syntactic considerations, we would have to look for a sense of semantic self-sufficiency such that the utterance can be understood in and of itself. I extend the notion of a "complete" and "incomplete" utterance-type to metaphorical utterances so that a metaphorical utterance is complete if is recognizable as one. Since the units of metaphorical discourse are not necessarily coincident with grammatical units, metaphorical completeness need not be coincident with syntactic completeness. 25 Katz (1971), pp. 91-92. 26 See, for example, Weinreich (1966). 27 A preferred sense would be determined by some utterance of which y is a constituent. 28 We can alternatively speak of the metaphorical sentence, "The garden was a slum of bloom" in which case we can speak of a similar type of violation of sc-rules between 'garden' and 'slum'. If we consider only the phrase "slum of bloom", its actual grammatical analysis is, as Adrienne Lehrer has pointed out (in a personal com munication) "tricky, since it is not completely clear what the head is - bloom, in which case a slum of is similar to a quantifier expression (e.g., a cup of coffee), or slum, in which case of bloom is a prepositional phrase modifying it." See the passage quoted in note 3 for an example of the latter. 29 In 12' the categorical identification of 12(H) is captured in the metaphoric reference relation between "that plumber" (in 12'(i)) and "Smith" (in 12'(ii)); in 12' the two phrases have an anaphoric relation. 30 One example, suggested by Rita Nolan (in a personal communication) needs con sideration. Let us say that, during a war, medics in submarines are permitted to do surgery in emergency cases and that aboard one sub there are two medics, one a plumber, the other a mechanic, who may do surgical procedures. We can imagine some of the crew referring to these different medics by their nonmilitary occupations and therefore speaking of "the mechanic's patient" or "the plumber's patient" in a nonmetaphorical fashion, that is, giving a first-order interpretation to these phrases. Counter to the statement made above, within this context there appears to be no incongruity in speaking of "the plumber's patient". In the story I propose in the text speakers and audience alike know or at least can presume, given ordinary circumstances where surgeons rarely moonlight as plumbers and vice versa, that the person referred to is not a plumber but a surgeon. In the current context where the usual circumstances do not prevail, "plumber" is used to pick out or identify one individual among others who might be similarly characterized, e.g., as medics cum surgeon. But notice it is not through the attribution of Smith as a plumber, qua plumber, that he possesses patients. If a hearer would so interpret "the plumber's patients", he would be incorrectly construing the phrase in this context. This situation seems to parallel, though it does not quite coincide with the distinction Donnellan makes between the attributive and the referential use of a definite description. According to Donnellan, (see Donnellan, 1977), a definite description, serving a referential function, need not be bound by the meaning of the terms in the description any more than are proper names so bound. Similarly, when we use "plumber" simply to designate a particular individual by a distinctive property, but one which bears no relation</page><page sequence="46">198 EVA FEDER KITTAY to the relevant properties which belong to him as he is a surgeon, the meaning of the distinctive property by which we gain referential access to the individual plays no role in these predications - it serves as a quasi-proper name. While Donnellan's distinction is a pragmatic and not a semantic one, the point being made here is semantic: it is qua plumber, i.e. given the concept of what it is to be a plumber, that an individual cannot have patients, in the first-order sense of plumber and patient. Thus when it appears that the context indicates that we can give the phrase "the plumber's patient" a first-order meaning it is only by virtue of the same linguistic function that permits us to continue to call a gray-haired but formerly red-haired person "Red"; that is, it is by treating the term as a quasi-proper name and thus disregarding its semantic features. 31 The fact that definite descriptions can be used in the manner discussed in note 30 may influence such considerations. 32 The utterance, uye Um, which serves as the context for uxe Uk may itself be embedded in a context, uze Un (k &gt; m &gt; n). In that case, uz is also a context for ux, but a richer one. 33 John Searle (1979d), pp. 117-36. 34 The psychological literature has been very instructive in its efforts to demonstrate the context dependency of our interpretations of utterances. In Tulving and Thomson (1973), the authors performed a number of experiments designed to show the role of context in recall tasks. In one, subjects were presented with a list of paired terms such as "white : black" They were then given another list that used some of the words in the previous list, but that were now accompanied by different words, for example "black" would appear accompanied by "train" rather than "white". Subjects were tovrecall which words on the second list had previously appeared on the first list. A second group of subjects were presented with a similar list of words, but ones which were not paired, and then with a second list which included words from the former list. Again subjects were asked to recall those words that had appeared on the second list and had also appeared on first. The results strongly indicated that the subjects in the first study would fail to recognize the words on the second list that had appeared in the first list, but that were accompanied by different terms in the second list, e.g., subjects would fail to recognize that "black" had appeared on the first as well as on the second list. When words were presented unpaired, subjects had far less difficulty recalling which words appeared for a second time. Apparently, the context of "white" as opposed to the context of "train" so significantly influences the subjects perception of the term "black", that the term itself was not recognized as the same. 35 Paul Grice (1975), p. 44. 36 Walker Percy (1958), pp. 79-99. 37 This self-referential error clues us to the fact that there is no chance that Mrs. Malaprop's stated wish would go unheeded. 38 Curiously, my intuitions tell me that this interpretation is the least likely people would give if asked to interpret 10 out of any given context. Perhaps, if we are forced to construe the world contrary to our expectations, we prefer to construe it as radically different so that it becomes possible only as a fantasy world. It is perhaps most difficult to imagine the actual world not meeting our expectations. 39 The addition and deletion of the semantic features of the constituents of an utterance has been regarded by many writers as the mark of metaphorical interpretation. Examples</page><page sequence="47">THE IDENTIFICATION OF METAPHOR 199 as the one above, indicate why such an account might be inadequate, and would certainly be incapable of providing a sufficient condition for metaphor. 40 Again this is a task not for the current paper but for an account of how we interpret metaphor, and one which I take up in the forementioned book. 41 The ambiguity of all metaphors is such that we must decide which is the frame and which the focus. In this case I have given enough of the context for the matter to be resolved. 42 Intuitively it appears to me that Lakoff and Johnson's views on the systematicity of metaphors may be able to account for the fact observed in these time studies, that commonly found metaphors and relatively simple metaphors, at least, are processed without any discernible time difference for comparable literal utterances, especially when they are cued by a context. The systematic relationship amongst metaphors, just as the systematic relationship between literal language terms doubtless facilitates our compre hension of metaphor in ways comparable to the way in which the interrelations amongst literal terms facilitates our choice of the proper interpretation of a given term in a given context. 43 I am grateful to the referee of this paper for calling to my attention the fact that the phrase, "by itself is not much of anything," and for supplying a set of imaginative interpretations of 19 which are too delightful to remain obscurely within a letter addressed to me. I cite some of these interpretations below. In light of these, I have amended the earlier discussion with the two settings in which the phrase is found, that is, the bare title of 19 and the passage in the Manifesto itself. A careful look at the latter yields interesting but still inconclusive results as to how to identify this phrase within its surrealistic context. This difficulty may say more about surrealism than metaphor, but it demonstrates the subtlety and seemingly infinitely protean nature of meaning which will force itself onto nearly any string of words. This is demonstrated, as well by the following passages invented by the referee: My friend, an unskilled cook, had some frozen fish which he wished to eat. Since he knew nothing of preparing food, he placed the frozen fish pieces in boiling water to cook. When he returned to the simmering pot an hour later, he could find no pieces of fish in the water, which had become cloudy and slightly thick. My friend drank the "fish soup" as he called it, and assumed he had discovered a product he had not known the existence of previously: he thought he had purchased some soluable fish. (Both "soluable" and "fish" meant literally.) [The writer speaks of a sailor who, after a night of drunken carousing, gets himself a tattoo of a fish. In the morning he showers and finds that the fish tattoo is gone.] He exclaims that his had been a soluble fish tattoo. (Again, both "soluble" and "fish" used literally.) None of the icthyologists could figure out the origins of the very odd fish which had been found in a stream in New Guinea. The problem was quite baffling and seemed to have no solution. But Kingsley solved the mystery and entitled her essay explaining the matter "the case of the soluble fish." ("Soluble" in the sense of "able to be solved" meant literally, "fish" meaning "problem regarding the origins of the fish in question" meant figuratively, not necessarily metaphorically.)</page><page sequence="48">200 EVA FEDER KITTAY Mathematics problems swim through my mind, like schools of fish.
