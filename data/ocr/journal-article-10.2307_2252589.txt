<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-NEW BOOKS Body and Mind. By KEITH CAMPBELL. London: Macmillan, 1971. Pp. 150 with bibliography and index. IN this monograph on the relation between mind and body Campbell is at his best when he is most polemical. It is in these circumstances that he best exemplifies the nature of the enterprise in the way that he would prefer to have it understood. His lively and energetic defence of a view that he nonetheless considers provisional is a defence that indicates the way in which 'different issues come to be linked together in philosophy' and leads us to an understanding of 'the right relations between science and philosophy'. The polemical side of the book will provide a way into philosophy for non-philosophers and beginners, for whom the book is presumably intended. The problem with which the book deals is embodied in the question: 'What is the relation, in a man, between his mind and his body? ' The traditional answers as well as Campbell's own provisional view are put in a disarmingly simple way which places the dilemma 'in a nutshell'. The rivals are considered in relation to four propositions, whose' incom- patibility is strictly logical ': (1) The human body is a material thing. (2) The human mind is a spiritual thing. (3) Mind and Body interact. (4) Spirit and matter do not interact. In this context, he considers the relative strengths and weaknesses of 'Interactionism', 'Parallelism', 'Behaviorism', 'Central-State Material- ism', and his 'new Epiphenomenalism '. The structure of the argument and the development of the discussion will be welcomed by the curious and will possibly provide a useful framework for the serious beginner. What bothers me is the introduction of isms even with a capital letter. Isms lead to schisms. And dogma which focuses on only a few hypotheses leaves us blind to the theory. Campbell does indeed give us some glimpses, but it is unfortunate that he does it without the aid of contemporary philosophers. It is not that he does not know the material, for the knowledgeable will see the spirit of contemporary disputes and will recognize the value of the bibliography. I am worried about the uninitiate to whom the discussion is directed. They will read Campbell's book without knowing the important contri- butions of people like Place and Smart let alone Putnam, Rorty, and Sellars, and I am afraid that their proper position in the framework will be un- recognizable because of its simplicity. We can only get the glimpses because the nutshell cracks under the strain of the larger theories, about which we are often left in the dark. We are forced to discard one of the incompatible propositions, which are said to 'have a good deal of initial plausibility'. By themselves, the hypotheses are difficult to assess for plausibility. We should not be pre- pared to place our bets on individual propositions when there are theories at stake. His concern with isolated propositions seems to lead Campbell to the view that 'after all, the world is full of surprises'. This leads to theories which accept the inexplicable, but if something happens unex- plained, the surprise is clearly on us. In a context where explanation has 469</page><page sequence="2">470 NEW BOOKS proven so difficuilt, it should not be rhetorically asked: ' What is more natural, then, but to conclude that the mind is not material?' It is either wrong or uninteresting or both that the ' initially most plausible explanation' for the differences between men and other material things 'is that men differ from material things in having a spirit responsible for what is distinctively human '. The problem is only more elusive when we are told that the ' search for a direct positive definition of " spirit " . . . is ... a failure'. If, as he tells us, 'spirits are methodologically elusive ', then it should be recognized that they are not even superfluous and have no place in our theories. As Campbell points out, spirits are duly banned by both behaviorism, which he unfairly suggests is held in common by Skinner and Ryle, and materialism, which is praised for showing that' as we ordinarily think about the mind, mental events and conditions and processes are at least the sorts of things which can be causes'. This is what I ordinarily think, but it is not clear that it is 'perfectly normal', nor do I know why Campbell has refrained from even alluding to the sometimes raging debate on this issue. It is more important that I enjoyed the book most and thought it best when Campbell argues for his own position, new epiphenomenalism or what he also calls ' Central-State Materialism Plus '. There are the begin- nings of a theory here, but unfortunately one which accepts the inexpli- cable. Through the felicitous example of what he calls an imitation man, he tries to show that materialism fails to account for the experiencing in experiences. His point is that ' everything the causal doctrine can say about pains is true of the imitation man whose pains never hurt '. My view would be that he ignores the centrality, and thus the complexity, of the materialism, although he explicitly maintains that the difference is not one of complexity. When he asks us to' think again of the imitation man, who duplicates all of a typical man's acquisition, processing, and retrieval of information, and all his activity, but for whom there are no phenomenal properties', I can do it but only if I ignore a whole theory of materialism with good standing. The imitation man also suffers from the problem that he could be anyone other than oneself. For Campbell, others can be undetected imitations, and this is the way he thinks it should be. This results from his new epiphenomenalism dividing the mind-body problem into 'two parts, one soluble and the other insoluble'. What is insoluble is the problem of accounting for the operations of the non-material, and Campbell is happy to leave the issue with a 'fundamental, anomalous, causal connection' relating bodily processes to some non-material processes. I thought this was where we came in, and it is certainly where I want to begin. Campbell will introduce many in this book to bits and pieces of philo- sophy and to some of his own theorizing, but I am dissatisfied that so much of the interesting theorizing in this area has been left out. I shall end by complaining about his approval that 'men, being concerned most with themselves, have concentrated chiefly on their own case '. Campbell might have said more about important studies of bees, frogs, and monkeys, but we should also eliminate such indications of male domination in philosophy. University of Calgary R. X. WARE</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS 471 Explanation in the Behavioural Sciences. Edited by ROBERT BORGER and FRANK CIOFFI. Cambridge University Press, 1970. Pp. xii+520. Price ?5. THIS, in every sense, substantial volume is a collection of papers written specially for it and something of a novel venture bringing a group of philosophers, psychologists and sociologists (and Chomsky) into ' con- frontation '. Happily the enterprise can be counted a considerable success. Not that there is all that much new in the way of ideas in these papers, since for the most part the contributors are content to present, elaborate on and relate lines of thought already expounded elsewhere, but the col- lection possesses appreciable value for all that. One of its great merits is that by bringing together so much in the general area of ' explanation in the behavioural sciences' the reader is enabled-or perhaps I should say forced-to see just how many-sided the issues are, how many interrelated problems and possible approaches exist, and is thereby prevented from falling into the trap of supposing that one or two moves or insights is adequate to furnish any real overall understanding or appreciation of the whole area. Each main paper takes up some general issue either of explanation per se or of its application to one of the behavioural or human sciences, and all manage to stay more or less relevant to the title theme. Behind it all lies, of course, the question of what sorts of explanation are appropriate to the various behavioural sciences and of how these relate to our everyday explanations of our own and each other's doings. So arise such issues as reductionism, whether of psychology vis-a-vis physiology: should psycho- logy have recourse to physiological knowledge or rather stick to its own self-contained molar explanations, or of sociology vis-a'-vis psychology: psychologism, methodological individualism versus collectivism, and all that. Above all, of course, there is the recurrent preoccupation with the question of scientific status or the lack of it in the various modes of ex- planation and their application. The book is organised as a series of twelve triads of main paper, Comment and Reply. The feature of the Replies is, I found, of particular value, not least in pinning the author of the main paper down where he is or seems to be evasive and providing answers to the question: I wonder what he would say to that? Often indeed one would like to have, but cannot reasonably complain at not having, a reply to the Reply. The opening confrontation is between two philosophers, Professors Toulmin and Peters on Reasons and Causes; this is followed by Charles Taylor and Robert Borger on The Explanation of Purposive Behaviour; next N. S. Sutherland poses the odd sounding question Is the Brain a Physical System? which John Grundy in fact finds too odd to take at face value; next D. W. Hamlyn and A. J. Watson confront each other on Conditioning and Behaviour, particularly in relation to the differences between conditioning and learning; John Watkins and Alan Donagan discuss the Rationality Principle under the heading Imperfect Rationality agreeing-as against a view expressed by Collingwood-that failures as well as successes are open to explanation by the historian; I. C. Jarvie attacks Peter Winch's views, as he understands them, on Understanding and Explanation in Sociology and Social Anthropology (Winch says that he has not understood them: however, it is evident that there is sub- stantial real disagreement here). There follow four confrontations in</page><page sequence="4">472 NEW BOOKS which the theme of reductionism figures prominently in some shape or other. J. 0. Wisdom and Robert Brown largely disagree over Situational Individualism and Emergent Group-Properties, Wisdom adopting and offering- an illustration of " transindividualism " which, in admitting unobservable and emergent properties, goes beyond what he calls Popper's " piecemeal reductionism " while still falling short of extreme collectivism or historicism; the two sociologists George C. Homans and Peter M. Blau discuss The Relevance of Psychology to the Explanation of Social Phenomena and here Homans espouses, in contrast to Wisdom and Blau, the reductionist belief that the general explanatory propositions of the social sciences are essentially psychological; R. W. Boakes and M. S. Halliday largely defend The Skinnerian Analysis of Behaviour against the strongly dissenting physiologising Karl Pribram; H. J. Eysenck and Dr. D. Bannister violently dispute over Explanation and the Concept of Personality, Bannister distrusting Eysenck's interest in the Ascending Reticular Activating System, in explanation of individual differences. (It is significant though that Eysenck, renowned for his advocacy of Behaviour Therapy, a method of treatment stemming largely from the work of Skinner, should be concerned with the 'throughput' of Skinner's methodologically empty organisms which suggests, what is surely the case, that utilisation of physiological knowledge can perfectly well be harmonised with the functional generalisations deriving from the peripheralistic behavioural approach.) Penultimately, comes a civilized discussion between Noam Chomsky and Max Black on Problems of Explanation in Linguistics, Black ably pin-pointing some of the objections facing Chom- sky's innateness-hypothesis. Finally, Frank Cioffi and B. A. Farrell entirely fail to agree over the issue of Freud and the Idea of a Pseudo- Science. Hopefully, the above list of contributors and paper-titles will give a fair clue to the scope and contents of the volume. Are there any points of agreement amongst all contributors? Well, one point which those who touch on the subject seem-with the possible exception of two unguarded asides from the two sociology contributors-all agreed and indeed insistent upon is that explanations of behaviour cannot possibly be given which restrict themselves to the internal workings of the brain: account must be taken of interaction with the environment, though disagreement begins when it comes to specifying the terms in which this interaction should or must be expressed. Characteristically, it is the philosophers as Toulmin, Peters, Taylor, Hamlyn and Winch who insist that these explanations must at some point make reference to the agent's reasons and the way he sees his situation, whereas the psychologist contributors are ready, in varying degrees, to uphold the view that intentional explanations be by- passed, superseded or demoted. Characteristically, too, the psychologists are inclined to dislike and distrust the a priori in principle restrictions which some philosophers wish to place on the possible forms of at least sufficient and full explanations of behaviour. Sutherland, for example, aims to " discover the underlying fallacy in the attempts that have been made to argue on a priori grounds that human behaviour must be explained in terms of quite different principles to those used in the explanation on inanimate physical systems ". Perhaps the clearest statement, in this volume, of the sort of conceptual argument Sutherland is attacking comes from Hamlyn who contends that " one cannot investigate the sufficient conditions of action by trying to find out what mechanisms are responsible for it; the most that one can find out in that way are the necessary</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS 473 conditions of action ". Hamlyn, in fact, concedes to Watson that a causally sufficient condition of certain actions might conceivably be found -Watson's case was of " identifying conditions so unpleasant that any adult person, given certain faculties will commit suicide rather than endure them "-but he none the less holds to the view that such a condi- tion, or alternatively some physiological state sufficient for a certain action, acquires intelligibility only if it " goes with something that really does make the action intelligible-that is to say an intention to perform that action ". The trouble with this point, so it seems to me, is that it is not made pro- perly clear how much depends on the very terms' action 'and' intelligible'; for it might indeed be taken to be analytically true that only intentional explanations are to count as rendering actions intelligible, or again that once the term ' action ' is employed then necessarily terms belonging to the same conceptual scheme as it must be used, on pain of mixing vocabularies. But then such linguistic points cannot of themse]ves exclude the possibility of alternative forms of explanation. Why should not the rat's lever-press- ing be said to be intelligible to Skinner in terms of its reinforcement-history, unless not by definition? Yet Hamlyn maintains that " The details that one needs when concerned with sufficient conditions are such facts as that the animal sees that pressing the lever produces food, that this is what it wants, and so on ". But to say this is to rule out of court a priori a con- tention like that of Thorndike that the Law of Effect operates mechanically rather than rationally. Hamlyn's thesis is that so-called operant or instrumental conditioning is a misnomer in that what goes under this name is so radically different from classical or Pavlovian conditioning, notably as involving things done rather than things like salivation which happen that it can only be misleading to use the term ' conditioning' for both cases. Now although Hamlyn is not alone in making this point it is not, I suggest, free from objection. To mention again the case of the rat. To insist that its behaviour in the Skinner-box must be explained in terms of re- constructing its " decision-scheme " (to use the terminology employed by Watkins of historical explanations) is to force a certain interpretation on what can be observed, and a somewhat anthropomorphic one at that. Again, to take a case of change in human behaviour, the question can arise of how best to describe a situation where, say, an alcoholic is being weaned off the bottle by means of electric shocks arranged to accompany indulgence. What is the (ex-)alcoholic supposed to have learned? That alcohol is horrid stuff, that it comes together with electric shocks, or what? At best one might say that he is learning to do without. But it seems to me that this difficulty of specifying just what has been learned, the element of success-grammar in the ordinary word 'learn' and the essential non- rationality of the method make the term ' conditioning' at least as ap- propriate as that of ' learning '. More congenial to psychologists should be the position of Charles Taylor. Taylor argues that far from being a conceptually decideable matter it is an empirical question what type of explanation will turn out to be on a more basic level than another. If causal-mechanical explanations were to be discovered from which our ordinary intentional explanations could be derived this would mean that our ordinary concepts and the way these ordinary explanations should be understood, would require drastic modi- fication. (But I think Toulmin misrepresents Taylor when he says that in such a case " our actions would ... become mere reflex bodily move- ments ": surely no competent philosopher is going to hold that!) In his Reply to Borger, Taylor picks up the former's 'revelation', " I am a</page><page sequence="6">474 NEW BOOKS mechanism. ", askinig " But how does he knowY " He suggests that Borger may have failed to distinguish between the plausible thesis that man is a material object, in the sense that all his mental states are embodied, froin the quite different thesis, that mechanism is true, that basic explanation must be in terms of efficient causes. One thing which emerges from a consideration of Taylor's position is the inadequacy of labels like 'compatibility thesis' and 'incompatibility thesis ' since in a sense mechanical and teleological explanations are compatible for Taylor, but not on the same level and unmodified. How- ever, both Borger and Toulmin argue for a greater degree of compatibility than that allowed for by Taylor. According to Toulmin " the idea of a 'mechanistic system ' capable of ' intentional action ' is nothing like the contradiction Taylor supposes ", whilst Borger wishes to take purposive behaviour as a datum which a model or blueprint in the form of a specifi- cation or instruction for the mechanism or structure of a man or machine exhibiting such behaviour would be called upon to account. " If building a human being is an impossibility, it is not a logical one. The pursuit of that goal, is a perfectly respectable interest, and the formulations arising from it constitute one approach to the explanation of behaviour." Toul- min argues for the compatibility of reasons and causes on the ground that though statements of reasons are quite distinct from statements of causes, the notion of an agent's having reasons, that is, " his recognition of those reasons as having weight for him in his particular situation " can be construed causally. This, I think, is a useful suggestion in solution of what Toulmin calls the " Cartesian problem " of understanding how reasons for acting can be relevant in a world where causality is universal. But it does not, as Peters points out, do much to show how physiological and 'his reasons' explanrations are related even though Toulmin claims to be tackling "the contemporary neurophysiological form of the Cartesian problem Finally, I will comment briefly on the extremely forthright and un- compromising attack which Cioffi makes on Freudian psychoanalysis. Cioffi, it seems, would have psychoanalysis ranged alongside such choice pseudo-sciences as Christian Science, Radiesthesia, Astrology and Pyra- midology. To claim that an enterprise is pseudo-scientific is for Cioffi " to claim that it involves the habitual and wilful employment of methodo- logically defective procedures (in a sense of ' wilful ' which encompasses self-deception) ", " it is not sufficient to show that the procedures it em- ploys would in fact prevent or obstruct the discovery of disconfirmatory states of affairs but that it is their function to obstruct such discovery ". Faced with this it is not surprising that Farrell should seek to rescue Freud from this company. Cioffi is evidently not convinced by the point which T. R. Miles in his book and Farrell here and elsewhere advance to the effect that failure to match up to full scientific status does not preclude some measure of rational method or of making some genuine contribution to science. For the point about the pseudo-sciences mentioned is, as Farrell remarks, that they are worthless; and this remains so even if Cioffi is granted that " A successful pseudo-science is a great intellectual achieve- ment. Its study is as instructive and worth undertaking as that of a genuine one ". Some explanation is required for the unquestionably greater contribution made to human thought by Freud in comparison with any of the recognised pseudo-scientists: and this presumably correlates with difference of method. Moreover, there is surely impressive evidence of Freud's essentially rational approach in the way he constantly adapted</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS 475 his theories in the light of new findings, as Wollheim's recent valuable book makes clear. At five pounds the book is not cheap, but it is much better produced and far richer in content than many of the works now appearing at around this inflated price. University of Keele C. V. BORST Between Philosophy and History: The Resurrection of Speculative Philo- sophy of History Within the Analytic Tradition. By HASKELL FAIN. Princeton University Press: Oxford University Press, 1970. Pp. 317. ?4-75. A GOOD deal of this book is taken up by a discussion of the nature of philosophy, considered in relation to its history. The author concludes that philosophy is concerned with " criteria for the intelligible application of concepts ". (Hegel, for instance, among other things " attempted to provide criteria of intelligibility for the concepts of state and freedom ".) Thus philosophical problems can arise in any context, and all disciplines have some philosophical content. Professor Fain argues that speculative philosophy of history cannot be distinguished in any precise way either from history on the one hand or from analytical philosophy of history on the other. Maybe not; but there are certainly some important differences of degree. If one distinguishes the speculative from the analytical by the degree of their dependence on the truth of some detailed statements about the course of history, this book is an entirely analytical work, and does little to live up to its rather pretentious subtitle. As regards history, Fain raises a number of knotty problems. Among them are: What sorts of entities can have histories? What makes a number of statements about events in chronological order into a story? Is there a concept of truth applicable to a whole historical work by con- trast with the separate statements contained in it? Is the historian's knowledge of an event necessarily inferior to that of eyewitnesses? (Fain gives good reasons for answering No.) He makes a good many sound points, particularly in criticism of other writers, anid for these the book is worth reading. But when closely studied it suffers from a lack of clear direction in the argument and, more seriously, of clear definition of some crucially important terms. For instance, Fain holds that in order to constitute a story, a series of incidents need not all concern the same entity, but must stand in a genetic relation to one another (causation is one form of genetic relation, but not the only form); but " genetic " is neither defined nor amply illustrated. Or again apropos of historical truth " One gets at the whole truth by arranging one's facts into a proper conceptual picture. The whole truth is the relevant truth; the facts, as reported, must fit together ". Certainly; but what makes a conceptual picture the " proper " one, and what sort of consideration the truth has to be relevant to, are not explained; instead, there is an analogy with jigsaw puzzles whose relevance is not made clear. In the definition of the subject-matter of philosophy, " criteria for the application of concepts " is pretty straightforward, but what " intelligible " adds to this is obscure. This key term turns up in other places. Fain</page><page sequence="8">476 NEW BOOKS says that historians seek not only to tell a story but to make that story " intelligible ". (He asks " Is history intelligible in Hegel's terms?") To say this is surely correct; but as there is no analysis of the kind (or kinds) of intelligibility involved, we are left with a problem rather than a solution. University of Birmingham C. H.
