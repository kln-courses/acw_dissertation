(SP-437) Front Drive Systems for Four-Wheel Drive Light Trucks. Martin J. Hermanns, Dana Corp., Spicer Front Drive Systems Div. This paper reviews the major components unique to light truck four-wheel drive systems and their effect on vehicle performance. It analyzes the tractive capabilities of four-wheel drive in comparison with front and rear drive under various load, grade, and friction conditions. The effects of different types of inter-axle differentials and the pros and cons of various front suspension and drive systems for 4 X 4's are also studied. 790003. Kinetic Modulus of Steel: A New Automotive Design Parameter. A. S. Kasper, W. E. Swenson, S. Dinda and F-L. Cheng, Materials Engineering, Chrysler Corporation. Successful automotive weight reduction with high strength-to-weight ratio steels has caused re-evaluation of the basic structural design parameters. This paper intro- duces the new concept of "Kinetic Modulus" which describes the nature of materials in motion. Kinetic modulus is influenced by stress and strain amplitude, yield strength and the number of loading cycles. The scope of kinetic modulus encompasses: elastic, secant, dynamic and tangent moduli; each of which is a specific case of kinetic modulus at a particular condition. Theoretical and experimental results are presented to support this concept. They show that high strength steel has higher dynamic stiffness and improved vibration response in structures as compared to that of lower strength steel. Thus, high strength steel ("Stiff Steel") can be used advantageously in stiffness controlled automotive structures to achieve greater weight reductions. 1979 SAE Transactions 790004. Prediction of Modulus Changes During Fatigue in HSLA Steels. R. B. Wilson, Inland Steel Re- search Lab., East Chicago, IN. Stiffness and vibration frequency of automotive structures are shown to be dependent upon an effective modulus. Under typical loading conditions the effective modulus would be much less than the elastic modulus. The concept of the effective modulus ratio is introduced as a dimen- sionless quantity to describe the change in apparent modulus. It is shown that HSLA steels, specifically HI-FORM 50 and HI-FORM 80, are less affected than AISI 1005 steel. 1979 SA E Transactions 790005. Spot Weldability of High Strength, Cold Rolled Steels. T. E. Fine and R. V. Fostini, Inland Steel Co. The increased usage of high-strength, cold-rolled steels has revealed differences in spot welding characteristics between the thin, high strength steels and the plain carbon steels commonly used in the automotive industries. The response of four, 275 MPa yield strength, cold-rolled steels to a variety of spot welding schedules was determined through an evaluation of mechanical property and fracture appearance tests. The results of this study were compared to various weld quality evaluation criteria and suggestions for a revised criteria were proposed. 790006. Spot Weldability of Dual-Phase Steel. B. Pollard and R. H. Goodenow, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., Graham Lab., Pittsburgh, PA. The spot welding characteristics of VAN-QN (80), a dual-phase HSLA steel, were examined with regard to the strength and ductility of spot welds under static, impact and cyclic loading and compared to a conventional V-N HSLA steel and SAE 1008 low carbon steel. The maximum tensile shear strength of VAN-QN (80) spot welds was found to be proportional to the thickness and ultimate tensile strength of the base metal. VAN-QN (80) spot welds, therefore, were only slightly lower in strength than those in a conventional 80 Ksi yield strength HSLA steel but up to twice the strength of welds in low carbon steel. Weld ductility was lower for VAN-QN (80) than for low carbon steel but greater than for conven- tional HSLA steel and increased with material thickness. The impact and fatigue properties of VAN-QN (80) welds were similar to those in conventional HSLA and low carbon steels. Weldability, as determined by the range of current over which acceptable welds could be produced, de- creased with increasing thickness and was the same for VAN-QN (80) as for low carbon steel. The excellent weldability of VAN-QN (80) steel is attributed to a combination of the following properties: (1) moderate hardenability, (2) insensitivity of the dual-phase micro- striicture to softening by the heat inputs typical of spot welding, and, (3) a low yield strength to ultimate tensile strength ratio. 790007. Properties of As-Rolled Dual Phase Steels. A. E. Cornford and J. R. Hiam, Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Canada); and R. M. Hobbs, BHP (Australia), Visiting Associate Professor, McMaster Univ. (Canada). Microstructure, mechanical properties, lab formability and ageing response of two as-hot-rolled dual phase steels, a heat treated dual phase steel, and microalloyed 345 MPa and 550 MPa (50 ksi and 80 ksi) steels are compared. Measurements and implications on press performance of: work hardening behaviour, strain rate sensitivity, elon- gation before necking, resistance to edge cracking, and uniformity of properties are discussed. Formability of both heat treated and as-hot-rolled dual phase steels was found to be similar at a common strength level, their formability lying between that of the 345 MPa and 550 MPa steels. 1979 SAE Transactions 790008. Metallurgy, Production Technology, and Prop- 19</page><page sequence="3">790009-790014 erties of Dual-Phase Sheet Steels. P. E. Repas, United States Steel Corp. Research, Monroe- ville, PA. The development of dual-phase (ferrite-martensite) micro- structures in hot- and cold-rolled sheet can be accom- plished by selecting the hardenability of the steel in relation to the particular thermal cycle used in processing. Intercritical continuous annealing of hot- or cold-rolled sheet when coupled with air- or accelerated-cooling rates can produce dual-phase microstructures in relatively low-alloy steels. In addition to the development of the required ferrite-martensite microstructure that produces a continuous stress-strain curve with low yield strength and high tensile strength, the development of enhanced ductility must be considered. The interrelationship among steel hardenability, processing conditions, microstructure, and mechanical properties is considered for both labo- ratory- and production-processed intercritically contin- uous-annealed sheet. 1979 SA E Transactions 790009. The Effects of Dynamic Strain Aging on the Mechanical Properties of Several HSLA Steels. J. A. Yaker, Air Force Weapons Lab., AFWL/DYBL, Kirtland AFB, NM; C.-C. Li, General Atomic Co., San Diego, CA; and W. C. Leslie, Dept. of Materials and Metallurgical Engrg., Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Eight high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels were dy- namically strain aged in the temperature range 1 00-600 °C, with strains from 1.5 to 6% and strain rates from 1 X 1CF4 to 2 X 10~2. Subsequently, changes in tensile, notch impact and fatigue properties were determined. The data indicate that in forming HSLA steels in the dynamic strain aging range, the temperature should be between about 250 and 400 °C, with the higher end of the range being preferred. The strain rate is unimportant. A dual-phase Mn-Mo-Cb steel gave the best response to this treatment. At the forming temperature, yielding was continuous and the rate of work hardening was more rapid than at room temperature. 1979 SA E Transactions 790010. Effect of Annealing Cycles on the Properties and Microstructures of Dual-Phase Steels. D. Aich- bhaumik and R. R. Goodhart, National Steel Corp. A study was undertaken to describe the effects of various annealing treatments, both intercritical and supercritical, on the mechanical properties and microstructures of six dual-phase, Mn-Si, Mn-Si-Cr, Mn-Si-Mo and Mn-Si-V steels having nearly equal hardenability. It has been found that the combination of tensile strength and total elongation after intercritical treatments may be slightly better than that after supercritical treatments. Although hardenabilities of these six alloys were more or less equal, it appears that the strength-ductility relationship varies a little (though not very significantly) with chemistry. The strength-ductility behavior of Mn-Si-Cr steels compares quite favorably with that of commercial Mn-Si-V steels with optimum processing conditions for both. It has been confirmed that the tensile strength of dual-phase steels is primarily a function of the hard-phase (mainly martensite and bainite, if any) 1979 SA E Transactions 790011.

The major areas covered are public transportation systems, railroad systems, highway systems, and personal trans- portation systems. The report suggests what future problems may be encountered in these areas that will need the attention of human factors specialists. 1979 SA E Transactions 790013. Efficiency Studies About Daihatsu Engine/Elec- tric Hybrid System. Shoji Honda, Chisato Hoshino, Shiro Kawakatsu, Hiromichi Tsukano, Toshikazu Yamamoto and Mikio lida, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). This computor simulation analysis has been tried as an efficiency study using the Daihatsu Engine/Electric Hybrid 1.5 ton truck which has the "DHS" systems, and run in accordance with three driving patterns such as U.S. LA-4, Australian eight and Japanese ten modes. All input data are measured and/or evaluated through the actual test and, for the selection of the four driving modes the "DHS" has, three cases of specific fuel consumptions of 190, 200 and 210 gr/PS gr/PS H h contour lines are used. As results, the accurate differences of the fuel consumption has been found under all cases. 790014. Fiat Research Center Hybrid Vehicle Prototype. L. Morello, R. Piccolo and L. Ippolito, FIAT Research Center (Italy). The scope of the hybrid propulsion systems studies that have been developed by FIAT Research Centre, is the energy consumption evaluation in comparison with conventional traction drives. After a general study on the hybrid propulsion systems, mathematical models have been developed for the evaluation of performances and energy balance. The construction of a prototype with parallel hybrid propulsion system has been completed to validate the computer simulation models. Computer and on road tests results are reported. Criteria used to select the parameters to the optim- ization of the system are discussed. 20</page><page sequence="4">790015-790021 790015. Mechanical Hybrid Vehicle Simulation. F. G. Willis, W. F. Kaufman and G. A. Kern, Scientific Research Lab., Ford Motor Co. A method is presented for optimizing the engine/sec- ondary usage strategy of a hybrid vehicle. A powertrain simulation is combined with dynamic programming techniques for calibration optimization, and a sequential decision algorithm for specifying optimal operating points for both engine and secondary drive systems. An overview of road-load matching and strategy requirements is presented. 1979 SA E Transactions 790016. The Application of Antioxidant Analysis to Transmission Fluid Testing. P. A. Willermet, L. R. Mahoney, S. K. Kandah and A. W. Sever, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity of new and used automatic transmission fluids can yield information useful in the study of fluid stability, severity of service and correlation between bench tests and service. The technique is particularly useful in the characterization of the earlier stages of fluid oxidation where parameters such as T.A.N., pentane insolubles and viscosity yield little information. Three fluids from a fleet test manifested different antioxidant decay profiles. Data obtained from a laboratory beaker test indicate that some test conditions can reproduce these decay curves and thus simulate the primary oxidation processes occurring in the transmission in this fleet. 790017. Automatic Transmission Fluid Oxidation - A Comparison of Short Term with Long Term Testing. Edward J. Friihauf, The Lubrizol Corp. The extent of automatic transmission fluid oxidation is compared for short term bench transmission tests with long term vehicle tests. The technique of Blotter Spot Analysis is emphasized for the comparison. Blotter Spot Analyses can help decide when an automatic transmission fluid should be changed in severe service. 790018. Chrysler's New Front Wheel Drive Automatic Transmission. Dugald Cameron and Alfred P. Blomquist, Chrysler Corp. A new three-speed automatic transmission has been designed, developed and is being produced in the U.S. by the Chrysler Corporation for its new family of front wheel drive vehicles. The transmission was designed around the Chrysler- proven TorqueFlite concept. The features of the new transmission include a "folded" construction for instal- lation in a transverse power train. The case is a one-piece aluminum die cast housing and contains the final drive and differential unit. This paper describes the design and development of this new automatic transmission. 790019. Bridging the Gap Between DEXRONMI and Type F ATF. H. E. Deen, R. O'Halloran, E. F. Outten and J. P. Szykowski, Exxon Chemical Co. An automatic transmission fluid has been developed which can meet the needs of transmissions designed for either friction modified or non-friction modified fluids. Approved under the DEXRON-II and M2C138-CJ spec- ifications, it also meets all the requirements of the M2C33-F (Type F) specification except for the friction modifier content. Since use of a friction modified fluid in Type F applications would represent a radical departure from current recommended practice, data, both pro and con, on the concept are presented. 1979 SA E Transactions 790020. Energy and Pollution vs Alternative Piston and Gas Turbine Powerplants. George J. Huebner, Jr., Environmental Research Institute of Mich- igan. The over-riding social importance of automotive fuel economy and power plant exhaust emissions is discussed in relation to proposed alternatives to the spark-ignition passenger car engine. Some engineering and use criteria for the selection of alternatives are proposed, and several alternative power plants are explored in their frame work. Three gas turbine types are discussed as alternatives, and a brief history of two-shaft turbines is presented. The influence of various automatic transmissions on passenger-car fuel economy and driveability is summa- rized. This paper concludes that automatic, continuously variable transmission functions can be achieved with a three-shaft turbine power plant with excellent fuel economy and at lower cost. 790021. Automotive Technology Projections. M. Dowdy and A. Burke, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst, of Technology, Pasadena, CA. Results of an automotive technology assessment study are presented to provide a basis of comparison for vehicles with alternative power systems. Factors considered in- clude fuel economy, exhaust emissions, multi-fuel capa- bility, advanced materials, and cost/manufacturability for both conventional and advanced alternative power sys- tems. To insure valid comparisons of vehicles with alter- native power systems, the concept of an Otto-Engine- Equivalent (OEE) vehicle is utilized. Each engine type is sized to provide equivalent vehicle performance. Fuel economy projections are made for each engine type considering both the legislated emissions standards (0.4 g/mi HC, 3.4 g/mi CO, 1.0 g/mi NOx) and possible future emissions requirements (0.4 g/mi NOx). The sensitivities of the fuel economy projections to factors such as engine torque boundary, rear axle ratio, performance criteria, 21</page><page sequence="5">790022-790029 and engine transient response are discussed. Using the OEE vehicle concept, projected fuel econ- omies of both small and full-sized vehicles with Stirling engines are up to 40 percent better than baseline vehicles with conventional engines. Vehicles with Brayton engines show up to a 30 percent better fuel economy than the baseline in full-sized vehicles, but offer little fuel economy advantage in small vehicles. Advanced continuous com- bustion power systems (Brayton and Stirling) offer advantages over the baseline vehicles in the areas of exhaust emissions and multifuel capability; however, their initial costs are projected to be substantially higher. 790022. Fuel Economy of Alternative Automotive En- gines - Learning Curves and Projections. Roy Renner, Consultant, Sonora, CA; and Harold M. Siegel, South Coast Technology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA. This paper describes a distinct approach in making technological forecasts. From historical data, fuel econ- omy learning curves have been constructed for alter- natives such as the Diesel, gas turbine, Stirling, stratified charge, and rotary engines. Assuming that evolutionary development will take place, projections of these learning curves are extended to the 1990 era. The investigation found that no engine is likely to exceed the fuel economy of the Diesel in the next 10-15 years. However, serious questions are being raised regarding the feasibility of controlling nitrogen oxides and unregulated emissions in future Diesel engines. 790023. Selecting the Optimum Engine Connecting Rod Manufacturing Process. Dale A. Maynard, Chrysler Corp. Within the past decade, manufacturing processes have undergone significant technological improvements and have supported the burden of additional imposed restric- tions. In light of these improvements and restrictions it is the intent of this paper to use automotive engine connecting rods as an example in applying an optimum manufacturing process selection algorithm for any part. Two hot forging alternatives, casting, hot formed powder metal, and precision warm forming are compared. 790026. Microalloyed Bar Products. J. H. Bucher, J. F. Butler and J. F. Held, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., Graham Lab., Pittsburgh, PA. Microalloying is the technique of adding very small amounts of certain elements to steel in order to markedly improve the mechanical properties, most notably the strength and hardness. In 1977, the VanCraft series of high strength microalloyed cold finished bars was intro- duced. In 1978, this technique has been extended to include hot rolled bars for hot forging applications. Hot forging of steel bars is the technique employed to produce many critical automotive components such as connecting rods, stabilizer bars, and many others. Typically, these parts require subsequent heat treatment to obtain the necessary properties. By microalloying with Cb or V, this heat treatment can often be eliminated since the desired properties are met in the as-forged part. This provides a significant cost savings and, of course, results in a reduction in energy consumption. The metallurgical principles involved and the prop- erties obtainable in hot rolled and cold finished bars will be described as well as selected applications. 790027. The Development of a New HSLA As-Hot-Rolled Bar Product. D. R. DiMicco, G. M. Waid, D. W. Demianczuk, D. W. Dickinson and A. T. Davenport, Republic Steel Corp., Research Center, Independence, OH. A new as-hot-rolled HSLA steel has been developed for application as round and flat bars. This material possesses a minimum yield strength of 80 ksi coupled with good bendability, weldability, and fatigue performance. This material offers design engineers and manufacturers the flexibility to upgrade from lower-strength materials to (a) increase load carrying capability of their present struc- tures or, (b) realize important weight and energy savings by going to lighter section sizes at present load ratings. It also enables them to take advantage of its high strength to replace more costly heat treated grades. 790028. Fabrication of Automotive Body Components in GrFRP. W. R. Kiefer, A. L. Mills, T. P. Bellinger and G. H. White, Vought Corp., Dallas, TX. The following paper has been prepared to describe the procedures used by the Vought Corporation to fabricate automotive body components in graphite reinforced plastic for the Ford Motor Company Graphite 1979 Ford LTD. This effort was a joint venture by the Milford Fabricating Company - a subsidiary of the Budd Com- pany - and the Vought Corporation. Graphite Fiber Reinforced Plastic, the specified material for the major body components made it neces- sary to unite proven aerospace methods with current automotive prototype technology to ensure successful completion of the project. Areas to be discussed will be the master tooling aid development, high temperature epoxy molds, and com- ponent fabrication. 790029. Fabrication and Assembly of a Graphite Fiber Reinforced Plastic Vehicle. Dennis A. Cedar, Milford Fabricating Co., Detroit, MI. The following paper has been prepared to describe the procedures used to fabricate and assemble a lightweight demonstration vehicle, built under contract to Ford Motor Company. G.F.R.P.

Major areas of emphasis include: master tooling aid development, high temperature epoxy molds, component fabrication, component sub-assembly and body assembly. These areas will be discussed in detail, along with the completion and final assembly of the lightweight vehicle. 1979 SA E Transactions 790030. Graphite-Reinforced-Plastic Passenger Car Frame. D. R. Sidwell, R. D. Torczyner and Derek Yates, Merlin Technologies, Inc.; M. B. Motwani and J. L. Thorns, Ford Motor Co. An experimental LTD chassis frame, for a 1979 Ford experimental vehicle, was designed and fabricated in graphite-reinforced plastic. Prototype composite molding techniques were employed to form the closed frame sections required for strength and stiffness. Weight savings were realized because of both com- ponent integration and material substitution; compared with its steel counterpart, the graphite frame afforded a 79 pound weight reduction while providing a 33% increase to torsional stiffness and a 16% increase in bending stiffness. The frame passed laboratory suspension and steering load tests and has been incorporated in the experimental vehicle, but not vehicle tested. 790031. Design and Fabrication of Automotive Compo- nents in Graphite Fiber-Reinforced Composites. R. E. Bonnett and H. Kulkarni, (Part I - Body- in- White) Ford Motor Co., H. Kulkarni, G. Lim and P. Beardmore, (Part II - Front End) Ford Motor Co.; and R. Knight, (Part II - Front End) Vought Corp. The design, finite element analysis and fabrication of graphite fiber reinforced plastic (GrFRP) for the body of the 1979 Ford LTD concept vehicle is described in Part I. One hundred four (104) steel body-in-white parts, weigh- ing 423 lbs., were replaced by forty-one (41) GrFRP parts, weighing 160 lbs., for a 62% reduction in weight. The floor and body side panels represent some of the largest and most complex GrFRP automotive parts produced to date. The methodology and analysis used in developing the graphite composite lay-up design of the front end for the concept vehicle is outlined in Part II. This assembly of GrFRP components weighs 30 lbs., compared with 95 lbs. for the steel counterparts, and represents a 68% weight reduction. 790036. A Strategy for Optimization of Diesel Fuel Injection System. W- G. Wessel and E.-U. Joachim, Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany). The more detailed the performance specifications for diesel engines are defined, the more difficult is the task to find the best possible compromise in applying a fuel injection system. This paper outlines in detail the strategy, how the objectives can be achieved within a reasonable time frame. The application of this strategy is demonstrated using actual results of a study based on optimization of exhaust emissions and fuel economy. 1979 SA E Transactions 790037. Response of Diesel Combustion Systems to Increase of Fuel Injection Rate. G. Greeves, Lucas CAV Ltd. (London/England). Experimental data are presented to show how diesel combustion systems respond to increase of fuel injection rate. Concepts of a fuel spray entrainment parameter, a maximum useful injection rate, and a condition termed 'impingement' are introduced to correlate and interpret widely differing responses. Best possible smoke and BSFC values in swirl type direct injection engines are obtained for injection rates 15% to 33% higher than normal values, but in practice lower rates must be used to satisfy emissions and other requirements. Engines with a high swirl rate and impingement give a superior 'retardability' for normal injection rates. Computer model calculations also show that there is a maximum useful injection rate and explain the relative fuel economies for different diesel combustion systems. 1979 SA E Transactions 790038. Two Ways to Boost a Light Duty Diesel. M. L. Monaghan, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. Light duty diesels are often criticised for their poor specific power but boosting can be used to improve the situation. An exercise was carried out in which the performance of a naturally aspirated diesel car was compared with identical vehicles fitted with turbocharged and Comprex* boosted engines. The measures necessary to apply the two boosting systems to the engines are described and the test bed performance obtained is shown for each case. Standard vehicle tests were made with each system and the performance, fuel consumption, noise and emissions results are compared. 790039. Thermodynamic Efficiency Evaluation of an In- direct Injection Diesel Engine. N. Watson and M. Kamel, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Impe- rial College of Science and Technology (London/England). The lower efficiency of the indirect-injection diesel engine, with respect to the direct injection type, is due to additional heat transfer from the combustion chamber, gas pumping between chambers, later injection timing and a different burning rate schedule. The paper describes a project to isolate and quantify these reasons for low efficiencies, using a mathematical model, supported by experimental verification. The model is based on a two-zone system (main and 23</page><page sequence="7">790040-790044 pre-chamber), with component models for heat transfer, gas flow through the passage, etc. Experimentally derived heat release schedules in main and pre-chamber are used. It is shown that for a 0 • 1 m bore engine, with a Ricardo Comet Vb pre-chamber, the different burning rate schedule is the major contribution to the difference in efficiency, with injection timing and gas pumping being the least significant. 1979 SA E Transactions 790040. Turbulent Air Flow in the Combustion Bowl of a D. I. Diesel Engine and Its Effect on Engine Performance. F. Brandl, I. Reverencie and W. Cartellieri, AVL Prof. List Ges.m.b.H. (Austria); and J. C. Dent, Loughborough Univ. of Tech- nology (England). In developing high speed swirl supported direct injection diesel engines it has been a general experience that different engine results (performance, smoke and emis- sion) may be obtained when using different intake port designs, although the swirl numbers (stationary flow test rig) of the different ports were identical. Therefore, an in-cylinder flow investigation under motoring conditions using hot wire anemometry was performed for three different inlet port designs having the same swirl number. Special emphasis was drawn on the engine design parameters being as close as possible to reality. Thus, the flow investigation and the engine tests were carried out at a typical compression ratio of 18 : 1 using a standard combustion bowl in the piston as well as produceable inlet ports. All flow measurements were carried out under motoring conditions covering the speed range from 1100 to 2400 rpm. By use of probes located on the piston a two-dimensional flow field including turbulence param- eters could be established throughout the whole cycle. In-parallel engine tests were carried out with the ports in question in order to obtain performance, smoke and gaseous emissions data with these ports. Hence, engine test data could be linked with in-cylinder flow data. As a result certain air motion characteristics within the bowl were found to be essential for the magnitude of smoke in the exhaust and for the efficiency of combustion (fuel economy). 1979 SA E Transactions 790041. Continuously Variable Transmissions for Cars with High Ratio Coverage. P. Baudoin, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault (France). Starting from a classification of car transmissions and from the manufacturers requirements, especially for fuel savings, the potential advantages of continuously variable transmissions permitting to associate low engine RPM with high vehicle speed, are shown. The control of the engine, transmission and clutch to reach a given optimum, is explained. Here are given results of simulation or testing of vehicles equipped with a Renault hydrostatic prototype transmission, a 2-mode hydromechanical transmission and a Van Doorne prototype Transmatic. Highway fuel economy trends are quantified in case of substitution of the conventional S.I. engine for Diesel and/or turbocharged engines. 790042. Purely Hydrostatic High Ratio Transmission. R. Maistrelli, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault (France). A continuously variable transmission with an overall ratio of 6 may be worked out on a purely hydrostatic basis. High power to weight ratio hydraulic pump and motors can be designed to avoid bulk and weight penalty. Mass production can be used. Materials and manufac- turing processes are not more sophisticated than in conventional automobile manufacturing. Although lower than in gear transmission, efficiency of the hydrostatic transmission is suitable for automobile use. 1979 SA E Transactions 790043. A Fundamental Consideration of Shift Mecha- nism of Automatic Transmission. Yoshio Shindo and Hiroshi Ito, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Ja- pan); and Tomo-o Ishihara, Univ. of Tokyo (Japan). A new shift mechanism for automatic transmissions was designed by considering a compact design and a better shift quality, which used exclusively plate clutches as the engaging elements of the planetary reaction members. The new shift mechanism is useful for three- or four-speed automatic transmissions. In this design, a shift control method for the new mechanism and the effect of the vibration system of vehicle on the shift quality were investigated both theoretically and experimentally. As results of the study, it was clarified that the new shift mechanism shows a better shift quality, and that the shift characteristics are remarkably affected by the vibration system of vehicle, especially the torsional vibration of rear axles, the axle wind-up and the fore-and-aft vibration of engine. The new shift mechanism has been successfully applied to a Toyota four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. 1979 SA E Transactions 790044. A Digital Electronic Shift Schedule Control for Vehicular Automatic Transmissions. G. L. Casey, Bendix Corp. A digital transmission shift schedule control has been developed which measures throttle position and vehicle speed to determine the proper gear ratio based on preprogrammed upshift and downshift schedules. Transmission pleasability was evaluated for various degrees of resolution for these two primary input varia- bles. Five- and six-bit vehicle speed and three- and four-bit throttle position resolutions were tested. Throttle 24</page><page sequence="8">790045-790050 position was measured with an experimental variable reluctance (variable frequency oscillator) device, located above the throttle pedal; vehicle speed was measured by a magnetic pickup from a toothed wheel on the transmission output shaft. The electronic control system has been evaluated for over 4000 miles under city, highway, sea level and high altitude conditions. 790045. Powertrain Matching for Better Fuel Economy. Lawrence T. Wong and William J. Clemens, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses current powertrain matching meth- odology and its applications. Modular computer pro- grams, which model each component of the vehicle/ powertrain system, simulate the vehicle over specified driving cycles to project fuel economy and performance. Fuel economy opportunities due to better powertrain matching are discussed, including optimum engine sizing, torque converter matching, transmission gear ratio spac- ing and shift scheduling, axle ratio and vehicle weight effect. An emission projection technique utilizing time weighted engine speed/load points generated either by experiment or by analytical models is used to quantify fuel economy/emissions trade-offs. 790046. Review of the Automotive Torque Converter. Robert A. Mercure, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Div. of Transportation Energy Conservation. With the big gains in automobile fuel economy already accomplished, primarily with off-shelf technology, further improvements above that expected by further downsizing will now require advanced technology. One area in which advancing the state of the art may not only benefit fuel economy but preserve driveability is in the fluid dynamic performance of torque converters. While lockup clutches may preclude the need for higher converter efficiency, improved performance in the primary gears where lockup is inhibited would still benefit fuel economy. The gains, however, would be less, but driveability would be improved by the higher coupling efficiency. Detailed fluid dynamic investigations were performed on a three-element torque converter. These investigations were based on computer solutions that have been successfully applied in the design of gas turbines. Using a numerical solution, surface velocities were computed along the reactor blade based on a two-dimensional flow field. These velocities were computed for an existing reactor blade and a proposed blade with a shortened axial chord. The reduced chord was intended for a more compact converter circuit design. Diffusion factors and exit fluid angles of the short chord design were maintained within the limits of the existing long chord design. Based on an approximation to the three-dimensional flow field, a computer program for the design of centrifugal impellers was modified for application to impellers with axial flow discharge such as used in converter circuits. The results indicated the presence of negative and highly non-uniform velocities in the impeller. If these negative velocities or backflows could be removed and more uniform velocity gradients could be maintained, higher efficiency should be expected. Recommendations are made for further investigations. 790047. Design and Development of a Single Rail Shift Overdrive (SROD) Manual Transmission. William D. Campbell and Richard A. Petts, Ford Motor Co. The Single Rail Shift Overdrive (SROD) 4-speed manual transmission was designed and developed to incorporate the reliability and durability characteristics of a totally enclosed, non-adjusting, single-rail shift mechanism while maintaining the conventional 4-speed shift pattern. An additional objective was to optimize fuel economy with 3.3L, 4.1L and 5.0L engines while maintaining acceptable vehicle performance, acceleration and vehicle driveline noise, vibration and harshness. The design procedures used to obtain the design objective and to satisfy performance requirements are reviewed. 790048. New 7.5- and 8.5-Inch Ford Axles for 1979. Denis J. Manduzzi and Paul E. Bak, Powertrain and Chassis Product Engrg., Ford Motor Co. New fuel efficient 7.5" (190.5 mm) and 8.5" (215.9 mm) cast center axles have been introduced in the 1979 Ford and Mercury fullsize cars. The design, development and manufacturing of these axles contain several new and interesting features which offer maximum manufacturing flexibility and improved reliability. 790049. Evaluation of the Flywheel Drive Concept for Passenger Vehicles. Andrew A. Frank and Norman H. Beachley, Univ. of Wisconsin- Madison. A flywheel to manage energy between a prime mover and a load has been used in many engineering applications. Automotive applications, however, pose a number of difficult problems which can be overcome only with proper design. Substantial mileage and performance improvements while meeting emission constraints can then be accomplished with the concept. An experimental flywheel car has been designed and built at the University of Wisconsin that has demonstrated a mileage improvement of about 50% over a correspond- ing production vehicle on the EPA/FUDC. With con- tinued research and development gains of 100% appear feasible. 1979 SA E Transactions 790050. An Objective Measure of the Readability of Electronic Display - Optical Filter Combinations. Derrick M. Kuzak and Mark S. Guimond, Engineering &amp; Research Office, Chrysler Corp. The ambient light levels incident on electronic displays 25</page><page sequence="9">790052-790061 located in the instrument panel can be sufficiently bright to impair their readability, unless optical filtering tech- niques are employed. The aim of this study was to develop the experimental procedures and associated instrumen- tation to objectively and quantitatively measure the readability of a given electronic display - optical filter combination. Readability was quantified through the two criteria of recognition accuracy and response time. The effects of display parameters such as character size, luminance, and background color on the accuracy and response time data, and subsequent filter choice, were evaluated. 1979 SA E Transactions 790052. Liquid Crystal Display for the Automobile. Brian Dellande, Automotive Systems Engrg., Motorola, Inc., Mesa, A Z. The advances being made in the liquid crystal technology are now enabling the liquid crystal display (LCD) to be used in the hostile environment of the automobile. The liquid crystal technology advances, combined with their known qualities, aesthetics, and ever-increasing potential, make them a candidate for the display technology of the near future. This paper reviews the current "state- of-the-art" of LCD's and discusses how electronics may be used to solve many of the practical problems of integrating LCD's into instrumentation systems.

This paper discusses factors to be considered in the planning of automotive electronic instrumentation prod- ucts with references to related marketing study results. The following factors are considered: existence of a market, product variable cost, investment, reliability, human factors, and regulatory requirements. Recent automotive electronic instrumentation product offerings in the U.S. and Europe are enumerated. 790057. Electronic Instrumentation - Luminous Displays and Their Drive Circuits. B. Shepherd, Vehicle Instrumentation Div., Smiths Industries Ltd. (London/England). This paper reviews active work being carried out in Europe. A newly developed range of I.C.'s is described. Test panels using Vacuum Fluorescence, DC Electro- luminescence, and Light Emitting Diodes are being built into display modules and fitted to vehicles for evaluation. The present state of development with DC Electro- luminescence is described, including combined instrument panels which can be made now.

Richard DuBois, Wagner Elec- tric Corp. Vacuum fluorescent displays offer the instrument engineer 26</page><page sequence="10">790063-790068 a wide range of design options. Close liason between the instrument engineer and the display engineer is an important part of the design cycle. Various specification proposals are made and a new design proposal is introduced. 790063. (SP-442) Turbochargers for the 1980s-Current Trends and Future Prospects. N. Watson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Imperial College of Science and Technology (London/England). Due to the combined effects of economic pressure, fuel consumption and emissions goals, turbochargers are now used on gasoline and diesel engines covering the power range from around 100 to 50,000 hp. The requirements placed on turbocharging systems in the very different applications of automobiles (gasoline and diesel), trucks and off-highway vehicles are reviewed. The developments that will be required in the 1980's are highlighted, together with an analysis of current limi- tations and future potential. These developments relate not just to turbomachinery, but to matching, system design and maximizing exhaust gas energy utilization. 1979 SA E Transactions 790064. (SP-442) Variable Area Turbocharger for High Output Diesel Engines. S. G. Berenyi, Teledyne Continental Motors, General Products Div., Muskegon, MI; and C. J. Raffa, Propulsion Systems Div., USATARADCOM, Warren, MI. High output turbocharged diesel engines require efficient air delivery systems with high pressure ratio, broad range and surge-free compressors of very high efficiency. Similarly, high efficiency turbines with) variable stators will be needed to maintain high turbine speed at times when engine speed and airflow are low. The turbocharger that evolved in a U.S. Army TARADCOM sponsored program to meet these goals has a backward curved centrifugal compressor with a wedge type moveable vane diffuser for surge control and a radial inflow turbine with individually pivoted nozzle vanes for inlet flow area control. After several design iterations and bench tests, extensive engine tests were conducted to demonstrate the substantial improvements in diesel engine performance that are attainable with these turbochargers. 1979 SA E Transactions 790065. (SP-442) The Effect of Compressor and Turbine Specific Speed on Turbocharger Efficiency and Engine Performance. Wilbur Allen Spraker, Jr. and Cheng-Chien Chou, Schwitzer, Wallace Murray Corp., Indianapolis, IN. As a result of dimensional and cost limitations, the specific speed of today's turbochargers for vehicular diesel engine applications are higher than optimum. Perform- ance of turbochargers therefore falls below the state- of-the-art. According to the analysis presented in this paper, one avenue for improvement of turbocharger overall efficiency is reduction of compressor and turbine specific speed. A technique for optimizing turbocharger overall perform- ance is presented, based on variation of component specific speed. It is concluded that the concept of lower specific speed turbochargers deserves further study. It is essential that the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of this concept be carefully evaluated by turbocharger and diesel engine manufacturers. 790066. (SP-442) Centrifugal Compressor Development fot a Variable Area Turbocharger. James L. Harp, Thermo Mechanical Systems Co., Canoga Park, CA; and Thomas P. Oatway, Lockheed California Co., Burbank, CA. A variable geometry diffuser was developed for a centrifugal compressor with the objective of meeting the surge regulation and air flow requirement of the Army's Variable Area Turbocharger Program. Two types of compressor rotors were built and tested: a radial-bladed impeller design and a backswept impeller. Results of the performance test program indicated that the variable geometry compressor met the range and efficiency goals over most of the required operating conditions. The backswept impeller was found to be superior to the radial-bladed impeller over the entire operating map. Compressor efficiencies as high as 80% were demonstrated in the high airflow operating regime (rated engine speed). At very low airflows corresponding to the lowest engine speed operation, the onset of impeller stalling caused an efficiency loss. It is believed that the complexity of variable geometry is justified where max- imum efficiency and range is mandatory. 790067. (SP-442) Series T urbocharging-A Requirement for High Specific Output, Vehicular Diesel Engines. Keith G. Rochford, AiResearch Indus- trial Div., The Garrett Corp. In view of the problems associated with obtaining broad compressor range and efficiency at high pressure ratio and the ever-present requirements for durable, low cost and low inertia turbochargers, it is logical to examine the performance benefits to be derived from series turbo- charging. The merits and demerits of series turbocharging are reviewed. With respect to efficiency, range, transient response, and pressure ratio capability, it is practical to use currently available vehicular turbocharger technology to provide optimum solutions for near term, higher pressure ratio turbocharger capability. 790068. (SP-442) Estimating the Influence of Pulsating Flow Conditions on the Performance of a Tur- bine. S. S. Shamsi, Pakistan State Oil Co., Ltd. (Karachi/Pakistan). 27</page><page sequence="11">790069-790075 Performance of both radial and axial turbines under non-steady flow conditions is of considerable interest to the mechanical engineer. In this paper a new method of estimating turbine performance under such conditions, based on the authors idea of 'mean effective turbine expansion ratio' (m.e.t.e.r) has been described and a digital computer programme to evaluate the 'pulse factor' presented. The method has been successfully used by the author in real-time digital, hybrid and analog computer simulations for the prediction of transient performance of a turbocharged diesel engine. Good agreement was achieved between the predicted and test-bed results. 790069. (SP-442) Helmholtz Tuned Induction System for Turbocharged Diesel Engine. M. C. Brands, Cummins Engine Co. A tuned intake induction system using a Helmholtz resonator was applied to an in-line six cylinder, four cycle heavy duty diesel engine. The system adopted was designed to maximize the engine breathing performance at the peak torque engine speed. Significant advantages noted were improvements in volumetric efficiency by 12 percent, improved cylinder-to-cylinder air distribution and faster turbocharger response. The increased trapped air-fuel ratio also results in improved combustion effi- ciency and reduction of smoke emissions. Additional improvements appeared feasible by compressor redesign and optimization of valve timing. The primary disad- vantage was the space claim the system required; however, compact designs can be achieved without great difficulty. 1979 SA E Transactions 790072. A New Concept in Child Restraint Design. Thomas G. Moinar and Don M. Rodwell, Cooldrive Consolidated Industries, Div. of Repco Ltd. (Melbourne/Australia). A reduction in death and injury rates of child vehicle occupants is being experienced in Australia by a unique child restraint device which is compatible with all motor vehicles. Basic parameters, product development and extensive dynamic sled test programs are explained. Concluding with the achieved benefits which include excellent crash performance, simplicity, versatility and public acceptance of a totally new concept. 790073. Dynamic Sled Testing of Child Restraints. Barbara J. Kelleher and Michael J. Walsh, Calspan Corp., Advanced Technology Center. Child restraint performance in frontal and lateral crash simulations is presented and discussed based upon tests conducted on the Calspan HYGE acceleration sled. Differing acceleration pulses for frontal tests were used to evaluate the pulse shape effect upon the child restraint systems. Two types of three-year-old size anthropometric test devices (ATDs) were used and restraint systems were intentionally improperly installed in an effort to ascertain the potential hazard to the child occupant from improper installation. Data obtained include head excursion, head and chest triaxial accelerations, Head Severity Index (HSI) and Chest Severity Index (CSI) values for the ATDs. High speed movie coverage produced dummy kinematic results. From the results of this study comparisons are made between the effects of different pulse shapes, the effects of different ATDs on restraint performance and the dynamic performance of the ATD/restraint complex under both proper and improper system installation. FMVSS 213 and Canadian P.C. 1974-1013 dynamic performance criteria are discussed in light of the findings of this study. 790074. Impact Sled Test Evaluation of Restraint Systems Used in Transportation of Handicapped Children. Lawrence W. Schneider and John W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan; and C. Ernest Cooney, Div. for Handicapped Children, Department of Public Instruction, State of Wisconsin. A series of 16 sled impact tests was conducted at the Highway Safety Research Institute sled facility to evaluate the effectiveness of restraint devices and systems currently being used to transport school-bus and wheelchair-seated handicapped children. A sled impact pulse of 20 m.p.h. and 16 G's was used for all tests. Eight tests involved wheelchairs in forward-facing and side-facing orientations for head-on and 33-degree oblique impacts. Another eight tests involved forward-facing bus seats for head-on and 33-degree oblique impacts. The results generally point out the ineffectiveness of many currently used devices and systems for protecting the child in a bus collision. In six of the eight bus seat tests the dummy's head struck the back of the bus seat in front. This was primarily because of a lack of uppertorso restraint. A padded belt commonly used for restraining children in wheelchairs is also inadequate by itself and should only be used with additional thorax and pelvic restraint. The practice of placing wheelchairs in a side-facing orientation was found to be a poor one for the protection of the child. 790075. The Effects of Radio and Press Publicity on the Safe Carriage of Children in Cars. C. J. Boughton and I. R. Johnston, Office of Road Safety, Department of Transport (Australia). In April 1978 the Office of Road Safety conducted a press and radio publicity campaign aimed at increasing the fitting and use, by children, of conventional belts where child-restraints are not available and relocating children, particularly those unrestrained, from front to rear seats. Undertaken in States with and without child restraint legislation, the publicity campaign was evaluated using data from roadside observations of restraint fitting and use. 28</page><page sequence="12">790076-790082 The campaign was not effective in achieving the desired behavioural changes. However, the results pro- vided valuable data on the carriage of children in cars and highlighted the differences between States with or without child restraint legislation. 790076. Evaluation of Lubricants for Japanese Small Air-Cooled Two-Cycle Engines. T. Maeda, T. Tanabe, Y. Maeda and K. Tamura, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd. Problems associated with use of oils for small air-cooled two-cycle engines are mainly piston deposits, ring sticking, spark plug fouling, combustion-chamber deposits, piston seizure, exhaust system blocking and visible smoke. This paper describes some test methods for evaluation of lubricants for Japanese small air-cooled two-cycle engines. Results obtained from some of these tests are also expressed. The effect of base oil composition and additive type on lubricant performance is also described. 790078. Performance Test Methods for Two-Stroke Cycle Engine Lubricants Including Lean Fuel-Oil Ratio Conditions. C. G. A. Eberan-Eberhorst, Deutsche BP Aktiengesellschaft (Hamburg/ West Germany); and H. Martin, Société Fran- çaise des Pétroles BP (Paris/France). Development of 2-stroke cycle gasoline engines towards higher specific outputs and environmental aspects have resulted in more stringent lubricating oil requirements. A classification system is being generated by SAE/ASTM/API in cooperation with CEC to facilitate selection of suitable oils with different performance levels depending on their application. Standardized CEC Test Methods and European in-house tests used for 2-stroke oil development are described and discussed. Special oils for use at lean fuel : oil ratios and biodegradeable lubricants have been developed. Typical bench and field test results obtained with modern formulation concepts and reference oils are presented. 790079. Future Two-Cycle Engine Oil Development - A New Challenge. C. R. McCaffree and R. M. Jacobsen, Chevron Chemical Company, Oronite Additives. Today's two-cycle engine oils are not expected to adequately meet future engine oil requirements. It is recommended that oil developers use a Comprehensive Oil Development Plan for future oils. A Plan should include five key elements: Engine Manufacturer Contact, Mechanism Studies and Failures Analysis, Oil Formu- lating, Laboratory Engine Evaluation, and Field Evalu- ation. These elements are described through examples of lubrication and deposit programs. The most important future oil performance requirement is considered to be scuffing control. Data from the Gl 5 laboratory engine scuff test are presented which should assist in the development of future oils. The importance of Mechanism Studies and Failure Analysis programs to support for- mulation for antiscuffing is stressed. A review of pub- lished air-cooled engine deposit test procedures has shown the lack of world-wide standardization. Satisfactory water-cooled engine test procedures are available al- though the standardized BIA-TCW test needs modern- ization. In general, studies of laboratory engine test procedures show a need for better correlation with field evaluations - the ultimate proving ground for future oils. 1979 SA E Transactions 790080. Performance Evaluation of a Versatile Two-Cycle Lubricant Additive. D. L. Clason and W. M. Nahumck, Research Department, The Lubrizol Corporation. Boating Industry Associations (BIA) TC-W certified two-cycle engine oils are used in a variety of both air- and water-cooled engines. Some high performance two-cycle engines used in the motorcycle and snowmobile market have shown performance deficiencies with current TC-W quality lubricants. This paper traces the development of an additive capable of meeting the demands of severe air-cooled engine tests as well as the current TC-W lubricant specification for water-cooled engines. Tests developed to evaluate lubricant performance in both air- and water-cooled engines are described. The need for standardized test procedures in addition to the BIA TC-W specification is shown. 790081. Emission Facility Design Criteria. L. G. Feiler III, C. E. Wing, J. N. Danzo and T. N. Louckes, Oldsmobile Div., G.M.C., Lansing, MI. Early in the 1970's, Oldsmobile recognized the need to construct a new accurate, reliable, and versatile emission test facility to accommodate the more stringent Federal and State emission standards. This paper reviews in detail: layout of the test facility, its measurement capabilities, computer data handling, storage and retrieval processes, and a special data reduction program capable of producing two or three dimensional plots of dynamic engine emission parameters. The final section reviews the facility's physical design, data acquisition capability, and computer versatility which will permit updating in the future to accommodate changes in this very fast moving field of emission measurement technology. 1979 SA E Transactions 790082. An Emission Test Facility for Measuring Cata- lytic Converter Efficiencies. Norman W. Laursen, Instrumentation Dept., General Mo- tors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Sixteen gas analyzers are used to measure emissions into and out of the catalytic converters while conducting 29</page><page sequence="13">790084-790092 Environmental Protection Agency vehicle test procedures. A computer system controls the analyzer consoles, logs test data, and provides test results quickly. The computer logs data during testing, then on command transmits it to the GM Research Laboratories (GMR) Data Center. Data reduction is done at the GMR Data Center because it has a large computer to do the calculations and programmers to maintain the reduction programs. The test summary can be transmitted back to the test site. The system was tested extensively to verify accuracy of results. Gas analyzers were calibrated, data logging and handling were checked, and the data reduction programs were scrutinized. The system has given consistent results during its operation. 790084.

Shadday, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. Engine tests were conducted to determine the effects of various full flow and by-pass lube oil filter combinations on diesel engine wear. The filter performance was determined by measuring the wear of piston rings, main and rod bearings in a Cummins NTC-335, after contam- inating the lube system with a known amount of AC Fine Dust to accelerate wear. The results of these tests prove: 1. It is possible to dramatically reduce the size of the by-pass filter through the use of stacked discs filter technology. 2. No sacrifice of engine protection or filter life is necessary. 3. By-pass filters extend engine life through improved filtration and reduced wear providing the lowest total cost to the engine user. 790090. Automotive Lube Oil Filters for Extended Serv- ice at High Crankcase Oil Temperatures. Theodore C. Sauer and Richard F. McGillick, Purolator Filter Div., Purolator, Inc. Passenger car engine lube oil filter advancements have been made to improve filter reliability. The design consists of a dual media laminate for greater dirt holding capacity and improved resistance to higher crankcase oil temper- atures. Field testing has shown service life to be at least 15,000 miles with potential for longer service. 790091. The Parameters That Control the Performance of the In-Tank Fuel Strainer. Carl E. Miller, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. Gasoline delivery-filtration systems presently used in vehicles are highly effective. Nevertheless, there is a continual evolution of the system as vehicles with improved emission profiles and fuel economy are manu- factured and alternate automotive combustion fuels are being adopted. Therefore, an investigation of the fun- damental parameters controlling delivery of filtered fuel to the engine is important to the engineers responsible for new designs. In this paper the basic engineering factors required to understand how in-tank fuel strainers function are discussed. Guidance in choosing fabrics that ensure optimum performance for various types of liquid fuels is also provided. 1979 SA E Transactions 790092. Application of Laser Diagnostics to an Injected Engine.

Measurements taken in a special, single cylinder, direct injection stratified-charge engine are presented. The optical measurement techniques employed include con- tinuous-wave laser Raman spectroscopy for fuel and air concentrations, pulsed laser Raman spectroscopy for density fluctuations, high-speed cinematography for flow visualization, and laser Doppler velocimetry for velocities and turbulence intensities. More conventional data on cylinder pressure, power, and emissions levels are also given. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the types of detailed measurements that are now possible within an engine cylinder. 1979 SA E Transactions 30</page><page sequence="14">790093-790106 790093. A Pulsed-Illumination, Closed-Circuit Television System for Real-Time Viewing of Engine Com- bustion and Observed Cyclic Variations. R. L. Steinberger, W. W. Marden and F. V. Bracco, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ. A closed-circuit television technique has been developed for the real time viewing and recording of combustion and related processes in internal combustion engines. The technique has been applied to a transparent piston, transparent head engine, and shadographs of combustion chamber events have been observed and recorded. The technique is particularly suited for the study of changes in the combustion process due to variations of engine parameters such as mixture ratio, load, speed, spark timing, injection initiation, etc., since the changes can be observed and recorded at the same time that they occur. A brief and qualitative study of flame and pressure cyclic variations is reported and discussed as an example of an application for which the television technique is partic- ularly suited. 790094. Laser Doppler Anemometer Measurements in an Internal Combustion Engine. Rodney B. Rask, Fluid Dynamics Research Dept., General Mo- tors Research Labs., Warren, MI. This research demonstrates the capability of the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) for making measurements inside a piston-engine cylinder. The backscatter mode of LDA operation, requiring only a single window in the cylinder, was used. An ensemble-average data-processing technique has been developed to analyze the raw veloc- ity-crankangle data. Single-component measurements of mean velocity and rms velocity fluctuation at a single point are presented as functions of crankangle for three engine speeds. A comparison of motored and fired results is shown for one engine speed. Measurements of two components of velocity at several locations show the basic vortical nature of the flow field in this particular engine. 1979 SA E Transactions 790095. Flow Visualization Study of the Intake Process of an Internal Combustion Engine. A. Ekchian and D. P. Hoult, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. The efficiency of combustion and the production of pollutants in the internal combustion engine are strongly dependent on the turbulent flow field in the engine cylinder. In most engines, turbulence is almost exclusively generated during the induction stroke. A water analog was used to visualize and study this process for a simple geometry cylinder. The flow field, during the induction process, was observed to be structured and highly repeatable from cycle to cycle. The structure was comprised of two ring vortices, of concentrated vorticity, which were of the same scale as the engine cylinder. A detailed study of the characteristics of the vortex rings was carried out for the case of an axisymmetric cylinder geometry. Inviscid scaling laws were obtained from these results that describe the development and stability of the structured flow field. 1979 SA E Transactions 790096. Gas Velocity Measurements of a Motored and Firing Engine by Laser Anemometry. T. Asanuma, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Tokai Univ.; and T. Obokata, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Gunma Univ. The Laser Doppler Anemometer, a new instrument capable of making non-interfering gas velocity meas- urements, hás been used to investigate the gas behavior in the cylinder of a firing engine. First of all, the necessary conditions for a real-time measurement of the gas velocity by the LDA are examined, and thereby two typical flows, squish and torch, in the cylinder of an engine with both motoring and firing have been measured. As a result, the optical technique is ascertained to be a promising one for application to research on a firing engine. 1979 SA E Transactions 790103. Using Microwaves to Phase Cylinder Pressure to Crankshaft Position. John H. Lienesch and Mark K. Krage, General Motors Research Labs. High-speed digital recording of cylinder pressure data at the General Motors Research Laboratories is common- place. Improvements in transducers and data acquisition techniques over the years have allowed increasing con- fidence to be placed in the magnitudes of these recorded data. Current techniques for determining the correct phasing of these data with respect to crank angle, however, have not kept pace. A new phasing technique is described which involves transmission of microwave energy through the spark plug hole and into the cylinder of a motored engine. At certain piston positions, symmetric about minimum volume, microwave resonances occur. These resonances are recorded on an oscilloscope screen along with the one-degree pulses generated by the crankshaft. Analysis of these recorded data yields pressure-crank angle phasing information accurate to the order of ± 0.1 °CA for open-chamber engines. Two production open-chamber gasoline engines and one divided-chamber diesel engine were tested using this technique. A short computer program is given which aids the user in performing the required calculations to determine the pressure-crank angle phasing for a particular set of microwave data. 1979 SA E Transactions 790106. A Development of the Traction Roller System for a Gas Turbine Driven APU. Kenya Nakamura, Akira Sato and Hiroshi Okano, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and Tatsuro Sasaki, NACHI- Fujikoshi Corp. 31</page><page sequence="15">790107-790111 A new type of speed reduction device has been developed to drive an auxiliary power unit by small gas turbine engine with the speed up to 86,000 rpm. The device adopts a traction drive system with planetary roller arrangement. In the traction drive system, power is transmitted by the tractive force generated between the rolling elements. The device has the potential to be superior in efficiency together with lower noise level over conventional gear system specially in high rotating speed range. A loss estimation study indicated that the sliding friction loss of the supporting carrier is the dominant one in this system. Therefore, the better efficiency will be attainable by improving the carrier configuration. It is understood from the study that excess oil supply into the race ways causes considerable drop of torque capacity together with the increased churning loss in the traction system. 790107. Air Bearing Development for a GM Automotive Gas Turbine. Richard J. Trippett, Power Systems Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Elimination of oil from the hot section of the engine, very low running losses and potential cost reductions are incentives to develop air bearings for the high speed rotors of automotive gas turbines. Low air bearing stiffness, start-stop wear and high starting torque are design challenges in this application. This paper outlines analytical and experimental programs undertaken by the Power Systems Department of the General Motors Research Laboratories to evaluate air bearing usage in vehicular gas turbines. Air bearing operation has been demonstrated in engine dynamometer tests. A better understanding of the many factors which affect the performance of cantilevered-leaf air bearings has been realized through extensive rotor dynamics rig testing coupled with development of bearing analysis computer programs. Measured running losses of the air bearing are much lower than those of the oil jet lubricated ball bearing it is replacing. Increasing leaf thickness, leaf-housing attachment angle, leaf free radius and eliminating the clearance between the leaf beam and housing slot increased the bearing stiffness. 790108. Ceramics in Rolling Element Bearings. Charles F. Bersch and Philip Weinberg, Naval Air Systems Command, Washington, DC. The feasibility of using hot pressed silicon nitride (HPSN) for rolling elements and for races in ball bearings and roller bearings has been explored. HPSN offers oppor- tunities to alleviate many current bearing problems including DN and fatigue life limitations, lubricant and cooling system deficiencies and extreme environment demands. The history of ceramic bearings and the results of various element tests, bearing tests in rigs and bearing tests in a turbine engine will be reviewed. The advantages and problems associated with the use of HPSN in rolling element bearings will be discussed. 790109. Foil Type Bearings for the Chrysler Automotive Gas Turbine Engine Program - Development and Operational Experiences. Stanley Gray, Me- chanical Technology Inc. The developmental and operational experience with a foil air bearing in the 58,500 rpm gas generator of the Chrysler Upgraded automotive gas turbine is presented. Simulator work encompassed mating the 500° F air foil with oil-lubricated foil bearings, which then evolved into the final air bearing - rigid oil bearing engine system. Over two years of testing in engines and cars has shown the foil air bearing to have the performance requirements. Work on foil material and coating life problems is discussed. The potential of the bearing to meet the 1200° F and low power loss needs of future engines and current technology support work is presented. 790110. EPRI/TVA Pilot Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program. Ralph J. Ferraro, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); and David L. Harbaugh, Southern California Edison Co. (SCE). The emerging national effort to commercialize electric vehicles (EVs) has significant potential for impact on utility load curves and distribution feeder systems. With the implementation of national energy goals, utilities recognize the need to identify the interactions between large-scale use of EVs and utility operations. Since utilities will have to provide the needed energy and "live with the impact," it is appropriate and desirable that utilities participate actively in the national effort to accelerate evaluation and introduction of EVs. This paper discusses the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)/Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) demonstration program, describing the initial testing and evaluation of non-prototype EVs in a real- world envi- ronment, the demonstration design, and finally the data acquisition and reporting plans. 790111. The London Electric Delivery Van Assessment Scheme. G. W. Wicken, Vehicles Div., Dept. of Industry (United Kingdom). The performance, reliability and maintenance and run- ning costs of 62 battery electric delivery vans, supplied by three manufacturers, in daily use in the Greater London area are being assessed over a three year period in comparison with closely equivalent conventional vehicles on similar duties. The primary purpose is to obtain independent operational experience covering a wide variety of suitable applications over an extended period and provide reliable factual information about the performance of the vehicles in normal daily use with typical loads and drivers. Information of value to operators, the industry and Government will be produced. 32</page><page sequence="16">790113-790119 790113. ENEL Experience and Demonstration Programs in the Field of Electric Vehicles. A. Bossi, P. Menga, L. Paris and M. Sforzini, ENEL (Italy). ENEL, the Italian Electricity Board, has launched extensive programs of research, development and dem- onstration in the field of battery-powered vehicles, as the widespread use of electric vehicles should have a positive effect on the energy picture and the environment. Moreover, overnight battery recharging would contribute to the levelling of the electrical load-profile. Possible near-term applications of electric vehicles have already been pinpointed within the framework of the activities of ENEL and other important Italian utilities. Electric vans have been or are being developed in co-operation with Italian manufacturers. More than 50 electric vehicles of different types have been already assigned to ENEL operational units for demonstration purposes. Laboratory and on-the-road tests are planned to improve the vehicle and battery performance. 790115. Cold Temperature Tests of Heated/Insulated Battery for AM General DJ-5E Jeeps. Lewis J. Gerlach, Research and Development Labs., U.S. Postal Service. The U.S. Postal Service operates approximately 400 electric vehicles; predominantly AM General DJ-5E vehicles with a 1300-pound (590 kilogram), 3.22 cubic foot (9 X 10"2 cubic meter), 54- volt Gould propulsion battery. A number of the vehicles were assigned to delivery routes in low ambient temperatures which affected battery performance. The field installation of foil-faced insulation on inservice batteries maintained a 15°F (-9.5°C) to 18°F (-7.75 °C) higher electrolyte temperature than unwrapped batteries exposed to 15°F (-9.5°C) ambient temperatures. Overnight "cold-soak" in 15°F (-9.5°C) ambient tem- perature did not significantly reduce battery capacity because of the heat retained after completion of the charging cycle. Weekend "cold-soak" in 15°F (-9.5 °C) ambient temperature, however, reduced battery capacity such that the vehicles could not complete assigned routes. The purpose of this effort was to determine practical solutions for maintaining the battery in an operable condition, i.e., electrolyte temperature above 50°F (10°C), over weekend "cold-soak" periods in ambient tempera- tures as low as 15°F (-9.5°C). Cold chamber tests were conducted on both the unwrapped battery and on the battery with a combination of various types of heat sources and insulation. Test results indicated that a heat source of about 300 watts with a foil-faced insulation cover and heat cycling by thermostatic control would maintain the battery in an operable condition. As a result of this effort, the vehicles will now be able to complete assigned routes in these low ambient temperatures after weekend "cold-soak" periods. 790116. Transient Versus Steady-State Tire Rolling Loss Testing. Dieter J. Schuring, Central Research Labs., The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. A formula is developed for computing the energy loss per unit distance (or the "rolling loss") of tires operating under transient conditions. The formula is applied to two transient test schedules - a warm-up test with constant speed and zero torque (free-rolling), and an urban driving test with rapidly varying speeds and braking/driving torques. Test results indicate that the average rolling loss during warm-up is 9%, and during urban driving, 26 to 47% higher than the steady-state rolling loss. Equipment problems associated with transient testing are indicated. 1979 SA E Transactions 790117. Inter-Test Facility Rolling Resistance Correlation Via Control Tire Concept and Computer Multiple Regression Modeling. D. E. Tillinger, J. R. Weber and R. H. Strowe, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Experimental or observed rolling resistance data can be utilized to develop an empirical model that accurately depicts tire rolling resistance as a function of load and pressure over a wide range of load and pressure variations. This method allows the development of a graphical expression (carpet plot) or mathematical expression (computer modeled) to depict rolling resistance on three "control tires." When the graphical or computer modeled systems are combined with a basic control tire correlation concept, a rather accurate inter-test facility prediction system does not have to rely on the sometimes inaccurate correction equations developed from theoretical modeling techniques, 790118. A Mathematical Technique for Predicting Equi- librium Rolling Resistance of Tires from Short Duration Tests. C. Brown and I. Gusakov, Calspan Corp., Advanced Technology Center, Buffalo, NY. A technique using an exponential least squares fit to analyze the behavior of measured nonsteady-state rolling resistance data and to compute the equilibrium rolling resistance force is discussed. Raw data are filtered analytically to reduce amplitude fluctuations prior to applying the technique. The method has been applied to rolling resistance tests conducted at the Calspan Tire Research Facility on tires in a free-rolling straight-ahead condition, under constant velocity and load. The use of the prediction technique is demonstrated for 12 passenger car tires that were tested under equilibrium conditions. 790119. HELENOID Actuators - A New Concept in Extremely Fast Acting Solenoids. A. H. Seilly, Lucas Industries Ltd. The limitations of conventional solenoids will be explained and reasons given to show that as they are made more powerful their speed of operation decreases. 33</page><page sequence="17">790121-790128 HELENOID actuators are capable of armature travel times in less than one millisec irrespective of preloads or masses, despite the larger size and power required as the duty increases. The relationships between eddy currents and flux penetration; materials and flux leakage; induc- tance and power supply are illustrated, together with the way they are all interconnected and varying with time, requiring a comprehensive computer program to design for optimum performance. 1979 SA E Transactions 790121.

Rohles, Jr., Kansas State Univ.; and Stan B. Wallis, The Ford Motor Co. From 1973 to 1977 a series of laboratory tests involving almost 3000 people were conducted to determine the factors that contribute to the thermal comfort of auto- mobile passengers while using air conditioning under summer heat loads. Four studies will be reviewed. In the first study, 2200 subjects were exposed for 45 min. to an environment of 110°F/40% in a 1973 Ford vehicle for the purpose of evaluating the effects of the register size, the air flow rate and the discharge air temperature on comfort. The results showed that while the register size does not affect the time to reach a comfortable condition, the time to reach comfort in the front seat varies from 4 minutes with an air flow of 400 cfm (50°F discharge air at 10 minutes) to 18 minutes with 150 cfm (60°F discharge air); in the rear seat, the corresponding times were 8.5 and 39 minutes. In the second study designed to define the criteria for comfort during a prolonged stabilized period after a transient cool-down, a simulated 20 mph 30 minute cool-down followed by a 60 minute 50 mph steady-state condition was simulated when the chamber environment was 1 10°F/40% RH; during the third study that followed, the environment was 90°F/70% RH. The results dem- onstrated that the average time to reach comfort was reduced by 55% when the temperature was reduced from 110°F to 90°F; at 90°F the blower speed was changed more frequently by a factor of 3; the register vane setting was changed the same number of times in both studies; and the average time the front seat passengers deflected the register plumes off themselves was the same in both conditions. Because a difference was uncovered in the results of the cool-down tests, a fourth study was conducted to determine if the difference in the comfort response was dependent on seasonal acclimation. In tests conducted in the summer and the winter, the subjects tested in the winter exhibited a thermal sensation response that was higher than the subjects who were tested in the summer and the time required for the subjects who were tested in the winter to reach a condition of comfort was longer than for the subjects who were tested in the summer. 1979 SA E Transactions 790124. Heating and Air Conditioning a Heavy Truck. C. J. McĻachlan, Ford Motor Co. Designing a climate control system for a new highway tractor is a multi-phase project. This paper outlines the process and the various challenges each step presented, starting with outside temperatures and going through zone controls, register placement, system design, heat transfer components and testing. From the different steps emerged a multiple heat- er/evaporator system with performance superior to existing designs. The system has three sets of controls which provide a means of regulating the temperature in the driver, passenger and sleeper areas of the cab. The paper also describes the various packaging concepts investigated, how the choice of vacuum as a power medium for the controls was selected and briefly outlines the testing conducted on the new design. 790126. An Energy Model Structure for Predicting En- ergy Usage. Tony F. Daugherty, General Motors Inst. This paper contains the methodological and empirical results of an investigation into the energy consumption characteristics of a GM manufacturing plant. In exam- ining the energy portfolios of a particular plant, two statements can be made concerning the energy sources. Their level of utilization should be: a) directly correlated, in some degree, to endogenous variables such as direct labor hours, production volume, degree days, etc., and b) impacted significantly by any "visible" change in the composition of the technologies, the physical aspects of the work environment, and the labor force. The question to be answered is "which variables are directly related to energy consumption?" In answer to that query, a model is constructed to account for future energy usage, by source, within the manufacturing environment. Data was collected from eight plants for a twenty-eight month time period. Results for the models are given by two criteria, R2 and the standard error of the estimate as a percent of the response mean. 1979 SA E Transactions 790128. Some Design Considerations of Automotive Gas Turbines. Robert A. Mercure, Dept. of Energy, Div. of Transportation, Energy Conservation. An examination of some design considerations of gas turbine automobile engines is made including an overview of the unsolved problems. Emphasis is placed on the design and manufacturing aspects. 34</page><page sequence="18">790129-790133 Performance penalties due to size effects are dis- cussed. The gains in cycle thermal efficiency with increasing peak temperatures are examined in view of these penalties. A cursory investigation of thermal efficiency is performed on a 75 horsepower and a 150 horsepower gas turbine. This was done considering both current and advanced design and manufacturing tech- nology with regard to rotor clearances and blade thick- nesses. Design and manufacturing limits used in defining the penalties in engines with advanced technology are qualified. This investigation indicates an improvement of about 15 percent in thermal efficiency due to increasing the peak cycle temperature from 1850° F to 2500° F for a gas turbine engine suitable for an automobile but requiring advanced technology. It was also found that the size effects between 150 horsepower and 75 horsepower only result in about a 2 percent penalty. With current design and manufacturing technology, the increase in thermal efficiency reduces from 15 to 10 percent assuming that ceramics can be utilized to achieve a 2500° F turbine inlet temperature. If a ceramic turbine rotor does not become a reality and the cycle temperature is thereby limited by the capability of some type of metallic rotor, then the gain in thermal efficiency further reduces to about 5 percent. 790129. Field Experience with the Detroit Diesel Allison 404/505 Industrial Gas Turbine Engines. Eugene E. Flanigan and Daniel N. Nigro, Detroit Diesel Allison, General Motors Corp. Detroit Diesel Allison Division of General Motors Corporation has been conducting a field evaluation program on the 300 hp GT-404-3 and the 390 hp GT-505-3 Industrial Gas Turbine Engines over the time period from late 1974 until late 1977. This paper describes the overall program plan which involved installations in trucks, coaches, marine and industrial applications and the field experience which has been accumulated to date. Emphasis will be placed on operator reaction, environ- mental effects, performance and field revealed problems. Two particular applications will be explored in considerable detail; bulk hauling trucks with self un- loading capabilities and the Greyhound inter-city coach operation with gas turbine power and automatic trans- missions. 790130. (SP-438) Anatomy of the Human Cervical Spine and Associated Structures. D. F. Huelke, Univ. of Michigan Medical School. The anatomy of the major structures of the neck are presented including the anterior throat structures and the components of the cervical spine and associated struc- tures. Basic neck movements and generalized muscle actions are described. Anatomical relationships of the bones, ligaments, muscles and joints of the cervical spine are emphasized as a foundation for a clear understanding of the structural elements involved in neck fractures and dislocations. 1979 SA E Transactions 790131.

Mendelsohn, Prince Georges General Hospital; and J. W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute. In that the neck has a wide range of movements - flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation, there is a large variety of types of neck fractures and fracture-disloca- tions. This paper describes these various fractures and dislocations emphasizing the mechanisms as determined from clinical experience and potential, neurological damage. Fractures and fracture-dislocations with and without spinal cord involvement have been extensively described in the medical literature. This paper will give a brief overview of some of the types of fractures, as well as the mechanisms involved in these injuries. For more detailed descriptions, the reader is encouraged to review the articles in the list of suggested readings found in this symposium proceedings. 1979 SA E Transactions 790132. (SP-438) Cervical Fractures and Fracture-Dis- locations Sustained without Head Impact. D. F. Huelke, Univ. of Michigan Medical School; R. A. Mendelsohn, Prince Georges General Hos- pital; John D. States, Rochester General Hos- pital, Univ. of Rochester School of Medicine; and J. W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute. Because of its flexibility and structure, the cervical spine is disposed to various mechanisms of injury: although not so common as injuries caused by head impacts, cervical fractures and/or fracture-dislocations have been reported without direct impact to the head. Some cervical injuries reported have been sustained by wearers of lap and shoulder belts in auto accidents; however, we do not consider belt use a potential hazard because ample evidence has accrued in the medical and engineering literature to document general injury and fatality reduc- tion by use of seatbelts. We believe that in many instances occupants would be more seriously injured or killed were belts not worn. The present paper reviews reports of cervical injuries without head impact found in the literature and case histories of such injuries from the Highway Safety Research Institute of The University of Michigan, as well as experimental studies in animals, cadavers, and vol- unteer subjects. 1979 SA E Transactions 790133.

The cervical cord is a vital structure through which all impulses must travel from the trunk and limbs to reach the brain and also through which all impulses originating in the brain must pass to supply structures in the limbs and trunk. Knowledge of the anatomy of the cervical cord is a requisite to properly localize, diagnose and prognosticate on the effects of the trauma to which the cervical cord is subjected. 1979 SA E Transactions 790134.

(SP-438) Soft Tissue Injuries of the Neck. John D. States, Rochester General Hospital, Univ. of Rochester School of Medicine. Whiplash is a poorly defined term including ligamentous and muscle strains, hematomas, disc injuries, and less frequently, brain, eye and ear injuries. Diagnosis is difficult because clinical signs and Xrays, electro- myography and electroencephalography findings are few. Protection and rest will cure most patients within a year but approximately 2/5th of patients have permanent symptoms and disability. Rear-end impact accidents cause the head and neck to hyperextend over the seat back. Whiplash occurs in 38% of exposed occupants. Head rests give protection but differential rebound may occur producing injurious hyperextension and whiplash. The larynx, trachea and esophagus, in front of the spine, are injured by impact against the dash or steering wheel. Airway obstruction may occur and cause death if not restored quickly. Permanent disability can occur because of scarring and partial airway or esophagial obstruction or vocal cord damage. 1979 SA E Transactions 790136. (SP-438) Human Neck Injury Tolerance. J. W.

(SP-438) Biomechanical Analysis of Swimming Pool Neck Injuries. James McElhaney, Dept. of Biomedical Engrg., Duke Univ., Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan; John D. States, Rochester General Hospital, Univ. of Rochester School of Medicine; and M. Alexander Gabrielsen, Nova Univ. This paper presents an analysis of 67 neck injuries incurred in diving and sliding accidents in swimming pools. The accidents were investigated to establish the appropriate medical and mechanical factors involved. A mathematical model was developed to allow the predic- tion of the trajectory and velocity of the subjects prior to their injury. Nine of the accidents were selected for real life simulation. The simulation included the selection of test subjects of similar physical build to the accident victims who then performed the maneuvers leading to the injury, but in deeper water. High speed movies (200 frames per second) were taken, above and below the water, to measure the motion. A frame by frame analysis provided data to determine the trajectory and velocity profiles of the test subject. The maneuvers studied included diving from the pool edge, diving from various board types and sliding down various sliding board configurations. A potential injury mechanism due to a snap roll resulting from dropping the head and/or hands, causing a sudden increase in drag, was demonstrated. Information on dangerous impact velocities is presented through a comparison of the real accident and the simulation. The majority of the neck injuries were of the flexion-compression type resulting in fractures through the vertebral body and an anterior dislocation. 1979 SA E Transactions 790138. An Alternative Approach to Automotive Fuel Gauging. John Huddart, Dept. of Engrg. Sci- ence, Oxford Univ. (England). The need for accurate, high-resolution automobile fuel gauges is becoming increasingly felt and this can best be fulfilled with modern developments of the capacitance- measuring technique used for aircraft fuel tanks. An inexpensive probe is described which can be used, with suitable circuitry, to give a 0.1 gallon resolution and accuracy, from which the influence of slosh and tilt is effectively eliminated. A low-cost measuring circuit is described, based on CMOS astable oscillators, which produces digital readings virtually immune to noise, voltage and temperature changes, and the effects of ageing. 1979 SA E Transactions 790139. A Cylinder Pressure Sensor for Spark Advance Control and Knock Detection. Kent W. Randall, Systems Control, Inc.; and J. David Powell, Stanford Univ. 36</page><page sequence="20">790140-790146 A cylinder pressure time history has long been used as an indication of the performance of internal combustion engines. Recently the use of cylinder pressure has been proposed for the knock adaptive closed loop control of spark advance. The ultimate practicality of such a scheme depends heavily on the cost and reliability of a sensor to make this measurement. This paper describes the design, associated analysis, and the experimental performance of a potentially inexpensive sensor. The transducer is shown to be suitable for determination of the crank angle at the peak cylinder pressure and for detection of incipient detonation through the associated high frequency cylinder pressure oscil- lations. Furthermore, implementation of the sensor in a closed loop spark control system is briefly described. The sensor has proven to be adequate for spark advance control purposes. 1979 SA E Transactions 790140. Titania Exhaust Gas Sensor for Automotive Applications. M. J. Esper, E. M. Logothetis and J. C.

Characteristics of Zr02-Type Oxygen Sensors for Automotive Applications. C. T. Young and J. D. Bode, The Bendix Corp., Bendix Research Labs, Southfield, MI. The characteristics of Zr02-type oxygen sensors for closed-loop control of the air-fuel mixture for automotive engines were investigated. New sensors, sensors tested in dynamometers and road vehicles, and lead-poisoned sensors were characterized as to their performance in terms of voltage output, switching response, internal resistance and voltage-A switching behavior. New sensors behaved as ideal sensors at temperatures above 400° C, and behaved non-ideally at temperatures below 350°C. Sensors subjected to dynamometer and vehicle tests showed a gradual degradation in output voltage and steepness of their voltage-X switch. Their internal resis- tances and lean-to-rich switching times increased with use while the rich-to-lean switching times decreased. Self- recovery of a sensor from lead poisoning occurred during subsequent vehicle operation with lead-free fuel. 1979 SA E Transactions 790144. A Ratiometric Temperature Sensor. Peter J. Sacchetti, Research and Development Dept., New England Instrument Co., Natick, MA. A new type of Ratiometric Temperature Sensor has been developed which shows considerable promise in the measurement of engine intake manifold fuel/air charge temperatures. The device consists of a conductive plastic potentiometer, driven by an integral bimetallic sensing element. The Ratiometric Temperature Sensor closely tracks the rapidly fluctuating temperature of the fuel/air charge, and provides a linear ratiometric output voltage ranging from 15% to 85% of the total supply voltage over the sensed temperature range of -40°C to + 125°C. Output accuracy is ±3°C over a temperature range of + 20°C to +100°C. 790145. A New Temperature Sensor. Robert N. Lesnick and Murray Spector, Alpha Advanced Tech- nology, Inc., A Subsidiary of Alpha Metals, Inc. A new technology for temperature sensors has been developed. The sensors are extremely rugged, capable of withstanding the most rigorous environments, and they are expected to result in very inexpensive product manufacture. This paper discusses the evolution of the design of metal core hybrid substrates and the principles of construction of a temperature sensor as a hybrid circuit on a metal core substrate. Sensor performance characteristics and cost are also explored. A discussion of the linearity of voltage response to temperature is included, and data are presented on the performance of the sensor in various environments. The paper concludes that the new sensor is suitable for operation in all environments found in automotive applications, and that its range is sufficient to accom- modate all of the control functions currently found in the literature. 790146. Composite Applications to Aircraft Structures Now and in the Future. L. M. Lackman, M. A. Price and T. T. Matoi, Los Angeles Div., Rockwell International, Los Angeles, CA. The primary force behind composite materials devel- opment for aircraft applications was to achieve weight savings in weight-critical regions. In today's aircraft technology, graphite/epoxy composites are fulfilling this need and are being used as structural materials in the form of cross-plied fiber-reinforced laminates for conventional monolithic wing/empennage skins and substructure, or as face sheets on honeycomb-type structure. All metal components have been replaced by composite structure on 37</page><page sequence="21">790147-790154 aircraft such as the B-l, F-18, and AV-8B. Weight/cost savings were demonstrated for the B-l aircraft in which not only weight savings, but also cost competitiveness were the goals. The next-generation aircraft will incor- porate composites in a significantly larger proportion of the airframe structure to exploit more fully all advan- tageous characteristics of advanced composite structure (strength, stiffness, tailorability, weight, and fabrication cost savings). This paper describes some of the various applications of composite materials on today's aircraft using state- of-the-art technology, and the various innovative integral advanced composite design and fabrication concepts as well as aeroelastic tailoring which can be used on future aircraft systems to achieve the overall objective of higher efficiency at lower cost. 1979 SA E Transactions 790147. Composite Horizontal Stabilizer for the B-l - Design, Fabrication, and Test. Arthur August, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. The composite design for the B-l stabilizer was developed to satisfy all of the form, fit, and functional requirements of the aircraft and to be competitive with the metal stabilizer on both a weight and production cost basis. Actual weights of the composite stabilizer show a 15 percent savings for the total stabilizer and a 21 percent savings for the composite torque box over the existing metal configuration. Cost savings of 17 to 20 percent are estimated in production. The design that evolved from this effort, the test data generated to validate the concept, the fabrication pro- cedures used, and production cost comparisons are presented. 1979 SA E Transactions 790148.

In this paper an inductive system is de- scribed, utilizing a Wiegand trigger which provides constant angular dwell. The magnetic circuit of the Wiegand trigger has been further developed to permit its easy incorporation in a conventional automotive dis- tributor. All of the electronics, including a unique electronic advance circuit are incorporated in the dis- tributor bowl. 790149. Adhesives for the Bonding of Graphite/Glass Composites. Probir K. Guha and Joseph N. Epel, The Budd Company, The Plastic Research and Development Center, Troy, Michigan. An adhesive bonding study was conducted to generate data required for the full utilization of graphite and continuous glass reinforced plastics. From the screening of a wide range of acrylic, epoxy, and urethane adhesives, one adhesive of each kind was selected for further evaluation. The screening was done on the basis of strength comparisons of adhesive bonded samples at elevated temperatures and under different surface treat- ments, cure cycle, and bond thickness conditions. Envi- ronmental effects, such as heat and humidity exposure on pre-stressed and unstressed samples, have also been studied for some of the selected adhesives. 1979 SA E Transactions 790150. Automated Structural Bonding Systems for Graphite and Other High-Strength Composites. William R. Schmitz and Thomas G. Rabito, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Adhesive Div., Ashland, OH. Structural bonding of reinforced plastics has been success- fully utilized for ten years or more in a variety of automotive applications; such as, truck front-end assem- blies, pickup box covers, utility vehicle tops, etc. Uses have been for relatively low-volume applications, and the adhesive bonding has been accomplished by manual application of the adhesive rather than with automated equipment. With the emerging interest in utilizing reinforced plastics for applications on large-volume vehicles such as passenger cars and light trucks, it becomes necessary to develop ways of speeding up the adhesive bonding operation to keep up with assembly line requirements. This paper will present our background and expe- rience in structural bonding of reinforced plastics and discuss new technology in adhesives, application equip- ment, and high-strength composites for future uses in the automotive industry. 790151. Structural Adhesives for Rapid Cure Applications. C. Lynn Mahoney, Hysol Div., The Dexter Corp. Use of structural adhesives on automotive assembly lines requires systems compatible with a variety of metal and polymer substrates, minimal surface preparation and short cure or part handling times. Various types of structural adhesives have been considered in relation to the above needs. Some adhesive types bond well to unprepared surfaces, but all give improved performance with proper surface treatment. Most structural adhesives need tem- peratures ranging from 65°C (150°F) to as high as 230°C (450° F) to give the desired short cure times. Good bond strengths can be achieved under such cure conditions. New modified acrylic adhesives show promise for fast cure use at ambient temperatures. 1979 SA E Transactions 790154.

How to Buy an Aerial Device for a Utility Truck. Weston R. Poyner, Cranes Pitman Div., A. B. Chance Co. Powered manlift or aerial devices vary in cost, complexity and size from a simple truck mounted ladder to 150 foot devices mounted on crane carrier chassis. Considerations pertinent to the purchase of one are - height of work to be performed, insulated or non-insulated, load to be lifted, required side reach, travel height, number and span of outriggers, and whether the unit should articulate fully, non-overcenter or be a telescoping boom. Ease of maintenance is also a consid- eration. Articulated units often give a better choice of working positions and facilitate field side work. Telescoping units are generally preferred when work- ing through heavy trees. The purchase of a device larger than required can squander much capital both in the device itself and in the chassis required to mount the device. Consideration must also be given to whether or not plant is to be placed from the unit and what type of tooling will be used in conjunction with it. The upper portion of the device will need to be dielectric for electric utilities and the working voltage must be decided upon and specified as well as whether or not a dielectric liner is to be used.

The correct mounting is not necessarily the most expensive nor perhaps the one you have been using all these past years. There are some important factors you must consider before mounting your mechanized equipment. 790157. Life Testing of Lead Acid Batteries for Electric Vehicle Duties. J. M. Ponsford, Lucas Batteries Ltd. (England). The lead-acid couple is potentially capable of fulfilling the battery requirement for high performance electric delivery vehicles in the one tonne payload category. Development of such a battery, combining high energy density and good cycle life, involves extensive and painstaking testing. During the course of the Lucas development programme test methods and procedures have been evolved to ensure that the battery array with its supporting equipment is capable of fully performing the tasks required of it in such an application. Much of the experience gained is appli- cable to any electrochemical couple being developed for electric vehicle use. 790158. Electric Vehicle Battery Development. Charles W. Fleischmann, ELTRA Electric Vehicle Group/C&amp;D-Prestolite, Plymouth Meeting, PA. Various types of lead-acid batteries have developed because of different market needs. The small, uncertain market for electric vehicles has been met by modifying traction-type or golf-car type lead-acid batteries. Recently, governmental stimulation of the market for passenger electric vehicles has resulted in the design and development of batteries to meet specific performance goals for electric vehicle propulsion. The approach which the Eitra Electric Vehicle Group/C&amp;D-Prestolite has taken toward meeting the governmental goals involves the use of expanded metal, non-antimonial grids, overpasted plates, reduced electrolyte and an enveloped, glass mat retention system. 790159. 240 VDC Electric Vehicle System. K. R. Jones, Globe-Union, Inc. The battery is the primary component limiting electric vehicle performance that equals today's standard of expectations as defined by the I.C. engine powered vehicles. Efforts to optimize the electric vehicle performance is leading many people to select and assemble the highest efficiency components available. High voltage electric vehicle power systems can provide performance advantages over lower voltage systems, but only if this voltage is in balance with the total system. Mixing high efficiency components does not insure total system efficiency optimization. The ability of a battery to release its stored energy is a function of its demand. Higher current demands will reduce the efficiency of a battery. This paper reveals how such a mismatch occurred and its reflection on what appeared to be a battery problem. 790160. Development Status and Experience of VART A's Battery Systems Gained on Electric Vehicles Tested in West Germany Under Actual Operating Conditions. Uwe Werner Peters, VARTA Bat- teries Ltd. (Canada). Report sums up performance data obtained on lead-acid batteries and accessories especially designed for electric 39</page><page sequence="23">790161-790168 road vehicles. Also encompasses special technologies such as central electrolyte refilling system, forced cooling and central venting. Further describes VARTA's latest accomplishments for reduced maintenance and improvement in reliability.

Furthermore, it presents development stage of VARTA's improved nickel-iron FENOX-battery. 790161. Thermal Management of the Lithium/Metal Sulfide Electric Vehicle. M. M. Farahat, J. A. E. Graae, A. A. Chilenskas and D. L. Barney, Argonne National Lab., Chemical Engrg. Div. Thermal management studies of the Lithium-Alumi- num/Metal Sulfide Battery demonstrate the need for a light weight, high thermal efficiency case for electric batteries. Calculations based upon the rectangular con- figured MK IA battery using vacuum-foil insulation, show that the heat loss rate goal of 400 watts can be met. Experimental studies directed at the determination of the reversible TAS heating gave results that compared within 8% with theoretically derived values. Calculations based upon the 50-kWh MK II battery and a 10,000 miles driven/year show that by utilizing the thermal storage capacity of the system, essentially no additional energy is needed to keep the battery hot. 1979 SA E Transactions 790162. A High Energy Tubular Battery for an 1800 kg Payload Electric Delivery Van. Michael L. Whitehead, Chloride Technical Ltd. (U.K.). A high energy lead-acid battery was developed to provide, at no extra cost, an 1800 kg (4000 lb) payload electric delivery van with a driving range of 80-90 km (50-55 miles). In addition to the new high performance elec- trodes, an integrated approach to the total power source concept evolved new lightweight designs for battery packaging and a system engineered battery charger and an automatic topping-up facility. Despite the 40% improvement in range compared with 55-65 km (35-40 miles) for conventional traction batter- ies, a 4 year battery life is expected due to the reinforcing features of the tubular design adopted for the positive electrode. 790164. Minimizing the Weight of Aluminum Body Pan- els. R. L. Rolf, M. L. Sharp and W. C. Herbein, Alcoa Technical Center, Aluminum Co. of America. General guidelines are provided in this paper that can minimize the weight of aluminum body panels. Denting, local stiffness, torsional and/or bending stiffness, strength, and vibration of body panels are considered. High strength alloys will provide the least panel weight when the governing criteria are denting, permanent set and crippling. Redesign to reduce size of unsupported outer panel areas or to increase inner panel rib size will provide the least weight when the governing criterion is stiffness. 1979 SA E Transactions 790165. Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding Process and Materials for Automotive Body Panels. David L. Simpkins, General Motors, Manufac- turing Development, Warren, Michigan. The Reaction Injection Molding (RIM) process is being used extensively for the production of soft urethane bumper faseias and offers many advantages compared to other polymer processes. The addition of fiber rein- forcement to R.I.M. urethanes has resulted in significant improvements in physical properties, making additional automotive applications possible. The development of Reinforced R.I.M. technology is currently underway at General Motors Manufacturing Development with a production scale mix-metering unit that was installed in September 1977. Reinforcement length and loading limitations, equipment wear and durability, and Reinforced R.I.M. physical properties are discussed. The advantages of Reinforced R.I.M. materials are also described along with potential automotive appli- cations. 1979 SA E Transactions 790166. Controlling the Physical Properties of RIM Urethanes with Non-Organic Reinforcement. C. J. MacGregor and R. A. Parker, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Logan, OH. Milled fiberglass or mica flake reinforcement can be used to control the physical properties of RIM urethanes. The addition of these reinforcements results in increased flexural modulus, decreased coefficient of linear thermal expansion, decreased elongation and decreased impact strength. Milled fiberglass is shown to orient during injection into the mold causing anisotropic behavior in the physical properties. Mica flake reinforced urethanes do not show the orientation effects found with milled fiberglass, but mica flake causes a greater reduction in elongation and impact than does milled fiberglass. Several urethane systems are examined and the general effects of mica flake or milled fiberglass are found to be reasonably independent of the base urethane system. 790168. High-Strength Steel Sheets for Automobile Body Panels. S. R. Goodman and P. R. Mould, United States Steel Corp., Research Lab., Monroeville, PA. The overall suitability of various steels (strain-aging steels such as capped nitrogenized and rephosphorized steels, killed rephosphorized and microalloyed steels) for au- tomobile body-panel applications is assessed by com- paring their characteristics with the performance re- quirements (formability, weldability, paintability, etc.). 40</page><page sequence="24">790169-790174 The formability of the steel sheets is perhaps the most important requirement for body-panel applications. To minimize the loss of formability that occurs as strength is increased, steels having yield strengths of 40 to 50 ksi are considered the primary candidates for use in body panels. Of the different types of 40- to 50-ksi steels reviewed, the killed rephosphorized steels (especially a silicon- containing version) show the best combination of form- ability and weldability. Although some difficulty in meeting paint-performance requirements has been recently reported with these steels, additional studies are needed to identify those factors that determine paint- ability in the killed rephosphorized steels. The future application of cold-rolled dual-phase steel sheets for body panels is discussed; the high strengths obtained after forming these steels offer greater weight savings potential provided adequate stiffness can be designed into the parts and provided the higher cost of the steels can be justified. 1979 SA E Transactions 790169. Reinforced Polyester in the European Automotive Industry. Herman Hablitzel, Volkswagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). Advance in technology and the necessity for conservation of energy have forced the design engineer to look closer to plastic materials in order to save weight of cars. The situation in Europe, and in particular the chances for fiber glass reinforced polyester are explained in detail. 1979 SA E Transactions 790170. Innovative Sheet Molding Compound Processes. Geary Y. Yee, Plastics Process Development Department, Manufacturing Development/Gen- eral Motors Corporation. The automotive industry is in the process of reducing vehicle weight to meet the Federal mandate for gas mileage. Lightweight sheet molding compound (SMC) can make a significant contribution. However, to be compet- itive with other improved lightweight materials, several changes in the standard compression molding process must take place. This paper will present the current work in sheet molding compound processes at General Motors Manufacturing Development. It covers the processes of programmable force velocity control, molded coating, and mold heat transfer analysis; and the concepts on compounding of SMC sheet and of a multi-station, high productivity compression molding line. 1979 SA E Transactions 790172. An Attenuation and Transport Delay Model for Single Point Closed-Loop Fuel Metering Sys- tems. Hai Wu and Paul N. Blumberg, Engi- neering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The paper presents a fuel modulation attenuation model for single point closed-loop fuel metering systems. The model calculates the attenuation of a metered air-fuel perturbation and the time delay in the transport of the perturbed signal from the metering point through the engine to the exhaust system as functions of the modu- lation frequency, engine RPM, intake manifold vacuum, and exhaust gas recirculation. Results are shown for a V-8 engine with sine wave, triangular wave and square wave modulations. It is found that the attenuation for the triangular wave is the highest and that for the square wave is the smallest It is also found that in general the attenuation increases with increasing modulation fre- quency and increasing EGR, but decreases with increas- ing RPM. The model can be extended to study the attenuation and transport delay of other engines and wave forms. 1979 SA E Transactions 790173. Energy Conservation with Increased Compression Ratio and Electronic Knock Control. James H. Currie, David S. Grossman and James J. Gumbleton, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Previous investigations have shown that fuel economy gains are possible in vehicles with increased compression ratio engines that meet 1978 Federal emission standards using oxidizing converter-EGR emission control systems. There has been no incentive to raise compression ratios, however, since the vehicle gains are offset by energy losses in the refinery due to refining the higher octane unleaded fuel required by high compression ratio engines. This paper discusses the application of an electronic closed loop knock control system to a higher compression ratio engine to allow operation on 91 Research Octane Number fuel. Two cars with different compression ratios are compared with both oxidizing converter - EGR and 3-way oxidizing-reducing converter-EGR closed loop carburetor emission control systems. 1979 SA E Transactions 790174. Software Design Verification in Real Time for Microprocessor Based Electronic Engine Control. Charles D. Durrett, Jr., Ford Motor Co., Allen Park, MI. Automotive electronic engine control systems require complex interactive software designs which must provide appropriate responses to a variety of engine conditions. Software design verification will help achieve a high level of confidence in the released product. Several approaches to software design verification are discussed. Each technique provides an additional degree of confidence with a corresponding level of effort. Primary attention is given to the time based stimulus generation, the real time performance measurements, time based tolerance gen- eration, and data reduction of a real time software design verification test system. A recommendation for future software design verification system capabilities is made. 41</page><page sequence="25">790175-790181 790175. A Fuel Control System for 0.4 Nox. Robert H. Parker, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group. Many studies have been launched to determine whether it is possible to achieve 0.4 gms/mile Nox. Most of those studies question or deny the ability to design and develop a system to reliably maintain 0.4 gms/mile Nox. This paper reviews the factors requiring consideration toward accomplishing that Nox objective and theorizes a system which should properly accommodate these considerations. Actual performance data is then presented on a commer- cially manufacturable system that demonstrates con- formance to the 0.4 Nox requirement without penalty to economy or driveability. Finally, considerations toward even superior performance are presented. 790176. The Disadvantage Function Technique for Optimization of Engine Control Strategies. Al- fred B. Bortz, Essex Group, Subsidiary of United Technologies. The advent of electronic control systems has enabled automobile manufacturers to consider a vast variety of fuel, ignition, and exhaust gas recirculation system calibrations. Given a control system providing satisfactory performance, it is important to determine the calibration of that system which minimizes fuel consumption while meeting emission control standards. The disadvantage function technique enables an engineer to determine such an optimal calibration through an interative procedure, interacting with a computer program. This paper describes the technique, illustrates it by example, and compares it with well-known optim- ization methods. 790177. Engine Control Optimization Via Nonlinear Programming. Harish S. Rao and A. I. Cohen, Systems Control Inc.; J. A. Tennant and K. L. Van Voorhies, Engineering Staff, General Mo- tors Corporation. A procedure has been developed for establishing optimum engine performance, in terms of fuel economy and exhaust emission constraints, as a function of spark advance, exhaust gas recirculation and air-to-fuel ratio. The salient features of the procedure are: (i) it is based on mathematical engine models that have been validated over a driving cycle on an engine dynamometer, (ii) it is based on solving a nonlinear programming problem with equality and inequality constraints, and (iii) the results of the optimization are used to develop control calibrations that can be implemented on a vehicle. This paper describes the procedure to determine optimal calibrations for a fuel injected spark ignition engine under warmed-up operating conditions. Validation of these results on an actual vehicle has yet to be demonstrated. 1979 SA E Transactions 790178. Development and Validation of Engine Models Via Automated Dynamometer Tests. J. A. Tennant and R. A. Giacomazzi, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation; J. D. Powell, Stanford University; and H. S. Rao, Systems Control Inc. An automated engine dynamometer test procedure is developed and mathematical models for the main engine control variables are derived from the resulting data base. The new procedure involves sequential testing at many speed/load conditions for various combinations of air fuel ratio, spark timing and exhaust gas recirculation. The total testing time required for generating the data base of more than 2000 test points is less than twelve hours. An independent transient speed/load test is also conducted for the purpose of validating the engine models. The measured and model predicted data are compared for this test which corresponds to a segment of the EPA urban schedule. 790179. Spark Ignition Engine Fuel Economy Control Optimization - Techniques and Procedures. Thomas Trella, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Admin., Cam- bridge, MA. An analysis is presented for the quantitative evaluation of spark ignition engine control parameters (spark advance, air-to-fuel ratio, exhaust gas recirculation) for optimal fuel economy, constrained emission levels and tradeoffs. Emphasis is placed on the procedures and techniques adopted for the off-line approach using steady state mapping dynamometer data of conventional engines in production. The analysis structure is composed primarily of existing documented tools, in particular, a) vehicle simulation programs, b) FTP-urban and highway drive cycle schedule, c) multiple regression techniques, and d) dynamic programming procedures. Analytical methods are evaluated along with illustrative examples, and discussions are presented on their sensitivities. Appli- cations of engine control parameter optimizations are also illustrated with reference to two engine (one eight and one four cylinder) data bases. Major factors are discussed. Results are presented on fuel economy as a function of three regulated emissions and engine settings, and on increase/decrease in fuel economy concerned with the emission constraint, emission constrol strategy, and vehicle drive cycle. 790181. (SP-443) Characterization of Wheel-Roadway Interaction for Recreational Vehicles. Thomas R. Kane and Guy K. Man, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA. Seven mathematical models for the interaction of a pneumatic tire with a roadway are analyzed. This study involves a single-wheel trailer, and it is assumed that the tire and roadway touch each other at only one point. Results of numerical solutions of equations of motion are given in graphical form for the first four models. 42</page><page sequence="26">790182-790188 Significant disparities are found among the predictions of the various theories.

(SP-443) Effect of Hitchpoint Lateral Stiffness on Trailer Stability. T. R. Robe, Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. The effect on trailer stability of hitchpoint lateral stiffness and damping is examined by means of a simplified model. The model used in the stability analysis is a one degree of freedom nonholonomic dynamical system and yields a third order linear differential equation. Trailer stability criteria are developed, and stability charts are presented which depict the stability criteria in terms of non- dimensional parameters. The analysis shows that increas- ing hitchpoint lateral stiffness does not improve trailer stability whereas increasing hitchpoint lateral damping is much more important to trailer stability. In addition, the importance of hitchpoint loading to trailer stability is shown. 790183. (SP-443) The Influence of Drawbar Flexibility and Roll Steer on the Stability of Articulated Vehicles. D. B. Johnson, J. C. Huston and T. A. Gray, Engrg. Science and Mechanics Dept., Iowa State Univ. Recently, Taylor and Kane have drawn attention to the potentially destabilizing influence of drawbar flexibility on the stability of articulated vehicles. They assumed that roll freedom does not affect stability. Moncarz, however, used a model that did not include drawbar flexibility and concluded that roll has a significant influence. Two questions are addressed in this paper. How do roll steer and drawbar flexibility affect stability? Are these effects independent? Comparisons of the stability predictions from four different articulated vehicle models lead to the conclusions that both roll steer and drawbar flexibility can have significant effects on stability and that these effects are not independent. 1979 SA E Transactions 790184. (SP-443) Relative Significance of Parameters Affecting Lateral Stability of Articulated Recreational Vehicles. J. C. Huston and D. B. Johnson, Dept. of Engrg. Science and Mechan- ics, Iowa State Univ. A seven-degrees-of-freedom model of an articulated recreational vehicle is described and used to determine the relative significance of parameters and of degrees of freedom that affect lateral stability. Thirty-five parameters are used to describe tire-road interactions, roll freedom, suspension systems, geometry, mass distribution, the hitch, the drawbar, and the forward speed. Critical speeds associated with different systems are calculated. Com- parisons of these critical speeds lead to conclusions important to the design and safe operation of articulated recreational vehicles. 1979 SA E Transactions 790185. (SP-443) A Simplified Analysis of the Steady- State Turning of Articulated Vehicles. Chris E. Passerello, Michigan Technological Univ. The steady-state turning behavior of vehicles pulling trailers is formulated in a simplified manner using the concept of a handling diagram. The formulation assumes small slip angles but admits a non-linear relationship between the slip angle and side force of the tires. 790186. (SP-443) Determination of Trailer Stability Through Simple Analytical Methods and Test Procedures. Richard H. Klein and Henry T. Szostak, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper provides approximate factors, measurement techniques, and test procedures that can be used to determine trailer stability. The recommended perform- ance metric is damping ratio, or an equivalent cycle to half amplitude which is evaluated, via a pulse-steer procedure, at some reference speed. A minimum damping ratio criteria of 0.15 at 55 mph is suggested and compared to the results of recent full scale tests. The approach is useful in selecting a minimum value of hitch load (for various weight tow cars) that will insure a minimum acceptable level of trailer stability at highway speeds. 1979 SA E Transactions 790187. (SP-443) Steady Turning of Two-Wheeled Ve- hicles. Guy K. Man and Thomas R. Kane, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA. Steady turning of two-wheeled vehicles is examined in terms of a theory accommodating large lean angles and a realistic representation of wheel-roadway interaction. Quantitative and qualitative relationships between rider and vehicle behavior are explored in detail, and a parameter study is performed with a view to facilitating design. 1979 SA E Transactions 790188. (SP-443) Off-Road Stability of Recreational Vehicles. A. M. Strauss, Engrg. Science Dept., Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH. An attempt is made to describe the stability of vehicles on very rough terrain that may have large slopes. The basic premise of the paper is that the theory of ship stability is more applicable to problems of this kind than the traditional on-road vehicle stability theories. The linear theory is discussed as is driving on a rough slope, pitching, vertical oscillations and large angles. The methods of catastrophe theory as presented originally by Zeeman are used in an attempt to explain the behavior of the off-road vehicles. 43</page><page sequence="27">790189-790201 790189.

Bockstiegel and M. Strömgren, PM-Process Development, Höganäs AB (Sweden). On the premises of Höganäs Central Laboratory in Sweden, a fully automated PM-forging system has been installed as a pilot-line for the development of actual components at the services of interested clients and for the study of technological and economic aspects of the process under production-like conditions. A description of the forging line is given, high-lighting its main features. A selection of PM-forged components is presented which have been developed on this line on contract bases for various clients. Examples are given of forging know-how extracted from experiments utilizing the de- scribed equipment. 1979 SA E Transactions 790192. Machining Studies of PM-Forged Materials. R. Coos and G. Bockstiegel, PM-Process Devel- opment, Höganäs AB (Sweden); and C. Muhrén, Technical Development, Volvo-Flygmotor AB (Sweden). Three typical PM-forged steels made from Höganäs powders have been studied with regard to their machining behaviour, utilizing a special machinability test developed and utilized since 1960 by Volvo AB in Sweden. This test permits to rate steels relative to a standardized free- machining steel. Guided by the results from this test, recommendable cutting data for turning, milling, drilling, tapping and reaming of the three PM-forged materials have been established empirically. It is concluded that all three materials machine notably better than a common tough-hardening steel, two of them as good and one of them better than a common constructional steel. Meas- ured cutting and machine parameters for the PM-forged materials scattered notably less than those for comparable wrought steels. 790194. Energy Conservation in a Powder Metai Sintering Operation. Terry W. Lee, Lovejoy Inc. With the exception of particular equipment manufacturers designs, this sintering system is typical of gas fired, muffle type, sintering equipment in the powder metal industry and the energy conservations methods employed are generally applicable to similar operations. Specifically, these conservation techniques focus on (1) the conser- vation of natural gas utility by waste heat recovery from the sintering operation and (2) the reduction of natural gas usage by the substitution of nitrogen base atmosphere in place of the endothermic process. 790195.

Blade Type Fuses for Electrical Circuit Protec- tion. Kenneth R. Audino, Littelfuse, Inc. A new blade fuse has been developed for low voltage (32 volts or less) automotive applications. Due to its smaller size and greater reliability it offers many advantages not previously available with cartridge type fuses. To insure proper interfacing in the automobile's electrical system, it is important to understand what a fuse is, what are its performance characteristics and how are they evaluated, and how the typical vehicle environment can affect fuse performance and to what extent. Only with such information can the circuit designer optimize his selection of the correct fuse for safe, inexpensive and trouble-free circuit protection. 1979 SA E Transactions 790200. Halogen Sealed Beam Headlamps. Ralph A. Ehrhardt, Miniature Lamp Dept., General Elec- tric Co. Recent admendments to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 open new markets for headlamps of sealed construction utilizing the higher efficiency halogen regenerative cycle light sources. The terminology related to halogen-cycle lamps and the chemical/thermal cycle phenomena are explained for the automotive lighting engineers and references will allow researchers to review previous work. The history and practical applications of halogen lamps is traced from 1912 to the present halogen sealed beam headlamps that are available on numerous 1979 model automobiles. The new halogen sealed beam headlamps may be the initial step toward evolutionary new headlamp designs, involving new materials and new manufacturing processes to meet the changing needs of the automotive industry and society. 1979 SA E Transactions 790201.

Carburetor Deposits and Their Control. L. M. Gibbs and C. E. Richardson, Chevron Research Co. The effects of unleaded gasoline properties on the formation of carburetor deposits were studied by ana- lyzing data from six field tests and by conducting a laboratory engine test program which investigated a wide range of gasoline properties. The results showed that increasing sulfur, nonbasic nitrogen, olefin, and existent gum contents and 10% and 90% evaporation points increased carburetor throttle body deposits. The most practical and economical way to control carburetor deposits is with the use of an effective deposit control additive. Such an additive can also clean up and keep clean critical areas of a new design variable venturi carburetor. Problems of measuring fleet fuel economy are also discussed. 1979 SAE Transactions 790203. The Effects of Fuel Composition and Fuel Additives on Intake System Detergency of Jap- anese Automobile Engines. T. Nishizaki, Y. Maeda, K. Date and T. Maeda, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd. The effects of fuel composition and additives (antioxidant and detergent) on intake system cleanliness have been studied using Japanese automobile engines equipped with EGR systems. The following conclusions were obtained. Cleanliness of the intake system (carburetor and intake manifold) is influenced remarkably by the fuel characteristics, namely the olefin content and the type of antioxidant. The detergent gives a large improvement in the cleanliness of carburetors and intake manifolds, but shows little or no effect on the intake valves. A carrier oil used together with the detergent does reduce the deposit formation especially on the intake valves. The increase of the aromatic content appears to augment the deposits on the cylinder head. 790204. A Novel Laboratory Method for Evaluating Induction System Deposits in Gasoline Engines. H. W. Marbach, Jr., A. A. Johnston and J. N. Bowden, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Lab., Southwest Research Inst., San Antonio, TX; and M. E. LePera, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research &amp; Development Command, Energy and Water Resources Lab., Fort Belvoir, VA. This report covers work undertaken at the U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Laboratory to develop a laboratory bench procedure for the evaluation of dispersant-detergent gasoline additive effectiveness used for the control and/or inhibition of carburetor and engine intake system deposition. The development of the syn- thetic crankcase off-gas liquid in Phase I of this project has made it possible to develop a bench procedure that correlates to actual engine results in: 1. The carburetor throttle plate and throat area, 2. The induction system (port and valve areas), and 3. Additive effectiveness. The apparatus is simple in design and operation, and provides the advantage of evaluating both carburetor and intake deposits simultaneously. 790205.

New 5- and 6-Cylinder VW Diesel Engines for Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks. Karlhans Sator, Werner Buttgereit and Ulrich Sturzebecher, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). In the years following the introduction of the 4-cylinder diesel engine for the Volkswagen Rabbit, 5- and 6-cylinder diesel engines were developed for passenger cars and light duty trucks. As in the 4-cylinder version these engines employ the swirl chamber process. They are in-line OHC configurations with bucket tappets and with the valves being parallel to the cylinder axis. Cylinder volume is 400 cm3. For the passenger car version power output of the 5-cylinder engine is 50 kW, and 60 kW for the 6-cylinder engine both at a rated speed of 4800 rpm. Cast iron cylinder blocks and aluminum cylinder heads are used. The paper describes the basic design, development highlights and gives the performance characteristics such as of power, durability, emissions and fuel economy. 790207.

A combined compressor- and engine air-flow-map of the turbocharged gasoline-engine is developed and the fea- 45</page><page sequence="29">790208-790216 tures of a compressor matching the special requirements of a TC gasoline engine are deduced from this map. The position of the throttle in the intake-system, which has great influence on governing-qualities and load-change- response of a turbocharged gasoline engine is discussed and the problems and disadvantages of a waste-gate governed turbocharger especially in connection with a gasoline engine are figured out. 790208.

In an effort to make the diesel engine vehicle as convenient to drive, as is a spark ignitioned vehicle, Oldsmobile designed a fast warm-up glow plug control system. The new system attains glow plug operating temperature in about 6.5 seconds, compared to 60 seconds for the system it replaces. This paper details the system design which is based on feedback control of a model of the glow plugs. 790209. A New Process for FRP Auto Parts. Robert G. Nelb, Bailey Div., USM Corp. An economical and proven new process for manufac- turing large automotive parts in high volume is exciting Detroit. The Bailey Division of USM Corporation, an Emhart Subsidiary, has demonstrated commercially that large automotive parts can be injection molded using glass-fiber reinforced thermoset polyester polymers. More particularly, the process lends itself to the manufacture of parts with Class A surfaces without sink marks from ribs and bosses showing. There are advantages for the design engineer, the parts manufacturer and the assembly plant. Dimensionally stable, light weight Class A surface parts that can be painted on the body assembly paint line can now be made using readily available raw materials. 790210.

Production forming trials were conducted to deter- mine the feasibility of producing higher-strength cold- rolled AK rephosphorized body panels with production low-strength tooling and if press modifications were necessary to produce acceptable higher-strength parts. In addition, laboratory spot-welding characteristics of high- er-strength AK rephosphorized steels were examined to compare weldability to weldability data generated for lower-strength AK steel. Case studies described indicate that higher-strength AK rephosphorized steels can be substituted for lower- strength steels with minimal sacrifice in formability and spot weldability. - 790212. Use of a Couette High-Shear-Rate Viscometer for Measuring the Viscosity of Engine Lubricants. B. Wright and J. Mather, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre (Chester/England). A Couette viscometer is described which is capable of measuring the viscosity of engine lubricants at a temper- ature of 150°C and shear rates from 105 to 106 s-1. A novel feature of the instrument is the introduction of an electrical capacitance method for measuring the size of the annular gap. Operating procedures are discussed in detail and mathematical corrections are established for dealing with temperature rise in the test sample. Viscometric data for some single-grade oils and multigrade oils are presented. 790214. Assessment of Shear Stability Methods for European Engine Oils. E. W. Spooren, s.a. Texaco Belgium n.v.; S. W. Rein and D. L. Alexander, Texaco Inc. The high temperature permanent and temporary vis- cosities of oils run in a diesel injector shear stability test were compared with similar data for two European laboratory engine tests. Low shear rate permanent viscosity losses for oils run in selected European cars were compared with laboratory data. Shear stability as commonly determined by the diesel injector test and low shear rate viscosity measurements does not permit adequate assessment of the shear stability of engine oils. The viscosities measured at high shear rates and high temperatures appear to provide a more useful dimension in the characterization of oils than do standard viscosity measurements. Temporary viscosity losses tend to be larger than permanent viscosity losses. 790215. Durability of Decorative Electroplated Plastics for Exterior Automotive Use - A Review. Douglas A. Thompson, Shipley Co., Inc., Newton, MA. The resin, part design, moulding process, preplate process and electroplate structure, have an interrelationship that determine part durability of electroplated plastics in the exterior automotive environments. Explanation of these interrelationships is given to assist in proper application of electroplated plastics for this use. 1979 SA E Transactions 790216. Organic Coatings for Automotive Plastics. R. R. Koch, Automotive OEM; and Eric Pelf rey, Chemical Coatings Div., The Sherwin-Williams Co. With the onset of newer plastics for the weight reduction program in automobiles, the finishing process becomes more complex. The organic coating must adhere to the substrate without destroying the desirable properties of 46</page><page sequence="30">790217-790225 the plastic. Factors, such as cure temperature of the coating, must be less than the heat distortion temperature of the plastic, crazing, embrittlement and adhesion must be considered. With the new EPA regulations, the desired coatings will tend to be high solids or water. 790217. Decorative Metallizing by Magnetron Sputtering - Effects of Geometry on Film Properties. D. W. Hoffman and P. J. Goodsmith, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The configurations of sputtering sources and the shape and orientation of parts to be coated exert a strong influence on the appearance and integrity of metallized decorative coatings. Magnetron sputtering sources, which have sufficient speed and low substrate heating for the practical metallizing of plastic automotive parts, are also characterized by extended shapes that influence the properties of the deposited films. Data are presented for the film stresses and reflectances of pure chromium and Cr-alloy coatings sputtered from planar and cylindrical sources. The cylindrical post magnetron geometry en- hances the production of compressive film stresses that prevent cracking, while also maximizing the optical reflectance. Results are also presented for the effects of substrate orientation and rotation on the stresses and reflectance of pure chromium and stainless steel coatings. While oblique deposition and parts rotation cause tensile stress and loss of brightness, these effects can be mitigated by the careful design and positioning of parts, by the judicious choice of coating metal or alloy, and by the use of advantageous sputtering target geometries. 1979 SA E Transactions 790218. Directly Electroplateable Resins. D. Luch, Alloy Polymers Div. of MPD Technology Corp. Recent discoveries have made possible the development of directly electroplateable plastic resins. New additives to electrically conductive carbon-filled plastics overcome previous problems of adhesion and slow electrodeposit coverage times and promote chemical bonding between the plastic and electrodeposit. A review of injection molding and electroplating practices for these new materials is presented. It is shown that the chemical bonding mechanism and the elimination of preplating offer economic, fabrication and design advantages com- pared to conventional methods for plating on plastic. 790219. Four Steps for Vehicle Ride Improvement. Jack W. Martz, Edward L. Peterson, Gerald W. Knobeloch and G. D. Angus, Structural Dy- namics Research Corp., Milford, OH. Structural Dynamics Research Corporation has been involved in the development and application of advanced testing and analysis techniques for improving the vibra- tion performance of vehicles for over ten years. Tech- niques such as narrow band spectrum analysis, modal testing, and building block simulation have been the topic of several technical papers, and have been widely accepted by the automotive industry as useful techniques for vehicle vibration improvement. In this paper, the authors describe a new method of application of modal analysis and building block tech- nology which has been made possible by advances in minicomputer software. Examples of recent projects performed by SDRC are described, which illustrate how a test engineer can identify and evaluate various fixes to a vehicle vibration problem utilizing a minicomputer based hardware-software system in his laboratory. SDRC engineers in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe are employing these methods today on a variety of American and foreign automobiles. 1979 SA E Transactions 790220. Vibration Control Using Additive Damping and FFT Analysis. John P. Henderson, Air Force Materials Lab.; and Michael L. Drake, Univ. of Dayton Research Institute. With digital Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, which enables rapid identification of resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and modal parameters, a designer can optimize viscoelastic damping material applications for real structures. This paper will discuss the use of FFT analysis in the design of damping applications for eliminating resonant high cycle fatigue in specific light weight structural components. 790221. Parameter Estimation Techniques for Modal Analysis. D. L. Brown, R. J. Allemang and Ray Zimmerman, Univ. of Cincinnati; and M. Mergeay, Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven. Parameter estimation techniques that can be used to determine modal parameters (frequency, damping, and mode shape) from experimentally measured frequency response or unit impulse response are presented with respect to practical implementation and use. The methods are separated into two categories: 1) A curve fit of only one degree of freedom with or without residuals. 2) A curve fit of multiple degrees of freedom with or without residuals. Particular details are given with respect to multiple degree of freedom techniques utilizing the Complex Exponential algorithm. 1979 SA E Transactions 790225. Light Duty Automotive Fuel Economy....Trends Through 1979. J. D. Murrell, U.S. Environmen- tal Protection Agency. The pre- 1975 EPA fuel economy data base has been expanded to over 6,600 cars, and these data on older cars have been adjusted for odometer mileage effects on fuel economy. The data base for model year 1975-1977 certification cars is also updated, reflecting actual sales figures. The resulting trend analyses are thus (for the first 47</page><page sequence="31">790226-790230 time) consistent from year to year with regard to the representation of actual sales weighted new-car fleet fuel economy. Data on the 1979 fleet is presented in detail, and compared with that of the 1978 fleet, on the basis of projected sales for those two years. Comparisons with pre-emission control MPG, which serve as measures of technological change accompanying increasing stringent emission standards, are accordingly revised from previous publications (1) on this subject. Passenger car size classes and interior volumes are treated in the trend sense, and also in a study of interactions between vehicle technology, fleet physical attributes, and post- 1979 fuel economy standards. 790226. Factors Influencing Automotive Fuel Demand. Barry McNutt, U.S. Dept. of Energy; Robert Dulla and David Lax, Energy and Environ- mental Analysis, Inc. Data were collected on alternative estimates of factors influencing fuel demand. These factors include: new vehicle registrations, vehicle miles of travel, vehicle scrappage and fuel economy. A methodology was then applied to assess the sensitivity of fuel demand to variations of each individual factor (within the range of the available data sources). A Base Case projection of fuel demand by vehicle type and fuel type is presented in detail. In addition, the impacts of two realistic alternative cases representing increased conservation efforts and increased fuel con- sumption are also analyzed. 790227. In-Service Fuel Economy. N. E. South and R. Raja, Environmental Research, Ford Motor Company. Ford Motor Company surveyed Ford management per- sonnel who drive Ford Motor Company lease vehicles. From the responses, in-use fuel economy data were computed on over 10,600 1978 model year cars. Analyses of the data are presented which include: fuel economy summary statistics; regressions of fuel economy ratings versus in-use fuel economy; measures of the ability of EPA ratings to rank in-use fuel economy; and the influence of car size class or transmission type on fuel economy regression and correlation. Wide ranges of fuel economies were found for each vehicle model type. The analysis shows no significant trend by car size class in the relationship between in-use fuel economy and metro highway fuel economy ratings. 790228. The Effect of Ambient Temperature Variation on Emissions and Fuel Economy - An Interim Report. R. S. Spindt, Gulf Science &amp; Technology Co.; and F. Peter Hutchins, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper summarizes the emission and fuel economy data obtained when ten dissimilar cars were run using the 75 Federal Test and the Highway Fuel Economy Test procedures. The soak and test temperatures used for the modified standard procedures varied from 0 to 110°F. The influence of the cars' air conditioners was also determined. The purpose of the program was to determine how well the emission control equipment designed to be effective at normal FTP test temperatures would work at temperatures ranging between 0 and 110°F. 790229. Effect of Cold Weather on Motor Vehicle Emis- sions and Fuel Consumption - II. Nicolas Ostrouchov, Mobile Sources Div., Environment Canada (Ottawa/Canada). The effect of soaking temperature on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption was investigated using a variety of automobiles representing different emission control levels including diesel engine powered vehicles. Tests were performed at soaking and ambient temperatures of 20°C down to -20°C (68°F to -4°F). It was found that emissions and fuel consumption are dependent on soaking temperature. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were higher at -20°C than at 20°C: hydrocarbon (HD), 1 to 4 times; carbon monoxide (CO), 1 over 3 times. The smallest increase of 1 to 1.04 times belonged to vehicles equipped with diesel engines. Nitrogen oxides (NOJ emissions were higher or lower at -20°C than at 20°C depending on emission control technologies -0.75 to 1.11 times. Analysis of the data has indicated that HC and CO emissions from the cold start phase of the Federal test were the most sensitive to soaking temperature. With NOx emissions the soaking temperature sensitivity was fairly constant throughout the three phases of the test. It appears that temperature sensitivity of fuel con- sumption in vehicles equipped with diesel engines and lean burn gasoline engines is considerably lower in comparison to the vehicles equipped with other control technologies, and is higher at -20°C than at 20°C: for diesel engines and lean burn -1.15 times; for other vehicles -1.55 times. The data also indicate that the temperature sensitivity of fuel consumption is a function of inertia weight. 790230. Impact of Emission Standards on Fuel Economy and Consumer Attributes. H. Oetting, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Germany). Volkswagen had a contract with DOT-TSC to generate a data base which would yield a consistent set of infor- mation about the factors affecting fuel economy of engines especially the impact of different emission standards and their influence on unregulated emissions and consumer attributes as well. Main important stan- dards were 0.41/3.4/ 1.0 and 0.41/3.4/0.4 gpm HC/CO/NOx. It was found that for setting engineering goals at least a factor of 0.5 was necessary regarding HC and CO, and a factor of 0.25 regarding NOx. The concepts 48</page><page sequence="32">790231-790237 achieving engineering goals mainly consistent of Volks- wagen engine families are described. All fuel economy, emissions, noise, startability, driveability, acceleration performance, and gradeability data obtained with these engine families are included. 790231. A Fuel Economy Development Vehicle with Electronic Programmed Engine Controls (EPEC). Bruce D. Lockhart, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. A vehicle has been built to incorporate a number of fuel economy improvement components with an Electronically Programmed Engine Control (EPEC) system. The vehicle system was optimized for fuel economy within driveability and emission constraints and provided a 12.5 percent improvement in fuel economy on the combined FTP tests. An evaluation of the fuel economy benefit of the combined system and individual components is presented. 790232. Identification, Quantification and Reduction of Sources of Variability in Vehicle Emissions and Fuel Economy Measurements. Narendra J. Sheth and Timothy I. Rice, Test Operations and Engineering Services, Ford Motor Company. A major problem in Vehicle Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Economy Testing has been the variability in the meas- urements. An extensive test program was undertaken to identify and quantify the sources of variation. The test program was designed using four test vehicles on five CTE-50 Clayton Dynamometer cells whereby four repeats for each combination were provided for a total of 80 CVS-C/H Emissions and F.E. Tests. During each test a total of 23 test variables were monitored and recorded in real time. Nine other variables were also observed for a total of 32 variables: 5 vehicle related variables, 16 engine related, 4 dynamometer variables, 3 driver related, and 4 environment variables. The paper reports various results of this experiment and describes an instrumentation package that was developed for "on-line" data recording. A brief discussion of the software used for "off-line" processing of the voluminous data as well as several statistical analysis techniques which were developed especially for identi- fying and quantifying the sources of variation, are included. The benefits which result from reduced test variability, namely lower test cost because of improved test efficiency and increased confidence in results, are pointed out. 790233. Emission and Fuel Economy Measurement Im- provements. W. W. Wiers, G. W. Niepoth and T. D. Hostetter, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. A program was initiated to improve the emission and fuel economy measurement accuracy and test cell to test cell correlation. Improvements were made to the Constant Volume Sampling System, electric dynamometer, instru- ment calibration ranges and system checks were initiated to improve the accuracy of the bag emissions, modal emissions, calculated and measured fuel economy. Unique emission and fuel economy problems associated with gasoline and diesel testing were studied and resolutions effected when possible. 790234. Introduction to Microprocessors. Gene H. Miller, Electrical Engrg., General Motors Inst., Flint, MI. Mechanical and automotive engineers cannot escape the impact of the microprocessor. Fortunately, the micro- processor and its related parts can be well understood without an extensive knowledge of electronics. The functions of the parts of a microcomputer and their interactions are presented. The microprocessor, clock, memory, and input/output section are defined and discussed. The relationship of binary and hexadecimal numbers to machine language and assembly language programming is made clear. This information will enable the engineer to better understand papers, presentations, and sales literature related to microcomputers. 1979 SA E Transactions 790235. Interfacing to the Microprocessor. Gene H. Miller, Electrical Engrg., General Motors Inst., Flint, MI. The microprocessor is only one component of a larger system called a microcomputer. The microcomputer is a component used to control a larger system, product, or instrument. Information is transferred between these various parts and systems via interfacing devices. The function of these devices and interfaces and the nature of the information transferred are described. 1979 SA E Transactions 790236. Microprocessor Selection and Software Design. Jim Wilson and Paul A. Wintz, Wintek Corp., Lafayette, IN. The objective of this paper is to list some of the parameters involved in choosing a microprocessor for a particular application and to discuss some of the inter- relationships between these parameters. The most impor- tant parameters are those depending on the application such as the number of inputs, number of outputs, required throughput, type of interfaces, and the total number of systems to be produced. Another set of parameters is microprocessor dependent such as the instruction set, throughput, and hardware and software support. Finally, parameters related to in-house hardware and software expertise must be considered. 790237. Designing Reliable Software for Automotive Applications. Barry Yarkoni and John Wharton, Intel Corp. The use of microcomputers in automotive applications has placed new requirements on programmers. Programmers 49</page><page sequence="33">790238-790243 must protect their software against flaws in the hardware system in which it is operating. Various techniques for writing "fail-safe software" have been developed, and are discussed in this paper. 1979 SA E Transactions 790238. Custom MOS for the Automotive Market. Dennis Morris, National Semiconductor Corp., Santa Clara, CA. Custom MOS has been around since the late 60's when it was used extensively by the military and some farseeing calculator manufacturers. In fact, custom MOS caused the calculator revolution and the development of micro- processors. The 8080 was an evolution from a custom processor. Custom MOS is a synergism between the end product developer and the semiconductor technologist. It is a semiconductor product that is designed for a specific need. As a consequence, it is the most efficient and cost effective answer to that need. However, when you also take development time, development costs, and manu- facturing guidelines into account, another solution may be more sensible. Custom MOS is anything from a simple sound generator to a complex engine control computer system. Custom MOS is not limited to a single chip system. It may be a multi-chip system with a mixing of standard components. Techniques can be used to reduce system costs by efficient usage of interconnect. What are the constraints in building a custom circuit? 790239. Standardize or Customize? Why Not Do Both. Jerry A. Michnal, Motorola Inc., Austin, TX. The "microprocessor revolution" is continuing to be propelled along by advancements in process technology. The process advancements are allowing greater device densities, which in turn are permitting increased func- tional integration. The microprocessors of yesterday are giving way to the microcomputers of today. The microcomputers are considered to be the inte- gration of a "System" on a "chip" of silicon. They contain mask programmed ROM, RAM, a timer, external inter- rupt hardware, on board clock oscillator and program- mable Input/Output lines. Some are expandable to include off-chip memory and peripherals. To take the "revolution" one step further, a new microcomputer has been created to accomplish further levels of integration for unique control situations. The need to interface with the control environment and its impact on custom integration is the prime consideration for the architecture of the Motorola MC6805 single chip microcomputer. The 6805 is designed to help bridge the gap of design time and investment capital that exists between standard microprocessors and custom designed controllers. 790240. Custom Bipolar Integrated Circuits for Auto- motive Application. William Maxwell, Sprague Electric Co., Worcester, MA. A manager's overview of how to use bipolar integrated circuits (ICs) for a custom approach to an automotive system application. After selecting the IC technology and establishing the application specifications, the project will follow a basic development cycle. The schedule of events that take place are basic to all custom bipolar ICs for automotive applications. The cycle starts with selection of semiconductor supplier and ends with a reliable, cost effective, custom bipolar IC in production - several months later. Reaching a successful conclusion requires considerable positive interaction between system manager and semiconductor supplier. 790241. Automotive ICs - They Work. Robert L. Luce, National Semiconductor Corp. Automotive Integrated Circuits can and will work. Making them work will require substantial commitment on the part of both semiconductor and automotive industries. While there is no choice today but to continue individual part stress - testing to remove potentially defective devices, developing standardized reliability test requirements will make comparative analysis straght- forward and minimize testing costs. The importance of minimizing costs may only be overshadowed by reliability, both of which may overwhelm new processes or designs in the future. 790242. Automotive Engine Modeling with a Hybrid Random Choice Method. Gary A. Sod, Dept. of Mathematics, North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC. A numerical procedure was introduced for solving one-dimensional equations of gas dynamics for a cylin- drical^ or spherically symmetric flow. This method has been generalized to the two dimensional equations of gas dynamics in a cylindrical geometry. This is coupled at the boundary with a grid free method (where the compu- tational elements are segments of vortex sheets) for approximating boundary layers on a flat plate and in a cylinder. Examples are given for flow in a motored engine chamber during intake and compression strokes. 790243. Numerical Simulation of the Exhaust Flow From a Single Cylinder of a Two Cycle Engine. G. A. Walter and Milt Chapman, Systems, Science and Software. The problem of exhaust flow from a high speed two-cycle engine is investigated for a specific exhaust pipe geometry. The attempt is to simulate accurately the ramming and scavenging effects of the pressure waves at the exhaust port in the cylinder of such an engine, over a range of engine speeds. Using a one-dimensional, compressible, inviscid fluid model, the GODEL hydrodynamic com- puter code developed by Chapman is employed to accomplish the simulation. Two differencing schemes are 50</page><page sequence="34">790244-790249 examined and compared. Further, we discuss briefly the implications of our results as regards (i) the applicability of certain solution algorithms to the particular problem; and (ii) the future of employing such numerical techniques to the analysis of exhaust and other internal combustion engine flows. 790244. Two Dimensional Numerical Simulation of Inlet Manifold Flow in a Four Cylinder Internal Combustion Engine. Milt Chapman, Systems, Science and Software, La Jolla, CA. An important problem in the inlet tract dynamics of four-cycle, four cylinder IC engines is the cylinder to cylinder variation in the air-fuel ratio. In particular, the inlet runner geometry and the valve timing over the wide range of engine speeds encountered may have profound effects on the charge delivered to a particular cylinder. Using a two-dimensional compressible, hydrodynamic model, we present results from flow field calculations performed with the DELTA computer algorithm. Our aim is to assess the feasibility of using such techniques on inlet manifold design. 790245. Nonisenthalpic Interaction of a Planar Premixed Laminar Flame with a Parallel End Wall. G. F. Carrier, F. E. Fendell, W. B. Bush and P. S. Feldman, TRW Defense and Space Systems Group, Redondo Beach, CA. The unsteady one-dimensional interaction of a planar flame, propagating through a fuel-lean premixture, with a parallel impervious noncatalytic wall is modeled as a Stefan-type problem incorporating one-step chemistry. Quantitative details concerning retardation of flame speed near an isothermal wall (pertinent to current cooled engines), and concerning acceleration of flame speed near an adiabatic wall (pertinent to proposed engines), are obtained. The time history of unburned hydrocarbon content varies with dimensionless Arrhenius activation energy, the order of the reaction chemistry, and the Lewis-Semenov number. Both temporally varying pres- sure, and also nonuniform fuel stratification, are dis- cussed. 790246. Microprocessor Software Design Technologies for Automotive Application. K. N. Rao, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Waterloo, Iowa. This paper presents, in tutorial fashion, an introduction to basic software design philosophy as it has evolved from an art into a science. Basic concepts of "structured" software design are presented for developing software in an industrial environment with high reliability, ease of understanding, and ease of maintenance. Several software design techniques, including structured analysis charts and HIPO charts, are described. The relative merits of these techniques are presented. "Top down" testing and efficient integration methods are described. Design veri- fication aids to improve software reliability, including "structured" programming are described. A systems approach towards software design throughout software life cycle is presented. Particular emphasis is laid on software documentation and maintenance. A systematic way of designing software is emphasized. 790247. Further Comparisons of Computed and Measured Divided-Chamber Engine Combustion. S. A. Syed and F. V. Bracco, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ. Combustion in a divided-chamber, stratified-charge en- gine is considered and flame and pressure results obtained with a two-dimensional, unsteady model are compared with corresponding engine data. The model is applied to eight engine conditions differing in speed, load and size of the prechamber orifice. The model employs one overall chemical reaction rate, the k-e representation of turbu- lence, and a wall heat loss proportional to the heat release. The computed results are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental ones in spite of the complexity of the problem and the early stages of detailed model validation studies. They are also shown to compare somewhat better than earlier ones obtained with an ad-hoc jet turbulence model. Both studies prove the importance of the prechamber jet to the overall combus- tion process for the particular engine investigated. Since divided chamber configurations are considerably more complex than open chamber ones, the model should be applicable to a variety of engine designs. Current and past experience indicates the model should be particularly useful in combustion optimization studies, during engine development, as a means to interpret and extrapolate engine test data. 790248. Fuel Motion and Pollutant Formation in Strat- ified Charge Combustion. Charles K. Westbrook, Lawrence Livermore Lab., Univ. of California, Livermore, CA. The concept of charge stratification is examined, using a numerical model for fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics. Initially homogeneous and stratified charge cases are discussed and compared, and simplified global rate expressions for the chemical reactions are compared with a detailed reaction mechanism. Results computed for the stratified models indicate that the fuel can be completely burned before it reaches the walls of the combustion chamber, effectively eliminating wall quenching as a source of unburned hydrocarbon emissions. However, volume flame quenching appears to result in unacceptably large amounts of unburned fuel in the stratified models. 790249. A Critique of the Theory for Gussac's "LAG Process" Engine. John R. Creighton, Univ. of California, Lawrence Livermore Lab., Livermore, CA. The theory of the LAG process is examined, especially the 51</page><page sequence="35">790250-790256 claim that radicals resulting from rich combustion in the pre-chamber reduce the induction time in the main chamber resulting in more rapid combustion. Recent calculations are presented which show that flame prop- agation is dominated by diffusion of radicals which eliminates any induction time. Additional radicals from the pre-chamber would be superfluous. Assuming more rapid combustion in an actual engine, as Gussac claims, tentative alternate explanations are given. The Appendix reviews and extends Semenov's theory of branching chain reactions. It is shown that buildup of radical concen- trations governs the induction period, and that the rate of fuel consumption is determined by the steady state radical concentration. 790250. Origin and Status of the DoE Heat Exchanger Technology Program to Improve Energy Con- version Efficiency. W. Thielbahr, U.S. Naval Weapons Center; and M. Perlsweig, U.S. De- partment of Energy. In 1976, the Office of Conservation of ERDA sponsored a survey to identify deficiencies in heat exchanger tech- nology affecting the timely development, demonstration and commercialization of advanced energy recovery and conversion systems of interest to Conservation. Heat exchanger deficiencies identified in this survey have been grouped into four categories: (1) performance and reliability penalties inflicted by the heat exchanger environment (i.e., those fluids in contact with the heat exchanger); (2) design and construction of efficient/re- liable high temperature heat exchangers (material tem- peratures exceeding 1800°F); (3) poor economics in recovering low grade waste heat; (4) lack of information on the long-term performance and reliability of newly developed heat exchangers. The Heat Exchanger Tech- nology (HET) Program was created in 1976 in response to these needs. Today, the HET Program resides within the Office of Fossil Energy Technology of the Department of Energy. Although certain HET projects relate directly to coal technology needs, the primary thrust of this program is, as it was originally, conservation oriented. This paper will (a) discuss the origin and objectives of the HET Program, (b) describe projects comprising the HET Program, (c) present a status report on current activities. 790253. Cast Densified Silicon Carbides. J. W. Lucek, M. L. Torti, G. Q. Weaver and B. A. Olson, Norton Co., Worcester, MA. Recent interest in high performance silicon carbide components has spurred the development of advanced fabrication technology. This development, coupled with properties and current volume production capability make densified silicon carbides a readily available advanced ceramic to heat engine designers. 790254. Development of the Reradiant Recuperator. C. J. Mameli, Industrial Energy Conservation Re- search, Inst, of Gas Technology. This paper presents the background and development of the reradiant concept for the radiant stack type recuper- ator. It also presents the results of an ongoing demon- stration program of this concept. IGT developed the concept of the reradiant recuper- ator which increases the effectiveness of conventional radiant recuperators by 5-15% depending on unit size. This paper discusses the mathematical model developed by IGT which optimized the application of a metal leaf type insert within the hot gases passing through a conventional radiant recuperator. The metal leaf insert is designed to maximize radiation to the annulus wall. This increase in heat transfer is not due to increased convective heat exchange, as when a "core buster" insert is used, but strictly due to radiation from the leaf insert. Data on a prototype unit operated by IGT to verify the mathematical model will be presented and explained. Data collected from the present ongoing demonstration program (i.e., reradiant recuperators installed on indus- trial furnaces) will provide current data on the program. 790255. Ceramic Materials Selection for a Glass Furnace Recuperator. Dean V. Power, Terra Tek, Inc. Procedures, materials and results are reported for the materials selection process performed in conjunction with efforts to develop, test, and evaluate High Temperature Range Recuperator designs for an industrial glass furnace. Potential materials were evaluated on material properties, fabrication capability, and relative performance in the flue environment of a day tank glass furnace. Polycrystalline alumina (Vistai), reaction sintered silicon carbide (KT and NC 430), chemically vapor deposited silicon carbide (CVD) and Sintered Alpha silicon carbide proved most satisfactory in the material temperature range of 2300° F to 2800° F. Relatively pure alumina (AD 998 and AD 94), mullite and cordierite were most satisfactory in the material temperature range of 1700° F to 2300° F. Thermo-mechanical stress for each material was calcu- lated under expected operating conditions for the optimized design. Material strengths are shown to be greater than calculated stresses by factors ranging from 2.6 for KT silicon carbide to 16 for cordierite. Recuper- ator test sections were subjected to twice the expected thermal stress conditions with no evidence of failure. A test section was also subjected to the thermal shock of instant transfer between room temperature and a 2000° F furnace without damage. 1979 SA E Transactions 790256. High Temperature Recuperation for Steel Mill Soaking Pits. Frank G. Rinker and Patrick O. Benner, Technical Center-Capital Goods, Mid- land-Ross Corp. A new system has been proposed for the recuperation of waste heat energy in steel mill soaking pit furnaces. The new system offers efficiency increases from 130% to 360% 52</page><page sequence="36">790258-790262 above conventional recuperation systems. This is possible through the combination of a low leakage, compact ceramic recuperator and a highly efficient, low cost metallic unit. Included in the advanced design is a newly developed ultra high temperature preheated air multi-fuel burner and an improved system for air/fuel ratio and temperature control. 790258. Accident Avoidance Characteristics of Unconven- tional Motorcycle Configurations. Robert Schwarz, South Coast Technology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA. This paper presents the results of a program investigating the potential of unconventional motorcycle configurations for improved accident avoidance performance. Stability and obstacle avoidance characteristics were investigated analytically using mathematical models of both the uncontrolled and rider-controlled motorcycle. An analysis was also performed of the sensitivity of the optimum front-rear brake proportioning to road surface conditions and lateral acceleration. The results indicate that a low center of gravity, long wheelbase configuration has advantages in the moderate-to-high speed regime in terms of the margin of safety in performing an obstacle avoidance maneuver, and rider skill level required in braking. These advantages accrue at the expense of low speed maneuverability and controllability, and weight and overall complexity of the machine. 1979 SA E Transactions 790259. Effect of Main Factors on Dynamic Properties of Motorcycle Tires. Hideo Sakai, Osamu Kanaya and Hiromi Iijima, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc. (JARI). Dynamic properties of motorcycles are, to a great extent, governed by motorcycle tire properties. In this study, the influences of various factors such as internal pressure, load, tire make, width, etc., on tire dynamic properties are clarified through the experiments carried out on labo- ratory testing machines. It was found that tire dynamic properties are significantly influenced by these factors, and the experiments yielded some beneficial data for the improvement of motorcycle dynamic properties as well as tire dynamic properties. 1979 SA E Transactions 790260. Moped Directional Dynamics and Handling Qualities. John W. Zellner and David H. Weir, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. Analytical results describing moped lateral-directional response properties are presented. Design characteristics of four example mopeds related to directional handling are presented and compared with sample motorcycle properties. Resultant moped dynamics are quantified and compared. Using a nominal moped example, the sensi- tivity of the vehicle dynamics to operational and design variables, such as speed, loading and tire properties, is shown. Implications for rider/moped handling are re- viewed. 1979 SA E Transactions 790261. Simulation of Off-Road Motorcycle Ride Dy- namics. Stephen H. Black, General Electric Co., Schenectady, NY; and Dean L. Taylor, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY. The dynamic ride response of a motorcycle was inves- tigated using a four-degree-of-freedom computer simu- lation (bounce, pitch, and movement of each wheel). The simulation is nonlinear in terms of both geometry and suspension components, and is generally applicable to any type of motorcycle of reasonably standard configuration. It was developed in the context of application to off-road motorcycles and special problems associated with simu- lating off-road motorcycles are discussed. Results indicate that the dynamic response is strongly nonlinear with wheel liftoff and suspension bump stops as the two major sources of nonlinearity. 1979 SA E Transactions 790262. Motorcyclists' Visual Scanning Pattern in Com- parison with Automobile Drivers'. Yasuhisa Nagayama, Takanobu Mori ta and Toshiaki Miura, Dept. of Traffic Psychology, Osaka Univ.; Junichi Watanabem and Nobuo Murakami, Kawasaki Heavy Industry. Motorcyclists' visual behavior was examined and com- pared with that of drivers' by an eye-marker method. The background of this research is as follows. From the accident statistics of Osaka prefecture, characteristics of motorcycle accidents and those of ordinary passenger cars were analysed and compared and it was revealed that collisions on turning right (in the United States, collisions on turning left) are most remarkable. In this case, collisions between motorcycles running straight ahead and automobiles turning right are most typical. The auto- mobile drivers expected that the motorcyclists would give way. But, almost without braking, the motorcycles crashed into the automobiles turning right. Here, one of the problems is motorcyclists' unawareness of existence of automobiles turning right. We focused upon this. Three males participated as subjects in these exper- iments with an eye-marker. Independent variables were type of vehicle and speed. The results are as follows. (1) The proportion of the road surface which was recorded on film through an eye-marker is much larger in riding motorcycles than in driving an automobile. Motorcyclists' head is tilted forward. It follows that they are apt to be looking at the closer road surface more frequently. (2) From the result of distribution of fixation points, it is suggested that motorcyclists are mainly acquiring infor- mation from the closer road surface, whereas automobile drivers are mainly acquiring information from distant foreground. (3) In riding motorcycles, the vertical variance of visual field and fixation points is larger. This suggests 53</page><page sequence="37">790264-790270 that motorcyclists are trying to acquire information from both the closer road surface and the distant foreground. (4) Mean fixation duration of motorcyclists is shorter than that of automobile drivers. This suggests that they are acquiring and identifying information relatively super- ficially. These findings would throw light on motorcyclists' failure to detect vehicles turning right, oncoming vehicles, crossing vehicles and pedestrians. We stress that educa- tion for road users should involve these findings and that more appropriate road conditions for stable riding should be realized. 1979 SA E Transactions 790264. Product Liability and the Motorcycle Designer. Jon S. McKibben, McKibben Engrg., Inc. Recent changes in product liability law, and in magnitude of jury awards, dictate that engineers shift their design priorities. Motorcycle designers must consider the liability implications of design improvements and re-evaluate traditional concepts of cost-effectiveness analysis. Explo- sive escalation of product liability litigation demands serious consideration by the designer at the concept stage and throughout final hardware development. 790265. Experimental Study on Motorcycle Steering Performance. Akira Aoki, Japan Automobile Research Inst., Inc. (Japan). A study of the lateral motion of motorcycles has been conducted through experiments on four large motorcycles of Japanese manufacture. A total of five experimental procedures were applied to straight or nearly straight running conditions and curve running conditions, and the results of each experiment were arranged by frequency response function in terms of input and output. Consideration is given to steer torque and rider lean angle as independent control inputs, and both single-input and dual-input analysis were conducted. This analysis revealed that the major determining input force is steer torque, and that the rider lean angle by itself has almost no influence on output. 1979 SA E Transactions 790266. Experimental Investigation of the Transient Be- havior of Motorcycles. David H. Weir and John W. Zellner, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. Analytical and experimental studies of the transient and oscillatory behavior of motorcycles are reported. Three example vehicles were used. The effects of adding load, changing operating conditions, and modifying the vehicle configuration are shown. The phenomenon known as cornering weave is illustrated and interpreted. 1979 SA E Transactions 790267. (P-80) A New Measuring Method for the Direct Determination of Diesel Engine Combustion Noise. F. F. Pischinger, K. P. Schmillen and F. W. Leipold, Institute of Applied Thermody- namics, Technical University Aachen, Daimler- Benz AG, Stuttgart. Previously indirect test methods were used to investigate Diesel engine combustion noise. Now digital signal analysis gives the possibility of determining it and its narrow band spectra directly. Such a method for direct evaluation of the combustion noise is described and the possibilities offered by it are shown. A single-cylinder direct-injection Diesel serves as a test engine. Steady-state as well as transient conditions of the engine are evaluated by the procedure. 1979 SA E Transactions 790268. (P-80) Reducing Diesel Knock by Means of Exhaust Gas Recirculation. H. Oetting and S. Papez, Volks wagen werk AG. The different impacts on Diesel knock were investigated. The main parameters were fuel quality, ambient and engine temperature, quantity of fuel injected, compression ratio, and injection timing. One of the most reasonable methods to decrease cold knock is exhaust gas recircu- lation (EGR). The mechanism of the EGR effect was explained and the limitations of Diesel application of EGR was estimated. 1979 SA E Transactions 790269. (P-80) DI Diesel Engine Becomes Noisier at Acceleration - The Transient Noise Characteris- tic of Diesel Engine. Yoshito Watanabe, Hideaki Fujisaki and Toyohiro Tsuda, Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd., Ageo, Saitama, Japan. An acceleration mode in measuring vehicle pass-by noise was simulated on an engine test bed in an anechoic room. The accelerated running noise of various types of diesel engines was measured and compared with the steady running noise. The measurement results show that naturally aspirated DI engines become noisier at accel- eration, while IDI engines change only slightly. In turbocharged DI engines, the response lag of the turbo- charger causes an especially big noise level difference immediately after acceleration start. This paper deals also with the mechanisms of higher level of accelerated running noise in DI engines. 790270. (P-80) Relation Between Combustion System and Engine Noise. D. Anderton, I.S.V.R., Uni- versity of Southampton. From measured overall I.C. engine noise levels and corresponding measured combustion (cylinder pressure) levels the paper illustrates the major influence that the combustion system has on the engine radiated noise. The basic 'noisiness' of normally aspirated and turbocharged two- and four-stroke D.I. systems, normally aspirated I.D.I, (swirl chamber) diesel and gasoline systems are compared by a normalised frequency spectrum method. 54</page><page sequence="38">790271-790278 Using a simple linear model for calculating the direct combustion noise level of each combustion system the relative levels of noise are calculated. The results show good agreement with measured noise levels for normally aspirated two-stroke and four-stroke D.I. engines and indicate that combustion noise is low in turbocharged diesels, I.D.I, diesels and particularly gasoline engines. 1979 SA E Transactions 790271. (P-80) Establishing a Target for Control of Diesel Combustion Noise. M. F. Russell, Lucas Indus- tries Noise Centre, Lucas CAV Limited, London, England; and E. J. Cavanagh, Lucas CAV Research Department, Lucas CAV Limited, London, England. The minimum practicable levels of diesel combustion noise and mechanical noise, which might be achieved by control at source, are estimated for direct injection engines of 1 litre per cylinder capacity, as used in trucks and tractors of European manufacture. These levels are compared with targets derived from proposals for more stringent noise legislation for such vehicles. The targets might be achieved by a combination of control of combustion and mechanical noise at source and reduction of the engine structure response to these sources. 790272. (P-80) Piston Movement and Its Influence on Noise of Automotive Engines. W. Sander, W. Steidle and E. Wacker, Karl Schmidt GmbH, Neckarsulm (Germany, W.). This paper compares the calculated and measured piston transverse movement in a spark ignition engine. The induction of engine vibrations by the piston slap is studied by measuring the lateral forces at the piston skirt during the impact on the cylinder. The application of a piston movement computer program for piston development is demonstrated in the case of engine noise due to piston top land slap. The pressure differences in the main combus- tion chamber of an IDI-diesel engine are measured, and the effect on the piston attitude is analysed. Examples of low-noise piston design for diesel engines are presented. 790273. (P-80) The Influence of Mountings on Injection Pump Noise. M. F. Russell, Lucas Industries Noise Centre, Lucas CAV Limited, Acton; and H. L. Pullen, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Southampton University. As new designs of diesel engine, which emit less noise, are evolved to meet increasingly stringent noise legislation, noise from diesel fuel injection equipment could become a significant proportion of the total noise from the engine. Quieter fuel injection pumps are being produced for such engines by Lucas CAV, however their potential will not be realised unless special care is taken in the design of pump drive and mounting brackets. Impacts from the sudden take-up of backlash in the drive to the pump, and vibration of the engine surfaces to which the pump is secured, can increase pump-radiated noise considerably. 1979 SA E Transactions 790274. (P-80) A Coherence Model for Piston-Impact Generated Noise. P. A. Hayes, Cummins Engine Co., Columbus, Indiana; A. F. Seybert, Dept. of Mech. Eng., Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky; and J. F. Hamilton, Dept. of Mech. Eng., Purdue University, W. Lafayette, Indiana. An experimental study was conducted to investigate piston-impact generated noise in diesel engines. A coher- ence model was used to represent the noise generating mechanisms, of the engine. The model was applied to an in-line turbo-charged diesel engine. Frequency response functions were measured between the cylinder liner vibration and the engine noise, and between the combus- tion pressure and the engine noise. The noise coherent with piston impacts was separated from the noise coherent with combustion. Guidelines are presented showing how the results of the coherence model may be used for engine design and noise prediction. 790277. Computer Aided Design Package for Diesel Engine Manifold System. S. C. Low, R. S. Benson and D. E. Winterbone, Univ. of Manchester, Inst, of Science and Technology (Manchester/United Kingdom). An interactive computer program for predicting the performance of a total engine system is described. The facilities include the basic design of the valve time-area diagrams, starting from various cam profiles, wave action effects in inlet and exhaust manifolds and turbocharger matching. The program is accessed via visual display units (VDUs) and its interactive nature takes many activities from the realm of the research department into that of the design department. The results obtained from the program are validated by comparison with a well-known more sophisticated wave action program. 790278. The Role of the Computer in Turbocharger Design Development and Testing. M. S. Khan and P. J. Langdon, Holset Engrg. Co., Ltd. (England). The design process of turbocharger impellers is recursive, involving several iterations in aerodynamics and stress analysis before finalised drawings may be produced. A comprehensive interface to both forms of analysis is discussed which relieves the designer of tedious data preparation, providing graphical interaction throughout. This interaction has been extended to the production of NC tool paths for die making and prototype manu- facture and the data base created by the design procedure can be accessed for casting inspection. Finally, use is made of real time data acquisition from test cells to feed the latest empirical data into the design process. 55</page><page sequence="39">790279-790290 790279. Crankshaft Design Using a Generalized Finite Element Model. Terry M. Shaw and Ira B. Richter, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. An analytical tool for the efficient analysis of crankshaft designs has been developed. Finite element models are generated from a limited number of key dimensions which describe a family of crankshafts. These models have been verified by stress and deflection measurements on several crankshaft throws. 790281. Dual Phase Steel Production Bumpers. Harvey H. L. Mantey and Fred T. Burton, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. The use of HSLA dual phase steel is an effective method of reducing bumper weight while meeting ever increasing government performance requirements. A paper analysis, followed by a hardware evaluation, successfully substi- tuted "dual phase" for conventional HSLA steel at a reduced thickness. Bumpers for the all-new 1979 Cadillac Eldorado were designed and released using dual phase steel with yield strengths of 70-80 ksi for the face bars. Production problems were overcome by modification of mechanical properties and increased development expe- rience with this steel. To achieve the full work-hardening potential of dual phase steel, bumper sections and draw dies must be designed for a uniform strain greater than three percent. Future dual phase steel for bumpers in the 80-120 ksi range is desirable, but further improvements in steel- making technology and part and die design techniques are required to achieve this goal. 1979 SA E Transactions 790283. Risk Analysis of an Automated Assembly Line Operation. David A. Hulburt and Larry R. Albaugh, Hercules Aerospace Div., Hercules Inc., Allegany Ballistics Lab., Cumberland, MD. Risk Analysis is a powerful technique for quantifying the risk associated with a process or product, and determining the cost/benefit tradeoffs within the system for managing risk. The application of Risk Analysis to the automotive industry is illustrated using an actual case history. The risk involved was damage to equipment and/or product due to failures within the system. The Risk Analysis identified the elements of the system which were responsible for the high frequency of damage failures the client was expe- riencing. Corrective action on these elements substantially reduced the occurrence of damage failures. In addition, the analysis predicted an unacceptable level of control system failures - subsequently confirmed by operating experience. No reasonable-cost remedies were identified by the analysis. Alternate control system strategies are in the process of being evaluated. The case history illustrates the applicability and benefits of Risk Analysis to auto- motive industry operations in general. 790284. Risk Analysis in Maintainable Designs. H. J. Bajaría, Lawrence Institute of Technology, Southfield, MI; and Gregory Gruska, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. In the past few years, there has been an increasing utilization of risk analyses of reliability and safety considerations in the design and management decision processes. Management decisions, however, are contin- gent on matters other than the strictly technical. A primary business objective is to gain the customers' acceptance by satisfying the criteria of product availa- bility. This can be attained by providing highly reliable and/or easily maintainable products. These can be two different design philosophical approaches. In the design philosophy where a highly maintainable design is the best alternative, risk analysis becomes an important tool in assessing the risk of "down time" as well as the risk associated with maintenance actions. This paper will discuss the twin aspects of availability and maintainability and their impact on management decisions. A practical example is given. 790289. Metabolic Heat Retention and the Vehicle Op- erator. Edmund J. Glassford, Consultant, San Diego, CA; and Esar Shvartz, Consultant, Long Beach, CA. Heat stress and metabolic heat retention is known to be a major contributing factor to discomfort, fatigue, reduced visual acuity, and performance decrements. Trim mate- rials and other constituents of the seating devices have been studied to determine their effect on heat dissipation. Forty-five trim cover materials, sixteen trim pads, and five foam cushion pads were studied for impedance to body heat loss by evaporation, conduction, convection, and radiation. The range of heat flux through the various materials ranged from 6.5 BTU/FTVHR to 35 BTU/FTVHR. The minimum desirable heat flux value of 24 BTU/FTVHR was established. The relationship of metabolic heat retention to physiological variations that can affect overall performance were discussed. 1979 SA E Transactions 790290. Comparison of Model Calculations and Exper- imental Measurements of the Bulk Cylinder Flow Processes in a Motored PROCO Engine. G. C. Davis and J. C. Kent, Ford Motor Company. A PROCO Flow Simulation (PFSIM) model has been developed to calculate the angular velocity (swirl) and radial velocity (squish) as a function of crank angle for the four strokes of the motored engine cycle. In addition, the PFSIM model calculates the time dependent cylinder pressure, temperature and mass. The model accepts the following swirl-related parameters as input: dimensionless angular momentum and mass flow coefficients for a specific intake and exhaust system configuration. These parameters determine the intake-generated swirl which is computed from the angular momentum flux entering the cylinder during the induction process. An angular mo- 56</page><page sequence="40">790291-790299 mentum flux swirl meter was used to obtain the required input data for three different intake port configurations, and calculations of the bulk cylinder flow were carried out with PFSIM for each intake port configuration. Exper- imental measurements of in-cylinder swirl were obtained with the spark discharge/time-of-flight method in a motored PROCO research engine for the same three intake ports. Good agreement was found between meas- ured and calculated swirl velocities. The importance of angular momentum dissipation within the cylinder is indicated by the results of this investigation. In further model calculations, the sensitivity of swirl and squish to changes in piston geometry has been shown. 790291. Development and Use of a Cycle Simulation to Predict SI Engine Efficiency and NOx Emissions. J. B. Heywood, J. M. Higgins and P. A. Watts, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and R. J. Tabaczynski, Engi- neering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A computer simulation of the four-stroke spark-ignition engine cycle has been developed for studies of the effects of variations in engine design and operating parameters on engine performance, efficiency and NO emissions. The simulation computes the flows into and out of the engine, calculates the changes in thermodynamic properties and composition of the unburned and burned gas mixtures within the cylinder through the engine cycle due to work, heat and mass transfers, and follows the kinetics of NO formation and decomposition in the burned gas. The combustion process is specified as an input to the program through use of a normalized rate of mass burning profile. From this information, the simulation computes engine power, fuel consumption and NO emissions. Predictions made with the simulation have been compared with data from a single-cylinder CFR engine over a range of equivalence ratios, spark-timings and compression ratios. Predicted fuel consumption and NO emissions showed acceptable quantitative agreement with the data. A parametric study of the effect of variations in load, speed, combustion duration, timing, equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recycle and compression ratio was then carried out for a 5.7 / displacement engine. Pairs of parameters were selected for analysis, and variations in brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific NO emissions and mean exhaust temperature were deter- mined. 790293. Model for Nitric-Oxide Formation in a Large- Bore Spark Gas Engine. R. P. Wilson, Jr., A. A. Fowle and W. J. Raymond, Arthur D. Little, Inc.; and W. J. McLean, Cornell Univ. Several characteristics distinguish the combustion in large-bore engines from ordinary automotive engines; namely low rpm and associated long combustion dura- tion, natural gas fuel, multiple spark plugs, lean ($ « 0.8) operation, substantial unmixedness due to direct gas injection during compression, and low surface to volume ratio. In order to better appreciate the effects of these factors on NOx formation, a phenomenological model of combustion in a 20-inch bore two-cycle natural gas engine is described. The model accounts for random "unmixed- ness" of the initial charge, stratification, and temperature gradients arising from successively burned zones. Predic- tions are compared with experimental data for the effects of variations in timing, fuel-air ratio, stratified charge, EGR, and turbulence. 790297. Vehicle Aggressivlty Measurement and Evalua- tion. Carl Ragland, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation. This paper presents some current methods of evaluating vehicle aggressivity. Current methods under development include the use of a honeycomb front impact barrier which measures loads across the vehicle frontal area. Analytical methods are also available to model a com- bination of vehicles in frontal collisions and the associated occupant responses. In addition, a theoretical method is presented to measure aggressivity. The new methodology also uses a deformable barrier in frontal impact testing. This barrier, however, is modeled to represent a non- aggressive vehicle, used as a standard against which aggressivity characteristics of all cars can be measured. 790298. Roadway - Driver Compatibility. George W. Brown, Transportation Consultant, The An- chorage, Solon, I A; and Brent O. Bair, Trans- portation Planning Coordinator, Oakland Coun- ty Road Commission, MI. The safety of a motor vehicle transport system requires examination of the total system to assure its compatibility with human behavior capability. A lack of time available for driver decision and response to unexpected hazards as well as traffic control directives is a critical deficiency present in roadway operations. 790299. Effect of Changing Automobile Materials on the Junk Car of the Future. L. R. Mahoney, J. Braslaw and J. J. Harwood, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Annual projections of the amounts of metallic and non-metallic materials available for resource recovery from the average junk car in the time period 1974 through 1995 are presented. The amounts and the composition of the ferrous and non-ferrous metals and the non-metallic material derived from the recycling of junk cars will undergo large changes in the future due to the material changes adopted in the manufacture of current and future automobiles. Implications important to the recycling industry due to these changes are identified and related research and development programs which need address- ing are discussed. 57</page><page sequence="41">790300-790308 790300. Maximizing the Life Cycle of Plastics. W. Lincoln Hawkins, Plastics Institute of America. A unique approach has been initiated to involve several universities in a coordinated research effort. Research faculty at selected universities, where research interests relate to major problems of concern to the plastics industry, have been formed into a research team. Their individual research efforts are being coordinated by the Plastics Institute of America. Through constant surveil- lance by the Institute's Board of Trustees, research objectives are directly related to the needs of industry.

Laman, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This review primarily covers scrap tire disposal processes used, or suggested for use, in the U.S.A. Sufficient statistical data are presented to define the magnitude of the scrap tire disposal problem. The constraints of an ideal solution are presented as a basis for a critical review of current and proposed scrap tire disposal procedures. Our conclusion is that no one scrap tire disposal procedure is so outstanding as to be used exclusively to handle the problem. Geographic location and economics will dictate which scrap tire disposal procedure will be used. 790304. AM General/M.A.N. Articulated Bus. G. W. Scharbach, AM General Corp.; and H. Domandi, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N uernberg Ak tiengesellschaf t . AM General and the main producer of articulated buses in Europe, M.A.N., have jointly introduced this type of bus to the U.S. market. The bus was modified from its originally European configuration to comply with all U.S. regulations and specific customer requirements. Description of the bus and its components are presented in detail emphasizing the specific aspects of an articulated bus - the underfloor drive train, articulation joint and braking system. The structure, electrical system, interior and air- conditioning system are also outlined. 790305. Improvement of Citybus Fuel Economy Using a Hydraulic Hybrid Propulsion System - A Theo- retical and Experimental Study. P. Buchwald, G. Christensen, H. Larsen and P. Sunn Pedersen, Technical Univ. of Denmark, Laboratory for Energetics. The paper describes the application of a hydraulic pump/motor and a hydro-pneumatic energy-storage as a supplement to the conventional internal combustion engine in a city bus. The resultant hybrid-system makes it possible to smooth out the combustion engine power output and to regenerate the braking-energy which in conventional busses dissipate as heat. Computer-simulation and supplementary experiments with a model-system have shown that, depending on the driving pattern of the bus, this type of hybrid-system would lead to a 10-30% fuel saving provided that an appropriate control strategy is used. 1979 SA E Transactions 790306. Catalyst Systems with an Emphasis on Three- Way Conversion and Novel Concepts. Polat öser, Volks wagen werk AG. The effects accruing from the choice of precious metals and their relative ratios are considered in catalyst systems used in VW and Audi cars under open loop conditions and dynamic closed loop controlled engine conditions in conjunction with an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. The best catalyst system for three-way activity found when com- paring major manufacturer technologies was the system Pt/Rh = 5:1 which is introduced in two 1979 engine families sold in California, VW microbus and Audi 5000. This paper discusses also the interrelationship between window and sensor characteristic and novel emission control concepts including metal supported catalysts and catalysed exhaust pipes for the improvement of warm-up. 1979 SA E Transactions 790307. A Study of Thermal Energy Conservation in Exhaust Pipes. Gerald F. Robertson, General Motors Research Laboratories. The emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon mon- oxide (CO) from a vehicle can be decreased by obtaining faster warmup of the catalytic converter. An experimental study of the consequences of effectively internally insu- lating an exhaust pipe has demonstrated (1) a significant increase in converter-inlet gas temperature during warmup, and (2) a lowering of HC and CO emissions on the Federal Test Procedure by about 15% on one particular vehicle. A mathematical model has been developed and verified to predict converter-inlet tem- perature histories from known exhaust-takedown tem- perature histories and to quantify the effects of various insulation material properties on the temperature of the gas entering the converter. The dangers of drawing misleading conclusions from tests of exhaust pipe insu- lation are discussed. 790308. Experimental Analysis on Exhaust Gas Temper- ature of Various Four Cycle Gasoline Engines. K. Goto, M. Yamada, T. Hirayama, K. Saito and N. Tokoro, Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. This paper discusses the relation between the exhaust gas temperature and the engine parameters. The engine speed, load, spark timing, air fuel ratio and exhaust gas recirculation ratio were chosen for the calibration parameters, and the compression ratio, valve 58</page><page sequence="42">790309-790313 overlap timing, engine displacement, the number of cylinders and others were chosen for the design param- eters. A series of tests were done on six different engines. The data were analyzed statistically and the experimental equation was derived with which the exhaust gas tem- perature can be estimated. The paper includes the process of the analysis and some application of it. 790309. Heat Transfer in the Straight Section of an Exhaust Port of a Spark Ignition Engine. G. L. Malchow, S. C. Sorenson and R. O. Buckius, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL. An experimental system has been constructed to study the heat transfer processes in the straight section of the exhaust port of a four-stroke, spark ignition engine. The effects of engine variables on the steady-state heat transfer rates have been studied at four locations in the exhaust port. It was found that the heat transfer rates have a significant dependence upon the location within the exhaust port. Data have been correlated in the form of a Nusselt-Reynolds number relationship for local and spatially averaged steady-state heat transfer. It has been shown that the use of conventional steady-state heat transfer relationships for developing steady-state turbu- lent flow in pipes predicts heat transfer rates which are lower than those experimentally observed. 790310. Interior Noise Reduction in a Recreational Van. E. J. O'Keefe, Specialty Composites Corp. A study was made to determine the effect of combinations of acoustic treatments on the interior noise levels in a 3/4 ton van. The effect of barriers, absorbers and vibration dampers in various combinations on the dBA levels are given for both idle and highway operating conditions. A noise reduction of up to 10 dBA was obtained for certain barrier and absorber combinations. 790311. (SP-442) Turbocharging Small Displacement Spark Ignition Engines for Improved Fuel Econ- omy. K.-D. Emmenthal, G. Hagermann and W.-H. Hucho, Volkswagenwerk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). This paper describes an approach to improve the fuel economy of given cars with the aid of turbocharged SI engines of relatively small displacement, 1.6-1 4-cylinder and 2.2-1 5-cylinder configurations, to replace bigger, NA engines of the same power potential. This approach uses an engine turbocharger system which consists of a low-flow turbocharger in order to realize a given peak performance goal with good power characteristics over the entire engine-speed range. The boost pressure is controlled by a wastegate. The air/fuel mixture is prepared by a two-stage carburetor at the intake side of the TC compressor. The oxygen concen- tration in the exhaust gas is measured by an oxygen sensor upstream from a three-way catalyst. 790312. Turbocharging Forďs 23 Liter Spark Ignition Engine. H. H. Dertian, G. W. Holiday and G. W. Sanburn, Ford Motor Company. Ford's new 2.3 Litre 1-4 Turbocharged Engine and Powertrain was specifically developed to match the new 1979 Mustang/Capri. This engine/vehicle combination was developed to provide the customer excellent vehicle performance, good fuel economy and driveability. Extensive vehicle and dynamometer work was done to match the turbocharger to the engine and optimize in-vehicle mid-range to high end performance. The relatively high compression ratio (9.0: 1) was retained from the naturally aspirated engine to preserve low end manual transmission vehicle performance before turbocharger boost. Revisions to basic engine components and struc- tures to insure durability will be discussed. 790313. (SP-442) Installation and Design Problems As- sociated with the Automotive Turbocharger. Kenneth F. Kaiser, Charles R. Sarle and Bruce R. Owen, Schwitzer, Wallace Murray Corp., Indianapolis, IN. The projected high volume use of turbochargers on automobiles has presented the designer with two for- midable problems - cost and mounting flexibility. The cost of an automotive turbocharger has to be less than that of a comparable unit for a diesel engine - without any sacrifice in reliability. In order to maintain the cost, the manu- facturer is forced into designing one basic unit to be used in numerous applications. Therefore, the successful marketing of an automotive turbocharger will depend very heavily upon the mounting versatility designed into the basic unit. The design of the Schwitzer S6 automotive turbo- charger was initiated with severe economic guidelines and mounting versatility being paramount in the design philosophy. In order to meet the design goals, a number of unique items had to be considered and incorporated into the turbocharger. The current design can be mounted from within four degrees of horizontal to within ten degrees of vertical. The bearing housing is sandwiched between the compressor end flange plate and the turbine housing with retention by three cross bolts located at 120 degree intervals. This arrangement allows the gravity oil drain to be rotated within the intervals between the bolts. The bearing system was simplified by using a free floating non-rotatable sleeve bearing with axial thrust capability to replace the Schwitzer rotating journal with a separate thrust bearing. The wastegate system is comprised of a rotary valve actuated by a remote boost-controlled spring-loaded diaphragm. The rotary valve concept allows the turbine to be bypassed to avoid any increase in the engine back pressure as a result of the presence of the turbocharger at high cruising speeds. The rotary valve also 59</page><page sequence="43">790314-790321 has the advantage of a positive self-cleaning feature and minimizes the close tolerance machining compared to a more conventional pop-off valve arrangement. The con- trol mechanism for the wastegate is located remote from the turbine housing which allows the use of less expensive parts since they do not have to endure a hot corrosive environment. The relative merits of carburetor pressur- ization versus suction will also be discussed. 790314. (SP-442) Turbocharging Four-Cycle Diesel En- gines. Patrick F. Flynn, Cummins Engine Co. The interaction of turbocharger characteristics with engine design and performance parameters is presented. Turbocharger matching requires a compromise among the following variables: combustion air-fuel ratio, turbo- charger characteristics, peak cylinder pressures, engine speed range capability, transient response, and overall package efficiency. The mechanisms of interactions of the above variables are reviewed to highlight the turbocharged engine designers problems. The impact of turbocharger performance limits on overall engine characteristics is reviewed with special attention focused on what limi- tations point out as the turbomachinery designers' job for the future. 1979 SA E Transactions 790315. (SP-442) Turbocharger Compressor Performance Evaluation and Critical Flow Field Measure- ments. David Japikse and Jay Goebel, Creare Inc., Hanover, NH. A detailed study of two commercial turbocharger com- pressor impellers with a parallel wall vaneless diffuser is reported. The study shows that present turbocharger compressor maps from different sources cannot be reliably compared as random errors can amount to ± 0.05 (5 points) on efficiency (20:1 odds). Vaneless diffuser traverses reveal a flow field with backflow and separated regions. The quantitative traverse results reveal the level of uncertainty existent today in such basic deduced parameters as slip factor, backflow loss, rotor efficiency and diffuser recovery. A fully bladed and cutback bladed impeller are compared. Further work is outlined. 1979 SA E Transactions 790316. (SP-442) Exhaust Emissions from a European Light Duty Turbocharged Diesel. C. Bassoli and G. M. Cornetti, FIAT Research Centre (Turin/ Italy); G. Biaggini, IVECO Engrg. (Turin/Italy); and A. Di Lorenzo, Combustion Research Lab. C.N.R. (Naples/Italy). The impact of turbocharging on Diesel exhaust emissions has been investigated by studying, on a 4-cyl IDI Fiat engine different configurations including fuel injection optimization, exhaust gas recirculation and oxidant catalysts. The experimental results obtained during bench and chassis dynamometer tests were compared with the same tests performed on the naturally aspirated 4-cyl engine. Mathematical models were used in order to identify the regions giving the maximum contribution to regulated emissions. Particulate and organic absorbed compounds were also measured. It appears that turbo- charging can represent a reasonably good approach in order to achieve low levels of regulated emissions and particulates associated with high fuel economy. 1979 SA E Transactions 790317. Computerized Prediction of Physiological Re- sponses to Work Environments. Stephan Konz, Dept. of Industrial Engrg., Kansas State Univ. A computer program has been developed which predicts an individual's physiological responses to various com- binations of environment and exercise. The user enters information concerning the individual (height, weight, age, etc.), the environment (dry bulb temperature, air velocity, etc.), the task (sit, walk, metabolic rate, etc.) and the simulation (for 50 min, output every 10, etc.). The program then predicts body temperatures, heart rate, sweat rate, comfort, etc. and prints it out at the desired times. An important feature of the program is that variables can change during the simulation. For example, the task can change from sit to walk, the temperature from 30 C to 45 C, etc. The article gives an overview of the program and compares predictions vs data for some situations. 1979 SA E Transactions 790320. Child Restraints in Cars - An Approach to Safe Family Transportation. Hans Norin, Eva Saretok, Kjell Jonasson, Àke Andersson, Bengt Kjellberg and Sture Samuelsson, Volvo Car Corp., Product Development and Engineering. Four comprehensive surveys dealing with child safety problems in cars have been carried out at AB Volvo in Sweden. Results concerning injury frequency and severity and different types of injuries are discussed with respect to which mode children travel as car occupants. On the basis of this experience, we recommend how children of different ages should travel as passengers in cars. Our general recommendation is that children should never travel unrestrained. 790321. Advanced Restraint System Concepts. W. Reidelbach and H. Scholz, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart/Germany). The seat belt pretensioner designed to eliminate belt slack in lap/shoulder belt systems with emergency locking retractors, is described as well as the current Mercedes- Benz passive restraint system which consists of air bags deployed by means of solid propellant gas generators, knee bolsters, and an electronic crash sensor with dual level triggering function. Combinations of lap/shoulder belts, air bags, and pretensioners are presented and lead to the conclusion 60</page><page sequence="44">790322-790327 that an optimal restraint system would not be in compliance with current regulations. 790322. Factors Influencing Knee Restraint. Clyde C. Culver and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. A planar mathematical model was developed to provide means of studying factors which can influence the function of lower torso restraint via a padded lower instrument panel or knee bolster. The following factors were judged to play the most significant role: 1) initial fore-and-aft position of the seated occupant relative to the knee restraint; 2) location of the knee-to-bolster contact; 3) angular orientation of the bolster face; 4) primary axis of the bolster resisting force; 5) variations in vehicle crash parameters (e.g., toepan rotation and displacement and seat deflection); and 6) deformation characteristics of the bolster. The model of a seated occupant included radiographic and empirical data on the anatomy of the links and joints in the lower extremity. Emphasis was also placed on determining a range of reference location, orientation and primary axis of resistance of the knee bolster so that an effective restraint may be provided for the 5th percentile female, 50th percentile male, and 95th percentile male occupant. 1979 SA E Transactions 790323. Effectiveness of Current and Future Restraint Systems in Fatal and Serious Injury Automobile Crashes. Data from On-Scene Field Accident Investigations. Donald F. Huelke, Univ. of Michigan Medical School; and Harold W. Sherman, Michael J. Murphy, Richard J. Kaplan and Jerry D. Flora, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univ. of Michigan. Data from 101 front seat automobile occupant fatality crashes that the authors had investigated were reviewed along with 70 front seat automobile occupants who had the more severe (AIS 3, 4, or 5) level injuries who did not die. The effectiveness of the lap belt alone, lap-shoulder belt, air bag alone, air bag with lap belt, and the passive shoulder belt were made. The estimates reveal that none of the restraints would have prevented 42 to 51 of the fatalities. The air bag with lap belt, and the lap-shoulder belt system, have the highest effectiveness for reducing fatalities (AB + LB, 34%; LB -I- SH, 32%). The air bag with lap belt has an effectiveness of 68% in reducing the more serious injuries with the lap-shoulder belt nearly as equal (64%). NHTSA's fatality reduction estimates are exces- sively high and overly optimistic compared to ours, but theirs are noticeably lower for serious injury reduction than are ours. Comparisons with other restraint effec- tiveness studies are also made. 790324. High and Low Rate Force-Deformation Char- acteristics of Motorcycle Helmets. Herbert B. Kingsbury and Wayne C. Herrick, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE; and Dinesh Mohan, Research Dept., Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Washington, DC. The load-displacement characteristics of fifteen motor- cycle helmets were determined at displacement rates from quasi-static to 5M/S. Seven of these helmets had poly- carbonate outer shells while the remaining shells were of fiberglass construction. The stiffness of helmets with polycarbonate shells was found to be more uniform, both with loading rate and magnitude of load, than that of fiberglass shell helmets. Use of these data to predict helmeted head force and acceleration after impact with a rigid surface is illustrated using a mathematical model. 790325. Occupant Protection in a Research Safety Vehi- cle. G. J. Fabian, Advanced Technology Center, Calspan Corp., Buffalo, NY. The protection afforded the occupants of the Research Safety Vehicle (RSV) being developed for NHTSA by Calspan and Chrysler is identified by giving examples of the results of staged collisions. A brief review of the objectives of the four phase RSV program, vehicle development, and ultimate goals is provided as a frame of reference for the discussion of crashworthiness. Test data and photographs obtained in front, side and rear end collisions of these cars indicate occupant survivability in the 40 to 50 mph range. 790326. Volkswagen Passive Occupant Protection System Progress Report - 1979. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Re- search and Development, Volkswagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/W. Germany). This paper describes the most recent test results and field experience of the VW Passive Restraint System (VWRA). Laboratory test results indicate that the addition of a lap belt to the VWRA does not improve the system's performance in respect to anthrophomorphic test data. Furthermore, there was no detectable difference in side impact when the VWRA was compared with the active lap shoulder belt system. Finally, an update of accidents involving the VWRA are presented, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in actual use. 1979 SA E Transactions 790327* Initial Comparison of Single Cylinder Stirling Engine Computer Model Predictions with Test Results. Roy C. Tew, Jr., Lanny G. Thieme and David Miao, National Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. A Stirling engine digital computer model developed at NASA Lewis Research Center has beeri configured to predict the performance of the GPU-3 single-cylinder rhombic drive engine. Revisions to the basic equations and assumptions previously reported on are discussed. Initial comparisons of the model predictions with the early 61</page><page sequence="45">790328-790339 results of the Lewis Research Center GPU-3 tests are made. 790328. An Air/Fuel Control System for the Stirling Engine. James E. Fenton, Ford Motor Co. A repeatable air/fuel control system has been developed for the Stirling engine. This control system provides a wide range of metered fuel flows and adjustable air/fuel ratios, a requirement for mapping and optimization of Stirling engine components which placed limitations on conventional fuel metering systems. 790329. The Stirling Engine for the Automotive Appli- cation. K. Rosenqvist and T. Lia, United Stirling of Sweden; and B. Goldwater, Mechanical Technology Inc. Both kinematic and free-piston Stirling engine technology is currently under development and, although the fun- damentals are the same, each configuration demands unique engineering that is applied to the specific appli- cation. This paper discusses the current technology as it applies to the automotive application being addressed at United Stirling of Sweden and Mechanical Technology Incorporated in their respective Stirling engine fields. 790331. Soft Fascia Concept for 1979 Mustang/Capri Design and Manufacturing Considerations. L. W. Moriarty and R. E. England, Ford Motor Company. A number of design and manufacturing requirements were considered in the development and application of a large, complex, RIM produced soft fascia for the 1979 Mustang and Capri front ends. The design and manu- facturing process had to be closely coordinated to achieve the fit, functional and appearance objectives of this highly styled one piece soft part. The successful application of the 1979 Mustang and Capri soft flexible fascia demonstrates that the design and manufacturing capabilities exist and that the fascia concept will be a viable product/design consideration for future applications. 790333. Design and Manufacturing Guidelines for Ultra High Strength Steel Bumper Reinforcement Beams. B. S. Levy, Inland Steel Co. The weight of a bumper system with a plastic fascia is significantly affected by the weight of the bumper reinforcement beam. This paper addresses the design and manufacture of ultra high strength steel bumper rein- forcements, and provides an example of a proven design. It is shown that light gauge, ultra high strength steel bumper reinforcement beams can, in some cases, be an economically effective way to save weight. 1979 SA E Transactions 790334. Bumper Energy Attenuators Made From Fiber Reinforced Plastic. Malcolm K. McDougall, Joseph N. Epel and Robert E. Wilkinson, The Budd Company, The Plastic Research and Development Center, Troy, Michigan. A family of weight saving bumper energy management devices has been developed from continuous fiberglass composites which are able to replace the hydraulic impact attenuators currently used between the bumper and the structure of automobiles. Variously shaped moldings have shown the capability to pass the impact test requirements facing the passenger car market in the United States as posed by FMVSS 581. Among the more efficient units are those making use of the buckling column phenomena such as the "Y Column" and "Sigma Column" bumper energy attenuators. 1979 SA E Transactions 790335. 1979 Firebird - An Advanced (Part 581) Soft Bumper System. J. V. Scrivo, Davidson Rubber Co., Inc. Weight and performance characteristics of the 1979 Pontiac Firebird soft bumper system are compared to those for a typical new (1979) metal/hydraulic design to evaluate the effects of the new standard. This study demonstrates the changing competitive environment in the automotive bumper market due to the introduction of the Part 581 Standard. The deep soft bumper concept is also discussed including its potential for achieving weight reductions in future elastomeric bumper systems. 790338. Custom CMOS Approach to Automotive In- strumentation. C. A. Stascausky and E. C. MacDonald, Stewart Warner Electronics. The paper will deal mainly with custom C-MOS ap- proaches to most measurement and warning signal needs of the automobile. It will cover considerations for selection of a technology, possible circuit approaches for system design needs, characteristics of the technologies and variations to be expected with environmental changes. It will consider device and building block characteristics of the technologies along with their variations and discuss environmental protection such as input protection techniques for electrical transients and temperature excursion. Original design custom circuits will be discussed. 1979 SA E Transactions 790339. Ford Speed Control Utilizes I2L Technology. L. N. Benoit, S. A. Leszczyński and R. R. Pilkington, Vehicle Controls Engrg., Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A new Ford Speed Control Amplifier has been designed using an I2L custom Integrated Circuit (IC) which was independently designed by multiple vendors from func- tional block diagrams, which included definition of all external components and characterization of all inputs and outputs. The IC's contain both analog and digital 62</page><page sequence="46">790341-790351 functions on a single substate. The designs have resulted in a speed control amplifier providing more features, reduced package size, and lower warranty return projec- tions than the previous design. 790341. Application of Electronic Systems at Ford. H. C. MacDonald, Engrg. and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The microcomputer technology has been improving rapidly in terms of processing power, cost, size and reliability. It has now become cost effective in the automobile and its applications within the automotive manufacturing system have been rapidly increasing. This paper discusses some advanced concepts for automotive controls. It explains how the speed and power of the chip computer is utilized for real time integrated controls and how loops are closed for adaptive controls. The worrisome question of how the service industry will handle these new controls is addressed with emphasis on the computer's ability to diagnose its own control systems. Finally, the rapidly spreading use of microprocessors in the auto- motive manufacturing plants is described, and the re- sulting opportunities in mass production functional control are indicated. 790342. A Single Chip Microcomputer with System Features. Richard A. Nedbal, American Micro- systems, Inc. A new microcomputer family has been designed with the intent of minimizing system parts count by integrating typical system requirements "on chip." The tendency toward over specialization has been avoided by increasing the microcomputer family members to allow system upgrading with minimum overkill. The S2000 micro- computer family is an example of next generation low cost single chip microcomputers designed with system appli- cations in mind. 790343. Techniques for Applying Single Chip Micro- computers to Automotive Problems. Dean A. Bennett, Fairchild Camera and Instrument Sem- iconductor Div. The single-chip microcomputer is very appropriate for automotive control applications. Selecting a product, designing with it, and moving it into production needs to be carefully planned to avoid unexpected costs and delays. Included, as an appendix, is a glossary of buzz words, used to describe single-chip microcomputers. 790346. Troubles and Countermeasures on Oil Seals for Automotive Application. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Masamichi Oh taki and Hiroo Tanoue, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK-USA, Inc. (U.S.A.). In order to improve the reliability of oil seals in practical use, it is considered that further basic investigation for maintaining good sealing characteristics of seals are necessary. However, the result of analysing phenomena in oil seals which has caused the oil leakage in the market shows that about 60% of oil leakage is caused by the seal installation to housing bore or shaft, about 30% thereof by unsuitable operating condition and remaining 10% by the design of oil seals. From the point, oil leakage troubles and their countermeasures on oil seals for automotive application are discussed. 790349. RTV Silicone Rubber Formed-In-Place Gaskets. William H. Clark, Technical Service &amp; Devel- opment, Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI. RTV silicone formed-in-place gaskets are used throughout industry as a replacement for preformed cork, paper, and rubber gaskets. The RTV silicone rubbers offer a unique property, performance and cost profile that make them ideally suited for formed-in-place gasketing applications. The concept is rather simple. A thin bead of paste consistency RTV silicone is applied to one of two mating surfaces. When assembled the RTV silicone flows between them filling all voids and irregularities. The gasket cures to a solid silicone rubber gasket that has excellent flexibility, thermal stability and fluid resistance. 790350. A Study of Lubrication Characteristics on Valve Stem Seals for Automobile Engines. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Yoshio Kawahara and Yoshitaka Muto, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Susumu lida, NOK-USA, Inc. (U.S.A.). Valve stem seals are important to control consumption of lubricating oil for engines and to prevent an air pollution problem by unclean exhaust. It is required for valve stem seals to have stable characteristics of a controlled oil leakage related to frictional characteristics. In this paper, the concept of designing valve stem seals which possess the above characteristics have been dis- cussed by applying an inverse problem of hydrodynamic lubrication. 1979 SA E Transactions 790351. A Comparative Evaluation of Square VS Round Cross-Section Circular Seals Using Stress Re- laxation Data to Predict the Useful Life of a Seal. R. D. Robbins, Goshen Rubber Co., Inc., Goshen, IN. Nitrile, silicone and fluorocarbon polymers were evalu- ated in square and round cross-section rings using stress relaxation to determine retained sealing force under static conditions at elevated temperatures. Stress-relaxation data were combined with a stress-decay formulation to predict the life of the seals while examining the effect that squeeze, cross-sectional shape, and state of cure have on performance. Regardless of material used, square cross-section rings exert a greater sealing force than their round counterparts 63</page><page sequence="47">790352-790356 for a longer time period. This improvement in seal life is due to cross-sectional shape and state of cure. 790352. Extending the Capabilities of the Radial Lip Shaft Seal. Dean R. Bainard and Douglas A. Cather, Garlock Precision Seal, Oil Seal Div., Colt Industries, Gastonia, NC. The application of a bonded-in P.T.F.E. bearing material liner to the lip of an oil seal has dramatically increased the seal's ability to function in high-speed, pressure, or heavily-contaminated applications. This has resulted in relatively inexpensive solutions to several difficult sealing problems. 790353. Characterization of One- and Two-Dimensional Homogeneous Combustion Phenomena in a Con- stant Volume Bomb. T. Michal Dyer, Sandia Labs., Livermore, CA. A combustion bomb has been used to compile a comprehensive set of well-characterized experiments which may be used to validate computer models of IC engine combustion. Extensive variations of experimental conditions allow the kinetics and fluid mechanics in the codes to be independently evaluated. Thermodynamic properties of the swirling, uniform precombustion mixture are characterized by measuring pressure, temperature distribution (with thermocouple probes), velocity/turbu- lence (with laser Doppler velocimetry) and equivalence ratio. Combustion diagnostics include pressure histories, high-speed laser shadograph filming, flame position determined with a laser refraction technique, and time- and space-resolved density using laser Rayleigh scattering. 1979 SA E Transactions 790354. Mathematical Modeling of Combustion Process in a Spark-Ignition Engine. Trilochan Singh, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI; and Kosol Surakomol, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. One-dimensional unsteady analysis of turbulent flame propagation has been used to determine the heat release rate. This model considers the combustion chamber geometry, piston face profile and spark plug location. The chemical kinetic analysis has been used to predict NO emission level as function of time and chamber position. Equilibrium calculation of CO emission level at the end of combustion process has been performed. A computer program has been developed to solve the flame propa- gation and kinetic equation. The results have been verified by comparing the experimental data such as flame velocity, combustion duration, mass fraction of burned gas versus crank angle, rate of pressure rise and emission levels of NO and CO with those predicted by the model. It was observed that the predicted results agree fairly well with the currently available experimental results at all tested conditions (various rpm and spark timings for 0% EGR and wide open throttle condition) for the whole range of A/F variation from lean to rich limits. A parametric study has been performed to investigate the effects of spark plug locations on combustion duration, flame velocity and emission levels of NO and CO. Based on a parametric study and a comparison of theory, and experiment, it was observed that the flame speeds reach a maximum value as the air-fuel ratio is approximately 10% richer than the stoichiometric ratio and decrease at higher or lower air-fuel ratios. The flame speeds of the engines with concentric spark plug locations are faster than the engines with eccentric spark plug location. Nitrogen oxide levels reach a maximum value as the air-fuel ratio is approximately 10% leaner than the stoichiometric ratio and decrease at higher or lower air-fuel ratios. Carbon monoxide level shows a decreasing trend with increasing air-fuel ratio, leveling off to a minimum value at approximately 0.85 equivalence ratio. It is anticipated that the model will be useful for design studies directed toward improving the efficiency and pollution characteristics of internal combustion engines. 790355. A One-Dimensional Combustion Model for a Dual Chamber Stratified Charge Spark Ignition Engine. S. C. Sorenson and S. S. Pan, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL. A model has been developed for simulating the combus- tion in a three-valve stratified charge spark ignition engine. The conservation equations for mass, momentum, chemical species, and energy are numerically integrated for a one-dimensional flame using an empirical model for turbulent diffusivity. The chemical reaction of the fuel and air is modeled using simple kinetics in a one-step reaction and experimentally determined ignition delays are used. Nitric oxide emissions are calculated using a simple Zeldovich model with steady state atomic nitrogen and equilibrium atomic oxygen. Effects of various as- sumptions and parameters in the model are discussed and comparisons with experimental data from a single- cylinder engine are presented. 790356. Numerical Prediction of Axisymmetric Laminar and Turbulent Flows in Motored, Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines. J. I. Ramos, J. A. C. Humphrey and W. A. Sirignano, Guggenheim Labs., Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton NJ. The flowfield in a motored axisymmetric reciprocating internal combustion engine is calculated as a function of space and time throughout the complete four stroke cycle, by means of a computational procedure which solves the governing partial differential equations on a mesh which expands and contracts with the motion of the piston, using an implicit, iterative, finite-difference scheme. Numerical results are presented for laminar and turbulent conditions. In the last case, two additional conservation equations, the kinetic energy of turbulence and its dissipation rate, are 64</page><page sequence="48">790357-790362 solved. In both cases, an axisymmetric configuration and a centrally-located valve, which opens and closes instan- taneously have been studied. The results corresponding to the laminar case show the formation of a large vortex during the intake stroke. As the fluid is compressed, the intensity of the vortex decays, and its decay persists throughout most of the expansion stroke. The turbulent case results show that the turbulence is clearly generated during the intake stroke due to the shear layers on the sides of the incoming air jet and is then convected and diffused through the cylinder. 1979 SA E Transactions 790357. Rapid Distortion Theory Applied to Turbulent Combustion. Victor W. Wong and David P. Hoult, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Massachu- setts Inst, of Technology. A technique of calculating the evolution of turbulence during the combustion phase of a reciprocating engine cycle is presented. The method is based on a local linearization of the full non-linear equations of motion. It is valid when the turbulence is distorted more rapidly by the changes in mean flows than it interacts with itself. The theory requires as input strain rates of the deterministic mean motion, and the initial state of turbulence. Calculations are presented for the particular case of a cylindrical chamber geometry. In the burning process it is assumed that the spark plug is located on the cylinder axis and the strain field is that established by the flame front. The theory calculates the turbulence parameters during the combustion period. Calculations were done using various theories of combustion that provide a relationship between the turbulent flame speed and the turbulence parameters. Comparisons are made between the theory and available experimental data and show reasonable agreement. 1979 SA E Transactions 790359. Prediction of Gas Exchange Processes in a Single Cylinder Internal Combustion Engine. P. A. Lakshminarayanan, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Technology (Loughborough/ England); P. A. Janakiraman, Dept. of Electrical Engrg., Indian Inst, of Technology (Madras/ India); M. K. Gajendra Babu, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., Indian Inst, of Technology (Delhi/India); and B. S. Murthy, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA. The study of unsteady gas exchange processes in the intake and exhaust systems of an internal combustion engine is presented in this paper. A finite difference scheme is used for solving the equations defining these systems. The transient properties like the pressure, temperature and velocity in these systems are computed by the present scheme and are compared with the results obtained using the pressure measuring devices and an ultrasonic instrument which can simultaneously measure the gas temperature and velocity. 790360. (P-80) Modeling of Vibration Transmission in Engines to Achieve Noise Reduction. R. G. DeJong and J. E. Manning, Cambridge Collabo- rative, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The vibration transmission in engine structures has been studied to develop analytical models which predict changes in the noise related vibration of the engine as a function of design changes in the engine components. The models are based on vibration measurements made on nonrunning engines. This paper outlines the basic pro- cedures for the necessary vibration measurements and for the development of the models. Two examples are given of models developed for different vibration transmission paths in different engines. The vibration transmission from the cylinder pressure to the engine block is modeled for a 4 cylinder DI diesel engine and compared with a simulated vibration transmission measurement with the engine not running. The vibration transmission from the engine block to covers and shields is modeled for a 6 cylinder in-line diesel and compared with the measured vibration transmission with the engine running. 790361. (P-80) Vibration Mode Analysis for Controlling Noise Emission from Automotive Diesel Engine. Fujio Aoyama, Shinichi Tanaka and Yasuo Miura, Hino Motors, Ltd. (Japan). The vibration mode analysis of an automotive diesel engine for the purpose of obtaining a lower level of noise emission will be described in the paper. Since the noise emission corresponds to the vibration of certain components of the engine, the vibration of engine structure was analyzed in several running condi- tions. Vibration distribution shows a natural vibration mode which was proven by coincidence with the result obtained by modal analysis. When measurement of the vibration mode is very difficult due to the high mechanical impedance and especially the big damping factor of the component, a new method of vibration mode analysis for the engine component excited by cylinder pressure was proven to be useful. Some attempts for controlling the noise and an analysis of damping effects will also be described in the paper. 790362. (P-80) Modeling of Diesel Engine Noise Using Coherence. Malcolm J. Crocker and James F. Hamilton, Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. A diesel engine can be modeled as a multiple-input, single output system, sometimes known as a coherence model. Theoretical models for multi-input, single output 65</page><page sequence="49">790363-790367 systems are quite well developed, but only recently have attempts been made to apply these models to practical noise cases such as diesel engines. The results of these models can be used to predict changes in engine noise as cylinder pressure-time history is varied or to attempt to identify sources of noise in the engine. Practical diffi- culties arid simplifying assumptions which must be made are discussed. 1979 SA E Transactions 790363. (P-80) Transmission Noise Reduction Using Holographic Source Identification and Con- strained Layer Damping. Ronald W. Hera, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors. As the noise of various vehicle components is reduced, transmission noise will become more apparent. Most transmission noise is generated by vibration of the transmission housing caused in turn by meshing of gear teeth. To effectively reduce airborne noise emanating from the housing, the critical areas of the housing that act as speakers must be identified. A photographic technique using laser light, called Double-Pulsed Holography, has been adapted for this purpose. A five-step test program has been successfully completed and has resulted in a quieter prototype through use of constrained layer damping materials at critical points on the transmission housing. Thus, it is expected that holography will be a very useful tool in locating housing areas which are the source of airborne noise. 1979 SA E Transactions 790364. (P-80) Computer Optimised Design of Engine Structures for Low Noise. N. Lalor, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton, England. The paper describes a computer optimisation procedure, using static deflection techniques, by which the overall noise level of an engine can be reduced by up to 5dBA by minor modification. The computer program operates within given weight, space and strength constraints and produces a modified design which can be machined by existing plant. The use of the static deflection technique is justified by the results of running engine damping measurements and by the analysis of the influence of damping on typical third octave vibration levels. This analysis demonstrates that the damping of the block structure has very little influence on running engine vibration levels, which are, in fact, controlled by the stiffness. 1979 SA E Transactions 790365. (P-80) Relation Between Crankshaft Torsional Vibration and Engine Noise. Kazuomi Ochiai and Mitsuo Nakano, Research &amp; Engineering Division, Isuzu Motors Limited, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa-ken, Japan. This paper presents the results of the latest investigations carried out at Isuzu Motors Ltd. into the mechanism of radiated noise from an acoustically modified diesel engine. Although the overall noise level of this engine is quite low compared with those of conventional design because noise in the acoustically important range from 800 to 1250 Hz has already been sufficiently reduced by structure modification, predominant peaks appear at 315 Hz and at 1600 Hz third octave bands which now govern the overall noise. To achieve further reduction of engine noise, these two peaks have to be adequately reduced. Therefore the noise generating mechanisms at 315 Hz were studied in detail on the running engine as well as experimentally using modal analysis program and by theoretical analysis. This study revealed the relationship between the vibration behaviour of the crankcase and a torsional vibration of the crankshaft. Also presented are the result of a study into the means of reducing noise peak. 1979 SA E Transactions 790366. (P-80) Engine Noise Reduction by Structural Design Using Advanced Experimental and Finite Element Methods. Dean M. Ford, Numerical Analysis, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, Indiana; Paul A. Hayes and Stephen K. Smith, Noise Control Technology, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, Indiana. This paper presents structural analyses performed on an in-line, six cylinder diesel engine for noise reduction purposes. Both finite element modeling and experimental structural analysis using digital techniques were per- formed on the existing design. By applying both of these methods to the same structure, the accuracy of the structural model can be established. After several itera- tions the results of each method were made to agree quite closely. The finite element model could then be used for predicting the effect of design changes on the structural responsé of the block. 1979 SA E Transactions 790367. The Atlanta Rapid Transit Cars. Tom S. Taylor, Parsons Brinckerhoff/Tudor, Atlanta, GA. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is in the process of procuring cars. These cars are of welded aluminum extrusions, 75 feet long, and are powered by a chopper modulated 750 volt third rail propulsion system. Certain unique features are discussed in detail, including the method of body construction, reliability, noise levels, the cooling of propulsion equip- ment, and auxiliary voltage regulation. The test program is outlined and the significant results to date summarized. Most difficulties have been of a second order nature, but testing has taken longer than had been anticipated. A recommendation is made to provide more time for testing on future procurements, or to plan operations using other than new equipment. 66</page><page sequence="50">790370-790379 790370. State Air Quality Plan and the Modernization of Automotive Painting Facilities. Delbert Rector, Air Quality Div., Dept. of Natural Resources, State of Michigan. The automobile, directly and indirectly, is the major cause of air pollution in Michigan. While Michigan has made substantial progress in improving the pollution levels of particulates and sulfur dioxide (pollutants related to automobile production), we are just not taking aim at the control of volatile organic compounds which contribute to the formation of ozone, Michigan's most pervasive elevated air pollutant. Approximately 50% of all the VOC emissions in Michigan are attributable to stationary sources and the other 50% to mobile sources. The painting of automobiles and light duty trucks is a significant portion of the stationary source emissions. To reduce emissions from the motor vehicle painting facilities, Michigan has developed a unique regulatory approach which (1) requires implementation of all reasonable controls by 1982; (2) provides for substantial emission reduction during the period 1982-1987 through somewhat technology forcing requirements; and (3) accomplishes this on a schedule and with a price tag which the industry is prepared to meet. This paper summarizes the new requirements for GM, Ford and Chrysler painting facil- ities. 790374. Hydragas* Suspension. A. E. Moulton and A. Best, Moulton Developments Ltd.

Suspension Parameter Prediction Using Finite Element Analysis. William A. Cobb, General Motors Engineering Staff, General Motors Cor- poration. A technique has been developed for applying finite element computer models, assembled for vibration work, to analysis and prediction of vehicle handling perform- ance. The method facilitates the prediction of chassis stiffnesses important to handling before a vehicle is built and available for laboratory testing by more traditional methods. The technique incorporates the general purpose finite element computer program (NASTRAN), total vehicle system models developed for structural analysis, and applied loads intended to simulate an existing laboratory test. A post-processor program summarizes chassis parameters related to handling from the general NASTRAN displacements in familiar units. Example results from actual and simulated testing are compared. 1979 SA E Transactions 790377. Clinical Case Reviews of Light Truck and Van Crashes. Harold W. Sherman, Highway Safety Research Institute; and Donald F. Huelke, Univ. of Michigan Medical School. This paper reviews some clinical case studies taken from field investigations conducted by the authors of actual crashes involving light trucks and vans. An attempt is made to indicate where Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards might possibly be applicable and to compare cases where vehicle design changes apparently reduced the severity of injuries. In particular, cases are shown where occupants were restrained and where steering column energy absorbing and rearward displacement systems have been installed. 1979 SA E Transactions 790378. Recent Trends in Van and Small Truck Safety. James O'Day and Richard Kaplan, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. The dramatic increase in the use of pickup trucks and vans over the past few years raises some questions about the performance of these vehicles with regard to safety. This study, using data mainly from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), indicates that these vehicles are not demonstrably less safe than are passenger cars. There remain, however, some unresolved issues with regard to the patterns of use and the degree of protection that these vehicles offer their occupants. 790379. Personal Characteristics and Patterns of Vehicle Usage Among Van and Pick-Up Drivers in Michigan. Martin E. Lee, Research and Eval- uation Div., Michigan Dept. of State. A comprehensive analysis was undertaken of those who own and drive light vans, recreational vehicles and pickups, using an extensive disaggregate data set on the driving habits of motorists measured throughout Mich- igan during all of 1976. The data were derived from a survey conducted by the Michigan Department of State. Socioeconomic and household characteristics of all owners and users in the survey (up to about 1925 out of 7600 respondents) were examined, together with detailed descriptive statistics on the behavior of motorists actually using vans, recreational vehicles, or pickups on a desig- nated recent trip day. It was found that the users and owners of these vehicles generate more travel than any other private vehicle-user class, and that this may be related to socioeconomic and geographical factors. 67</page><page sequence="51">790380-790386 790380. The Methodology of Passenger Automobile Fuel Economy Rulemaking - Part I, Technology. Stephen Luchter, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Dept. of Transportation, Wash- ington, DC. Skeleton production plans are developed for several scenarios. Weight estimates are made of each "base level." Engines and transmissions are matched to the new weight, and a value of fuel economy, without other technological improvements, is determined. Fuel economy improve- ments due to other technological changes such as reduced aerodynamic drag, reduced tire rolling losses, the appli- cation of improved lubricants, etc., are added. Annual fuel economy estimates, by manufacturer, for each scenario, result. A brief review is included of the evolution of this methodology. 790381. The Methodology of Passenger Automobile Fuel Economy Rulemaking - Part II, Economics. Robert O. Reck, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Trans- portation, Washington, DC. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act requires that both technical feasibility and economic practicability be considered in establishing fuel economy standards for new motor vehicles. Economic efficiency considerations and the social welfare implications associated with fuel economy standard setting require that such technical and economic considerations be simultaneously evaluated. A method of performing this joint analysis is through the use of the principles of Social Welfare Theory combined with the computational method of Linear Programming. The result of the analysis provides estimates of fuel economy standards which are both technologically, economically, and socially efficient. 790383. Development of Pictographic Symbols for Vehicle Controls and Displays. Paul Greene, The Uni- versity of Michigan, Human Performance Cen- ter. Two experiments were conducted to develop symbols for seven automobile controls and displays (heater, air conditioner, fresh air vent, radio volume, radio tuning, exterior lamp failure, and tire pressure) and answer several related questions. In the first, 43 drivers drew pictures they thought should be used as symbols for the items in question. Based on their suggestions the author designed several candidate symbols for each function. In the second, 62 drivers rated how well each candidate's intended meaning was understood. For many functions a "best" symbol was found, often one which differed from that currently used by the automobile manufacturers. 790384. Driver Anthropometry and Vehicle Design Char- acteristics Related to Seat Positions Selected Under Driving and Non-Driving Conditions. Lawrence W. Schneider, Charles K. Anderson and Paul L. Olson, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A sample population of 51 male and 57 female subjects ranging in age from 18 to 78 years was assembled and tested in six different vehicles for preferred seat positions under non-driving and driving conditions. Volunteer subjects were selected by age, stature, and weight criteria in order to match the U.S. adult population to the extent practical. Preliminary analyses of these data suggest that on a total sample basis there is little difference between seat positions selected under non-driving and driving conditions, but that individuals may show significant differences. The small differences in group mean positions observed in this study may be due to a seat belt and/or an initial seat position factor. Post-drive seat position results were analyzed in a variety of ways to identify factors that may influence a person's preferred seat position. 1979 SA E Transactions 790385. The Influence of Vehicle Aerodynamic and Con- trol Response Characteristics on Driver-Vehicle Performance. Alexander A. Alexandridis and Brian S. Repa, Engrg. Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI; and Walter W. Wierwille, Virginia Polytechnic Inst, and State Univ., Blacksburg, VA. The effects of changes in understeer, control sensitivity, and location of the lateral aerodynamic center of pressure of a typical passenger vehicle on the driver's opinion and on the performance of the driver-vehicle system were studied in the moving-base driving simulator at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Twelve sub- jects with no prior experience on the simulator and no special driving skills performed regulation tasks in the presence of both random and step wind gusts. The lower weights and moments of inertia of future passenger vehicles can be expected to change the effect of wind gusts making the evaluation of aerodynamic and control response characteristics on closed-loop wind disturbance regulation a matter of increased interest. 1979 SA E Transactions 790386. Lower Specific Fuel Consumption with High Compression Lean Burn Spark Ignited 4 Stroke Engines. Michael G. May, Antipollution Indus- trial Research S.A. General aspects to improve the thermal efficiency of four stroke spark ignited internal combustion engines. Lean air-to-fuel ratios and high compression ratios call for a revised combustion chamber shape. One practical simple and cheap concept has been realized and tested on a large variety of engine sizes and types. Some test results are shown to evaluate the potential of lean burn high compression engines. 68</page><page sequence="52">790387-790393 790387. The Effects of Varying Combustion Rate in Spark Ignited Engines. R. H. Thring, Ricardo Con- sulting Engineers Ltd. It has been shown by calculation that, for given engine operating conditions, there should be an optimum rate of combustion for minimum NOx emissions from spark ignited engines. This paper gives experimental results from a single cylinder engine which confirm the theory, and show that, for a particular engine, the normal combustion rate needed reducing at zero EGR and increasing at high EGR rates, in opposition to its natural tendency to decrease. The effect on economy was a small loss at zero EGR, but an appreciable improvement at high EGR. Cyclic variation and octane requirement studies are also included. 790388. Increased Burning Rates Offer Improved Fuel Economy-NOx Emissions Trade-Offs in Spark- Ignition Engines. James H. Tuttle and Richard R. Toepel, General Motors Research Labs. Mass burning rate was varied by using two single-cylinder engines, each fitted with different combustion-chamber geometries. The slower-burning chamber incorporated a side-mounted spark plug, the faster-burning chamber combined a more compact combustion space and a centrally located spark plug. The faster-burning engine exhibited an improved efficiency-NOx emissions trade-off, primarily due to the engine's higher maximum thermal efficiency and greater tolerance to charge dilution by recirculated exhaust gas. Faster burning also reduced cyclic variability in combustion, increased the knock-limited thermal effi- ciency, but offered no advantage in regard to hydrocarbon emissions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790389. Effects of a Prechamber on NOx Formation Process in the SI Engine. M. Konishi, N. Nakamura, E. Oono and T. Baika, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and S. Sanda, Nippon Soken, Inc. The NOx emission of the Toyota Lean Burn Engine is lower than that of a conventional engine due to the presence of a prechamber called a "Turbulence Gener- ating Pot." The mechanism of this NOx reduction was analyzed experimentally and theoretically. The results showed that large-scale mixing motions of burned gases were caused in the post flame region as a result of the jet flow from the prechamber. It was concluded that the reduction of NOx emission was due to the decrease of temperature gradient and lowered mean temperature of burned gases caused by these motions. 790390. Design of a Process Control System for Auto- mobile Assembly Process. Francis E. Pionka, Mfg. Eng'rg. Staff, Stamping &amp; Assy. Division, Chrysler Corporation; Walten M. Hancock, Professor-Industrial &amp; Operations Eng'rg., The University of Michigan; and Prakash T. Sathe, Mfg. Eng'rg. Staff, Stamping &amp; Assy. Division, Chrysler Corporation. A problem solving methodology to analyze an integrated multistage production process is described in this paper. The methodology segregates each stage into an independent entity thereby simplifying the analysis to determine the root cause of an output quality problem. This methodology is applied to the automobile body sealing process. The application shows how sealing effectiveness can be traced to the dimensional quality of parts &amp; controls exercised in the assembly process. 790391. Process Analysis. William J. Wiechec, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; and William C. Lentz, Cheverolet Motor Div., General Mo- tors Corp. Process Analysis is a presentation of methods and guidelines established for conducting process studies. The statistical techniques defined as Process Performance and Process Capability are used to determine what the process is producing in terms of variation for specific charac- teristics. The establishment of a common approach for conducting process studies can be achieved for the majority of all processes using these guidelines. 1979 SA E Transactions 790392. Communicating Reliability to Design Engineers. H. J. Bajaría, Lawrence Institute of Technology. Communicating reliability to design engineers is one tough task. With the exception of the aerospace industry, reliability engineering efforts can at best be compared with newly laid grass sod which has not taken to root yet. The major amount of publicity given to the industries' reliability efforts belongs to product reliability assessment and- performance areas. The reliability engineering dis- cipline which really advocates prevention in the design engineering process is not yet well-integrated in the total product creation process. This paper examines the preceding situation as a "communication" problem among design engineers, re- liability engineers and management. It is contended that the reliability engineering process, if properly commu- nicated and organized as discussed, will be a significant expansion of conventional reliability engineering and organizational practices. 1979 SA E Transactions 790393. High-Performance Composite Brake Pedal As- sembly. R. S. Kiwak and R. M. Rusnak, Bendix Research Labs; and K. H. Fulmer, Bendix Automotive Control Systems Group. A brake pedal assembly was selected to demonstrate feasibility of achieving significant weight saving through the use of continuous-fiber-reinforced composites. The 69</page><page sequence="53">790394-790399 assembly was designed to (a) meet or exceed the strength and stiffness of steel, (b) have a noncatastrophic failure mode, and (c) have potential for high-volume production. The pedal blade was formed from a hollow graph- ite/epoxy tube in a matched die mold. Mechanical testing of assemblies showed strength and stiffness exceeding the steel design. On overload, the blade had a desirable failure mode, with progressive ply-by-ply fracture rather than complete brittle fracture. The graph- ite/epoxy part exceeded all specifications of the steel counterpart at a weight saving of over 50 percent. 1979 SA E Transactions 790394. Auto- Adjusting Leading/Trailing Shoe Car Drum Brakes. C. H. Pace, Lucas Girling Ltd. Motor manufacturers are still using leading/trailing drum brakes on the rear axle of passenger cars. The main reasons for this persistence are that handbrakes can be incorporated which give similar performance in either direction, and have simple but very effective automatic adjusters. This paper describes two brakes, both intended to use with forward pull handbrakes, each having a very different automatic adjuster. One being a 'one shot' type and the other a linear incremental type. The construction, function and advantages of each are outlined together with the main parameters which affect the degree of adjustment which can take place. 1979 SA E Transactions 790395. Deceleration Conscious Apportioning Valves for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks. H. Rath and G. Roggenbuck, Girling Continental Operations. The behaviour of two types of inertia controlled ball reducing valves is analysed and test results show how some measure of load conscious brake apportioning behaviour is achieved without the need for load linkages. 1979 SA E Transactions 790396. Calculation of Disc Brakes Components Using the Finite Element Method with Emphasis on Weight Deduction. K. H. Timtner, Alfred Teves Technologies GmbH, Inc. Calculation of disc brake components using the Finite Element Method with emphasis on weight reduction. Finite Element Calculation is now being increasingly used to calculate new, and to optimise existing designs of complex brake components. This paper describes an easy-to-apply Program-System, where the presentation of the structure is particularly simplified. Sophisticated Finite Elements are used to give accu- rate results with the least calculation time. The adaption of this Finite Element System to disc brake components is illustrated using three examples. First is the thermal behaviour of brake rotors, showing that by suitable design, distortion can be reduced to an acceptable minimum. The creation of notch-stress cal- culations on disc brake back plates, and the deflection of vacuum booster housings complete the examples selected. 1979 SA E Transactions 790397. Experimental Analysis of Engine Cooling Sys- tems. A. Costelli, P. Gabriele and D. Giordanengo, FIAT Research Center (Italy). The critical factor characterising a cooling system optim- isation process is the air circuit, for the theoretical prediction of its behaviour is up to now not yet satisfactory. In this situation it is extremely useful to have information gained by empirical testing. This paper describes the simulation techniques and the experimental methods employed by FIAT Research Center. They can be applied both during the development stage (mock-ups) and on definite vehicles. The possibility is so achieved to meet development requirements together with gaining basic knowledge for a more effective designing. 790398. Passenger-Car Ventilation for Thermal Comfort. J. Temming and W. H. Hucho, Volkswagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/West Germany). For cost reasons, passenger cars sold in moderate climatic zones frequently come without factory-installed air conditioning. Therefore, the temperatures in the vehicle occupant compartment may rise above the thermal comfort range during hot summer months. In order to provide for a maximum of thermal comfort under those circumstances, occupant compartment ventilation should satisfy certain clearly defined requirements. The paper submits the physiological rationale and a concrete description of these requirements. A special method, the so-called isotach method, was developed in order to permit a quantitative determination of the vehicle occupant cell air flow and to verify compliance with the air flow requirements. The isotach method is used to measure the air flow distribution in a lateral cross section of the vehicle occupant compartment front section. The method is described and explained. While the application of the isotach method to given vehicles does not pose any problems, there are frequent requests for airflow data projections during the first stages of new vehicle development. The paper presents a computing process that permits prognoses of the air-flow velocities downstream from the fresh air outlets. 790399. The Heat Transfer Coefficient of a Passenger Car's Body. J. Nitz and W.-H. Hucho, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). The heat transfer coefficient of the car's body is one of the parameters controlling the heat balance inside the pas- senger compartment under steady state and transient conditions. Applying the analogy to the heat exchanger, the heat transfer coefficient of a car can be measured with 70</page><page sequence="54">790400-790409 no regard to the inhomogeneity of the heat transferring surface. A formula connecting the heat transfer coefficient with driving speed and ventilation air flow is derived from experiments, which holds for the three classes of cars considered. 790400. Performance of Aluminum Automotive Radiators. William King and W. C. Weltman, Alcoa Laboratories. This paper discusses the field performance of flux brazed aluminum automobile radiators removed from cars after service periods as long as ten years. The data, representing service experience dating back to the early 1950's, show aluminum to be a viable material of construction. With attention to design, adequate flux removal treatments and routine maintenance of coolants extended satisfactory service can be expected. 790401. Repair of Aluminum Heat Exchangers. R. W. Gunkel and W. C. Weltman, Aluminum Com- pany of America. Repair of aluminum heat exchangers is relatively easy when the appropriate techniques are used. Three flux and three fluxless repair procedures are discussed in detail. Two tables list the recommended in-plant and field repair techniques for various heat-exchangers based on appli- cation and method of manufacture. Easy field repair of Freon- type soldered heat-exchangers using an interme- diate temperature solder and noncorrosive flux is de- scribed. 790402. ASTM Engine Coolant Testing. W. H. Ailor, Reynolds Metals Co. For more than 30 years, ASTM Committee D-15 on Engine Coolants has been active in the development, refinement and promotion of test methods for antifreezes and inhibited coolants. The recent emphasis on higher operating temperatures and weight-reducing materials for automotive radiators, heater cores, and engine blocks and heads has increased the need for standards development and modernization. 790403. Old Materials + New Design Techniques = Lighter Steering Systems. R. W. Crain, Powertrain and Chassis Product Engineering, Ford Motor Company. New or exotic materials are now available to the design engineer for execution of his designs. However, when the cost objectives for the component or system preclude the use of these materials, the engineer must resort to the standard, low-cost lightweight materials, such as SAE 308 aluminum. Careful design and the use of new or special design techniques will still allow sizeable weight reduction. Two examples illustrating different methods of designing or testing around the properties of old and familiar materials are taken from the design of the steering system of the 1978 Fairmont and 1979 Ford Mustang, where a 46% reduction in system weight was achieved without the use of expensive high strength materials. 790404. HSLA Stamped Steel Spindle Development Program. M. E. Gatt, The Bendix Corporation. This paper describes the engineering activity used in the design and preliminary development of a lightweight, low cost, stamped steel front axle spindle assembly. Design revisions from the basic concept as they relate to manufacturing and structural integrity considerations are addressed. The analytical and empirical techniques used to prove design feasibility are also described. 790405. Study of Hollow Stabilizer Bar. Shoji Matsuki, Horikiri Spring Mfg. Co., Ltd. A remarkable weight savings can be achieved through usage of a hollow stabilizer bar. The amount of weight savings is dependent on shape, design, material and methods of manufacture. In general, a 25% weight savings can be achieved through usage of hollow instead of solid bars. 1979 SAE Transactions 790407. Material and Processing Effects on Fatigue Performance of Leaf Springs. R. W. Landgraf and R. C. Francis, Ford Motor Co. Procedures are developed for assessing the influence of various material and processing factors on the fatigue performance of leaf springs. Cyclic material properties, determined from smooth axial specimens of spring steel, are used to determine the level and cyclic stability of residual stresses resulting from mechanical processing as well as the amount of permanent deformation associated with presetting operations. A damage parameter, incor- porating material properties, residual stress effects and applied stressing conditions, is used to predict failure location, i.e., surface or subsurface, and lifetime as a function of processing sequence. Predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental bending results. 1979 SAE Transactions 790409. Sag Resistance of Si-Mo and Si-Cr Spring Steels. F. Borik, V. A. Bišs and Y. E. Smith, Climax Molybdenum Co. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Sag resistance was determined for a series of standard and experimental spring steels containing varying amounts of silicon, chromium and molybdenum. Of particular interest was the comparison in sag resistance among the SAE 5160, SAE 9260, Mn-Cr-Mo, lSi-l/2Cr and lSi-0.1Mo steels quenched and tempered to a common hardness of 50 HRC. The sag resistance was determined by room temperature relaxation tests in which the specimens were stressed in tension for 150 hours under a given plastic strain. The results showed that in general the sag resistance increased as the silicon content increased. It was also observed that the higher the plastic strain applied in the relaxation tests the more beneficial effect molyb- 71</page><page sequence="55">790410-790416 denum additions had on sag resistance. 790410. Coil Spring Design, An Analytical View. Arthur R. Solomon, Chevrolet Div., Generai Motors Corp. Variable rate coil springs will improve the overall ride of light vehicles. A new computer program, developed by Chevrolet to simulate the operational characteristics of tapered wire and/or noncylindrical variable rate coil springs, has become an integral part of the design process. This analytical tool has provided new insight into the physics of variable rate, as well as constant rate, coil springs. 1979 SA E Transactions 790412. M113A1/M113A1E1 Improved Cooling System. Alan J. Samuel and Alan M. Loss, FMC Corp., Ordnance Engrg. Div.; and David M. Latson, U.S. Army Tank - Automotive Materiel Readi- ness Command. U.S. Army studies concluded that engine problems in the M113A1 Family of Vehicles resulted primarily from cooling system deficiencies. This conclusion led to the development of an Improved Cooling System (ICS) which provides approximately 15°F coolant temperature reduc- tion under full load, low speed/high tractive effort conditions; eliminates the collection of the oil and dirt mixture which packs on the radiator heat transfer surfaces; provides a negative pressure engine compart- ment for CBR application and reduction of exhaust fume leakage to personnel compartment; and provides in- creased drawdown capacity. In addition, the basic configuration of the ICS has been designed to be compatible with product-improved/ up-powered versions of the M113A1 such as the M113A1E1 currently under development by the U.S. Army. Basically, the ICS interchanges positions of the fan and radiator on the current production M113A1, with the air flow direction remaining the same. "System analysis" studies were performed using both FMC and TARADCOM cooling system computer programs to "optimize" the design of the system. Generalized work done jointly by FMC and TARADCOM in tracked vehicle cooling system design was applied. As the result of successful testing the M113A1/ICS is planned for production incorporation mid- 1979. 799413. Pulsed Holographic Analysis of Large Vibrating Vehicle Components. Grant R. Gerhart and Gregory Arutunian, Tank- Automoti ve Research and Development Command, Warren, MI. Double exposure, pulsed holography has several inherent advantages as a tool for the vibration analysis of large vehicle components. Since the laser is pulsed at a relatively rapid repetition rate, the time period between the two pulses is sufficiently fast that the holographic system does not need to be isolated from the vibration background of the laboratory. The recent development of pulsed ruby lasers with large energy outputs and long temporal coherence lengths has made the holographic analysis of large vehicle structures feasible and within the state-of-the-art. 1979 SA E Transactions 790414. Development of Armored Personnel Carrier M113A1E1. Burton W. Long, FMC Corp.; and Anthony Comito, U.S. Army TARADCOM. This paper discusses the development of an improved armored personnel carrier, the M113A1E1 for the U.S. Army. This vehicle is an improved/modernized version of the standard M113A1-APC. The development included improving the suspension, increasing the horsepower, improving the cooling, changing the drive train and driver's controls, and improving personnel safety by moving the fuel tanks to an external location. Prototypes were built and are undergoing development and opera- tional testing at U.S. Government proving grounds. 790415. Research and Development Efforts in Military Antifreeze Formulations. James H. Conley and Robert G. Jamison, U.S. Army Mobility Equip- ment Research and Development Command, Energy &amp; Water Resources Lab., Ft. Belvoir, VA. The U.S. Army was convinced as early as 1941 that a composition type antifreeze was desirable. The Army's needs are much more complex, and operating conditions more severe than the individual automobile owner. Army vehicles must be in the best possible operating condition at all times. These vehicles may be sent to almost any part of the world, and have to be combat ready on short notice. Operating conditions can be severe, requiring both highway and off highway operation. Heat loads on the vehicles' cooling system vary depending upon the loads being carried and the terrain over which they are required to travel. Indiscriminate use of commercial antifreeze- coolants could result in cooling system failure. Mixtures of two good antifreeze formulations could have a direct effect on the corrosion protection of cooling system metals. In combat situations this could be disastrous. 790416. Prediction of Track Tension When Traversing an Obstacle. G. R. Doyle, Jr., Battelle's Columbus Lab.; and G. H. Workman, Applied Mechanics Inc. Slow, steady state, negotiation of an obstacle by a military tracked vehicle has been identified as a cause of large increases in track tension. A two-dimensional, finite- element model was formulated to predict track tension in a double-pin track used on the M60 tank. Increases in track tension produced by obstacles between road wheels and directly under a road wheel were assessed. Exper- imental results validated the accuracy of the finite-element 72</page><page sequence="56">790417-790422 technique. Variations in several of the tank and track properties provided quantitative insight into the causes of high track tension. 790417. Effect of Fuels and Dilution Ratio on Diesel Particulate Emissions. Larry E. Frisch, Dow Corning Facilities Engrg.; John H. Johnson and David G. Leddy, Michigan Technological Univ. An experimental investigation of the effect of fuel variables and exhaust dilution on diesel particulate emissions from a Caterpillar 3208 direct injection natu- rally aspirated engine is presented. Three test fuels with widely varying gravity, volatility, aromatic and sulfur content were used. Exhaust dilution was varied from 50 to 1 volume dilution ratio to 1 to 1 (undiluted). Particulate characterization of the total particulates, sulfates, soluble organic fraction and the fractional breakdown of the soluble fraction are shown. Both fuel variables and exhaust dilution were shown to have a significant effect on the measured particulate emission levels. 1979 SA E Transactions 790418. The Characterization of the Soluble Organic Fraction of Diesel Particulate Matter. Eric F. Funkenbusch, David G. Leddy and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. This paper is concerned with the demonstration of a methodology for chemically characterizing diesel particu- late organic matter (POM) emissions. The procedure begins with a Soxhlet extraction of the POM with dichloromethane to obtain a soluble organic fraction (SOF). The acidic and basic portions of the SOF are isolated by liquid-liquid extraction techniques with aque- ous base and aqueous acid, respectively. The neutral portion of the extract is separated into paraffin, aromatic, transitional and oxygenated fractions by column chroma- tography on silica gel. Two additional fractions, the ether insoluble and hexane insoluble fractions, are also sepa- rated by the procedure. Quantitative mass data are presented on the extraction and fractionation of twelve particulate samples from the exhaust of a medium-duty diesel engine collected in a dilution tunnel at a volume dilution ratio of 8 to 1 . Three fuels with a range of properties and two steady-state engine conditions from the EPA 13 Mode Cycle were used as experimental variables in this study. 1979 SA E Transactions 790419. Benzo (a) pyrene Emissions from Gasoline and Diesel Automobiles. R. L. Williams, General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI; and S. J. Swarin, General Motors Research Labs., War- ren, MI. A data base was obtained from comparing the benzo (a) pyrene (BaP) emission rates from diesel automobiles with those from current-production, catalyst and noncatalyst gasoline automobiles. Exhaust particulate samples were collected on filters, using a large emission tunnel. The extractable portion of the exhaust particulate was re- moved by Soxhlet extraction, with a mixture of benzene and ethanol. The BaP determination was made by high-performance liquid chromatography, using fluores- cence detection. The BaP emission rate from an Oldsmobile diesel car was the same as the average rate from seven noncatalyst gasoline cars, 2.7 micrograms per mile. The BaP mass concentration in the diesel particulate was five parts per million, about twenty times lower than that in noncatalyst gasoline particulate. BaP emission rates showed no simple correlation with hydrocarbon or carbon monoxide emission rates. The catalytic converter reduced BaP emission by more than 95% on gasoline cars, but had no effect on BaP emission from a diesel car. 1979 SA E Transactions 790420. Particulates and Associated Emissions From Two Medium-Duty Diesel Engines. D. E. Seizinger, B. H. Eccleston and R. W. Hurn, Department of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Experimental data were obtained from two medium-duty diesel engines derated to qualify for use in underground mines. Gaseous and particulate emissions from these engines were measured and results provide information on the effect of exhaust treatment devices on the emissions. The devices in the study were a catalyst, a particulate trap, and an exhaust gas cooler of the water scrubber type. Emission levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocar- bons were observed to be very low in comparison with emissions levels of comparable engines in full-rated operation. Oxides of nitrogen and benzo(a)pyrene content of the exhaust also were found to be somewhat low in comparison with previous findings. For particulate reduc- tion, the combination of a particulate trap and a scrubber was observed to be the more effective of the combinations tried; in some cases over 60% particulate reduction was effected by the trap/scrubber combination. 790421. Particle Size Variation in Diesel Car Exhaust. P. J. Groblicki and C. R. Begeman, General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. The Electrical Aerosol Analyzer (EAA) has been used to measure the particle size-distribution of the exhaust aerosol produced by five diesel cars under a variety of steady-state operating conditions. A good correlation was found between simultaneous EAA and filter determina- tions of mass emission rate for these cars. For the entire range of cars, speeds, and loads tested, the mass median diameter was about 0.1 /im, with a range from 0.05 /im to 0.22 /im. There was no consistent effect of speed on particle size in the group of cars, but there was a slight tendency toward larger particle sizes as the load increased. 790422.

The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, which call for broad study of motor vehicle particulate emissions, coupled with requirements for improved fuel economy, have greatly increased the interest and study of diesel powered motor vehicles. Analytical procedures are de- scribed which permit measurement of diesel organic emissions, including the particulate and gas phases, from carbon number 1 to carbon number 40. The partitioning of the emitted organics between the gas and particulate phases is examined with a variety of controllable sampling parameters. These parameters include variations in particulate sampling probe config- urations and sampling rates, variable dilution ratios and corresponding temperatures, and filter media. 790424. Characterization of Particulate and Gaseous Emissions from Two Diesel Automobiles as Functions of Fuel and Driving Cycle. Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas M. Baines, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. Particulate and gaseous emissions from two light-duty diesel vehicles were measured over eight operating schedules, using five different fuels. Characterization included regulated exhaust emissions and a number of unregulated constituents. Non-routine gas measurements included phenols, hydrocarbon boiling range, and alde- hydes. Particulate characterization included mass rates and concentrations, visible smoke aerodynamic sizing, total organics, BaP, sulfate, phenols, trace elements, and major elements. Statistical analysis of emissions data was undertaken using fuel properties and operating schedule statistics as independent variables. Regressions were computed for a few variables, and analysis of variance and multiple comparisons were used where the data were not suitable for regression analysis. 790425. The Petroleum Mentality - Bane or Boon. E. Eugene Ecklund and Ralph D. Fleming, U.S. Department of Energy. Over the last century, petroleum has become the major source of energy for transportation and the raw material for petrochemical products. As a result, there are tens of thousands of experts who support the technology and contribute to the economy of this country. For people who were born, brought up, educated, and matured in a climate of using and depending on petroleum, it is most logical to think in terms of the resources, processes and products that are used to produce petroleum. If the resulting experience, knowledge and expertise is put to use, this "petroleum mentality" can be a tremendous asset in our search for and the development of new energy sources. However, only a small fraction of this pool of know-how is now being applied to new energy. Obstacles result from assuming too much and from being too comfortable and/or myoptic about the status, the poten- tial, and the needs regarding petroleum substitutes. Open mindedness, proper attention, and rational consideration can and should change this to a positive approach where the know-how can be far more effective. 790426. Alternate Portable Fuels for Internal Combustion Engines. An Assessment by Alternate Fuels Commit- tee of the Engine Manufacturers Association. This report summarizes a committee investigation and analysis of the supply/demand situation for fuels; short and long term changes in fuels as they impact on portable internal combustion engines; potential areas of research on alternate fuels; and identification of priorities for alternate portable fuel research and development. 1979 SA E Transactions 790427. Methanol Decomposition Bottoming Cycle for IC Engines. Ghanshyam Purohit and John Houseman, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst, of Technology. This paper presents the concept of methanol decompo- sition using engine exhaust heat, and examines its potential for use in the operation of passenger cars, diesel trucks, and diesel-electric locomotives. Energy economy improvements of 10-20% are cal- culated over the representative driving cycles without a net loss in power. Some reductions in exhaust emissions are also projected. 790428. Three-Way Conversion Catalysts on Vehicles Fueled with Ethanol-Gasoline Mixtures. J. J. Mooney, J. G. Hansel and K. R. Burns, Engelhard Industries Division, Engelhard Min- erals &amp; Chemicals Corporation, Menlo Park, NJ. Three-way conversion catalysts systems which provide control of three emission components - hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen - generally require the use of closed-loop feedback control of the air/fuel metering system to provide a near stoichiometric exhaust gas composition. As an alternate fuel such as ethyl alcohol is added to gasoline, the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio is altered. Conventional air/fuel metering systems do not compensate for this change. This paper studies the ability of the Volvo closed-loop control fuel injection system, now in use on vehicles in the United States, to maintain the stoichiometric air/fuel mixture needed for optimum emission control and to compensate for the change in fuel stoichiometry encountered in gasoline/alternate fuel mixtures. The system was found to have the ability to completely compensate for gaso- line/ethyl alcohol mixtures up to 30% ethyl alcohol with no loss in emission control. Gasoline/methyl alcohol blends were also tested successfully. 74</page><page sequence="58">790429-790432 There is definite potential for the three-way conver- sion catalyst/closed-loop systems to provide our nation with flexibility in fuel formulation not otherwise found in conventional fuel metering systems. With proper planning and engineering, non-petroleum derived fuels can be blended with gasoline without requiring engine adjust- ments or compromising emission controls. 790429. Practicality of Alcohols as Motor Fuel. T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Company, Chicago, Illi- nois; and D. S. Gray, B. Y. Zarah and A. A. Koziński, Amoco Oil Company, Naperville, Illinois. Several alcohols have been or are being used as motor fuel in limited applications where their unique properties provide a specific benefit. Recently, proposals have been made to manufacture methyl and ethyl alcohols from nonpetroleum feedstocks for use as a primary energy source. Such a program, it is claimed, would reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil; manufacturing ethanol would also stabilize prices of farm commodities. An economical and abundant feedstock for methanol manufacture is North Dakota lignite. In a plant con- suming lignite and self-sufficient in utilities, energy in the methanol would represent about 45 per cent of the energy in the feedstock. The cost of energy from the methanol produced would be about twice that from gasoline at 1979 prices. Liquefaction of lignite or coal to a synthetic crude with subsequent refining by conventional processes would provide motor fuel at somewhat higher energy efficiency and lower cost than by methanol synthesis. Municipal solid wastes could also be used as feedstock for methanol manufacture, but the cost would be even higher than with lignite as feedstock. The lowest cost and most abundant feedstock for ethanol manufacture is corn. With current farming and ethanol manufacturing practices, which use mainly petro- leum-based fuels, energy in the ethanol plus that in the byproducts is only about 55 per cent of the energy in the petroleum fuels consumed. If the ethanol plant used only nonpetroleum fuels such as coal or agricultural wastes for process energy, the efficiency based on just the petroleum fuels used in farming and collection of wastes would range from 130 to 160 per cent; overall efficiency would remain at 55 per cent or less. Energy in the byproducts represents about 40 per cent of the energy output, which greatly complicates evaluation of the efficiency of the plant. In any event, the cost of energy from the ethanol produced would be at least four times that from gasoline. The high cost results from large capital charges, large operating costs and, especially, large raw material costs. While both methanol and ethanol have characteristics that complicate distribution and detract from product quality, poor energy yield and high cost are the most serious deterrents to commercialization of either alcohol. Methanol is definitely preferred, but neither represents a practical alternative unless the price of petroleum-based fuels rises markedly relative to that of the alcohols. 1979 SA E Transactions 790430. Energy Economics of Alternate Fuels. R. Bertodo, Dexion-Comino International Ltd. (United Kingdom). The energy crisis of the mid-1970's released a frantic search for alternative fuels. The present paper reviews the studies undertaken by the Author's Company and outlines experience with broad specification fuels, vegetable oils and alcohols. Tests were undertaken mainly with the diesel engine and its derivatives in mind. It is concluded that, in the medium term, the most effective engine/fuel combination is an injected stratified charge engine burning "wide-cut" fuel oils. Such oil could be obtained by a modification to present natural crude refining practices, or from shale and tar sand distillation, or by coal gasification and hydrogénation, or from oil bearing vegetation. Unfortunately, the energy scene is currently confused by the conflict between short term economic gain and long term conservation needs. As a result attention is being focussed on gasoline-like alter- natives, notably methyl and ethyl alcohol. As a consequence it is thought that carburetted stratified charge engines, burning alcohol-based or alcohol extended fuels, are likely to become dominant in the mobile prime mover field. It is to be hoped that progressive depletion of natural crudes will promote the gradual introduction of a more efficient combination based on an injected stratified charge engine. In any case, eventual shortages of natural fuels will have far reaching implications on the choice of materials for both engine and vehicle manufacture. Government legislation and taxation policies will also be affected. 790431. New Light Alloy Wheel Technology in Europe. R. R. Woodward, GKN Kent Alloys Ltd. This paper acquaints the reader with the reasons for fitting cast aluminium automobile wheels in Europe. It also draws attention to the detailed precautions taken during procurement of the aluminium alloy, the manufacture of the wheel casting, and some of the subsequent operations which are necessary to ensure that the finished wheel is of an acceptable quality to meet the functional end use requirements. 790432. Fiber-Reinforced Automotive Wheels - Promises and Challenges. R. A. Ridha, Central Research Labs., The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. Fiber-reinforced plastic wheels offer reduced weight and better uniformity and easier styling than metal wheels. They present new challenges in wheel design, material processing, nondestructive testing for quality control, and modifying the use pattern of automotive wheels by consumers. Present SAE specifications written for metal wheels should be modified to incorporate properties 75</page><page sequence="59">790433-790437 unique to fiber-reinforced plastics; this requires the cooperative efforts of potential producers and users of the new wheels. 790433. Precombustion Fuel/Air Distribution in a Strat- ified Charge Engine Using Laser Raman Spec- troscopy. Sheridan C. Johnston, Sandia Labo- ratories, Livermore, CA. The application of cw laser Raman spectroscopy to determine precombustion fuel/air distribution in a motored, direct-injected stratified charge (DISC) engine has been demonstrated. The primary objective of the study was to obtain point measurements of the mean, gas-phase fuel/air ratio across a diameter in the combus- tion chamber for a single set of engine operating parameters. A secondary objective was to obtain flow visualization records of the injection-mixing process for both liquid- and gas-phase fuel injection. Results of the study showed that large spatial varia- tions in the fuel/ air ratio occur in the cylinder during and after fuel injection. Near top-dead-center, fuel/air mixing was nearly complete, but the distribution across the cylinder diameter still exhibited a region of relatively low fuel concentration. 1979 SA E Transactions 790434. Performance of a Stratified Charge Engine. C. D. Wood, Southwest Research Inst. An experimental study of a single-cylinder direct-injected stratified charge engine is described, with emphasis upon influences of configuration and injection system details upon performance and exhaust emissions. 790435. Analysis of Light-Load Performance in Rotary Engines. Toshiyuki Kohno, Ryozo Ito, Minoru Morita and Nobutaka Mizuno, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). In rotary engines, misfires or partial burns often tend to occur under light load. By investigating gas composition in the combustion chamber, it was confirmed that these problems were mainly caused by the excess of internal EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) in this range. A study of the processes by which internal EGR develops showed that a rather large proportion of the internal EGR was due to the unique intake-exhaust mechanism of the rotary engine. Favorable combustion was achieved by the use of air injection at the exhaust port, thereby reducing the EGR only in the light load range, and also through the use of glow plugs for improved ignition capacity. 1979 SA E Transactions 790436. Emissions and Economy Potential of Prechamber Stratified Charge Engines. David L. Dimick, Stanley L. Genslak, Ronald E. Greib and Marvin J. Malik, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. In order to meet stringent government emissions stan- dards without penalizing the fuel economy of gasoline engine cars, a number of alternative engine concepts have been investigated. This paper describes a research inves- tigation and parallel development activity on prechamber stratified charge engines. Single-cylinder engine inves- tigations are first described. Alternative design and operating parameters are investigated and compared in these engines. Design and development of two multi- cylinder engine designs incorporating prechamber 3-valve configurations is next described. Finally, a car devel- opment and evaluation program is outlined, using both small and large cars with alternative engine configurations and after treatment devices. Results of the above pre- chamber stratified charge engines are compared with conventional engines in order to assess and evaluate the emission and economy potential of this type of engine. The authors conclude that this type of stratified charge engine possesses NOx emission and fuel economy per- formance similar to a conventional engine but at a high HC emission level. 1979 SA E Transactions 790437. Multi-Dimensional Heat Flow in the Surround- ings of a Pre-Chamber Under Transient Condi- tions. W. Brandstetter and M. Birth, Volks- wagenwerk AG; and P. Stuart, Consulting Engineer. The gas side wall temperatures of the prechamber in a divided chamber diesel or stratified charge engine have an influence on the combustion process. From this results an important effect on exhaust emissions, fuel economy and engine performance. The insulation characteristic of a prechamber insert should ensure a quick warm-up after cold start on one hand but provide not too high temperatures at full load and maximum engine speed on the other. Computations were carried out to quantify the effects of various design parameters and materials on temper- ature, heat flow, stress and deformation and to optimize the design under numerous existing restrictions. An analysis was made of the elastro-plastic behaviour of the insert and the cylinder head, including material creep. For most of the calculations a rotary symmetric model was assumed and solved by the finite element program system MARC. The two-dimensional mesh chosen describes the actual details of the section of the cylinder head, the prechamber insert and the spark plug or fuel injector fairly closely. The gas temperature and the heat transfer coefficient were determined from a separate engine cycle simulation. Preliminary calculations with a one-dimensional mod- el of a composite wall were made in order to optimize the mesh in regard to accuracy and computing time. The main cases studied were the following: a pre- chamber without an insert (base case), an insert insulated by an air gap and being in contact with the cylinder head over a small or larger press fit region, total loss of contact 76</page><page sequence="60">790438-790443 with the cylinder head, a cylindrical insert with and without air gaps, copper alloy and a ceramic as insert material, while stainless steel was used in all other cases. 790438. The Influence of Overall Equivalence Ratio and Degree of Stratification on the Fuel Consumption and Emissions of a Prechamber, Stratified- Charge Engine. James F. Sinnamon, General Motors Research Labs.; and David E. Cole, Univ. of Michigan. An experimental study of a divided-chamber, stratified- chnrge engine has been performed using a modified CFR L-head engine. Emissions and fuel consumption were measured over a wide range of overall fuel-air ratio and degree of stratification by varying the prechamber and main chamber inlet fuel-air ratios. High-speed motion pictures of the combustion process and the spatial distribution of fuel-air ratio in the combustion chamber, measured using a sampling valve, were used to explain the trends in the emissions data. Of particular interest is an increase in NOx emissions with increasing degree of stratification at lean overall fuel-air ratios. 1979 SA E Transactions 790439. A New Combustion System in the Three-Valve Stratified Charge Engine. Shizuo Yagi, I sao Fujii and Masayasu Nishikawa, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd., Hiroshi Shirai, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Through continued research on the combustion system of the stratified charge engine, we have found a new combustion system (named Branched Conduit system) which is able to further reduce exhaust emissions, HC and NOx, in particular with no adverse effect on fuel consumption under the wide range of engine operating conditions. In this paper, we describe the construction of new combustion system and its characteristics including fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. In addition, the combustion process with or without the branched con- duits is examined by the time-resolved measurements of gas pressure and temperature obtained in the main combustion chamber, and observed with high-speed colored photography. 790440. Torch Ignition for Combustion Control of Lean Mixtures. Tim G. Adams, Ford Motor Co. An experimental investigation was made to determine the effect of torch nozzle orientation on burn rate, power, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. With the torch nozzle directed diametrically across the combustion chamber the burn rate and the power were maximized. Exhaust emissions were inversely proportional to burn rate and ISFC. The torch chamber was also investigated as a means of augmenting post combustion turbulence to improve the mixing of the quench layer and thereby reduce the exhaust HC's. A dual ignition, single torch system was tested. It was found that the torch could be activated as much as 90 crank degrees after conventional ignition occurred. The late firing torch was effective in providing additional energy to supplement the cylinder turbulence. The reduction in HC emissions was achieved at the expense of increased fuel consumption. 790441. (P-80) An Approach to a Quiet Car Diesel Engine. Heinz A. Fachbach and Gerhard E. Thien, AVL Prof. List Ges.m.b.H., Graz, Aus- tria. The paper presents a new development of low-noise passenger car and small truck diesel engine. As described in the first section of this contribution the new design concept is mainly characterized by the vibration isolation between the vibration excited internal engine structure and the external engine casing, obtained by elastic elements specially developed for this purpose. The external engine casing and the flywheel housing are designed as one part where the gear box can be bolted on in the usual way. An essential part of the paper is dedicated to the description of preliminary theoretical and experimental investigations into the design of the vibra- tion isolating elements between the so-called crankframe and the external housing and to the description of the design of the external housing. In the following the test results gained on a prototype engine featuring the mentioned design principle are discussed. This prototype engine is a water-cooled 2.2 liter diesel engine. The last section finally proves that particularly good results with regard to economic viability can be achieved by using engines of the above design in different vehicles, such as cars, small trucks and farm tractors. 790442. (P-80) A Survey of Passenger Car Noise Levels. D. Morrison and B. J. Challen, Ricardo Con- sulting Engineers. Results from noise tests on 18 passenger cars are reported. The sample contains both diesel and gasoline engined vehicles and two (a SAAB 99 and Peugeot 504 GLD) are examined in detail over their normal operating range. The effects of vehicle operations are examined and differences between vehicles compared. For equivalent engines there is shown to be little difference between vehicle noise for diesel and gasoline engines for current legislative test procedures, although idle and low speed noise levels are increased significantly in the case of the diesel engine. At vehicle speeds above 80km/h in top gear, rolling noise dominates the total vehicle radiated noise. 790443. (P-80) An Experimental Passenger Car Diesel Engine. E. C. Grover and R. D. H. Perry, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton. This paper describes the design and initial evaluation of a 77</page><page sequence="61">790444-790450 novel concept of crankcase design applied to a 2 litre high speed diesel engine. This design offers lightweight eco- nomic production and low noise without compromising performance. 790444. (P-80) The Effect of Structure Design on High Speed Automotive Diesel Engine Noise. D. Anderton and J. Dixon, ISVR, University of Southampton, England; C. M. P. Chan, Search Engineering Ltd., England; and S. Andrews, British Leyland Cars, England. The paper describes the assessment and testing of two high speed diesel engine structure modifications designed to reduce noise. The modifications tested are a five main bearing version of a standard three main bearing engine and the addition of a sump plate. The results indicate that it is difficult to assess the running engine vibration and noise characteristics using modal analysis techniques but that this is possible when using the banger test techniques. It is shown that noise reductions up to some 4.0 - 5.0 dBA can be achieved both on the test bed and in the vehicle application. 790445. (P-80) Some Aspects Concerning Noise Reduc- tion on Diesel Passenger Cars. Hans-Peter Charzinski and Hermann Hiereth, Daimler-Benz AG. The main noise sources of a diesel passenger car are determined and possible noise level reductions are assessed. Primary damping measures such as influencing it by means of modifying the combustion itself as well as secondary measures such as encapsulation are described. A vehicle-supported encapsulation of the engine utilizing parts of the body is discussed in more detail. A research vehicle was built. A description of design function, and practical realization of such a vehicle-supported encapsu- lation including the necessary development of a new cooling sytem is given. Finally, the maximum possible reduction of the external noise levels using this design as well as the problems connected with encapsulation - such as the resulting increase in internal vehicle noise and vehicle weight, reduced ground clearance and mainte- nance accessibility - are reported and critically evaluated. 790446.

(P-80) Practical Investigation of Noise Reduction of a Diesel Passenger Car. A. Petitdidier, Au- tomobiles Citroën. The present stage of technique still does not allow the manufacturing of Diesel engines as silent as gasoline engines. However, a rational use of classical insulating processes will enable Diesel engine passenger cars to have, from now on, an acoustic quality close to that of gasoline engine vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to describe a practical example of the insulation of a passenger car with a Diesel engine. 790449. (P-80) Concept for a Chassis Mounted Capsule of Engine and Gearbox for Heavy Trucks. Gerhard K. Krisper and Helmut H. Kratochwill, Steyr- Daimler-Puch AG, Austria. The proposed reduction of noise by international legis- lation will probably result in a limit of 80 dB(A), measured according to ISO R 362. In order to obtain a uniform noise level for all categories of vehicles, the 80 dB(A)-limit is also forecast for heavy trucks in about 5 to 10 years. With a high powered conventional Diesel-engine, this limit can only be reached by complete enclosure of engine and gearbox. In this paper, we present a capsule mounted on the chassis, adapted to the cramped space conditions in a European truck. The design has the advantage of ease of maintenance, since it is possible to attach the upper capsule parts to the tipping-cab. The results of the noise and temperature measurements are also reported. The great reduction of the surface noise by the capsule requires the installation of a radiator-fan-system, which is designed to reduce noise considerably. 790450. (P-80) Research Project for Reducing the Noise of Truck Diesel Engines. Ing. Karl F. Feitzelmayer and Ing. W. Schröder, Maschinen- fabrik Augsburg Nürnberg (M.A.N.) Aktien- gesellschaft (Germany). The first efforts to attenuate noise from motor vehicles go back to the 1930s. Significant developments in noise attenuation research culminating in 1974 with the pres- entation (FVV-AVL) of a water-cooled and an air-cooled research engine enclosed in a close-fitting capsule are addressed. Two basic studies are described as representative of individual research carried out by commercial vehicle manufacturers: body-mounted capsules for diesel truck engines and tests on close-fitting capsules performed on the test stand. The enclosed water-cooled engine and a basic engine without a capsule were each mounted on a truck chassis in order to test the effectiveness of the capsule and to compare measurements taken with the enclosed engine on the test stand with those taken with the engine in the 78</page><page sequence="62">790451-790458 vehicle. Despite the discrepancies between the two sets of data, the results of the vehicle tests were satisfactory. 790451. (P-80) Noise Emission of Air-Cooled Automotive Diesel Engines and Trucks. H.-A. Kochanowski, W. Kaiser and D. Esche, Klöckner-Humboldt- Deutz AG, Cologne, G.F.R. Examples of the development of two engine series of KHD company are given to illustrate the noise improve- ments achieved in the past. Moreover, the present development work for further noise reduction is reported. Of special importance is an adequate combination of the various noise reduction measures to achieve low noise levels in acceleration tests of vehicles. In this connection, emphasis is given to measures on the combustion system, cooling blower, measures for the reduction of engine sound radiation and measures on the truck. 790452. (P-80) The Transport and Road Research Lab- oratory Quiet Heavy Vehicle Project. A. R. Cawthorne and J. W. Tyler, Transport and Road Research Laboratory, Crowthorne, England. Research into means of reducing noise from diesel- engined goods vehicles of 30-40 tonnes gross vehicle weight has shown that engine redesign can reduce noise from this component by 5-10 dB(A) within reasonable production, performance and cost constraints. Attention to the exhaust system, cooling package, engine covers and chassis design has resulted in a 10 dB(A) reduction in noise in the cab. Results are quoted from a number of experimental vehicle builds and the basis for a demon- stration vehicle built to production standards which should meet a target drive-past noise level of 80 dB(A) is described. 790454. (P-80) Statistical Approach for Diesel Engine Noise Analysis. R. Padoan, Renault Véhiculés Industriels (France); and M. Jocteur Monrozier, Renault Vehicles Industriels (France). In urban traffic vehicle use leads to running conditions which vary essentially according to torque and speed. An experimental multiparametric analysis has been carried out on this subject. The results of the experiment confirm the main noise causing parameters. Noise prediction formulae can also be drawn up for any engine running conditions. As a result of this analysis the noise of one of the engines could be reduced by 7 dB(A) by acting on combustion and mechanical parts, as well as on sound radiation. 790455. Influence of Antiskid Systems on Vehicle Direc- tional Dynamics. E. Bisimis, Alfred Teves GmbH (Frankfurt/Germany). The results presented demonstrate the influence of longitudinal tire slip and load transfer during braking on steering behavior of cars in terms of parameters which have been found to be important for the function of the driver/vehicle control loop. This is followed by a descrip- tion of an antiskid system and a comparison of directional properties during braking with conventional brake system and with antiskid. The importance of appropriate selec- tion of slip levels during adaptation of antiskid systems to a given vehicle is pointed out. 1979 SA E Transactions 790456. An Improved Radar Anticollision Device. John B. Flannery, John C. Sims, Jr., Snelling R. Brainard and Leon Ruderman, Collision Avoid- ance Systems. The authors describe an automotive anticollision device which uses pulsed radar and is controlled by a micro- processor. The radar and its control significantly reduce false target response, loss of braking due to multi-path signal cancellation and blinding from other radar equipped vehicles. Increased range with reduced false target response allows warning of an impending collision and effective automatic braking. 790457. Electronic Control Systems for Ground Vehicles. Edward J. Hayes and George W. Megginson, Kelsey-Hayes Co., Romulus, MI. The wide spread installation of anti-wheel lock systems in the United States has been interrupted. To assist the continuity of development after this interruption, we believe it worthwhile to review some of the designs that have evolved to date. Potential for antilock to improve vehicle stability during heavy braking has been demon- strated. However, with the current situation in the United States, Europe and Japan will probably lead the way in the popular use of electronic antilock systems. 790458. Antiskid System for Passenger Cars with a Digital Electronic Control Unit. Heinz Leiber and Armin Czinczel, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart/Germany). By introducing modern digital electronics, BOSCH succeeded in developing a high-performance antiskid system for passenger cars. A digital design approach was chosen since it allows for a greater degree of integration than an analog design. This results in increased reliability. The hydraulic unit comprises three of four solenoid valves and a return pump driven by an electric motor. The system prevents vehicle swerving and maintains steerability while attaining re- markable gains in stopping distance at the same time. As passenger cars developed, brake systems also improved steadily. Today almost optimal brake force generation has been achieved which assures stable braking on uniform roadways without any yaw movements as long as there is no excessive braking. Excessive braking will result in wheel lock-up. In this case the vehicle is no longer steerable, may even swerve and in general the stopping distance will be longer than with optimal brake action. 79</page><page sequence="63">790459-790463 Therefore, the objective of the antiskid system (ÄBS) is to reduce the brake pressure in the individual wheel should excessive braking occur so that the wheels generate maximum brake force without locking. Thus vehicle steerability is maintained and vehicle swerving prevented. Although the first patents concerning antiskid systems date back to 1905, actual development did not begin until 1957. By 1966 the control problems experienced had been essentially solved. However, the introduction of high- performance antiskid systems, which also maintain steer- ability, failed in the following period due to their complexity and reliability problems with the electronic control unit which comprised numerous discrete elec- tronic components. Simplified mechanical components and introduction of new technologies for the electronic control unit characterize the BOSCH high-performance ABS system for passenger cars. 1979 SAE Transactions 790459. Fatigue Crack Growth Rate Testing of Two Structural Steels. N. E. Dowling and H. Walker, Westinghouse Research and Development Cen- ter, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, PA. A cooperative testing program on fatigue crack growth rate was organized by a division of the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee. Two structural steels in plate form typical of those used in the ground vehicle industry were tested, with seven laboratories performing fatigue crack growth rate tests. Excellent agreement among laboratories is obtained in control tests at a load ratio of R = 0.1. Test data are reported for additional R values ranging from -1.0 to 0.8, and also for cracking both parallel and transverse to the rolling direction. 1979 SAE Transactions 790460. Strain-Controlled Fatigue Properties of USS EX-TEN F50 Steel. J. M. Holt and B. K. Stewart, U.S. Steel Corp., Research Lab., Monroeville, PA. A program was conducted to examine the variability of fatigue properties within a single grade of steel. Mono- tonic tension and strain-controlled fatigue tests were performed on longitudinal specimens from seven sheets of USS EX-TEN F50 steel obtained from five coils of three heats which ranged in thickness from 0.100 to 0.188 inch. The results of this study showed that the slopes of the elastic strain, plastic strain, and stress versus reversals and stress versus plastic strain lines are not statistically different for the seven sheets. Also, the intercepts are the same. The results showed that EX-TEN F50 cyclically softens to strains of 0.5 percent. This study gives no evidence that the strain-controlled fatigue properties of EX-TEN F50 steel vary more among sheets from different coils than within a single sheet and, therefore, gives no evidence that sampling from more than a single sheet is necessary to estimate the fatigue properties. 790461. Fatigue Properties of Cold-Rolled Sheet Steels. A. R. Krause, R. W. Landgraf and B. T. Crandall, Ford Motor Co. Fatigue characteristics of representative cold-rolled, high strength steels, in gages ranging from 0.072 in. (1.83 mm) to 0.055 in. (1.39 mm), were determined in fully-reversed, axial strain cycling at amplitudes up to 0.01. Alloys were selected from three families of high strength steels: recovery annealed steels, conventional microalloyed steels - nitrogenized steel and rephosphorized steel, and dual phase steel. Cold rolled low-carbon steel provided a comparative baseline. Cyclic stress-strain curves are presented to indicate the degree of cyclic stability achievable by various strengthening mechanisms while relative fatigue resistance is determined from strain-life curves. The implications of these behavioral trends to component down gaging are discussed. 1979 SAE Transactions 790462. Fatigue Properties of Sheet Steel Before and After Galvanizing. R. Pietrowski and J. R. Hiam, Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Canada). Some automotive components made from thinner sheet steels (conventional and high strength steels) are making use of corrosion protection, particularly hot dip galva- nizing. This paper studies the effects of continuous strip hot dip galvanizing on the fatigue properties. Three steels were studied before and after galvanizing - an aluminum killed drawing quality steel, a non shape controlled, and a shape controlled 50 k.s.i. steels were taken. From comparisons with previously obtained data for uncoated steels and corroded steels it was shown that, although a small decrease in fatigue strength resulted from the galvanizing, the elimination of corrosion effects caused a net improvement in performance. 1979 SAE Transactions 790463. Characterization of the Low Cycle Fatigue Prop- erties of Hot Rolled Sheet Steels. T. E. Parker, Research and Development Dept., The Steel Company of Canada, Ltd. With the increased emphasis on fuel economy coupled with more stringent safety and crash worthiness require- ments, the automotive designer is faced with evaluating new designs and new sheet steels to achieve weight savings in applications which are potentially fatigue critical. Strain-based cumulative damage techniques are becoming available for handling these types of fatigue problems. An important input to the analysis is the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of the material in the critical location of the component. The purpose of this paper is to summarize LCF properties of HRLC and HSLA automotive sheet steels over a range in strength of 30 to 90 ksi and a range in hot-rolled thickness of 0.070 to 0.180 in. in the as-received condition prior to fabrication. Trends in 80</page><page sequence="64">790464-790478 average LCF properties with increasing strength level are described along with an evaluation of material variability. Examples of how this information might be used are given. 790464. The "Asset" Technique - Assessment of Simu- lated Service Endurance Tests. H. J. Tumbrink and D. Stroh, Girling Continental Ops. (Koblenz/West Germany). The "Asset" technique sets out to portray in principle how genuine service loads can be simulated, with an adequate confidence level, by test stand methods. The mathematical justification for this simulation is treated in broad outline. 1979 SA E Transactions 790465. Testing the Cone Brake Design. Morris E. Johnson, Transportation Marketing, United States Steel Corp. Several dynamometer tests of the Cone Brake design have been completed. These tests indicate that the Cone Brake offers improved performance, together with the oppor- tunity for weight and cost reduction. This paper reports the test results and discusses the advantages of the Cone Brake design. 790466. A New Concept in Aluminum Surface Protection. Pete Didrichsons, Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI. This paper describes a new technology developed for protecting bright aluminum surfaces. The technology involves a new highly inorganic material. This material is used to form a very clear, thin, and hard coating which protects an aluminum surface from a wide variety of environmental degradation. Data is presented illustrating the final protective properties of the coating material. Some comparisons are drawn with clear organic coatings and anodic finishes. The handling and application of the material is touched upon. 790467. Interfacial Features of Plated Aluminum Alloys. W. C. Cochran and R. A. Burns, Alcoa Labs., Alcoa Center, PA. A combination of electron microscopy and Auger depth profiling techniques was found useful in characterizing the interface zones of plated aluminum alloys. The pre- electroplating procedures examined were: zincate, Alcoa 661 Process, Alstan, and phosphoric acid anodizing. Good adhesion of electrodeposited nickel can be obtained on aluminum alloys. Failure of plated specimens in peel tests is by ductile fracture of the aluminum alloy substrate, except in the case of the anodic pretreatment where failure is principally through the oxide coating. To obtain best peel test results using the anodic pretreatment, the anodizing parameters must be tailored to the specific alloy that is to be plated. 790469. Light Metal Alloys Enhanced by a Family of Synergistic Coatings. Charles P. Covino, General Magnaplate Corp. New treatments for light metal alloys permit greater design and functional latitude for engineers in the automotive and transportation industries. Aerospace researchers, having pioneered a new series of coatings for aluminum called TUFRAM, for magnesium called MAGNADIZE and for titanium called CANADIZE, now are offering to heavy industries a wide range of coating types within each alloy grouping. 790476. Analysis of Crank Mechanism Brakes Supplied with an Integrated Automatic Slack Adjuster (Camph Brake Mechanism - CBM). Göran Gerbert, Machine Elements Div., Lund Tech- nical Univ. (Lund/Sweden). The paper describes and analyzes a newly developed brake mechanism supplied with an integrated automatic slack adjuster for heavy vehicles. The device is based on the crank mechanism principle. The geometric properties are examined and it is shown how some design parameters can be adjusted to meet specific requirements. The relation between applied torque and the brake torque is derived and in an example an inherent brake amplifi- cation property of the mechanism is shown. This property persists even when friction in the mechanism is consid- ered. The automatic adjusting system is travel sensing, so the relation between the travel of the sensing device and the clearance is analyzed. Finally, the amount of correc- tion of the clearance is treated and it is shown how the prescribed clearance can be maintained within very narrow limits. 790477. Small Engines-An Energy Perspective. L. A. McReynolds, 1978 SAE President. Because of the growth in world population and the need to improve living standards, world energy requirements will increase rapidly. A world energy shortage is expected to develop at least by 1990, and probably earlier. In supplying future energy needs, the world must shift from a predominantly petroleum-based economy to one which will phase in other energy sources. Actions have been taken in the United States to reduce the amount of energy used in transportation, one of the major energy consuming segments. There are an estimated 75 million small engines in use in the United States. The growth rate of small engines is expected to accelerate but they will continue to account for only a minor portion of total energy requirements. 790478. An Optimal Suspension for an Automobile on a Random Road. A. G. Thompson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Adelaide (South Australia); and C. E. M. Pearce, Dept. of Applied Mathematics, Univ. of Adelaide (South Australia). 81</page><page sequence="65">790480-790484 Optimal control theory is applied to the design of an active suspension system for a car on a random road. The performance index employed is a weighted sum of mean-squared values for the body forces, tyre dynamic deflections and relative wheel travels. The speed-depen- dent time delay between the road disturbance inputs is shown not to affect the optimal control law which is linear and time invariant. An explicit expression is obtained for the performance index. The practical realization of the optimal system is discussed and its characteristics com- pared with those of a conventional passive type suspen- sion system. 790480. Overview of Computer Technology. L. A. McReynolds, 1978 SAE President. In the last 25 years, dramatic advances have been made in computer technology. From 1952-1977 processing speed as measured in multiplications per second increased by a factor of 1500. Storage capacity per reel of tape has increased from 2.7 million characters to 106 million characters and the physical size of a million characters of memory has been reduced from 400 cubic feet to less than one cubic foot. Because the capabilities of small computers have increased and their cost has been reduced, their use will increase rapidly. Some applications should logically be done on a large central machine. Other applications are more suited to a small computer. A combination of the two provides a highly flexible system. The continuing rapid changes in computer technology make it necessary to plan carefully to avoid incompatible machines, incompatible data bases, and systems that will not adapt to changing needs. 790481. Worldwide Energy Situation - Impact on Com- mercial Vehicles. L. A. McReynolds, 1978 SAE President. The world consumption rate of oil is increasing so fast that the supply will not keep pace. During 1977, the world energy consumption exceeded 265 quadrillion BTUs - the equivalent of over 130 million barrels of oil per day. By the year 2000, world energy consumption is expected to more than double. Some time between 1980 and the turn of the century, world oil production will stop growing and slowly begin to shrink. The inescapable conclusion is that petroleum will not be able to maintain its share of the rapidly growing demand for energy. Recognizing that there is a close relationship between energy consumption and the performance of national economies, especially in industrialized nations, other fuels will be needed to meet growth demands. The world must shift from a predominantly petroleum-based economy to one which will phase in other energy sources, with increased emphasis on coal and nuclear power. This transition will require some complex decisions. Nations will have to choose more sparingly among alternative uses of the limited supplies of petroleum. One of the uses will be for commercial vehicles. However, the limited supplies and continuing higher prices will nec- essarily result in more fuel-efficient vehicles, more sophisticated bulk quantity delivery systems, and more consolidated production-delivery-marketing networks. 1979 SAE Transactions 790482. Automotive Materials - Past, Present and Future. Charles V. White, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., General Motors Inst., Flint, MI. Material usages from 1900 are traced with emphasis on introduction of new materials and alloys. The historic prospective taken also extrapolates current developmental trends into the future. The paper is divided into three periods - 1900-1940 - THE PAST, after World War II to 1978 - THE PRESENT, and THE FUTURE. The future segment examines questions to be considered by today's corrosion engineer for future developments and progress. 790483. Measurement of Local Mixture Strength at Spark Gap of S. I. Engines. Kazuma Matsui and Taro Tanaka, Nippon Soken, Inc.; and Shunichi Ohigashi, Kyoto Univ. In spark ignition engines, local fuel concentration of the mixture occupying the electrode spacing at the instant of spark discharge may be one of the important factors to dominate the combustion process and the cycle-by-cycle variation of combustion. To make clear the above problems, a special sampling device has been developed. The sampling valve is equipped with the central electrode of the spark plug, which enables us to sample the mixture formed near the electrode spacing of the spark plug in the ordinary engine operation. By applying this device, the mixture existing just before the occurrence of spark discharge can be taken repeatedly every cycle, and the cycle-by-cycle variation of mixture strength in the immediate vicinity of the electrode spacing was made clear. Further, it was found that the cycle-by-cycle variation of mixture strength formed in the electrode spacing at the instant of spark discharge increases by the engine operation with EGR. 1979 SAE Transactions 790484. An Analysis of the Volumetric Efficiency Char- acteristics of 4-Stroke Cycle Engines Using the Mean Inlet Mach Number Mim. Itaru Fukutani and Eiichi Watanabe, The Institute of Voca- tional Training (Japan). In order to obtain the limiting volumetric efficiency curve, the relationships between volumetric efficiency and engine speed were investigated on three engines by varying through wide limits the effective angle areas of the inlet valves. It was found that the mean inlet Mach number Mim introduced by the authors showed the characteristics of volumetric efficiency better than the inlet Mach index Ms 82</page><page sequence="66">790485-790491 widely used and when Mim approached Mim = 0.5, the flow around the inlet valve became critical causing inlet choking which made the volumetric efficiency decrease hyperbolically with an increase in engine speed. These phenomena were also observed in the test results of a Wankel type rotary engine. 1979 SA E Transactions 790485. Peak Value of Delivery Ratio in Two-Stroke Motorcycle Engine. Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ. (Japan); and Shigenobu Hayashi, Muroran Institute of Technology (Japan). Taking note of the value of the maximum delivery ratio Km produced by the inertia effect, the authors quali- tatively considered the influences of the atmospheric conditions and the engine factors to compare them with the experimental. It is ascertained that the value of maximum delivery ratio depends on the inertia effect and the theoretical results correspond fairly well with those of the experimental value. 790486. Two Stroke Gasoline Engine Having Small Toxic Emissions. Radislav Pavletič, Mechanical Engrg., Univ. Ljubljana (Yugoslavia). The new conception of the two stroke gasoline engine was tested on three experimental units. The characteristic feature for this conception is the scavenging of cylinder by clean air and internal formation of the mixture with a controlled blowing of the rich mixture into the cylinder. The rich mixture forms together with the residual air from scavenging an inflammable and combustible mixture. Design solutions are presented and analyzed from the point of view of experimental results. On the basis of these analyses, suggestions for further development of the engine are given, with the objective to attain the expected values of working and environmental contamination parameters of small two stroke gasoline engine that are presented in the conclusion of this paper. 790487. A New Method of Analyzing Two-Stroke Cycle Engine Gas Flow Patterns. Ramkrishna G. Phatak, Outboard Marine Corp. The study of scavenging flow is an important aspect in the porting development of two-cycle engines. The related flow visualization work is usually done with the help of model investigation. The present techniques use water, air, smoke, etc., as media and observations are either visual or photographic. In most cases, the equipment used is expensive and yet the data obtained is seldom complete. The purpose of this paper is to present a promising new method for scavenging evaluation. Use of Diazo paper and ammonia gas is envisaged for obtaining flow patterns. The method is fast, inexpensive, and reveals at least as much data as the present methods. The method as presented in this paper is in the preliminary state of development, but shows promise as a development tool. 1979 SA E Transactions 790489. Detection and Instrumental Analysis of Diesel Engine Exhaust Gas Odorants - A New Approach to an Old Problem. H. L. Daudel, M. J. Fieber, D. M. Murthy and H. O. Hardenberg, Daimler- Benz AG (Stuttgart/Germany). An advanced and highly efficient analytical procedure enables the detection, quantitative determination and clarification of the category and molecular structure of those odorants, which are responsible for the exhaust gas odor from internal combustion engines. In the foreseeable future this method will give the knowledge about the formation mechanism of odorants for the development of directive measures to reduce the formation of odorants or eliminating them. Furthermore, this procedure will help to determine which selected odorants groups should be measured to get a representative conclusion about exhaust gas odor. 1979 SA E Transactions 790490. Characterization of Heavy-Duty Diesel Gaseous and Particulate Emissions, and Effects of Fuel Composition. Charles T. Hare, Southwest Re- search Inst.; and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Gaseous and particulate emissions from two heavy-duty diesel engines were characterized while the engines were operated on five different fuels. Characterization included mass rates of major exhaust products, plus analysis of particulate matter for sulfate, trace elements, major elements, total solubles, and other properties. Analysis of rate and composition data was conducted with regard to fuel and engine effects on particulate. Two large particulate samples were also collected for later analysis on groups of organics present. 790491. A Study on the Time and Space Resolved Measurement of Flame Temperature and Soot Concentration in a D.I. Diesel Engine by the Two-Color Method. Yukio Matsui, Takeyuki Kamimoto and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Inst, of Technology. The two-color method regarding the visible wavelength radiation from soot particles in flames was closely studied in order to establish it as a measuring technique of the flame temperature and soot concentration in diesel engines. The accuracy of the temperature calibration of the measuring equipment was assured by a newly developed high temperature black body furnace and a standard tungsten lamp. The emissivity of diesel flames, which is the most important value in this method, was investigated through both the spectroscopic analysis of soot sampled from a diesel flame and the comparative measurements between the two-color method and the emission-absorp- tion method. The examined two-color method was applied to a direct injection diesel engine. The time and space resolved 83</page><page sequence="67">790492-790497 values of temperature and soot concentration were obtained for the first time. 1979 SA E Transactions 790492. Roadway Measurements of Diesel Exhaust Aer- osols. D. F. Dolan and D. B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Min- neapolis, MN. Physical characterization of the exhaust aerosols produced by two diesel-powered automobiles was done using the Mobile Air Pollution Laboratory (UMML) built by the University of Minnesota Particle Technology Laboratory. The two automobiles were a VW Rabbit and an Oldsmobile 5.7 liter V-8. Plume dilution ratios were measured using NOx as a tracer gas. Samples were taken in the exhaust plume at a point approximately one second after exhaust. The dilution ratios ranged from about 630 at idle to about 5000 at 80 km per hour. Experiments were performed at steady state road load only. Aerosol number, surface and volume concentration, and size distribution were measured using an electrical aerosol analyzer contained in the UMML. The total number concentration of submicron aerosol was measured using a condensation nuclei counter. Tailpipe number concentrations ranged from 2.4 X 108 to 2.2 X 109 par- ticles • cm-3. Volume concentrations ranged from 3 X 104 to 2.1 X 105 /xm3 • cm-3. The size distributions indicated a volume mean diameter of about 0.2 /xm. General characteristics of the roadway aerosol size distribution were similar to those measured when using a jet pump diluter in laboratory dynamometer studies. 790493. An Empirical Formula for Computing the Pres- sure Rise Delay of a Fuel from Its Cetane Number and from the Relevant Parameters of Direct-Injection Diesel Engines. H. O. Hardenberg and F. W. Hase, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart/Germany). The evaluation of test results from the development of a large number of direct-injection (DI) diesel engines of different design and a great variety of cylinder dimensions enabled an empirical formula to be derived which allows the effect of the fuel, the engine parameters and the ambient conditions on the pressure rise delay to be assessed. Application of the formula indicates the possibilities and limitations of minimising the pressure rise delay in naturally-aspirated (NA) and turbocharged (TC) diesel engines when operating on diesel fuel as well as on fuels of lower or higher ignition quality. 1979 SA E Transactions 790494. On the Dependence of Spray Angle and Other Spray Parameters on Nozzle Design and Oper- ating Conditions. R. D. Reitz and F. B. Bracco, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ. In the Atomization regime, liquid jets breakup either within the nozzle or immediately upon entering the chamber gas and drops much smaller than the jet diameter are formed. The mechanism of Atomization, which is presently unknown, was investigated by the simultaneous use of two photographic techniques. The initial transient was observed with a 106 frames/s camera and the steady state by a technique similar to spark photography. The experiment range was: liquid pressure 500 to 2500 psia; five mixtures of water and glycerol to vary the liquid viscosity; air, nitrogen, helium, and xenon at up to 600 psia as chamber gases to separate gas pressure from gas density effects; and 14 nozzle designs. Not changed were the temperature (room value), the nozzle diameter (340 /x), and the surface tension (70 dyne/cm). It was found that: jet divergence begins progressively closer to the nozzle exit as the gas density increases until it reaches the exit with no evidence of abrupt change; the divergence angle (spray angle) increases with increasing gas density, and sharpness of nozzle inlet and with decreasing liquid viscosity and nozzle length; divergence angle and jet intact length are quasi-steady with respect to upstream pressure changes which occur on time scales greater than 10 to 30 /xs; aerodynamic effects, liquid turbulence, jet velocity profile rearrangments, and liquid pressure oscillations, each could not alone be the mech- anism of atomization; cavitation or aerodynamic effects, supplemented by cavitation and/or wall boundary layer relaxation processes, could each be the mechanism of atomization; and the criterion Weg &gt; 40.3 for the onset of atomization and a commonly used gas jet expression to predict the spray divergence angle are inadequate. Equations are given for the divergence angle and the onset of atomization which are valid within the tested range. 790496. Diesel Precombustion Chamber Design and Its Influence on the Engine Performance and Ex- haust Pollutants. R. S. Radovanovic, Cummins Engine Co.; and M. S. Djordjevic, Univ. of Alabama. One-cylinder Lister SRI, four-stroke, air-cooled engine, with direct injection was redesigned and reworked into an indirect injection engine - precombustion chamber type. Basic design features and the limitation of the test head and of the precombustion chamber in particular are described. Fifteen different prechambers were tested; the results are presented and discussed. A correlation of the prechamber design parameters such as ratio of height to diameter; number, size, downward and spread angle of connecting passageways; and ratio of prechamber volume to total compression volume has been made with engine performance and exhaust pollutants. 1979 SA E Transactions 790497. Strategy for Development of Vehicle Electronic Systems Diagnostics. J. B. King, Electrical and 84</page><page sequence="68">790498-790503 Electronics Division, Ford Motor Company. The automotive industry is presently experiencing a rapid escalation in the use of electronic components for the control of vehicle functions. The service environment in the dealerships have, at the same time, been relatively unchanged with little emphasis upon developing expertise in servicing these electronic systems. This circumstance has brought about increased customer dissatisfaction due to the incidence of alleged over-repair work and the number of "repeat repairs." As electronic components become more numerous and also as the functions being controlled increase in complexity, it is imperative that diagnostics be developed to support these sophisticated electronic systems at product introduction. Successful implementation and deployment of such diagnostics can best be accomplished if product design and diagnostic development occur concurrently. This study presents some of the issues that the current service environment faces and describes our strategy for developing and implementing diagnostics for future electronic systems. 790498. The Effect of Part Proliferation on Assembly Line Operators' Decision Making Capabilities. Susanne M. Gatchell, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. In order to quantify the effects of part proliferation on assembly line operators' decision making capabilities, a research study was conducted. Using a Choice Reaction Time technique, 16 operators were tested to determine their reaction times and error rates when selecting parts. These operators were from four training levels (trained, relief, untrained/job and untrained/plant) and had to decide between 4, 7 or 10 major parts. Results show that operators with 10 parts made 46% more errors and needed 13% more decision time than operators with 4 parts. Furthermore, the relief and untrained/job operators made three times more errors than the trained operators. The untrained/plant operators had over five times more errors than the trained operators. These results indicate that all operators could make a selection when working with 10 major parts. However, their reaction times and error rates increased as the number of parts increased from 4 to 10. 1979 SA E Transactions 790499. Microcomputer - Simplifying Sophistication. Don Folkes, Mostek Corp. On-board microcomputer systems in automobiles have become a fact of life for the automotive industry. Because of strict requirements on emissions and fuel economy imposed by the federal government, and to meet the increasing demands of consumers for sophisticated driver assistance controls and displays, the automotive industry has turned to microcomputers to perform these complex functions. This paper will use the Mostek MK3870 family of Microcomputers to illustrate the sophistication of "State of the Art" MOS LSI and automotive applications of this technology. 790501. Active Thermo- Atmosphere Combustion (AT AC) - A New Combustion Process for Inter- nal Combustion Engines. Shigeru Onishi, Souk Hong Jo, Katsuji Shoda, Pan Do Jo and Satoshi Kato, Nippon Clean Engine Research Institute Co., Ltd. A new lean combustion process for internal combustion engines has been developed. This newly devised combus- tion system, designated as "Active Thermo-Atmosphere Combustion" (AT AC), differs from conventional gasoline and diesel engine combustion processes. AT AC can be applied most easily to two-stroke cycle gasoline engines. Stable combustion can be achieved with lean mixtures at part- throttle operation. With AT AC the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of two-stroke cycle spark-ignition engines are remarkably improved, and noise and vibration are reduced. 1979 SA E Transactions 790502. (P-80) Application of Acoustic Intensity Meas- urement to Engine Noise Evaluation. J. Y. Chung, J. Pope and D. A. Feldmaier, Fluid Dynamics Research Department, General Mo- tors Research Laboratories, Warren, Michigan. This paper is concerned with the application to engine noise analysis of a cross-spectral method of measuring acoustic intensity recently developed at the General Motors Research Laboratories. The effectiveness and practicality of the approach is demonstrated in a series of tests conducted with a naturally-aspirated, two-stroke V-8 diesel engine. A rapid space-time averaging technique for determining the sound power radiated by sections of different engine components is demonstrated, as well as detailed mappings of noise emission by the engine surface. Noise-source ranking of engine components is performed based on intensity measurements made at the engine surface, and the total engine sound power is determined by summing these individual contributions. The sound power determined at the engine surface in this way is compared with estimates of engine sound power based on acoustic intensity measurements made both over a spherical surface and a set of planar surfaces enclosing the engine. Agreement to within 0.1 dB and 0.5 dB respec- tively is obtained. This close agreement is a good indication of the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the acoustic intensity method. 790503. Improved Methods for Fastening Steel Parts in Aluminum Housings. Richard T. Thompson, Loctite Corp., Newington, CT. Whenever steel parts are pressed or fastened into alu- minum, differential thermal expansion must be a prime consideration for maintaining the assembly. The author illustrates that elevated temperature adhesive bonding can 85</page><page sequence="69">790505-790511 give integrity of assembly exceeding press fits, shrink fits and loose adhesive fits. The performance of interference fits is compared to adhesive bonded joints under various operating condi- tions. 790505. Mobilization of Worker Potential in the Japanese Auto Industry. Robert E. Cole, Dept. of Soci- ology, The Univ. of Michigan. This paper considers U.S. management philosophy in the auto industry as it impacts on the strategy for improving quality control practices. We find that existing practices often have consequences contrary to intended goals. These practices are contrasted to those operative in the Japanese auto industry. General background factors influencing the Japanese approach as well as a specific description of quality control practices in the Japanese auto industry are introduced. We describe the Quality Control Circles operative in Japanese auto firms. The ways in which these circles contribute to the mobilization of worker potential is described. The original research described here was conducted at Toyota Auto Body. 1979 SA E Transactions 790506. (P-80) A Review of Basic Design Principles for Low-Noise Diesel Engines. Gerhard E. Thien, AVL Prof. List Ges.m.b.H., Graz, Austria. In accordance with the main efforts of research and development in noise control of diesel engines measures which are essential for a noise reduction of more than 10 dB(A) and results achieved with an advanced direct injection combustion system are described. In general the noise of external engine parts can be reduced to a large extent only by vibration isolation or sound reducing shells. Considering economic aspects the attenuation of the total engine noise by more than 10 dB(A) requires a complete encapsulation of the engine which can with newly designed engines at least be partly integrated into the engine structure. Outgoing from some fundamentals about sound reducing shells the different approaches for low noise engines based on these principles and developed in the last decade are discussed. Specific measures applied with the advanced D.I. combustion system are discussed resulting, in comparison with optimized I.D.I, combustion systems, in equivalent exhaust emission, acceptable combustion noise and, regarding small diesel engines, in the same power output and speed maintaining the big advantage in fuel consumption. 790507. Spark Discharge as a Source of Electromagnetic Pulse Waves. Hans Neu, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart/West Germany). Recent investigations into the breakdown mechanisms of ignition sparks have shown that the equivalent circuit diagrams used commonly until now to describe the associated transient processes need to be refined. The new results lead to a formulation of 4 requirements for optimum suppression. Suppression devices designed ac- cordingly guarantee interference-free operation of elec- tronic systems in motor vehicles and conform to the legal requirements for electromagnetic interference in the frequency range between 30 and 1000 MHz. 790508. The Microcomputer Based Engine Control Sys- tem for the IIEC-2 Concept Car. A. L. Cederquist, S. S. Devlin, D. L. Hart and R. Moon, Ford Motor Co. The microcomputer based ignition timing, EGR and fuel injection control system for the IIEC-2 concept vehicle is described. The techniques used to compensate the fuel delivery for EGR, to minimize response time and to compensate for engine and injector non-uniformity are emphasized. These measures, in conjucntion with limit cycle air/fuel ratio control utilizing feedback from an exhaust gas oxygen sensor, are examined with respect to the effect on three-way catalyst performance. 1979 SA E Transactions 790510. Maximizing Dozer Work Rate with Draft Power Sensing Systems. J. M. Goris, Spokane Mining Research Center, USBM; and H. S. Benson, Southwest Research Inst. A majority of coal strip mine reclamation is done with bulldozers. In this work large quantities of earth are relocated with little need for adherence to precise grade or contour. Maximum possible bulldozer work effort is required for minimum fuel usage and cost per yard of soil moved. In response to the need for bulldozer work optimization, Southwest Research Institute, in coopera- tion with the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the Department of Energy, has developed and successfully field tested a draft power sensor (DPS) system. Reclamation leveling of over 120 acres of strip mine spoil has verified a work production improvement of up to 25 percent with DPS usage. In operation, the DPS measures bulldozer true ground speed (velocity) by ultrasonic doppler means, and draft force by means of a strain gage on the dozer blade push-arm trunnion. When electrical signals proportional to draft and velocity are electronically multiplied, the resultant draft power product represents the real work rate actually being applied to the soil. By adjusting the dozer blade to maximize his draft power indication, the operator maximizes the bulldozer work rate. 790511. Fatigue Crack Initiation and Growth Analysis for Structures. D. Broek and B. N. Leis, Battelle's Columbus Labs., Columbus, OH. This paper presents a summary of the recent develop- ments in fatigue analysis. It is pointed out that fatigue is a consequence of cyclic plasticity and that local stress and strain provide the parameters for fatigue damage analysis. Fatigue analysis of structural components is discussed and the similitude requirements to enable life predictions on 86</page><page sequence="70">790513-790520 the basis of laboratory data from small specimens are elaborated upon. As fatigue consists of crack nucleation and propagation, the problem of crack growth prediction is briefly reviewed as well. The paper closes with some examples of application of the analysis techniques to weldments. 1979 SAE Transactions 790513. Shot Peening - An Added Dimension. F. K. Baldauf, Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc. Shot Peening is a practical and useful process that is widely used to improve the quality of metal parts and structures. The equipment required, and the measurement of the peening conditions, are easily handled by factory per- sonnel. The results of peening are often quite dramatic, and are indicated by fatigue testing of the part, and by laboratory analysis of the residual level of compressive forces present in a peened part. 790514. The Allocation of Time and Effort for Engi- neering Managers. Dale Jackson, Univ. of Missouri. Two, broad, alternative philosophies are described for engineering managers who wish to improve the per- formance of their subordinates. Each of those alternatives is subdivided into more specific courses of action. Those actions are characterized according to their probable effects on the attitudes and responses of subordinates. Contributions are taken from transactional analysis, effectiveness training, nonverbal communication and positive reinforcement. 790515. Operational Aids for Improved Dragline Utili- zation. A. E. Szczuka, McDonnell Douglas Electronics Co., St. Charles, MO; and H. B. Reese, Div. of Solid Fuels Mining and Prepa- ration, Dept. of Energy, Washington, DC. An on-board dragline display and information gathering system was developed to generate and display to the operator performance information pertaining to the dragline operation. This is feedback information for use in skill improvement and procedural aids. The system is also used to store information including data entered by the operator for later printout. The prototype system was initially developed under a contract with the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Department of Energy. The system was evaluated on an operating dragline. Production design has been completed and the first production system is operational in the field. 790516. Fracture Toughness and Fatigue Evaluation of Mild Steel Castings. Gary Mauritzson, John Deere Dubuque Works. Fatigue crack initiation, propagation, and critical fracture of cast steel components subjected to variable amplitude loading are investigated in this study. Predictive tech- niques that have been used and appear to be applicable to wrought steels are analyzed to evaluate their accuracy with a cast steel. Predictions of crack initiation life, crack propagation life, fracture toughness, and critical crack size were compared to laboratory test results for SAE 0030 mild cast steel. The values of fracture toughness will vary as temperature changes. A fracture toughness value measured at one temperature was related to Charpy energies over a large temperature range to quantify the variation in fracture toughness. This method would ease the design and evaluation of fracture resistant parts. 790517. Low Temperature Fatigue Behavior of Steels - A Review. R. I. Stephens and J. H. Chung, The Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; and G. Glinka, The Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA (On leave from Warsaw Technical Univ., Warsaw/ Poland). This paper consists of a comprehensive literature review of constant amplitude fatigue behavior at low temperatures in steels. S-N, low cycle c-N, and fatigue crack growth da/dN results are included. Unnotched, notched and cracked specimen fatigue behavior is presented. In many cases the constant amplitude fatigue resistance is en- hanced at low temperatures. A sufficient number of situations exist, however, to indicate this is not always true. Poor low temperature fatigue behavior in steel is usually due to a change from ductile to brittle fatigue mechanisms. A fatigue transition temperature which can be significantly different than NDT values exists in may steels. 1979 SAE Transactions 790519. Fatigue Properties of Welded Roller-Quenched and Tempered (RQ) Steels. Harold S. Reemsnyder, Fatigue and Fracture Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp. Axial fatigue tests were performed on unwelded and welded roller-quenched and tempered carbon and alloy steels. The effects of stress ratio, weld geometry, base metal tensile strength, and weld-peening on the fatigue resistance of submerged-arc transverse butt welds in 3/4-inch-thick (19.1 mm) plates were studied. The fatigue resistance of welded constructional steels with reinforce- ment intact was practically independent of tensile strength and stress ratio at lives greater than 200,000 cycles. Removal of reinforcement restored the pulsating tension fatigue strength to that of the unwelded material at lives greater than 400,000 cycles. 1979 SAE Transactions 790520. A Numerical Method for Predicting the Large Deflection Response of Cab Windows. Richard C. Coddington, John Deere Dubuque Works. Three nonlinear finite element models were developed for prediction of the large deflection response of cab windows 87</page><page sequence="71">790521-790527 made from polycarbonate thermoplastic. Excellent cor- relation existed between deflections measured in the laboratory and those predicted for two of the models developed. As a result, use of these models provides the design engineer the opportunity to select the best design alternative prior to laboratory testing per SAE J 1084. 790521. The Mark V STAM - A Microcomputer for Acquiring Field Data. R. L. Decker, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State Univ., Stillwater, OK. The Statistical Analog Monitor (STAM) was developed by the Fluid Power Research Center to gather information about the operational severity of hydraulic systems operating in the field. A new device, the Mark V STAM, has been designed using a single-chip microcomputer. This device promises to provide more accurate data and new flexibilities in configuring tests. This paper discusses the STAM concept and the theory of operation of the Mark V STAM hardware. The application of the STAM is illustrated with actual results from a vehicle operated in three different conditions. 1979 SAE Transactions 790522. Description of a Data Logger/ Analysis Field Test System. Willie J. Culpepper, John Deere Prod- uct Engrg. Center. As the design of vehicles becomes increasingly optimized, designers and test engineers have a greater requirement for long-term load histories under typical field conditions. To meet this need, a new user-oriented data log- ging/analyzer system has been assembled. The CR5 data logger is capable of time-scaled integrating twelve chan- nels, with low power consumption. The unit is designed for installation on moving vehicles. The data logger provides signal conditioning for frequency, temperatures, and strain gage bridge input signals; and records the integrated data values on cassette tape. The data are transferred from cassette to an H-P 9825A calculator via an RS-232 interface. Data analysis and plotting programs have been written to display the results. This paper is a discussion of the data logger/analyzer and test results using the system. 790524. New John Deere Industrial Transmission. J. R. Harvey, John Deere Product Engineering Cen- ter, Waterloo, Iowa. This paper describes some of the design criteria, major components, unique features, hydraulic circuitry, and durability testing used to develop a new power shift transmission for the JD844 Front End Loader. The planetary pack with four forward and three reverse speeds, drop train gears, output shaft with a parking collar and hydraulic valving were designed to fulfill the JD844 requirements. High torque and energy capacity along with a new pressure modulating valve provides smooth and rapid shuttle shifting from this transmission at full power, which is vital to the productivity of the JD844 Loader. Extensive laboratory, dynamometer, and field testing has proven the performance and reliability of the JD844 Loader transmission. 790525. New Bearing Selection Concepts and Mounting Guidelines for Off-Highway Wheels. Brian J. Cave and Ravi R. Bhatia, The Timken Co. Increased size, pay load and horsepower requirements are the trend in today's off-highway industry. This paper discusses the role of new anti-friction roller bearing technology in avoiding problems created by changing design considerations and the performance/cost/EPA triad currently squeezing designers and manufacturers of rubber tired earthmoving machinery. A comparison is made of bearing fatigue life deter- mined by several methods including those derived from vehicle instrumentation and purely empirical criteria. Some common problems relating to the mounting and set up of large wheel bearings are also reviewed together with corresponding remedies. 1979 SAE Transactions 790526. Tire Options and Consequences for Four-Wheel Drive Tractors. James H. Taylor, Eddie C. Burt and Alvin C. Bailey, National Tillage Machinery Lab., SEA-AR, USDA. Some general principles have been developed that will assist operators in the selection of tire and wheel equipment. Traction performance is enhanced by tire configurations which give long, narrow footprints in the direction of travel. This may be accomplished in several ways: tracks, tandem drive wheels, increasing diameter, or radial ply construction. A system of traffic control that can save tillage energy is discussed, and the effect of total load on soil compaction is shown. 1979 SAE Transactions 790527. Hydrostatics on Vehicles - Controlling and Sizing for Productivity. Gian Luca Zarotti, CEMOTER, Earthmoving Research Center (Torino/Italy); and Nicola Nervegna, Istituto di Macchine, Politecnico di Torino. The paper contributes to the analysis of hydrostatic vehicles looking at controlling and sizing aspects in terms of productivity goals. Three significant stages are devel- oped: (1) an open circuit hydrostatic transmission model with a variable displacement pump actuating two fixed displacement motors; (2) a tracked vehicle locomotion model interfacing transmission and soil characteristics; (3) a comprehensive evaluation of the system behaviour based on the "overall productivity efficiency". Produc- tivity concepts are considered as useful yardsticks to decide on optimal sizing and controls of transmission and vehicle components under specific constraints. Compu- tational case-studies, based on a conversational program, 88</page><page sequence="72">790528-790535 are described to illustrate applications and potentials of this approach. 1979 SA E Transactions 790528. An Earthmoving Equipment Management Policy. Gilbert W. Gray, Murphy Brothers, Inc., Spokane, WA. Key elements of an equipment management policy which has been used by a successful earthmoving contractor are discussed in this paper. The author emphasizes that similar principles are used by most successful earthmoving contractors, and should be incorporated in a policy by large businesses or government agencies that become involved in earthmoving operations. Included is a dis- cussion of size of fleet, operating and maintenance policies, record keeping, and replacement programs with a detailed presentation of the key factors in deciding to purchase or lease equipment. Specific items such as financial considerations, annual usage expected, dealer availability, operating and maintenance personnel, stan- dardization, obsolescence, total cost, and social factors are discussed. 790529. Attachments - A Unique Approach to Flexibility. D. L. Spanjer, Massey-Ferguson Ltd. Construction equipment as supplied from the factory is usually suitable for 40 to 70% of the spectrum of applications. A broad range of attachments is required to achieve optimum flexibility and to approach 100% capability utilization. Full line manufacturers and those selling into world markets cannot supply this broad range and must rely on allied equipment manufacturers to fill the gap. To ensure that the basic equipment is correctly used, they must monitor and communicate the availability of many different attachments and educate their staff, dealers and customers to enable them to make the best selection. 1979 SA E Transactions 790530. Ripping - Today and Tommorrow. Roger L. Sprenkel, American Tractor Equipment Corp. The improvements in the designs of the rippers and the prime movers that pull them have been predicated on the need to reduce cost per yard of moving or processing material. This paper outlines the progression of design im- provements in rippers, including some new innovations that are just coming into the market and a rationale for these designs. 790531. The Caterpillar 980C Wheel Loader. Thomas E. Cochran, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new Caterpillar Wheel Loader has been developed as a replacement for the 980B. This paper explains the vehicle design objectives, summarizes the development program, and provides a comprehensive review of the major features of the 980C Wheel Loader. 790532. A New John Deere Four Wheel Drive Loader. C. W. Von Fumetti, John Deere Dubuque Works. John Deere recently introduced the JD844 Four Wheel Drive Loader. As one of the largest John Deere industrial units, many new components were required. The descrip- tion and reasons for selection of these components are discussed. Included are new features to increase produc- tivity, operator comfort, and serviceability. A "complete hydraulic system" laboratory durability test is also discussed. 790533. Applying an Auxiliary Drive System to Earth- moving Equipment for Increased Productivity. John I. Henn, John Deere Dubuque Works. The productivity of mobile industrial equipment can be increased by applying an auxiliary drive system to non-powered wheels, especially where tractive conditions are limited or variable. A unique auxiliary drive system has been applied to the front wheels of John Deere motor graders to increase tractive effort and directional stability. The system is hydraulically-driven and electronically- controlled and could be applied to several types of mobile industrial equipment. 790534. Asphalt Recycling of Pavements. James A. Burton, The Asphalt Inst. Described are the reasons for consideration of recycling for deteriorated pavements, saliently economy, and itemized are some pavements suitable for recycling. Also discussed are the advantages of recycling, with emphasis upon enhancement of structural strength. Mentioned are three main categories of recycling: hot recycling, cold recycling, and surface recycling, together with variations in the equipment and methods used in the latter category. Examples of successful recycling projects in Iowa, Oregon, and Minnesota are described, including the upgrading of shoulders on the Interstate system. The Federal Highway Administration's commitment to recycling is exemplified by reference to a Region 9 directive. 790535. Hot Process Recycling of Asphalt Pavement Materials - State-of-the-Art. R. W. Beaty and L. V. Binz, Barber-Greene Co., Aurora, IL. Continuously increasing costs of roadbuilding materials have generated considerable interest in reclaiming and reprocessing of existing asphalt pavement materials. Reprocessing of this reclaimed asphalt coated material cannot be accomplished with totally conventional asphalt hot mixing equipment without the production of "blue smoke". This paper details several processes used in the industry during the past two years to recycle asphalt pavement without formation of the objectionable smoke using conventional asphalt mixing equipment with some modifications. These processes involve various approaches to heating the reclaimed asphaltic material by blending it 89</page><page sequence="73">790536-790561 with overheated new aggregate and by direct contact with low temperature combustion gases. 1979 SA E Transactions 790536. Recycling - The Key to Future Road Mainte- nance Through Reclamation and Reprocessing of the World's Existing Pavements. Richard E. Lowell, CMI Corp., Oklahoma City, OK. A discussion of the overall economics and reasons for consideration of reclamation and reprocessing of existing pavements. This paper will explore the potential economic value attributed to the above in light of current and future values and supplies of natural resources - specifically natural aggregates and petroleum products. Discussed will be three main categories: profiling for surface restoration and increased safety factors on existing pavements; reclamation of materials from existing pave- ments; and the recycling of reclaimed material for usage on existing pavements for the upgrading of these pave- ments as well as usage for the reconstruction of badly deteriorated pavements. The paper discusses the various techniques available as well as the current state-of-the-art, and a look at the future in this segment of the road construction and maintenance industry. 790537. Design of a Self Loading Scraper with Stationary Bowl Floor and Liftable Elevator. Richard F. Boersma, Product Engrg. - Tractor Scrapers, Fiat-AUis CMI. A new concept self loading scraper with a semi-floating liftable elevator has been developed which ejects material over the front of a full-length stationary bowl floor and cutting blade. Automatic elevator lift is accomplished by hydraulic pressure bleed-off from the two stage ejector circuit while unloading, and allows material to flow freely over the front of the cutting blade at desired spread thickness. 790538. Development of Off-Highway Articulated Dump Trucks. D. J. B. Brown and R. J. Heather, D.J.B. Engineering Ltd. Articulated dump trucks have developed along a multi- plicity of lines for diverse applications and reasons. Past, present and future developments and applica- tions are reviewed, including the Author's experiences in the development of DJB articulated trucks. Some of the major design features reviewed include suspension, tires, weight distribution, stability and manoeuvrability, to- gether with mechanical and operational comparisons with other hauling systems. 790539. "The Middle Man". Charlie Kearns, Kearns Machinery Co., Sioux Falls, SD. The "middle man" in the construction machinery business is the dealer who sells and services the products designed and built by the engineers and scientists of the industry. Quality is a foremost concern of the dealer and second, only to quality, is the need for cost control. 790560. Lessons Learned from PABST. R. W. Shannon, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Long Beach, CA. The adhesive selection and surface treatment investi- gations for the Primary Adhesively Bonded Structures Technology (PABST) Program, Air Force contract F33615-75-C-3016, include several tests for environmental resistance and durability. During the performance of these tests, several lessons were learned about the characteristics of behavior of the adhesives, surface treatments, and the resultant bonded structure. The surface treatments proved to be fragile and easily damaged and contaminated when not protected by an adhesive primer system. Not all surface treatment systems provide an optimum envi- ronment resistance when processed in a normal produc- tion facility. The type of carrier used in the adhesive affects the durability of the system. Constant and cycled-stressed testing of adhesive-bonded specimens in an environment can define adhesive characteristics and bond line properties better than static unstressed expo- sure. Tests include wedge crack, lap shear, and double cantilever beam. Lap shear tests included stressed, cycle stressed, and nonstressed. The environments include 140° F and 100 percent relative humidity (RH), hydraulic oil, JP-4, water, salt spray, and beach atmosphere exposure. 790561. Bonding and Durability. A. C. Fehrle and R. L. McDougal, Lockheed-Georgia Co., Marietta, GA. This paper presents the development of adhesive bonded structure as its use has steadily increased and discusses its relationship to improved structural durability. Also described is the evolution of bonding materials and processes and their extensive usage in three generations of cargo aircraft. Recent research and development work related to fatigue crack growth retardation has been accomplished. The approaches investigated provide life improvement to structures designed to the criteria spec- ified in MIL-STD-1530 and MIL-A-83444. Data have been generated to demonstrate the compatibility of bonded structure and the fatigue enhancement joining techniques of interference-fit fasteners or cold working of fastener holes. New generation adhesive systems are also providing improved durability to adverse environments and have shown applicability to bonding metals or composites. The big payoff for these advancements in bonding technology is that more durable airframe struc- ture can be built at little or no weight penalty while meeting the durability and damage tolerance criteria imposed by the new Military Standards and Specifica- tions. The approved construction methods will find their way into commercial and general aviation aircraft as the 90</page><page sequence="74">790562-790569 extensive testing to establish their safety is completed and the improved economics is demonstrated. 790562. Quality Control of Adhesive Bonding. M. W. Heimerdinger, Los Angeles Div., Rockwell In- ternational Corp. The quality control of adhesive bonded panels begins with the arrival of the adhesive system at the fabricating facility. Whether an adhesive must be kept refrigerated or stored at room temperature, its quality must be verified and maintained until it is cured in a bonded assembly. Panel detail prefit, surface preparation, curing tempera- ture, and pressure must all be maintained within pre- scribed parameters to obtain part quality. The utilization of process verification coupons adds assurance of correct processing and verifies the strength of the bond assembly. Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) is a valuable tool used to provide final assurance of correct processing. NDI comes in many shapes, and selection of the method to be employed must be given careful consideration. Under- inspection can make the assemblies' cost prohibitive. A few of the methods available will be discussed from visual inspection to ultrasonic through transmission with "C" scan recordings. 790563. Adhesive Bonded Structure of New Pressurized Piston Twin Aircraft. Akitoshi Nagao, Takeshi Nakao and Kenichiro Usuki, Fuji Heavy Indus- tries Ltd. Adhesively bonded structures, that is, metal to metal bonding of cabin and wing skin and honeycomb sandwich panel of pressure bulkhead, are used in newly developed general aviation pressurized piston twin aircraft, Rockwell/Fuji Model 700. This paper presents the design consideration of each bonded structure showing the advantages of bonding, and its quality control procedure used in subject aircraft. 790564. Effects of a Spin Chute Installation on Spin Characteristics. John D. Patrick, Piper Aircraft Corp. Data extracted from certification spin testing on a light general aviation training airplane was examined for differences in recovery characteristics that could be assigned to the spin chute installation. Several center of gravity and rudder surface positions were tested. Both normal spins and spins with aileron misuse were evalu- ated. 790565. Spin Flight Research Summary. James M. Patton, Jr., H. Paul Stough III and Daniel J. Dicarlo, NASA, Langley Research Center. An extensive general aviation stall/spin research program is underway at the NASA Langley Research Center. Flight tests have examined the effects of tail design, wing leading edge design, mass distribution, and minor air- frame modifications on spin and recovery characteristics. Results and observations on test techniques are presented for the first airplane in the program. Configuration changes produced spins varying from easily recoverable slow, steep spins to unrecoverable, fast flat spins. 1979 SAE Transactions 790567. Conversion of Wing Surface Pressures Into Normalized Lift Coefficient. Arthur W. Hoadley, Dept. of Transportation Technology, Western Michigan Univ. A normalized lift coefficient indicator has been developed for single-engine aircraft. The system developed incor- porates a low-cost capacitance type pressure transducer and an electronic circuit to calculate the wing pressure coefficient. The system eliminates the need for probes protruding from the aircraft's wing by using two flush pressure taps on the wing surface and the aircraft's static pressures. The pressure taps have been located so as to produce a normalized lift coefficient display that is nearly linear, independent of flap setting, and independent of thrust. The system gives the aircraft's proximity to a stall condition regardless of its load factor, weight, or config- uration. The preceding should reduce the fatal stall/spin accidents that are one of the foremost killers in general aviation. 1979 SAE Transactions 790568. The Effects of Low-Level Wind Shear on the Approach and Go-Around Performance of a Landing Jet Aircraft. R. A. Greene, Safe Flight Instrument Corp. The recent recognition of severe low-level wind shear (wind directional/velocity change with respect to distance and/or time) has engendered considerable discussion within the performance engineering and flight operations committee. Government-sponsored research has focused on piloting techniques to penetrate and, in instances of great variations in wind component over short periods or compressed boundaries, avoid air masses of different horizontal magnitudes. This paper outlines the devel- opment of an airborne system which evaluates the additional excess performance required to overcome the effects of both horizontal shear encounters and down- drafts. The data indicate that the early rapid detection of the sum of the two orthogonal vectors of a severe encounter will significantly improve the go-around profile and thus recovery opportunities. 1979 SAE Transactions 790569. A Demonstration Advanced Avionics System for General Aviation. D. G. Denery, G. P. Callas, C. T. Jackson, B. K. Berkstresser and G. H. Hardy, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, California. The Ames Research Center initiated a program in 1975 to provide the critical information required for the design of integrated avionics suitable for general aviation. The 91</page><page sequence="75">790570-790578 program has emphasized the use of data busing, dis- tributed microprocessors, shared electronic displays and data entry devices, innovative low-cost sensors, and improved functional capability. Design considerations include cost, reliability, maintainability, and modularity. As a final step, a demonstration advanced avionics system is being designed, fabricated, and flight tested. The purpose of this paper is to provide a functional description of the Demonstration Advanced Avionics System in- cluding a description of the system architecture in order to document the direction that the program is taking. 790570. Electronic System Safety - Testing Reality. G. L. Neal, General Aviation Flight Control Engrg., Collins Avionics. It is the purpose of this paper to sensitize the business aircraft community to some subtleties of aircraft elec- tronic system safety concepts. Suggestions of what to look for and how to test for reality will be made. The near-term future of business aviation will see a deluge of new gadgets. The end customer can enforce either a climate of real professional values or blatant disregard for appro- priate system concepts by his actions. Informed and careful selection of equipment and installations can successfully guide the rapidly expanding aircraft elec- tronics systems industry to policies that will increase safety and performance for the end customer. 790573. Wind Tunnel Performance of Four Energy Effi- cient Propellers Designed for Mach 0.8 Cruise. Robert J. Jeracki, Daniel C. Mikkelson and Bernard J. Blaha, National Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lewis Research Center, Cleve- land, OH. The increased emphasis on fuel conservation has stimu- lated a renewed interest in turboprop powered aircraft. Recent studies by NASA and industry indicate that fuel savings from 15 to 30 percent at Mach 0.8 may be realized by the use of an advanced high-speed turboprop, and over 20% at Mach 0.7 typical of business jet aircraft. This aircraft must be capable of high efficiency at Mach 0.8 cruise above 9.144 km (30,000 ft) altitude if it is to compete with turbofan powered aircraft. In the past, propellers were highly efficient at cruise speeds up to approximately Mach 0.6. However, above this speed, large compressibility losses on the propeller blading caused the efficiency to fall rapidly. If these losses are to be overcome, new design concepts will have to be developed for advanced high-speed propellers. Several advanced aerodynamic and acoustic concepts were investigated in recent wind tunnel tests performed in the NASA-Lewis Research Center 8x6 foot wind tunnel. These concepts included aerodynamically integrated propeller/nacelles, area-ruling, blade sweep, reduced blade thickness, and power (disk) loadings several times higher than conven- tional designs. Four eight-bladed propeller models were tested to determine aerodynamic performance. Relative noise measurements were made on three of the models at cruise conditions. Three of the models were designed with swept blades and one with straight blades. At the design Mach number of 0.8, power coefficient of 1.7, and advance ratio of 3.06, the straight bladed model had the lowest net efficiency of 75.8%. Increasing the sweep to 30° improved the performance to near 77%. Installation of an area-ruled spinner on a 30° sweep model further improved the efficiency to about 78%. The model with the highest blade sweep (45°) and an area-ruled spinner had the highest net efficiency of 78.7%, and at lower power loadings the efficiency exceeded 80%. At lower Mach numbers the 30° swept model had the highest efficiency. Values near 81% were obtained for the design loading at speeds to Mach 0.7. Relative noise measurements indi- cated that the acoustically designed 45° sweep model reduced the near field cruise noise by between 5 and 6 dB. 790575. The Design and Selection of Optimum Propellers for General Aviation Aircraft. Henry V. Borst, Henry V. Borst &amp; Assoc. Using the latest available methods and data for designing propeller blades and determining performance, a study of the general aviation propellers installations is given. In this study four general aviation aircraft are considered covering the range of speed and power encountered in this field. Propellers typical of those currently being used are considered and their performance is calculated and compared with the ideal to find the efficiency improve- ments that might be possible. A study for the aircraft considered showed that new propellers can be designed that will have improved performance that approaches that of the ideal or opti- mum. The use of the new computer generated airfoils was also considered in the design of new propellers with promising results. 790576. The Analysis of Propellers Including Interaction Effects. B. W. McCormick, A. S. Aljabri, S. J. Jumper and Z. N. Martinovic, Dept. of Aero- space Engrg., The Pennsylvania State Univ. Analytical and experimental studies have been under- taken on propellers operating in the unsteady flow field produced by interaction effects due to the fuselage, wing, and nacelles. Methods have been developed and verified experimentally for determining the velocity field in which a propeller operates as well as its aerodynamic and dynamic response to this unsteady environment. Methods are presented for predicting the net thrust of a propeller- wing-body combination as well as the unsteady thrust and torque acting on the propeller. Sample calculations as well as wind tunnel and flight test results are presented which illustrates the sensitivity of a propeller to the flow field in which it is operating. 1979 SA E Transactions 790578. Composite Applications at Bell Helicopter. O. K. 92</page><page sequence="76">790579-790585 McCaskill, Jr., Bell Helicopter Textron. Bell Helicopter Textron has used fiber reinforced plastic materials in many applications since the earliest appear- ance of these materials. An overview of past, present and future usage is presented. The discussion includes exam- ples of fuselage, control system, main rotor, energy attenuator and engine cowling/firewall applications. 790579. Development of an Aircraft Composite Propeller. W. B. Harlamert and R. Edinger, Hartzell Propeller, Inc. The current aircraft noise regulations effected the design of propellers where tip speeds were reduced to meet these regulations. Reduced tip speeds were accomplished by reducing propeller rpm and/or propeller diameter. To retain propeller performance, diameters were increased, or the number of blades increased, respectively. These changes effected the propeller weight drastically. A composite propeller blade has been developed that is significantly lighter than a blade fabricated from aluminum. Additional advantages of the composite blade is strength and maintenance characteristics. Considerable testing was accomplished to demonstrate the strength and fatigue characteristics of the blade. 1979 SA E Transactions 790580. Design Description of a Four-Place Business Jet Using Two WR-19 Engines. Jan Roskam, Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence, KS. This paper describes the design of an advanced, four-place business jet airplane around two Williams-Research WR-19 engines. In addition to the general layout, the performance, weight and balance characteristics of the airplane are described and illustrated by graphical examples. A detailed comparison in terms of fuel-used is made with the Leaijet M35, the Cessna Citation I, the Foxjet and several other general aviation twins. It is shown that the airplane described offers substantial advantages in terms of fuel economy over all these airplanes. 790581. The Learjet "Longhorn" Series - The First Jets with Winglets. Peter T. Reynolds, Gates Learjet Corp. On August 27, 1977, the Gates Learjet Model 28 prototype made its first flight and became the first jet to fly with winglets. Winglet theory and history, performance im- provements of the Model 28/29 and the Model 50 Series configuration are discussed in this paper. 1979 SA E Transactions 790582. Improving Business Jet Performance: The Mark Five Sabreliner. Lawrence M. Timmons, The Raisbeck Group, Seattle, WA. Following the successful Mark II Learjet modification program, the Raisbeck Group set out to improve the performance of the Sabreliner series of aircraft. By applying a unique combination of theoretical analysis, flight test development and advanced FAA certification methods, the Raisbeck Mark Five Sabreliner became a reality. This configuration, with advanced aerodynamics, systems and structure has been incorporated on both existing and new production versions of the aircraft. It offers a minimum of 25% range increase while main- taining or reducing takeoff and landing field lengths. The development approach used for the Mark Five system is detailed, including the rationale for each of the improve- ments incorporated. FAA certification plan procedures used on this program are discussed. Performance im- provements realized in actual operation of the Mark Five system are also detailed to demonstrate the advantages from a customer's viewpoint. 790583. A General Aviation Flight Test Application of the On-Board Computer. Paul R. Leckman, Rockwell International. Recent advances in mini-computers and micro-computers have made possible the development of low cost flight test data acquisition systems, suitable for general aviation aircraft. The development of a data acquisition system at a general aviation company will be discussed. Use of an on-board mini-computer to minimize the required man- hours for general aviation aircraft performance data reduction will also be discussed. Additionally, both the advantages realized and the implementation problems will be described. The present trend in computer development will probably lead to more extensive use of on-board com- puters for general aviation flight test activities in the future. 790584. Design of Quiet Efficient Propellers. George P. Succi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. A numerical computation scheme has been developed to determine the sound generated by propellers. A compar- ison of these calculations to the noise data taken in the flight test of a propeller driven aircraft shows good agreement. The method is then applied in a parametric study of fixed pitch propellers designed to reduce noise. All these techniques reduce noise while maintaining shaft speed so that the method presented here may be used in a retrofit option for the general aviation fleet. 1979 SA E Transactions 790585. Practical Design of Minimum Induced Loss Propellers. E. Eugene Larrabee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. An efficient procedure, which may be adapted to pocket calculators, has been developed to determine the geometry of minimum induced loss propellers matched to a specified operating point characterized by disc loading, advance ratio, and number of blades. Consistent pro- 93</page><page sequence="77">790587-790591 cedures are described to account for the effects of arbitrary geometry, off design point operation, and propeller-body interaction. These procedures are utilized by George Succi in a companion paper on the design of quiet propellers. 1979 SA E Transactions 790587. Crashworthiness Analysis of Field Investigation of Business Aircraft Accidents. Richard G. Snyder and Thomas J. Armstrong, Highway Safety Research Institute and The Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, The University of Michigan. Business and executive aviation represent a combined total of over 40% of the general aviation fleet, but (1977) accounted for only 8.37% of all general aviation accidents recorded. During the period 1964-1977 some 7,351 aircraft engaged in business flying, and 883 in corporate/executive operations, were involved in accidents reported by the NTSB. These accidents were reviewed utilizing The University of Michigan Computerized Accident Files to provide an overall view of the incidence and nature of business/executive aircraft accidents relative to occupant crash injuries. In addition more detailed case studies of selected accidents investigated including a Lear Jet 25B, Cessna 421, Beech Volpar Model 18, and Ted Smith Aerostar 601, are provided to illustrate specific types of crashworthiness, occupant protection, or post-crash emer- gency egress findings applicable to business/executive operations. Post-crash fire was reported in 29 cases (16.3%) during the 3-year period (1975-1977). Emergency egress problems involving smoke and fire are discussed. Data from 1975-1977 indicate that the chances of being fatally injured in an accident is significantly greater than receiving serious injury, suggesting a lack of crash worthy performance which may be predicted to improve as more accidents occur in which crew shoulder harnesses are installed and worn. 790588. Nonlinear Structural Crash Dynamics Analyses. R. J. Hayduk and R. G. Thomson, NASA Langley Research Center; G. Wittlin, Lockheed Corporation; and M. P. Kamat, Virginia Poly- technic Institute and State University. Presented in this paper are the results of three nonlinear computer programs, KRASH, ACTION and DYCAST used to analyze the dynamic response of a twin-engine, low-wing airplane section subjected to an 8.38 m/s (27.5 ft/s) vertical impact velocity crash condition. This impact condition simulates the vertical sink rate in a shallow aircraft landing or takeoff accident. The three distinct analysis techniques for nonlinear dynamic response of aircraft structures are briefly exam- ined and compared versus each other and the experi- mental data. The report contains brief descriptions of the three computer programs, the respective aircraft section mathematical models, pertinent data from the experi- mental test performed at NASA Langley, and a compar- ison of the analyses versus test results. Cost and accuracy comparisons between the three analyses are made to illustrate the possible uses of the different nonlinear programs and their future potential. 1979 SA E Transactions 790589. Experimental Verification of Program KRASH - A Mathematical Model for General Aviation Structural Crash Dynamics. G. Wittlin, Lockheed-California Co.; D. J. Ahrens and A. W. Bloedel, Cessna Aircraft Co. The results of four fully instrumented, full-scale crash tests involving a single-engine, high-wing light airplane are described herein. The tests were performed under a contract sponsored by the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration. The range of impact conditions included initial airplane roll and/or yaw, a nose-down attitude, a flared nose-up attitude and impacts onto a rigid (concrete) and a flexible (soil) surface. Photographs are presented showing the impact conditions, as well as some typical postcrash damage. The crash test models, analyzed using digital computer Program KRASH, are described. Typical analysis versus test correlation results as well as a summary correlation for all four crash tests are presented. The application of Program KRASH to assess structural design concepts with regard to crash dynamics charac- teristics is briefly described. 790590. Seat/Occupant Crash Dynamic Analysis Veri- fication Test Program. R. F. Chandler, FAA Civil Aeromedicai Inst., Oklahoma City, OK; and D. H. Laananen^Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA. The Federal Aviation Administration is developing a computer modeling program (SOMLA - Seat Occupant Model: Light Aircraft) in an attempt to provide a practical engineering and design analysis tool for aircraft seat designers. To validate the model, two series of well-instrumented controlled tests have been completed by the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute. These tests used two basic seat configurations, two different impact vector orientations, and two different impact levels to produce both elastic and plastic seat deformations. Measurements of seat reaction loads, seatbelt loads, and dummy accelerations were made, and the tests were documented by high-speed motion picture film. Each test condition was repeated to obtain a statistical measure of test variability. The results of these tests, and their impli- cations regarding the development of the model, are presented. 790591. NASA General Aviation Crashworthiness Seat Development. Edwin L. Fasanella, Vought Corp., Hampton, VA; and Emilio Alfaro-Bou, NASA-Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. 94</page><page sequence="78">790592-790599 Three load limiting seat concepts for general aviation aircraft designed to lower the deceleration of the occupant in the event of a crash were sled tested and evaluated with reference to a standard seat. Dummy pelvis accelerations were reduced up to 50 percent with one of the concepts. Computer program MSOMLA (Modified Seat Oc- cupant Model for Light Aircraft) was used to simulate the behavior of a dummy passenger in a NASA full-scale crash test of a twin engine light aircraft. A computer graphics package MANPLOT was developed to pictor- ially represent the occupant and seat motion. 1979 SA E Transactions 790592. Crash-Resistant Fuel Systems for General Avia- tion Aircraft. W. Thomas Edwards, Federal Aviation Admin., NAFEC, Atlantic City, NJ; and William M. Perrella, Jr., FAA, Northwest Region. A significant percentage of general aviation aircraft accidents result in postcrash fires due to the ignition of spilled fuel. This condition often causes further injury or even death to the occupants. Testing was undertaken to examine the performance of light-weight, flexible, crash-resistant fuel cells with frangible fuel line couplings. Included in the experiments were four full-scale crash tests of a typical light twin- engined aircraft. In three of these tests, the crash-resistant fuel system performed satisfactorily. However, the fourth test, which used the lightest weight tanks, resulted in tank failures which indicated a possible lower strength limit to the tank material. 790593. The Impact of Noise Regulations on Propeller Design. D. G. M. Davis, Dowty Rotol Ltd., Gloucester, England. Propeller noise is largely dependent upon tip speed and a reduction of this inevitably leads to either performance or weight penalty. A new aerofoil section has been developed which permits blade loading to be increased. Thus, slower revving propellers can be designed without degrading the performance or imposing a weight penalty. The paper introduces the characteristic differences in performance of the new section with more conventional ones and looks at the design of a range of propellers to illustrate the trade between noise, performance and weight with each type. 1979 SA E Transactions 790594. Propeller Aircraft Noise Around General Aviation Airports. Fred W. J. van Deventer, Dept. of Aerospace Engrg., Delft Univ. of Technology (Delft/The Netherlands). In recent years systematic flyover noise measurements of propeller driven general aviation airplanes were per- formed. This paper presents a brief description of the measurement and data reduction techniques together with some results. Computation methods are given to estimate the effect of powersetting on the noise level and to approximate the shape of the noise field around these aircraft. They are used to compute Leq-contours around general aviation airports. Contour plots are used to compare the relative effects of several measures for noise reduction on the ground. Noise reduction at the source is the most effective way to achieve this goal. 790596. Preliminary QCGAT Program Test Results. R. W. Koenig and G. K. Sievers, NASA, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. NASA Lewis Research Center is conducting a program to demonstrate that large commercial engine technology can be applied to general aviation engines to reduce noise, emissions and fuel consumption and to develop new technology where required. Following a study Phase I, two contractors (AiResearch and AVCO-Lycoming) were selected to design, fabricate, assemble, test and deliver their respective Quiet, Clean General Aviation Turbofan (QCGAT) experimental engines to NASA. The QCGAT engines have now entered the test phase. This paper describes the overall engine program, design, and tech- nology incorporated into the QCGAT engines. In addi- tion, preliminary engine test results are presented and compared to the technical requirements the engines were designed to meet. 790598. Proper Aircraft Tire Size Selection - Optimum Performance with Minimum Maintenance. Larry J. Gehrett, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. High speeds with heavy loads represent the type of operating condition to which the aircraft tire is subjected during its utilization on business aircraft. This type of operation produces severe dynamic forces that challenge the tire design engineer. This challenge is met by selecting the proper tire size, incorporating the necessary design features into the tire construction, and then thoroughly testing the tire to ensure compliance with the performance requirements established by the airframe engineer. The result of selecting the proper tire size is optimum tire and aircraft performance achieved with minimum cost for both airframe manufacturer and end user - the aircraft customer. 790599. Advanced Braking Controls for Business Aircraft. D. M. Longyear and E. A. Hirzel, Hydro-Aire Div., Crane Co. This paper discusses the phenomenon involved in stop- ping an aircraft and the capabilities required to meet Microwave Landing System operations. Today's major terminals are becoming saturated, primarily because of the increased commercial traffic, and to relieve the pressure, business aircraft are being relegated to outlying fields. In some airports, they are severely restricted or outlawed. The Microwave Landing System opens new vistas for the entire aviation industry because it greatly expands the access to the terminal and thereby offers additional 95</page><page sequence="79">790600-790607 landing windows for the business aircraft operators. However, to operate in the Microwave Landing System, the nonscheduled operator will be required to have avionics equipment similar to the larger commercial aircraft. Also, if he is to take full advantage of the landing facilities, he will require full automatic braking capability. 790600. AIRCON® Electrically Heated Acrylic. Wolfram Rothe, PPG Industries, Inc. For years the only method available for application of electric heat to plastic aircraft transparencies has been with the usage of gold film technology. PPG has developed a new method for accomplishing this objective by utilizing the resistance wire technology used success- fully for years by PPG in glass laminates. This paper presents the AIRCON® heating system designed for acrylic transparencies. The AIRCON in Plastic heating system is now in production for low voltage aircraft systems, but is also applicable for the higher voltages found on commercial and military aircraft. Specific items discussed are the advantages, performance, and durability of the heating system, and application to the variety of aircraft. A solution to the problem of transparency failure due to static electricity discharge is also presented. 790601. Application of Split-Film Anemometer and Mini- Computer for Measurement in Turbulent Sepa- rated Flow. W. H. Wentz, Wichita State Uni- versity; D. C. Howe, Gates Learjet Corp., K. A. Fiscko, U.S. Army; and T. Habluetzel, Wichita State University. A split-film anemometer has been adapted for meas- urement of highly turbulent intermittently reversing flows in regions of local separation around airfoils and flaps. Analog signals from the split-film anemometer are fed directly to a mini-computer for processing and analysis. Mean velocity magnitude and direction, intermittency of reversal, turbulence intensity and histograms of the velocity are obtained as outputs of the system. 790602. Canadair Challenger Flight Test Status. Ronald D. Neal, Canadair Ltd. The Canadair Challenger is an all new business jet aircraft. This paper provides an overview of the current development status (March 1979) on this airplane with specific emphasis on the flight test program. 790603. A New Light Twin Using Bonded Metal Con- struction. Bruce McCullough and Lloyd W. Bingham, Jr., Gulfstream American Corp. This paper describes the design and certification program for a new light twin-engine aircraft. The factors consid- ered in the design of the aircraft, the flight testing, and the changes required for certification are described. Some of the problems encountered in flight testing, and the solutions to these problems, are also discussed. 790604. Some Theoretical Considerations of a Stall Proof Airplane. H. L. Chevalier, Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station, TX. For the stall proof airplane there should be a stabilizing pitching moment below the stall angle of attack of sufficient amount to prevent the attainment of the stall angle of attack which cannot be over-ridden by control deflections. This paper presents 1) a development of the moment equations to show the theoretical considerations of a stall proof airplane; 2) the nonlinear moment characteristics that must be obtained to satisfy the stall proof requirements. In addition, it is shown that an aerodynamic spoiler located on the under surface of the horizontal tail can be designed to meet these requirements of a stall proof airplane. Wind tunnel results are shown to validate assumptions and predictions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790605. Concepts for Reducing Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Consumption of the Aircraft Piston Engine. Bernard J. Rezy, Kenneth J. Stučkas, J. Ronald Tucker and Jay E. Meyers, Teledyne Conti- nental Motors, Mobile, AL. Exhaust emissions standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for aircraft piston engines, rising fuel prices and the possibility of reduced fuel availability generated the need for research aimed at reducing exhaust emissions while at the same time improving the fuel economy of General Aviation aircraft piston engines. Projected benefits from exploratory testing and ana- lytical predictions have resulted in this effort to investigate and develop three concepts which, when applied to an aircraft piston engine, provide reductions in exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide while simultaneously improving fuel economy. The three chosen concepts, an improved fuel injection system, an improved cooling cylinder head, and exhaust air inejction, when combined, have the potential to show a synergistic relationship in achieving these goals. 1979 SA E Transactions 790606. Dual Breakerless Aircraft Magneto. R. S. Cerny and J. J. Wycallis, Engine Products Div., The Bendix Corp., Sidney, NY. Conventional magnetos require a periodic maintenance schedule in order to ensure optimum magneto perform- ance. Cam, follower and pivot wear together with breaker contact erosion can shift ignition timing and degrade magneto performance. The dual breakerless aircraft magneto development was undertaken to eliminate these problem areas and result in a virtually maintenance free aircraft magneto. 790607. Effects of Air Injection on a Turbocharged Teledyne Continental Motors TSIO-360-C En- gine. Donald V. Cosgrove and Erwin E. 96</page><page sequence="80">790608-790613 Kempke, National Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. A fuel-injected, turbocharged, six-cylinder air cooled Teledyne Continental Motors TSIO-360-C aircraft engine was operated over a range of test conditions to investigate factors influencing the effectiveness of air injection in reducing exhaust emissions. The test program included the standard EPA five-mode baseline cycle revised to a seven-mode cycle and engine fuel-air ratio leanout tests. All tests were carried out using induction and cooling air at a temperature of 59° F and a relative humidity of 60%. Such factors as composition and temperature of the reacted mixtures were evaluated by varying the engine fuel-air ratio and exhaust tube air injection flow rates for various engine loads. No attempt was made to optimize the location of the point of air injection. The standard exhaust system was not modified other than to weld air injection couplings below the cylinder heads in the exhaust tubes. Air was injected into the exhaust tube of each cylinder for all modes and an exhaust gas analysis was made for hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide content. For the revised seven-mode EPA baseline cycle it was found that as the amount of injection air was increased both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons showed a marked decrease while the oxides of nitrogen changed only slightly. When sufficient air was injected to lower the pollutant levels to meet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards it was found that the temperature of the exhaust gas mixture as it entered the turbine exceeded the maximum recommended temperature of 1650° F by approximately 225° F while operating in the high power modes. Leanout data on a mode basis showed that, in the lower power modes of idle and taxi, air injection was more effective in reducing hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide at the richer fuel-air ratios. At the higher power modes of takeoff, climb, and approach air injection was more effective at the leaner fuel-air ratios. In combining air injection at various rates of flow and leaning the engine mixture through fuel management it was found that the EPA standard could be met while not exceeding a turbine inlet temperature of 1650°F. 1979 SA E Transactions 790608. Selection of Aircraft Turbocharger Systems. Neil Richardson, AiResearch Industrial Div., The Garrett Corp. Selection of turbochargers and control systems for aircraft engines is aided by analytical predictions of system performance and by comparisons of flight test data to the prediction model. This paper reviews the selection criteria and the performance prediction process. A comparison of control systems and an example of flight test data analysis are included. 790669. Determination of Cooling Air Mass Flow for a Horizontally-Opposed Aircraft Engine Installa- tion. S. J. Miley, E. J. Cross, Jr., N. A. Ghomi and P. D. Bridges, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Mississippi State University. The relationship between the amount of cooling air flow and the corresponding flow pressure difference across an aircraft engine was investigated in flight and on the ground. The flight test results were consistent with theory, but indicated a significant installation leakage problem. A ground test blower system was used to identify and reduce the leakage. The correlation between ground test cell determined engine orifice characteristics and flight meas- urements showed good agreement if the engine pressure difference was based on total pressure rather than static pressure. 1979 SA E Transactions 790612. Fretting Fatigue, with Reference to Aircraft Structures. J. A. Alic, Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, DC (On leave from Wichita State Univ.); and A. Kantimathi, Wichita State Univ., Wichita, KS. Fretting - small amplitude back-and-forth slip of mating parts - accelerates the initiation and early stages of growth of fatigue cracks. This is a common problem in aircraft structural joints, where fretting may lead to fatigue cracking at faying surfaces and also within fastener holes. Present knowledge concerning the mechanisms of fretting fatigue is reviewed, with particular attention to the following factors: stresses at and near the contacting surfaces; location of crack initiation sites with respect to regions of highest surface stress and the slip-nonslip boundary; contributions of surface damage to crack initiation; propagation of microcracks initiated by fret- ting; the effects of mean stress; and fretting fatigue under variable amplitude loading. In the experimental program, a specially constructed apparatus was used to simulate conditions at the faying surface in a structural joint. Fretting fatigue tests were carried out on 7075-T7351 aluminum alloy using stress ratios of +0.2, +0.5, and -0.2. The results are compared to baseline tests on the same alloy without fretting and are discussed in terms of the effect of stress ratio. Because of the rapid crack initiation under fretting conditions, a crack propagation approach to fretting fatigue design and analysis is suggested. 790613. New Technologies for General Aviation Aircraft. Karl H. Bergey, School of Aerospace, Mechan- ical, and Nuclear Engrg., Univ. of Oklahoma. This paper reports on an assessment of new technologies for use in general aviation aircraft. It describes an assessment procedure that provides a consistent basis for comparing the relative merits of different technologies. The study concludes that at least 46 new or under-used technologies could be incorporated in general aviation aircraft with benefit to safety, performance, utility, and cost. 97</page><page sequence="81">790614-790620 The rate at which these new technologies can be integrated into the fleet will depend on social and political trends as well as on the technologies themselves. The report identifies 22 trends that will influence general aviation development. Four examples of aircraft designs that could capitalize on these new technical opportunities are included in the report. 790614. General Aviation Aircraft Design for Perform- ance Using Small Computers. J. C. Narramore, Cessna Aircraft Co. A computerized preliminary design system for recipro- cating engine aircraft has been developed which is applicable to a desk top mini-computer. This system integrates several performance, aerodynamics, and struc- tural weight estimation routines into a procedure capable of investigating a wide variety of aircraft design problems. After the conceptual configuration and performance requirements are established, the mini-computer design system can be used to determine the aircraft and engine size which will satisfy the requirements and be the least expensive to build or operate. Carpet plots can be used to overlay data showing performance relative to a baseline configuration for a hypothetical design case. 790616. Recent Results Obtained with a New Method for Measuring Aircraft Power and Drag in Flight. Frederick O. Smetana, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carlina State Univ., Raleigh, NC; and Stan R. Fox, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC. Progress is reported in the development of a method to extract thrust horsepower and drag simultaneously from accelerated flight maneuvers. Although the flight data still is not as self-compatible as desired, the extracted drag and power obtained from a pullup-pushover agree reasonably well with the results from steady flight determinations for drag and wind tunnel tests for power. In the level flight acceleration only the extracted C^ value agrees closely. Further work is necessary to define the proper power model and to make the level flight acceleration data more self-compatible. 790617. Development of the Beechcraft Model 77. J. I. Elliott and M. L. Holcomb, Beech Aircraft Corp. The Model 77 Skipper is the result of an intensive development program to develop an economical and efficient two-place general aviation trainer. The program was initiated as a flying test bed program which allowed great freedom for Engineering evaluation of various aerodynamic, structural and mechanical concepts. This included the evaluation of different types of tail surfaces, high lift and lateral control devices, engines, propellers, etc. Along with the test bed, other tests were run with radio-controlled free flight and spin tunnel models. The test bed program was followed by the production engineering, testing and certification of the chosen production configuration. 790618. Full-Scale Wind-Tunnel Investigation of an Ayres S2R-800 Thrush Agricultural Airplane. Joseph L. Johnson, Jr., H. Clyde McLemore, Richard White and Frank L. Jordan, Jr., NASA-Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. This paper summarizes the significant results of recent full-scale wind tunnel tests at the NASA-Langley Re- search Center of the Ayres S2R-800 Thrush Agricultural Aircraft. The purpose of the tests was to provide fundamental aerodynamic, performance, and stability and control information of the airplane and dispersal equip- ment; and to study near-field wake interaction charac- teristics behind the aircraft. The aerodynamic tests included the use of a propeller thrust-torque balance to measure the efficiency of the propeller in the presence of the engine and to provide data for determining slipstream interference effects and slip-stream drag. 790619. New Opportunities for Future Small Civil Tur- bine Engines - Overviewing the GATE Studies. William C. Strack, NASA, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. This paper presents an overview of four independent studies that explore the opportunities for future General Aviation Turbine Engines (GATE) in the 150-1000 SHP class. Detroit Diesel Allison, Garrett/ AiResearch, Tele- dyne CAE, and Williams Research participated along with several airframers. These studies forecasted the potential impact of advanced technology turbine engines in the post- 1988 market, identified important aircraft and missions, desirable engine sizes, engine performance and cost goals. Parametric evaluations of various engine cycles, configurations, design features, and advanced technology elements defined baseline conceptual engines for each of the important missions identified by the market analysis. Both fixed- wing and helicopter aircraft, and turboshaft, turboprop, and turbofan engines were considered. All four companies predicted sizable per- formance gains (e.g., 20% SFC decrease), and three predicted large engine cost reductions of sufficient magnitude to challenge the reciprocating engine in the 300-500 SHP class. Key technology areas were recom- mended for NASA support in order to realize these improvements. 790620. Rolls-Royce RB.401-07 Turbofan Engine for Business Aircraft in the 1980's. M. A. Wilson and R. J. Cant, Rolls-Royce Limited. It has become increasingly clear that a new engine in the 5000 lb (22.44 kN) to 6000 lb (26.69 kN) thrust class is required for the 1980's to power the developing and prospective medium sized business jets. Greater range with higher rates of climb and cruising speeds will all 98</page><page sequence="82">790621-790627 become achievable by applying existing current big engine technology to the small engine in a simpler form. The paper describes an engine designed to meet these future needs. The choice of cycle is discussed, the mechanical design described and a résumé is given of the development programme in which four engines have now been used. 790621. A Review of Curtiss-Wright Rotary Engine Developments with Respect to General Aviation Potential. Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp. Relevant Rotary Engine developments at Curtiss-Wright over the period 1958-1979 are reviewed. Applicable automotive engine developments, including Stratified Charge, flight test results and future projections are presented. The current 300 HP aircraft engine prototype development status is discussed relative to application of parallel direct injected unthrottled Stratified Charge technology gains which demonstrated automotive diesel engine fuel consumption levels, low emissions and multi-fuel operation in other Rotary engine models. 790622. Electromechanical Actuation for Business Air- craft. Daniel K. Bird, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. The actual development and test of electromechanical actuation hardware for critical, manned aircraft, flight control application that is specifically designed to inter- face with fly-by-wire commands is now represented by only two hardware units. One of these units was built by Delco Electronics for NASA-Houston and the second unit built by AiResearch Manufacturing Company for the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. Each of these units feature inside-out motor designs using rare earth samarium cobalt permanent magnet rotors with electronic commutation and are powered with 270 volt DC electrical power. The innovative design features, incorporated in these two actuation units, are thought to have a signif- icance for the future that will eventually influence actuation design for business aircraft. 790623. A Comparison of Hydraulic, Pneumatic, and Electro-Mechanical Actuators for General Avia- tion Flight Controls. J. Roskam, M. Rice and H. Eysink, Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence, KS. The paper compares the size, weight and performance characteristics of hydraulic, pneumatic and electro- mechanical actuators for general aviation flight controls. Mathematical models for each type are presented. Actu- ator designs for specific control tasks in realistic light airplane applications are compared with each other. It is shown that electro-mechanical actuators utilizing the recently developed samarium-cobalt technology have significant advantages in terms of size and weight requirements while yielding very fast response. 790624. A Canister Fuel Pump for General Aviation Aircraft. R. R. Goelz and R. W. Rothfusz, Airborne Mfg. Co. A new family of canister-type fuel pumps for use on both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft in general aviation use will be described. The pump, which features a wet-brush DC motor, offers advantages on aircraft where ease of maintenance and minimum downtime is very important. Major features of the new design, pump performance, and maintenance cost savings will be discussed. 790625. An Experimental Study of Propeller-Induced Structural Vibration and Interior Noise. James T. Howlett and James A. Schoenster, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. This paper presents results of tests conducted to study fuselage sidewall dynamics and their effects on the cabin interior noise of a twin-engine, propeller-driven, light aircraft. Data on the dynamic behavior were obtained by slowly sweeping the RPM of one of the engines while the aircraft was stationary on the ground. This technique allowed frequency response plots of the sidewall structural accelerations to be obtained. These accelerations are compared to similar results from a test using a mechanical shaker in order to evaluate the structural dynamic response caused by the harmonics of the propeller blade passage tone. The dynamic response of the fuselage sidewall is also discussed as a noise transmission mech- anism. A second mechanism for noise transmission through the fuselage sidewall was investigated by opening the copilot's window. The results illustrate the complex nature of the noise transmission mechanisms and the importance of correctly assessing noise paths. 790626. Engine Induced Structural-Borne Noise in a General Aviation Aircraft. James F. Unruh and Dennis C. Scheidt, Southwest Research Inst., San Antonio, TX. This paper describes a study of engine induced structural- borne noise in a single engine light aircraft. Cabin noise and fuselage vibration levels were recorded during ground tests for engine-attached, engine-detached, interior- installed, and interior-removed configurations. By com- parisons of the data, engine induced structure-borne noise is shown to be a primary source of cabin noise. Corresponding fuselage vibration levels were quite high with energy concentrated mainly in the lower frequencies. A measure of the noise control effectiveness of the interior trim was also obtained. 1979 SA E Transactions 790627. Summary of Noise Reduction Characteristics of Typical General Aviation Materials. J. Roskam, F. Grosveld and J. van Aken, Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence, KS. The paper presents the results of a large number of systematic tests to determine noise reduction character- istics of general aviation materials. Effects of material 99</page><page sequence="83">790629-790642 type (metallic and composite), thickness, panel stiffening, vibration damping materials, sound absorption materials and pressurization on noise reduction are included. Several promising methods for reducing cabin interior noise in light airplanes are discussed based on the results. 1979 SA E Transactions 790629. Effects of Extended Oil Changes on Aircraft Piston Engine Wear and Oil Characteristics. Weldon E. Garrelts, Univ. of Illinois, Institute of Aviation, Savoy, IL. Two aircraft reciprocating piston engines were run to their recommended 200 hour overhaul periods utilizing 200 hour oil changes and 100 hour filter changes. The oil was tested each 200 hours for contamination, additive deple- tion, and wear-metal concentrations. Upon completion of the study, both engines were disassembled and compared with two engines that were operated 600 hours beyond their recommended 2000 hour overhauls using normal oil and filter change periods. Results indicated that oil could be used safely for 200 hours under closely monitored conditions for a particular aircraft fleet operation. 790630. Detonation Characteristics of Soviet GOST 1012-72 Aviation Gasoline. John W. Sibole, Jr., AVCO Lycoming Williamsport Div., AVCO Corp., Williamsport, PA. Chemical analyses, CFR engine knock tests, and a full scale turbocharged aircraft engine detonation test were conducted to compare the detonation characteristics of Soviet Grade GOST 1012-72 fuel and a commercially available Grade 100 Low Lead Aviation Gasoline. Chemical analysis indicated significant differences in the composition of the two fuels, particularly with respect to aromatic and tetraethyl lead contents. CFR engine knock test data indicated that the GOST 1012-72 fuel clearly was lower in knock value than the 100 Low Lead fuel, and full scale engine detonation testing supported these results. Modified detonation-imposed operating limitations were developed for the full scale aircraft engine model tested. No conclusions have been made with respect to long-term effects of GOST 1012-72 fuel usage on engine condition and performance. 790631. Designing with Damping Materials to Reduce Noise and Structural Fatigue. Edmund O'Keefe, Specialty Composites Corp., Newark, DE. Increasing the amount of structural damping in aircraft components has several design advantages in the control of noise and vibration problems. Principal of these advantages are weight and design cost savings. However, proper design requires a knowledge of the structure environment and would include factors such as the operating temperature and vibration frequency. The engineer must also have a complete characterization of the damping materials viscoelastic properties. The damping material is most conveniently presented using the reduced temperature format which shows the loss factor and stiffness as a continuous function of both temperature and frequency. When the structural environment and damping properties are known, an accurate determination of composite panel behavior can be determined using standard beam equations. This paper describes some of the steps necessary in damping design for constrained layer dampers. Also presented are a few case histories where damping has been successfully used to minimize resonant noise and vibration problems. 790640. Selected Aspects of Gas Générants Research. J. T. Herridge, Battelle, Columbus Labs. Battelle's Columbus Laboratories recently completed an objective review of gas générants research for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. This paper describes highlights of that program and summarizes its key results. Included are assessments of what is known about the safety, health, and environmental effects of the subject gas générants and a narrative presentation of the salient results for a selected set of critical exploratory experi- ments conducted by Battelle. Scope of the subject program covered the complete life cycle of the gas générant materials and their associated passive restraint systems - i.e., the manufacturing phase, the consumer use phase, and the disposal/recyling phase. Apparent open issues are identified and considerations for future action are presented. 790641. An Investigation of the Potential Human and Environmental Impacts Associated with Motor Vehicle Air Bag Restraint Systems. Lawrence J. Partridge, Jr. and G. Stewart Young, Arthur D. Little, Inc. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers are required under the provisions of Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 to provide passive restraint systems in their large 1982 model year passenger vehicles. Air bag restraint systems based upon either a hybrid or pyrotechnic design can provide the necessary restraining provisions required by MVSS 208. However, there are many questions which remain to be answered regarding the potential risks which these air bag systems may pose. The air bag life cycle, including intended use, abandonment, scrapyards, junkyards, and metal melting operations, is evaluated to assess the various risks which air bag systems pose to humans, the biological environment, and the flora and fauna inhabiting these areas. These risks are estimated through the application of traditional risk analysis techniques, including failure mode and effect analysis and fault-tree analysis. 790642. Sodium Azide - The Federal Responsibility. Bruce C. Buckheit and William R. Fan, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. The authors discuss present and future Federal involve- ment in decisions relating to the use of sodium azide to generate gas for air bags and stress the need to establish a 100</page><page sequence="84">790643-790647 perspective from which to examine the raw data con- cerning the associated health hazards. Several examples are given of other chemicals which present problems in the manufacture, use, and disposal of automobiles. The authors suggest that these hazards be minimized through generic proceedings. 790643. The MVMA Gas Générants Investigation. Serge Gratch, Ford Motor Co.; and Carl C. McConnell, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assoc. The events leading to the undertaking by the MVMA of a study on the potential impacts of gas générants on humans and on the environment are briefly reviewed and the overall findings of the two contractors retained to carry out the investigation are summarized. It is con- cluded that "there are no identifiable events in the air bag restraint system life cycle which could be classified as imminently dangerous to either human or environmental species." There may be concerns associated with the disposal of vehicles equipped with air bags, but these concerns appear resolvable. The number of air bag- equipped vehicles reaching the disposal phase is expected to grow rather slowly, so that several years should be available for such resolution. 790644. Application of Rankine Bottoming Diesel Engines to Marine Vessels. Richard A. Tarkir, Advanced Technology, Inc. The use of organic Rankine cycle energy recovery systems can be an effective means of reducing fuel consumption for some types of diesel-powered marine vessels. An organic Rankine cycle diesel bottoming system is capable of recovering the equivalent of from a few percent to more than 20 percent of the base diesel engine output power from the exhaust gas energy. As a more desirable alternative to producing additional shaft horsepower, fuel consumption of the base diesel engine could be reduced by a comparative amount. Analysis indicates that Rankine cycle recovery systems could be cost-effective for diesel marine vessels that operate at high-duty cycle load factors. 790645. Ceramics in Heat Engines. R. Kamo, Cummins Engine Co.; and W. Bryzik, Propulsion Systems Div., U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Research and Development Command (TARADCOM). Recent developments of high performance ceramics have given a new impetus for the advancement of heat engines. The thermal efficiencies of the Otto, Diesel, Brayton and the Stirling cycle can now be improved by higher operating temperatures, reduced heat loss, and exhaust energy recovery. Although physical and chemical prop- erties of the high performance ceramics have been improved significantly, they still fall short of meeting the requirements necessary for application and commercial- ization of advanced heat engine concepts. Aside from the need for greater strength, the problems of consistency, quality, design, material inspection, insulative properties, oxidation and other important features must be solved before high performance ceramics can be considered a viable material for advanced heat engines. Several approaches in developing an adiabatic engine design in the laboratory are shown. Other possible future im- provements such as the minimum friction unlubricated engine through the use of ceramics are also described. 790646. Installation of a Diesel-Organic Rankine Com- pound Engine in a Class 8 Truck for a Single- Vehicle Test. Edward Doyle and Luco DiNanno, Thermo Electron; and Saunders Kramer, Dept. of Energy. A Class 8 truck has been equipped with a diesel-organic Rankine compound engine in preparation for a 1-year test program. The compound engine consists of an organic Rankine bottoming cycle system directly coupled to a Mack diesel engine from which it recovers the waste heat in the exhaust gases. The components of the bottoming cycle system are described, and their installations in three pre-assembled modules - a power conversion package, a vapor generator, and a cooling system - are discussed. Plans for the 1-year test program, including baseline performance tests on the compound engine, chassis dynamometer tests, noise tests, and over-the-road fuel economy measurements, are also outlined. 790647. Fouling Effects of Turbine Exhaust Gases on Heat Exchanger Tubes for Heat Recovery Sys- tems. Robert D. Rogalski, David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center. This paper discusses test results of inserting a cylindrical fouling probe unit in a shipboard LM2500 and a land-based Solar Saturn gas turbine exhausts. These probes are total heat flux measurement devices for film chemistry and heat transfer experiments under simulated heat exchanger conditions. The average film build-up rate and heat transfer rate are inversely proportional to the test time. The total thermal resistance of the fouled probe increased linearly with time. After a five-hour test, the measured fouling thermal resistance factor was 1.5 times the recommended TEMA design factor. As the average surface temperature for the tests increased, the average fouling film build-up rate and the film sulfur content decreased. Lower wall temperatures produce thicker fouling films. The thermal conductivity of the test films ranged from 0.0204 to 0.0272 BTU/HR-F-ft2/ft (0.0353 to 0.0470 J/sec-K-m2/m). Up to 30% by weight of the film samples consists of metals and sulfur present in the fuel as impurities or additives. Fouling deposits from shipboard waste heat boiler operations, unlike those from land-based operation, will be affected by more alkali metals in salty air. 1979 SA E Transactions 101</page><page sequence="85">790648-790655 790648. Computer Simulation of a Proposed Marine COGAS Propulsion System. Jerry W. Watts, Weapons and Systems Engrg. Dept., U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD. The equilibrium conditions at various power levels of a conceptual COGAS (combined gas turbine and steam turbine) system have been modeled on a digital computer. The steam turbine contributes a higher fraction of total power at part power loads than it does at full power loads. In the Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU) boiling moves away from the economizer as the power level is raised. 790649. Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) Program as a Viable Cost-Effective Emissions Reduction Op- tion. J. A. Gunderson, E. J. Vodonick, G. Pan and D. Clark, Systems Control, Inc. This paper summarizes the actions and results pursuant to the development of a motor vehicle inspection/main- tenance program. The general methodology used in collecting data, determining criteria, screening program options, and evaluating alternative configurations are presented. General results for various criteria such as: emissions reduction, repair costs, fuel savings, and capital/operating costs are included based on the study findings from a number of states. The basic state administrative option was used as a basis for presenting the data. 1979 SA E Transactions 790652. Statistical Analysis of Spark Ignition Engine Quality. William E. Hatch, Automated Sciences Group, Inc.; and William M. Basham, Tech- nology Assessment Div., NHTSA, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. A methodology was developed for estimating the relative fuel efficiency of spark ignition engines from EPA vehicle certification data. The methodology is illustrated for 1978 and 1979 four cylinder engines. An empirical model was developed expressing variations in vehicle weight specific fuel consumption resulting from variations in the vehicle parameters. Regression analysis was used to estimate the model coefficients. The coefficients were then utilized to achieve a statistical normalization of vehicle weight specific fuel consumption to minimize differences among vehicles. Finally engine quality indicators were derived for ranking automobile manufacturers and for ranking indi- vidual engine types. 790653. Increased Vehicle Energy Dissipation Due to Changes in Road Roughness with Emphasis on Rolling Losses. Steven A. Velinsky and Robert A. White, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL. Tire rolling resistance, in isolation from vehicle rolling losses including dissipation in the suspension and effects of the road surface, is a weakness in present procedures as they relate to fuel economy and pollution level testing. Work by Funfsinn and Korst, based on coastdown experiments and computer simulation, has shown that substantial and measurable increases in rolling losses occur for rough road surfaces. The present investigation used vehicle axle accelerations to experimentally examine various road surfaces. Correlation with computer simu- lations allowed the development of a deterministic road roughness model which is used to predict energy dissi- pation in both the tire and suspension as functions of roughness, tire pressure, and speed. Application of the methodology to coastdown techniques and comparison to the experimental results of Funfsinn results in good agreement and confirms rolling loss increases of up to 20 percent compared to ideal smooth roads. The aerody- namic drag coefficient is also found to increase when driving on rough roads. 790654. Derivation and Discussion of a Regression Model for Estimating the Fuel Economy of Automobiles. José L. Bascunana, Technology Assessment Div., National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. This paper presents a discussion on the functional form (based on a theoretical analysis) of a regression model for estimating the fuel economy of motor vehicles. The statistical analysis tests the data for heteroskedasticity, investigates the use of different combinations of explan- atory variables, discusses multi-collinearity, and deter- mines the elasticities of fuel economy with respect to the various explanatory variables. Also, the analysis shows that the regression model can be treated as a case of restricted coefficients. The results of the statistical analysis - mainly the high value of the corrected coefficient of determination, and the very high values of the test statistics of all the coefficients of the regression - indicate that the selected model is satisfactory for the population represented by the given data. 790655. Potential for Improving Short-Trip Fuel Economy by Fuel Formulation. W. F. Marshall, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville, OK. An experimental investigation was undertaken to deter- mine the influence of fuel characteristics on fuel economy penalty incurred in short trips and in operating vehicles at other than normal ambient temperatures. The overall objective of the project was to determine the potential benefits of fuel reformulation to minimize fuel economy penalty associated with cold-start, warm-up operation. Two vehicles, fueled with gasoline and natural gas, were operated from cold start in a chassis dynamometer facility maintained at 20° and 90° F ambient tempera- tures. Results indicate 15% less energy consumed in a 5-mile trip achieved by changes in choke schedule and mixture stoichiometry which were made possible by use of the gaseous fuel. A data treatment system was devised to allow 102</page><page sequence="86">790656-790661 differentiation of economy penalty due to "friction" from that due to enrichment/choking. The friction penalty, when expressed in terms of distance, appears to be nearly independent of vehicle or engine size and is about three times greater at 20°F than at 90°F. 790656. The Influence of Urban Trip Characteristics on Vehicle Warm-Up - Implication for Urban Au- tomobile Fuel Consumption. Alan J. Horowitz and Roger L. Tobin, Transportation and Traffic Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. This analysis estimates the ratio of the fuel consumption of vehicles as driven in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. to what the fuel consumption of these vehicles would be if their fuel consumption rates during warm-up were those of fully warmed vehicles. Data on how, where and when automobiles are driven in the U.S. are combined with data relating trip length and ambient temperature to fuel consumption rate. Factors considered include trip length variations, geographical and hourly temperature variations and the different characteristics of work and nonwork trips. Averaged over weekday trips in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, fuel consumption is between 13% and 17% higher than it would be if fuel consumption rates during warm-up were those of fully warmed vehicles. 790657. Automotive Fuel Permeation Resistance - A Comparison of Elastomeric Materials. J. D. MacLachlan, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Elastomer Chemicals Dept., Akron Lab., Stow, OH. Data is presented that compares the permeation resistance of current elastomeric fuel hose construction materials to those based on fluorocarbon elastomers and fluorocarbon elastomer/hydrocarbon elastomer blends. The permeation resistance of a fluorocarbon elastomer hose compound is superior to all current hydrocarbon elastomer materials tested. Permeation rates, in some cases, are more than one hundred times better than present materials. In addition, fluorocarbon elastomers have excellent resistance to degradation from heat, ozone and the high aromatic content in current fuels. No other class of elastomers possesses this unique balance of properties. 1979 SA E Transactions 790658. Migration of Antiozonant from Neoprene Hose Covers. Michael G. Wyzgoski, Polymers Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Certain fuel line hoses having neoprene covers and nitrile inner tubes and test slabs of these materials were subjected to accelerated heat, fuel, and ozone exposure. Results indicate some neoprene hose covers can lose ozone resistance after severe test exposure to heat and/or fuel circulation. Chemical analysis indicates that one type of antiozonant, nickeldibutyldithiocarbamate, is extracted out of the neoprene cover by fuel circulation through the inner nitrile tube. Similarly, heat aging causes a migration of this antiozonant from the neoprene cover into the nitrile tube. These two factors are largely responsible for the loss of ozone resistance. Extraction of plasticizing oil also occurs during fuel circulation with subsequent hardening of hoses. However, this contributes only in a secondary manner to the observed loss of ozone resis- tance. Test conditions for candidate fuel line hoses are recommended to provide improved ozone resistance. Both Hypalon (chlorosulfonated polyethylene) and EPDM (ethylene-propylenediene monomer) hose covers show no evidence of cracking in ozone after heat aging and fuel circulation. One of these improved hose covers has been incorporated into all production vehicles for some time now. 790659. Effect of "Sour" Gasoline on Fuel Hose Rubber Materials. A. Nersasian, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Wilmington, DE. Isolated fuel hose failures have been reported recently for cars equipped with electronic fuel injection systems. Although all of the factors responsible for failure are not known, "sour" or hydroperoxide-containing gasoline was suspected as being the main contributor. A study was undertaken, therefore, to determine the effect of "sour" gasoline on the tensile properties of fuel hose rubbers. Fluorohydrocarbon rubbers exhibited outstanding resistance to attack and the lowest volume swell. Epi- chlorohydrin copolymer reverted as evidenced by extreme softening and various nitrile rubbers underwent additional vulcanization resulting in embrittlement. Practical fluorohydrocarbon hoses have been con- structed for the fuel injection system which resist deg- radation by "sour" gasoline. 1979 SA E Transactions 790660. Improved Sour Gasoline Resistance of Epichloro- hydrin Elastomer Fuel Hose. Melinda L. Zwickert, Research Center, Hercules Inc., Wilmington, DE. Laboratory studies suggest that isolated failures of epichlorohydrin copolymer (ECO) fuel hoses on cars equipped with electronic fuel injection systems were caused by exposure to "sour" (oxidized) gasoline. Results of an intensive program indicate that epi- chlorohydrin homopolymer (CO) elastomer is significant- ly more resistant to the effects of sour gasoline than ECO. The incorporation of a suitable stabilizer further enhances the sour gasoline resistance of CO elastomer and permits successful completion of both six-week static and circu- lation test procedures. 790661. Optimizing Permeation Resistance and Low Temperature Flexibility in Heat Resistant NBR Fuel Hose. James W. Horvath, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. 103</page><page sequence="87">790662-790668 The Automotive Industry has expressed concern that fuel hose performance must be improved to withstand highly aromatic fuels, sour gasoline exposure, fuel permeation loss, and more rigorous service conditions. Closer co- operation with polymer producers is required in opti- mizing performance. This report concerning the resistance of polymers to various fuels, including alcohol modification, is the result of a study to optimize properties of nitrile rubbers. It indicates that a 39% acrylonitrile CHEMIGUM HR-365 bound antioxidant nitrile rubber tube should achieve a balance of long term heat aging, fuel permeation resis- tance, and -25°C to -30°C flexibility. Coupled with a CO or CSM jacket, this type of hose should be far more economical than CFM fluoroelastomer and still resist vibration effects as low as -40° C. 1979 SA E Transactions 790662. Silicone Rubber Oil Hose Development. Rand Winters, Flex-Fab, Inc.; and Richard L. Przybyła, Dow Corning Corp. Silicone rubber oil hose has been developed for use in automobile and truck engines. Fabrication of this hose is an outgrowth of coolant hose technology. Four silicone rubber formulations for oil hose fabrication are described, each of which have the required hot oil resistance. Each offers various optional secondary properties. The results from laboratory tests indicate a greatly extended service life for all of these formulations, as compared to the life of organic rubber formulations. 790663. A New Test Method for Measuring the Combined Effects of High Temperature Immersion and Mechanical Action on Elastomeric Hose. H. H. Klever, Elastomer Chemicals Dept., Akron Lab., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Stow, OH. Conventional laboratory screening tests have not provided a completely reliable basis upon which to predict the service life of high performance automotive hose. The limitation of most test procedures is that they fail to simulate combinations of environmental conditions likely to be encountered in service. A high temperature immersion/flexure machine has been developed that eliminates the limitation of past test procedures. It is capable of rapid and accurate evaluation of tube candidates. This new procedure offers the potential for the examination of properties of a wide variety of elastomeric compositions before resorting to costly and time-consuming fabrication of hose required for impulse and field testing. The results to date have shown excellent agreement with data obtained from long-term hose impulse. 1979 ŚAE Transactions 790664. Improved NBR Vulcanizates for Use in Fuel Lines. J. R. Dunn and J. J. Ridland, Polysar Ltd. (Sarnia, Ontario, Canada). The aging and "sour" gasoline resistance of fuel line hose tube can be improved by appropriate choice of compound to meet the requirements of recently upgraded specifi- cations. The use of an NBR designed for heat resistant compounding, together with silica filler and selected plasticizer and antioxidant and a low sulphur sulphur- donor cure all contribute to improved performance. It is preferable to use cadmium oxide as activator but prom- ising zinc oxide activated compounds have also been identified. It is desirable for both aging and "sour" gasoline resistance to use an NBR with acrylonitrile content as close to 40% as low temperature requirements permit. 790666. Fiat Strada - Small Car for a Big Country. Marco Premoli, Fiat Auto S.p.A. A new small automobile, the Fiat Strada, was designed and tested to suit the special needs of the American driver. Outlined by the author are those needs, as they have shaped the American car and as they are perceived by his company. Characteristics of small cars offered on the American market in recent decades by his firm are described and analyzed. Also described is the process of designing, road-testing and clinic-testing a new small car destined for the American market. 790667. A Better Mousetrap. Richard L. Mugg, Volks- wagen of America, Inc. Past success of the Volkswagen Beetle is due largely to its basic functional design. They were marketed as small, dependable, economical cars and the American public accepted them. Future success is expected of the entire Volkswagen line because their philosophy is continued refinement and improvement of the product. 790668. Development of the N-Type Runflat Tire and Its Evaluation in Vehicle Dynamics. Keiichiro Yabuta and Hiroaki Nishimura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Judging from viewpoint of automotive safety and more space by eliminating a spare tire, the development of the run-flat tires is important. Many problems relating to weight increase and usability had to be solved in the course of the devel- opment of such tires. The "N" type run-flat tire, described in this paper, has a simple structure with reinforced side walls and addi- tional beads to fit the rim flanges. Though this tire system brought about a small amount of weight increase, it needs no special part, therefore the conventional road wheels, air valves and tire changers may be used. We have tested and evaluated this tire system equipped with passenger cars as well as on the test machines. Especially vehicle dynamics such as steering, stability and so forth were tested. 104</page><page sequence="88">790669-790678 The test results indicated that this tire system is practical enough. 790669. The Moulding of Wood Fibre by the 'Fibriť Process. H. G. Bennett, British Moulded Fibre Ltd. The moulding of wood fibre by the 'Fibriť process uses one of our most basic raw materials, namely indigenous timber, and converts it to components of complex three-dimensional form, ideally suited to many areas of interior trim in the automotive industry. In our present energy-conscious era, wood fibre has the major attraction of being a raw material having no oil-based origin; also, on an environmental basis, showing great advantages when considering the disposal problems of materials at the end of their useful life. This paper is intended to outline the process, its history, and explain the material's functional possibilities and advantages in certain applications. 790670. Engineering Design Requirements for Thin Sec- tion Reinforced Nylon Exterior Body Parts. Herman de Haan and R. C. Sekhar, Allied Chemical Corporation, Fibers Division. Rapidly expanding use of reinforced nylon for rigid exterior painted automotive panels and components has created a need for more complete understanding of the engineering and design principles that must be applied. Dimensional changes that occur with nylon are deter- minate and therefore must be considered to avoid warpage due to differential expansion when designing the part. Methods for determining stresses, critical buckling loads and their application to components are reviewed together with experimental results. 790671. Mechanical Properties Characterization of an SMC-R50 Composite. Douglas L. Denton, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Technical Cen- ter, Granville, OH. Materials scientists and design engineers considering the use of composites molded from sheet molding compound (SMC) for structural applications need reliable mechan- ical property data for these composites. In response to this need, the mechanical properties of a well documented, carefully prepared SMC-R50 composite over a temper- ature range of -40°C to 121 °C are reported. The properties determined include engineering constants (Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio), thermal coefficient of expansion, tensile fatigue, tensile creep, and ultimate strengths in tension, compression, shear and flexure. All tests are based on one composite material, thus, conclusions about the relationship between different mechanical properties can be made. For exam- ple, the tensile and compressive moduli of SMC-R50 composite are virtually the same. Also, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio, obey an established equation relating these constants. In addition, this study establishes the existence of a fatigue limit for SMC-R50 composite. 1979 SA E Transactions 790673. Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Rolling Noise in a Passenger Car. P. Beuzit, P. Fontanet and J. L. Gamier, Régie Nationale des Usines Renault (France).

It shows vibration coupling between train, body and cavity modes and it points out different possibilities to reduce noise in the passenger compartment. 790676. Kinetic Wall Quenching of Methanol Flames with Applications to Spark Ignition Engines. L. H. Browning and R. K. Pefley, Univ. of Santa Clara. A computer model was used to predict perpendicular flame quenching distances for methanol-air mixtures at a variety of conditions. A detailed kinetic reaction mech- anism has allowed the study of aldehyde formation. Aldehydes were found to increase an order of magnitude over bulk gas concentrations as the flame quenches but this concentration is insufficient to account for measured exhaust aldehydes. A flow reactor study showed additional aldehydes being formed from the unburned quench layer when it mixes with the hot exhaust gases during the expansion and exhaust strokes. Quenching distance decreases with increasing pressure and increasing wall temperature, and increases with lean and very rich equivalence ratios and increasing exhaust gas recirculation. Water addition shows only a slight increase in quenching distance for up to 30% of the fuel by volume. 1979 SA E Transactions 790677. A Comparison of Hydrogen and Propane Fueling of an Internal Combustion Engine. Richard K. Koelsch, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY; and Stanley J. Clark, Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS. An LP-gas industrial engine was adapted for operation on hydrogen or LP-gas so that a comparative analysis of the two fuels could be made. Several alterations were made to the engine to allow operation on hydrogen without backfiring. Performance and cylinder pressures of the engine on the two separate fuels was evaluated under various conditions. The effect on engine performance of water induction for controlling backfiring was also studied. The basic intent of the research program was to evaluate the use of hydrogen for an agricultural engine application. 790678. The Influence of Hydrogen Addition to the Air-Fuel Mixture on Otto Engine Combustion. W. Jordan, Bosch und Pierburg System oHG 105</page><page sequence="89">790679-790683 (West Germany). By means of experimental analyses, which were carried out at the chair of Internal Combustion Engines of the University of Kaiserslautern, it could be demonstrated that it is possible to operate an Otto-engine without throttling, at a very high air-fuel ratio by adding hydrogen to the intake air. Due to the very lean mixture extremely low exhaust pollution at part load could be noted. 790679. The Correlation of Vehicle Characteristics with Seatbelt Usage Rates in Saskatchewan. A. T. Bergan, D. K. Lischynski, L. G. Watson and D. E. Rivett, Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; and A. C. Shiels, Transportation Agency of Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskat- chewan. From May, 1977 to May, 1978, the Transportation Centre, University of Saskatchewan conducted four surveys to determine seatbelt usage rates in Saskatchewan. The surveys were conducted prior to and after the passage of a law on July 1, 1977, requiring seatbelt use by front seat occupants of motor vehicles. The surveys were conducted at sampling stations on urban streets, provincial highways and municipal roads. The results of the May, 1978 survey were analyzed to determine what relationships exist between usage rates and various vehicle characteristics. Usage rates when examined using cross-tabulations appeared higher for certain types of vehicles: compact or sub-compact vehicles, foreign models, etc. However, when the data were analyzed using multiple regression techniques, only the year of vehicle manu- facture showed a consistently high level of significance. 790680. Safety Performance Evaluation of Seat Belt Retractors. Murray Dance, Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Branch, Transport Can- ada; and Bert Enserink, Dynamic Science, Inc. This paper discusses seat belt emergency locking retractor performance as measured in a sample of forty-four automobile models (1976-1978) sold in Canada and subjected to 30-mph frontal barrier crash tests. Parameters such as retractor lockup time, belt payout, and belt stretch were measured and correlated with injury criteria deter- mined using 49 CFR, Part 572 anthropomorphic dum- mies. The vehicles ranged from subcompacts to full-size cars. Results indicate that, in a 30-mph frontal barrier test, the retractors are locking at onset of dummy movement. However, the driver dummy can, and will, strike the steering wheel and column. The passenger dummy can strike the dash. The impact forces are attenuated by the belt system, however, and do not appear to be life threatening based on criteria contained in Canada and U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 (Occupant Crash Protection). The testing discussed in this paper was performed by Calspan and Dynamic Science under contract with Transport Canada, Road Safety Branch. 790681. Improving Safety Belt Acceptability to the Con- sumer. Peter N. Ziegler and P. Robert Knaff, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. Currently, consumers must contend with many comfort and convenience problems whenever they use a manually operated ("active") safety belt. Such problems are prev- alent not only in older models but in new cars as well. Beginning with 1982 models, most auto manufacturers plan to install automatic safety belts to meet new Federal requirements for passive occupant protection. To reduce the likelihood of consumer rejection and non-use of automatic as well as manual belt systems, research has been conducted to develop performance specifications for improved comfort and convenience. This paper discusses specifications and criteria to improve the safety belts by reducing comfort and convenience variables for both manual and automatic systems. 790682. Assessment of Seat Belt Usage - Methods/Re- sults/Recommendations. H. George Johannessen, Hamill Manufacturing Co., Div. of the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., George F. Johannessen, Avis Rent-a-Car Systems, Inc.; and Charles H. Pulley, American Seat Belt Council. Seat belts have been shown to be effective in reducing car crash fatalities and injuries. Their increased usage must be effectively promoted to obtain the available individual and societal benefits. Factors that may increase and maintain seat belt usage are identified as (1) the car occupant's perception of the effectiveness of seat belts, and (2) the comfort and convenience of his installed system. The effects of automatic seat belts and mandatory seat belt use laws are considered. 790683. Seat Belt Laws: Implications for Occupant Pro- tection. Allan F. Williams and Brian O'Neill, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Laws requiring seat belt use have had some limited success in reducing occupant fatalities. However, fatality reductions have been considerably less than expected from the reported increases in belt use rates because belt use by those in crashes has not increased to the same extent. Occupants most likely to be in serious crashes are least likely to increase their use of belts in response to laws. In addition, many involuntary belt users comply with belt use laws by wearing their belts incorrectly, in ways that greatly reduce their effectiveness, and many in front seats who wear belts in response to laws are susceptible to being impacted in crashes by unbelted rear seat occu- pants. The incomplete success of belt use laws does not 106</page><page sequence="90">790684-790691 reduce their importance as a countermeasure, but does reinforce the importance of providing automatic ("pas- sive") protection to vehicle occupants as an alternative or supplementary countermeasure. 790684. The Degree of Benefit of Belts in Reducing Injury - An Attempt to Explain Study Discrep- ancies. B. J. Campbell and Donald W. Reinfurt, Univ. of North Carolina, Highway Safety Re- search Center. Numerous analyses of accident injury data have tried to assess safety belt benefits, but they have not been able to reflect a consensus on the degree of these benefits. This paper examines seventeen safety belt studies to identify the possible causes for the disparate assessments. Factors that contribute to this disparity include differences in injury scale values, inaccuracies in reporting occupants' belt status, and variations in sampling criteria. 1979 SA E Transactions 790685. Selection Biases in the Sampling and Meas- urement of Safety Belt Use. Michael G. Dworkin, Lincorp Research, Inc. This paper describes a study of observed safety belt use conducted in the Detroit area in 1977 in conjunction with an effort sponsored by the domestic auto manufacturers to increase use through mass communications techniques. The study methodology incorporated a sophisticated sample design and very stringently controlled procedures utilizing 224 observation sites, in contrast to most other studies, which have used non-objective sample designs and procedures, and relatively few sites. Formal proofs are presented showing the possibility of generating sample selection biases when using few sites that may exclude some groups of drivers. Biased estimates of change are also shown to be possible, even when using the same few sites in repeated studies. Finally, the Detroit study is compared with one conducted concurrently by NHTSA, which utilized less rigorous methods and relatively few sites. The differences between the two studies' results are attributed to sample selection biases in the NHTSA methodology. 790686. Planning a Usage Survey for a New Seat Belt System. Arthur C. Wolfe and James O'Day, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. This paper discusses and presents recommendations on three issues in designing a usage survey for a new or experimental seat belt system. These are choice of an appropriate survey method, choice of an appropriate sampling frame and survey respondent, and choice of appropriate belt usage questions. 790687. A Comparative Analysis of Factors Impacting on Seat Belt Use. Timothy J. Kuechenmeister, General Motors Corp.; Andrew J. Morrison and Mitchell E. Cohen, Market Opinion Research. A national survey of 1500 adults and 500 adolescents identified the major factors impacting on seat belt use. Particular attention was paid to the important role interpersonal interaction and instruction plays instigating and reinforcing seat belt use. The importance of inter- personal interaction was assessed relative to the impact of demographic variables, perceptions of seat belt comfort and convenience, attitudes concerning seat belt use, and the establishment of the seat belt "habit." 790689. An Ultrasonic Flowmeter for Measurement of Gas Velocity and Temperature in Intake and Exhaust of an Internal Combustion Engine. P. A. Lakshminarayananan, P. A. Janakiraman, M. K. Gajendra Babu and B. S. Murthy, Internal Combustion Engines Lab., Indian Institute of Technology (Madras/India). This paper deals with the measurement of transient exhaust gas velocity and temperature simultaneously under motoring and firing conditions in an internal combustion engine, using a new ultrasonic velocity temperature meter. The performance of the ultrasonic meter was compared with the well known spark discharge velocity meter and the wire resistance thermometer, under dynamic conditions. The experimental results presented here were used to substantiate the mathematical model evolved for studying gas exchange processess in internal combustion engines. 1979 SA E Transactions 790690. Chromatographic Methods of Analysis for Methanol and Ethanol in Automotive Exhaust. Clarence J. Raibie and Frank W. Cox, Dept. of Energy. A gas-liquid chromatographic system designed for anal- ysis of methanol in exhaust from methanol/gasoline fueled vehicles is described. Modifications of this system for liquid analysis of methanol in gasoline, and analysis of ethanol in exhaust from ethanol/gasoline fueled vehicles are also discussed. Some results for methanol in exhaust from neat methanol and methanol/gasoline fueled vehi- cles are presented, and are compared to emissions measured by a total hydrocarbon analyzer using flame ionization detection. 1979 SA E Transactions 790691. Nitrogen Dioxide in Engine Exhaust. John C. Hilliard, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. Sciences, Wayne State Univ.; and Richard W. Wheeler, Ricardo Consulting Engrs. Ltd. (Sussex/ England). Nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel and gasoline internal combustion engines have been measured over a range of speed, load and AFR conditions. Measured N02 levels are very much higher than expected thermodynamically, with as much as 30% of the 107</page><page sequence="91">790692-790699 NOx emission from a diesel engine at 15% load in the form of N02. Stainless steel surfaces, platinum and copper chromíte catalysts, when in the temperature range 400 -&gt; 500°C have been shown to oxidise NO to N02 provided the CO concentration in the exhaust gas is below 0.1%. Analytical techniques and methods of removing N02 have been considered. 1979 SA E Transactions 790692. The Application of Lag-Process in Prechamber Engines. L. A. Gussak, V. P. Karpov and Yu. V. Tikhonov, Inst, of Chemical Physics, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Moscow. The paper deals with the effect of some design and controlling parameters of a prechamber engine on com- bustion and operation. The lowest delay in the working mixture ignition, the highest rate and completeness of the burning, the widest stability limits for combustion of lean mixtures, the lowest octane requirements and emission toxicity are obtained only within definite changes in prechamber and combustion chamber volumes (2-3%), in the overall outlet channel cross-section area (0.03-0.04 cm2/cm3 of prechamber volume) and in the air excess coefficient of the resulting auxiliary mixture (0.4 to 0.7), in the wide range of the working mixture air excess and throttling. 1979 SA E Transactions 790694. Measurements of Unregulated Emissions from General Motors' Light-Duty Vehicles. Steven H. Cadle, George J. Nebel and Ronald L. Williams, Environmental Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Sampling and analysis methods for unregulated exhaust constituents are discussed. Emission results for more than fifteen exhaust constituents from both gasoline- and diesel-powered automobiles are presented. It is shown that the catalytic converter substantially lowers the emission rates of aldehydes, benzene, benzo(a)-pyrene, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen dioxide. However, under certain rich-malfunction conditions, small increases in hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia occur. Particulate emissions are the primary concern for diesels since other unregulated emissions occur at the same low levels as from gasoline-powered vehicles. It is concluded that although steady improvements in chemical analysis technology have led to the detection of more and more minor impurities in exhaust, none of these sub- stances are emitted at concentrations that can be consid- ered dangerous. 1979 SA E Transactions 790696. Regulated and Unregulated Exhaust Emissions from Malfunctioning Automobiles. Charles M. Urban, Southwest Research Inst.; and Robert J. Garbe, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper summarizes a laboratory effort to characterize exhaust emissions from non-catalyst and oxidation cata- lyst-equipped gasoline automobiles operating under mal- function conditions. One non-catalyst and four catalyst automobiles were evaluated over three test cycles in an unmodified configuration and in four engine and/or emission control system malfunction configurations. Exhaust emission constituents measured, in addition to the currently regulated automobile emissions, include: particulates, sulfates, aldehydes, sulfides, amines, metals, and several additional elements and compounds. 1979 SA E Transactions 790697. The General Motors 2.8 Liter 60° V-6 Engine Designed by Chevrolet. David A. Martens, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The 2.8 liter 60° V-6 engine discussed here is an all new design made specifically for the 1980 Citation type of GM vehicle. This paper describes the technical features of the engine, and some of the development problems encoun- tered and how they were solved. It also touches on the durability testing of the components and the total assembly. Paramount design goals for this engine were, from the outset, maximum reliability with minimum weight. Fur- ther, compactness of the total dressed engine assembly was dictated by size and configuration of the drive train compartment in the vehicle. Serviceability, tooling, and possible future displacement and material changes also were important factors. Extensive engine testing has demonstrated the desired reliability, as well as very good power and specific fuel consumption. The overall weight, with the use of cast iron in both the cylinder heads and the block, fulfills the design goals. 790698. Piston Rings for Passenger Car Engines. Edward J. Murray, Hepworth &amp; Grandage Ltd. (West Y orkshire/England). The design of piston rings for the small engines in common use in Europe is reviewed and it is shown that optimum ring packs are achieved by careful attention to detail. Ring materials are included and the usefulness of carbidic malleable iron is demonstrated for top ring application. Details are given of analyses of friction effects of piston rings and the results are applied to interpret the future trend in oil control ring design. The problem of measuring piston ring loads is discussed and a new alternative measurement system is described. 1979 SA E Transactions 790699. Serpentine - Extended Life Accessory Drive. R. L. Cassidy, Supervisor Powertrain &amp; Chassis PEO, Ford Motor Company; S. K. Fan and R. S. MacDonald, Powertrain &amp; Chassis PEO, Ford 108</page><page sequence="92">790700-790705 Motor Company; and W. F. Samson, Vehicle Engineering Office, Ford Motor Company. A new automotive accessory drive arrangement known as 'Serpentine Drive' has been developed. The said ar- rangement employs a single, longitudinally ribbed drive belt, "snaking" around all the accessory pulleys to provide the driving force. Belt tension is applied and maintained by an automatic tensioning device, thus, belt slippage, which contributes to belt degeneration through the wear and heat generated in the process, is virtually eliminated. Drive belt service life has been considerably increased and maintenance literally eliminated. 790700. Designing More Durable Automotive Body Struc- tures Using Plastic Models and Damage Analysis. Walter V. Corteg, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp., Robert S. Brines, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp.; and Robert J. George, The Budd Co. Half scale plastic models and strain based, cumulative damage analysis techniques were combined in the 1980 'X' compact car project at General Motors Corporation to provide a design tool to more accurately predict areas on a body structure that would require design refinement for durability. To make these techniques effective required the development and application of: plastic model build and test methods, loads, material properties and methods of analysis. Plastic models and cumulative damage analysis have contributed significantly to the durability of the 1980 'X' car light weight structure and are becoming standard structural analysis tools. 1979 SA E Transactions 790701. Modeling Large Deformations Using Poly- carbonate Scale Models. W. A. Elliott, D. E. Malen and D. R. Whittaker, General Motors Corp. This paper presents a method for modeling large defor- mations of structures using scale plastic models. The method was used to predict the dynamic barrier crash performance of a proposed vehicle structure with the aid of a computer simulation of the collision. The use of the technique can provide design direction in the early stages of the vehicle design process. 1979 SA E Transactions 790702. Plastic Carbody for an Electric Vehicle Appli- cation. G. P. McCafferty, The Budd Company Technical Center. The objective of this program was to develop a new autobody structure for a near term electric vehicle application. Design criteria for the structure specified lightweight, durable construction which was to meet current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Accomplishments on the program to date have included the conceptual and detail design, test, and prototype fabrication of an autobody structure which has been constructed almost totally from fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Parts have generally been designed to be com- patible with the sheet molding compound (SMC) process. The plastic structure has been demonstrated through sub-scale testing to be capable of meeting the 30 mph barrier crash requirements. 790703. Conduct of Mileage Accumulation and Emission Testing for the CRC/MMT Program. R. R. Carlson, R. E. Pilkington and J. L. Politzer, Systems Control, Inc. This paper describes the conduct of the Coordinating Research Council's (CRC) automotive emission test program to determine the effects of methylcyclo- pentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) octane im- provement fuel additive on hydrocarbon exhaust emis- sions. This program was performed under contract to the CRC and was supported financially by the American Petroleum Institute and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. The results of the program are presented separately. 790704. Computer Simulation Model for Forecasting Mileage Accumulation and Testing Rate. S. C. Jaquette, R. T. Curran and J. L. Politzer, Systems Control, Inc. Management of large emissions testing programs can be improved by using simulation models to predict per- formance and evaluate the effects of operational changes prior to implementation. During the Coordinating Re- search Council (CRC) methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) Field Test Program, a computer model of the mileage accumulation and testing functions of the program was developed and used to establish work schedules, project cost forecasts, and optimal scheduling of activities on individual vehicles. The principles of this model and the methods employed are based on queuing theory and can be applied to any complex vehicle test program. 790705. Simultaneous Measurement of Engine-Out and Tail Pipe Mass Emissions. J. H. Randall and R. R. Carlson, Systems Control, Inc. A unique and simple method to obtain simultaneous mass measurements of engine-out and tail pipe emissions was developed as part of the methylcyclopentadienyl man- ganese tricarbonyl (MMT) Field Test Program conducted by the Coordinating Research Council. The method and associated equipment is called the "Mini CVS." The data obtained from the Mini CVS provide a means of computing catalytic converter efficiencies without addi- tional analytical instruments. This paper describes the system concept, associated equipment, and test data obtained to demonstrate the accuracy and repeatability of the Mini CVS system. 1979 SA E Transactions 109</page><page sequence="93">790706-790712 790706. Results of Coordinating Research Council MMT Field Test Program. J. D. Benson, Fuels and Lubricants Department, General Motors Re- search Laboratories; R. J. Campion, Exxon Company U.S.A.; and L. J. Painter, Chevron Research Company. The effect of the gasoline antiknock additive, MMT, on automotive emission control systems was studied in a 63-car field test. The cars were operated for 50,000 miles, and the effects of MMT on hydrocarbon, CO and NOx emissions, catalyst plugging and spark plug life were determined. Two concentration levels of MMT in a clear base fuel were studied, 1/32 g Mn/gal and 1/16 g Mn/gal. Seven 1977-78 model year cars, all calibrated to meet California standards, were included in the statistical design. The results of this study indicate that the use of MMT at either test concentration increases both engine and tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions, compared to clear fuel. At 50K miles, the average tailpipe hydrocarbon increase was 0.09 g/mile for 1/32 MMT fuel, and 0.11 g/mile for 1/16 MMT fuel. This increase was pronounced at low mileage intervals, and significant differences continued for the duration of the test. CO and NOx emissions, catalyst plugging, and spark plug life were not affected by MMT. Discussion: Gordon A. Hughmark, Ethyl Corporation. 1979 SAE Transactions 790707. Effects of MMT on Exhaust Emissions. Jay S. Wallace and Robert J. Garbe, Emission Control Technology Div., EPA, Ann Arbor, MI. This paper describes the data review and statistical analyses performed to demonstrate that the fuel additive Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) caused or contributed, with at least 98% confidence, to the failure of motor vehicles to comply with their designed HC emission standards. Due to variations in protocols between test programs, uncertainty as to the effects of both MMT itself and initial emission levels, and vehicle- to-vehicle differences, statistical analyses were performed on eight different effect characteristics of exhaust emis- sions. One of these effect characteristics was extended to explicitly address the failure to meet standards issue. 790709. Lateral Impact - Considerations for Vehicle De- velopment. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Research and Development, Volkswagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/West Germany). The number of accident analyses involving lateral (side- on) impacts is steadily increasing. An accident simulation test procedure that is applicable worldwide must first be established in order to significantly improve the safety features of vehicles. Factors to be considered in studying lateral impacts are: the mass, structural design, and rigidity of the vehicles involved in the collision; the point and angle of impact; impact speeds; vehicle interior and design; and the use of restraints. 790710. Development of Protection Systems for Lateral Impacts. P. Ventre, J. Provensal and G. Stcherbatcheff, Régie Nationale des Usines Renault. A series of 21 experimental car-to-car collisions were produced. The accelerations on the thorax and the pelvis of the dummy exposed to the impact were analyzed and related to the parameters linked to the vehicles. Two lateral collisions of a rigid, mobile barrier with a car were produced and compared to the car-to-car collisions. The parameters of the relative stiffness and of the mass of impacting vehicles and impacted vehicles were examined. The protective measures were developed for the impacted vehicle and tesied in different configurations. 1979 SA E Transactions 790711. Automotive Road Wheel Analysis Tools. Pat Glance, Autodynamics Corp. of America. This paper examines the design challenge represented by the development of the various lightweight automotive wheel programs such as HSLA, aluminum, and plastic. A survey of the various design analysis tools available are made and the phenomenon of correlation between theoretical finite element computer analysis and exper- imental analysis is investigated. The design issues of optimum weight versus fatigue life, failure detection, material properties, manufacturing stresses, work hardening, temperature sensitivity, creep, and lugnut torque retention are discussed and the new experimental tools required to monitor these issues are described. This paper describes the required link between theoretical and experimental analysis, and specifically describes the creation of the sophisticated testing systems required to accomplish these analyses. 790712. Sheet Fabricated Aluminum Wheels for Smaller Passenger Cars. Sazuku Nakamura, Yoshio Takeshima and Masao Ito, Research Labs., Sumitomo Light Metal Ind., Ltd. The developed lightweight wheels having seamless rims made of 5083 sheet range from 13 X 4.5 which weighs about 3.6 kg (7.9 lb) to 14 X 6 which weighs about 4.7 kg (10.4 lb). These are from about 15 kg (6.8 lb) to about 20 kg (9.1 lb) per set lighter than steel production wheels. The wheels composed of stamped spider and seamless rims are joined by MIG welding and then stabilized by thermal treatment. Therefore, these not only meet the performance requirements on dynamic cornering/radial fatigue test (SAE J328a), impact test (SAE J 175), push out test and nut fastening test (JASO 608), but also have enough stress-corrosion resistance. 110</page><page sequence="94">790713-790720 790713. Road Stress Resistance and Lightweight Con- struction of Automobile Road Wheels. Anton Wimmer and Jürgen Petersen, AUDI NSU (Ingolstadt/West Germany). The need to save energy and protect the environment requires a reduction in fuel consumption. Fuel can be saved by reducing the weight of the vehicle. Weight reduction is only possible if the engineer possesses an exact knowledge of the stresses involved. A statistical analysis was therefore made of customer driving habits and the results were used to define test specifi- cations. Using the same material, a road wheel can be made 16% lighter by designing a suitable shape to improve the flux of force and the stress resistance. Changing from steel to aluminum will reduce weight by up to 50%. 1979 SA E Transactions 790714. UNIPAC - An Independently Sprung Driving Wheel Bearing. George G. Gilbert and William E. Harbottle, The Timken Co., Canton, OH. UNIPAC is a new two row tapered roller bearing assembly that has been developed for smaller automobiles that use an independent suspension, and front wheel drive. The new two row assembly offers a complete tapered roller bearing package that is pregreased, pre- adjusted and sealed. These unique functional character- istics are required of this bearing assembly for the independently sprung driving wheel position. Each func- tional bearing requirement has been studied and tested to assure satisfactory bearing performance at the most economical bearing price. 1979 SA E Transactions 790715. Brake Lining Mechanical Properties, Laboratory Specimen Studies. A. E. Anderson and R. A. Knapp, Ford Motor Có. All automotive brake linings have mechanical strength and thermal expansion properties which vary with orientation. This paper describes laboratory equipment and test procedures which characterize lining strength and expansion behavior, using small specimens. A benchtop testing device is introduced which can be used to perform shear and tensile tests on lining samples and singly-riveted lining assemblies. Results are presented for a represen- tative group of production and experimental linings. Applications are discussed. 790716. Friction Material Riveting Studies - Load-De- flection Characteristics and Finite Element Mod- eling. R. A. Knapp and A. E. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. Experimental load-deflection data for rivets alone and for complete shoe and lining assemblies are presented and discussed. Comparisons are made between conventional taper head and umbrella head rivet designs, as well as a new tapered shank rivet design. Finite element modeling of the friction material in the area around a rivet is presented to help evaluate the stress field for different rivet head configurations, with orthotropic or isotropic elastic properties assumed for the friction material. 1979 SA E Transactions 790717. Controlled Friction Additives for Brake Pads and Clutches. Harry M. Schiefer and George V. Kubczak, Dow Corning Corp. The elimination of asbestos in brake and clutch compo- sitions, as well as the use of smaller brake pads for down-sized and compact cars, has produced new re- quirements for friction lining materials. The emerging semi-metallic compositions generally need some friction modifiers to reduce squeal and wear and to produce friction characteristics that are less dependent on tem- perature. In Europe MoS2 has been utilized as a friction modifier for harder brake pad compositions for many years, but provided only limited improvements. Research on solid friction control additives at Dow Corning has produced new technology by which friction and wear properties can be tailored to specific requirements of the friction lining industry. This material has been evaluated in a number of brake and clutch compositions at a level of from one to six weight percent. The additive was found to provide one or more of the requirements of new brake design, such as reduced noise level, less disc wear and less change of friction with temp. 790718. Chrysler's Advance Body Engineering's Utili- zation of Computer Aided Design. Timothy R. Lundell, Chrysler Corp. Chrysler Engineering's Advance Body Design Depart- ments have utilized computer aided design (CAD) to improve design hand-offs, provide background data for structural analysis, and provide tapes for numerical controlled milling of inner and outer panels. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of CAD applications within Advance Body. 790719. The Relationship Between Product Planning and Product Design. Richard E. Fancy, General Motors Technical Center. This paper discusses the primary roles of product planners and product designers with the intent of demonstrating their differences and inter-relationships in the design process.

Hamon and G. Perroud, Peugeot; and S. Parizot, Citroën. This paper discusses from the view point of Peugeot- 111</page><page sequence="95">790721-790726 Citroën, the main advantages and the practical appli- cations of C.A.D. (Computer Aided Design), concerning the design and manufacturing of their latest models, such as 305, CX, 604, Visa ... Numerical definition of complex surfaces has helped the stylists considerably: - machining of first models from a draft, - local modifications, - milling of the model for approval. Some internal structure elements can be automatically designed from the numerical external shape. This allows check of possible interference between mechanical ele- ments and the internal structure. High feed rate numerical milling machines for soft materials allow an easy machining of prototype dies, master models and scale models for aerodynamic studies. Numerical design of parts is also used for the direct milling of stamping tools and the manufacturing of injection moulds for plastic elements that take account automatically of the shrinkage. The conclusions will emphasize the benefit obtained on the latest cars, concerning quality, time and cost. 790721. Design for Fuel Economy - The New GM Front Drive Cars. F. C. Porter, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The techniques for optimization of fuel economy in the design of the new GM 1980 "X" cars involved reduction of road load and parasitic losses combined with power train matching to the vehicle as a system. Computer simulations identified potential fruitful areas of economy improvement. The method of establishing meaningful targets for weight, aerodynamics and tire losses is described. Matching of engine displacement, torque converter characteristics and transmission and axle gearing to the vehicle system made possible the minimum engine size consistent with target performance require- ments. It is concluded that the methods employed made possible a high level of fuel efficiency relative to both vehicle size and performance. 790722. Electric Cooling Fan with High Ram Airflow - A Fuel Economy Improvement. Terranee D. Laise, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; Robert C. Mellin and Richard E. Longhouse, General Motors Research Labs., General Mo- tors Corp.; and Bohdan I. Pryjmak, Delco Products Div., General Motors Corp. The 1980 X-Car engine cooling system is designed to aid in maximizing fuel economy. An electrically driven fan was selected to provide airflow to meet the above objective. Several other design objectives such as light weight and low noise level are also very well satisfied by the elctric fan. This paper describes the strategy and techniques used to meet the fuel economy improvement goal while still providing acceptable engine cooling and the airflow required for adequate air conditioning con- densing. This strategy consisted of maximizing ram airflow via methods of wind tunnel, flowmeter and on road development. The heat exchangers were then sized to perform adequately with only ram airflow in a road load condition. Finally the additional airflow required at idle and at high heat rejection points was determined. A high peak efficiency fan was selected to provide the airflow needed when operating near its maximum efficiency. 790723. Measurement and Reduction of On-Road Brake Drag. Charles T. (Ted) Hoffman, Jr., Delco Moraine Div., GMC; and Douglas J. Beurmann, Chevrolet Engineering, GMPG, GMC. A new, light weight, front disc brake caliper design, referred to as a "3200" series, has been developed for use on the new, smaller, front-wheel drive vehicles. Features include reduced rotor drag and optimum utilization of weight vs. strength. In addition to the new caliper, a transducer capable of measuring vehicle brake drag on the road has been developed and successfully applied. 790724. An Effective Aerodynamic Program in the Design of a New Car. Lloyd Nedley, Chevrolet Motor Div. The design of the 1980 General Motors front- wheel drive car received the most comprehensive aerodynamic anal- ysis of any vehicle in corporation history. In addition, the aero study began at an earlier date in the design program than any previous GM car. The result was a design with the lowest aerodynamic drag when compared to a representative cross section of domestic and import family-type cars being marketed today. The final outcome was a substantial fuel economy benefit on the road and on the EPA test. 790725. A New Automatic Transmission for Improved Fuel Economy - General Motors THM 125. Erkki A. Koivunen and Philip A. Le Bar, Jr., Hydra-matic Division, General Motors Cor- poration. A lightweight, more fuel-efficient three-speed automatic transmission has been introduced by Hydra-matic Divi- sion of General Motors Corporation for the new, totally redesigned 1980 X-car line. The transmission has a two-axis construction and also contains the planetary gear final drive and differential gear units. Many unique features, such as optimized torque converter, variable capacity pump, and wide ratio gearing are included to increase its efficiency. 790726. A Fuel Saving Passenger Tire. H. D.

Designed exper- 112</page><page sequence="96">790727-790731 iments, special experimental setups, and novel statistical methods were used to maximize the information obtain- able from experimental tires. A reduction of more than 20% in the rolling resistance of the subject tires, size P185/80R-13, was achieved within stated design parameters, while performance properties were maintained. 1979 SAE Transactions 790727. Low Temperature Starting and Pumpability Re- quirements of European Automotive Engines. C. G. A. Eberan-Eberhorst, Deutsche BP AG; C. Neveu, Rohm and Haas France SA; A. Rossi, Total; and M. Thompson, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd. European motor manufacturer replies to the SAE Ques- tionnaire on low temperature starting and pumpability indicate that - low temperature oil viscosity and flow requirements are primarily determined by engine design. - CCS viscosities give a useful guide to the cold starting properties of lubricants in European engines. - there is interest in a classification system which combines viscosity at temperatures lower than -18°C and oil pumpability. Experimental test programmes using motored German and French engines confirm that oil pumpability char- acteristics are largely determined by engine design but show that oil viscosity and VI improver-type additives also have an effect on pumpability. Independent pumpability rig tests show that oil flow rate at -20° C is markedly influenced by the incorporation of an oil filter in the oil circuit. For both engine and rig tests, the correlation between oil pumpability performance and laboratory test results is investigated. These studies suggest that, although a standardised rig test to predict oil pumpability may be desirable in the future, there will be considerable difficulty in establishing a procedure which correlates well with the broad range of engine designs currently available in Europe. 790728. Effect of Engine Oil Viscosity on Low-Temper- ature Cranking, Starting, and Fuel Economy. F. Caracciolo and M. L. McMillan, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The effect of engine oil viscosity on low-temperature cranking, starting, and vehicle fuel economy at low ambient temperatures was determined for vehicles equipped with four- and eight-cylinder engines. Oils ranging in SAE viscosity grade from 5W-20 to 30 were investigated at temperatures between -40 and -12°C. For both vehicles, engine cranking speed increased with decreasing Cold Cranking Simulator (CCS) viscosity. This was reflected in easier starting with lower viscosity oils. In addition, the maximum viscosity for successful engine starting decreased as the temperature decreased. Fuel economy during engine warm-up increased with decreasing CCS viscosity, with the friction-modified oils investigated providing better fuel economy during warm- up and easier low-temperature starting. 790729. Cold Starting and Oil Pumpability - An Evalu- ation of New and Used Oils in Gasoline Engines. W. H. Stover, Research Dept., Imperial Oil Ltd., Sarnia, Ontario. Cold starting and oil pumpability were studied in a controlled field test with new and used oils. Minimum starting temperatures and the corresponding oil viscosities were established for vehicles with four, six and eight cylinder engines. Oil pumping characteristics following a cold start were also defined. It was found that a lower oil viscosity was required as the starting temperature went down to compensate for loss of battery output. The "critical" starting viscosities were always lowest for the four cylinder engine, suggesting that new CCS viscosity specifications should be based on the needs of small engines. The benefits for using a 5W rather than a 10W lubricant were modest (2-3 °C) as were the increases in minimum starting temperatures with a used oil. The six cylinder engine was the most critical with respect to oil pumpability, probably because it had the longest oil pickup tube. A 10W/30 lubricant had better pumping characteristics in this engine than predicted by low shear visometers. 790730. Measurement of the Ring to Liner Oil Film Thickness in a Caterpillar 1-G Diesel Engine. S. L. Moore, Dept. of Engrg., Univ. of Reading (England). Capacitance film thickness transducers have been devel- oped which, when fitted into the cylinder liner of a diesel engine, enable the operating profile of the piston ring and the ring to liner oil film thickness to be obtained. The construction and operation of the gauges are described and some measurements are presented from the mid- stroke and top-dead-centre positions in a Caterpillar 1-G oil test engine. 790731. Laboratory Testing of Fuel Efficient Oils. Wildrick Hart, Witco Chemical Corporation; and E. E. Klaus, Pennsylvania State University. This paper describes a laboratory dynamometer/engine test procedure for acquiring fuel consumption data under a variety of operating conditions. A unique part of this procedure is the evaluation of fuel consumption at two jacket temperatures. This permits an evaluation of changes in viscosity without changing the oil. The ratio of fuel consumption at low temperature to that at high temperature has been defined as Viscosity Sensitivity Index (VSI). If fuel consumption increases with increased temperature (neg. VSI), a large hydrodynamic lubrication component is in evidence. If fuel consumption decreases 113</page><page sequence="97">790732-790739 with increased temperature (pos. VSI), boundary lubri- cation has increased. By this technique, engine condition and oil effects such as relative film thickness, apparent viscosity, and friction modifier effectiveness can be evaluated. Discussion: T. F.

Harold Shaub, Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Products Research Division, Linden, NJ; Marvin F. Smith, Exxon Chemical Company, Paramins Technology Division, Linden, NJ; and Chester K. Murphy, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. A new viscometer, the Mini-Rotary Viscometer (MRV), has been demonstrated to predict the low temperature pumpability performance of engine oils. This bench test method was developed at the request of SAE Fuels and Lubricants Subcommittee 2 and culminates a two-part ASTM Program to (1) define pumpability characteristics of reference oils in engines and (2) assess/develop bench test methods for predicting low temperature engine pumpability. The MRV is a low shear stress/shear rate viscometer that correlates either with an "average" engine or an individual engine, depending upon the critical Theological requirements of the particular engine or engines, and attains its high degree of correlation by predicting either of two failure modes - air binding of the pump or insufficient oil flow rate to the oil pump inlet. Thus, the MRV complements the Cold Cranking Simulator, a high shear stress device, in defining the low temperature behavior of straight-grade and multigrade engine oils. Discussion: Ross M.

James O'Day and Richard Kaplan, Univ. of Michigan, Highway Safety Research Inst., Ann Arbor, MI. Information on side impact fatal accident cases has been extracted from the NHTSA's 1977 Fatal Accident Re- porting System (FARS) files, combined with parallel information from the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), and used to estimate the relative frequency of various kinds of side impact collisions. The analysis has been restricted to passenger cars to estimate the number of fatalities, the total number of occupants in all towaway crashes, and the ratio of these two numbers. Data are shown for (1) right and left side impacts, (2) for vehicles impacted by other cars, by trucks, or by fixed objects, and (3) for drivers vs. other seated positions. About 60% of the side-impact fatalities in passenger cars in the U.S. occur as the result of the car being struck by a truck or striking a fixed object; most of the other 40% result from impact by another passenger car. A principal purpose of this analysis was to assess the value of the FARS data in providing an understanding of a particular accident type, and the conclusion is drawn that FARS is useful now, and is likely to be more so in the future. Since it contains the census of fatal highway accidents in the U.S., conclusions drawn from this file are limited only by inaccuracies in the data and not by statistical sampling considerations. 790737. The Concept of Suspension and Steering System for the New Datsun 280ZX. Tokio Yoshikura, Yasuhiko Fujiwara, Tsuneo Endo and Yoshio Fukai, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The Datsun 280Z has been widely known as a world-wide sports car. The new Datsun 280ZX, as the succeeding model to 280Z, has now appeared after being refined on both interior and exterior design. The suspension and steering system of the new model are improved to get better handling performance and lower noise level. In this paper, the design concepts and techniques of the new suspension and steering system are described. The main themes are as follows: •the construction of new suspension and steering system •handling performance •directional stability •vibration and noise level 790738. A Speed Sensitive Variable Assistance Power Steering System. Masao Nishikawa, Yoshihiko Toshimitsu and Takashi Aoki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The paper describes the variable assistance power steering system introduced on the 1978 Honda Accord LX. The system provides full power assist at parking speeds, with a gradual decrease in assistance with increasing vehicle speed, giving a normal unassisted "road feel" at highway speeds. The system eliminates sudden changes in steering effort at highway speeds, due to power source failure. Particular attention was given to ensure a 'fail safe' condition in the event of a malfunction of any part of the system and specifically the speed sensing mechanism. 1979 SAE Transactions 790739. Analysis of Steering Force at Low Speed. Iwao Nakamura and Kazuo Ikawa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. From the view point of vehicle weight reduction and saving resources, it would be desirable to decrease the steering effort eliminating the assistance of power. Therefore, we have analyzed the steering effort at low vehicle speeds where steering effort is great, and have 114</page><page sequence="98">790740-790745 introduced a theoretical model based on the contact surface deflection recovering process of rolling tires. This deflection comes from the lateral rigidity and the total deflection of tires. The following results were obtained from this study. As the vehicle speed increases, the steering effort de- creases exponentially. As the steering speed increases or as the vehicle speed decreases, the steering effort increases and the effort approaches the final value which equals the static steering effort. The static steering effort is not relative to steering speed. These theoretical results are supported by vehicle experiments. 790740. Driver-Vehicle Interaction with Respect to Steering Controllability. Friedrich O. Jaksch, AB Volvo (Gothenburg/Sweden). The vehicle characteristics of two vehicles have been changed by various means. Steering control quality has then been investigated with the help of lane change manoeuvres. The investigation comprises both theoretical analyses and experimental tests. The tests comprise measuring of vehicle characteristics, subjective rating of steering control quality and measuring of performance of the system driver-vehicle, regarding the ability to follow a predicted course. Results have shown that there is a strong relationship between yaw velocity response time, steering wheel angle gradient, steering wheel torque gradient and subjective rating. The results also show that yaw velocity response time is the dominating factor and greatly influences steering control quality in transient steering manoeuvres, with relatively high lateral acceleration. 1979 SA E Transactions 790741. Grid Circle Analyzer - Computer Aided Meas- urement of Deformation. Robert A. Ayres, Earl G. Brewer and Steven W. Holland, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The grid circle method of measuring strain in a sheet metal stamping is necessary for understanding form- ability. However, this method has primarily been limited to use as a research tool because of the slow, tedious measurements required to measure strain from each deformed circle. An automatic method of measuring strains has been developed which combines a solid state camera with a minicomputer to calculate a best fit ellipse through each deformed circle. The computer calculates and prints the major and minor strain. The accuracy of this automatic system is comparable to measurements made from a toolmaker's microscope and is -3 times faster. Furthermore, it is not necessary to first section large stampings to read strains. These advantages give this new method the ability to rapidly read strains at the press shop to aid in implementing technological advances. 1979 SA E Transactions 790742. Forďs 1980 Central Fuel Injection System. G. H. Czadzeck, Electronic Fuel Systems; and R. A. Reid, Small V8 Engine Systems, Ford Motor Company. This paper represents a functional description of the 1980 production Central Fuel Injection (CFI) system as designed and developed by Ford Motor Company for passenger car application. This CFI system is unique in that it represents Ford's first introduction into total electronic fuel control as well as utilizing digital instead of analog computer technology. The paper addresses three distinct areas: •System description which includes component iden- tification, vehicle component packaging, and a macro explanation of total system function. •Detail description of individual component archi- tecture. •Description of the control strategy depicting com- ponent interrelationships and engine/vehicle require- ments. This will include both closed loop and open loop control modes. 790743. An Electronic Carburetor Controller. Shigeo Aono, Akio Hosaka and Mitsumasa Inoue, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An electronically controlled closed-loop carburetor sys- tem has been developed for production application in Datsun car models. Providing a means of complying with Japanese Emission Standards, this design features the electronic control of carburetor supplied fuel with signif- icantly improved emission performance and fuel econ- omy. Technological advances include the noteworthy com- pensation of oxygen sensor output variations and im- proved transient emission. 790744. Axle Efficiency - Test Procedures and Results. D. E.

Positive benefits by the use of oil soluble friction modifiers are shown. 790746. European Experience with Fuel Efficient Gear Oils. B. M. O'Connor, R. Graham and I. Glover, The Lubrizol Corporation. In recent years, fuel economy investigations in U.S. vehicles have increased as a result of government regulations imposed on auto manufacturers due to a realization of the need for petroleum conservation. Through the use of a variety of test and operational conditions in the U.S., it has been shown that using selected gear lubricants gives significant improvements in fuel economy in commercial vehicles and passenger cars. Similar evaluations have been conducted on European commercial and passenger vehicles to confirm the ob- served fuel saving potential with selected gear lubricants. The investigation of each vehicle type has been presented separately in this paper. 790747. SAE Vibration Test for Motor Vehicle Lighting Devices and Components. Donald D. Walker, Body and Electrical Product Engrg., Ford Motor Co. A new laboratory test specification was developed through vibration measurements at various locations on selected vehicles including trucks. Various alternatives for laboratory test equipment and test procedures were also studied. While the new specification addresses two major shortcomings of the previous test - repeatability and improved correlation of loads between the field and test - it is not possible for a single vibration test to represent the vibration spectrum for all lamps mounted at all locations for all vehicles including heavy trucks. Because there are many manufacturers of lighting com- ponents - some of which are relatively small companies - only relatively simple and readily available vibration test equipment was considered for the new procedure. For some of the passenger car locations, the measured vibration amplitude was only one-sixth the vibration level specified in this specification. However, because many lighting devices are designed and manufactured for general usage, the vibration spectrum for the laboratory test was selected to approximate the highest measured levels. Multiple test levels would be required to better approximate the vibration spectrum for all vehicles. This was judged not to be necessary, however, because lamp design is generally not dictated by fatigue life consid- erations. While this laboratory test specification does not provide complete correlation between the laboratory and the field, it is sufficient to detect major design deficiencies and structural flows and is compatible with commercially available equipment. 790748. A New Concept in Anthropomorphic Test Dum- mies for Lateral Impact. Samuel W. Alderson, Humanoid Systems. Continued progress in protection against frontal crashes has highlighted the need for increased emphasis upon lateral crashes. Existing anthropomorphic test dummies were designed for frontal crashes and yield unreliable data to guide interior vehicle design for improved lateral-crash protection. A preliminary study is reported here of new design principles which might lead to dummies which would provide more human-like data for lateral crashes, while, at the same time maintaining a capability for use in frontal crashes. This concept is based upon the substitution of rubber shoulders for the rigid, articulated mechanical linkages which constitute the skeletal structures of present dummies. This concept includes the use of plastic bones and energy-absorbing flesh sections in the upper arms. Preliminary tests indicate a basis for combining frontal- and lateral-impact capabilities in a dummy. 790750. The Need for a Force Measuring Dummy in Side Impact Testing. R. W. Lowne, S. P. F. Petty, J. Harris and C. A. Hobbs, Transport and Road Research Lab., Dept. of the Environment, Dept. of Transport (Berkshire/England). When impact tests are performed on cars to assess the level of protection afforded in side impacts it is tempting to use the test dummies which were originally designed with frontal impact in mind. However, examination of the two situations shows that side impacts, where intrusion plays a more significant part in injury causation, are sufficiently different from frontal impacts for a special test device to be needed. This paper illustrates, from crash- injury studies, the types of injury seen in side impacts. These show that forces rather than accelerations should be measured, because serious injuries can be caused by localised forces to the torso and by crushing of the pelvis. The development of a special dummy designed to measure these forces in side impacts has already been described. This dummy has been calibrated against accident data and tentative human tolerance limits have been proposed. Vehicle impact testing has been performed with this dummy over the past six years and this has shown the value of being able to measure forces. Some of the results of this testing are given. Modifications have now been made to the dummy in the light of recent cadaver testing. 790751.

Robinson, Hepworth and Grandage Ltd., St. John's Works, Bradford, West Yorkshire. Comparisons are made of methods of construction and technical performance which illustrate progress in engine design over the last 40 years, and the contribution made in development by engine component specialists. Predictive techniques and uses of specialised rig tests used in piston assembly development are described, which reduce development costs and time, and improve engine reliability. Quality control techniques are briefly com- pared and the need is shown for a greater degree of "in-process" control, to be developed in the next decade, to obtain improved quality levels with no concurrent cost increase. It is suggested that the main prime movers in use during the first two decades of the next century will still be recognisable as reciprocating engines, but that efficiencies will be improved by reduced friction and by a more efficient response to engine load demand. It is believed that in the search to conserve the world's fuel resources, and in the increasing demand for im- provements in the ecology and consumer protection, there will be an increasing demand - for the component sup- pliers. 790761. Diesel Engined, Light Duty Vehicles for an Emission Controlled Environment. C. C. J. French and D. A. Pike, Ricardo Consulting Engrs., Ltd., Bridge Works, Shoreham-by-Sea, (West Sussex/England). The diesel engined light duty vehicle shows a substantial improvement in fuel economy over its gasoline engined counterpart. It will however have very great difficulty in meeting proposed gaseous and particulate exhaust emis- sion levels. The interactions between fuel economy, NOx emis- sions, and exhaust particulate emissions as demonstrated by an extensive series of tests on a Mercedes Benz 300D car with modulated exhaust gas recirculation are corre- lated with published data from other diesel engined vehicles to predict levels which could be achieved with current technology and to estimate the fuel economy penalties. 790762. The Supercharged Diesel Engine of the Peugeot 604. M. Moulin, M. Regneault, M. Perez, M. Le Creurer and M. LeBorne, P.S. A. Peugeot- Citroen. Starting with a mass produced naturally aspirated Diesel engine, a turbo charged version has been developed for the purpose of fitting it to a passenger car. In its first part, this paper justifies and describes the modifications that have been done to the naturally aspirated engine: - Optimisation of performances to match the vehicle needs more specifically, special care has been brought to increase low rpm torque. - Improvement of mechanical and thermal charac- teristics of the engine, to withstand turbocharging. In the second part, the main problems of engine to vehicle adaptation, and their solutions, are described. Afterwards the general behaviour of the vehicle from the viewpoints of performances, fuel economy, exhaust gases pollution and noise emission, are reviewed. It is concluded that the turbocharged Diesel is of real interest. Concerning comfort, performances, fuel econ- omy, a vehicle equipped with this kind of engine can be advantageously compared to the one fitted with a much larger capacity naturally aspirated engine. 790763. (SP-445) A Practical Treatise on Engine Crank- shaft Torsional Vibration Control. Robert C. Bremer, Jr., Schwitzer, Wallace Murray Corp. Harmonic balancer, crankshaft tuner, engine dampener, front pulley, timing wheel, or more properly the engine crankshaft vibration damper: all terms used to describe probably the least understood accessory installed on nearly every heavy duty internal combustion engine made world-wide. New developments in engine and vehicle technology are placing an ever increasing burden on crankshaft dampers; and a technological lag between modern engines and available torsional control has become evident. Whether they are ready or not, engineers in the transportation/off-highway/agricultural industries will soon be called upon to take an in-depth look at what effects new technology will have on drive train torsional vibration. This paper attempts to make that look somewhat easier by way of providing a general overview on the characteristics of vibration damping, and related tech- nology. 790764.

The Economic Significance of Creative Engi- neering Activity. J. Siegfried Meurer, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg, Aktien- gesellschaft (Augsburg/West Germany). In the past it was mainly the inventions that stimulated trade and industry most vigorously which enabled the development of hitherto unknown products and processes. Experience has proved, however, that it is, in particular, these most valuable inventions which often necessitate lead times of up to 30 years during which they require intellectual and financial support until they can finally produce their positive effects. A great deal is lost in the course of this long evolution. However, inventions and research results can already be visualised today which, in the future, will open up new economic dimensions. The creative spirit behind such progress provides an incentive to highly industrialised states the importance of which has not yet been fully realised. 790767. The Use of Small Scale Wind Tunnel Data in the Design of Cab-Over-Engine Tractor /Trailer Combinations. Tim Kangas, PACCAR Technical Center, A Division of PACCAR. A critical assessment of the usefulness of small scale wind tunnel data in optimizing the design of heavy duty cab-over-engine tractor/trailer combinations is presented. The correct selection of cab leading edge radii has long been recognized as a dramatic means of reducing aerodynamic drag and hence fuel consumption. However, the validity of extrapolating small scale wind tunnel designs into full size vehicles has been a source of continuing controversy. Results of literature search and original wind tunnel studies lead to the conclusion that carefully conducted one-tenth scale wind tunnel inves- tigations can be used to select accurate and somewhat conservative full-scale designs. 1979 SA E Transactions 790768. Kenworth Airglide 100 Rear Suspension. John K. Winslow, Kenworth Truck Co. An air suspension has been developed to meet the needs of the Class 8 truck market of the 1980's. This design was developed to satisfy a list of objectives that conform to present and future requirements for a tandem axle rear suspension. Throughout the development program, ex- haustive tests were conducted to assure successful per- formance and minimize the possibility of last minute tooling changes. Dual anti-sway bars contribute signif- icantly to the dynamic performance characteristics of this suspension and, along with the full air springing, represent its most significant performance features. 790769. Compression Engine Brake Performance with Tur bochar ged Diesel Engines. W. H. Morse, Jacobs Mfg. Co.; and J. M. Rife, Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. New models of the compression engine brake deliver substantially increased retarding horsepower on high performance turbocharged diesel engines. The historical performance trends for "Jake Brake" equipped engines are shown, and the case for higher horsepower discussed. An engine cycle simulation has been used to compute the performance expected from advanced high performance engines. Retarding horsepower is expected to increase because of better use of the turbocharger during the braking cycle and because of timing changes in the engine brake. The authors propose that an advanced model of the "Jake Brake" on 855 in3 Cummins Engines will deliver nearly 550 retarding horsepower. Vehicle safety may improve, vehicle control speed will increase and higher loads will be placed on the drive-line in these applications. A challenge is presented to the vehicle, engine and engine brake designers to exploit the potential of the improved retarding. 790770. Air-to-Air Charge Air Cooling for Truck Engines. Bertil Hāggh and Ernst Holmér, Volvo Truck Corp. To improve the performance and to limit the exhaust emissions from turbocharged truck diesel engines, air- to-air charge coolers have been introduced by some manufacturers. Such systems offer the best possible efficiency at a reasonable cost, but the influence of the complete engine system must be considered when the truck is designed. 790771.

The GT601 Gas Turbine Engine has been specifically designed as a powerplant for heavy duty trucks. Devel- opment testing of this engine installed in an R-795S Model Mack chassis is presently in process. One of the major objectives of this program is the integration of the engine and the vehicle as a system, taking advantage of the unique characteristics of the turbine to optimize overall vehicle cost and performance without adversely affecting driveability by personnel trained to operate conventional diesel-powered trucks. 790772.

Aircraft fire fighting and rescue vehicle design is deter- mined by several critical factors necessary to rapidly accomplish the rescue of occupants of aircraft involved in accidents or threatening situations. These critical factors include time constraints, the area of response, the terrain to be traversed and the characteristics of the emergency. Vehicle performance requirements can be established by identifying and analyzing these elements. 1979 SA E Transactions 790777. Professional Schools of Engineering. Carl W. Hall, College of Engrg., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA. The future education of engineers must include a greater emphasis on professionalism, which has been recognized by many engineering colleges. The topics to be covered, and the extent of the coverage, for professional education are not well defined. A Professional School would involve people from the profession, consider the needs of society, inculcate high ethical practices, and provide continuing education. The technical and professional background would prepare engineers to be leaders in the application of technology. The adequacy of the technical education will be based on accreditation by ECPD. An approach to assure an adequate professional engineering education is through the development and recognition of Professional Schools of Engineering. Considerable discussion has taken place, and continues, on the recognition of such schools. A suggestion currently being pursued is that guidelines be used as a basis of evaluating schools or colleges which seek identification as professional schools or units. The paper presents the tentative guidelines developed by a task force of NSPE for recognizing Professional Schools. 790779. Fire Suppression Systems. James W. Jewett, John Deere Dubuque Works, Deere &amp; Co. "Off the Road" vehicle fire losses are increasing each year. Larger units and increasing usage of electronics and high pressure-high temperature hydraulics combined with accumulations of combustible material increase their vulnerability to fires. Fire suppression systems offered by Deere and most other major manufacturers, are now available for these types of vehicles and have proven their capabilities to reduce fire losses as shown in a recent study on skidder fires. 790780. A Self-Propelled Three Row Automatic Seedling Planter. John Walters, Univ. of British Columbia Research Forest (Canada). A new tree-seedling planting machine has been developed which is based on the technique of injection-planting of containerized seedlings.

A Running Skyline System for Harvesting Small Logs. Charles N. Mann, Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service. A prototype skyline yarder, mounted on a John Deere JD 640 cable skidder, has been developed for harvesting small logs from thinnings. The objective was to advance technology through the development of a low cost, high performance system to solve major economic and envi- ronmental problems in managing young forests. Logging tests indicate that this type of system can make a significant contribution for solving these problems. Sev- eral manufacturers are currently engaged in developing yarders based on this concept. 790782. The Need for Inspection and Maintenance for Current and Future Motor Vehicles. Thomas Cackette, Inspection/Maintenance Staff, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Philip Lorang and David Hughes, Technical Support Group, Inspection/Maintenance Staff, U.S. En- vironmental Protection Agency. The majority of automobiles on the road today exceed the emission standards to which they were designed. This failure to achieve the design emission levels is primarily attributed to improper maintenance, tampering with emission controls, and misfueling catalyst cars with leaded gasoline. A method of reducing improper maintenance, tampering, and misfueling is periodic emission inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. I/M's ability to deal with in-use emission problems is discussed and contrasted to the other mobile source emission control strategies. The results of EPA's evalu- ation of the Portland, Oregon, I/M program are pre- sented. This study shows I/M to be extremely effective in reducing emission levels. A question remains, however, as to whether I/M will be a necessary emission control strategy for the generation of electronically controlled, 3-way catalyst vehicles that will be introduced nationwide in 1981. Recent data on California models and several 1981 prototype vehicles utilizing these control systems show that failures of these new systems, or failure to replace the vehicle's oxygen sensor, can result in extremely high emission levels. The potential for the high emission levels to occur in-use is discussed, and preliminary data on the various short tests' ability to detect high emitting vehicles is presented. 790783.

Blass, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corporation; B. E. Zemke and T. W. Evernham, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Amendments to the Clean Air Act require the imple- mentation of inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs in areas designated as non-attainment and unable to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards by 1982. Current I/M programs have been developed using data representative of pre- and early-catalyst emission control technology. Changes to current emission control systems and electronic computer controlled systems represent new emission control technology. This paper addresses the I/M situation as related to these system changes. Results of tests on a prototype system are presented. Parameter inspection and the utilization of built-in diagnostics on future systems have the potential to maximize the effectiveness of I/M programs. 790784. The Oregon Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection Program. William P. Jasper, Jr. and Ron House- holder, Oregon Dept. of Environmental Quality. Motor vehicle emissions have been determined to con- stitute a public health hazard, especially in the U.S. metropolitan areas. Under amendments to the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Congress has directed that national ambient air health standards must be met by specified dates. All reasonable control measures including vehicular emission inspection programs should be implemented in those areas not able to meet minimum public health ambient air levels. This potentially affects metropolitan areas in 40 states. This paper describes the implementation of an emission inspection program in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, the effects of that program on the emissions from the area's motor vehicles, and the effect on ambient air quality. 1979 SA E Transactions 790785. A Comparison of Private Garage and Centralized I&amp;M Programs. Thomas C. Austin and Gary Rubenstein, California Air Resources Board. A fundamental decision to be made in developing a motor vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I&amp;M) program is whether a "centralized" or "private garage" program will be used. Under the centralized approach, the state or a state contractor operates a network of single purpose "Inspection Centers" to inspect motor vehicles before the completion of the annual registration renewal process. After any repairs necessary to correct vehicles with excessive emissions are made at a facility of the owner's choosing, the vehicle must pass a reinspection at the Inspection Center. Under the private garage (decentral- ized) approach, both inspections and repairs are con- ducted by private repair facilities licensed by the state. A comparison of a centralized I&amp;M program and a private garage I&amp;M program currently operating in California indicates that the centralized program is providing over ten times greater emissions reductions. The superior performance of the centralized program appears to be due in large part to the fact that emissions related defects are more efficiently and reliably identified with the use of highly automated Inspection Centers. The fact that vehicles with excessive emissions are independently reinspected to check the quality of the repairs performed also appears to be a factor contributing to the superior performance of centralized I&amp;M programs. An analysis of the potential for upgrading both programs indicates that the private garage approach is unlikely to ever be competitive with a centralized I&amp;M program. 790786.

The Use of a Thermogravimetric Analyser for the Investigation of Particulates and Hydrocarbons in Diesel Engine Exhaust. R. D. Cuthbertson, H. C. Stinton and R. W. Wheeler, Ricardo Con- sulting Engineers, Ltd., Bridge Works, Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex (England). The conditions necessary for obtaining samples of diesel particulates in CVS tunnels have been investigated in relation to the simultaneous analysis of the gaseous hydrocarbons which were present in equilibrium with the particulate borne hydrocarbons. Thermogravimetric analysis has been developed to separate the components of particulates in a simple way which is useful in diesel engine research. A reliable instrument has been interfaced with a heated flame ionization detector which gave additional or corroborative information. A system has been evolved for total diesel hydro- carbon analysis using thermogravimetry for those hydro- carbons trapped on the particulate filter, and heated flame ionization detection for those passing through the filter. The results are compared with total hydrocarbon analysis as used in the Federal Test Procedure and show a small gain in hydrocarbon recovery with an increase in overall information for the new system. 1979 SA E Transactions 790815. Analysis of the Physical Characteristics of Diesel Particulate Matter Using Transmission Electron Microscope Techniques. Kenneth Carpenter and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. An Andersen Impactor was used to collect particulate samples in both the undiluted and diluted exhaust from a Caterpillar 3150 diesel engine operated on the EPA 13-mode cycle. A total of 24 samples were examined using the transmission electron microscope and approximately 300 photomicrographs were taken. The microscope anal- ysis and photomicrographs revealed details concerning the physical characteristics of the particulate and permitted a direct visual comparison of the samples collected. The photomicrographs were used to obtain diameter measurements of the basic individual spherical particles that comprise the much larger aggregates/agglomerates. Nearly 11,000 basic particles were measured and the observed range of diameters was 70-1200 Â. The mean particle diameters in the undiluted and diluted exhaust samples were 479 À and 436 À respectively. These size measurements were grouped, by operating mode, to provide size distributions for the basic spherical particles. At the lower temperatures of the diluted exhaust, evidence of hydrocarbon condensation is illustrated in many of the photomicrographs. In some instances, the condensed coating is so heavy as to completely obscure all detail of the aggregate/agglomerate on which it is adsorbed and the differences between undiluted and diluted exhaust samples are quickly discerned. Several of the samples showed what appeared to be "droplets" or "pools of liquid". 1979 SA E Transactions 121</page><page sequence="105">790816-790822 790816. Unregulated Emissions Measurement Method- ology. Harry E. Dietzmann, Southwest Research Inst.; and Frank M. Black, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Analytical procedures for the measurement of unregulated emissions in automotive exhaust have been developed. Compounds in the emissions characterization inventory include organic sulfides, nickel carbonyl, aldehydes, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, organic amines, nitrous oxide, individual hydrocarbons, total cyanide, sulfate, phenol, particulate and others. Validation experiments were conducted with selected methods to develop a well-defined analytical procedure. Qualification of the procedure involved injection of known amounts of the individual species into a dilution tunnel - CVS system. These analytical procedures are currently being employed to characterize unregulated emissions from a variety of low NOx vehicles, advanced powerplants and vehicles operating under malfunction conditions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790817. Crane Load Indicators - The European Way. Derek G. Hutchins, Ekco Instruments Ltd., Southend-on-Sea, (Essex/England). European experience in the use of Load Indicators on mobile cranes is considerably in excess of that at present in the United States of America.

The paper covers the background and some present research in the Norwegian milieu related to thermal loading of large and medium speed diesel engines. Instrumentation employed in this research is presented, emphasis being placed on sensors for combustion and heat transfer. Use of minicomputers for data acquisition, processing and presentation is emphasized, together with their use for FEM calculation of temperature fields. Short surveys of current projects in process modelling, digitally controlled injection, plasma-sprayed thermal barriers, combustion of problem heavy fuels and in thermal loading of medium speed diesels are given, together with a number of typical references. 790820. (SP-449) Strength Analysis of Thermally Loaded Engine Components by T wo-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Finite Element Models. O. T. Saugerud and N. Sandsmark, Research Division, Det norské Veritas, Oslo, Norway, p.t. Division of Combustion Engines and Marine Engineer- ing, The University of Trondheim (NTH), Trondheim, Norway. Design analyses of thermally loaded engine components by simplified two-dimensional models rather than full three-dimensional ones can reduce costs by an order of magnitude or more. However, in some cases the signif- icance of the results is also reduced and even lost. The effects of such simplifications are discussed, using a diesel engine piston and a radial turbine wheel as examples. Temperature distributions can be computed with good accuracy using simplified models and engi- neering judgement. The results of stress analyses are much more uncertain and the use of simplified models requires careful considerations, as even widely used and accepted idealizations can produce results which are directly misleading. 790821. (SP-449) Prediction of Thermal Loading of Supercharged Diesel Engines. Gerhard Woschni, Lehrstuhl für Verbrennungskraftmaschinen und Kraftfahrzeuge, Technische Universität München. Experimental investigations were carried out on a high speed Diesel engine, where the heat fluxes to the different components piston, cylinder head, and liner were separately determined by evaluating heat balances and measured steady state temperature fields. A comparison with the results of cycle simulations carried out with the equation for the local mean heat transfer coefficient suggested by the author around 15 years ago shows, that this equation is applicable to predict the heat losses to the cylinder walls and their influence on the process data as well as the steady state temperature fields occurring in the components during operation. 790822. Advanced Generation Hand Levers. H. J. Andresen, Midwest First Co., Glenview, IL. This development relates to manually operated levers which can be actuated in either direction from center with common arm motion inputs and with hand squeeze inputs, either alone or in combination with each other at the operator's option. 122</page><page sequence="106">790823-790827 Where two input forms are combined into a single output, larger capacity valves are manually stroked with considerably reduced actuation forces and with firmer feathering control for all valve sizes. Where inputs are each directed to separate outputs the development provides a single hand, single axis dual function electro- proportional control with provisions for adding additional functions from one arm/hand member. 1979 SAE Transactions 790823. (SP-449) Effect of Partial Suppression of Heat Loss to Coolant on the High Output Diesel Engine Cycle. F. J. Wallace, R. J. B. Way and H. Vollmert, School of Engineering, University of Bath. The paper describes the results of a detailed cycle analysis applied to a high output 6 cylinder truck Diesel engine a) in conventional form b) with a uniformly distributed layer of Silicon Nitride giving approximately isothermal wall conditions c) with adiabatic wall conditions. For case (b) the benefits are largely limited to increased exhaust enthalpy, suggesting the desirability of turbocompounding. Case (c) gives marked improvement in cycle efficiency as well as raised exhaust enthalpy. Paper II deals with the implications of these findings with respect to turbocharged and turbocompound schemes. 790824. (SP-449) Results of Matching Calculations for Turbocharged and Compound Engines with Re- duced Heat Loss. R. J. B. Way and F. J. Wallace, School of Engineering, University of Bath, U.K. The paper describes the results of matching calculations showing the effect of reduced heat loss on the interaction between an engine and the turbomachinery components. The engine used is the Perkins 6.354 six cylinder engine with low compression ratio pistons. Results are shown over a speed range between 1000-2500 rev/min for both simple turbocharged and turbocharged compound engines in either standard form or with 50% heat suppression, the effect on engine only performance being based on the results of the detailed cycle analysis described in Paper I. The results show that compounding increases the efficiency by a significant margin, while the effect of heat suppression on engine efficiency alone is relatively small. 790825. (SP-449) Advanced Approaches for Heat Trans- fer Calculations. Günter F. Hohenberg, Research and Development, Daimler-Benz A.G. For the purpose of determining the heat transfer extensive experimental investigations have been carried out. Since the generally usual method of heat balance can not supply sufficiently detailed and appropriate results, three meas- urements procedures have been improved in such a way that the required degree of accuracy can be achieved: Surface temperature method heat flux probe application and combustion chamber pressure measurement. The results obtained from these experiments form the basis for an uncomplicated, yet precise method of heat transfer calculation. Comparisons between measured and calcu- lated heat flux show sufficient concurrence. 1979 SAE Transactions 790826. (SP-449) Heat Transfer in the Indirect Injection Diesel Engine. M. Kamel and N. Watson, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Impe- rial College of Science &amp; Technology, London, SW7 2BX, England. The paper presents a method for predicting instantaneous heat transfer between the working fluid of an indirect injection diesel engine and the combustion chamber surfaces in main and pre-chamber. The correlation proposed is for both motored and fired engine operation and is supported by experimental evidence. The model is based on the conventional Nusselt- Reynolds number relationship for the convective term, but using a novel approach for the local characteristic velocity term. Under fired conditions, velocity enhance- ment is included together with a radiation model. An experimental programme of instantaneous heat flux measurement in pre- and main chamber is described, under a wide range of engine operating conditions, both motored and fired. Comparisons of measured and pre- dicted heat fluxes, in both chambers, are given. Also included are mean values of main and pre-chamber surface temperature, and connecting passage wall tem- peratures. 790827. The Effect of Thickness, Strain Level &amp; Strain Rate on the NDT Temperature of Low Carbon Steels. J. A. Begley and A. Valkonen, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; and D. R. Galliart, Deere &amp; Company, Moline, Illinois. Two candidate ROPS steels and a common grade of low carbon steel were used to study the effects of thickness, strain rate and strain level on the nil-ductility transition temperature (NDTT). The NDTT was determined by using a modification of ASTM Standard Test Method E208. Comparison tests were made with Charpy V-notch specimens. No general correlation was found between the thick- ness modified NDT temperatures and the Charpy energy absorption of specimens of similar thickness. However, a good correlation was observed between the NDT tem- perature and the 100 percent brittle fracture appearance temperature of the Charpy specimens. A thickness modified NDTT test provides a reason- able simulation of the critical regions of ROPS structures during a rollover. Brittle fracture of ROPS structures is not desirable above the minimum ambient operating temperature where the vehicle is used. Hence the thickness modified NDTT test may provide additional information for material selection and the specification of recom- 123</page><page sequence="107">790828-790834 mended operating temperatures. Low carbon steels are commonly used in the manu- facture of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS). These steels exhibit a dramatic transition from high to low toughness as temperature is lowered. The temperature at which this transition occurs is highly dependent on the strain rate as well as on the material thickness of the particular structure. These factors can be considered in the performance of ROPS for machines exposed to low ambient temperatures. A simple materials evaluation test that reflects cold temperature suitability is needed for the selection and for specifications of acceptance and manufacturing quality control of ROPS materials. 790828. Toughness Considerations of Structural Steel for Roll Over Protective Structures. T. M. Clarke and G. H. Walter, International Harvester Company. Certain roll over protective structures, ROPS, require resistance to the propagation of brittle fractures at low temperatures. It is demonstrated that the Charpy test is not suitable for characterizing crack propagation resis- tance. A drop weight test of thin wall tubular specimens was developed which uses a brittle crack starter weld. This test provides an indication of the temperature transition from low to high crack propagation resistance. Because of toughened heat affected zones which can occur in cold formed steel this test is reliable only for hot formed tubes. The temperature transition to high propagation resistance can be determined with precracked Charpy and Dynamic Tear Energy, DT, specimens applicable to cold or hot formed steel. A weld joint simulation specimen was developed to determine energy absorption capacity and low temper- ature fracture behavior of ROPS joint designs and material. 790829. Quantifying the Brittle Fracture Resistance of ROPS and FOPS Steels. B. N. Babu, Caterpillar Tractor Co., Peoria, IL. Several heats of ASTM A36 and A572 Grade 42 steels were tested for brittle fracture resistance using Charpy V-notch (CVN), dynamic tear, static and dynamic fracture toughness tests. Sheet steels were characterized by subsize Charpy and double edge notch specimen testing. The effects of strain rate, temperature, section size and notch geometry on toughness were explored. Dynamic fracture toughness (KId) tests were conducted on full thickness (12 mm) specimens at strain rates close to those felt by the ROPS in a typical roll over of a large machine, and a CVN-K correlation given by KId = 26(CVN)0 43 was derived. 790830. A Unitized Piston Design for Hydraulic Cylinder Applications. Terry Rudd, Dynamic Seals, Inc. A new unitized piston design provides important oppor- tunities for progress in mobile equipment hydraulic cylinder applications. Improved bearing and sealing characteristics and tighter dimensional tolerances permit shorter cylinders and permit higher working hydraulic pressures, which in turn permit use of smaller, lighter, more energy efficient hydraulic equipment. In production, a steel body has nylon bearing material injection molded onto the OD. A groove machined in the periphery retains a rubber loader ring and a teflon piston seal ring. Tests demonstrate negligible piston seal ring wear, volumetric efficiency better than 99.998 percent (dynam- ic), and drift less than 0.0015 in. (0.0381 mm) per hour (static). 790833. (SP-449) Experimental Investigation of the In- stantaneous Heat Transfer in the Cylinder of a High Speed Diesel Engine. K. Sihling, Daimler- Benz AG; and G. Woschni, Lehrstuhl für V erbrennungskraf tmaschinen und Kraftfahr- zeuge der Technischen Universität München. Measurements of instantaneous surface temperature variations have been made at five positions of the combustion chamber side of the cylinder head of a modern four-valve, high speed Diesel engine with external supercharging. By means of analysing the measured data and calculating the engine cycle local and local-average instantaneous heat transfer coefficients have been derived. It became evident that the steady-state component of the total heat flux into the solid wall normal to the surface can only be determined inexactly by measurements, because of none-one-dimensional temperature distribution in the wall, whereas the fluctuating component can be calculated exactly enough from the measured surface temperature variation. Finally the measured local and local-mean instantaneous heat transfer coefficients are compared with the results of Woschni's formula for the local-average heat transfer coefficient. The agreement is very good as far as the variation with time and the integral of the high pressure phase of the cycle are concerned. 790834. (SP-449) Determination of Local Heat Transfer Coefficients at the Piston of a High Speed Diesel Engine by Evaluation of Measured Temperature Distribution. Gerhard Woschni and Johann Fieger, Lehrstuhl für Verbrennungskraft- maschinen und Kraftfahrzeuge, Technische Universität München. For different operating conditions of a high spe'ed Diesel engine the steady state temperature fields in the piston were measured and evaluated by use of the relaxation method and the electrolytic tank analogue. Thus the local heat transfer coefficients at the contour of the piston could be determined. To obtain in spite of the weakness of the method, that 20 measured temperatures are not 124</page><page sequence="108">790837-790843 sufficient to define exactly the temperature field, reliable results, different test series were carried out with extremely altered cooling conditions at the piston. More than 60 temperature fields were evaluated thus deter- mining the heat transfer coefficients at the piston crown, the bottom side, the cooling channel and at the piston rings. 1979 SA E Transactions 790837. Energy Requirements for Alternative Rice Pro- duction Systems in the Tropics. Donald O. Kuether and Bart Duff, Int. Rice Research Inst. (Los Banos/Philippines). The energy requirements of three alternative rice pro- duction systems used by most small Asian farmers are identified by task and source of energy so energy levels and components of each system can be compared. Human energy contributes a small portion of total energy input into most traditional Asian rice farming systems. As food production systems modernize, they become less energy efficient and more dependent on commercial energy. 790838. The Center Pivot - The First Irrigation Machine. W. E. Splinter, Dept. of Agricultural Engrg., The Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE. The commercial development of the center pivot irrigation machine has brought the technology of machine design into an area formerly dominated by hydraulics and hydrology. The major attributes of these systems - ac- commodations to sandy soils and rolling terrain, effi- ciency in application of water, automation and flexibility in operation - are countered by depletion of the aquifer on a long-term basis and high energy consumption. The key to continued short-term expansion of center pivot irrigation will be the cost of energy relative to the market value of crops raised under the system. 790840. A Study on Gasoline Engine Combustion by Observation of Intermediate Reactive Products during Combustion. Masaaki Noguchi and Yukiyasu Tanaka, Toyota Motor Co. Ltd.; Taro Tanaka and Yukihisa Takeuchi, Nippon Soken Inc. In the case of two-stroke cycle gasoline engines, it is a rather well known fact that under light-load operation they do not run smoothly, but have a high concentration of unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust gas, as well as a high fuel consumption rate. In the study to improve such unstable conditions by devising a scavenging process of the engine, we often encountered self-ignited combustion, a kind of "RUN- ON". This combustion was found to be very stable and fine with low emissions of HC, and improved fuel consumption. A study was carried out on this self-ignited combus- tion by optical analysis. Many differences were observed between self-ignited combustion and conventional spark ignited combustion on the behavior of formation of chemical intermediate products before and after ignition. Self-ignited combustion has been found to occur under relatively low cylinder pressure and temperature, compared to diesel engine combustion, presumably by virtue of intermediate products. This special self-ignited combustion is named "TS (Toyota-Soken) combustion". 1979 SA E Transactions 790841. Abnormal Combustion of Two Stroke Cycle Gasoline Snowmobile Engine at High Speed and Full Load. Tetsuzo Fujikawa and Shinji Abe, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. Abnormal combustion, which is a cause for engine failure, is explicated to be high speed knocking by multicycle analysis of the cylinder pressure data of snowmobile two stroke cycle engines operated at high speed and wide open throttle condition. A mini-computer was used for the analysis of the cylinder pressure data. Calculation of the entire cycle was conducted until an engine actually failed and the rela- tionship between the engine failure and the conditions surrounding the knocking was made clear. Using the rate of pressure change as a quantitative evaluation method for high speed knocking, a combustion chamber shape with less knocking occurrence possibility was selected. 790842. Predicting the Performance Characteristics of Two-Cycle Engines Fitted with Reed Induction Valves. G. P. Blair and E. T. Hinds, The Queen's Univ. of Belfast (Northern Ireland); and R. Fleck, Mercury Marine, Oshkosh, WI. Earlier papers by the principal author in conjunction with others have described the prediction of noise and performance characteristics of two-cycle spark-ignition crankcase compression engines. These calculations are performed on a digital computer and are shown to simulate accurately the unsteady gas flow and thermo- dynamic processes in such power units. The engines described previously had induction control by the piston or with a disc valve. In this paper the work is extended to engines fitted with reed valves controlling intake air flow and examples illustrating the effectiveness of such cal- culations are presented. In particular, a single-cylinder industrial engine is employed to show clearly the effects of changing such parameters as reed petal thickness, stop- plate radii and numbers of reed petals on the performance characteristics. The mathematical model is extended also to a twin-cylinder outboard marine engine and compar- isons of measured and predicted performance behaviour are presented. 1979 SA E Transactions 790843. Experiences with Nickel-Silicon-Carbide Coat- ings in Cylinder Bores of Small Aluminum Engines. Albrecht E. Ostermann, Mahle GmbH 125</page><page sequence="109">790844-790850 (Stuttgart/West Germany). Besides the chrome plated cylinder the cylinder with the electroplated dispersion coating consisting of nickel with the embedded hard silicon-carbide particles is the most important cylinder type for small aluminum engines. This paper deals mainly with the nickel-silicon-carbide-cyl- inder. The properties of this composite metallic coating and results from engine tests in comparison to hard chrome and hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloy are described. 790844. The AVI Seríes III Diesel- A Differentially- Cooled Semi-Adiabatic Engine Below 10 kW. C. S. Kirloskar, S. B. Chandorkar and N. N. Narayan Rao, Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd. (Pune/India). A new type of internal combustion engine has been built which is characterised by reduced cooling of the com- bustion chamber achieved by using a water-cooled head with a cast iron piston and a liner cooled only by conduction and convection. This paper provides a de- scription of the engine and some experimental results, followed by a discussion of its design and performance features. The outstanding characteristic of the small hp engine is its very low specific fuel and lubricating oil consumption combined with high reliability. 790845. Modern Connecting Rod Bearings and Multi- Piece Crankshafts for Two-Cycle Engines. Karl A. Luebbersmeyer, INA Bearing Co., Inc., Cornwells Heights, PA. The trend toward higher power to weight ratios, higher fuel to oil ratios, less noise, and better fuel economy, significantly affects the configuration of the crankshaft, connecting rod, and antifriction bearings in the modern two-cycle engine. The multi-piece crankshaft together with the one-piece connecting rod, the one-piece crankpin and wristpin cage bearing have been widely introduced in Europe. This concept permits higher speeds through less friction and promises to fulfill the requirements imposed on future two-cycle engines. Balanced component design, suitable size and form tolerances are essential factors for success. 790847. Rational Design of Mobile Hydraulics by Digital Computer. Gian Luca Zarotti, CEMOTER, Earthmoving Research Center (Torino/Italy); and Nicola Nervegna, Istituto di Macchine, Politecnico di Torino. In view of a rational appraisal of mobile hydraulics design, a simple yet significant example system is considered and a detailed static analysis is performed by means of a conversational computer program, basically modular in concept, and flexible enough to allow the implementation of potentially feasible refinements and extensions. A representative and meaningful number of applications is detailed within the major topics of energy transmission and system control characteristics. The paper delineates the development of the mathematical model and presents results of the analysis by adopting two intrinsically different methods of attack: the parametric search and the stochastic approach. Relative merits of these methods are contrasted in the light of their informative yield capabilities and adequacy in accurately reflecting system performances. Output data are then scrutinized and proper inferences are made. 1979 SA E Transactions 790848. Agricultural Tractor Electro-Hydraulics. P. Lourigan, J I Case Co; and K. Patel, Dynex/ Rivett, Inc. Advancements in farming techniques have required improvements be sought in the vehicle hydraulic system control. The application of a Electro-Hydraulic Servo System has produced these improvements for the J I Case Company on one series of its Agricultural tractors. This paper describes the control features, the inter- facing of controls to the tractor and the requirement for system reliability. 1979 SA E Transactions 790849. A High Power Density Traction Drive. Yves Kemper, Vade tec Corp. A new traction drive has been developed which has the power density required for use in both on- and off- highway vehicles. It avoids problems faced by other types of traction drives such as high contact stresses and roller positioning. The range extends from 0 to 1:1. Cost and efficiency are competitive with other automatic and manual transmissions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790850. State of the Art of Spherical Roller Bearings. Walter P. Wieland and Wolf Poesl, FAG Bearings Corp., Stamford, CT. The historical evolution of the spherical roller bearings is discussed briefly. The different internal and external designs common in today's market are evaluated regard- ing their load carrying ability, roller guidance, and friction. It can be shown that all these criteria have to be evaluated simultaneously with a view towards the appli- cation conditions expressed by the load magnitude, load angle, load direction changes, speed, speed changes and mounting conditions. It can also be shown that the method of guiding the rollers by means of a retainer or by means of an integral center flange are equally valid and equally efficient methods under most application con- ditions. In cases of extreme application conditions, however, it is evident that the positive guidance of the rolling elements through an integral centerflange will result in lower friction, i.e. better running conditions. It is also shown that other design factors besides the retainer and center flange are available such as the splitting of the 126</page><page sequence="110">790851-790856 bearing rings in axial and circumferential direction, to modify a bearing for special application conditions. 1979 SA E Transactions . 790851. The Use of the Scanning Electron Microscope in Analyzing Rolling Contact Surfaces. W. J. Derner, Bearing. Div., FMC Corp. Practical uses of the scanning electron microscope in commercial laboratories permits a more practical ap- proach to failure analysis which results in improved pictorial evaluation. Reflected radiation depended upon in optical systems often obscures the true nature of the surface. The scanning electron microscope assures defi- nition and details previously unavailable. Differentiation between changes in surface due to abrasive wear is readily discerned and separated from the changes due to welding, galling, scoring or similar actions associated with break- down of the lubricant film. A number of significant failure modes are shown. Discussion is offered of details which are of value to the journeyman. 1979 SA E Transactions 790852. Forest Oriented Mechanization. Eric A. Bourdo, Jr., School of Forestry and Wood Products, Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI. The need for small, versatile, relatively low cost forest oriented timber harvesting equipment is a natural out- growth of forest management as expressed through logging. Logging initially was dominated by horse energy, then by the adaptation of construction machinery to woods use, and now by woods equipment of special design. More compact forest oriented equipment utilizing successfully demonstrated principles has the potential for greatly intensifying forest management on small owner- ships which constitute the bulk of America's commercial forest acres. Incentive is provided not only by present and future demands on wood for construction, furnishings, and fiber, but also as a renewable source of energy. 790853. Wood Energy - Viable Alternative. Jerry M. Morey, Morbark Industries, Inc. Norval Morey, President of Morbark Industries in Winn, Michigan has pioneered the concept of using the waste wood in our forests for energy. This concept calls for the removal from our forests of the dead, dying, diseased and overmature trees, as well as the undesirable species. This wood can be used to supply energy, while at the same time improve the stand and provide a better stock of trees to meet our more traditional needs, such as paper and lumber. From the studies that have been completed thus far, Mr. Morey has determined there is enough wood presently going to waste in our forests to more than offset present U.S. oil imports. The conversion to wood energy has already begun. Wood-fired systems are now commonplace in the forest products industry. Outside that industry a brick plant, a textile mill, a public electrical generating facility, a distillery, schools and other public facilities have already converted to wood as their major source of energy. 790854. Computing the Fatigue Strength and Field Life of Shovel Loader Axle Shafts Using Finite Ele- ments. N. Slack, Ford Tractor Operations. Design analysis of earth moving equipment has been used extensively in recent years. This increased utilization has focused on finite element analysis methods. This paper presents a method for accumulating, analysing, and interpreting data for effectively meeting design strength analysis needs. This method is used in an example involving a shovel loader axle, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. It indicates how field recorded data is processed by the "rainflow" accumulation method and compared to the strength of the component to determine the calculated field fatigue life. Internal stresses at weld interfaces and the stress concentration at notches are presented. 790855. Measurement of Piston Frictional Force in Actual Operating Diesel Engine. Shoichi Furuhama and Masaaki Takiguchi, Musashi Institute of Tech- nology (Tokyo/ Japan). Frictional force as a function of crank angle of a piston assembly and piston rings alone were measured after the following devices were developed. (1) A gas sealing device that did not affect the measuring values. (2) A device to minimize the effect of gas pressure on the cylinder head and block deformations. (3) A device to minimize the effect of piston slap force. From the measurement of the frictional force dia- grams the following characteristics have been found. (1) Lubricating oil temperature has the greatest effect upon the frictional loss of the piston. (2) Piston friction does not increase to the point of becoming proportional to the engine speed. (3) Friction in the expansion stroke increases at high load by the piston slap phenomenon. But the increase of total losses are small because the duration is short. (4) Piston rings account for the majority of the entire frictional force of the piston. 1979 SA E Transactions 790856. Finite Element Based Life Predictions for Prod- uct Evaluation. Lee E. Tucker and Richard C. Coddington, John Deere Dubuque Wks.; and James E. Crosheck, Deere &amp; Co., Technical Center. A systems approach was used to reduce development time for product evaluation. The approach combines field measured load-time data with finite element modeling and strain-life prediction techniques. This allows the design engineer to estimate component life of design alternatives prior to construction and testing. The approach is illustrated with examples from the design evaluation of a motor grader main frame. 127</page><page sequence="111">790857-790864 790857. (SP-449) Design and Fatigue Life Evaluation of Pistons for High BMEP Diesel Engines. W. Sander and S. Schoeckle, Karl Schmidt GmbH, Germany. To meet the fatigue life requirements under high specific engine loading two piston design approaches are dis- cussed. Due to advanced fatigue design and technology including internal piston cooling the aluminum piston is an optimum solution in a mep range of 12 to 17 bar. For higher rating a nodular cast iron piston design - also using internal cooling - is presented in detail. Engines with cast iron monobloc pistons are running nowadays at mean effective pressures of 16 to 22.3 bar. An upper limit of this piston design has not been reached. Based on finite element analyses fatigue life predictions are included for two examples. 790858. (SP-449) Some Diesel Piston Features in Design Analysis and Experiment. Robert Munro, Wellworthy Limited. A general view of current high speed diesel piston technology is presented by selective consideration of new design features, analytical methods and research and development programmes. Attention is directed to the wider use of computer-assisted predictive techniques and several recently developed programs are summarised. The subjects of oil cooling, crown cracking, close clearance designs and land/groove features, important in today's development scene, are considered in some detail with reference to predictive methods and new experimental programmes. 1979 SA E Transactions 790859. (SP-449) Investigations of Engine Components by Means of Photoelasticity. Manfred D. Roehrle, MAHLE GmbH, Germany. Use is made of computer programs and photoelasticity within the scope of pressure and thermal stress analysis when developing and testing components for internal combustion engines, e.g. pistons. Calculation, using finite elements, is described in a number of papers, but comparatively few publications today deal with the possibilities opened up by photo- elasticity. The aim of this paper is therefore to indicate the potential applications of photoelasticity in the stress and deformation analysis of engine components with reference to a few examples. In view of the fact that MAHLE GmbH makes extensive use of both engine-component calculation methods employing 2D and 3D finite element computer programs and the opportunities presented by photoelasticity in stress and deformation analysis, this paper is justified in presenting the photoelasticity method with all its merits and demerits and in comparing it with computer calculation using finite elements. 790860. Piston Ring Motion and Its Influence on Engine Tribology. Shoichi Furuhama and Masaru Hiruma, Musashi Inst, of Technology (Japan); and Makoto Tsuzita, Hino Motors Ltd. (Japan). Piston rings have significant influences on the engine performance and tribology. The effect of such rings has a delicate relation with the axial motion in the groove. By simultaneously measuring the ring motion and the gas pressure between the rings in actual operations of automobile gasoline engines and diesel ones, the authors could observe undesirable motions none has ever expected. The motions gave the engines serious problems. One was the occurrence of ring scuffing when, in a gasoline engine operation, the top and second ring lifted off simultaneously before combustion T.D.C. The other was, in a supercharged diesel engine, the time which the top ring contacts on the upper groove surface is long, which resulted in an asymmetric temperature distribution in the ring and possibility of a great oil consumption. 1979 SA E Transactions 790861. Interface Bond Study of Piston Ring Face Coatings. Douglas E. Essenmacher and William B. Young, Perfect Circle Div., Dana Corp. Some high output diesel engines require ring face coatings that can withstand mechanical and thermal stresses beyond the capabilities of chromium plate. Until such a time when superior coating systems are available, plasma arc coatings are being used to fill the gap. This paper discusses the results of tests aimed at reducing the incidence of bond break-down at the interface of plasma sprayed coatings applied to the piston ring face. 790863. Analysis of Piston Ring Packs for Combustion Engines. Friedhelm Stecher, Goetze AG. On close inspection, piston rings which have been run display minimum wear, from which one can derive information concerning ring movement in the groove. The wear induced side shape of rings and piston grooves characteristic of a large number of engines of different construction. The movement of rings in their grooves changes in turn as a result of the changed side shapes. This has a significant influence on performance, oil consumption and blow-by, as well as on bearing surface wear. The sealing behavior of a compression ring under static gas pressure and simulated inertial load can be studied in a simple test apparatus. By comparing ring sealing behavior determined in this way with blow-by curves measured in a running engine, further information is obtained about side contact and movement characteristics of the piston ring in its groove. The relationship established permits the analysis of ring behavior in the engine and of wear-induced changes, thus providing the basis for optimization research. 790864. A Survey of the Mechanical Design Factors Affecting Engine Oil Consumption. J. A. McGeehan, Chevron Research Co., Richmond,' 128</page><page sequence="112">790865-790871 CA. This paper reviews the mechanical factors affecting oil consumption in four-cycle diesel and gasoline engines and the practical solutions achieved by design modifications. There is an abundance of information on specific aspects of oil consumption, and this paper attempts to combine them in a single comprehensive review. It is based on a synthesis of technical papers, augmented by discussion with engine manufacturers. The pertinent information is organized into six discrete chapters: (1) Piston Rings, (2) Piston Design, (3) Cylinder Bores, (4) Valve Guide Seals, (5) Crankshaft Seals, and (6) Material Selection for Seals and Gaskets. 1979 SAE Transactions 790865. Piston Ring Coatings for Internal Combustion Engines. G. F. Hyde, J. E. Cromwell and J. H. Barnes, Koppers Co., Inc., Piston Ring and Seal Div., Baltimore, MD. Since the inception of the first internal combustion engine, the designers of engines and engine components have sought to improve piston ring wear resistance and to minimize cylinder liner wear. This paper describes and summarizes the work which has been done in our research laboratory towards this objective over a fifteen year period. The work encompasses aspects of coating design and metallurgical considerations, bench test data, labo- ratory engine test results and field engine results. Com- parisons showing engine and laboratory test results of piston rings coated with hard chromium plate, molyb- denum, compositions containing molybdenum and metal- lic oxides are presented. 790866. (SP-447) Investigation of Overall Efficiency in the First Few Hours of a Pump's Life. Thomas S. Wanke, Fluid Power Institute, Milwaukee School of Engineering. The Fluid Power Institute of the Milwaukee School of Engineering under contract from the US Army MERADCOM (Mobile Equipment Research and Devel- opment Command) has tested eighteen external spur gear pumps supplied by three different manufacturers to evaluate the changes in overall efficiency in the first few hours of the pump's life. The pumps were subjected to a common break-in procedure except that the contamina- tion level of the oil in six of the 18 test pumps was changed significantly to determine the effects on overall efficiency. The paper discusses the break-in procedure, contamina- tion levels and results of the test program. 1979 SA E Transactions 790867.

Various test methods are de- scribed and compared with respect to relative accuracy and cost. A means of rating components or subsystems with respect to their effect on the cleanliness of an entire hydraulic system is presented. This rating system permits evaluation of suppliers as well as components. The results of these tests have been used to initiate efficient, cost effective programs to improve component cleanliness. 790868. (SP-447) An Agriculture Equipment Manufac- turer's Approach to Assure a Clean Hydraulic System. Ray Edlund, International Harvester. Providing an agricultural tractor with clean hydraulic fluid presented a challenge which required a teamwork approach by manufacturing, design engineering and field service personnel to solve. The methods and procedures developed to assure compliance to cleanliness specifi- cations is offered as an approach that was used by one manufacturer. 1979 SA E Transactions 790869. (SP-447) Status Report on SAE Recommended Practice J1227 - " Assessing Cleanliness of Hy- draulic Fluid Power Components and Systems". John A. Farris, Pall Industrial Hydraulics Corp. The paper deals with the development of an SAE Recommended Practice. It includes the identification of the problem, the formation of the Task Group and the definition of the purpose. It proceeds into the structure of and summarizes the document, and gives an example of one of the important considerations: Reynolds number. In this example, the author illustrates the problem of room temperature flushing, and points out that effective flushing should be done at a Reynolds number which is turbulent and which exceeds the maximum Reynolds number that the system will experience under actual field conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ballot results and a request for feedback of significant findings. 1979 SAE Transactions 790870. (SP-447) Particle Counter Physics. Peter Mardosa, Dayton T. Brown, Inc. The use of liquid automatic particle counters has blossomed in the fluid power industry. As with any data producing instrument, proper calibration and operation within the physical limits of the system are necessary to produce meaningful data. This paper will address some of the basic physical concepts behind the operation of the most common types of liquid automatic particle counters. 1979 SAE Transactions 790871. (SP-447) The Significance and Preparation of Classified Test Contaminants. James N. Gehrking, Robert M. Nicholson and Robin E. 129</page><page sequence="113">790872-790879 Schaller, Donaldson Co., Inc. The tolerance of hydraulic system components to contam- inants can be evaluated by using standard Classified Test Contaminants (CTC). To perform this evaluation, particle size distributions with a top-size classification most accurately simulate hydraulic system contamination. A standard must be established for classified test contam- inants to insure that the hydraulic industry is supplied with suitable test materials. 1979 SAE Transactions 790872. (SP-447) Multiple Location Radioactive Wear Analysis Techniques. Gordon W. Jones, Fram Corp., Providence, RI. A proven radioactive wear measurement technique is proposed as a method for measuring wear in hydraulic components. This technique utilizes small irradiated areas of wearing surfaces, permitting the measurement of the wear of each surface from a point external to the component. The technique has been used successfully in the measurement of wear in several applications including internal engine component wear. The proposed areas for investigating the application of this technique are the metallic wearing areas of hydraulic system components, i.e., pumps, motors, valves, cylinders, etc. This method could provide a direct relationship between surface wear and performance degradation of the component. 1979 SA E Transactions 790873. (SP-447) Ferrographic Analysis for Hydraulic Fluids. Daniel P. Anderson, Foxboro Analytical, Burlington, MA. The principles and development of ferrography, a method of particle analysis for fluids, especially wear particle analysis for oil-wetted machine components, will be explained. First, a brief review of the particles of wear, a knowledge of which allows prediction of incipient failure, will be presented, then a model (1) to explain why wear particle concentration reaches equilibrium in the oil of any machine. Recently, ferrogram preparation materials have become available which allow deposition of non- magnetic organic particles for subsequent analysis which will also be discussed. 1979 SAE Transactions 790874. Shear Felling Head for the JD743 Tree Har- vester. Andrew P. Redman, John Deere Dubuque Wks., Dubuque, IA. A new shear felling head concept was specified as part of the proposal for the John Deere designed and manu- factured JD743 Tree Harvester. Specifications for the new shear felling head included cutting 460 mm diameter conifers, minimizing stem damage, cutting at ground level and eliminating snow plugging. Insight to the utilization of data from many research projects on shearing wood, evolution of new design concepts for shearing wood, and results from test programs which verify the felling head's capability to shear wood are covered in this paper. 790875. Design and Development of the Shear Blade for the JD743 Tree Harvester. Andrew P. Redman, Lee E. Tucker and Fred E. Rutan, John Deere Dubuque Wks., Dubuque, IA. This paper describes the methods and logic used to develop the tree shear blades on the JD743 Tree Harvester. Major emphasis is given to the techniques used to develop a simple, representative load cycle and how that load cycle was utilized with several evaluation methods. The coordinated use of numerical analysis and experimental measurement techniques is discussed as it was applied to reduce the time and expense required to develop the shear blade. 790877. Design of Increased Horsepower Agricultural P.T.O. Drivelines. T. S. Trojanowski, Hayes- Dana Inc. (Ontario/Canada). The population of larger than 150 horsepower tractors in North America has now grown to a point where powered implements are being designed to utilize the higher horsepower available. The continuing objective of reducing driveline noise levels while transmitting power efficiently can be achieved in these larger units by a proper analysis of the driveline geometry as well as the drive shaft design. This paper outlines the factors considered in the analysis. 790878. Interpretation of Laboratory Tests on Universal Joints. Teddy B. Johnson, Borg Warner Corp. The Cardan universal joint is widely used in highway and off-highway vehicles to transmit power for propulsion and accessories. In spite of its wide use, the analysis of driveline failures is complex because the failure modes are inter-related and the time required for wear failures to develop allows much evidence of the primary failure mode to be obscured. This paper presents a description of the basic failure modes that are common to Cardan universal joints and the relation between these failure modes and the labo- ratory tests that are used to investigate their effect on service life. Methods of analyzing the data generated in laboratory tests are also discussed. Finally, a compre- hensive example is presented to show the accumulation of information that can be obtained from a complete test program. 1979 SAE Transactions 790879. "Concept to Concrete" Development of a Truck Type Street Sweeper. Donald L. Hildebrand, Elgin Sweeper Co.; and John W. Wiss, Ohio Transportation, Testing Corp. A new truck type street sweeper has been developed which incorporates some of the sweeping advantages of a three 130</page><page sequence="114">790880-790888 wheeled sweeper (tricycle steer) and the transport advan- tages of a legal highway truck. It offers major productivity improvements through better operator environment and decrease of nonsweeping time in the operational cycle. It is possible for a small "short line" special purpose vehicle manufacturer to develop, test, and produce such a vehicle and meet Federal regulatory requirements with limited "In house" design and testing facilities. Here this was accomplished through judicious augmentation by outside specialized design and testing organizations. 790880. Improved Automatic Fire Protection Systems for Off-Highway Mine Vehicles. William H. Pomroy, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. Fire on off-road mine equipment is a serious hazard to life and property. The Bureau of Mines, through a program of contract and in-house research, has developed and demonstrated reasonably priced, reliable automatic fire protection systems to deal with this problem. This paper describes the development and subsequent in-mine tests of typical systems for front-end loaders, dozers, drills, haulage trucks, and hydraulic excavators. A variety of fire sensors, extinguishing agents, and control systems are discussed in the context of mine equipment designs and operating environments. 790882. Improved Fire Protection for Off-Highway Equip- ment. Thomas L. de Lime, III, Kidde Belleville, Div. of Walter Kidde Co., Inc. There is an increasing use of fire protection systems for off-the-road vehicles and equipment. Experience has shown need of improvements in both detection/control and suppression methods. Field problems and second generation solutions are discussed. 790883. An Interesting and Informative Comparison of Mobile Hydrostatic Wheel Hub Drives. Mike Clifford, ASEA, Inc., Houston, TX. The design engineer who is selecting components for the power transmission system of an off-the-road vehicle is always faced with the task of trying to select the best components for use in his particular design. This paper deals with the different torque transmission capabilities of various hydrostatic hydraulic wheel hub concepts com- pared on as nearly an equal basis as possible. 1979 SA E Transactions 790884. Expanding the Versatility of the Powershift Transmission by Incorporating Electrohydraulic Control Systems. William R. Jones and Robert W. Harris, Funk Manufacturing Co., Div. of Cooper Industries, Inc. In many powershift transmission applications such as cranes, excavators, articulated vehicles, vehicles with multiple transmissions, and vehicles with remote mounted transmissions, mechanical linkage systems normally used to operate the control valve become impractical and/or expensive. After evaluating these various applications it was determined that an electrohydraulic control system has a multitude of advantages over its mechanical counterpart. With these objectives in mind Funk Manufacturing has designed and developed a series of electrohydraulic control systems which function in concert with the Funk Shift-O-Matic transmissions. The control valve and some of the control systems are briefly described in this paper. 790885. How to Select the Right Hydrostatic Transmis- sion Circuit for Hydraulically Powered Vehicles. Mike Clifford, ASEA, Inc., Houston, TX. When designing a multi-wheel drive off-the-road vehicle, utilizing a hydrostatic hydraulic power transmission system, the design engineer is confronted with the problem of how to arrange the hydraulic circuit to provide steering flexibility, good all wheel tractive effort, rough terrain capability, etc. This paper outlines some of the basic techniques that can be used in designing a vehicle hydrostatic power transmission circuit. 790886. The Role of Additives in the Scuffing of Diesel Engine Piston Rings. M. J. Bailey, T. J. Crooks, P. T. Jeffs and A. Cameron, Lubrication Lab., Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Imperial College (London/England). A 3/16" hole drilled at bottom dead center of a small diesel engine allowed the rings to be observed optically and their surface temperature measured by infra red microdetector. Operating severity was increased by raising i) speed, ii) b.m.e.p., iii) linear temperature. Additives, oil viscosity and prolonged running were studied. It was found scuffing was far more prevalent and ring surface temperature far higher than expected. It seems the engine used scuffing as a means of running-in. 790887. The Evolution of Engine Oil Specifications from G to K. W. R. Alexander and L. T. Murphy, Mack Trucks, Inc. To establish a criteria for engine oil requirements for Mack diesel engines, a program was conducted to establish a specification based on the use of a production multicylinder engine. Laboratory engine tests were supple- mented by field tests to assure correlation. Subsequently modifications were made to the engine test procedures to accommodate modifications in engines being marketed. Oil monitoring and oil analysis programs were also implemented to further assist in assuring adequate engine lubrication. 790888. Ford TW-30 Tractor with Air-To-Air Intercooled Engine. C. E. McKeon, Agricultural and Com- ponent Engineering, Ford Tractor Operations, Ford Motor Company; and R. E. Turney, 131</page><page sequence="115">790889-790894 Production Evaluation &amp; Test Department, Ford Tractor Operations, Ford Motor Com- pany. Major design features incorporated in the new Ford TW-30 (163 HP) tractor are described. Emphasis is on the air-to-air (ATA) intercooled 401 CID (6.57 L) engine, transmission and rear axle features for the increased power, and other design changes necessary to attain the objectives set for reliability, serviceability, and perform- ance. Nebraska test results, which are reported in the summary, confirm achievement of the program objectives. Durability of the new tractor was evaluated by selective overload testing, using well established service and engineering test data as a base from which to judge the effectiveness of design changes. 790889. (SP-448) Some Considerations in Using Strain- Life Approach in Fatigue Design. T. V. Seshadri and Phil R. Pierce, R&amp;D Div., Fruehauf Corp. The use of the strain-life technique in designing for finite fatigue life is discussed. The difference in mathematical form of the cyclic stress-strain curve and hysteresis loops is explained. Examples are given to illustrate that stronger materials are not necessarily better for fatigue resistance. The importance of the knowledge of actual operating conditions of components and structures in designing for finite life is emphasized. Conditions under which the strain-life and Kf-As methods yield the same results are derived. A list of materials which satisfy these conditions is included. 790890. (SP-448) A Unified Predictive Technique for the Fatigue Resistance of Cast Ferrous-Based Metals and High Hardness Wrought Steels. M. R. Mitchell, Rockwell Intl. Science Center, Thou- sand Oaks, CA. A technique which treats the free graphite in gray and nodular cast iron, gas pores and microshrinkage cavities in cast steels and inclusions in wrought, high hardness steels as notches in a steel matrix results in quantitative predictions of the fatigue resistance of these ferous-based systems. 1979 SA E Transactions 790891. The Improvement of Fuel Injection System for Vehicle Diesel Engine Developing High Injection Rate. Shoichi Suzuki, Diesel kiki Co., Ltd. (Tokyo/ Japan). Development of a high injection rate as a means of meeting emissions and exhaust smoke control standards has posed various problems in fuel injection pumps. This paper describes the investigation into these problems in the two relative fields of high load and high speed area as well as low load and low speed area. In conjunction with high load and high speed, the paper describes experi- mental examples and the mechanism of fuel delivery control characteristics, design examples of the pump cam profile, cavitation erosion of the injection pipe and the improvement in the reliability of governer parts. Problems and countermeasures relative to instability of engine revolution caused by the injection system will be reported in connection with low load and low speed area. 790892. (SP-448) Bearing Life Expenditure During Run- ning-In. G. Massouros and A. Dimarogonas, School of Engrg., Univ. of Patras (Patras/ Greece). Experimental results are presented showing that total bearing wear during running-in, as well as running-in distance depend on the initial roughness Rao of the journal. Curves based on the above results are plotted, which give a measure of the bearing life expenditure for running-in, and which can be used to obtain optimum values of journal roughness for minimizing the bearing life expenditure. 790893. (SP-448) Selecting Equipment for Failure Anal- ysis. Bruce E. Boardman, Deere &amp; Co. For every failure, whether at the field test site or with the customer, there is a related cause. It is imperative that the exact cause be determined in order that appropriate corrective action may be taken. The field test engineer is immediately faced with deciding where the analysis shall be performed. The choices range from analysis at the field test site to sending the parts to the materials laboratory. The key in handling the analysis lies in knowing what equipment is available and the capabilities of each. This paper offers guidelines to aid in the decision whether a failure should be analyzed immediately in the field or returned to the laboratory. Furthermore, the capabilities of individual pieces of equipment are de- scribed while simultaneously outlining methods which were developed to assist the failure analyst in selecting which tools would be most appropriate for a given analysis. The majority of the tests available, including hardness, fatigue properties, optical and electron micros- copy and x-ray and electron spectrometers, are discussed with particular attention given to those tools most often used during failure analysis in the ground vehicle industry. Examples are included to illustrate the types of infor- mation found and how that information relates to the cause of failure. For those cases where broken parts are returned to the laboratory, suggestions are offered in how to protect the parts so that the failure analyst will still be able to uncover the cause of failure. 790894. (SP-448) Post-Processing Graphics for Brittle Failure Analysis. M. S. Brueggert, John Deere Product Engrg. Center, Waterloo, I A.

Performance Comparison of Different Drive Systems for Battery Electric Vehicles. John Morton, Cableform Ltd.; and Graham S. Thexton, Cableform Inc. Recent advances in the application of electronics to the improvement of the control systems for battery electric vehicles have allowed the inclusion of completely stepless systems with regenerative braking down to 5% armature speed for use on series wound motors. These features necessitate the revaluation of the controller/motor op- tions. 790896. Thyristor Chopper Equipment Controlled by Magnetic Phase Shifter for Battery Forklift. Jin-ichi Toyama, Shigeru Kuriyama, Hisakatsu Kiwaki and Masahiko Ibamoto, Hitachi, Ltd. Magnetic Phase Shifter is the controlling element to make integral action, excellent in anti-noise performance and makes high stable and reliable controlling device. We have developed a new compact thyristor chopper equipment controlled by Magnetic Phase Shifter. This equipment has simple controlling circuit and many functions such as wide range duty factor control, adjustable plugging brake, speed up by field weakening, anti-rollback control and so on. 790897.

The Stanadyne DB2 Distributor Pump for Me- dium Duty Diesels. T. Hess and D. Salzeber, Stanadyne, Hartford, CT. The DB2 is a refinement of a design that has been in production for 27 years. Features have been recently developed to meet the unique requirements of passenger cars and light duty trucks. Because of legislated exhaust emissions standards that apply to these vehicles, control of timing and injection characteristics is critical. The DB2 incorporates modifications to precisely regulate these functions. Considerable material describing injection pump mounting is presented to assist the engine designer. DB2 applications include 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 cylinder engines for maximum ratings of approximately 25 B HP/cylinder. 790900. Some Characteristics and Advantages of an Accumulator-Type, High-Pressure Fuel Injection System. Stephen P. Bergin and Jay A. Bolt, The Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. This paper presents an experimental study of the per- formance of several fuel injection nozzles actuated by pressure pulses derived from an accumulator maintained at steady high pressure. Good performance and several types of poor performance of these nozzles are charac- terized and mapped in terms of variables that can be readily measured, and that could be automatically controlled. The results reveal a new approach for controlling high pressure fuel injection that could provide good system performance over an extremely broad range of fuel injection rates. Although the results of this work are general in scope, they might be applied most advan- tageously to open-chamber, stratified-charge, spark-ig- nited engines. The potential application of this approach to such an engine is discussed. 790901. The Robert Bosch In-Line Pump for Diesel Engines, Type MW, Design, Application and Further Development. Max Straubel, Reinhard Schwartz and Karsten Hummel, Robert Bosch GmbH. The range of Robert Bosch in-line pumps is designed for engines with cylinder outputs of up to 200 kW. Within this family of pumps the M W pump is used in small IDI engines and medium-sized DI engines with cylinder outputs in the region of 30 kW. More stringent exhaust emission legislation and the need to ensure optimum fuel economy call for efficient fuel-injection systems for diesel engines. In both of its designs the new MW pump meets these more exacting requirements and forms the contribution of Robert Bosch GmbH toward developing advanced diesel engines. 790902. New Design Concept for Komatsu D455A Bull- dozer and the Actual Results. Akio Terai, Herb Aoki and R. H. Stanage, Komatsu America Corp. This paper covers new design concepts and major steps required in the design and development process of a giant bulldozer. These major steps include the motivation for development produced by demands for increased pro- ductivity, methods used to overcome technical difficulties, and quality control techniques. The basis of the rationale for making the development decision involved analysis of cost magnification in relation to increased machine productivity. To improve 133</page><page sequence="117">790903-790921 reliability, a combination of bench and field testing was utilized. This was followed by two machines operating in a U.S. coal mine over a two-year period for final testing. 790903. Calculation Method of Diesel Ignition Delay Using Its Momentary Value. Leon Gross, Technion-Israel Institut of Technology, Haifa. The paper deals with a calculation method of ignition delay period &lt;/&gt;ig.d. in diesel engines using its momentary values &lt;t&gt;y. Starting from beginning of the injection &lt;/&gt;in.b. and going along with the compression, or in backwards direction from combustion beginning &lt;1&gt;d.b., we calculate the variable &lt;¡&gt;y for every equal small increment of crank angle A&lt;J&gt;(1°CA or less). For the full ignition delay, the sum of the A4 &gt;/&lt;/&gt;y reaches the value 1. Using simple computation we obtain calculated curves &lt;/&gt;ig.d. = f(&lt;J&gt;in.b.), &lt;/&gt;in.b. = f(&lt;J&gt;c.b.) etc. The 4&gt;y s are calculated from the empirical equation 4&gt;y = a.pyb.exp(c/Ty), where py, Ty are the momentary pressure and temperature resp. and a,b,c are the constants. There are difficulties in determination of these constants as well as of the mean polytropic coefficient (during the ignition delay) needed for the calculations. Experimental data for comparisons with the calculated values are taken from a D.I. high speed laboratory diesel engine. 790904. Comparison of Wire Rope Life Using Nylon and Steel Sheaves - Part 1: Test Methodology and Comparison of Wire Rope Endurance Life. John H. Chen, The Polymer Corp., Reading, PA; and C. R. Ursell, Southwest Research Inst., San Antonio, TX. A methodology was developed to test wire rope endurance characteristics to ANSI B30.5 removal criteria. Under field simulated loads, wire rope was cycled so that each rope section had 180° contact with one nylon sheave and one steel sheave until the rope replacement criteria designated by wire breaks was attained. At a load equal to 10% and 20% of the ultimate strength of the wire rope, the rope at the nylon sheave side endured 4.5 and 2.2 times as many cycles as compared to the wire rope on the steel sheave side. 790905. Comparison of Wire Rope Life Using Nylon and Steel Sheaves - Part II: New Concept to Im- proved Predictability of Wire Rope Remaining Strength After Cycling. John H. Chen and Paul E. Gage, The Polymer Corp., Reading, PA. An analysis has been made of the modes of failure of cycled wire rope. It has been found that there is a linear relation between the remaining strength and a newly introduced fatigue factor. The linear relation, and devi- ations from it, can be used to evaluate reliability of wire rope/sheave systems. This relationship can also be used to predict the remaining strength of a wire rope after failure criteria is reached. 790906. Method of Designing Bolted Joints for Mounting Large-Diameter Bearings. Eckart Gusovius, Rotek Inc., Aurora, OH. A method is presented for calculating fastener require- ments for use in mounting large diameter anti-friction bearings. Procedures for calculating static and dynamic fastener loading and capacity are presented, taking into account fastener diameter and length, resilience of the fastener and the clamped parts, fastener grade, number of interfaces, preload scatter, tightening method, etc. 1979 SA E Transactions 790907. Tolerancing Large Diameter Bearings. Bradley A. Pritts, Rotek Inc., Aurora, OH. Methods are presented for analyzing large diameter bearing applications in order to determine the broadest dimensional tolerances which are consistent with re- quirements of fit and function. Industry conventions for dimensioning and tolerancing are presented with special reference to position tolerancing.

The 1979 National Mini-Indy Competition, An Overview. Kurt M. Marshek and Gregory C. Andries, Univ. of Houston. An Indy type event with 13 university teams was held in Houston, Texas that was comparable to the 500 itself. There were protests, minor smash-ups, broken transmis- sions, winners and losers. This Mini-Indy competition is reviewed to aid future hosts and coordinators. 790909. The Mini-Indy '79 Design Project at the Uni- versity of Tulsa. Robert D. Strattan and David C. Jackson, Univ. of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK. The Mini-Indy and Mini-Baja competitions are extremely useful tools in the educational development of the undergraduate engineer. The course structure and the requirements and responsibilities of the students are described. The design approach for the Mini-Indy *79 undertaken by the University of Tulsa engineering students is explained. The resulting vehicle is described and the design trade-offs, testing and a final evaluation of the project are discussed. 790921. Diesel Fuel - Availability, Trends and Perform- ance. E. G. Barry, F. J. Hills and L. J. McCabe, Mobil Research and Development Corp. There is projected to be an increasing demand for the middle distillate (350-640° F) boiling range portion of the crude oil barrel. This is due to increased vehicle diesel- ization and increased demand for kerosine type jet fuel. To improve jet fuel supply, specifications have been relaxed permitting the use of diesel fuel boiling range 134</page><page sequence="118">790922-790926 material. Since no similar change has been made in diesel fuel specifications, its potential availability is reduced. Increases in the 90% recovery temperature to 680° F to improve diesel fuel supply in Europe have already been made. Similar changes should be made in the U.S. A review of the performance of fuels indicates that there should be no substantial adverse effects when these higher boiling fuels are used. This change could provide as much as 4-1/2% (on crude) more distillate. 790922. Diesel Fuel Quality Trends in Canada. D. E. Steere, Research Department, Imperial Oil Limited; and T. J. Nunn, Marketing Depart- ment, Imperial Oil Limited. Diesel fuel is currently showing the most rapid growth rate of all petroleum fuel products and is projected to maintain this well into the 1980's. Middle distillates production in Canada has always been high because of heating oil requirements, resulting in a gasoline to middle distillate ratio of 1:1. This ratio is expected to continue despite a decrease in the heating oil market because of the predicted increase in the diesel fuel market. In order to provide the volume needed for future diesel fuel demand there will have to be a drop in initial boiling points, an increase in final boiling points as well as the use of more cracked stocks. Canada is also faced with the refining of synthetic crudes which currently represent about 10% of crude production. These produce middle distillates with low cetane numbers. In order to overcome the problems created by these changes, we see the increased use of cetane improver additives to raise the cetane number of the diesel pool and the use of flow improver additives to enable higher cloud distillates to be used. As diesel fuels are being blended closer to the minimum cetane requirements, there is a need for better techniques for the monitoring of cetane number. 790923. Automotive Diesel Engines-Fuel Composition vs Particulates. Harvey A. Burley and Theodore L. Rosebrock, Advance Product Engineering, En- gineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Forty-six experimental diesel fuels have been tested in a modern automotive diesel engine, and the effect of fuel characteristics on particulate emissions, gaseous emis- sions, and fuel economy has been studied. Regression analysis of results established a relationship between particulate emissions and two fuel characteristics: (1) aromatic content and (2) volatility, especially as described by the 90% boiling point. Particulates could be reduced by lowering either aromatic content or 90% boiling point. The foregoing conclusions were based on a weighted five-load dynamometer schedule but appear to be confirmed by limited vehicle testing on the Federal Test Procedure. 1979 SA E Transactions 790924. Cycle-to-Cycle Variation with Low Ignition Qual- ity Fuels in a CFR Diesel Engine. David P. Sczomak and Naeim A. Henein, Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI. Cycle-to-cycle cylinder pressure variation has been ob- served in a CFR prechamber diesel engine when low ignition quality (low cetane number) fuels are burned. A statistical analysis of this phenomenon for various fuels and blends with cetane numbers as low as zero has been made. Operating conditions used were those specified by the ASTM Cetane Method for rating diesel fuels, in which the inlet air temperature is 150°F. Additional analysis was made at increased inlet air temperatures of 250° F and 350°F. The cycle-to-cycle variation has been characterized by the variation in the ignition (or pressure rise) delay time. It has been found to increase sharply as fuel cetane number is decreased below 20. The variation in dynamic injection timing was also measured and correlated with that for ignition delay. It has been concluded that the observed injection timing irregularities have no significant effect on ignition delay time, and that the autoignition process becomes unstable due to other factors when fuels of low ignition quality are burned. 1979 SA E Transactions 790925. Modified Fuels for Diesel Engines by Application of Unstabilized Emulsions. A. Lawson and A. J. Last, Ontario Research Foundation. An in-fuel-line mechanical emulsification has been devel- oped at Ontario Research (the ORF HydroShear) which is compatible with installation in the fuel system of both light duty and heavy duty diesel engines. The HydroShear has been used to prepare both water/diesel and methanol/diesel emulsions having particle sizes of a few microns and with sufficient stability to be used in unstabilized form in the fuel management system of diesel engines. The installation of the HydroShear on 97 and 149 kW diesel engines is described, together with its mode of operation. A comparative study of water/diesel fuel emulsions applied to both two and four stroke cycle diesel engines has shown exhaust emissions and engine performance to be sensitive to the general engine design employed. Greatest benefits were achieved with the four-stroke engine. Particulate and NOx emissions were reduced by up to 50%. Testing HydroShear capability to fuel engines with methanol/diesel emulsions has indicated that methanol can be used as a diesel fuel extender with this technique. Total particulate emissions were reduced 50%, with carbon black being reduced by 75%. 790926. Army Fire-Resistant Diesel Fuel. W. D. Weatherford, Jr., G. E. Fodor, D. W. Naegeli, E. C. Owens and B. R. Wright, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Laboratory, Southwest Research Institute; and F. W. Schaekel, U.S. 135</page><page sequence="119">790927-790932 Army Mobility Equipment Research and De- velopment Command. Various means have been investigated for reducing fuel fire vulnerability of Army combat vehicles by altering fuel compositions. Extensive laboratory studies have yielded clear-to-hazy fire-resistant fuel microemulsions of water in surfactant-stabilized diesel fuel, with and without an antimist agent. The surfactant is a mixture of reaction products of diethanolamine and oleic acid. Flammability and ballistic tests reveal diminished mist flammability with self-extinguishing pool fires, even at temperatures above the base fuel flash point. No difficulties have been encountered in starting, idling, and running unmodified diesel engines on such fuels under typical operating conditions. 790927. Effects on Fuel Economy and Driveability of Varying Dynamometer Road Load and Inertia Weight. Serge M. Dubuc, Mobile Sources Div., Environmental Protection Service, Environment Canada. Urban and highway fuel economy CVS tests were performed on three automobiles having different size engines - 4, 6 and 8 cylinders. The vehicles were tested at sixteen combinations of inertia weight settings and total road loads to simulate a wide range of weight/power ratios. Sensitivity of the vehicles to changes in total road load during the highway cycle and in inertia weight settings during the urban cycle were noted. Comments on driveability at certain ratios were recorded. Lastly, tests at selected weight/power ratios were performed using a 5-speed gearbox vehicle to study the fuel economy effect of changes in overall gear ratios. 790928. Ingredients of Fuel Economy. R. L. Bechtold, Dept. of Energy. A broad overview of passenger car fuel economy is presented. The main components of vehicle power requirement (aerodynamics, rolling resistance, and inertia) are discussed for steady-state and driving cycle condi- tions. The effects of driveline losses and parasitic losses are mentioned. Fuel effects (alcohols vs hydrocarbons) are discussed along with engine types and differences due to combustion systems. The total energy required to propel a vehicle is calculated over the Environmental Protection Agency urban/highway driving cycles. The effects of vehicle weight, size, shape, and tire type on vehicle power requirement are presented, and fuel economy trends are predicted. Estimates of the fuel economy of a vehicle with regenerative braking are made. 790929. Fuel Economy Trends In Passenger Car Fleets - Effects of Emissions Controls. D. S. Gray, Amoco Oil Co., J. H. Freeman, Sun Oil Co., J. L. Keller, Union Oil Co. of California; and W. J. Koehl, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. Records for 20,728 passenger cars covering 1967 through 1977 models were analyzed to see the effects of émissions controls on fuel economy. Data on weight, engine displacement, compression ratio, carburetion, transmis- sion type, axle ratio, air conditioning, and miles driven per month were obtained for each car. Linear regression analyses of these data showed design changes during this period affected fuel economy significantly. Around 1973, there were appreciable decreases in fuel economy relative to 1967 models, whereas for 1975 through 1977 increases were observed. Fuel economy for cars meeting California emission standards was lower than for those meeting Federal standards. 790930. Cost Effectiveness of 1985 Automobile Fuel Economy Standards. Carmen Difiglio, Div. of Conservation Policy, Dept. of Energy; Robert Dulla and K. G. Duleep, Energy and Envi- ronmental Analysis, Inc. The cost effectiveness of the current automobile fuel economy standards program is evaluated. A life cycle cost analysis is used to quantify the costs and benefits of fuel economy improvements stimulated by the program. The magnitude of these improvements is estimated by meas- uring the difference between the standards and a baseline "no standards" case. Due to the uncertainty associated with technology cost estimates, two scenarios are devel- oped to bound the cost of fuel economy improvement; an "optimistic" scenario using technology cost and MPG gains documented by DOT and another "pessimistic" scenario based on conservative technology cost and fuel economy estimates. A review of fuel economy legislation concludes that marginal cost effectiveness to the nation be a significant criterion for setting future fuel economy standards. Decreasing the 1985 fuel economy standard from 27.5 to 26.5 mpg is shown to result in net consumer losses without accounting for decreases in national benefits. The con- flicting requirements of increased costs due to fuel economy improvements, the consumer and national benefits which also result and other aspects of economic practicability are discussed and an overall frame work for setting future fuel economy standards is suggested. 790931. Further Results from the 1978 Fuel Economy Survey. Neil E. South, Environmental Research &amp; Energy Planning, Ford Motor Company. Further analyses of the 1978 in-use fuel economy survey are presented. Effects of usage on 1978 model year cars are determined. The in-use fuel economies are then adjusted to standardize for usage. The adjusted fuel economies have lower variability and yield better rela- tionships with metro-highway fuel economy ratings. 790932. Comparison of EPA and Inuse Fuel Economy Results for 1974-1978 Automobiles - An Analysis of Trends. Barry D. McNutt, U.S. Dept. of 136</page><page sequence="120">790933-790938 Energy; H. T. McAdams, Falcon Research and Development Co.; and Robert Dulla, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. The DOE inuse fuel economy data base was enlarged through the addition of data for 1978 as well as previous model years. A covariance analysis was used to identify variability among individual data sources. The analysis indicated that the variation among sources was small relative to the variation within individual sources and the sources pooled by model year. An unweighted linear regression in gallons per mile space was determined to be appropriate for evaluating the impact of the EPA to onroad relation on attainment of fuel economy standards and projection of fuel demand. The resulting model year relations did not significantly differ over the 15 to 25 mpg range. The data for the five model years were pooled, and a common regression was calculated. The regression relations, both model year and pooled model years, were analyzed for trends in shortfall as a function of mpg and time. The results of this analysis were compared to those of other studies and used to project the impact on fuel demand. 790933. Impact of Fuel Economy Information on Auto- mobile Purchase Choice. Martin F. Hunt, Jr., J. D. Power &amp; Associates. Drawing data from two separate surveys of vehicle owners, this paper addresses two fuel economy issues: importance of fuel economy and acceptance of selected technologies associated with improving fuel economy. Fuel economy is growing in importance and the Federal Mileage Program is perceived to have some usefulness. On the other hand, there is marked indif- ference about many of the technologies and resistance to those technologies increases with age. 790935. Improved Wear Metals Analysis for Lubricant Field Trials. L. L. McCorriston and W. M. Meston, Research and Development Dept., Gulf Canada Ltd. Field trials of lubricants require accurate wear metals analysis with no bias from additives, viscosity or base stock type. Conventional emission spectrographs rotrode methods often have errors of up to 25 percent from additives alone. A rotrode method using a nickel internal standard and a strontium buffer has been developed which eliminates almost all interferences. This new method has been applied to field testing of a wide variety of automotive and industrial lubricants. 1979 SA E Transactions 790936. New Method for Measurement of Engine Oil Consumption (S-Trace Method). Masanori Hanaoka, Atsushi Ise, Nobuyoshi Nagasaka, Hidetoshi Osawa, Yoshikuni Arakawa and Toshikazu Obata, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). A new method, the sulfur trace method (S-trace method), for measurement of engine oil consumption was inves- tigated. This method uses the sulfur, naturally contained in the engine oil, as an oil tracer. This method could be developed with the use of sulfur-free fuel and with the establishment of an analytical technique to determine the trace amount of sulfur dioxide in the exhaust gas. Measuring with this method is more rapid than the drain-weigh method and without the use of the special equipment which is used for radioactive materials. This S-trace method requires about 20 minutes of engine operating time, and has a detection capability of 1 gram per hour. The coefficient of variation is better than 10% at the oil consumption level of 20 grams per hour. The results using this method are satisfactory and agree with the drain-weigh method or with the radiometric method. Furthermore, with the application of the S-trace method, oil consumption of individual cylinders and oil consumption lost through either the valve guide assembly or the piston-cylinder assembly can be measured. 1979 SA E Transactions 790937. Lubricants for Highly Turbocharged Direct- Injection Diesel Engines. H. M. Davies, J. L. Stevens and D. K. Walters, Ethyl Corporation, Edwin Cooper Division. European legislative pressures with regard to power/ weight ratio and exhaust smoke levels, in conjunction with a market demand for low fuel consumption, have led to the development of turbocharged direct-injection diesel engines with brake mean effective pressure ratings in excess of 160 psi for truck operation. This trend has resulted in increased incidences of field problems in- volving high oil consumption and ring seizure resulting from cylinder wear or bore polishing as it is known in Europe. A laboratory engine test procedure, which is one of several alternatives, has been used to develop lubricants suitable for these highly turbocharged diesel engines. 790938. Some New Aspects of Deposit Effects on Engine Octane Requirement Increase and Fuel Economy. L. B. Graiff, Shell Development Co. Historically, the increase in octane requirement (OR) of a car engine with mileage was thought to be caused almost entirely by combustion chamber deposits. Tests with recent model V-8 engines, using a special technique for octane rating the individual cylinders of the engines, showed that certain intake-port-area deposits can have as great an effect on OR as combustion chamber deposits. Fuel consumption tests with these same engines showed that combustion chamber, intake valve, and particularly intake port deposits have a beneficial effect on fuel economy; that is, physically removing these deposits from the engines increased fuel consumption by up to 9%. The probable causes and implications of these findings are discussed. 1979 SA E Transactions 137</page><page sequence="121">790939-790943 790939. Effect of Gasoline Octane Quality and Hydro- carbon Composition on Afterrun. John C. Ingamells, Chevron Research Co. A survey of recent-model cars was made to evaluate their tendency to afterrun (continued running of the engine after the ignition is turned off) and to see what devices were used to control afterrun. The effects of idle operating conditions on afterrun were studied with two of the cars. Thirteen of the cars were used to evaluate the effects of gasoline octane quality and hydrocarbon composition on afterrun. The results of the studies give a good overall picture of how afterrun is affected by idle settings, octane quality, and fuel composition. 790940. Improved Fuel Economy by Better Utilization of Available Octane Quality. W. E. Betts, Esso Research Centre. The spread of octane requirements due to tolerances in engine manufacture has been investigated to indicate the potential improvement in fuel economy which could be achieved by making better use of the available gasoline octane quality. The wide spread of octane requirements in the 48 cars studied resulted in "octane waste", a measure of the inefficient use by engines of the available octane quality. The average waste was three octane numbers and is associated with variations in compression ratio. The wasted octane can be made available to improve fuel economy through tighter control of manufacturing tol- erances on combustion chamber volumes. 790941. Engine OH Additive Effects on the Deterioration of a Stoichiometric Emissions Control (C-4) System. Frank Caracciolo and James A. Spearot, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Phosphorus, originating from the commonly used engine oil additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDP), contrib- uted to the deterioration in the performance of a stoichiometric emissions control system. Data obtained from a series of 200-hour engine-dynamometer tests suggest two separate means for phosphorus-induced system deterioration: reduced CO, NOx, and HC conver- sion efficiencies due to catalyst poisoning; increased oxygen sensor rich-to-lean response time and altered oxygen sensor output voltage due to sensor contamina- tion. The presence of an alkaline metal detergent in the ZDP-containing engine oil resulted in less deterioration of converter HC efficiency, but had no effect on the other system performance parameters. 1979 SA E Transactions 790942. Deactivation of Three-Way Catalysts by Fuel Contaminants: - Lead, Phosphorus and Sulfur. W. B. Williamson and H. S. Gandhi, Engi- neering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co.; M. E. Heyde and G. A. Zawacki, Advanced Engine Engineering, Ford Motor Co. Poisoning of a typical platinum-rhodium (Pt-Rh) auto- motive three-way catalyst (TWC) was determined as a function of lead (Pb), sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) fuel levels, thermal aging and sulfur dioxide (S02) content in the evaluation fuel. In laboratory studies catalysts were durability tested in pulse-flame reactors followed by flow-reactor activity measurements. Engine dynamome- ter-aged catalysts were evaluated on a slave vehicle. For Pt-Rh TWCs the activities for nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) conver- sions were poisoned by trace levels of 1-6 mg Pb/gal (0.3-1.6 g/m3). When the peak temperature in the aging cycle was increased from 730 to 870°C (1346 to 1598°F), the activities improved significantly. In an attempt to mimic the effect on TWCs of misfueling with Pb levels typical of commercially available leaded fuels, TWC activities were severely poisoned. Upon reverting to fuel containing trace Pb levels, the CO activity was restored, but the NO and HC activities were only partially recovered. The Pt-Rh TWCs were poisoned by the exhaust from fuel containing 0.03 wt % S, but not by that from fuel containing up to 8 mg P/gal (2.1 g/m3). In the evaluation of thermally-aged catalysts, S02 suppressed gross NO conversions and ammonia formation of Pt catalysts, but had little effect on Rh catalysts. Vehicle results for a TWC-only system indicated significantly lower HC, CO, and gross NOx conversions when the S02 content of the exhaust gas was increased during rich operation with air/fuel fluctuations. In TWC systems followed by an oxidation catalyst, no effect from increased S02 was observed on HC, CO or net NOx emissions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790943. The Influence of Sulfur Species on the Labo- ratory Performance of Automotive Three Com- ponent Control Catalysts. George C. Joy, George R. Lester and Frank S. Molinaro, UOP Inc., Des Plaines, IL. In order to meet the emission standards of 1980 and 1981, catalysts which can simultaneously reduce hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide emissions will come into wide usage. Just as important will be fuel manage- ment systems that maintain tight control of the air/fuel ratio. Since the 1981 standards will be quite stringent, the effects of poisons such as lead, phosphorus and sulfur on the catalyst will be very important. A study was conducted to determine the effects of different amounts of sulfur dioxide on the activity of a Pt, a Rh catalyst and a fully formulated three component control catalyst. These catalysts were tested in the laboratory employing a synthetic exhaust, that which simulates real automotive exhaust. The catalysts were tested under various conditions that would be encoun- tered during normal closed-loop operation. S02 affects the catalysts differently under each of the above conditions. 138</page><page sequence="122">790944-790949 Under dynamic conditions the S02 has very little effect on the catalytic activity, but some influence on oxygen storage, whereas the catalyst activity is extremely inhib- ited under fuel-rich and non-oxidizing conditions. These results correlate with those in the literature. 790944. Gasoline Production and Sulfur Content. Eugene I. Motte, Union Oil Company of California. Control of sulfur in gasoline may be required because of sulfate emissions when using three-way catalysts. The sulfur content of gasoline is primarily a function of the type of crude processed. There is a trend toward processing more high sulfur crudes due to crude availa- bility. Reducing sulfur to about 150-300 ppm will cost about 2-3C/gallon of gasoline and an investment of $3-5 billion in 1979 dollars. 790945. Fuel Economy Improvements with Friction-Mod- ified Engine Oils in Environmental Protection Agency and Road Tests. Merrill L. Haviland and Malcolm C. Goodwin, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. The automotive and oil industries are continuing their efforts to improve fuel economy through lubricant modifications. As part of this program, fuel economy with experimental and commercial friction-modified engine oils has been measured in EPA 55/45 and road tests. These oils contained either soluble or insoluble friction- modifying additives. Each of the experimental oils containing soluble friction-modifying additives was produced by blending an additive with a commercial engine oil. Fuel economy improvements provided by the additives averaged 1.2 percent in road tests. Adding molybdenum disulfide to both the engine oil and rear axle lubricant improved EPA 55/45 test fuel economy 4.6 percent. Three commercial friction-modified engine oils were evaluated. Fuel economy with each oil was compared to that obtained using a commercial nonfriction-modified oil supplied by the marketer of the friction-modified oil. Each comparison was made using one car to eliminate car- to-car variability. In EPA and road tests, fuel economy with these oils improved an average 2.9 and 4.1 percent, respectively, over that obtained using the nonfriction- modified engine oils. Of these oils, the two containing soluble additives were most effective in improving fuel economy under warmed-up operation, whereas the graph- ite-containing oil was most effective during engine warm-up. 790946. Fuel Economy Characteristics of Motor Oils as Measured in a Consumer Road Test. K. H. Turnbull and G. S. Leithead, Beacon Research Labs., Texaco Inc. A 215 car "consumer type" road test was run to investigate the influence of various motor oils on fuel economy. Under "real life" conditions, the differences between conventional 10W-40 oils and several 10W-40 oils formulated for fuel economy were small. Further- more, such differences would be difficult for the indi- vidual consumer to detect as a result of other variables such as changes in driving patterns and the effect of seasonal temperature changes. The methods for adjusting the data to compensate for these factors are explained. 790947. Advanced Fuel Economy Engine Oils. A. G. Papay, Ethyl Corporation, Edwin Cooper Divi- sion, St. Louis, Missouri, E. B. Rifkin, R. L. Shubkin and P. F. Jackisch, Ethyl Corporation, Research and Development Department, Ferndale, Michigan; and R. B. Dawson, Ethyl Corporation, Edwin Cooper Division, Bracknell, Berkshire, England. In designing fuel economy oils, two useful approaches are reduction of viscosity and incorporation of friction reducers. To achieve viscosity reduction without incurring problems of high oil consumption and possible inter- ference with catalyst or oxygen sensor performance, the use of part-synthetic lubricants can be helpful. In this way, oil volatility (therefore oil consumption) is reduced and fuel economy is improved without incurring engine operating penalties. Friction reducers also can be used to improve fuel economy. The combination of these ap- proaches furnishes the benefits of both. Laboratory and road testing of such combinations show important fuel economy benefits in normal vehicle operation, greater than those achievable from either approach alone. In addition, all other engine performance requirements are completely met. This advance in engine oil formulation technology, which opens up new possibilities to both vehicle manufacturers and consumers, is being further pursued. 790949. Testing the Fuel Economy Characteristics of Engine Oils. T. F. Lonstrup and H. E. Bachman, PARAMINS Technology Division, Exxon Chemical Company; and C. R. Smith, Research Department, Imperial Oil Limited. This paper presents new techniques for the interpretation of engine and vehicle results on prototype fuel-efficient motor oils. A case history is presented which follows the component selection process through laboratory friction and bench engine screening tests. The resulting optimized lubricant formulation was demonstrated in an automobile dynamometer test, resulting in approximately 2% better MPG than that of the proposed ASTM SAE 20W/30 reference oil. The capabilities and limitations of the available test methods are discussed from the perspective of PARAMINS experience. An important part of FE data interpretation is the comparison of experimental results to the estimated maximum realizable friction reduction and fuel savings potential. This requires an understanding of the portion of total mechanical friction contributed by 139</page><page sequence="123">790950-790957 solid-solid (boundary) friction and by viscous (hydro- dynamic) losses. The authors show how laboratory friction measurements were used as a means for exam- ining vehicle results in these terms. 790950. Evaluation of a Fuel Efficient Long Drain Ester Based Lubricant. Gordon L. Willette, Hateo Chemi- cal Corp., Fords, NJ. A new SAE 5W-30 synthetic lubricant has been developed using a mixed ester base stock, a shear stable VI improver and a special DI additive package. Durability evaluation in a "combination tire test" and fuel economy studies in the SAE J- 1082 procedure indicate extended drain capability and fuel economy benefits for the synthetic lubricant. 790951. Some Statistical Aspects of Testing Engine Oils for Fuel Economy. E. R. Jones and L. J. Painter, Chevron Research Company. Currently there is considerable interest in developing fuel-efficient engine oils. However, this development is hampered by the fact that the variability of automobile fuel economy tests is often as large as the fuel economy benefit being measured. It is essential, therefore, that tests of fuel-efficient engine oils be statistically designed and properly analyzed. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various designs and describe the proper ways of analyzing such data. In addition, general guidelines are presented for determining the test fleet size and amount of replicate testing required. 790952. Determination of Individual Aldehyde Concen- trations in the Exhaust of a Spark Ignited Engine Fueled by Alcohol/Gasoline Blends. M. S. Harrenstien, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., New Mexico State Univ., K. T. Rhee, Dept. of Mech., Ind., and Aerospace Engrg., Rutgers Univ.; and R. R. Adt, Jr., Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Miami. Individual aldehyde (and acetone) emissions were meas- ured from the exhaust gas of a premixed multicylinder spark ignition engine fueled with Indolene and blends of Indolene and either methanol or ethanol. The engine was operated at constant speed (2000 RPM) and MBT spark advance with fuel-air equivalence ratios (i&gt;) of 0.96, 0.90 and 0.82. During operation at $ = 0.82, the engine experienced lean-limit misfiring. The DNPH method with a gas chromatographic finish was employed to obtain exhaust gas concentrations of aldehydes and acetone. Also, the methods used in the past for measuring engine exhaust aldehyde and acetone data were compared to each other and briefly discussed. Use of the alcohol blends increased the total aldehyde emission level. Formaldehyde was the largest component, exhibiting a continual increase with increasing alcohol blend level. Acetaldehyde, while exhibiting a small decrease with increasing methanol percentage, showed a marked increase when the ethanol blend was used. Acetone was the only specie measured with the DNPH method that showed a marked increase when the engine was operated in the lean misfire region ($ = 0.82). The C3 aldehydes were successfully separated and quantified. It was found that acrolein emissions did not increase when the blends were used; in fact, a slight decrease was observed. Propionaldehyde exhibited a decrease when the methanol blends were used. Samples taken in the exhaust manifold, upstream of an oxidizing catalyst, and downstream of the catalyst, indicated that aldehydes and acetone are partially destroyed in the exhaust system and virtually completely destroyed by the catalyst. 790954. The Effects of Methanol Injection on Emission and Performance in a Carbureted SI Engine. Cheng Ping Chiù, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison; and L. H. Hong, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Cheng Kung Univ. (Republic of China, Taiwan). A single cylinder carburetor SI engine with a modified L type cylinder head and equipped with a fuel injector was used to inject methanol into the combustion chamber. Four series of runs at an engine speed of 2500 rpm were made. One series with different values of X was performed with gasoline, and the other three series methanol was injected into the gasoline-air mixture. Each series of methanol injected run was supplied with the same energy input per cycle to correspond to that of the gasoline. The results of the experiments indicated that the performance (BHP) of the engine was proportional to the energy input of the mixture up to about 50% methanol injected. With the equivalence air-fuel ratio above X = 1.15 (lean mixture), it was found the NOx concentration decreased more than 30% while the BSFC remained constant. 790956. Alcohols in Diesel Engines - A Review. Henry Adelman, Univ. of Santa Clara. Pure alcohols and alcohol-diesel fuel blends have been compared to diesel fuels in terms of engine power, efficiency and emissions. It is apparent that pure alcohols are poor diesel fuels as their properties are significantly different from the traditional fuels. These differences are examined and in some instances methods of offsetting the alcohols' deficiencies are assessed. Further areas of study are identified since it is possible that some regions of the world will need to use alcohols as diesel fuel extenders in the near future. 790957. Alternate Fuels and Alternate Prime Movers in Non-Highway Transportation. Eldred N. Cart, Jr. and James Percival, Exxon Research and Engrg. Co. 140</page><page sequence="124">790958-790974 At some point in the future, the transportation system will have to start to use nonpetroleum fuels. One area of the transportation system that is critical is the non-highway (marine, railroad, pipeline and aircraft) since it accounts for about 80% of the freight-ton miles moved in the U.S. With the long-life times of the engines used in this area, and the time it takes to introduce a new prime mover or new fuel, it is important to consider the use of alternate fuels now. This paper covers the factors considered in evaluating alternate fuels and prime movers for non- highway transportation and presents a future outlook on possible fuels and prime movers. 790958. Diesel Oil and Ethanol Mixtures for Diesel- Powered Farm Tractors. John Strait and J. J. Boedicker, Univ. of Minnesota; and K. C. Johansen, Loram Maintenance of Way, Inc. Absolute ethanol can be mixed with No. 1 diesel oil without separation if the mixture remains free of water. Mixtures of diesel oil and up to 30 percent by volume of ethanol were used in laboratory and field experiments in diesel tractor engines. When engines were operated on fuels containing ethanol, the maximum power output of the engines was reduced, fuel consumption increased, engine noise increased, and the delay period was extended. These changes in engine operating character- istics increased in magnitude as the proportion of ethanol in the fuel increased. No significant performance characteristic of the diesel engine measured in this study was improved by the use of a diesel oil-ethanol blend to replace diesel oil to fuel the engine. Based upon this study, there appears to be no valid technical reason to recommend that diesel-powered farm tractors be operated on a mixture of diesel oil and ethanol in preference to diesel oil. 790959. 1970 Passenger Car High Altitude Emission Baseline. J. B. Edwards and J. W. Shiller, Ford Motor Co., W. S. Fagley, Chrysler Corp., D. R. Liljedahl, Automotive Testing Laboratories, Inc., S. W. Martens, General Motors Corp., H. B. Weaver, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers As- sociation of the U.S., Inc.; and H. J. Wimette, American Motors Corp. The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments allow the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to set high altitude emission standards for 1981-83, but specify that any such standards may not be more stringent than comparable sea level standards - relative to 1970 emission levels. Since available high altitude emission data from 1970 models were incomplete and controversial, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association contracted with Automotive Testing Laboratories, Inc. to test a fleet of 25 1970 cars. Results of the test program showed average increases in emissions at Denver's altitude, compared to sea level, to be about 30% for evaporative HC, 57 to 60% for exhaust HC, 215 to 247% for CO and -46 to -47% for NOx. Corresponding HC and CO exhaust emission baselines would be 6.4 to 6.6 and 108 to 118 g/mi respectively. 1979 SA E Transactions 790972. (P-83) An Optimization Capability for Auto- motive Structures. James A. Bennett and Mark F. Nelson, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, Michigan. Mathematical structural optimization methods have been proposed as one way to design lightweight vehicles. This paper describes the development and application of these methods to automotive structures. Because of the wide range of loading conditions that an automobile must be designed for, it is necessary to develop an optimization technique which will consider multiple load cases (such as static, inertia relief, and dynamic) applied to the structure with different boundary conditions (such as symmetric and antisymmetric). In addition, since the optimization algorithm will require many structural analyses as it guides the design to minimum weight, it is imperative that these analyses be as efficient as possible so that the computational cost will not be prohibitive. The major emphasis is on beam repre- sentations of the entire structure for preliminary design, although subassemblies of beams and plates for more detailed analysis can also be handled. 1979 SA E Transactions 790973. (P-83) Light Weight Design of the Sides of a Typical 100 Ton High Side Gondola Car. Raphael T. Haftka, Illinois Institute of Tech- nology; and Birendra Prasad, Association of American Railroads. The paper describes the application of a general purpose optimization code, PARS to the design of the sides of a 100 ton high side gondola car. PARS (Program for Analysis and Resizing of Structures), a companion code to the SPAR finite element package, is used for optimizing structures modeled by finite elements. The optimization algorithm uses an extended interior penalty function and Newton's method for unconstrained minimization. The sides of the gondola car are modeled by beam and plate finite elements. Manufacturing requirements are accounted for by design variable linking and the sides are designed subject to stress and displacement constraints. The design is obtained according to the specifications for design, fabrication and construction of freight cars recommended by the Association of American Railroads. 1979 SA E Transactions 790974. (P-83) Computer Optimization of Engine Mounting Systems. Stephen R. Johnson and Jay W. Subhedar, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp., Warren, Mich. Engine mounting system tuning by experimental methods used during vehicle development is a very time consuming 141</page><page sequence="125">790975-790979 process. The degree of system optimization achieved relying on this approach alone is highly dependent upon the development engineer's experience, the allowable flexibility in modifying the system late in the vehicle program and the available time before the vehicle is scheduled for production. This situation should be helped if the initial mounting configuration provided to the development activity is near optimum. Defining a near optimum initial mounting configuration is not an easy task by any means due to the complex nature of the powerplant inertia properties, the packaging constraints on the mount locations, as well as the individual mount rate ratio limitations imposed by manufacturability. The objective of this paper is to present the computer simulation and optimization methods developed to sim- plify and expedite the process of defining an optimized mounting system configuration satisfying the user defined goals for system dynamic characteristics. Also discussed are the general design considerations and constraints for engine mounting systems. 790975. (P-83) Optimal Designs with Alternate Materials Suitable for High-Volume Production. David C. Chang, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, Michigan. This paper is concerned with optimal designs of thin-sheet double-layer panels made of alternate materials which are suitable for high-volume automotive production. The materials considered are conventional sheet metals such as steel and aluminum, for their suitability in stamping; and chopped-fiber composites such as glass-fiber and carbon- fiber reinforced sheet molding compounds (SMC), for their potential of high production rates in compression molding. Structural optimization techniques are used to obtain the minimum-weight designs of a typical double-layer panel made of each material considered. Potential weight-savings of each type of material under different design considerations are compared. 1979 SA E Transactions 790976. (P-83) A Finite Element Solution for the Coupled Dynamic Interaction Behavior of a Flexible Vehicle Traveling on a Flexible Guideway. George E. Weeks and Thomas L. Cost, The University of Alabama, University, Alabama. A numerical technique is developed for analyzing the coupled, transient, dynamic, interaction behavior of a high-speed, flexible vehicle propelled along a flexible guideway. The spatial behavior of the vehicle is modeled by the finite element method as a Euler beam with sectionally constant cross-section properties while a summation of the natural mode solutions are used to model the spatial behavior of the guideway. The mag- nitudes of the time-dependent front and rear vehicle suspension forces are assumed to be proportional to the relative displacements and displacement rates between the vehicle and the guideway at the points of support. The resulting time-dependent coupled differential equations of motion are then numerically integrated in time to obtain the transient dynamic response of the system. The results presented include a comparison of vehicle accelerations and guideway deflections, as predicted when the vehicle is rigid, to those obtained when the vehicle has various degrees of flexibility. 1979 SA E Transactions 790977. (P-83) Stress Analysis Using the Boundary Integral Analysis Technique. Wayne E. Carroll, University of Central Florida, Department of Civil Engineering &amp; Environmental Sciences, Orlando, Florida. The present paper discusses the boundary integral analysis technique and its characteristics as a stress analysis tool. In particular, the fundamental differences between this technique and the more familiar finite element method are discussed. Initially, attention will focus on a discussion of the theoretical preliminaries necessary to the understanding of this modeling technique. This discussion is a broad overview of the manner in which the boundary integral equation is developed for the elastostatic problem. This discussion is followed by arguments that allow the conversion of the integral equation to a set of simul- taneous algebraic equations that represent the physical problem under investigation. Example problems document the effectiveness of this analysis technique and conclude this paper. 1979 SA E Transactions 790978.

Kline, Mechanical Engineering Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan; and Kenneth N. Morman, Structural Analysis De- partment, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. In structural modeling and optimum design considera- tions, three-dimensional stress analyses are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, a hybrid technique for the analysis of full three-dimensional stress problems is developed. Using this technique, the finite element and boundary integral stress analysis methods are combined. Solutions to several stress concentration problems are given.

(P-83) Combined Shallow Spherical Shell and Finite Element Method of Panel Stiffness. 142</page><page sequence="126">790980-790984 Hikmat F. Mahmood, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The study is a combination of finite element method and the basic equations of shallow spherical shell to determine the required stiffness of outer surface panel. One finite element model is run and the required stiffness for different thickness or sweep is achieved from the shell equations by numerical iteration. Thus, the many finite element trials required to evaluate the clay surface can be avoided. Iso-stiffness curves are also presented with a direct conversion of panel thickness from steel to aluminum. A computer program for this method has been developed and applied for hoods, deck lids and roofs of various models. It is found that the stiffness results, in general, are satisfactory. In this case of a panel with outboard character lines the center unsupported area shows more accurate results than the outboard area. 790980. (P-83) Design Analysis of Automotive Composite Structures. M. F. Kowalski, D. S. Fine and R. K. Herrmann, Chevrolet Motor Division, Gen- eral Motors Corp., Warren, Michigan. Advanced fiber reinforced composites offer potential structural mass reduction opportunities due to their many unique properties. Because of major differences in the mechanics of these materials compared with conventional metals, the introduction of advanced composites will have a radical impact on the automotive structural design process. It will require intensive interaction between manufacturing, material and analysis disciplines. In the past, finite element modeling has played an important role in the design analysis of structures composed of conven- tional materials. This paper discusses a modified finite element analysis procedure appropriate for interaction with an automotive structural composite design program. It is based on SQ5 program which has been modified to use the Tsai-Wu tensor polynomial lamina strain failure criterion. 790981. (P-83) Buckling Analysis of Laminated Compos- ite Circular Cylindrical Shells. James G. Harper and Anthony N. Palazo tto, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Air Force Insti- tute of Technology, School of Engineering, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The effects of prebuckling displacements on the buckling of laminated composite circular cyclindrical shells are investigated. Both axial compression and pure torsion are considered for two shell geometries with length to thickness ratios usually associated with container vessels. A clamped prebuckling boundary condition is used for all analysis with four boundary conditions applied during the buckling process. The shell walls are made up of a 6 ply laminate with several symmetric ply orientations. The study was made using the STAGS computer code, utilizing the linear bifurcation branch with linear pre- buckling displacements. The results are compared to the buckling loads determined when prebuckling displace- ments are neglected. It is shown that prebuckling deformations generally tend to decrease the buckling load of a composite shell. It is also shown that prebuckling displacements can cause shell buckling before failure of the fibers occurs. 1979 SA E Transactions 790982. (P-83) Isoparametric Shell Finite Elements for Automotive Composite Structures. Michael D. Mathers, Engineering Mechanics Research Cor- poration, Oak Park, Michigan. Displacement-based isoparametric finite elements are developed and applied to problems of thick and thin laminated composite plates and shells. Transverse shear deformation, material anisotropy, and bending- extensional coupling are accounted for. Curvature and lamination parameters may vary smoothly or discontinu- ously. These elements have been implemented in the NISA finite element program and several example problems are discussed. A method for calculating the exact distribution of transverse (interlaminar) shear stresses in composite laminates is discussed and an example problem is solved using the present elements. Agreement with an exact solution is excellent. 790983. (P-83) Theoretical and Computational Methods for Composite Structures - A Survey of Comput- er Programs. Michael D.

(P-83) Lightweight Component Design Via Com- puter- Aided Engineering. G. D. Angus and Kenneth C. Maddux, Structural Dynamics Re- search Corporation, Milford, Ohio. Systematic computer-aided engineering (CAE) techniques are applied to the design of a lightweight automotive tailgate. Design loads and boundary conditions are defined by existing design specifications and testing an existing "reference" tailgate. Finite element techniques are employed to understand the load flow and performance of the reference tailgate, and also used to investigate alternative designs which maximize the benefits of aluminum, steel, and fiber- reinforced-plastic (FRP) designs. Trade-offs between yield, stiffness, and cost for the various materials are studied analytically; and a prototype FRP tailgate is manufactured to validate the finite element predictions. 143</page><page sequence="127">790985-790990 790985. (P-83) Load Introduction in Tubular Composite Specimens. R. Vanderby, Jr., Structural Anal- ysis, IIT Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois; I. M. Daniel and G. M. Koller, Experimental Stress Analysis, IIT Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois; and T. Liber, Reliability and Quality Engineering, Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Round Lake, Illinois. A study of load transfer at the ends of tubular composite laminates has been performed such that in-plane loads, singly or in any combination, can be passed between end tabs and the tubular structure in a way that will minimize stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities. Axi- symmetric anisotropic finite element analyses were per- formed to determine the stress concentrations through an evolution of end tab materials and configurations. Tapered end tabs that utilize multiple materials of increasing rigidity from the tubular specimen to the point of gripping were shown to be the most effective means of minimizing stress concentrations. The study shows the criticality of end design in transferring loads to tubular composite specimens and suggests several tapered end tab configurations that can substantially reduce stress con- centrations. 790986. (P-83) Acoustic Behaviour Analysis of Engine Blocks. Alexander I. Raibstein, Control Data GmbH, Frankfurt; and Werner P. Schulze Schwering, Ford Werke AG, Cologne. The acoustic behaviour of an engine block was analysed employing the finite element method. The procedure for assessing the acoustic behaviour was incorporated into an existing general purpose finite element program. The results obtained in the analysis correlated well with those extracted from modal tests. It is therefore concluded that a minimum of hardware testing in combination with analytical methods can yield an efficient and reliable problem solution. 790987. (P-83) Combustion Engine Stiffness Distribution and Dynamic Response. D. Barbiero, T. Chiosso, A. Garro and G. Roberi, FIAT Auto S.p.A., Corso Agnelli, 200, Torino, Italy. The following paper points out the use of finite elements method calculation in planning internal combustion engines. The crankcase is analyzed in such a way as to separate the thermal strain from the mechanical strain. Such analysis shows how liner deformation can be partly controlled and how much it conditions clearances gen- erating slap noise between piston and liner. The problem of coupling shaft and crankcase in one single dynamic system shows the interaction between the two members and evaluates with greater accuracy the consequent crankcase wall vibration. An experimental check con- cludes the analysis. 799988. (P-83) Van Frame Structural Evaluation. Frederick H. Hull, The Budd Company, Tech- nical Center. This paper describes the structural evaluation of a van production chassis frame, a light weight frame design and four other modified production frames.

The finite element analysis results are compared to laboratory frame bending and torsion measurements. 799989. (P-83) Computer Code for Predicting the Two- Dimensional Nonlinear Dynamic Response of Beam Structures Subjected to Transient Loads and Impacts. D. Meredith, Research Engineer, Structural Analysis Dept., Ford Motor Com- pany; E. A. Witmer, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and K. N. Morman, Jr., Structural Analysis Dept., Ford Motor Company. This paper describes the MENTOR (A/eredith Engi- neering Nonlinear Transient Oscillatory Response) II code, a finite element computer program for the analysis of planar beam structures undergoing large elastic-plastic deformations. The analysis includes the modeling of beam cross-section collapse due to either the direct application of a "crushing load" and/or extreme changes in curvature of the beam neutral axis. Collisions are treated within the MENTOR II program via a monitoring procedure which detects inter-element contact, determines the relative indentations, and calculates the associated local reactive pressure. The structural equations of motion are derived using Hamilton's principle and are discretized over the beam length using finite elements which are based upon cubic tangential and transverse displacement fields. The inte- gration in time of the equations of motion is accomplished by use of an explicit central difference scheme. The validity of the MENTOR II program is illustrated by comparing numerical solutions with experimental results for a variety of problems involving large defor- mation, elastic-plastic behavior. 1979 SA E Transactions 799999.

Miles, Ove Arup &amp; Partners, Structural Engineering Consultants (formerly a member of the Structural Design Group, School of Auto- motive Studies, Cranfield Institute of Technol- ogy). In order to satisfy the various international safety standards which currently exist, it is necessary that nearly all new vehicles be subject to a number of destructive tests 144</page><page sequence="128">790991-790995 before being made available to the public on the open market. Development programmes involving a series of such tests are very expensive and there is a growing need that reliable and economical design/analysis methods be made available. This paper attempts to present such a method. Using a relatively simple finite element computer programme which has been adapted to the particular needs of the motor industry, the analysis of a new prestige limousine is described. A background to the analytical method is presented, but the emphasis of the paper is on the engineering aspects of using the method. Reference is made to practical design considerations in several in- stances. The results of calculations predicting the per- formance of the structure when subject to FMVSS 214 and 216 are presented. 1979 SA E Transactions 790991.

A simplified bumper model was established for evaluation of relative damageability with respect to the geometrical and material properties of an automobile bumper. Apply- ing a nonlinear shell computer program developed at Ford Research Staff, we have studied the section of a prototype bumper and three idealized bumper sections.

A drop weight test was conducted on the prototype bumper model and the test results were found to be in good agreement with the analytical predictions. 1979 SA E Transactions 790992. (P-83) A Kinematic Approach to Crushing of Shell Structures. Włodzimierz Abramowicz and Tomasz Wierzbicki, Institute of Fundamental T echnological Research, Świętokrzyska 2 1 , Warsaw, Poland. The crushing process of thin platie shells is formulated as a problem of isometric transformation of surfaces. In terms of mechanics isometric transformation means inextensible deformation of the shell middle surface. In order to identify the mechanism of the formation of folds, tests were performed on axially compressed P.V.C, cylindrical panels. A simple method was then developed for predicting the force-shortening characteristics and mean crushing strength of compressed members. 790993.

The Calspan/Chrysler Research Safety Vehicle Program has developed a light weight vehicle with increased occupant and pedestrian crash protection over present vehicles. It was determined that for an efficient structure, high speed car-to-car aggressivity is not a function of either the struck or striking vehicle alone, but rather is a structural burden that must be shared by both vehicles. 790994. (P-83) Bus Roll Over Accident Simulation. M. M. Sadeghi, Research Officer, School of Au- tomotive Studies, Cranfield Institute of Tech- nology, Cranfield, Bedford; and G. H. Tidbury, Senior Lecturer, School of Automotive Studies, Cranfield Institute of Technology, Cranfield, Bedford. The paper describes the theoretical simulation of roll over accidents. A brief account of the findings of accident investigation into bus roll overs is given. This shows that most actual rolls occur with lateral vehicle motion. The simulation starts with a vehicle dynamics program which reconstructs manoeuvres necessary to initiate lateral motion. After impacting a 'kerb' the free body roll motion is simulated until the structure impacts the ground plane. When the roof structure impacts the ground a structural collapse program (CRASHD) is used to obtain the deformation history of the vehicle structure. The dynamic program allows for energy absorption by the ground and vehicle structure and simulates further rolling motion and impacts with structural collapse where appropriate. The vehicle may be rolling on level ground, down a slope, or falling from an elevated highway. As experience is gained on the modelling of structural collapse in other types of vehicle structures, it is believed that the program will enable certain accidents to be simulated theoretically. 790995. (P-83) An Interactive Computer Graphics Finite Element Modeling and Evaluation Program. R. R. Rysiewski, R. B. Katnik and H. D. Albers, Chevrolet Engineering Center, 30003 Van Dyke, Warren, MI. The Engineering Analysis Department of Chevrolet has been using finite element techniques for 10 years. The early model building techniques were primitive, cumber- some, and error prone. In 1973, an interactive graphics computer program called IMAGE (Interactive Modeling Augmented by Graphics Evaluation) was developed to facilitate finite element modeling and analysis. By 1976, the department was asked to apply finite element techniques to structural automotive parts that IMAGE could not handle. The need for an improved version of IMAGE was obvious. The IMAGE II system was designed to be the state-of-the-art, flexible, low cost and easy to use. The IMAGE II system can easily interface to several analysis programs. Presently, IMAGE II is interfaced with the McNeal-Schwendler version of NASTRAN and SATURN, an in house finite element analysis routine. NASTRAN is used for static and dynamic problems, while SATURN is used only for static problems. The finite element library has one, two, and three dimensional 145</page><page sequence="129">790996-791002 elements. The data base is open ended and new element types can be easily added. This paper will describe the hardware and software that compose the IMAGE II system. Furthermore, the capabilities of the system will be demonstrated by outlining the different steps: inputting the geometry, modeling the elements, adding forces and constraints, and analyzing the results. Examples will be used to clarify the various steps of the IMAGE II system. 790996. (P-83) Solid Finite Element Analysis - An Inter- active Graphics Approach. R. B. Katnik and M. D.

(P-83) Use of an Interactive Graphics Pre- and Post-Processor System in Finite Element Anal- ysis for Automobile Design. E. Allia, M. Allocco and A. Garro, FIAT Auto S.p.A., Turin, Italy. In the initial design stage of a new car, designers need a lot of information about stress distribution, vibrational and thermal problems, interaction between engine and acoustic cavity, internal and external aerodynamic behav- iors. This information must be available during the early pre-engineering phase to allow the design of optimized prototypes. A quick answer and clear result of presen- tation are very important elements that make it possible for the designer to act quickly and without any doubt. To reach this goal, it is essential to use specialized pre- and post-processors which check and interpret input and output data for Finite Element Method program systems. This paper shows the results obtained from several FEM analyses where the results of presentation were done using a 3D interactive graphics system. 790999. (P-83) Interactive Data and Graphic Display Processors for MSAP. Movses J. Kaldjian, Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. A computer program called PREMSAP to prepare input data for structural analysis and design of structures (including car frames and parts), along with a program called MSAPLOT to display graphically the mathematical models, have been developed for the University of Michigan Structural Analysis Program MSAP. The latter is based on SAP IV and has the same input format. PREMSAP is a format free interactive program with quadrilateral and linear, nodal point and element mesh generation options for preparing the input data for MSAP for static and dynamic loads. Using the PREMSAP output, or otherwise prepared MSAP data, MSAPLOT plots line, plane and 3-D objects in isometric, perspective and hidden line forms. It also allows the user of MSAP to view the deformed structure due to static loads or dynamic mode analyses, produce ink drawings through the CalComp plotter, and draw stress contours for membrane and eight-node brick elements. Use of PREMSAP and MSAPLOT programs has been proved very successful by consultants, researchers, and students alike. 791002. (P-82) Protection of Occupants of Commercial Vehicles by Integrated Seat/Beit Systems. Gert Rüter and Heinrich Hontschik, Battelle - Insti- tut e.V., Frankfurt am Main, Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the larger manipulation distances and the frequently installed vibration-absorbing seats (with extra vibration damping), restraint systems in commercial vehicles must meet other requirements than those in passenger cars; it was found that integrated seat/belt systems (belt anchorage incorporated in the seat) are required. Five different types of integrated seat/belt systems were evaluated in frontal crash experiments at an impact speed of 35 km/h, using dummies in a truck cab on the catapult unit. The results were compared with those obtained with conventional three-point belts and with unrestrained dummies. The experimental results showed that when the dummy was unrestrained or protected only by a lap belt (even if integrated) the upper load limits used as protection criteria were far exceeded because of the heavy impact on the steering wheel; this did not apply to three-point belt systems. Very favourable forward dis- placement kinematics were achieved when using special seats of adequate structural strength with integrated three-point belt systems; in this case the load on the occupants' bodies lies within acceptable limits, and the occupants do not hit hard against interior parts of the cab. Further, the experiment showed that a vibration- absorbing seat with integrated three-point belt and 146</page><page sequence="130">791003-791006 additional supports fitted to the seat and backrest is the optimum solution. 1979 SA E Transactions 791003.

(P-82) Seat Design - A Significant Factor for Safety Belt Effectiveness. Dieter Adomeit, Insti- tute for Automotive Engineering, Technical University Berlin. Production seats and specially designed research seats were analyzed with respect to seat-safety belt interaction under frontal crash conditions. The objective was to evaluate seat influences on effectiveness of safety belts, or any other restraint system. We determined that classical measurement techniques alone are insufficient to com- pletely cover problems of seat-safety belt interaction. Supplementary evaluation parameters of dummy kine- matics were therefore defined to clarify • the poor safety design of current production seats • necessary seat design development for increased safety. Proposals for possible effective seat design were then derived to satisfy necessary new safety requirements for seating. 1979 SA E Transactions 791005. (P-82) Response of Belt Restrained Subjects in Simulated Lateral Impact. John D. Horsch, Dennis C. Schneider and Charles K. Kroell, Biomedical Science Department, GM Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; and Frank D. Raasch, Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, CA. Far-side lateral impacts were simulated using a Part 572 dummy and human cadavers to compare responses for several belt restraint configurations. Sled tests were conducted having a velocity change of 35 km/hr at a 10 g deceleration level. It was estimated from field data that a 35 km/hr velocity change of the laterally struck vehicle represents about an 80th percentile level for injury- producing lateral collisions. Subjects restrained by a three-point belt system with an outboard anchored diagonal shoulder belt (i.e., positioned over the shoulder opposite the side of impact) rotated out of the shoulder belt and onto the seat. The subject received some lateral restraint due to interaction with the shoulder belt and seatback. The subjects restrained by a three-point belt system with an inboard anchored diagonal shoulder belt (i.e., positioned over the shoulder on the side of impact) remained essentially upright due to shoulder belt interaction with the neck and/or head. Kinematic responses of the Part 572 dummy were generally similar to those of the cadaver subjects. Injuries we found in cadavers restrained by both shoulder belt configurations, but were more extensive to the cervical region for those subjects receiving direct neck and/or head loading from the belt. However, limitations in the cadaver model and test environment, as well as the preliminary nature of the experiments do not permit definitive conclusions on the significance or applicability of the injury data obtained to real accident situations at this time. 1979 SA E Transactions 791006. (P-82) Performance of a Shoulder Belt and Knee Restraint in Barrier Crash Simulations. David C. Viano and Clyde C. Culver, Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Labo- ratories, Warren, MI. Previous pendulum impact tests have shown that knee joint injuries and tibial-fibular fractures may occur when loads are directed against the lower leg rather than directly against the femur in the knee. In order to further improve our understanding of lower extremity restraint mechanics, simulated frontal barrier crash experiments were conducted with unembalmed human cadavers and an anthropomorphic dummy restrained by a two-point shoulder belt. In the first test, an experimental bolster was specifically positioned so that the cadaver's lower leg would strike the bolster, thus inducing restraining loads entirely below the knee joint. The analysis of occupant kinematics showed that the flexed knee rode over and forward of the low-positioned bolster. Restraint induced considerable shearing load across the knee joint. Bolster measurements indicated a peak load of approximately 4.0 kN per leg which resulted in a contralateral central tear of the posterior cruciate ligaments. Factors influencing the performance of a shoulder belt and knee restraint system were studied in the remaining experiments. Positioning the bolster to provide full knee contact and early femoral loading, and orienting the bolster face to reduce knee joint shear loads (~38.5° from horizontal) were identified as important parameters for improved performance of the knee restraint in these tests. The reaction force vector of the deforming bolster structure (~32.5° from horizontal) represented an addi- tional independent factor in minimizing contact loads and 147</page><page sequence="131">791007-791010 in controlling occupant kinematics. Under these knee restraint conditions, an average peak bolster reaction force of 6.2 kN per leg (compared with a dummy femur load of 5.9 kN) did not result in injury to the lower extremity of four cadavers. The experiments indicated that a two-point shoulder belt and knee restraint system can control occupant kinematics and attenuate potential lower extremity injury during a 13.4 m/s frontal crash simulation. 1979 SA E Transactions 791007. (P-82) Simulation of Side Impact Using the CAL3D Occupant Simulation Model. Arvind J. Padgaonkar and Priyaranjan Prasad, Ford Mo- tor Companyģ By applying some advanced features of the CAL3D occupant simulation model, a single model incorporating the vehicle structure and a simplified occupant was developed for studying the sensitivity of occupant re- sponse to parameter changes in perpendicular, vehicle- to-vehicle side impacts, not involving vehicle rotation. The results of the model show qualitative agreement with published experimental results, which indicate that oc- cupant responses are related to the initial clearance of the occupant from the door, the stiffnesses of the front end of the impacting vehicle, and the side structure of the impacted vehicle. 791008. (P-82) Injuries to Pedestrians in Real Accidents and Their Relation to Collision and Car Char- acteristics. Maximilian Danner, Klaus Langwieder and Wilhelm Wächter, Department of Automotive Engineering, Association of German Automobile Insurers (HUK- Verband). Protection of pedestrians in car collisions is now an important aim of accident research. However, only few results deal with real world pedestrian accidents and the consequences of injury. In this paper results with regard to accident and injury characteristics of pedestrian are presented on a basis of 3000 real world accidents. Location and intensity of pedestrian primary impact on the car is stated. Head and leg injuries are predominant pedestrian injuries. The influence of pedestrian age was clearly confirmed. Elderly adults sustain more fractures of lower limb, pelvis and upper thigh. Children reveal a high incidence of head, torso and upper thigh injuries due to their relative height. In fact that about 20% of the injured pedestrians are children only between 6 and 9 years of age, safety requirements of children should be included to a higher degree in the optimization of the car front end. Typical influence of car form on injury incidence was found. Pedestrian overall injury severity was about balanced with some advantage for the "v" form as compared to the "pontoon" form. Typical differences exist with regard to individual body areas. Lower limb injuries are overrepresented with the "v" form; "pontoon" form cars have a higher incidence of abdominal and upper thigh injuries. Serious/fatal head injuries were found to have equal frequency with both car forms. In spite of the remaining risks of road contact, pedestrian safety in car collisions can be positively influenced by measures of vehicle technology and by optimization of car front structures. 1979 SA E Transactions 791009. (P-82) Comparison of Passenger Injuries in Frontal Car Collisions with Dummy Loadings in Equivalent Simulations. Klaus Langwieder, Maximilian Danner and Walter Schmelzing, Department of Automotive Engineering, Asso- ciation of German Automobile Insurers (HUK- Verband); and Hermann Appel, Florian Kramer and Jens Hofmann, Technical University of Berlin, Institute of Automotive Engineering. A method is presented which correlates injuries in real accidents with Dummy Loadings. This procedure was applied to frontal car/car collisions with 318 occupants wearing safety belts. Dummy Loadings on head, chest and pelvis are confronted with real injury severity in the sub-critical injury level and maximum tolerance limits are deduced. The Dummy Loading curves are worked out by means of a comprehensive calculating simulation. The calculation programs applied were calibrated with crash tests and sled runs. The connection between simulation and real acci- dents is formed by an Equivalent Accident Characteristic for the defining of the accident severity; the velocity change A v has proved to be practicable and reliable for the frontal collisions analysed here. Both results of simulation and accident analysis are related to the reference factor "A v". By elimination of the accident characteristic A v direct relation between real injury and Dummy Loading was established. Corresponding Dummy Loadings for subcriticai AIS- values are given. The tolerance limit for fatal head injuries was found at about HIC = 1600 and therefore is higher than it is assumed up to the present time. The tolerance limit of the chest of SI = 1000 has been confirmed. For pelvis/abdominal injuries the tolerance limit resulted in a value of 74 g. Possibilities for further research works are indicated. The method will be modified also for side collisions and total Dummy Load index in the subcriticai area in later reports. 1979 SA E Transactions 791010. (P-82) Influence of Mass Ratio and Structural Compatibility on the Severity of Injuries Sus- tained by the Near Side Occupants in Car-to-Car Side Collisions. F. Hartemann, J. Y. Foret- Bruno, C. Thomas and C. Tarrière, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique de l'Asso- ciation, Peugeot-Renault, La Garenne- 148</page><page sequence="132">791012-791016 Colombes (France); C. Got and A. Patel, IRO/IRBA, Hôpital Raymond Poincaré, Garches (France). In 1344 car-to-car side collisions, the risk of serious or fatal injury to the occupants of struck vehicles seem to increase proportionally to the difference in mass ratios in favor of the striking vehicle. However, in-depth analysis of 63 collisions during which the impact occurred on the side panel of the passenger compartment reveals that the difference in mass ratios is not the principal determinant of injury severity. The frequency and severity of injuries correlates better with the amount of intrusion of the side panel, a type of intrusion which occurs almost systematically, and even at low impact speed, when the bumper and structure in front of the side rail of the striking car override the rocker panel of the struck car. We shall show the relationship between the severity of chest, abdominal and pelvic injuries sustained by occu- pants seated perpendicularly to the intruding panel and the following parameters: - mass ratio - compatibility of the relative heights of the stiffest elements involved in the impact - impact speed - A v of the struck car - intrusion We shall indicate the structural modifications which might improve protection of occupants involved in side collision with another car. 1979 SA E Transactions 791012. (P-82) Femoral Loads Measured by a Six-Axis Load Cell. R. Cheng, R. A. Denton and A. I. King, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. A six-axis femoral load cell was designed, fabricated, calibrated and tested in an ATD upper leg. It has linear characteristics with adequate output and dynamic re- sponse. Its output compared well with that of load cells mounted behind a knee bolster which was impacted by an ATD instrumented with this load cell. Although the axial load was found to be well below the present limit of FMVSS208, the bending moments were found to be high. A conservative tolerance limit for axial load should be considered and cadaver data are required. 1979 SA E Transactions 791013. (P-82) Epidemiology of Childhood Motor Vehicle Related Accidents. Robert G. Scherz, Mary Bridge Children's Health Center. Motor vehicle related accidents are a highly significant cause of injury and death of children in industrialized countries throughout the world. In 1977 in the United States alone, there were 4,700 motor vehicle related deaths and over 180,000 disabling injuries of children from birth to age 14 years. Careful analysis of those factors which contribute to the morbidity and mortality rates and establishment of counteracting programs to reduce the destructive effects of these factors offers hope for the future. 791014. (P-82) Car Seat Safety - Past, Present, and Future. Richard E. Hyde, "Strolee" of Cali- fornia. Much has been written concerning the technical aspects of child car seat testing. Since the early 1970's there has been a steady increase in the amount and quality of the test data. The purpose of this article is not to review the progress of child seat development from the purely technical viewpoint, but to describe the development of a philos- ophy concerning the "total performance" of a child seat for use in automobiles. In developing this philosophy it has been necessary to blend technical requirements with marketing needs and to satisfy the personal needs of both parent and infant. 791015. (P-82) NHTSA Child Safety Activities. R. Rhoads Stephenson, U.S. Department of Trans- portation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 1978, about 4,200 children died in motor vehicle accidents. Exclusive of early childhood diseases, ap- proximately 16 percent of the child fatalities, ages 0-14, are the result of such accidents. The unrestrained child in a passenger car becomes a missile during a crash, projected to any part of the occupant area, and ejection from the vehicle is a major cause of death. Restraints for various age groups of children, such as belts and child seats are discussed, and dynamic tests with anthropomorphic dummies are de- scribed in this paper. Plans for additional restraint studies and biomedical research are described. Proposals have been made to revise the child restraint standard (FMVSS 213) to extend the scope to include infant carriers and harnesses in addition to child seats, and to require dynamic testing. Promising results have been obtained with vehicle soft front ends which are more forgiving to pedestrians. Public information programs to increase restraint usage by children are presented along with a discussion of behavioral countermeasures dealing with the pedestrian and bicyclist/motor vehicle accidents. 791016. (P-82) Some Factors Influencing the Injuries Sustained by Child Pedestrians Struck by the Fronts of Cars. S. J. Ashton, Accident Research Unit, Department of Transportation and En- vironmental Planning, University of Birmingham (England)ģ The relative importance of child pedestrian accidents is first considered by reference to national accident statistics for Great Britain. Data from a study using existing hospital and police records are then used to examine the 149</page><page sequence="133">791017-791019 location of the initial pedestrian contacts with the vehicle and the effects of initial contact on overall injury severity. In particular the incidence of 'run over' accidents is examined and it is shown that, contrary to popular belief, the very young child is rarely run over by the striking vehicle. The injuries sustained by child pedestrians struck by the fronts of cars or light goods vehicles derived from a car are then described and the differences in injury patterns with age examined. The effects of vehicle front end height on the injuries sustained are considered and it is shown that when the front end height is 0.6-0.7 pedestrian height there is an increased risk of neck injury compared to other relative front end heights. 1979 SA E Transactions 791017. (P-82) Child Restraint Evaluation by Experi- mental and Mathematical Simulation. J. Wismans and J. Maltha, Research Institute for Road Vehicles, TNO-Delft (Holland); J. W. Melvin and R. L. Stalnaker, Biomechanics Department, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. Two child restraint system sled tests with a child cadaver and a 3-year-old child dummy have been carried out at the Highway Safety Research Institute of The University of Michigan. Some differences between the kinematical response of dummy and cadaver were found. Two mathematical models have been formulated, using the MADYMO program package, for the special purpose of evaluating child restraint performance. A description of the validated dummy and cadaver model is presented together with a comparison of experimental and model results. A sensitivity study was conducted to have a better insight into the effects of various parameters on the child's response. To show the use of the model as a design tool, a simulation with an energy absorbing backstrap is pre- sented. It is concluded that the mathematical model is a better simulation for the cadaver kinematics than the dummy. 1979 SA E Transactions 791018. (P-82) Development of Testing and Evaluation of Child Restraint Systems and Child Test Dummies by NHTSA. Vladislav G. Radovich and Antho- ny R. Bayer, U.S. Department of Transporta- tion, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration; Joseph B. Benson, HSRI, University of Michigan; and Kenneth N. Naab, Calspan Advanced Technology Center. An extensive program was undertaken by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to establish appropriate means and procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of child restraints in automobile crashes. This was an extension of an earlier program which involved testing of commercially available three and six-year-old child test dummies. A three-year-old child test dummy (produced by Alderson Research Laboratory) was found to provide acceptable acceleration and kinematic measurements and this model was further tested and evaluated. Static and dynamic tests were developed to calibrate the test dummy, which would assure the uniformity of construction from sample to sample, and produce the uniformity of measurements in crash testing. The cali- bration involved the measurement of head and chest accelerations and the bending characteristics of the neck and lumbar section. Tests were conducted with four dummies at two laboratories to account for any differ- ences in the measured responses due to differences in the dummies, in testing procedures, in equipment, and in data reduction. Four calibrated dummies were further evaluated in simulated frontal crashes in two representative child restraint-automobile crash environments to determine the repeatability of their responses obtained in replicated testing. Six repeated tests were made with each dummy at 30 mph impacts with the "GM Love Seat" representing the belt type and with the Chrysler "Mopar" seat representing the shield type restraint. Also, three repeated tests were made with each dummy at 20 mph with the "GM Love Seat" top tether straps disconnected. All four dummies gave repeatable measurements of the head and chest accelerations and head and knee excursions and were sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in the crash environments. Twenty-three different child restraint systems were tested in 30 mph and 20 mph simulated crashes with infant and three-year-old child test dummies. The results indicate that a number of child restraint systems failed structurally and that the dynamic testing could uncover these and other performance problems. 791019. (P-82) Tests and Materials for School Bus Retrofit Applications. Roger M. Zimmerman, New Mexico State University. The objectives of the experimental study were to inves- tigate methods and materials that might be used to retrofit protective materials for older model school bus seats, modesty panels, and stanchions. Laboratory tests were conducted under FMVSS 222 guidelines on these bus components, under conditions with and without com- mercial retrofit materials, using the head and knee forms. Additional tests were conducted on five potential mate- rials that might be used in retrofit situations. Conclusions from 390 tests were that: (1) The dynamic portions of FMVSS 222 could be applied to older model school buses for retrofit appli- cations. (2) The seat back and modesty panel rails are the most dangerous objects for potential facial injuries. (3) Head concussion injuries do not appear to be a problem. (4) Commercial materials are available that can be 150</page><page sequence="134">791020-791023 used to minimize the facial type injuries. 791020. (P-82) Head Impact Response Comparisons of Human Surrogates. Guy S. Nusholtz, John W. Mel vin and Nabih M. Alem, Biomechanics Department, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. The response of the head to impact in the posterior- to-anterior direction was investigated with live anesthe- tized and post-mortem primates. The purpose of the project was to relate animal test results to previous head impact tests conducted with cadavers (reported at the 21st Stapp Car Crash Conference, and to study the differences between the living and post-mortem state in terms of mechanical response. The three-dimensional motion of the head, during and after impact, was derived from experimental measure- ments and expressed as kinematic quantities in various reference frames. Comparison of kinematic quantities between subjects is normally done by referring the results to a standard anatomical reference frame, or to a predefined laboratory reference frame. This paper uses an additional method for describing the kinematics of head motion through the use of Frenet-Serret frame fields. The experimental technique used a nine-accelerometer system, mounted rigidly to the head, to measure head motions. Additional measurements included impact force, epidural pressure, and strains in the skull bone. High- speed cineradiography (1000 frames/second) was used during the impact. A total of seven animals were tested in the project, five post-mortem and two live. The results of the tests are presented to demonstrate the similarities and differences found between animal and human cadaver subjects and between living and post- mortem subjects. The effects of the following factors are discussed: 1. Relative magnitudes of brain mass, skull mass and external soft tissue mass. 2. Head surface geometry at the impact site and mass distribution. 3. Differences in epidural pressures and in head trajectories. 1979 SA E Transactions 791021. (P-82) The Response of Unembalmed Cadaveric and Living Cerebral Vessels to Graded Injury - A Pilot Study. Randall W. Smith, Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego. This study investigates the propensity for rupture of living and unembalmed cadaveric canine cerebral vessels when subjected to similar injury. A 10 gram mass was dropped from varying heights onto the exposed brain in both the living and cadaveric state. The post-mortem cerebral vessels were reperfused with an ink marker at living pressures to simulate normal vascular distention with blood. Both living and cadaveric vessels ruptured in response to the same energy (100 to 400 cm gm.) and failed to rupture below these levels (50 cm gm.). It is suggested that the physical integrity of post-mortem cerebral vessels is sufficiently adequate to allow them to serve as indicators of brain injury in response to various loads. This vascular injury should be more pertinent to the investigation of traumatic brain injury than the propensity of load to fracture the skull, since the occurrence of skull fracture in trauma is inconsistently related to brain injury. 1979 SA E Transactions 791022. (P-82) Differential Tolerance of Frontal and Temporal Lobes to Contusion Induced by Angu- lar Acceleration. Thomas A. Gennarelli and Jacob M. Abel, University of Pennsylvania; Hume Adams and David Graham, University of Glasgow. Frontal and temporal lobe contusions that were caused by a single sagittal plane angular acceleration impulse were analyzed. At neuropathological exam the depth, extent, and location of contusions were mapped and described according to a classification previously developed for human use. Of 30 rhesus monkeys subjected to a single angular acceleration impulse, 13 had no frontal or temporal contusion (Group 1), 8 had only frontal contusion (Group 2) and 9 had temporal contusions (Group 3). Correlation with angular acceleration, tan- gential acceleration and tangential force showed that the three groups were statistically different. The mean peak positive tangential force for Groups 1-3 was 541, 659 and 766 newtons respectively (p &lt; 0.10). This suggested that as mechanical imput increased, frontal contusions occur before temporal contusions and that the threshold for frontal contusion is less than that for temporal contusion. If this relationship is true, one would predict that if there is sufficient input to cause a temporal contusion then a frontal contusion should also be present. In fact, in Group 3, 8 of the 9 animals with temporal contusion also had frontal contusion. Thus only once did a temporal contusion occur in the absence of frontal contusion. Furthermore, the frontal contusions in Group 3 were statistically more extensive than either the frontal con- tusion of Group 2 or than the temporal contusions of Group 3. These data support the concept that in angular acceleration the threshold for frontal contusions is less than the threshold for temporal contusions. The reasons why this is so could be related either to differences in the mechanical properties of the tissues or to regional differences of the mechanical input. Since the authors feel that the data best support the hypothesis that these contusions result from deceleration contact forces, we favor the latter explanation. 1979 SA E Transactions 791023. (P-82) Acceleration Induced Shear Strains in a Monkey Brain Hemisection. V. R. Hodgson and L. M. Thomas, School of Medicine, Wayne State University. 151</page><page sequence="135">791024-791028 A freshly dead Stumptail ( Macaca speciosa) monkey brain hemisection model has been subjected to translation, pure rotation and a combination motion. Linear and angular head accelerations were measured as well as brain displacement relative to the skull and shear strain at several locations. Much higher than previously predicted shear strain was measured at acceleration levels which have been recorded during impacts which produced concussion in live monkeys. Pure rotation produced the highest, most diffuse and long lasting shear strain and brain displacement, while translation produced very low shear strain. Highest shear strain during rotation was recorded in the brainstem rather than on the periphery as many have predicted. Results suggest that the mechanism of brainstem injury, regardless of head motion, is due to shear caused by stretching of the cervical cord. 1979 SA E Transactions 791024. (P-82) Intracranial Pressure Relationships in the Protected and Unprotected Head. Alan M. Nahum, Randall Smith and Frank Raasch, University Hospital, University of California, San Diego; and Carley Ward, Civil Engineering Laboratory, Naval Const. Batt. Center, Port Hueneme, CA. This paper represents a continuation of previous research on closed head impact in the human cadaver and an associated mathematical model. The long term goal of the study is to describe the relationships between head impact events which might be useful in understanding what takes place in the living human. In the current study, two different sets of experiments were conducted, 1) sequential impacts on a single embalmed helmeted specimen and 2) impact experiments on individual helmeted unembalmed specimens. Impact parameters and intracranial pressures were measured and discussed. A finite element model is presented which can predict the intracranial pressures throughout the brain for the first 8 msec. It is apparent that the helmet prevents high magnitude, short duration intracranial pressures and that posterior pressures develop after the acceleration phase and helmeted impacts. 1979 SA E Transactions 791025. (P-82) Further Validation of the Simulation Model of Automobile Collisions Program. Ian S. Jones and A. Stephen Baum, Advanced Tech- nology Center, Calspan Corporation. To improve the utility of the SM AC program and to assess its limitations, twelve vehicle-to-vehicle collisions were staged and then reconstructed with the program. A variety of impact configurations were run including: 60° front- to-side, 90° front-to-side, 10° offset head-on and 10° offset rear-end. The reconstruction of each test is discussed and compared with the measured data, using the final rest positions, velocity changes, and damage profiles of each vehicle. Finally, the limitations of the SMAC program together with recommendations for improving the simu- lation model are outlined. 791026. (P-82) A Comparison Between Part 572 Dummy and Human Subject in the Problem of Sub- marining. Y. C. Leung, C. Tarrière, A. Fay on and P. Mairesse, Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics, Peugeot-Renault Association; A. Delmas, Laboratory of Anatomy, U.E.R. Saints Pères-Paris (France); and P. Banzet, Hôpital Saint Louis-Paris (France). Anthropometric data relative to the pelvis have been obtained from X-rays of volunteers and Part 572 dummy, as well as pelvic bones of 28 human skeletons. Conse- quently, modifications in the pelvic portion of Part 572 dummy are proposed. These are based on the study in the difference of tendency to submarining, the difference of the pelvic shape, and the abdominal flexibility between Part 572 dummy and the human being. Some submarining parameters are discussed using the experimental results. A method for establishing the criteria of abdominal injuries caused by submarining is also described. 1979 SA E Transactions 791027. (P-82) Biodynamics of the Living Human Spine During -Gx Impact Acceleration. R. Cheng, N. K. Mitai, R. S. Levine and A. I. King, Bio- engineering Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. Spinal kinematics of the living human volunteers under- going -Gx impact acceleration are described along with the experimental procedures followed to acquire such data. There were 4 male and 3 female volunteers who were subjected to impacts in the tensed and relaxed mode from 2-8 g, in 1-g increments. Their lower extremities were tightly clamped to the impact seat and the pelvis was restrained by a lapbelt. The biodynamic response of the living spine is quite similar to that of the cadaveric spine, particularly in terms of T1 displacement, acceleration at T1 and flexural resistance. Female volunteers tend to withdraw from the test program at lower g-levels than males due to transient neck pain. 1979 SA E Transactions 791028. (P-82) Postural Influences on Thoracic Impact. Mary E. Pope, Charles K. Kroell and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; Charles Y. Warner and Stanley D. Allen, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. The influence of body posture, and inherently support, on thoracic impact response was investigated in an animal model. Anesthetized and postmortem domestic swine were exposed to blunt, midsternal loading while supported in their natural quadrupedal posture, and the results were compared with previously reported data from similar tests 152</page><page sequence="136">791029-791032 involving an upright body orientation. Twelve male animals were tested, six while anesthetized and six postmortem. Each animal was impacted once by a 21 kg rigid mass with a flat contact interface moving at a nominal velocity of either 8 or 10 m/s. Measured mechanical responses included applied load, sternal and spinal accelerations, thoracic compression and aortic overpressure. Injury response was assessed from a thoracico-abdominal necropsy. In addition, ECG traces were recorded pre and postimpact to monitor electro- physiological response. A comparison of results indicates generally higher forces and sternal accelerations and markedly different injury profiles and cardiac arrhythmias for subjects tested in the quadrupedal rather than upright orientation. The anesthetized animals suspended in their natural posture sustained serious pulmonary hemorrhage without skeletal damage, whereas the upright-suspended subjects suffered multiple rib fractures and instances of liver laceration. ECG changes occurred in both postures, although these were generally of minor severity for the quadrupedal orientation. Ventricular fibrillation did not occur in any natural posture test despite peak sternal accelerations up to 1300 g's, but occurred in all upright posture tests with peak sternal accelerations exceeding 700 g's. In this preliminary study pretest body posture and support appeared to have a significant influence on impact responses, injuries, and electrocardiographic changes. 1979 SA E Transactions 791029. (P-82) A Study of Driver Interactions with an Inflating Air Cushion. John D. Horsch and Clyde C. Culver, Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Conceptually, a steering wheel mounted air cushion is inflated before the upper torso of the driver significantly interacts with the cushion. However, this might not be the case for some seating postures or vehicle crash envi- ronments which could cause the driver to significantly interact with an inflating cushion. These experiments utilized several environments to study the interaction between an inflating driver air cushion and mechanical surrogates. In these laboratory environments, the measured responses of mechanical surrogates increased with diminishing distance between the surrogate's sternum and the steering wheel mounted air cushion. 791030. (P-82) A 30 mph Front/Rear Crash with Human Test Persons. R. Wagner, Audi-NSU Auto Union AG. A great deal of data is available concerning accident simulation tests with test dummies or cadavers but in comparison there is very little material on tests involving living volunteers. This paper describes crash tests and sled tests with human test persons and Hybrid II dummies. To obtain a realistic accident simulation the tests were run with standard Audi 80 vehicles fitted with the standard seat belt systems. The results clearly demonstrate that none of the test persons sustain any kind of physical injury at a precisely defined level of accident severity (vehicle-to-vehicle crash at a collision speed of approx. 30 mph). In some cases considerable differences are revealed between the loadings imposed on the dummies and the human test persons. 1979 SA E Transactions 791031. (P-82) Modification of Part 572 Dummy for Lateral Impact According to Biomechanical Data. R. L. Stalnaker, C. Tarrière, A. Fayon, G. Walfisch, M. Balthazard and J. Masset, Labo- ratory of Physiology and Biomechanics, Peugeot-Renault Association; C. Got and A. Patel, Institute of Orthopaedical Research, Raymond Poincaré Hospital. This study is related to the modifications of Part 572 dummy for lateral impact, to aid in the evaluation of the injury reducing potential of automotive lateral protection systems. This was done by modifying the rib cage, arms and shoulders of Part 572 so that its impact performance more closely simulates that of a human. According to biomechanical data coming from ca- daver testing, the arm was modified by reducing the size of the structural members and increasing the padding of the arm; the mobility of the shoulder was increased in both forward and upward directions. Moreover, the shoulder was modified to become transversely collapsible to a certain extent. The rib cage was redesigned so as to give a more realistic deformation. The measurement of lateral chest deflection was also incorporated into the rib cage design. The frontal impact characteristics of the dummy, both for impact and belts, were left unchanged. The result of these modifications were compared with freefall and full scale crash tests with cadavers, both in frontal and lateral impacts. The results of these compar- isons are given. 1979 SA E Transactions 791032. (P-82) Evaluation of Human Tolerance in Frontal Impacts. D. Césaři and M. Ramet, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière (France). In this paper are analysed the results of ten accident reconstructions of 5 frontal actual car traffic accidents. These accidents involved 9 restrained occupants, and were reconstructed first with 50th percentile dummies and then with human cadavers. The results of these reconstructions are analysed in order to compare the injuries sustained in real accident first, with the injury criteria values recorded on dummies, and second with injuries and injury criteria values found 153</page><page sequence="137">791033-791041 on cadavers. The results show that an AIS 3 head injury in actual accident could correspond to a low value of HIC recorded on dummy, that there is a large scatter in chest injury criteria related to chest injuries, and that if we need a protection for almost all occupants in frontal impact, we have to choose chest injury criteria value lower than the proposed one. 1979 SA E Transactions 791033. Cumulative Damage Approach to Durability Route Design. K. V. Smith and R. F. Stornant, Truck and Recreation Products Operations, Ford Motor Company. This paper describes the procedure used to design a stable concrete replacement for a gravel durability test road. The replacement road was designed analytically to match the cumulative fatigue damage of the gravel road and consisted of individual test events that existed on various vehicle proving grounds. Although this paper deals specifically with road replacement, the method could easily be adapted to road comparison, i.e. proving ground to proving ground or customer to proving ground. 1979 SA E Transactions 791034. A Field Performance Prediction Technique for Light Truck Structural Components. R. S. Beamgard, K. P. Snodgrass and R. F. Stornant, Truck and Recreation Products Operations, Ford Motor Company. A method has been developed which allows prediction of the field performance of structural components based on prototype vehicle test procedures and results. Component designs can then be optimized by selecting prototype durability test objectives which more accurately reflect actual field usage. This procedure, which is based on fatigue damage calculations from component strain histories, has been successfully applied to nonsafety related body, frame and suspension structural components of light trucks and vans. 1979 SA E Transactions 791035. Evolution of the New Ford Light Truck Four Wheel Drive Independent Front Suspension. G. S. Bedi and W. H. R. Lake, Truck and Recre- ation Products Operations, Ford Motor Com- pany. A new Twin Traction Beam, independent front suspen- sion system, for 1980 model Ford light duty 4x4 trucks, has been designed, developed and is in U.S. domestic production by Ford Motor Company. The unique Twin Traction Beam suspension was designed around the proven Twin-I-Beam independent front suspension concept, which has been used on conventional two-wheel drive Ford light duty trucks since 1965. The new suspension system was designed to be packaged in Ford's new 1980 F-Series light duty models, and to meet the objectives of: improved fuel economy, ride, handling and performance, while still retaining all the toughness associated with Ford's previous four-wheel drive models, which utilized the more common mono- beam suspension. This paper describes the objectives, evolution of design, development, testing, and manufacturing and assembly chronology of the newest suspension system from Ford. 1979 SA E Transactions 791037. Hybrid Graphite Fiber Composites for the Au- tomotive Industry. S. L. Cross, Hercules Inc. This paper summarizes the status of hybrid graphite fiber composites as related to the automotive industry. Included are: (1) basic raw material forms available for use in hybrid construction, (2) relative tensile properties of unidirectional composites as compared with hybrid forms being developed, (3) some example applications, with emphasis on raw materials and construction, and (4) projected economics for the potential use of hybrid materials. Over the past several years, raw material suppliers have concentrated on developing material forms suitable for high-volume manufacture of automotive parts. Emphasis has been on the more economical hybrid construction. In general, hybrid graphite construction includes between 5 and 25% graphite reinforcement, with the balance being fiberglass and resin. Future economics based on projected escalation curves look favorable for hybrid graphite composites as a result of anticipated reduced fiber prices. 1979 SA E Transactions 791039. Design, Fabrication, and Evaluation of Experi- mental Advanced Composite Truck Frame Rails. Gerald L. May, General Motors, Truck &amp; Coach Div.; and Curtis Tanner, Convair Div. of General Dynamics. A heavy truck advanced composite frame rail design was developed by General Dynamics Convair Division for General Motors Truck and Coach Division. Design criteria required the composite rail have the same stiffness and strength as the production steel rail. The resulting 5.8m long graphite and Kevlar reinforced epoxy rail weighs 43.2 kg, compared with 1 13.4 kg for the steel rail, a 62 percent saving. This paper discusses the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of two prototype frame rails. Several potential high volume production techniques are briefly discussed. 1979 SA E Transactions 791041. Straight Air Disc Brakes. P. J. Soltis, Kelsey- Hayes Co., Romulus, MI. Because of performance, installation and maintenance advantages of air disc brakes, they have been used as 154</page><page sequence="138">791042-791057 optional equipment by some of the OEM truck and trailer manufacturers. In addition to the above options, air disc brakes are standard equipment on all Mack Fire Truck Axles. This brake is the result of development and fleet testing combined with experiences from a heavy duty truck air over hydraulic disc brake produced by Kelsey- Hayes since 1975. The most unique feature of the brake is the actuating and automatic adjuster mechanisms integrally sealed in the disc brake caliper housing. This paper describes the major features of the design and the development during the laboratory and vehicle tests. 791042. The Effect of Vehicle Design on Post Blowout Controllability. J. E. Bernard, Michigan State Univ.; and C. G. Shapley, Consulting Auto- mobile Engineer. Post-blowout truck control is not yet well understood. This paper analyzes the contribution of two important design parameters, the wheelbase and the steering com- pliance. The analysis indicates that the severity of both the transient and the steady state control problem increases with steering compliance and decreases with wheelbase. 791043. Tire Parameter Effects on Truck Fuel Economy. R. E. Knight, Radial Truck Tire Engrg., The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Akron, OH. Tests were performed with tractor- trailers on a 13- kilometer track to determine effects of tire parameters on fuel economy. Radial tires gave up to nine percent advantage over bias tires when used in all wheel positions of a fully loaded truck. Using radial rather than bias tires on the trailer only provided the largest fuel economy gain of any axle position. Radial tire tread compound affected gains over bias tires significantly. Laboratory tire rolling resistance data provided a ranking of tread compounds that agreed with the fuel economy test. Track surface roughness was a factor in evaluating test results. 1979 SA E Transactions 791044. Expanded Applications Wide Base Radial Truck Tire. William L. Giles, Ruan Transport Corp. North American highway use of the single wide base radial truck tire for other than extra heavy-duty front axle applications warrants greater exploration. Studies of the tire specification indicates opportunity to reduce cost and weight on present wheels plus greater possible savings by redesigning the commercial vehicle wheel into an integral rim, wheel, and hub. Initial limited testing on tractor and trailer applications shows improved fuel mileage, ride, handling, and braking while reducing tire cost and increasing payloads. The improvement in tire wear and vehicle handling while braking may be due in part to the improved tire mating with the rutted surface contour of our worn highways. 1979 SA E Transactions 791046. Evaluation of the Braking Performance of a Tractor-Semitrailer Equipped with Two Different Types of Anti-Lock Systems. C. P. Lam, R. R. Guntur and J. Y. Wong, Transport Technology Research Lab, Dept. of Mechanical and Aero- nautical Engrg., Carleton Univ. (Ottawa/Can- ada). In this paper, a digital computer model for studying the braking performance of an articulated vehicle equipped with anti-lock devices is presented. Using this computer model, the braking characteristics of a tractor-semitrailer fitted with a commercially available system (System A) is compared with that of the same vehicle equipped with a proposed system (system B). The deficiencies of system A are identified. The merits and disadvantages of system B are also examined. Based on the results of the simulation study, guiding principles for the development of the control logic of anti-lock brake systems are suggested. 1979 SA E Transactions 791054.

(P-85) High-Efficiency Hydraulic Power Trans- fer Units for Multisystem Aircraft. W. E. Boehringer, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, California. Many contemporary aircraft requiring multiple hydraulic systems for power redundancy have utilized hydraulic power transfer units to provide that service. These units, which are commonly called reversible motor pumps (RMPs), have been heavy, noisy and inefficient with generally very poor differential pressure startup char- acteristics. A new-generation RMP that has solved many of these problems has been developed for the Douglas DC-9 Super 80 Series aircraft. The new unit emits significantly less noise than existing comparable units and is both weight- and cost-competitive, with excellent startup and running characteristics. It will provide an excellent means of attaining pumping redundancy in future hydraulic system configurations. 791057. (P-85) "Quiet Please". Stanley J. Skaistis, Sperry Vickers, Troy, MI.

(P-85) Developments in Boundary Layer Thrust Vector Control. R. E. Fitzgerald and R. F. Kampe, Chandler Evans Inc., Div. of Colt Industries. Boundary layer thrust vector control (BLTVC) of rocket and gas turbine motors is discussed. BLTVC uses ambient air to vector primary flow in an overexpanded nozzle, producing 2-3 times conventional secondary injection deflection angles. Low cost and reliability result from the absence of a secondary flow storage/injection system, and no moving hardware in contact with hot gas. 50 static hot tests ranging from 2-20,000 pounds thrust and wind tunnel tests to M =1.2 and a = 60° have verified the design for flight application. Among the applications discussed are a high efficiency nozzleless RPV booster /TVC combina- tion, small missile reaction steering with 90° flow turning, and RPV gas turbine exhaust diverters. 791061. Automated Design Using Numerical Optim- ization. Garret N. Vanderplaats, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. Numerical optimization concepts are described with limited technical detail. The purpose is to provide the nonspecialist with sufficient information to judge the applicability of these methods to his particular design problem. The concepts are first described in physical terms to give a basic understanding of the iterative procedure employed by these methods. Next, the typical engineering task is presented and converted to a form ammenable to solution by numerical optimization. Basic algorithms for solving this problem are identified. Nu- merous applications are referenced, emphasizing the structural design discipline. The state of the art allows for the routine solution of nonlinear design problems of approximately 20 independent variables subject to 100 or more constraints. In many applications, much larger design problems may be solved. Selected references are provided which describe the methods and applications in more detail. 1979 SA E Transactions 791064. Vibrating Spatially Periodic Structures with Simply Supported and Guided Ends. P. H. Denke, Douglas Aircraft Co., Long Beach, CA. A spatially periodic structure is a longitudinal array of identical substructures. A method of free and forced vibration analysis of periodic structures with simply supported and guided ends is presented. The compu- tational effort required roughly equals the effort to analyze a single substructure. All natural modes and frequencies of an extensive structure can be found from a characteristic equation of order equal to the degrees of freedom on one substructure boundary. A modal reduc- tion further simplifies the computations; applications are presented. The method is expected to be useful in structural vibration, sound transmission, and sonic fatigue analysis. 1979 SA E Transactions 791067.

The purpose of this paper is to examine recent innovations in the state-of-the-art of aircraft constant speed drive alternating current electric power generation systems. An engineering problem was posed by the concepts used in designing the latest generation of commercial aircraft. The approach to solving the problem and the solutions chosen have offered the opportunity to further increase the reliability of the aircraft secondary power system. The maintenance required has been decreased by simplifying the system, and much of the error potential involved in fault isolation has been eliminated by a reliable Built-in Test (BITE) system. 791068.

Modern transport airplanes use precooled engine bleed air as a source for cabin pressurization, air conditioning, engine cowl and wing deicing, cross-engine starting, air-driven hydraulic pumps and other pneumatic demands. The Boeing Model 767 airplane air supply system consists of separate sets of equipment for each of the airplane's two engines and a remotely located built-in-test equipment (BITE) module. Each set of equipment independently regulates the pressure and temperature of the extracted engine bleed air. The normal control functions are completely pneumatic, not relying on electrical signals or interconnecting wires to provide their control or protective features. Electrical signals are used only for failure conditions using latching-type shutoff solenoids and for the BITE provisions. The digital BITE module monitors inputs from dedicated BITE elements throughout the system on a time-shared basis to isolate 95% of all failures to the LRU (line replaceable unit) level. 1979 SA E Transactions 791069. Development and Flight Test of a Two-Place Night/ Adverse Weather A-10 for the Close-Air Support and Battlefield Attack Mission. John M. Williamson and Wendell Shawler, Fairchild Republic Co. Recognizing a critical void in battlefield support tactical air capability in night and adverse weather, a Fairchild sponsored activity was undertaken to develop, build and critically evaluate a near term, cost-effective solution consisting of an enhancement of the highly effective A-10 156</page><page sequence="140">791070-791082 system. The objective was to incorporate an effective integration of proven avionics with appropriate displays and presentations into a modified A- 10, and to demon- strate night/adverse weather tactical effectiveness using this system to exploit the A-10's tactics and munitions. The N/AW A- 10 has been demonstrated to be a formidable and viable night-low level penetrator with outstanding lethality. 791070. AV-8B A Second Generation V/STOL. John Warakomski, McDonnell Aircraft Co. State-of-the-art technology developments have enabled the enhancement of an operationally proven, superior weapon system to provide next generation capability. Significant advances applicable to vertical and short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft have been made in aerodynamic, propulsion, composite structure and avionics technologies. These have been incorporated into the AV-8B Weapon System, whose performance has been demonstrated through the YAV-8B prototype flight program. 1979 SA E Transactions 791071. Production Eagle and Its Potential. Robert W. White, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The USAF F-15A/B air superiority fighter, built by the McDonnell Aircraft Company and introduced into active service in 1974, has demonstrated exceptional perform- ance and combat readiness. Recent introduction of the F-15C/D with increased internal fuel, provisions for conformai fuel tanks, increased takeoff gross weight plus incorporation of a Radar Programmable Signal Processor provides improvement in range and mission flexibility. These improvements will enhance already demonstrated capabilities for performing other roles, i.e., in-weather strike, defense suppression and real-time reconnaissance in the post 1983 time period at a fraction of the cost to develop a new aircraft. 791074. Experience with a Field Computerized Vibration Analysis System. Paul Ibáñez and Russell B. Spencer, ANCO Engineers, Inc., Santa Monica, CA. Experience with a minicomputer based field-portable vibration analysis system has been gained on several projects including a five story office building, a nuclear power plant containment and internal piping system, and an offshore oil platform. The purpose of the system is to acquire data on up to 64 channels and provide for the organization, documentation, and presentation of the reduced data. Modal parameter identification software is also available. To date the system has proven to be a valuable extension of previous field testing methods. This paper reviews the system's design and its performance in several field tests. 791077. Integrating Mechanical Testing Into The Design and Development Process. Edward L. Peterson, Mechanical Testing and Analysis Area, Struc- tural Dynamics Research Corporation. This paper addresses technical management, coordi- nation, and application of new test technology within mechanical product development and attempts to answer the following questions: • What is the current state-of-the-art approach to design and development of mechanical products? • What techniques and tools are available to enable test engineers to contribute optimally to development programs for new mechanical products? • What actions should a manager take to implement these new test capabilities into his or her company's mechanical product development process? 791079. The Practical Aircraft Hydraulic Test Stand. R. A. Morley, Teledyne Sprague Engrg. In today's aircraft industry the main concern in ground support, without exception, is cost. Regardless of whether you are an equipment specialist in facilities, an equipment designer in engineering, or a manufacturer/vendor of the equipment, the primary concern is to "make it work longer, cheaper." The information presented here deals with an ap- proach to the design of one of the most expensive items of ground support found on a flight line - the portable hydraulic test stand. In addition to cost reduction factors, other related elements will be discussed, such as fluid cleanliness, power requirements, instrumentation, and simplified operations, in an effort to provide the specialist, engineer, or vendor with a starting point. 791081. MCAIR Design Philosophy for Fighter Aircraft Departure and Spin Resistance. John Mello and James Agnew, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, MO. The McDonnell Aircraft Company (MCAIR) design philosophy pertaining to the departure and spin resistance and out-of-control recovery characteristics of fighter aircraft is presented. The more important military spec- ification requirements are reviewed and their influence on this philosophy is discussed. Aerodynamic stability and control criteria and control system design guidelines are presented which are used to assure that a fighter aircraft will exhibit a high level of departure and spin resistance and rapid recovery from out-of-control situations. 791082. Effects of Forebody, Wing and Wing-Body-LEX Flowfields on High Angle of Attack Aerodynam- ics. William A. Moore, Gary E. Erickson, Dale J. Lorincz and Andrew M. Skow, Northrop Aircraft Group. Vortex flows emanating from the forebody and from hybrid wings can have a strong influence on the high angle-of-attack handling qualities and the departure and spin resistance of fighter aircraft. Depending on the 157</page><page sequence="141">791083-791089 strengths, orientation, and breakdown characteristics of these vortices, an aircraft may be departure prone or departure resistant. Northrop has conducted in-depth studies to determine the effect of these shed vortices. Arising from these studies general guidelines have been developed for the design of forebody shapes and hybrid- wing planform shapes such that aircraft stability will be enhanced. 1979 SA E Transactions 791083. Control System Techniques for Improved Depar- ture/Spin Resistance for Fighter Aircraft. Luat T. Nguyen, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. The paper summarizes some fundamental information on control system effects on controllability of highly-ma- neuverable aircraft at high angles of attack and techniques for enhancing fighter aircraft departure/spin resistance using control system design. The discussion includes: (a) a brief review of pertinent high angle-of-attack phenomena including aerodynamics, inertia coupling, and kinematic coupling; (b) effects of conventional stability augmen- tation systems at high-a; (c) high-a control system concepts designed to enhance departure/spin resistance; and (d) the outlook for applications of these concepts to future fighters, particularly those designs which incor- porate relaxed static stability. 1979 SA E Transactions 791085. Hîgh-Angle-of-Attack Flying Qualities - An Overview of Current Design Considerations. Robert K. Heffley and Donald E. Johnston, Systems Technology, Inc. An overview is given on design considerations for high-angle-of-attack flying qualities by examining the perspectives of three groups. These groups include the airframe manufacturers, the research community, and the aircraft users. The research community is exploring a diversity of high-angle-of-attack-related topics. Airplane manufacturers are restricted by cost and time constraints in their ability to use the design tools either now available or being developed. The user-pilots dwell upon factors which the manufacturers and researchers alike find difficult to address, such as provision of suitable sensory cues or the pilots' uneasiness with flight control comput- ers. Taken together, the three points of perspective suggest ways in which the design practices and standards for high angle of attack flying qualities might be enhanced. 791086. HLH and Beyond. Gordon H. Fries and John J. Schneider, Boeing Vertol Company, Philadel- phia, Pennsylvania. Design, fabrication, and test of large high powered helicopter components in the U.S. Army Heavy Lift Helicopter Advanced Technology Component develop- ment program demonstrated the feasibility of efficient, large helicopter components and reduced the risk and cost of future heavy lift helicopter development. The com- ponents included a 92-foot diameter rotor system, an 18,000 horsepower drive system, a fly-by-wire flight control system, a 35 ton cargo handling system, and 8,000 horsepower turbo-shaft engines. Bench testing of the large, high power transmissions was not completed and k required to verify the adequacy of the design modifications resulting from the ATC technology development program. Moreover, current design methods were found to be inadequate for large flight weight gears, and new analytical design methods employing finite element techniques will be required for future large aircraft gear design applications. Extrapolation of the design and manufacturing tech- nologies developed in the ATC program to larger but similar tandem rotor heavy lift configurations indicates that there are no formidable reasons why shaft driven helicopters cannot continue to grow in size. A study comparing shaft driven tandem helicopter configurations with hybrid airship configurations shows the helicopter to be competitive in the logging and containership off- loading applications for which the hybrid airship is being proposed. The present lack of any heavy lift helicopter devel- opment in the U.S. is noted and recommendations made to extend technology development. 791087. Single Rotor Options for Heavy Lift and Poten- tial of Multi Lift. E. S. Carter, D. E. Cooper and L. G. Knapp, Sikorsky Aircraft. After 30 years of continual rotorcraft payload capacity growth, there are strong indications that this trend is leveling off. First, this paper reviews the current state- of-the-art to show that the root of the problem is not any unsurmountable technical barrier and briefly discusses the single rotor options for heavier lift as illustrated by growth derivatives of the CH-53E as well as by the Sikorsky response to the Army HLH proposal. Secondly, it examines the economic factors which appear to have militated, up to this point, against development of larger helicopters for either civil or military requirements. Finally, the paper considers the opportunities to solve the problem of occasional requirements for very heavy lift of single piece payloads by the harnessing of two or more helicopters to a single load - the so called multi-lift concept. The history of Sikorsky studies and flight feasibility demonstrations are reviewed, and the oppor- tunities for applying advanced control technology to offset the pilot workload problems identified in these demonstrations are discussed. 791089. Multi Rotor Options For Heavy Lift. J. DeTore and S. Martin, Jr., Bell Helicopter Textron. This paper reviews some previous and current helicopters designed for heavy lift. Technology status is also reviewed and the problem of arrested development is shown to be in part due to the economics of insufficient utilization. 158</page><page sequence="142">791093-791101 Nevertheless, both military and civil needs are discussed and are projected to grow. A possible resolution of this utilization dilemma is suggested via tri rotor and quad rotor variants of the tilt rotor family of V/STOL aircraft. Multi (greater than two) rotor dynamic systems are projected to weigh less than twin rotor systems and are therefore a way of avoiding rapid design disc loading increases in an attempt to maintain productive vehicle weights. In addition, development risk, investment, and logistic costs are minimized if dynamic components are planned or in use on a smaller aircraft with high production potential. The current paper compares three and four rotor, tilt rotor V/STOL aircraft with an advanced tandem helicopter. All have four engines. The multi rotor V/STOL aircraft use turboshaft engines in the power class of the recent Navy subsonic V/STOL and Maritime Patrol Aircraft studies. Some design consid- erations discussed include: safety, aeroelastic stability, external noise, downwash effects, handling qualities and performance. New capabilities projected include lower- risk dynamic system development, payload-range char- acteristics and mainly, productivity impact. It is shown, for example, that the multi rotor option can service four times the revenue-producing territory (or theater of operations) per day than an advanced tandem helicopter. Recommendations are to pursue configuration research through design studies and analyses, scale model tests of aerodynamic interference, aero-elastic effects and dy- namic load distributions. A potential subscale flight test with four XV- 15 rotors and transmissions is suggested as a simulation of the development concept. 791093. The KC-135 - A Successful Multirole Transport Aircraft. Stephen Starch, Boeing Military Air- plane Company. The Boeing Model 367-80 was the prototype from which grew the 707 and the KC-135. Over 700 KC-135 A models were built during a ten year period. Built as strategic tankers, their mission requirement has broadened to strategic airlift refueling, tactical aircraft refueling, re- connaissance, electronic surveillance, and as airborne command post. Because of its good basic structural and aerodynamic design, systems modernization now under study will allow the -135 to provide a multimission capability for many years. 1979 SA E Transactions 791096. Multirole Cargo Aircraft Options and Configu- rations. D. William Conner and John C. Vaughan, III, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. A future requirements and advanced market evaluation study indicates derivatives of current wide-body aircraft, using 1980 advanced technology, would be economically attractive through 2008, but new dedicated airfreighters incorporating 1990 technology, would offer little or no economic incentive. They would be economically attrac- tive for all payload sizes, however, if RD and T costs could be shared in a joint civil/military arrangement. For the 1994-2008 cargo market, option studies indicate Mach 0.7 propfans would be economically attractive in trip cost, aircraft price and airline ROI. Spanloaders would have an even lower price and higher ROI but would have a relatively high trip cost because of aerodynamic inef- ficiencies. Dedicated airfreighters using propfans at Mach 0.8 cruise, laminar flow control, or cryofuels, would not provide any great economic benefits. Air cushion landing gear configurations are identified as an option for avoiding runway constraints on airport accommodation of very large airfreighters. For all options, significant technology requirements and/or operational constraints are noted. 791097. Future Multi-Mission Transport Aircraft: Re- quirements and Design Possibilities. R. H. Lange and W. T. Mikolowsky, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, GA. Projected mission requirements, the application of ad- vanced technologies, and the use of innovative design concepts will all influence the next generation military transport aircraft. This paper presents our assessment of the trends in future needs for possible civil ánd/or military aircraft and a discussion of three candidate systems developed by Lockheed-Georgia to satisfy these future requirements. The first, a near- term 1985 IOC derivative designated the Lockheed Multi-Role Strategic Aircraft (the LX-MRSA), is a single aircraft configuration offering the flexibility to perform a variety of missions. The baseline configuration is that typical of an outsize military airlifter requiring little change to fill the roles of strategic or tactical airlifter, cruise missile carrier, ICBM carri- er/launcher, aerial tanker, and others. A 1995 IOC advanced-technology large aircraft is presented along with an assessment of desirable design features for a common military/commercial transport as desired in the C-XX concept. Finally, an innovative aircraft design concept, known as Flatbed, is described which has been configured primarily for multi-role operations with a novel backbone fuselage capable of carrying a passenger module, inter- modal containers, or alternatively, outsize vehicles in the open. 791101. Opportunistic Maintenance Policies for Econom- ic Replacement of Internal Life-Limited Com- ponents in Modular Aircraft Engines. John L. Madden, Directorate of Management Sciences, Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. New USAF aircraft engines have modules, each with internal life-limited components. Engines are repaired by replacing modules. Modules are repaired at either base or depot. An opportunistic maintenance policy specifies how early life-limited components may be replaced provided that the engine (or module) is already in repair. A repair 159</page><page sequence="143">791102-791109 level policy specifies when to repair a whole engine at depot instead of at base. Expected long term costs are calculated using computer simulation. Costs are main- tenance manhours, pipeline requirements, shipping, and component replacement. Costs are graphed and the least cost policy choices are identified. 1979 SA E Transactions 791102. On-Condition Maintenance Review of Military Engines. Donald H. Story, Propulsion Man- agement Div., Kelly AFB, TX. The Air Force has adopted the commercial airline's concept of on-condition maintenance. Application to transport aircraft type engines parallels the airline's experience. New generation, modular design, fighter engines have different manpower, facilities and equipment requirements. Engine diagnostics and automated trending and analysis have the potential to enhance maintenance under the on-condition concept. Long term impact of the concept will require continued monitoring and evaluation. 791103. Aerospace Component Repair Procedures. A. Bruce Richter and Ken Eickmann, Propulsion Management Div., San Antonio Air Logistics Center, Air Force Logistics Command. The Air Force is involved in repairing high technology aerospace materials for gas turbine engines. The complex metallurgical and physical property requirements of current aerospace materials place emphasis on adequate inspection and repair procedures of jet engine compo- nents. Many of these components operate at or near the material design constraints and require accurate fore- casting of component life expectancies and careful monitoring of component condition. The large unit cost and extending procurement lead times of these com- ponents leads to development of repair and refurbishment technology to permit salvaging of the items. The need for material performance package will be explored and examples of high technology repair procedures given. 791 105. The Role of Technology in Future Air-To-Surface Systems. Edward L. Warren, Aeromechanics Div., Wright-Patterson AFB. Technology development in the classic sense of im- provements in single discipline performance or function continues to move at a rapid pace. This in itself is not sufficient to get the technologies into advanced systems. A parallel conscious effort is needed to evaluate the technologies in a conceptual system/mission context to develop measures of the technologies worth in terms of end product payoff; i.e., capability improvement of a system with a technology set infused. This serves two purposes; (1) it identifies high payoff technologies, and (2) it helps to establish a potential system's capabilities. The latter can interact with Using Command needs to define specific, realizable system requirements. 791107. An Approach to the Runway Denial Problem. Harold H. Ostroff, McDonnell Aircraft Co., St. Louis, MO. Concern over runway denial weapons has caused con- sideration of VTOL aircraft to replace today's sophis- ticated aircraft for demanding Air Force fighter/attack missions. Short runway operational (SRO) aircraft are proposed as a more timely solution to the Air Force problem. Means for obtaining the required aircraft characteristics, in the near and long term, are discussed, as well as a possible role for Air Force VTOL aircraft. A tool for airbase vulnerability analysis is described. 791108. Fighter Options for Tactical Air Defense. G. R. Kutz, Advanced Air Force Programs, Grumman Aerospace Corporation, Bethpage, NY. Recent and projected trends in the quality and prolifer- ation of the threat - particularly in Europe - focus in- creased attention on the defensive facets of the counterair mission area for future tactical forces. The "overhead" character of air defense and the lopsided numerical advantage of the Warsaw Pact place emphasis on high productivity for future air defense fighters. A recent Grumman/Raytheon study sponsored by the AFFDL examined technology needs for future defensive counter- air aircraft. The arena for that examination was theater air defense of NATO in the 1990's. This paper presents results of that effort with emphasis on the characteristics and technology complements of alternative concepts examined during the study. Five distinctly different weapon system designs emerged as competitive alter- natives. These ranged from a small, low cost, transonic fighter armed with short range, IR guided missiles and deployed in quantity, to a large, sophisticated, and relatively expensive supersonic fighter/interceptor employing long range radar directed missiles. Study conclusions regarding desired capabilities for future air defense fighter alternatives include the identification of specific advanced technologies which have the potential to efficiently provide those capabilities. 1979 SAE Transactions 791109. Reliability and Maintainability Design Standards from Readiness-Related Goals. L. Rogin and J. Gold, Information Spectrum, Inc., Warminster, PA. A set of procedures is identified which permits the determination of Reliability and Maintainability design standards for a Naval aircraft weapon system, in terms of readiness-related operational goals. Generalized relation- ships and specific logic tracks are identified for the principal readiness-related parameters. The procedures are based on assumptions that the systems being designed will exhibit characteristics con- sistent with systems currently in operational use by the Fleet. The anticipated ranges of variation for the principal parameters are established by evaluating Fleetwide av- 160</page><page sequence="144">791111-791200 erages over a wide range of current Naval aircraft systems, considering two reporting periods Fiscal Years 1976 and 1978. 791111. Quantitative Evaluation of Deficiencies (QED) and Deficiency Analysis Ranking Technique (DART). William B. Lindquist, Air Force Test and Evaluation Center. During Air Force test and evaluation of new systems, a considerable number of deficiencies are found in the logistics and operational areas. To determine in what order the deficiencies should be fixed, a disciplined approach for ranking deficiencies was developed. A weighted matrix method was developed to allow both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies to be ranked. The quantitative method used the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM), a Monte Carlo computer simulation, to deter- mine a deficiency's impact on a measure of effectiveness (MOE). The MOE change was then incorporated into the matrix of qualitative deficiencies. The qualitative defi- ciencies were evaluated by a scoring technique based on the judgement of personnel familiar with the deficiency and its possible impact. The method is now being used by the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center (AFTEC) to prioritize system deficiencies. 791200. (EM-1) Materials Availability. This report outlines significant concerns with respect to material availability and lists major sources for additional information. It concentrates on elemental types of materials such as zinc, magnesium, antimony, and includes petroleum and natural rubber. By SAE defi- nition, and for the purposes of this report, the term "automotive" includes any and all vehicles which are self-propelled. However, this initial document concen- trates on materials employed in ground vehicles, encompassing passenger cars, trucks, off-road equipment, and recreational vehicles. It is intended that later documents will cover materials used in aircraft and other vehicles not normally traveling on the ground. 161</page></plain_text>
