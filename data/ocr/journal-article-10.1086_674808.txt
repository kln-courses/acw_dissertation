      <p>Valerie Hoffman’s <italic>The Essentials of Ibāḍī Islam</italic> is the first English-language work to present the main subjects of Ibāḍī theology in a way that is accessible to a broad audience. Among its many strengths is its readability, making it appropriate as a textbook for undergraduate courses, but also as a general introduction to Ibāḍī thought. In order to fully appreciate the extent of this achievement, it is important to remember that the academic study of Ibāḍism was for many years, as Hoffman notes in her introduction (p. 3), the purview of a few scholars scattered across the globe. Publications on Ibāḍism tend therefore to be highly specialized endeavors.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, even to define the outlines of a project involving Ibāḍī materials requires familiarity with a vast corpus of primary texts for which there is very little secondary research. Quite often there are no scholarly investigations from which to draw. Moreover, Ibāḍī history often includes events that took place away from the centers of Sunnī and Shīʿa power, and possesses an insular quality that keeps it obscure. Introducing such a field is indeed a challenge: Hoffman’s work combines an introductory approach with primary sources, and does so to great success.</p>
      <p>Who then are the Ibāḍīs? Simply put, Ibāḍī Islam “is a distinct sect of Islam that is neither Sunni nor Shiʿite” (p. 3). Emerging from the moderate strains of the Basran Khārijites, the Ibāḍīs survived into the ‘Abbāsid era to form polities in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.<sup>2</sup> They continue to exist up to the present day, and can be found in larger numbers in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Zanzibar and Oman. Thirteen hundred years of history across such diverse geographical areas has given the Ibāḍiyya a rich cultural and literary heritage, and an introductory work is considerably overdue.</p>
      <p>Although Hoffman’s work is not a general overview in the vein of Ernst’s <italic>Shambala Guide to Sufism</italic> or Moomen’s <italic>An Introduction to Shiʿi Islam</italic>, her opening chapter provides the general introduction to Ibāḍism, while the rest of the book consists of a complete translation of Nāṣir b. Sālim b. ʿUdayyam al-Rawāḥī’s (d. 1339/1920) <italic>al-ʿAqīda al-Wahbiyya</italic> (“Creed”) as well as a translation of the section pertaining to God’s power and human acts from ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Thamīnī’s (d. 1220/1808) <italic>Kitāb Maʿālim al-Dīn</italic> (“The Characteristics of Religion”). It is therefore a particular kind of introductory work, one that allows the voices of important Ibāḍī scholars to introduce and summarize the fundamentals of Ibāḍī belief and praxis. In fact, the Arabic sub-title on the dust jacket, which reads <italic>jawāhir al-ʿaqīda al-Ibāḍiyya</italic> (“the essentials of Ibāḍī creed”), is perhaps a more accurate description of the book’s contents.</p>
      <p>As a research tool, Hoffman’s book is well-suited to the task of introducing the Ibāḍiyya and their theology. It contains all of the trappings that a good research work should contain (i.e., an excellent reference list and index), plus a few extras that will assist the newcomer to Islamic theology, Ibāḍism, or even Islamic studies: a glossary (with entries ranging from the basics of Islamic studies, such as <italic>zakāt</italic>, to the relatively obscure, such as the Karrāmiyya), as well as a biographical dictionary. With Ibāḍī studies only now coming out of its infancy, and with the luminaries of the Ibāḍī world still unknown to even seasoned Islamicists, this last feature is as welcome as it is sensible.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hoffman’s introduction begins with an overview of Ibāḍī history “that adheres to the Ibadi point of view” (p. 6, fn. 8), which I take to mean that she is empathetically presenting their vision of Islamic history by letting herself paraphrase Ibāḍī historical narratives. These accounts—for example, those that accept Jābir b. Zayd as the “founder” of the school and Abū ‘Ubayda Muslim b. Abī Karīma as its organizer and first overt imam—are contested by certain contemporary scholars, and Hoffman includes discussions, often in her footnotes, on some of this critical scholarship (most notably, on Wilkinson’s recent work on Ibāḍī origins and development, <italic>Ibāḍism</italic>, which presents a revisionist account of Ibāḍī origins). As is to be expected in such concise overviews, a few details inevitably get left out. There is no mention, for example, of the North African Khārijite revolts of the 120s/740s—revolts that go a long way toward defining Ibāḍīs over and against other moderate Khārijites like the Ṣufriyya. Moreover, there is considerable confusion over the term Ṣufriyya itself, which is only partially addressed in the section on the development of Ibāḍism as a distinct sect.<sup>3</sup> Yet these are minor points: Hoffman’s adherence (more or less) to the standard narratives of Ibāḍī origins serves as a quick introduction to the long history of Ibāḍism without unnecessarily muddying the waters with mountains of detail. For the student or even diplomat with an interest in the Ibāḍiyya, such an introduction remains well-suited to the needs of clarity and concision. Specialists who require greater depth can use her footnotes as a guide for what to read in conjunction with her work.</p>
      <p>In her introductory section on the development of Ibāḍism as a distinct sect of Islam, Hoffman details some of the schisms, both external and internal, that gave definition to the Ibāḍiyya as a whole. In this part, she also offers an overview of the development of Ibāḍī literature, especially with reference to theological works. This intellectual history will prove invaluable for those unfamiliar with the large and, for the most part, unknown Ibāḍī corpus. One problem with the section, however, is that it is not always clear from the narrative which works are lost, which are still in manuscript form, and which can be found in print. For example, it is not discernible from the text that ʿĪsā b. ʿAlqama’s <italic>Kitāb al-Tawḥīd al-Kabīr</italic> is lost while Abū ʿUbayda Muslim b. Abī Karīma’s treatise on <italic>zakāt</italic> is published. The researcher may find this information by consulting Custers’ three-volume bibliography, but it would be helpful to have this information under our noses (as it were).<sup>4</sup> Notwithstanding, the great achievement of this section is how she guides her audience through the welter of Ibāḍī works.</p>
      <p>The third section of the introduction delves into an extended discussion of Islamic theology, with special attention to how Ibāḍī theologians navigated some of the traditional theological questions of the early to medieval Islamic era. Specifically, she covers the status of sinning Muslims; reward and punishment in the afterlife; free will vs. predestination; anthropomorphic descriptions of God; the place of human reason in relation to revelation; God’s unity, essence and attributes; and the created vs. uncreated nature of the Qurʾan. Also, she includes a segment on association (<italic>walāya</italic>) and dissociation (<italic>barāʾa</italic>), two topics that receive augmented attention in Ibāḍī texts: Ibāḍī treatments of these subjects can be considered (along with the imamate) as one of the defining characteristics of the Ibāḍiyya. Additionally, there is a short discussion of Ibāḍī jurisprudence that highlights distinctive Ibāḍī legal practices. When discussing Ibāḍī theology, Hoffman’s knowledge shines, as does her ability to make comprehensible its often obtuse questions. To give but one example, her succinct (a total of eight sentences!) description of al-Ashʿarī’s position on God’s absolute power and its relation to the question of human responsibility for their actions is one of the clearest that I have ever read (p. 34). Her lucidity of presentation extends to her other descriptions, making this short section of the introduction usable as a general introduction to the questions of Islamic theology.</p>
      <p>Somewhat concealed, however, is that her presentation of Ibāḍī theology tends to reflect early-modern or even contemporary Ibāḍī thinking, and in so doing glosses over some of the range of discussions that could be said to constitute the breadth of Ibāḍī theology. Of course, Hoffman’s authors hailed from the early-modern/modern period, and moreover, her introduction and translations are not meant to be a comprehensive history of theology (a work that remains to be written). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Ibāḍī theological positions have a long and sometimes complicated history. For example, the issue of the created or un-created nature of the Qurʾan was the subject of a fierce formal debate, known as the Damā debate, which took place after 230–31/844–45 in Oman. In fact, one of the debaters, Abū ʿAbdullāh Muḥammad b. Maḥbūb,<sup>5</sup> defended a position on the created nature of the Qurʾan that nearly got him ejected from Oman, whose scholars at the time were not overly receptive to an idea that smacked of Basran Muʿtazilism.<sup>6</sup> Abū ʿAbdullāh’s sons were also known for their Muʿtazilī-leaning theological views.<sup>7</sup> Hoffman’s presentation of the rather complex Ibāḍī position on the created nature of the Qurʾan—that God’s essential speech is part of His essence and thereby not created, but that the Qurʾan that is recited by people’s tongues and written in ink on pages is to be distinguished from God’s essential speech, and is therefore created (pp. 40–41)—therefore reflects a highly developed early-modern/contemporary Ibāḍī position that cannot be said to reveal the range of doctrinal views present in the early medieval period.</p>
      <p>The bulk of Hoffman’s work, of course, is devoted to the translations of her primary sources. The first author, Nāṣir al-Rawāḥī<sup>8</sup>—a relatively modern poet, judge, mystic and even newspaper editor—was the son of the judge to Nizwa, Oman during the short-lived imamate of ʿAzzān b. Qays (r. 1868–71). In other words, al-Rawāḥī is associated with a moment in modern Omani history that is remembered by many as a highpoint for Ibāḍī religio-political ideals (p. 45). The family eventually moved to Zanzibar, where al-Rawāḥī spent most of his adult life. His creed is a concise statement of Ibāḍī tenets (that is, concise relative to most theological texts that run to several volumes). The structure of the creed, which follows a format of questions and answers between student and teacher, is a bit atypical, but ultimately it succeeds as a literary device meant to introduce Ibāḍī theology. Hoffman notes that the creed would be appropriate in Ibāḍī contexts to students in secondary school, or in their first year of theological studies (p. 49). One of the obvious audiences for this translation, English-speaking non-Ibāḍī (and by and large non-Muslim) college students, might require a bit more guidance, but the work could stand on its own or as part of a larger course on Islamic theology. Graduate students and other specialists will find her translations refreshingly clear, though Syracuse University Press’s choice to forego the use of diacritical marks might present a mild distraction for some.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Others will question Hoffman’s choice, preferring Nūr al-Dīn al-Sālimī’s <italic>Mashāriq Anwār al-ʿUqūl</italic> to al-Rawāḥī’s creed. Hoffman herself notes that al-Sālimī’s treatise is similar to al-Rawāḥī’s in many ways (p. 49). It could be argued that the <italic>Mashāriq</italic> is better known among contemporary Ibāḍīs, and has the benefit of being completed, whereas al-Rawāḥī’s work is not. This reviewer finds the two works accomplishing the same goal, and therefore appreciates Professor Hoffman’s effort toward publishing and translating a relatively less familiar work. Moreover, al-Rawāḥī succeeds in achieving brevity, whereas al-Sālimī’s work runs to nearly 600 pages in the 1995 printed edition.<sup>10</sup> My assessment will certainly not be shared by all scholars of Ibāḍism, but for the purposes of a non-Ibāḍī, probably non-Muslim, mostly Western audience coming to Ibāḍī theology for what is likely to be the first time, I believe that the concision of al-Rawāḥī’s creed trumps the distinction of al-Sālimī’s <italic>Mashāriq</italic>.</p>
      <p>Because al-Rawāḥī’s incomplete text does not include a chapter on God’s power and its relation to human action and responsibility (i.e., one of the central questions of Islamic theology), Hoffman translates as the final section of <italic>Essentials of Ibāḍī Islam</italic> the section from ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Thamīnī’s <italic>Kitāb Maʿālim al-Dīn</italic>. Al-Thamīnī was a North African Ibāḍī scholar of immense stature, the author of the important juridical text the <italic>Kitāb al-Nīl</italic>, and one of the driving forces behind the Ibāḍī “renaissance” (p. 52). Al-Thamīnī’s style is more typical of Islamic theological works, and here again Professor Hoffman showcases her gift for making the difficult language of theology available to a general audience. This final section, given its topic, could also be used in comparative theology courses.</p>
      <p>Although a general introduction to Ibāḍism remains to be written, and may well have to wait until the truly impressive amount of Ibāḍī manuscripts in Oman, North Africa and Zanzibar can be digested by future generations of scholars, Professor Hoffman’s opening chapter is probably the closest to a general introduction to Ibāḍism as is currently available. The remainder of the work, especially for students of Islamic theology, proves just as rewarding. Equally important is how <italic>Essentials of Ibāḍī Islam</italic> represents a step toward making the Ibāḍī corpus more available and better known to broader audiences. In this regard, the importance of primary sources can hardly be understated. For those with an interest in the Ibāḍiyya, or non-Sunnī/non-Shiʿite perspectives on Islam, the translations provided in the book give non-Arabic-speaking audiences access to otherwise unknown Ibāḍī primary texts. This alone is a great achievement and something to be celebrated. And it is hoped that the work’s success will open the door so that more important texts of the Ibāḍiyya can be edited, published and translated.</p>
