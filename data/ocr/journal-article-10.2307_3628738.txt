<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND BELIEFS OF THE BOTOCUDO OF EASTERN BRAZIL1 CURT NIMUENDAJO INTRODUCTION THE TERM "BOTOCUDO" has been applied to three wholly distinct people: (1) The Borufi,* to use their native designation for themselves, officially designated by the Servico de Proteccio aos Indios (S. P. I.) as Aimore. These, the people visited by Prince Maximilian of Wied and by Manizer, form the subject of the present notes. They formerly lived from the Rio Pardo south- ward beyond the Rio Doce, in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Minas Geraes, and Espiritu Santo. For the time being I consider their language isolated. (2) The Botocudo of Santa Catharina and the adjoining part of Parana. These are Jules Henry's "Kaingang"; I consider them related to the Kaingang proper, but not identical with them in either speech or culture. There are two subdivisions of them. The larger one, visited by Henry in 1932-1934, lives in Santa Catharina at the post Duque de Caxias of the S. P. I.; the other, located at the post Sao Joao of the S. P. I., somewhat south of Porto Uniio in Parana, embraced, according to H. Baldus, about twelve individuals five years ago, but has probably become extinct since. Linguistically, these people (whom I have never visited) fall into the category of Southern Ge, which also comprises the Kaingang, Guayana, and Ingain. (3) The Botocudo between the middle Rio Ivahy and the Rio Piquiry, in the state of Parana. These are called Kuru-to by the Kaingang, Ivapare by the 1 Typing for this paper was done by personnel of Works Projects Administration Official Project No. 665-08-3-30, Unit A-15.

These people are nomadic, unwarlike, and extremely shy. They have never been scientifically investigated. In 1912 I saw two captives from this tribe among the Kaingang of the Rio Ivahy.

In Itambacury, 40 km southwest of Theophilo Ottino, I found a man personally acquainted with all the survivors. He said there were four pure-bloods, all fairly young, married to Neo-Brazilians, and residing apart from one another at a distance of about 8-10 leguas to the east. The news rendered a visit to the Poyisa useless. This tribe was probably the last one to abandon hostilities against the Government (ca. 1910). In Itambacury itself there now live only half a dozen mixed-breeds and three old pure-blood Indian women, only two of whom were actually there at the time of my stay. One was of the Aranaii, the other of the Poteni tribe. The latter could be used as an informant; gave me her pedigree and kinship terms; also 94</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO explaining certain matrimonial rules. In contrast to Manizer's statement, she considered all cousin marriages taboo and denied that cases of polygyny were correlated with the levirate or sororate. She could not grasp the idea of parent-in-law avoidance. FIG. 1. Area in eastern Brazil occupied by the Botocudo. 95</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Turning from the Northern Botocudo to those of the Rio Doce, I found two posts of the S. P. I.: Guido Marliere, directly on the left bank, near the railroad station Crenaque, in the state of Minas Geraes; and Pancas, 44 km north of Collatina, on the same railway line, in the state of Espiritu Santo. In Guido Marliere there are 35 Botocudo of the Nakrehe tribe, whose original habitat was in the Rio Manhuaciu region, south of the Rio Doce. Except for their speech, however, they have preserved nothing of their ancient culture. At the post there are also six other Botocudo, the survivors of tribes that formerly lived on the north side of the river, viz. three Convugn (Krenak's tribe), two Naktuni, and one Nakpie (NTgut-krak). The Convugn are the children of the deceased chief Mui' (Manizer's Mouni),2 who still wore earplugs, went naked, had two wives, and had relations with maret spirits at the time of the Russian ethno- grapher's visit. His daughter and the older son were useless as informants, being ashamed of their people's past, which they were unwilling to discuss. But the younger son obviously had the religious temperament and gave sundry bits of information, though with a certain shyness. Most valuable as an informant, however, was H4nat, the last of the Nakpie. Unfortunately his Portuguese was such that I was obliged to import Jorge, one of those highly "civilized" Nakrehe, as an interpreter after others had utterly failed in that capacity. H4nit quickly grasped the nature of my interests and began recounting stories of spirits, spooks, etc. His narratives were limited to rather brief episodes but in their aggregate (some thirty) these convey some notion of ancient Botocudo religion. This radically diverges from that of Indians I had previously visited, for I could find no trace of a cult of the dead or of demons, nor of astral myths or were-animals. They believe in an anthropomorphic celestial race, the maret, who are well-disposed towards humanity (see below, p. 101). H4nat's statements will be presented in the form he gave them. I confined myself to questioning him a little after he had completed his remarks, inquiring for familiar motifs, but rarely with any success. Strangely enough, while the Botocudo regard the Sun as a male, the Moon is considered a bisexual being. I also secured a short genealogy extending over four generations. Compris- ing persons also utilized by Manizer for illustrating sociological conditions (Mui, Beren, Iniat = Nya, and Kepruik = Kapruk), it partly confirms, partly amplifies and revises his statements. At Pancas there were thirteen Botocudo, only one cf them belonging to the Minyani-yirugn originally living here, the rest Nakreh'. 2 H. H. Manizer, Les Botocudos d'apres les observations recueillies pendant un sejour cheZ eux en 1915 (Archivos do Museu Nacional de Rio de Janeiro, vol. 22, 1919). 96</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO TRIBES AND GOVERNMENT The Botocudo lack a generic designation for themselves, since Boruni (Bory'gn) in their language denotes any Indian, irrespective of tribal affiliation. On the other hand, they distinguish the several Botocudo tribes, some of which comprised several bands, each under a special chief. The country seems to have been regarded as tribal territory, within which the constituent bands were permitted to roam at will. In any case the tribal designations are mostly topographic: Nak-pie land of labor Nak-tun land of the ant-hill Nak-rehe beautiful land Ngut-krak tortoise rock Minya-yirugn white water In April 1939 the surviving Botocudo represented the following groups: (a) Near Itambacury Naknyanuk, Arana', Poyica 10 (b) At Guido Marliere, on the Rio Doce Naktun, Nakpie, Convutgn, Minyi-yirugn 8 Nakrehe 50 68 Originally the Naknyanuk had the upper Rio Mucury for their habitat; the Arana' lived on the Rio Suaquhy; the Poyica (Jiporoc) on both banks of the middle Mucury, from Sao Matheus to the Jequitinhonha; the Naktin, Nakpie and Convugn (Crenac) north of the Rio Doce, in Minas; the Minya-yirugn in the Rio Pancas area, in Espiritu Santo; and the Nakrehe south of the Rio Doce in the Rio Manhuacu region. My informants mentioned two semi-legendary tribes. The anthropophagous Tombrek in the interior of the woods north of the Rio Doce were said to lack huts, residing between the root-buttresses of the gamelleira trees; Raulino declared that the tribe consisted solely of men. Secondly, there were the Poyekr'gn, also called Nem-ron because of their long bows. These are peaceable hunters, but prone to abduct children. According to Raulino they are usually invisible, but 97</page><page sequence="6">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY once his father had seen them roving past him in the forest. They called him over and presented him with one of the two deer they had killed. Among the Botocudo "the strongest" has always been leader, as the Indians say even today. However, "strength" does not imply physical strength (nyipmro), but supernatural power (yik'gn). All the chiefs whose names I obtained were yik'gn, as I determined from explicit statements. Two facts suggest that the former chiefs were in higher measure responsible for the band they led than the chiefs of other tribes. In the first place, a whole series of Botocudo chiefs' names has come down to us, while the literature records not a single name of the chiefs of adjoining tribes. Further, several Botocudo tribes and bands were permanently named after their leaders. Secondly, the disproportionately large number of chiefs who fell as victims of blood-vengeance in the feuds of yore is a striking fact; it is as though they alone were reckoned responsible. H4nait gave me a list of eleven leaders of the Nakpie and Convugn tribes. Of these eight-Biya'n, Ketk, Nu-tniil, Tecuk, Beren, Tomhe, Lim, Krenba--were murdered; Krenak, Mui', and Yukiiiat died from sickness. One of the most characteristic features of social life among the Botocudo was the constancy of their blood feuds, not only between distinct tribes, but even between bands of the same tribe. Sexual jealousy, highly developed among all the Botocudo, was doubtless a cause of this phenomenon, but neither the only nor the principal one. For the most part the acts of revenge formed an endless chain, and neither of the parties concerned could recall the origin of the feud. Strangely enough, I learnt of no case in which a person had been killed for suspected malicious sorcery, nor does this motif occur in any of the tales recorded by me. The following accounts were secured. Ho'a with four companions went to Kurik, a fellow-Nakpie; all he wanted was to ask him for bananas and go back home. But Kurik and three of his com- rades were lying in ambush along the road. He killed Ho'a and his father and drove the others to seek safety in flight. For a while the survivors concealed their hatred. Then, one day ten of them paid Kurik an amicable visit. Each took up a position beside one of Kurik's men, and on a prearranged signal they killed him and all his followers except one, who made his escape. The C onvuign murdered O'raii because they envied him his two wives, in whose company he was visiting them. However, the widows did not remain there, but returned to their family. The Nakpie and Convugn were living together. A Nakpie married a Convugn woman. When the tribes separated, this Nakpie remained with his wife's tribe, which killed him. When the Nakpie again met the Convuign, they feigned friendli- 98</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO ness, but attacked them at night and killed all but eight persons. However, subsequently the Convuign increased again. KINSHIP TERMS The following list was secured in March 1939 from Cunigundes, one of the last'survivors of the Naknyanuik tribe. She belonged to chief Potei's band, which in 1857 lived west of Theophilo Ottoni and whose remnants were subse- quently transferred to the mission Itambacury. ngiopuf mother, mother-in-law (w. sp.), stepmother igiopu'-andya'k mother's sister, father's sister, mothers's brother's wife, father's brother's wife ngike'n father; father-in-law (w. sp.), stepfather figik'n-andya'k mother's brother, father's brother; mother's sister's husband, father's sister's husband ngia'k brother, sister, cousin (male or female), stepbrother, step- sister ningru'k son, daughter, nephew, niece, daughter-in-law nifngdena'n grandson, granddaughter figiyoken husband, wife niandyui parent-in-law (m. sp.), son-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in- law vov6 grandparents (from Portuguese vovo, vovo) nikfinyam grandparents (according to a Nakpie informant this is the ancient aboriginal term for grandparents) [Manizer's article3 gives no list of kinship terms, but offers several statements on the subject which may be compared with the foregoing. According to him male cousins are identified with brothers by the same father but a different mother; a niece and a "belle-fille" (daughter-in-law? stepdaughter?) fall into the same category. Further, the suffixes -nu, -na are said to give the meaning of paternal uncle and maternal aunt to the words for father and mother, respec- 3 Manizer, op. cit., p. 262 f. 99</page><page sequence="8">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY tively. "En cela comme dans l'appellation particuliere du neveu, il semble que ce soit une coutume des Boruns, ainsi que des Chanes, Kaingangs, Guaranys, que d'appeler les tantes: meres,-les oncles: peres,-et les neveux: enfants." There are said to be diverse words for grandmother and grandson. Very interesting is the statement that the parents-in-law are called the grandfather (or the grand- mother) of my son, in other words were designated teknonymously. Incomplete as the list given by Nimuendaju doubtless is, his and Manizer's statements indicate at least a tendency toward a generation system-R. H. L.] MARRIAGE When Yumkren wanted to marry H4nat, she first spoke to her father, her mother being dead. He said, "Daughter, you are philandering with this lad. Do you want to marry him?" Thereupon she went to Htnat and told him she wished to marry him. Then he arranged matters with her father.4 The genealogical table recorded gives evidence of five cases of sororal polygyny, one of non-sororal polygyny, and two instances of the levirate, as follows: The chief, Teuik, was simultaneously married to the sisters Ambyik and iSgenuk; his brother, chief Krenak, with the sisters Nyimdok, Meyeb, and Rgoen. Chief Beref, husband of the sisters Yamyi and lgute, married a third sister, Muragn, after igute's death. Chief Mui' was at the same time married to the sisters Tudn and Nya; their sister, Uihak, married another Indian. Orain, not a chief, married the sisters Pang4n and KareiCu'. Chief Yakibm was simultaneously married to Kepruk and Gu4g, two unrelated women. Polygyny, though not restricted to chiefs, was thus most frequent among them, but not all of them had more than one wife. The levirate is illustrated by the following cases. When Yakibm died, his unmarried younger brother, chief Tomhe, took to wife one of the widows, Kepruik, who brought into the family two of her dead husband's children, Ueon and Tam. By Tomhe she had two more children, Uin and Tekrek. I was told that Tomhe would have married his brother's widow even if he had 4 Manizer mentions gifts to the girl's parents and the chief. He also cites the case of Tam, who had killed a capybara, which he offered to a man in exchange for his sister. How- ever, she stayed with Tam only a single night. He represents it as a normal thing for men and women to change spouses. As a special case he cites that of Mui- and his brother Iniat, who changed wives because one of them desired to be a co-wife with her younger sister (op. cit., p. 260 f.). 100</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO already had a wife. The second widow, Gu4g, as well as her children, Yapi-a and Kancin, joined her father Parak and on his advice did not remarry.5 Of Mui"s wives only Nya survived him; she married his junior half-brother, the unmarried chief Krenba. By Mui' she had a daughter, Sebastiana, and by Krenba a son, Joao. The levirate is not compulsory: Yakibm's second widow remained unmarried, while Orafi's widows both married men in no way related to the deceased, even though he had a younger brother, H4nat. My Nakrehe interpreter, Jorge, told me that in his wife's presence he was permitted to play with her unmarried younger sister as much as he wanted to; it only made his wife laugh, while she would resent such familiarity with another girl. The Botocudo do not seem to have any notion of parent-in-law avoidance. MARItT AND MAGIC In the sky there dwells a numerous race of spirits invisible to common mortals, who call them tokon. The spirits themselves grant others the power to see them and communicate with them; and by these favored persons they are called maret. The maret are credited by H4nat with ordinary Indian size and shape; but according to Raulino they are shorter by a head. There are males and females, adults and children. They live in wealth and abundance in the sky, owning everything of whatever kind is possessed by the "Portuguese," i. e. Neo- Brazilians, without having to work for it. They suffer neither sickness nor death. The maret are kind and helpful toward mankind, never growing angry. At one time in the past the Indians did not have to work at all; maret gave them everything they needed. All one had to do was to turn to one of their chosen favorites who had relations with them, then they would send the desired boon through him. In hunting there was no need to make great efforts: the maret were asked through the intermediary for game and would send it. That is why the ancient Indians practised no hunting magic. Similarly, it was left to the maret to start a cultivated plot; at most the Indians would make a clearing and move away, finding the mature crop on their return. These conceptions are illustrated by a number of episodes. 5 Manizer (op. cit., p. 261) gives a different account of the second widow's fate: "Kwak, qui devint femme de Krenak (pere du defunt) apres une longue resistance. Elle alleguait a Mouni et Kristino, qui la voulaient persuader, qu'elle ne pouvait devenir sa femme apres avoir ete sa bru." 101</page><page sequence="10">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY A man who had great supernatural power made a clearing and burnt the ground. Then he called his wife and left with her for another district. "Why, aren't you going to plant on your clearing?" his wife asked. "No," answered he, "I do not need to plant anything!" So they moved on. After a few months the man sent a kinsman from his band to inspect the plot. "What are you sending him to the plot for," the wife objected, "when you haven't planted a thing?" When the messenger got to the clearing, he found it full of the most varied fruits, all of them growing on a single stem. He brought back five corncobs. When the woman saw them, she was amazed, but her husband said, "Do you see, wife, did I not tell you?" The maret had planted on his clearing. Yakibm had great supernatural power. Once he and his people were in the woods, suffering from hunger. They begged him to ask the maret for food. So Yakibm sang to the maret, then went by himself into the forest, and brought all manner of victuals. But his people did not consider the food palatable, and when the maret through Yakibm asked whether the Indians wanted more, they declined. A woman and her six year old boy went into the woods. They had nothing to eat and wanted to gather fruits. The woman gathered caraguata fruits and piled them up so as to be able to take them home. Then she went to another spot, where there were yakitaig (cancarao) fruits. Then the boy suddenly said, "Look, Mother!" In the midst of the forest there was a heap of fine gourds. Near and far there were no cultivated plots, nothing but woods. "I wonder who has brought these gourds hither?" the woman said. "I'll take some of them home at once!" Filling her carrying-net, she brought her findings home to camp, where she reported how she had obtained them. "It was the maret," said the people, "let us fetch some, too!" All of them fetched gourds and consumed them. At first they were a bit afraid the food would disagree with them, but nothing happened. Entafi's son, Rignbru?k, said, "Father, I should like to smoke.6 You have rela- tions with the maret; beg them for tobacco for me." At night Entafi sat down and sang. He begged the maret for tobacco, and they promised to bring him some the following morning. At daybreak they sent him for trial first a new, red tobacco pipe full of tobacco. Rignbrfuk lit it and found the tobacco excellent. The people now wanted to see a leaf or this species. So Entafi brought one from the maret, as large as a banana leaf. When all had marveled at it, he returned it to the maret. In the entire district there was no tobacco. A woman said, "I want to go into the forest alone and get honey even if I have no iron ax." She found a bees' nest half way up in a tree and started to chop at the cavity with a stone ax. Then behind her she heard a voice say, "Take this 6 Note that according to Maximilian, the Botocudo learnt to smoke from the whites (Maximilian von Wied-Neuwied, Reise nach Brasilien in den Jahren 1815 bis 1817, 2 vols., Frankfort am Main, 1821; vol. 2, p. 34). Manizer found them avid of tobacco, but adds that they do not plant it (op. cit., p. 260). 102</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO iron ax!" She cried out in alarm and turned about in her fright: it was a maret holding out an iron ax toward her. Full of terror she ran away to tell about the incident at home. When the people heard it, they said she had been a fool to run away. They returned to the spot, but the maret was no longer to be seen. The Botocudo render their word yik'gn into Portuguese as forte, "strong." As stated above, all Botocudo headmen were yik'gn; but not all yik~gn were headmen. H4nat told me how the subsequent chief Biya'n became yikegn: Biyan took his weapons and went alone to hunt in the forest. At that time he still lacked supernatural power. In the woods he met a large number of maret. They seized him, threw him up into the air, caught him again, and thus played at shuttle- cock with him. At last one of them said that this was enough; they had merely acted in this way in order to give him power. Biya&amp;n went home in a daze and lay down. Then he began to sing. After that he went into the woods and the maret brought him a number of very large pineapples, which he distributed among his people. Subsequently the maret even took him with them into their big house in the sky one day. In addition to the ability of communing with the maret, yik~'gn persons have the power suddenly to transform themselves and others. This is illustrated by the following tales. A man went into the woods to hunt. He killed a howling monkey, but it remained hanging high up in the branches of the tree. He came home and told his son that he had left the monkey in the tree. Then his son begged to be allowed to accompany him into the woods in order to fetch the kill. When the boy saw the monkey in the branches of the tree, he urged his father to climb up and throw the beast down, but the man objected that the trunk was too thick for climbing. But the son kept on begging until his father finally climbed up. On top he cut up the howler into little morsels and threw them down singly. The son called up to him to throw down the entire animal, but his father would not listen. Suddenly the trunk of the tree began to swell and its branches to tremble. Then the man turned into a crested eagle, his arrows grew into talons, and he flew off whistling. His son gathered together the morsels of flesh and went home with them. A boy said to his father, "Go hunting and kill a monkey for me!"7 His father was not inclined to hunt, but the boy would not let him in peace. Then the man lost patience and said he would make a monkey for him. "That I'd like to see," said the boy. So the man struck the ground before him with his hand and beckoned, 7 It is worth recalling that according to Maximilian (op. cit., vol. 2, p. 29) monkeys are the favorite game of this people. 103</page><page sequence="12">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY and forthwith a monkey appeared. The man killed and roasted it and gave it to the boy to eat. He bade him carefully collect the bones. He himself did not eat of the beast. "How are you able to make monkeys?" the son asked. "You'll see presently," said the father, "stand over there beside the bones!" When the son had done this, the man again struck the ground with his hand and beckoned. Then all the bones entered the boy's body and he turned into a monkey. At once he climbed a tree, and in vain his mother called to him to come down. He fled into the woods. Then the man transformed the mother into a small mammal (dyehem?; said to resemble' an opossum). At first only the Lizard couple were on earth. Their children had no mouths, but ate aborally. Lizard wished to alter this. He went into the woods. Four days later he returned with a lot of jaho (according to Raulino, mutum) eggs. He laid them down on the ground in a row and assembled all the children round them in a circle. He ordered them to shout only when the eggs would burst open. Actually, when this happened, they all shouted, for they had suddenly acquired mouths. Then Lizard told his children, "I have transformed you; now you must transform us." He and his wife lay down, faces downward, and allowed themselves to be painted by their children. Thereby they turned into lizards. Those who are yikQgn may supplicate the maret for remedies against sick- ness and may even acquire the power of resuscitating the dead. Amhionio6 and his wife had many children, among them a daughter, whom they loved above all others. She died. As she was lying dead in the hut, her father had people call Tomhe, who was very yikegn, and begged him to revive the girl. Tomhe demanded some tobacco, which he held under the corpse's nose. He sang, and after awhile, the girl arose, was alive and well. She told her father to pay Tomhe well, for she had really been dead. Amhioni6' paid Tomhe a large roll of tobacco. The way in which the maret concern themselves on behalf of the soul after an individual's death will be described below. Today there is not a single yik'gn left. The term yofikyon is applied to a post three meters in height and of the thickness of a man's thigh. The wood is pau balsamo,8 which has a red heart- wood and white sapwood. At the top the post terminates in a human image about one meter in height, which is carved in such fashion that the smooth, cylindrical body is formed of the red heartwood, while the head, as well as the arm and leg stumps, are of the white sapwood. The face, uniformly turned eastward, is painted with red lines in urucu. 8 Professor A. R. Davis informs me that this is Myroxylon toluiferum H. B. K., a mem- ber of the Leguminosa--R. H. L. 104</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO The statues represent maret; they indicate the site within the village where the maret descend from the sky in order to listen to the prayer of their protege when he sings to them. In the village of the Convugn and Nakpie-what is now the post of Guido Marliere-chief Mui' erected such a statue in the anterior space, as ordered by the maret. Whenever Mui' would sing before the statue in the afternoon, all the villagers, painted red, would assemble in a circle around him. Then from six to twelve maret would descend from the sky, gathering near the statue, but no one saw them except Mui'. Through his chants he induced them to watch over the village so that no harm should happen to its residents. When- ever Mui' sang, he addressed the statue; however, the maret are not inside the yonkyon, but stand unseen beside it, subsequently returning to the sky. After Mul"s death the statue fell down. When later the grass was burnt down on the site, Mui"s sons-Pak and Mbogmam-saw that as the flames ap- proached the recumbent statue a storm arose that drove them back. Then they put out the fire and once more set up the statue. There it remained standing until the Paraguayan author Martin Barrios during his stay at the post had the statue chopped down to be taken away by him. In the long-abandoned aldea Krakatii on the upper Rio Mucury there were three yonkyon-father, mother, and son. They remained until recently, when they were probably destroyed by Neo-Brazilians. Seeing my interest in the matter, H4nait and Mbogmam made a statue for me, the former having fashioned the last yoiikyon at Guido Marliere. They asked what I intended to do with it. When I answered that I would set it up in front of my house in Para, they enjoined on me the necessity of making it face towards the east. They greatly regretted not being able to accompany me so that they might sing chants requisite for the occasion, which they alone still knew. The maret have a chief, the oldest of them all, whom Mbogmam called Yekan kren-yirugn (Father White-Head), while H4nat designated him as Boruni kren-yirugn (White-headed Indian) or Boruiii yipakyue (the Great Indian). Raulino called him Boriun maknia'm (Old Indian). He lives in the sky, but somewhat apart from the maret. He never descends to the earth and, according to these two informants, has never been seen face to face by anyone. Raulino, however, declared that formerly some people had had direct communion with him. Yekan kren-yirugn owns many tame beasts (dupren); when they bathe in the sky, they splash the water, so that rain falls on the earth. 105</page><page sequence="14">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY It is Yekan kren-yiruign that at bottom controls all remedies against sickness. If someone is ill, the people call a yikegn man, who sings in the afternoon (the proper time for intercourse with the maret), and the spirits listen. They go to their chief, Yek4n kren-yirugn and beg him for medicines to give to their protege, who then applies them to the patient. If anyone has committed murder, Yekan kren-yiruign takes away his soul and keeps it captive in the sky. The culprit's body lives on below, but grows sick and feeble. Thus declared Mui', who had seen imprisoned souls in the sky. Despite all my inquiries my three informants were unable to tell me any- thing further about this chief of the maret. They disclaimed any knowledge of the characteristics ascribed by Manizer to Maret-khmakniam, who corresponds to Yek4n kren-yiruign; or of his wife, the Russian ethnographer's "Maret-jikky.'9 SOULS AND GHOSTS Souls. Every adult has a series of souls (nakandyuii), some people having as many as five or six. However, only one of them resides in the body, the rest remaining nearby. If a person starts on a journey, several nakandyfi; precede, others follow him. A child gets his first nakandyuii at the age of approximately four, only gradually acquiring the rest. Antom-br6 is the one that brings the soul, inserts it into the body, and advises it how to behave. Concerning Antom- br6 I could learn only that he lived in the vicinity of the country known as Nak-iram; he is certainly not to be identified with Yek4n kren.yiriign. In sleep the nakandyufii leaves the body and then has experiences (dreams) by itself. The loss of the nakandyuii causes sickness. H4nat went into the woods to hunt. He met two saua monkeys (mbriki'k) which he killed and carried home. On arriving he fell down unconscious. Then a number of female saua monkeys came in the guise of pretty girls and wanted to take him away, but he offered resistance. Then he heard the shrieking whistle of the maret in his ears and forthwith the female monkeys let him go. However, he fell sick, for they had abducted his nakandyufi. They came back in human form and teased H4nait. At last three maret appeared at the door of the house. They drove the monkeys away and took H4nat to their land in the sky, where they returned his nakandyufi. They also gave him a drink and he was completely restored to health. 9 Manizer (op. cit., pp. 267-270) describes the spirit chief as a palm above the ordinary man's height, and having an immense member fatal to women. His head is all white, his face covered with red hair as far as the eyes. He sends rain and storms, but is kind to the Indians and angry when they are maltreated. It was he that instituted the use of labrets and ear-plugs, and certain songs are his. 106</page><page sequence="15">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO A girl named P4ng4n was very fond of agouti flesh. Once she ate of an agouti that was really a transformed manyakeyi'. The manyakeyi' are people who live in the south, in houses like those of the Portuguese. Pgng4n's body remained where it was, but the manyakeyi' took her nakandyini along and locked it up. Then her body began to grow sick. When her mother Yamnaik noticed this, she had people call Kadnyek who was yik(gn: he was to see what could be done. Kadnyek went to the manyakeyi' and saw P4ng4n's captured soul. He called it away on the pretense of wishing to show it something and abducted it in an auto (sic). Taking it home, he allowed it to enter P4ngan's body, and she recovered. Before the body's death the nakandyiun dies within it. When Mui' was suffering from his last illness, he said that he had seen his nakandyiui die and the maret bury it; and that now he knew definitely that he was about to die. A short time after this his prediction was verified. The other nakandyuii of a dead person accompany the corpse to the grave and soar above it weeping and invisible. They no longer eat anything and would ultimately die if the maret did not take pity on them and carry them to the land Nak-iram, White Country, in the sky. Thence they nevermore return, and no living person can ever get there. They have no significance whatever for the living. A resurrection not due to a yikegn was described as follows: A man with his wife and three children was living apart from other people. He fell dangerously ill and died several days later. His wife mourned him, one of his sons buried him, and then they all moved away.10 One day one of the sons returned to his father's grave and saw a raving wild pig there. He wanted to kill it, but it began to speak like a human being. "Don't kill me, I am your father!" There- with he assumed human shape. "I have come back," said the resuscitated man, "the wild pigs have brought me back from the underworld." Then the son wanted to see the wild pigs. His father called, and one beast appeared, which he had his son kill. Then he asked where his family was now living, and they went home with the game. He let his family eat of the pig but would not take any himself. He advised his son not to kill a snake if he should meet one while traveling. Ghosts. From the bones of the corpse the nandyon (ghost, spook) forms, i. e. the nandyon yuk4-krina' from the fresh bones as soon as the flesh has putrefied, while from the old bones there develops the nimhi -nie, recognizable by its long hair, which progresses by lengthy jumps. Other forms of nandyoni, 10 Maximilian (op. cit., vol. 2, p. 56) speaks of the quick burial of a dead person in or near the hut, which is then abandoned. 107</page><page sequence="16">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY according to Raulino, are the nandy6oi-ron (long nandyoii) and the nandyon-him (black nandyoii). The nandyoii reside in kiyem para'dn, which lies under the earth where the sun shines while it is night above ground. There the nandyoii spend their exist- ence more or less like living human beings. The maret do not allow them to return permanently to the earth and chase them away as soon as they appear. Nevertheless it happens occasionally that the nandyofi appear to the living. Unless the person who sees the apparition courageously kills or at least vigorously thrashes it, his death might result. Women are for that reason especially imperiled by such apparitions. However, in the first of the following tales even a woman has such an encounter without suffering evil consequences. A slain spook instantly vanishes. A woman said to her husband once: "Stay here, they are calling me into the forest!" When she followed the call, she found the nandyofi in the woods. They painted the woman with black pigment. When she got back, she told her husband, "This is the dress the nandyon have given me." She was able to don and doff the paint as though it were a dress. A group of Indians once encountered hunters of a hostile tribe in the woods. They fought and killed one of them. Some time after this a man from the same band went hunting. He told his wife he would stay away three or four days; in the meantime she was to sleep with her mother. The man again met the same enemies, who killed him. After the lapse of four days the woman decided to sleep in her own hut and to await her husband there. In the darkness of the night his nandyofi came to her in the hut. He lay down, saying, "Louse me!" She stirred the fire and laid the ghost's head on her lap. Then she saw that it was teeming with maggots and realized that it was her husband's ghost that had come. At once she fell dead, and the nandyoii vanished. There was a widow whose husband had been killed. She left her children home and went into the woods to gather caratinga roots. She put the collected roots down in a heap and took her carrying-net farther up the mountain in order to gather still more there. When she came back with her load she heard voices at the spot where she had left the first caratingas. There were two nandyofi. They had kindled a fire and were about to roast the roots. When the widow got there they seized her and thrashed her. She dragged herself home, told her children what had hap- pened and died shortly after. A man went to a rock to gather caraguata fruits, which were growing on the heights. He leaned his bow and arrows against the cliff and climbed up. When he had gathered enough caraguata, he descended with his load. Then he saw below him a female nandy6ni handling his weapons, fitting one arrow after another to the 108</page><page sequence="17">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO string and trying to shoot at the man, but in vain. Then the man grew angry. "What are you fooling with my weapons for?" he shouted at her. He cut off a stick and flogged her with it till she remained lying on the ground. Then he took his belongings and went home. There was a man named Entafi. He said to his wife: "Let us go into the woods to look for honey!" She answered, "Go alone!" He took his ax and went. He looked a long while till he found a bees' nest at the foot of a tree and began chopping it open. Then he heard a call. Thinking it was his wife, he replied. He pushed the bees swarming around him away from his ears and listened. Then he saw that a nandyofi came toward him. Entfan grew vexed. "What is he looking for at this very moment?" He chopped off a stick and thrashed the ghost. "So you won't annoy me again when I am looking for honey," he said. Then he went home and told the people he had thrashed a nandy6on. Then he began to sing like a howling monkey. The people wondered greatly, but he said, "The maret so ordered me." Then he went into the forest to the maret and brought food from there, and all ate. The same Entafi went out with many others to hunt in the forest. They camped for the night and slept in a long line on the ground, each one with his feet toward the fire. Entia was lying in their midst. He woke up while the others were asleep. Then he heard some one coming. He called out, but no one answered. It was a nandyoii who went to the fire, took up a brand, and went back to the woods. Entani said nothing, but decided to kill the nandyfon if he came again the following night. He made a club for himself, put it by his resting-place, and lay awake. When the others had fallen asleep, the nandyofi came again to fetch fire. When he stooped over to pick up a brand, Entafi struck him down with his club and killed him. When the fire of the nandy6on goes out in the underworld, they fetch a brand from a fire of the living. A woman said to her husband, "Let us move!" He answered, "Then go ahead!" She packed the carrying-net and went. After a while her husband followed. On the way he met two nandyofi. One of them at once attacked him, but the man wrestled with him and hurled him aside. Then the other yelled, "Hold him tight; don't let him escape!" The first one again attacked the man, who however wounded him with his knife and hurled him aside, so that he remained lying dead by the road, while his companion fled. When the man got back to his wife and told her he had killed a nandyofi, she said, "The nandyfon are dangerous! You have killed one; now you will probably have to die." But nothing happened to him. In contrast to the Kamaka and Masakari, the Botocudo do not believe in the tendency of the souls of the dead to turn into man-eating jaguars. Only after repeated inquiries I got to hear the following tale: 109</page><page sequence="18">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY A man was once camping in the woods with his wife. Then she begged him to leave her alone until she should call him, saying that she wanted to transform hIerself. She painted herself and turned into a jaguar except that from the shoulders up she remained human. Then she called her husband to her, and he was astonished at her transformation. "How can I now live with you?" he asked. She let him wait and ran into the forest, where she killed two pigs. One she brought to her husband, the other she dragged to one side and devoured by herself. She thus continued to bring game to the hut, but would not permit him to approach her. One day her head, too, turned into a jaguar's; now she was a beast all over. She ran to a site in the woods where many Indians were camped and ate every one of them. A boy who went looking for his father, who had been of the party, found nothing left of them and remained in the woods all alone. CONCEPTIONS OF NATURE In ancient times there was no night. A man came down from the sky and said to the people: "If you wish, you may kill me!" They killed him. Then night came. After a while he revived; then day came again. He went up to the sky where he came from and is now the Sun. Eclipses arise when Sun and Moon quarrel and call each other names. Then they turn black with rage and shame. The Sun is male. The great (not the waxing) Moon is male, munya'k yek4n (Father Moon); the small Moon is female, munya'k yopue (Mother Moon). Luminous meteors are called Hataran-yokea, "arara tail." The Origin of Thunderstorms. Taru (Sky; not to be identified with either Sun or Yek4n kren-yirugn) had a wife and a daughter married to Ng}n-nhin. At that time they were living on the earth. Taru had an otterskin called kriii-pakyue, which owned the secret of the upper world. Then Taru wished to collect sapucayas," he took the skin along and hung it up. His son-in-law also wished to go to collect sapucayas and asked to be allowed to take the otterskin along. Taru finally consented, but admonished him to clean the site in the woods round about where he would hang it up. Nlg4n-nhin went to a sapucaya tree and suspended the skin, but did only a little superficial cleaning in the vicinity. He ascended the tree and began to throw down the fruits which 11 The nuts of Lecythis ollaria, contained in capsules. "At the top of the vessel is a circular hole, in which a natural lid fits neatly. When the nuts are ripe this lid becomes loosened, and the heavy cup falls with a crash, scattering the nuts over the ground" (H. W. Bates, The Naturalist on the River Amazons, 2 vols., London, 1863, vol. 1, p. 67). 110</page><page sequence="19">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO fell pi-pi! on the ground in the woods. Then the otterskin began to move and rage around the trunk from which it was hung, beating against the trees with a rattling, thundering sound. A great storm rose, and from the ground under the tree the water came gushing forth. It rose very rapidly, but ,Ngn-nhin did not care about that. He threw down more and more sapucayas and they dropped into the water tUf-tu! Suddenly he noticed that the water was reaching his seat. Then he began to cry and scream. The water carried him with the otterskin up to the sky. At last the maret took pity on him and let him enter the sky. There the otterskin remains to the present day. When it moves in the sky, it thunders and the water begins to overflow; then it rains on earth. In the beginning there were no storms. The sky was so close to the earth that one could enter it from the earth; but at that time earth and sky separated. Water. (a) The great snake Nyukua'dn is lord of the water and causes floods. It signals the rain to descend by means of the rainbow (nyukua'n- imbyOgn, "urine of the great snake"). (b) The only one on this earth who had water was Hummingbird (holo- keyun). All others drank nothing but honey. Hummingbird bathed every day. The others also wanted to have water. They sent the mutum to trail Hummingbird when he went bathing, but Hummingbird went so fast that the other lost sight of him. The people assembled one day and made a fire. Irara Yopuidn came last, for he had been collecting honey. In a low tone of voice he begged, "Give me water." "There is no water here," they answered. Then he offered Humming- bird his honey for water, but he declined to exchange. While all were still standing round the fire, Hummingbird said, "I am going bathing." Irara trailed him, sticking close to his heels. Almost simultaneously they got to the water, which was in a hole in a rock. Hummingbird jumped into the water, Irara immediately after him. He splashed it in all directions, and thus originated brooks and rivers.12 The Origin of Fire. Carrion Vulture (Ambea) alone had fire. Mutum (Pandyl) lay down in the middle of the road and played dead. The blow-flies 12 Among the Yaghan, Fox is the selfish hoarder, and Hummingbird discovers his supply of water (Martin Gusinde, Die Yamana, Modling bei Wien, 1937, pp. 1207-1209). Compare the following Kaingang tale: "O beija-flor escondeu a agua em baixo duma pedra para que os outros nao pudessem beber. Disse: 'Quero tomar agua no ceu.' O Chekre, outro passarinho, achou a agua e 'pinchou' fora a pedra" (Herbert Baldus, Ensaios de etnologia brasileira, Sao Paulo, 1937, p. 60). 111</page><page sequence="20">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY laid their eggs on him and he got full of maggots. Vulture came down and brought fire in order to roast Mutum. Mutum in a low voice said to the maggots, "Don't crawl into my ears, nor into my nose!" Young Carrion Vulture sat nearby and, seeing Mutum moving his eyes, he cried out, "Father, he is not dead; he is moving his eyes!" "No, he is dead," said the old bird, "why he is full of maggots! Wait, soon we'll eat him up!" Then Mutum seized the firebrand, jumped up, and fled. Carrion Vulture pursued him. Mutum came to Heron and asked him to hide the fire. He hid it in his carrying-net and made his wife sit on top of it. Carrion Vulture looked everywhere and, not finding the fire, went away at last. Then Heron took it out and hurled it in all directions so that now there is fire everywhere. When Carrion Vulture saw this, he decided to forego the possession of fire altogether and henceforth ate his food raw. MISCELLANEOUS TALES (a) Arara was giving a feast, during which Bat began quarreling with Mutum, Arara's brother-in-law, but got the worst of it. Arara asked, "Why is he quarreling with my brother-in-law? He shall be sorry for it." People were dancing. When the feast was over and Bat was going home, Arara stepped in front of him, barring his way. He wrestled with Bat, rent him asunder, and let him lie dead on the road. He cut off his nose, by which he might have been recognized and painted him to look like a mutum. Then the bats came. They saw the dead man and thought it was Mutum. "That's right," they said, "our kinsman has killed Mutum; let us eat him." So they built a fire, roasted their own kinsman and ate him up. (b) Arara and his wife were walking in the woods looking for sapucaya fruits. For a long time they looked until at last they found a tree with fruits. When they wanted to gather them, the carrion vultures came, took possession of the tree, and drove off the araras. The arara said, "Just wait, I'll take revenge!" Then the long hair the carrion vultures still had at that time dropped off and they became bald-heads. (c) Anciently animals were like human beings, and none of them was evilly disposed towards the others. A magician came and gave them all food to eat. Then Irara had the idea of making them hostile to one another. He taught the snake to bite so as to kill or maim his victims; he taught the mosquito to suck blood. They turned into beasts, including Irara himself, so that no one should recognize him. When the magician came, he called the beasts to account, but there was nothing to be done to change things back. Then the magician transformed himself into a woodpecker, his stone ax turning into a beak. 112</page><page sequence="21">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO (d) Among the monkeys there are some that are yik~gn and lead a double life, now as beasts, now as men; i. e. they are really human, but generally appear to other human beings only in animal shape. Two men went hunting. They heard the howling monkeys howl and fol- lowed the sound. They saw a very large howler running to and fro on his branch. Both of them shot many arrows at him, but not a single one touched him. Suddenly he assumed human shape. He had a bow and a sheaf of arrows in his hands, and when the hunters again shot at him he returned their arrowshots, one of them wounding one of the hunters in the shoulder. Then the other said, "Now he has already wounded my comrade! I must kill him at all costs!" He aimed well and this time hit the howler, which tumbled down. He killed him completely and let him lie, for he felt obliged to carry his wounded comrade home as quickly as possible and treat him. When the wounded man was improving, he decided to go into the woods and see whether the howler's corpse was still lying there. But he found no trace of him. But on the spot there were several pottery sherds which had held food. The ordinary howling monkeys eat fruits, but those which are yikegn eat what human beings do. (e) An Indian named Yatuni went into the woods to hunt. He encountered a band of monkeys. Selecting the largest, he shot an arrow at it, but the monkey caught the missile in its hands, turned it round, and hurled it back at Yatuni, seriously wounding him. He dropped his weapons and dragged himself home- ward, where he died shortly after. (f) [Note: Thinking that the Botocudo might stand in the same supersti- tious awe of the jaguar as the Kamaka and Masakari, I repeatedly asked my informant H4nat to tell me stories about this animal. However, I soon dis- covered that in Botocudo belief the jaguar did not by any means loom as a supernatural being. Their tales do not reveal that excessive terror of the beast indicated in the relevant Kamaka stories. Except for one solitary instance they are pure hunting tales.] Katnap had been gathering antom larvae and wanted to eat them. He therefore asked a relative for some bananas to eat with the antom, but the kinsman refused. So Katnap took bow and arrow and went to fetch bananas himself. He filled his carrying-net with them, put it on his back, and went home- ward. On the way he found a thin branch with three twigs evenly projecting from the same point. He cut it off in order to make a tip for his bird-arrow (monheya'k) out of it. Then a jaguar, which had been lying in ambush, jumped at him. Katnap threw off his carrying-net, jumped aside, and discharged an 113</page><page sequence="22">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY arrow, but the jaguar did not mind it even though it had struck him. Again and again he leapt at the man, who always managed to elude him and kept on shooting his arrows till the jaguar was studded with them. When he had got rid of all his arrows, the jaguar jumped at the back of his neck and killed him. He ate half of him, let the remainder lie there, and ran off. When Katnap had not returned by the next morning, his relatives sent a man named Non to look for him. He found the site of the fight, the carrying- net, and the remains of Katnap's corpse. When he returned and narrated what had happened, all of them gathered and went out with dogs to kill the jaguar. The dogs found his tracks and drove him to bay. They attacked him until he was quite exhausted. Then the strongest of the men jumped at the beast and wound his arms round him. All the Indians helped, overpowering the jaguar, and tied him up alive. Then they built a big fire and burnt him alive. A relation of Katnap's beat up the man who had refused to give bananas to him and took away his wife. (g) Beren went into the woods to hunt. He had painted his arrows with urucu in order to make them more effective. He got to a spot where a tapir had been feeding the night before. While he was looking at the tracks, a jaguar appeared and jumped at him. Severa! times Beren evaded the attacks; twice he shot at the jaguar and wounded him. Then he climbed a tree. The wounded animal restlessly ran about under the tree, then finally went away. After a while Berefi climbed down and followed his tracks. Soon he saw the jaguar lying on the ground. Then he again climbed a tree and waited for the flies to swarm round the animal to make sure it was dead. He descended and called his people thither. They skinned the jaguar and ate the flesh. (h) A man went into the woods to gather caraguata fruits. He got to an open space, where there was only a spiny jaracatia tree. There a jaguar ap- peared and jumped at him. The man leapt aside, but the animal kept on jumping. The Indian yelled as loud as possible. He looked round for a tree on which he might save himself, but the only one in sight was that jaracatia. So he climbed it regardless of its spines. The jaguar lay down under the tree and waited. The man threw branches at him, but he remained there. At last another hunter answered the call of the endangered Indian. Then the jaguar got up and followed the other voice, but the man climbed down and went home. (i) Pogne went into the woods to lie in ambush by a pitangueira tree, waiting for game animals that would come to feed on the fruits which had dropped from it. While there, he was attacked by a jaguar. He evaded its leaps several times and finally found refuge on a tree. But this was dry and 114</page><page sequence="23">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BOTOCUDO broke down at the root under Pogne's weight. Pogne screamed aloud as he toppled down to the ground with the tree. Then the jaguar grew suspicious and fled. Pogne went home. (j) An Indian was hunting alone in the woods. He noticed a crowd of unknown Indians under a gamelleira tree. They were the man-eating Tombrek. Their chief was absent. When the hunter approached, they seized and killed him, cut open his corpse, and the women took out his entrails, which they carried to the stream to wash, while the men dissected the body. Then the chief returned. He examined the skin color of the slain man, which was dark, and said, "Why did you kill him? He is a mulatto!" [He did not want his people to kill mulattoes, but only whites.] Then the Tombrek said, "You are so powerful; restore him to life then!" So the chief had them bring back the entrails and had them deposited by the slices of flesh. He sang, and the man got up and remained standing upright. The chief bade him go; he took his bow and went home. (k) A man was roaming about the forest with his boy. They met the Poyekr'gn, who abducted the boy. His father came home alone. His kin said, "You ought to try to bring the boy back." So the man returned to the forest. He gathered plenty of pretty little flowers and decorated himself with them. Then he lay down beside the path of the Poyekr gn. They came, the boy in their midst. They had painted all his body black with genipapo. He saw the flowers and asked for permission to fetch them. When he got there, his father seized him by the arm and took him home. He washed him until the black pigment disappeared. MUSEU PARAENSE PARA' DO BELEM, BRAZIL 115</page></plain_text>
