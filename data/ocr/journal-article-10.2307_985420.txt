<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF DARWIN ON LITERATURE WILLIAM IRVINE Professor of English, Leland Stanford University (Commemoration of the Centennial of the Publication of The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, Annual Meeting of the American Philosophical Society, April, 1959) LISTING, in the excitement of a great work completed, the regions of the spirit which his ideas would revolutionize, Darwin does not men- tion poetry, the drama, the novel, or literary criticism. Had these possibilities been suggested to him, he would doubtless, in his own familiar phrase, have been "astonished." Nevertheless, he did of course profoundly affect not only what writers wrote about life, but what critics wrote about literature. I. INFLUENCE ON THE STUDY OF LITERATURE Literary study, like nearly everything else, had long been moving in Darwin's direction. In the Reformation theologians discovered history while disputing the relative authenticity of Catholic and Protestant Christianity.' In the seventeenth cen- tury, literary critics discovered progress while disputing the relative excellence of ancient and modern authors and thinkers. In the eighteenth century, Vico, Hurd, Wharton, and other pre- romantics discovered that the primitive ages were full of poetry and imagination, while Voltaire, Gibbon, and other rationalists discovered that they were full of prejudice and ignorance. Such discoveries permitted Laharpe to write, in his Cours de litterature, the first history of European literature. Herder, the Schlegels, and Madame de Stael now began to explain books and authors as the products of climate, geography, race, na- tional character, social institutions, historical period, and literary tradition. Goethe traced all literary genres to an Urpoesie, as in his botanical work on metamorphosis he traced all plants to an Urpflanze. Romanticism was making everybody biology-minded. Such concepts as the vital unity of the organism, classification according to arche- type, the relation of the plant to the seed, of the 1 Guerard, A. J., The growth of the historical spirit, Stanford Studies in Lang. &amp; Lit., 5, Stanford, California, Univ. Press. 1941. animal to his environment, were constantly before the minds of the historical critics.2 Sainte-Beuve (1804-1869) illustrates how bio- logical, how elaborately historical and solidly scientific, criticism had become before Darwin. Not that he was merely scientific. This remark- able man read everybody and knew everybody, experiencing, so to speak at first hand, the whole intellectual history of a half-century inside a single mind. In him a romantic idealist died young and left a melancholy skeptic doubtful even of "his own doubt" and a scientific "naturalist of minds" 3 insatiably curious about facts and mor- bidly anxious to verify them. Wisely reticent on the metaphysical influence of climate, he studied an author in relation to his heredity, his family history, his literary circle, his closest friend, his inveterate rival, his master passion, his characteristic weakness, his disciples and later reputation.4 Sainte-Beuve did not pretend to scientific certitude: the literary animal was com- plex, and having free will, not altogether pre- dictable. Sainte-Beuve was simply preparing sound monographs for some great generalizer of a more scientific age. His monographs were not only sound, but brilliant and searching; yet because of the deterministic tendency of their method, they dealt more with the author than the book, and more with essentially explicable men of mere talent than with inexplicable men of genius. The scientific method which Sainte-Beuve practiced with caution and many reservations, Taine (1828-1893) took up with triumphant self-confidence and no reservations whatever. He must-at least in the excitement of thought-have 2Wellek, Rene, A history of modern criticism: 1750- 1950 1: 209-225, New Haven, Yale Univ.

As Sainte-Beuve was interested mainly in the evolution of the individual author, Taine was mainly interested in that of national literatures and cultures, with a view to a philosophy of history. Taine illustrates how little mere facts or method make the scientist. He bristles with facts, but what he really did with them, as Irving Babbitt observes, was to line them up and make them march.5 He was a great generalizer, as Sainte-Beuve was a great particularizer. In practice, he carried Sainte-Beuve's doctrine of the master passion to a fantastic extreme-partly to make human nature more exciting, but mainly to make it more easily explicable in terms of "heredity, environment, and period." 6 Taine once likened a literature to a cage of wild animals. His History of English Literature has the effect of making criticism as clear as a demonstration in geometry and as exciting as a visit to the zoo. Actually, he was the victim of his own magnificent style, which combined great abstract clarity with brilliant local color in detail. He mistook mastery of style for mastery of subject and scientific principle. Sainte-Beuve speaks of a debt to Lamarck; Taine, of a debt to Cuvier and Geoffroy Sainte- Hilaire, though actually he owed more to Comte and Mill.7 Paradoxically, the first eminent critic to be strongly influenced by Darwin was neither a relativist nor a doctrinaire naturalist, but a conservative who eventually became a Roman Catholic. Ferdinand Brunetiere (1849- 1906) had admired Darwin since 1875. In 1890, he published the first volume of a vast work on the Evolution des Genres. Enthusiastic and laborious men sometimes expect miracles from hard labor and immense projects. His introduction reveals that Brunetiere expected a great deal both of Darwin and himself. Darwinian principles are not only to explain the evolution of literary genres, but to explain it with scientific exactitude-and thereby to put criticism on a new basis. If a new work could be judged accurately according to the laws of its genre, obviously the benefit to 5 Op. cit., 219. 6 Taine, H., Introduction, Histoire de la litterature anglaise 1: xxii-xxxi, Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1905. 7 Giraud, Victor, Essai sur Taine: son ceuvre et son influence, 26-29, 52-69, Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1902. literary excellence, and therefore to literature, would be great.8 Brunetiere's first volume treats the evolution of criticism. It traces the decline of judicial criticism based on the classical rules and the rise of his- torical criticism based on biological analogy. Brunetiere does not attempt any elaborate applica- tion of Darwinian principles. Perhaps he re- garded this work as a preliminary research into method. Criticizing his predecessors, he finds that Thierry makes literary evolution too much a matter of little-known ethnological causes, that Renan gives it too much pseudo-scientific exacti- tude, that Sainte-Beuve introduces a colorful particularity and a psychological complication that obscure general trends and laws.9 Plainly, Bru- netiere hoped to combine the judicial with the historical method, and to practise Renan's exacti- tude without falling into pseudo-science. -His volumes on the Eivolution de la Poesie Lyriqte seem to illustrate his method most fully. Here he particularly bore in mind Darwin's emphasis on origins and genealogy, and his con- cepts of progressive, retrogressive, and divergent evolution. Brunetiere begins by pointing out that lyric poetry is essentially individualistic. French lyric poetry takes its rise in the work of such Renaissance individualists as Ronsard and Du Bellay. In the seventeenth century it succumbs to the oratorical spirit of a highly social civiliza- tion and becomes scarcely distinguishable, except in form, from prose. It is revived in the eigh- teenth century as lyric prose by the romantic individualist Rousseau and then, as a useful varia- tion naturally selected, is given epic grandeur and historical local color by Chateaubriand. Restored to poetry by Chenier, it bifurcates into the virtuoso lyric of Hugo and the intimate lyric of de Musset, invades the novel in the works of George Sand and the drama in the plays of Hugo, becomes thoughtful in de Vigny and objective and im- personal in Leconte de Lisle, exhausting all possible themes and modes of expression at one stage of development before passing into another. Brunetiere concludes by observing that evolution does not necessarily mean progress and that the late nineteenth-century lyric may represent a re- trogression from previous heights. As a whole, Brunetiere's work is a disappoint- 8 Brunetiere, Ferdinand, L'evolution des genres dans l'histoire de la litterature 1: 13, Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1898. 9 Ibid. 1: 219, 235, 242.</page><page sequence="3">618 WILLIAM IRVINE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. ment. Yet- to criticize it in detail would be very nearly to lay down principles for an alternative scheme of literary evolution. Perhaps for this reason, critics have explained him rather than criticized him. He has been accused, for ex- ample, of utilizing Darwin for a partisan purpose. When he published the first volume of his J8volution des Genres, he had indeed long been waging fierce but discriminating war against var- ious forms of pseudo-science and romanticism. He might well have meant, and quite honestly, to use the prestige, the insights, and the impartiality of science to identify decadence on the one hand and to emphasize the living greatness of the past on the other.10 Actually, he seems to have made a considerable effort to be impartial, but to have arrived at the end of his long study in some be- wilderment about its ultimate significance. He emphasizes that evolution does not necessarily mean progress, and yet seems to imply that, artistically at least, progress in lyric poetry had been made since the time of Rousseau. So far as I can judge, the greatest single weakness of the JAvolution de la Poesie Lyrique is that Brunetiere connects lyric poetry so closely with romantic individualism that romanticism appears a symptom of artistic excellence and poetry, a symptom of moral decadence." In short, his greatest fault is not that he is too partisan, but that, like Taine, he is too abstract and schematic, that he exhibits too much esprit de geometrie and too little esprit de finesse.'2 To class him with Taine is perhaps unfair. Nevertheless, in his drastic use of the parallel-passage method, in this summing up of an author in a few phrases, and in his neat opposition of romanticism as inward and individual to neo-classicism as outward and social, he does grossly simplify. Brunetiere does not simplify in the interests of his theory. Had he been less simple, he might have been more Darwinian. To be sure, he does prove that literary evolution is not essentially teleological or necessarily progressive. He dem- onstrates, in broad parallel to Darwin, that poetry evolves into many divergent forms under favor- able conditions, and assimilates to prose under unfavorable; and that fruitful themes are seldom discarded until all their implications have been realized. On the other hand, for all his elaborate 10 Giraud, Victor, Brunetiere, Chefs de File, ed.

In several passages he himself suggests that his Darwinism is but a metaphor.13 One Darwinian principle which he did con- sistently apply, however, was the genetic method, which soon became a permanent acquisition for literary study, particularly in the history of ideas. Brunetiere was at his best as an historian of ideas. Significantly, two other eminent scholars in this field, A. 0. Lovejoy and J. B. Bury,14 were also deeply interested in Darwin and in evolution. Brunetiere's American disciple, Irving Babbitt, produced in his Rousseau and Romanti- cism one of the best-known twentieth-century studies in the history of ideas. Like his teacher, Babbitt invokes the prestige and the example of science. In fact, he invokes them against science itself-in attacking what theologians call "the naturalistic fallacy" in ethics: to be truly scientific, he says, the critic must not only study the facts with proper detachment and exactness, but he must take account of the law for man as well as the law for thing.15 In the United States, Taine aroused much more interest than did Brunetiere, and-in vague com- pliment to Darwin's vast prestige-was mistakenly regarded as the chief exponent of Darwinism in literature. His exaltation and practice of literary energy, his vivid facts and clear, startling gen- eralizations exerted an almost hypnotic effect, from which even such men as Henry James and W. D. Howells did not entirely escape.'6 Mean- while, in the United States, as in England, journalistic critics propounded all sorts of vague and pretentious Darwinisms. In England, Walter Bagehot explained the evolution of style, and, in the United States, Archibald Henderson 17 explained the evolution of the drama, by natural selection. Bagehot's discussion is brief-a mere literary illustration in 13 L'Pvolution de la poesie lyrique 2: 287. 14 Bury, J.

Bagehot begins by observ- ing that an age, like a nation, develops its own special character and taste.18 How does it do so? Potentially at least, it slightly prefers certain ideas presented in certain words to other ideas presented in other words. Sooner or later a vigorous, forward man, like Steele in Queen Anne's age, strikes out a rough notion of the timely style. Other writers are impressed and unconsciously imitate him, until a meditative and fastidious writer, like Addison, brings the style to perfection. Meanwhile, the style itself has deepened and confirmed the preference. Those readers who dislike it read earlier literature. Those writers who do not use it find few or no readers. In a long paper it would be necessary to discuss examples of Darwinian influence once removed, as in the pragmatic and Marxist critics. Here it is sufficient to point out that the most important contribution of Darwin to literary study was the concept of genetic development. II. INFLUENCE ON THE PRACTICE OF LITERATURE In the strict literary sense, Darwin wrote little prose and less poetry, yet few English poets or prose writers have influenced English literature so much. Properly, the story begins some time before Darwin. In the disintegrating religious civilization of the Renaissance and Reformation, England early developed a scientific tradition. With the authority of a Lord Chancellor, Bacon had ridiculed deductive thinking about books and recommended inductive thinking about nature. With an authority even more impressive, Newton had demonstrated that astronomical nature oper- ates as a vast and precise machine. Locke now explained how Newton's quantitative nature of matter and motion produced in the human mind a qualitative experience of sensation and reflection, and from the finite intelligences of men on the one hand and the order, harmony, and beauty of nature on the other, he inferred an infinite, benevolent, creative Intelligence. Thus, nature became a kind of alternative revelation. God was certain as mathematics-and nearly as cold. Such a nature might have been little more than 18 Physics an&amp;d politics, works and life 8: 22-24, London, Longmans, Greene, 1915. a short way to skepticism had not platonists like More and Cudworth seen in it a pervasive, activat- ing spirit and eloquent sentimentalists like Shaftesbury and Rousseau, an inspiring beauty and a beneficent moral influence. Nature con- ceived as beauty and benevolence had thus led to a faith in which men might find some of the grandeur and consolation of traditional religion without having to believe in an outmoded theology or subject themselves to a rigorous and depress- ing moral system.' The great exemplar of this faith was of course Wordsworth. As Locke in his Essay explains how sensation and reflection build up mind,2 so Wordsworth in his "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey" describes in a more general way how impressions and associations have in his case built up soul. Beholding the same landscape once more after five years, he sees that it has provided him with an inward store of beauties which have comforted him in weariness, softened him in irritation, and in rare moments raised him to a sublimer mood In which the burthen of the mystery Of all this unintelligible world Is lightened: and . . . with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,3 he sees into the life of things. In his Biographia Literaria 4 Coleridge politely indicated some of the defects of Wordsworth's creed, and Wordsworth himself discovered, even before subsiding into old age and Tory Christi- anity, that he needed something more than the scenery around Tintern to chasten his spirit and sweeten his temper. Yet the religion of nature remained an element to be reckoned with in the thinking of literary men. Thereafter, it became revolutionary in Shelley, safe and Anglican in John Keble, and, in America, transcendental in I Beach, Joseph W., The concept of nature in nine- teenth-centtury English poetry, 4-8, New York, Mac- millan, 1936. 2 David Hartley was the immediate influence.

Emerson, and-joined with other eighteenth- century furniture which Bernard Shaw thought characteristic of the American mind-boisterous and noisy in Walt Whitman. As a serious creed, however, it faded with the rosy haze and the infinite promise of the revolu- tionary period. Even before it faded, evangelical Christianity had been revived among the lower and middle classes by John Wesley, and made politically and socially formidable by the Reform Bill of 1832. Living simultaneously, and with much bewilderment, in an old world of faith and a new world of industry and - science, most educated Victorians were at once too religious and too practical to regard nature worship as much more than a lesser revelation to be perused on picnics and excursions. The sentimental rational- ism of the deists gave way before the gloomy, deterministic rationalism of the political econo- mists and the even gloomier, deterministic ration- alism of Calvinistic preachers. Moreover, to re- cover a religion involves the risk of once more losing it. Hume and Gibbon reappeared with all their skeptical horrors and fascinations. Young men laid down their Byrons to pick up their Shelleys, and often went on to read Laplace and Lamarck with fear and trembling. Thinking was at first an exhilarating, and then a dangerous and depressing occupation. Doubt became chronic, and ulcers often had metaphysical causes. Scan- ning the heavens in the eighteen-thirties, Tenny- son saw in his darker moods not the Newtonian harmonies of benevolent Intelligence, but blind mechanism and vacant immensity.5 In fact, Tennyson illustrates how Darwinian a poet could be before Darwin. He also exemplifies, within the confines of a single mind, the long Victorian warfare between science and religion. The son of an Anglican minister and the im- pressionable nephew of an aggressively Calvinistic aunt, he was morbidly afraid of death and mor- bidly eager for religious certainty. As a student of Whewell at Cambridge, he had read Lucretius, Buffon, Lamarck, and Laplace, and formed a life-long interest in scientific thought and dis- covery.6 In 1833 his close friend Arthur Hallam died at the outset of an apparently brilliant career. Tennyson's deep-seated fear of death was pro- vided with a locus and an object. Was there a benevolent governance to this unsatisfactory uni- 5Tennyson, Alfred, It memoriam, poem 3. 6 Stevenson, Lionel, Darwinism among the poets, 57-59, Chicago, Univ. Press, 1932. verse, a personal immortality after death? Pen in hand, Tennyson ruminated for seventeen years and, among other poems, produced "The Two Voices" and In Memoriam. Early in his rumina- tions, in 1837, he read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology.7 To the abyss of space, Lyell added an abyss of time, and filled it with the Darwinian facts of struggle for survival and extinction of species. He did not, of course, present the pos- sibly consoling fact of upward evolution. That Tennyson seems to have got from R. W. Cham- bers' Vestiges of Creation, first published in 1844. At any rate, Lyell documented Tennyson's darkest fears. What we remember best from In Memo- riam is the nightmare nature "red in tooth and claw" which replaced Wordsworth's benevolent teacher and companion. Actually, the poem is a museum of the significances of the term: we encounter nature as mechanism, as violence and death,, as proliferation and waste, as disfiguring decay, as endless change, as the "ape and tiger" within man, as pathetic fallacy, as beauty and consolation, as the visible manifestation of platonic soul and of departed spirits as well as of Divine Love and Law, and of human and cosmic progress or evolution moving toward a far-off divine event.S The poem presents a rather contrived victory. Tennyson decides, not so much that the Universe is good, as that it is better than he had thought, and may eventually become perfect. The vision of death, personal and scientific, is dispelled by a clamor of Christmas and marriage bells. Lyell had familiarized Tennyson with nature as futile abundance and ferocious struggle. La- place and Chambers had provided him with concepts of evolution. Actually, the nebular hypothesis remained his favorite symbol of up- ward progress or development: Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs, And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.9 Tennyson had thus faced Darwinian realities be- fore The Origin of Species appeared in 1859. When Darwin called on him at Farringford in 1868, Tennyson said, "Your theory of Evolution does not make against Christianity," and re- ceived the almost too reassuring reply, "Certainly 7Ibid., 60. 8 Poems 3, 5, 55, 56, 97, 106, 109, 111, 118, 120, 123, 124, 126, 130 &amp; epilogue. 9 Locksley Hall, 11. 136-137.</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 103, NO. 5, 1959] INFLUENCE OF DARWIN ON LITERATURE 621 not." 10 Tennyson was no doubt haunted by The Origin, but he did not fully accept it. He seems like Lyell to have remained complexly undecided all his life, steadfast only in regarding man as a creature who was distinguished by a supernatural principle and who fulfilled it by putting down the ''ape and tiger" within him. In a world that grew steadily more Darwinian Tennyson grew steadily more pessimistic. At times he ventured on a thin and timid trans- cendentalism. "De Profundis" preaches the pla- tonic descent of the soul from eternity: the child develops finitely and mortally in the flesh, in- finitely and immortally in the spirit. "The Ancient Sage" discovered the Absolute in the cautious anonymity of "the Nameless," who sustains the phenomenal world like the Berkeleyan God and who speaks in the depths of the self intuitive truth which must be heeded above reason and the senses." But on the whole Tennyson was reluctant to climb into the soft cotton wool of transcendentalism which protected Carlyle and, to a lesser degree, Browning, from the sharp edges of both scientific fact and Christian dogma. The impact of post-Tennysonian progress on a morose temperament produced inward gloom and outward cynicism: in his old age Tennyson fre- quently sounded like a very formidable Diogenes looking out of a rather luxurious tub. From the naturalistic premises of Darwin and the skeptical premises of Hume, he drew with scandal- ized outcries the hedonistic conclusions of Walter Pater.12 In The Promise of May his villain Edgar discusses sensational automatism in man and blind cruelty in nature while seducing a country maid. In the monologue "Lucretius," the hero pays for a too deep knowledge of nature with brutalizing sex-hallucinations, and commits suicide because he lacks a restraining faith in the gods. The Origin of Species affected people variously according to the interests and convictions they brought to it. It discouraged orthodox believers because it undermined Genesis. It discouraged all theists because it undermined the argument for benevolent design in nature, explaining evolu- tion according to principles which seemed, even to many biologists, a combination of chance, blind mechanism, and ruthless cruelty. In each gen- eration, a species forces murderous competition 10 Tennyson, Hallam, Alfred Lord Tennyson, a memoir 2: 57, New York, Macmillan, 1898. "See Beach, op. cit., 426. 12 See Tennyson's short poem, By an evolutionist. on itself by vastly over-populating its environ- ment. Individuals vary "accidentally" not only in hardihood, but in basic structure. Favorable variations in stamina and structure are preserved simply because the vast majority of the less fit does not survive long enough to mate, or at least to mate very often. Baldly stated, Darwinism means evolution by the mass slaughter of failures. On the other hand, it did mean the preserva- tion of success; it did mean evolution-for the most part, upward; it did mean a spectacular advance in scientific progress. For these reasons, it produced confidence and optimism, particularly at first, among many rationalists and utilitarians. Of these the crassest was the influential philoso- pher Herbert Spencer. He valued The Origin partly because he felt he had discovered all its best ideas for himself long since and partly be- cause he saw in it-as Darwin did not-confirma- tion of his own general system. Spencer held that evolution and progress were much the same thing, moving from interstellar chaos up to a rugged individualism like his own.13 He re- joiced in natural selection, not because it was cruel but because it was realistic and Victorian. How reassuring to find that the universe was built on sound business principles! A much wiser philosopher of progress was Walter Bagehot. He did not expect evidence of benevolence or design in the natural order, and therefore was apparently not disturbed in his religious con- victions by The Origin. In Physics and Politics, first published as a series of articles beginning in 1867, he brilliantly applies the principle of natural selection to human societies, and shows how the universal war of savage life evolves into the rational peace of a high civilized community like the British, in which even constitutional issues may be decided by parliamentary debate. But of all those to whom The Origin was a gospel of hope, the most notable, and perhaps in the long run, the most influential, was the biologist Thomas Huxley. In his hands Dar- winian doctrine became a sword of realism with which to shatter the great conspiracy of reticences and decencies, pieties and hypocrisies, by which Victorians lived righteously as ostriches in the strange new world they were so busily building up. Huxley's career had prepared him for his destiny. Sitting long hours in church as a boy, he acquired a zeal for the evangelical virtues and an animosity 13 Somervell, D. C., English thought in the nineteenth century, 3rd ed., 137, London, Methuen, 1936.</page><page sequence="7">622 WILLIAM IRVINE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. against evangelical clergymen. At sixteen, he implemented that animosity by becoming an agnostic. At thirty-four, as a superhuman young professor of natural history, he read The Origin, accepted evolution, and cautiously admitted nat- ural selection as a tentative hypothesis. In the great controversy that followed, Huxley forgot all his caution and most of his tentativeness. Darwin had found his Paul. Huxley acclaimed the great book as a sweeping stride in the tri- umphant march of scientific progress, as a com- manding generalization illuminating the unity of nature, and as a convincing scientific alternative to the obstructive fables of Genesis. In Man's Place in Nature (1863), brushing aside the scruples of Lyell and Tennyson, he hastened to prove that man was simply a more intelligent ape who had begun to progress in civilization by learning to speak and to obey some instincts and control others. At this time he seems to have believed that man needed self-control and virtue not only to progress, but to maintain his total bodily and moral health. Apparently, the natural order had a moral dimension, and excess of whatever kind had its penalties. In a famous letter to Kingsley (1860), Huxley had declared that in this life "the wicked does not flourish nor is the righteous punished. . . . As we live, we are paid for living." '4 Clearly, Huxley had accepted the universe with a vengeance. In "The Physical Basis of Life" (1868), Huxley reduced man, along with the rest of living nature, to the breath-taking simplicity of a substance called protoplasm. Thought itself is but molecular change in protoplasm. Obvi- ously, intellectual progress depends on the victory of matter and causation over spirit and spon- taneity. To be sure, the author introduced a subtle doubt as to what matter and causation were, but most people forget the subtlety in the exhilarating, convention-crushing simplicity of the essay. Anything so clear and eloquent could scarcely fail to be influential. Through the sixties and seventies Huxley con- tinued to wage multifarious war against earth and heaven, building Darwinism on the ruins of Genesis and creationism, and clearing a space for scientific education along the battered edges of the classical curriculum. Yet he was by no means too busy or too angry to think. Both his own political studies and several recent books might 14 Huxley, Leonard, Life and letters of Thomas Hentry Huxley 1: 233-239, New York, D. Appleton, 1901. have led him to reconsider the larger implications of evolution by natural selection. In his Candid Examination of Theism (1876), G. J. Romanes had documented the famous lines of In Memoriam with a biologist's indictment of nature for tor- ture, murder, and other crimes. In one of his Three Essays on Religion, posthumously pub- lished in 1874, John Stuart Mill had devastatingly explored the whole relation of nature to morality and theism. Asked to give the second Romanes lecture at Oxford for 1893, Huxley seized the opportunity to face once more the problem of man's place in nature. Though now sixty-seven and in ill health, he was as usual all courage and decision, all clarity and good sense. Two proc- esses obtain in the universe: the cosmic and the ethical: The first plunges all sentient beings into a welter of change, an ordeal of struggle, suffering, and death; the second has enabled man to live in comparative harmony with his fellow man and to become the dominant animal on the planet. Only partially emancipated from nature, he still suffers pain, still battles the ape and tiger within him. Nevertheless, Huxley concluded, "I see no limit to the extent to which intelligence and will, guided by sound principles of investigation and organized in conscious effort, may modify the conditions of existence, for a period longer than that now covered by history." 15 This sentence might be understood to involve many expedients, such as socialism, with which Huxley was not in sym- pathy. "Evolution and Ethics" does in fact give powerful support to those who, like Ruskin, had begun to attack competition as a social and economic doctrine. Huxley had as usual cut the Gordian knot, and left the broken strands for lesser men to ravel up. The lecture shows, besides its insistence on waste and cruelty in nature, other marks of late nineteenth-century pessimism: there is something of Hardy's hostility to the universe, something of Pater's preoccupa- tion with the swiftness and complexity of ex- perience. Yet the suggestion that man could in great degree make his own environment was profound and courageous. Huxley had given the doctrine of progress fresh vitality and definition. The Origin of Species had clearly indicated that man was an animal. Those who accepted this proposition were confronted with the ancient naturalistic alternatives: man should seek his destiny or happiness in terms either of epicurean 15Evolution &amp; ethics, Evolution &amp; ethics and other essays, authorized ed., 85, New York, D. Appleton, 1897.</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 103, NO. 5, 1959] INFLUENCE OF DARWIN ON LITERATURE 623 pleasure or of stoic reason. Swinburne and Pater tended to the first; Huxley and Matthew Arnold clearly embraced the second. Meredith, Butler, and Shaw injected a little of the first into a great deal of the second. But even as an animal, man looked very dif- ferent from different perspectives. Evolution and progress can do much for low origins, and they can promise even more. Stultifying aggressive creationists in the sixties, Huxley had proved that man was an ape. Illuminating pessimistic Dar- winians in the nineties, he had emphasized that man was a very remarkable ape, and might even be something of a hero. But if a hero, why not a God? To such nonsense, Huxley himself would not have listened for a moment. Other rational- ists, either to conciliate or to shock the Vic- torian religious sense, were quite willing to regard man as at once divine and animal. Mill seems to have wished to mitigate the free thinkers' crushing sense of isolation, by replacing the com- munity of God with a community of man. In his later works, Comte had propounded a Soci- ocracy dedicated to the worship of humanity as le grand etre-a faith which Huxley damned as "Catholicism minus Christianity." I' In his "Ethics of Religion" attempting, unlike Comte, to describe the facts of life exclusively in terms of biological evolution, W. K. Clifford had found in man a reality at once older and younger than the concept of God: "From the dim dawn of history and from the inmost depths of every soul. the face of our father Man looks out upon us with the fire of eternal youth in his eyes. and says, 'Before Jehovah was, I am.' "17 The quotation is strikingly suggestive of certain lines in Swin- burne's "Hertha" (1871).18 When in the eighties and nineties Tennyson saw hedonistic consequences in Darwinian causes, he was, like so many elderly prophets, denouncing a future that was already becoming the past. Iniquities which Tennyson scarcely dreamed of Swinburne had with headlong precocity already celebrated, and perhaps embraced. He had learned the habit of rebellion from his grandfather, free thought and republicanism from Oxford dons like Nichol and Jowett, art for art's sake from Hugo, and a satanic inversion of values from 16 The physical basis of life, methods and results, authorized ed., 156, New York, D.

Blake, Shelley, and Baudelaire.19 Already in 1866, Poems and Ballads opposed pagan hedonism to Christian morbidity, and to Tennysonian do- mestic love, an eroticism which, pushed to the extremes of satiety, sadism, and the longing for death, seems quite as morbid as anything Swin- burne reprehended in Christianity. But of course hedonism in practice proved as debilitating as hedonism in poetry was exhilarating. By way of distraction, Swinburne was introduced to an old hero, Mazzini, the aging but picturesque martyr of Italian republicanism-and the ad- vanced aesthete quite abruptly became a some- what old-fashioned humanitarian. But Swinburne could not suppress his genius for grandiose paradox and desecration. In its deification of an evolutionary Life Force, his humanitarianism is startling and new. Swinburne is not, like Mill, concerned with the moral character of the First Cause, or, like Huxley, with the contrast between cosmic and ethical process. In "Hertha," the life-giving mother Earth declares simply that she is "that which began"; 20 she is the all-embracing power who reconciles within herself all contraries of subjective and objective, who has raised up life from the depths to man, who has seen his gods arise and perish according to his need, who sanctifies everything but Victorianism: I the grain and the furrow, The plow-cloven clod And the plough-share drawn thorough, The germ and the sod The deed and the doer, the seed and the sower, the dust that is God.2' The time for superstition and slavery has passed. Ethically, Hertha preaches "love, the beloved Republic" 22 and freedom in thought and action. In his "Hymn of Man," the poet sings the blind purposelessness of man's early struggle upward, his perils and sufferings, his helplessness before the power of things, his slow victory over them, his superstitious invention of a God who judged him and who now has been judged by him, the free and triumphant reaching out of his mind and spirit into the abysses of the universe. Swin- burne concludes, truculently parodying the lan- guage of Christian ritual: 19 Chew, Samuel, Swinburne, 24, 116-121, Boston, Little, Brown, 1929. 20L. 1. 21 Ll. 3640. 22 Ll. 190.</page><page sequence="9">624 WILLIAM IRVINE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Glory to Man in the highest! for Man is the master of things.23 "Hertha" certainly contains the idea of evolution, and the "Hymn of Man" may contain some hint of Darwinism; but one doubts that Swinburne read The Origin of Species. He seems to have read everything but prose. Swinburne is one of the first great anti- Victorians. Like Huxley, he used Darwinian and other kinds of realism to shatter the Vic- torian decencies, but to an extent that must have shocked Huxley himself. His erotic poems must have risen on the horrified consciousness of elderly Victorian repression like a dream of lust and obscenity. His poems of natural religion are nearly as full of animosity against the Victorian God as of piety for universal man. He seems almost to have invented one religion in order to destroy another. Apparently inspired by Swinburne,24 George Meredith made a much more constructive effort. His mind had been improved by a combination of hard work and hard knocks. For several years a schoolboy in Germany and for many years a professional reviewer, as well as reader for a publishing house, he had an acquaintance, more or less profound, not only with several literatures, but with Biblical criticism and scientific theory.25 In English literature he was deeply influenced by Wordsworth and Carlyle; in French, by Moliere; and in German, by Goethe-and, partic- ularly, by his "Fragment iiber die Natur," which, at once rapturously and hard-headedly, accepts nature in all her beauties, contradictions, and cruelties. Meredith had lost his religious faith in childhood. Six-weeks' adolescent religious fever had vaccinated him against evangelical orthodoxy for a lifetime. But in him, as in others, the need to believe survived the destruction of dogma. Huxley had more or less unconsciously read moral values into scientific method, and even religious values into agnostic doubt. Meredith made a very conscious and elaborate effort to found romantic nature-worship and Victorian religious experience, somewhat revised and rarified, on scientific and evolutionary fact. His nature poetry is naively Wordsworthian. One hears nothing of the struggle for survival. The "South-West Wind in the Woodland" (1851), like so many of his poems, makes nature 23 L. 200. 24 Beach, op. cit., 470-471. 25 Stevenson, op. cit., 183-184, 187, 195. an Aeolian lyre of tree branches played on by the wind. The wind is a definitely platonic wind, carrying aesthetic and religious messages from a beneficent world soul. The "Ode to the Spirit of Earth in Autumn" (1862) depends on the same figure, but now the wind carries intimations of more somber realities-of struggle, suffering, and death. But the man who truly loves nature finds no contradiction between her goodness and his mortality. He lives in her eternal life: And may not men to this attain? That the joy of motion, the rapture of being, Shall throw strong light when our season is fleeing, Nor quicken aged blood in vain, At the gates of the vault, on the verge of the plain? Life thoroughly lived is a fact in the brain, While eyes are left for seeing. Behold, in yon stripped Autumn, shivering grey, Earth knows no desolation. She smells regeneration In the moist breath of decay.26 Not until "The Woods of Westermain," pub- lished twelve years after Swinburne's Songs be- fore Sunrise (1871), does Meredith assemble his ideas into a system. The Woods of Wester- main are not vocal but still. They are a place of sinister and enchanted beauty, reaching back in time and space, like Conrad's novelette, to a deep darkness, where All the eyeballs under hoods Shroud you in their glare.27 The key to the woods is first courage and then love. Courage enables the wayfarer to minimize negatives-to withstand attack, endure pain, and accept death. Love enables him to value positives -to share in nature's joyous life, to feel her beauty, and ultimately, to understand her good- ness. Indeed, love teaches courage: You must love the light so well That no darkness will seem fell.28 Love teaches man to see through the surface beauty, ugliness, and comedy of nature into her depths, to see that her "Fount" or motivating power is love and its "reflex" 29 or counterpart is 26 Ode to the spirit of earth in autumn, Poetical works, with some notes by Trevelyan, G.

Love and reason teach enlargement of self and devotion to others. They teach that "Change," or evolution, will bring further enlarge- ment, that Change, the strongest son of life Has the Spirit here to wife.30 Through struggle and natural selection 31 life has evolved from "Blood" or animal ferocity, up to "Brain," and from Brain-through the subjuga- tion of Blood and the enlargement of self-up to "Spirit." 32 Nature attains spirit through man, her highest achievement; and apparently man, when he achieves spirit, may see that life has in its destiny involved spirit from the first: Look with spirit past the sense, Spirit shines in permanence.33 Meredith says all that can be said for nature, and perhaps a little more, too. So much courage and love imply a certain minimum act of faith, and to assert that nature has a beneficent purpose is probably to go beyond strict evolutionary fact-in certain passages, indeed, very nearly to make Wordsworth swallow Darwin. Yet of all nature creeds, Meredith's was perhaps the most realistic, enlightened, and consistent. It was, certainly, a creed for the strong. Some men did not feel so strong-or at least so cheerful. One of these was Thomas Hardy. Had he lived in the early nineteenth century, Hardy might have rejoiced in the benevolence of nature and hailed the French Revolution as a return to a golden age. But Hardy was young when the commanding book was not the Smile but The Origin of Species-and when people thought little about the inspiring prospect of upward evolution and much about the clumsy and bloody methods by which evolution was accomplished. Hardy is almost the classic case of the evolutionary pessimist. He found no consolation in evolution or progress, and brooded on the methods of evolution for a lifetime. Why could he take no comfort in progress? Actually, he seems to have disliked progress- both for romantic and personal reasons. A sensitive, apparently somewhat fearful nature, Hardy had grown up in the tranquil, happy security of village life, and had then faced loss of faith, together with all the problems and 30 Ibid., 199. 31 The earth &amp; man, op. cit., 240. 32The woods of Westermain, op. cit., 201-202. -33 Ibid., 200. responsibilities of manhood, in the deep, distract- ing solitude of a great and strange city. One can understand why he scorned Philistines, disliked cities, and resented the intrusion of modern progress upon the rural Wessex of his secure and happy childhood. Perhaps civilization rep- resented for him an intellectual and moral ma- turity which he had accepted fearfully, only half- willingly. Perhaps he simply abhorred cast-iron bridges and lacked insight into tea-party psy- chology. At any rate, unlike Swinburne and Meredith, he felt no enthusiasm for the intel- lectual and spiritual achievements of man. In a Darwinian universe, man is a mistake: . . .the human race is too extremely developed for its corporeal conditions, the nerves being evolved to an activity abnormal in such an environment. Even the higher animals are in excess in this respect. It may be questioned if Nature, or what we call Nature, so far back as when she crossed the line from in- vertebrates to vertebrates, did not exceed her mission. This planet does not supply the material for happiness to higher existences. Other planets may, though one can hardly see how.34 Here the doctrine of romantic maladjustment is applied on an extraordinary scale. What, in Rousseau or Byron, the solitary romantic genius suffers from a cruelly indifferent society is par- allelled in Hardy by what all the higher animals suffer from a cruelly indifferent universe. What is decisive in both cases is the impact of ap- parently unnecessary suffering on humanitarian sensitivity. Much of what is basic in Hardy's art can be explained in terms of a tenderness and pity which spring partly from fear. The power- ful undercurrent of Victorian anxiety came to a climax in Hardy, and openly indicated the moral governance of the universe. Hardy's attitude toward nature is complex. In a passage of The Dynasts, he refines her nominalistically down to a "lay-shape" on which men hang phenomena.35 In "The Lacking Sense," he identifies her with the laws of the universe, describing her as a blind mother who "wounds the lives she loves." 36 Similarly, in the poem "In a Wood," associating her with the struggle for survival, he reverses Wordsworth and deplores what trees have made of trees. But usually he regards her not as the author, but, like man, 34Hardy, Florence E., The early life of Thomas Hardy, 285-286, New York, Macmillan, 1928. 35 Quoted in Beach, op. cit., 503. 36Collected poems, 107, New YQrk, Macmillan, 1948.</page><page sequence="11">626 WILLIAM IRVINE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the victim of the cosmic process, and pities her for her suffering. Moreover, as a primitivist, he exalts the natural above the artificial. In his novels, country people are usually better, and even wiser, than city people. Of course, he projects his pessimism into nature, as Wordsworth projects his optimism. Hardy is the poet of autumn and winter, of rain and frost, of decayed leaves and still pools, of perished skylarks and desolate thrushes. The obverse of Hardy's pity for man and na- ture is, as I have suggested, indignation against the blind and savage determinism which seems to rule the universe. It is customary to observe that Hardy eliminates anthropomorphism from his thinking. In effect, possibly so; but in practice, he makes his resentment intense and dramatic by projecting an anthropomorphic point of view into heaths, cliffs, animals, gods, demons, and abstractions-not to speak of ghosts and dead men. But mainly, of course, for purposes of irony and execration, he personalizes the cosmic process itself. God is an imbecile; he is dying from the brain downward; he is clumsy and forgetful; he is evil and malignant.37 Indeed, in the fine novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles, the "President of the Immortals" is not altogether above suspicion of popping out of cosmic trap- doors in a tall silk hat and black moustachios. In later years, apparently after reading Schopen- hauer and von Hartmann, Hardy identified the blind proliferation of nature with the will-to-live, reason with the will-not-to-live, and determinism with the unconscious Immanent Will. The rationalism of science had here eventuated in the rationalism of death. After Hardy, poets continued for another gen- eration-though in diminishing numbers and in extremer form-to think the same thoughts about the same Darwinian dilemmas. William Watson is a minor Tennyson, making more modest de- mands on an even more anonymous Deity. Robert Bridges is a more platonic Meredith, reconciling natural selection and evolution with the eternal essences. Robinson Jeffers is a more drastic Hardy, condemning civilization with a more radical primitivism and life with a more passionate death-wish. Lawrence Binyon is simply reticent and impersonal about nature; William Butler Yeats escapes from it into an occult platonism of his own. Meanwhile, in the Conclusion to his Renaissance (1878), Walter Pater had explained 87Ibid., 58, 106, 110. that conceptual thought is very nearly impossible in a brief life of unique and intense sensations. Accordingly, many poets attempted to think less and to feel more. Form became an end in itself, and the literatures of East and West were ran- sacked for new styles and idioms. Poetry be- came irrational, psychological, esoteric, urban, satiric. In short, insoluble dilemmas continued insoluble. Darwinism had contributed to pro- duce an intellectual and artistic climate in which nearly everybody accepted Darwin and hardly anybody thought about him. In the novel-a younger, more conservative, and indeed more profitable genre than poetry- the greater writers hardly ventured to think till well toward the end of the century, but the lesser speedily capitalized on the sensation created by The Origin, ridiculing evolutionists at first, then recounting more or less melodramatic his- tories of religious disillusionment and despair, and at length-mainly in the eighties-expound- ing some of the more facile efforts at compromise between religion and science.38 Of these sec- ondary works of fiction, the most important his- torically is Mrs. Humphrey Ward's Robert Elsmere (1888); the most literary, W. H. White's Autobiography of Mark Rutherford (1881), and the best known to posterity, Charles Kingsley's Water Babies (1863). Kingsley there enunciated his own doctrine of moral evolution: trout de- generated from salmon because they lost the moral courage to return to the sea. Because truth is stranger than fiction, science has long been the stepmother of romance and fantasy. As the new world of the microscope may have suggested L-illiput to Swift. so the old world of the remote geological past suggested to Jules Verne his enormously popular Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864): clearly, a few common coins of scientific fact could purchase in romance an infinite wealth of excitement, vividness, and verisimilitude. Within four decades, in the work of Watson, De Mille, Du Maurier, Bulwer-Lytton, Allen, and many others, a voluminous popular literature had grown up, drawing prestige from science and in turn con- ferring prestige upon it. Nineteenth-century man journeyed to the remote future and the remote past-freaks, missing links, Martians, and para- gons of the future appeared in the capitals of the 38Henkin, Leo J., Darwinism it the Entglish novel, 1860-1910, the impact of evolution on Victorian fiction, 76, New York, Corporate Press, 1940.</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 103, NO. 5, 19591 INFLUENCE OF DARWIN ON LITERATURE 627 nineteenth century-always to have adventures, sometimes to pronounce a few words of comment or wisdom. Based on an early biological training obtained under Huxley at the South Kensington Normal School, H. G. Wells rocketed or time- machined himself into the Old Stone Age or the distant future, and from the earth to the moon or from Mars to the earth, to popularize-some- times incidentally and sometimes more deliberately iscoveries in anthropology and geology, and the principles of evolution and natural selection, as well as his own socialism partly inspired by "Evolution and Ethics," and his own eugenical ideas partly suggested by Darwin and Galton. A generation later, Aldous Huxley drew on the double tradition of the scientific romance and the inverted utopia to produce, in 1932, his delight- fully satiric Brave New World. Pursuing mainly the implications of the American scene in the twenties, he describes a society of mass production and mass happiness which may have seemed depressing twenty-five years ago, but now, with the threat of universal communism and atomic destruction, seems positively optimistic. Meanwhile, Thackeray had investigated the follies of idle young men, and Dickens the venalities of lawyers and the greed of Philistines, with scarcely a hint that The Origin of Species had ever been written. In her habits of detached observation and in her elaborate psychological and moral realism stressing the importance of environment and the logical sequence of motives, George Eliot may reflect her reading in Darwin and other scientific writers and critics. Yet, so far as subject matter is concerned, one is struck by her reticence more than anything else. Ideas entered the upper regions of fiction in force when two thwarted poets, Meredith and Hardy, at- tempted success in a more popular genre. Several of Meredith's novels seem to involve his evolu- tionary scheme, and The Egoist in particular finds some of its comedy, and more of its serious significance, in Darwin's principle of sexual selec- tion. In their suggestion of an indifferent uni- verse or a hostile deity, in their determinism of environmental influence, overwhelming passion, and adverse coincidence, Hardy's novels reveal even more clearly his pessimistic evolutionism. They also sometimes use science to reduce human significance to the vanishing point. Two in a Tower transpires under the crushing immensity of interstellar space; A Pair of Blue Eyes opens out, at a critical moment, on the equally crushing immensity of geological time. Again, both Mere- dith and Hardy are Darwinian in their willingness to discuss unpleasant subjects, such as the animal instincts, or the legal inferiority of women. In 1872, Samuel Butler, an eccentric bachelor fascinated with The Origin of Species, published a compact little utopian satire called Erewhon, in which he set the Victorian Age so precisely on its head that it seemed, from certain angles, to assume a posture of extraordinary common sense. Apparently, one of the most sensible things the Erewhonians had done was to destroy all ma- chines. Assuming a degree of consciousness in everything and arguing from appearances to rational self-interest, their apologist had made a convincing case that since machines show many signs of intelligence, they may one day gain full consciousness and become the masters of men. In reply, another Erewhonian had unsuccessfully maintained that machines were simply extra limbs which man has developed and which therefore raise him in the evolutionary scale. The reason- ing particularly of the second Erewhonian is in many ways suggestive of Marx. After Erewhon, Butler seized on another idea implicit in his whole discussion of evolution: what if living organs were machines? He quickly saw that in a fumbling, trial-and-error sort of way, animals might "invent" their organs through need, improve them through use, maintain them through habit, and pass them on through unconscious memory. Butler explained his theory in a series of clever books and finally illustrated it in a remarkable novel, The Way of All Flesh. By assuming purpose in the first place, he had restored a kind of incremental, cumulative purpose to evolu- tion. Paradoxically, his purposive evolution led him to celebrate, even in civilized men, the ad- vantages of an instinctive, unreflecting wisdom. In The Way of All Flesh, Butler demonstrated that his particular kind of evolution was a power- ful chemical with which to destroy Victorian ideas and conventions. Bernard Shaw carried the des- truction much further and, exercising his super- lative genius for pumping intellectual significance into the cliches of a comic plot, used creative evolution to propound theories not only of ethics and education, but-with some assistance from Darwin and Marx-of history, love, and future human evolution. Shaw's long career embraces both the rise of evolutionary thought to its most</page><page sequence="13">628 WILLIAM IRVINE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. elaborate literary expression in Back to Methu- selah (1921), and its rapid decline before the awful immediacies of fascism and communism. To sum up, Darwinism undermined orthodox religion by undermining Genesis, and undermined all theism by placing the whole question of the existence of life on the planet in a light pro- foundly uncongenial to the humanitarian con- science. An inspiration to both Marx and Freud, Darwin was one of the first, and probably the most important of those thinkers who flooded the Victorian mind with unpleasant realities until it gradually ceased to be Victorian. At the end of the nineteenth century, a desperate and disil- lusioned romanticism brooded gloomily over the wreck of Victorian hopes, and danced gaily on the altars of Victorian convention. A notable decline in faith in the supernatural created a vacuum which was soon filled by the great secular religions of fascism and communism, which also owed a debt to Darwin. Literature has ceased to be much preoccupied with Darwin himself, but it is deeply preoccupied with a world which he, as much as any man, has brought about.</page></plain_text>
