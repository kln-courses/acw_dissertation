THE primitive Greek king, as I showed in my last paper,' was the human representative of the sky-god Zeus, and in that capacity was not only called by his name but also believed to act as his vice-gerent. Thus he was expected to control the sun and to feed its flames, partly by kindling periodic bonfires on a mountain-top, partly by maintaining a perpetual fire on his own hearth. Again, he was rain- maker for the district, and could, when he so desired, evoke a sudden thunder-storm. Further, he was responsible for the crops, and to him all eyes turned as often as the fruits of the earth were injured by drought or blight. It must not, of course, be supposed that these were the sole obligations of the king. The accepted classification of his functions is that propounded by Aristotle,2 who saw Folk-Lore, xv., 299 ff. 2 Aristot.joL, 3. 14. 1285 b. 22, oarparnyo' rE y p Iyv cai ricaTar 6 gaaXe wal r~tV rpbc robc Oeoc 0 bpco'C, ib., 1285 b. 9, vp o 6' iaeav r 6i re6 ard 2B</page><page sequence="2">370 The European Sky-god. in him at once a general, a judge, and a priest. It is, however, probable that we ought to invert the Aristotelian order and to regard the early king as primarily a religious personage,3 secondarily charged with judicial and military duties. Indeed, it would appear that his office as judge, if not also his office as general, was a direct consequence of his office as the accredited representative of Zeus. He was judge, that is to say, because he spoke with the voice and authority of Zeus.4 In the Iliad Nestor addresses Agamemnon as follows: "Most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, with thy name will I end, and in thine begin,5 for that thou art king of many peoples, and in the hollow of thy hand hath Zeus placed a sceptre and judgments to the end that thou mayest decide for them. Therefore more than others must thou speak thy thought and hearken, yea and fulfil even another man's advice, whensoever his mind biddeth him speak for good; for whatever any doth begin will hinge on thee."6 Note that 'r6XELOv ?(Etovlta rcati rv OvtYwv, bat pt) LeparLcai, cai trpb TroVrotS re~ Bircac icpevov ; cp. a fragment of Diotogenes 7repi paaeXelag, a Pythagorean treatise, cited by Stobaeus in hisflorilegium, 48. 61, Epya  paactXEw rpia r6 rE arparfvl v cal atcaacroXYv ixai Epa7rE~v Oev o ....

Thou hast given them cities to guard : yea thou satest thyself in citadels, watching them that governed their folk with crooked decisions and them that were upright." ' Dr. W. Leaf ad loc. justly observes : " Nestor begins his speech in the usual style of an appeal to a god; because a king is the representative of Zeus. So " A te principium, tibi desinet," Verg. Ecl., viii., ii." 6 11.,9 96 iff.</page><page sequence="3">The European Sky-god. 371 Agamemnon as judge7 bears the sceptre of Zeus. This was an oaken staff or spear (86pv) of peculiar sanctity, as we gather from the account of it given by Pausanias: 8 "The god whom the Charoneans honour most is the sceptre which Homer says Hephestus made for Zeus, and Zeus gave to Hermes, and Hermes to Pelops, and Pelops bequeathed to Atreus, and Atreus to Thyestes, from whom Agamemnon had it. This sceptre they worship, naming it a spear; and that there is something divine about it is proved especially by the distinction it confers on its owners. .... There is no public temple built for it, but the man who acts as priest keeps the sceptre in his house for the year; and sacrifices are offered to it daily, and a table is set beside it covered with all sorts of flesh and cakes." Now C. B*tticher9 has proved from this and analogous usages elsewhere that a tree-god was often represented by a sceptre, or lance, or staff. It may be regarded as certain, therefore, that the royal sceptre, which conferred the right of judgment, was simply a conven- tionalised form of the oak of Zeus :10 hence both in literature 7 Cp.

Agamemnon promises that the people shall honour Achilles "with offerings like a god, and beneath his sceptre shall fulfil his bright judgments." Od., I I. 568 f., describes " Minos, the brilliant son of Zeus," as " holding a golden sceptre and passing judgment on the dead." In Ap. Rhod., 4. 1176 ff., Alcinous " held in his hand the golden sceptre of justice, whereby many a man in the town had righteous judgment given him." 8 Paus., 9. 40.

El., 417 ff., Jebb: "'Tis said that she beheld our sire (Agamemnon), restored to the sunlight, at her side once more; then he took the sceptre-once his own, but now borne by Aegisthus-and planted it at the hearth; and thence a fruitful bough sprang upward, wherewith the whole land of Mycenae was overshadowed.' 2B2</page><page sequence="4">372 The European Sky-god. and in art" it was sometimes surmounted by an eagle, the bird of Zeus. When the Homeric chiefs were assembled, he and he only might declare his opinion to whom the herald had handed the sceptre.1" Very significant is the language used of it by Achilles: " But I will speak out to thee and therewith swear a mighty oath. Yea, by this sceptre, which shall never put forth leaves and branches, having once left its cloven stock'upon the mountains, no, nor flourish again; for the bronze hath trimmed its leaves and bark round about, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear it in their hands, even they that exercise justice, who guard the judgments given by Zeus. Hereby will I swear thee a mighty oath."13 Even in the Periclean age it was still the custom for the Athenian archon to assign the numerous judges to their respective courts by means of acorns (3daXavot) and staves (3aKcrrp'at), of which the former were marked with various letters, the latter with various colours.14 Have we not here a survival of the sacred oak which, as the oracular tree of Zeus, conferred juridical rights on the Pelasgian king ? It would seem that as general too the king stood in some special relation to Zeus. This comes out most clearly in the case of the Spartan kings, who were priests of Zeus Aaice8alwov and Zeus OOvpa6togS. Before starting on a military expedition they sacrificed to Zeus 'AyrjyrTp, Zeus " An eagle was perched on the sceptre not only of Zeus (Pind. Pyth., I. 6, Paus., 5. I 1.

For Roman parallels see Juv., 10. 43, and Mayor's n. Gold coins of Coso, king of Thrace, struck in 42 B.c., show an eagle holding a wreath with one claw and a sceptre with the other (Brit. Mus. Cat.

Similarly the kings of Epirus used to sacrifice to Zeus "Apetos, Zeus "the Warlike," at Passaron in the territory of Molottis,8s as Oenomaus king of Pisa had done in mythical times.19 During the fight the king might be armed with the spear that symbolised his god:20 at least, Par- thenopaus of Arcadia, who seems to have boasted that he was the son of Zeus, "swears by the spear that he holds, trusting it more than a god for sacredness and better than sight.'"21 If Zeus "the dispenser of war "22 favoured him and he proved successful against the foe, he23 would erect a trophy, i.e., an oak-tree24 lopped of its branches and covered with votive armour. This oaken trunk was regarded as a rough statue of Zeus Tpo'railos, Zeus "the god of Rout.'"25 It appears, then, that various duties towards 16 Xen. de rep. Lac., 13. 2; Nicol. Dam., irap' EO ov af.

Zeus devolved upon the king as military leader. Possibly he owed his position at the head of the army to this very fact. If so, we may subscribe to the opinion long since put forward by Fr. Creuzer,26 viz.: that Zeus was the source of every honour enjoyed by the king. The ancients in any case did well to personify Kingship as the daughter of Zeus.27 The duties of the king as representative of Zeus could be satisfactorily discharged only by a man who was perfect and without blemish, by a man-that is-in the prime of life suffering from no defect of body or mind. The kings of the heroic age were in fact conspicuous for their physical powers. Achilles, for example, is known to fame as " swift of foot," Hector as "tamer of horses," Diomedes and Mene- laus as "good at the war-cry." Moreover, it was well understood that the decay of bodily strength would involve a corresponding loss of authority. Hence the anxiety with which Achilles in the under-world asks about his father's health: " Tell me of Peleus free from blemish 2 (I8 ' ovo4), if aught thou hast heard, whether he still keepeth his traaavr pi-rag, suppl. 647 f, ir- y&amp;p rpodraTa ZYvbC" AlyiC rocow I a6rqaEV o7 re eavpqEraaX6v76 copd6; On the cult of Zeus Tpo7raZoc at Sparta and in Salamis see Preller-Robert, p. 140, n. 3; and on that of Zeus Tpo7raLtoGXo in Pamphylia, Farnell, Cults, i. 164. 26 Creuzer, Symbolik 3, iii., IO8, " Als K6nig ist er auch Urquelle von allen Ki'nigsrechten," quoting Aesch.

If the word was originally, as I suppose, a ceremonial term applicable to the priestly king, fresh significance is given to Odysseus' speech in Od., 19. og9 ff. : " Even as a king without blemish, who ruleth god-fearing over many mighty men and maintaineth justice, while the black earth beareth wheat and barley, and the trees are laden with fruit, and the flocks bring forth without fail, and the sea yieldeth her fish by reason of his good rule, and the folk prosper beneath him."

How Diopeithes pressed these lines against the claims of the lame Agesilaus, while Lysander insisted that they were an allegorical condemnation of the bastard Leotychides, is matter of common knowledge. It is also on record 32 that Archidamus, the father of Agesilaus, was fined by the ephors for having married too short a wife: "' for,' said they, 'she will bear us not kings but kinglets.'" At Athens the last of the regular kings was Codrus; and Pausanias 33 ~ propos of his successor mentions an instruct- ive incident. " Medon and Nileus, the eldest of the sons of Codrus, quarrelled about the sovereignty, and Nileus declared that he would not endure to be ruled by Medon, because Medon was lame of one leg. They agreed to refer the question to the Delphic oracle, and the Pythian priestess gave the kingdom of Athens to Medon. So Nileus and the rest of the sons of Codrus set out to found a colony." 4 In course of time the duties of the Athenian king as priest, general, and judge passed into the hands of the priestly king (/ao-Aetgl), the war-leader (7roXet'apXo9), and the 29 Od., I I. 494 ff- 30 Xen.

But it is noteworthy that all these officials, like the king before them, had to be men "without blemish" (X0XcKXpot).35 And that this was not merely a matter of decency or decorum, but rather a religious requirement, is made probable by the fact that the victims 36 offered to the gods and the priests37 who served them had likewise to be "without blemish," and are described by the same term The community in early days had a simple method of securing the best man for the post of king. The king reigned till a stronger than he arose and slew him. This primitive rule may be traced in several of the Greek myths. Philostratus38 describes how the Phlegyae chose Phorbas as their king " because he was the biggest and most ferocious man in the tribe." He dwelt apart under an oak-tree, which was regarded as his palace (/3aoa-ieta); and the Phlegywe resorted to him for judgment. This oak grew on the road to Delphi, and Phorbas terrorised the Delphic pilgrims.39 Old men and children he sent on to the 3 Phot. s. v. bXd'xXpoc ' of ApXovrreg h8oxtpovTO Ed X6KXlPOt EUil'V MEvavapog erraXp' (Meineke, frag. com.

Wayfarers in the prime of life he challenged to an athletic contest, wrestling or running or the pancratium or quoit- throwing; and, having vanquished them, he cut off their heads and hung them on his oak, where they swung dripping in the wind-a ghastly sight. When he prided himself on the result of these Olympic sports (TaZE 'OXvu~wtro-t TraVTaq), Apollo took upon him the form of a youthful boxer and smote the ogre to the ground, while a thunderbolt from the sky blasted his oak. The place where it stood was called the Oak-Heads (Apvb K ce aXal). From Hero- dotus'40 and Thucydides41 we gather that it was a pass of Mt. Cithaeron on the way from Athens to Plataea, and that the Bceotians named it the Three Heads (TpeiZ KeieaXai). The same story was told by the cyclic poets, who laid stress on the pride of Phorbas: " By reason of his overweening conceit he was minded to pose as the peer of the gods themselves; wherefore Apollo drew near and, standing up to him, slew him."42 There can, I think, be little doubt that Phorbas was a king who personated an oak-god 3 and, in accordance with the primitive rule, defended his title against all comers. A somewhat similar figure is Cycnus, son of Ares, who established himself in Thessaly and waylaid travellers on the road from Tempe to Thermopyla. With their skulls he was building a temple to Apollo, when Heracles, whom he challenged to a single combat, shot him."

He forced all strangers to wrestle with him and slew them, when they were thrown, till at last he was himself thrown by Theseus.49 Antaus, a gigantic Libyan king, likewise forced all strangers to wrestle with him, and killed them when thrown. With their skulls he, like Cycnus, built a temple to his father Poseidon. In the end Heracles met him on his own ground and slew him.50 His grave was shown at Tingis in Mauretania; and we are told that, whenever a hole was made in it, rain fell till the hole was filled up again.51 Amycus king of the Bebryces compelled all strangers to box with him, and thus killed many of them before he was himself beaten and killed by Polydeuces: 52 so pugnacious was he that who- ever held a branch of the great laurel-tree called the Mad Laurel, which grew on his grave, broke out at once into abusive language.53 Another test of physical endurance 5 Hes. sc., 354 ff., 472. 47 Hes. sc., 477 ff. 46 Folk-Lore xv., 300o. * Apollod., 2. 5.

But it is noticeable that in these and other similar stories the victor may take the wife, or more often the daughter, of the vanquished to be his wife, and that sometimes at least he receives the kingdom along with her. Theseus, after he had slain Cercyon, gave the kingdom (which must there- fore have been his by right of conquest) to Hippothous, whom Cercyon's daughter Alope had born to Poseidon,55 but himself consorted with Alope.56 So Heracles, when he had thrown Anteus, had intercourse with his wife Iphinoe 7 or Tinge,s8 whose son Sophax became king of the country. According to Pindar,59 Anteus had a fair daughter-Alceis or Barce, the scholiast 60 calls her-who was wooed by many of her kinsmen and by many strangers too. "But her father gained for his daughter a marriage more glorious still. Now he had heard how sometime Danaos 61 at Argos devised for his forty and eight maiden daughters, ere mid-day was upon them, a wedding of utmost speed-for he straightway set the whole company at the race-course end, and bade determine by a foot-race which maiden each hero should have, of all the suitors that 5' Poll., 4. 54.

Even on this wise gave the Libyan a bride- groom to his daughter, and joined the twain. At the line he set the damsel, having arrayed her splendidly, to be the goal and prize, and proclaimed in the midst that he should lead her thence to be his bride who, dashing to the front, should first touch the robes she wore. Thereon Alexi- damos, when that he had sped through the swift course, took by her hand the noble maiden, and led her through the troops of Nomad horsemen. Many the leaves and wreaths they showered on him; yea and of former days many plumes of victories had he won." Similarly tradi- tion said " that Icarius set the wooers of Penelope to run a race." 62 Odysseus won it, and so gained his bride. The Bceotian Atalanta, daughter of Schceneus, was awarded by her father to the man who should outstrip her in a foot- race. The wooer was to run without weapons; Atalanta would follow with a spear, and if she caught him before the goal would slay him and fix his head on the racecourse. When she had vanquished and slain many suitors, she was at last outrun by Hippomenes, who dropped the famous golden apples in her path and so delayed her.63 How tales of this type are related to tales that represent the king as himself challenging all comers, appears from the legend of Sithon.4 This king of the Thracian Odo- manti was the son of Poseidon (or Ares 65). When his daughter Pallene was wooed by many from far and wide, he bade each suitor fight him for the girl; on condition that if he were unsuccessful he should be put to death, but if successful he should receive not only his bride but the kingdom also. On these terms he defeated and put to death Merops, king of Anthemus, Periphetes, king of 62 Paus., 3. 12. I 0 Hyg. fab., 185, cp. Apollod., 3. 9. 2.

At length, when he was not so strong as he used to be, he changed his rule and ordained that in future the suitors should contend with each other, not with him,-the penalty and the prize to be as before. Hereupon two suitors presented themselves, Dryas66 and Clitus. Pallene herself favoured Clitus; and an old servitor of hers induced the charioteer of Dryas to remove the linch- pins of his master's chariot before the fray. Consequently, when Dryas drove against Clitus, his wheels came off: he fell, and was run over and killed by Clitus. Sithon, on realising his daughter's deceit, built a huge funeral pyre for Dryas, and was minded to slay Pallene upon it. But, according to one account,67 Aphrodite appeared by night to all the townsfolk, and so rescued the maiden; according to another,68 some portent and a sudden downfall of rain made Sithon change his mind. Anyhow, he prepared a wedding- feast for the Thracians who were present, and bestowed Pallene upon Clitus. At Sithon's death they succeeded to his kingdom. Nonnus69 makes Dionysus demand Pallene of Sithon, who bids him wrestle with her. He is victorious and claims his prize; but, shocked at the skulls of the suitors with which the palace is adorned, slays the impious Sithon with a blow of his thyrsus. This version of the myth is probably later than the other: but in any case the whole tale furnishes a doublet to that of Oenomaus. The latter is thus told in the Epitome of Apollodorus.70 Oeno- maus, king of Pisa, had a daughter Hippodamia, for whose hand he instituted a contest on the following terms. The suitor was to take Hippodamia on his chariot and flee to the Isthmus of Corinth. Oenomaus, clad in armour and 6 The name is appropriate : it was natural for the " Oak "-man (Apiac) to claim the kingdom. See Class.

In this way he slew a dozen or more suitors, and nailed their heads to his house.72 When Pelops came to try his luck, Hippodamia fell in love with him and per- suaded Myrtilus, the charioteer of Oenomaus, not to insert the linch-pins of his master's car. Oenomaus was thrown and, being entangled in the reins, was dragged along and killed or, according to others, was despatched by Pelops, who thereby won his bride and became king of Pisa. Now we may be very sure that romantic attachment, which in Alexandrine times-if not earlier-became the principal feature in these folk-tales, had originally nothing to do with them. If the young hero married the old king's daughter, it was merely in order to confirm his claim to the throne by obtaining a native sanction, so to speak, for the foreign successor.7a The myths of Sithon and Oenomaus contain at least a hint of the real motive. The adventurer might gain the kingdom by a display of personal prowess. That was his object from first to last; and tales of the bride-race, no less than tales of the king's challenge to all strangers, presuppose the primitive rule that the king must be the strongest man of the district. Another constant element in these stories is the death- penalty affixed to the would-be king who cannot beat his opponent in the fight or wrestling-match or race. This again takes us back to primitive times, when the king who 't Diod., 4. 73. See further the vase-paintings figured and discussed in Class. Rev., xvii., 271 f. 72 Schol. rec. Pind. OL, I. 114, states that Oenomaus was constructing a temple to Ares with the skulls of the suitors. This is supported by Tzetz. in Lyc. Alex., 159 ; but may be a trait borrowed from the myth of Cycnus (supra, p. 377) or from that of Antaeus (ib.). 72 Dr. Frazer tells me that he has investigated at some length the question of the succession to the kingdom in classical antiquity and is about to publish his results in the forthcomng third edition of the Golden Bough.</page><page sequence="15">The European Sky-god. 383 was unequal to his duties used to be slain without mercy. Since old age is inevitable, it would appear that in remote times all priestly kings or human Zeuses must have been doomed to die a violent death. That this, however im- probable it sounds to modern ears, was actually the case, is one of the main conclusions reached by Dr. Frazer in his Golden Bough.73 He shows by a multitude of examples collected from widely separated lands that it has been the almost universal custom to kill the king as soon as he showed the first signs of advancing age, " in order that the divine spirit, incarnate in him, might be transferred in unabated vigour to his successor."74 Of this barbaric custom traces can be detected even on Greek soil. In primis I would cite the valuable evidence of Macrobius. That writer is commenting on the passage in which Virgil describes the death of Halesus: 75 Halaesus' sire the future feared, And 'mid the woods his darling reared: When death had glazed the old man's eyes, The ruthless Parcae claimed their prize, Laid their cold finger on his heart, And marked him for Evander's dart. Now, poising long his lance in air, To Tiber Pallas made his prayer : 'Grant, Tiber sire, the spear I throw Through strong Halaesus' breast may go : The spoils and armour of the foe Shall deck thy sacred oak.' 'Tis heard ; and while Halaesus shields Imaon's breast, his own he yields Unguarded to the stroke. Virgil, it will be seen, relates the combat between Pallas and Halesus in language appropriate to the monomachia of an ancient oak-king.

For whatever is destined for the gods is called sacred (sacrum) : but the soul cannot reach them unless it be freed from the incumbrance of the body, and this liberation can be effected only through death. Hence he aptly uses the word sacrare of Halesus, who was doomed to die. Indeed in this passage he strictly follows the terminology of laws both human and divine. His phrase ' laid their finger on him' (iniecere manum) amounts to a mention of legal emancipation (mancipium), while his use of the word sacrare satisfies the requirements of religion. And here I may refer to the condition of those men whom the laws would consecrate to particular deities; for some persons, I know, feel surprised at the rule, which forbids us to injure consecrated things, but bids us put to death a consecrated man. The reason of it is this. The ancients would not allow any consecrated animal to remain within their own boundaries, but drove them into the boundaries of those gods, to whom they were consecrated; whereas the souls of consecrated men, whom the Greeks call Zanes, they regarded as owed to the gods.77 So the consecrated thing that could not actually be sent to the gods they did not hesitate to send away from themselves, while the con. 76 Macrob.

The custom is discussed by Trebatius in the ninth book of his Religiones. I omit what he says, for fear of being tedious. If anyone desires to read it, let him be content with this indication of the author and the reference." Unhappily the works of Trebatius, great jurist though he was and warm friend of Cicero to boot, have perished.78 We must be content with what Macrobius tells us, viz. : that the consecrated men whom the Greeks called Zanes, i.e., Zeuses, were put to death as a sacrifice to the gods. If in the light of this statement we reconsider the examples of kings called Zeus that I have already cited,79 it is inter- esting to observe how frequently they are said to have been slain or metamorphosed by Zeus. Salmoneus, king of Elis, who claimed to be Zeus, was killed by the thunderbolt of Zeus.s0 Ceyx, whose wife called him Zeus, was changed by Zeus into the sea-bird ceyx.s8 Polytechnus, who com- pared himself to Zeus, was transformed by Zeus into a wood-pecker.82 A similar fate overtook Periphas, the early king of Attica. His story, as told by Antoninus Liberalis,83 is worth quoting at length: "Periphas was an Attic autochthon before the days of Cecrops the son of Ge. He became king of the ancient population, and was just and rich and holy, a man who offered many sacrifices to Apollo and judged many disputes and was blamed by no one. All men willingly submitted to his rule and, in view of his surpassing deeds, transferred to him the honours due to Zeus and decided that they belonged to Periphas.84 They '7 On him see M.

Indignant at this, Zeus wished to consume his whole house with a thunderbolt. But when Apollo, whom Periphas used to honour exceedingly, begged Zeus not to destroy him utterly, Zeus granted the request. He came into the home of Periphas and found him embracing his wife. Grasping them both in his hands, he turned Periphas into an eagle (alefros); his wife, who begged him to make her too a bird to bear Periphas company, into a vulture (fvyr). So upon Periphas he bestowed honours in return for his holy life among men, making him king over all the birds, and granting him to guard the sacred sceptre, and to draw near to his own throne; while Periphas' wife he turned into a vulture, and suffered to appear as a good omen to men in all their doings." In short, it appears that terrestrial Zeuses were either killed or, more often, metamorphosed into birds by the celestial Zeus. Is not this a trace of the primitive belief that the life of the divine king was forfeit to the god whom he represented ? The full meaning of these transformations into birds cannot here be investigated.8- But I would suggest that republican Athens, during his year of office, sat in the Royal Colonnade (Paus., I. 3. I), which was dedicated to Zeus BaaLX6vC (Hesych., s. v. paatXLoc anrod).

Thus Dryops the " Wood-pecker " (aptop) was the eponym of the Dryopes or Wood- pecker tribe: see Class Rev., xviii., 83. Phlegyas the "Eagle" (OXEyvaa) was the eponym of the Phlegyae or Eagle tribe. Pelasgus, the eponym of the Pelasgians, may have been a " Stork ": for the word 7reXacy6c appears in the Eretrian dialect as 7rEXapyk6 (G. Meyer Griech.

Aegypius the Thessalian was dear to the gods on account of his piety; to men, on account of his nobility and justice. He consorted with a certain widow Timandra, whose son Neophron, disliking it, treated Bulis, the mother of Aegypius, in the same way, and even contrived that Aegypius should lie with Bulis in mistake for Timandra. When the facts were discovered, Bulis caught up a sword and would have blinded her son with it and slain herself, while Aegypius looked towards heaven and prayed that he and all con- cerned might vanish. Hereupon Zeus changed them into birds. Aegypius became a vulture (alyvrwOt6); Neophron, a smaller vulture of different colour; Bulis, another bird (Or-c^wry); Timandra, a titmouse (alylOaXXoq).91 Again, when Anthus, the son of Autonous and Hippodamia, was devoured by his father's horses,92 Zeus and Apollo out of pity for his fate turned the whole family into birds-Auto- nous into a kind of heron (b'Ivog), Hippodamia into a lark (icopV~86), Anthus into a bird that imitates the neighing of a horse (itv09o), his brothers Erodius, Schoeneus, and Acanthus into a heron (Cpo6L6S), a wagtail (oXotviXoX), and a linnet or goldfinch (K/cav'iOs), his sister Acanthyllis into a hen-linnet.93 Similarly certain Cretans, who attempted to 89 Pauly-Wissowa, iii., 633 f. 90 lb., i., 2572 f. 91 Ant.

Laius was king of Thebes and perhaps passed for a human Zeus.9 Celeus was the first king at Eleusis.Y6 Another source used by Antoninus Liberalis was Nicander's 'Erepotopeva, a didactic epic on changes into animal and plant forms.97 From it he bor- rowed the following tale.9" Munichus, son of Dryas, was king and seer of the Molossi. He had by his wife Lelante a son Alcander, who was a better seer than himself, besides two other sons, Megaletor and Phileus, and a daughter Hyperippe. When robbers attacked them by night and burnt their house, Zeus in pity changed them all into birds. Munichus became a buzzard (TrptPXfql), Lelante a wood- pecker of the sort that chops at an oak for insects (rt'7rt'r), their sons Alcander, Megaletor, and Phileus, a wren (8pXiXo1),99 and two small birds (IXvev'.ov and icvov), their daughter Hyperippe a large gull (at'Ovta).

Thus the soul of Agamemnon, according to Plato,100 became an eagle. His sceptre, according to Aristophanes and the scholiast,101 had an eagle perched upon it; and, as Pausanias 102 states, was handed down from one member of the divine dynasty to another. Other early kings, such as Merops103 son of Triopas the Coan, and Periclynienus104 son of Neleus the Pylian, were transformed into eagles. And the eagle appears repeatedly as a portent in connexion with several lines of historical kings. Coins of Alexander the Great and his successors represent Zeus seated on a throne with an eagle in his right hand, a sceptre in his left.105 On the day when Alexander was born two eagles perched on the roof of his father's house, " an omen of his two-fold rule over Europe and Asia."106 Ptolemy Soter was exposed as an infant on a bronze shield; and a Mace- donian tradition declared that an eagle hovering over him had by the spread of its wings protected him against sun and rain, driving off birds of prey and feeding him on the blood of quails.107 Coins of the Ptolemaic dynasty regularly symbolise the reigning sovereign as an eagle, or the sovereign and his consort as a pair of eagles.10s Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, kept a tame eagle which on the death of its o00 Plat. rep., 620 B. 101 Aristoph. av., 51o, with schol. ad loc.

All these facts, unless I am mistaken, hang together with the belief that the soul of the monarch appeared as an eagle, and in this form watched over the fortunes of his empire. The regalia handed down from king to king represented the sacred foliage as a wreath or crown, the sacred tree as a sceptre,122 and the sacred bird as an eagle perched upon it. But, to return from our digression, we have seen that in Greece as elsewhere the divine king was probably doomed to die as soon as his physical strength gave way. With increasing civilisation this barbaric rule was to some extent relaxed. Dr. Frazer, who first formulated it, has discussed various modifications of it, such as the sacri- fice of the king's son or of a criminal in place of the king himself."12 Greek examples of these mitigations are not wanting. It will be remembered, for instance, that the Edoni put their king, the " man-god " (dcvOpworo8aiuwwv) Lycurgus, to death because their land remained barren."12 Dr. Frazer125 points out that a modification of this rule is well attested in the case of King Athamas, the brother of Salmoneus. His story was told by Sophocles as follows.126 Athamas had two children, Phrixus and Helle, by the cloud- goddess Nephele. Afterwards he married a mortal woman, and Nephele out of jealousy sent a drought upon his land. Envoys despatched to the Pythian Apollo were bribed by '20 Diod., 17. 115.

This he was about to do,127 when a ram speaking with human voice warned them of their danger and they fled along with the ram. Helle fell off its back into the sea and gave her name to the Hellespont; but Phrixus got safely to Colchis and sacrificed the ram to Ares or Hermes. Meantime Athamas himself was garlanded like a victim and led out to be sacrificed. In the nick of time he was rescued by Heracles. Herod- otus128 further informs us that at Alus in Thessaly Athamas was said to have been saved by the arrival of Cytisorus, the son of Phrixus, from Colchis-an intervention which drew down the wrath of Zeus AaOnv-rtoo upon his descendants. The eldest son of the family had to refrain from entering the prytaneum. "Should he enter it, he must not leave it till he is about to be sacrificed."129 Many of those who were thus condemned to die had fled the country in terror. It is tolerably certain that here we have an example of the king's death being commuted into the death of the king's son. In other places a stranger or a prisoner was substi- tuted. When the land of Egypt remained barren for nine years, Phrasius, a Cyprian seer, told King Busiris that the famine could be stayed, if he would sacrifice a stranger to Zeus every year. Busiris promptly began by sacrificing Phrasius himself and afterwards other strangers who visited the country. Heracles, when he came thither, was gar- landed and led out to the altar of Zeus: but, turning on his captors, he slew them all, including Busiris and his son Iphidamas or Amphidamas.180 127 Pherecydes ap. schol.

At Priene a young man was appointed as king (83at"LXe61) to offer the sacrifices at the Panionian festival: he pre- sumably held office during the festival only, or at most for the year.'31 At Chaeronea the man who kept the sceptre of Zeus, and was therefore priestly king, had it in his house "for the year."132 At Athens the king (3athXed'), who in early days was called Zeus,133 gave judgment in the Royal Colonnade for a year.134 At Megara and in various other towns of Greece135 the eponymous magistrate bearing the title p3ao-Lxevi was probably a priestly king, whose reign lasted but a twelvemonth. Elsewhere the tenure of the office was longer, but still of limited duration. The Greeks, in their attempt to reconcile the lunar with the solar year, advanced progressively from a " great year" of twenty-four months (rpLerTqpi'), through one of forty-eight (T'reP-rE-7ptl), to one of ninety-six (e'vvee-rqpl~.). This last-mentioned period, as Censorinus186 remarks, figured largely in Greek 13' Strab. 384. See Class. Rev., xvii., 415- 132 Paus., 9. 40. 12. '33 Supra, p. 385, with n. 84. 134 Paus., I. 3.

Among other things it fixed the length of the king's tether. "As . .. the dignity of the kings," says C. O. Muller,187 " was founded on a religious notion, so it was also limited by religion, although the account we have is rather of an ancient custom, that was retained when its meaning had been lost, than an institution of real influence. Once in every eight years (3&amp;' &amp;0iPv &amp;vv a) the ephors chose a calm and moonless night, and placed themselves in the most profound silence to observe the heavens: if there was any appearance of a shooting star, it was believed that the kings had in some manner offended the Deity, and they were suspended until an oracle from Delphi, or the priests at Olympia, absolved them from the guilt.138 If this custom . . .is compared with the frequent occurrence of this period of nine years in early times,'19 and especially with the tradition preserved in a verse of Homer,140 ' of Minos, who reigned for periods of nine years, holding intercourse with Jupiter,' it is easy to perceive that the dominion of the ancient Doric princes determined, as it were, at the period of every eight years, and required a fresh religious ratification. So intimate in early times was the connexion between government and religion." The case of Minos merits more than a passing mention. Tradition said that at the expiration of each period of eight years he repaired to the cave on Mount Ida for a personal interview with Zeus, who then communicated '" C. O. Miiller op. cit., ii., 104.

This custom he is said to have borrowed from a more ancient ruler, Rhada- manthys by name,142 so that doubtless it was an extremely archaic Cretan institution. It was also every ninth year that the Minotaur received his tribute of human victims,143 a usage which probably implies that the solar powers of the king needed renewal at the same recurring period.44 These examples lead us to conjecture that the restriction of the Athenian kings (19ao-hei) or rulers (apxovTre) from a life tenure, first to ten years, and then to one year,45" was due not merely to political but also to religious motives. A suggestive tale is told about one of the old life-kings named Thymcetes.'46 In a war between the Athenians and Bceotians he was challenged to a single combat by Xanthus, king of Boeotia, but declined the challenge through old age or cowardice and offered his kingdom as a reward to any man who would venture to fight the Bceotian champion. Melanthus the Neleid, a recent immigrant from Messenia, undertook the task and, thanks to divine assistance, succeeded. The throne thus passed from the Theseids to the Neleids, who had proved themselves physically com- petent to reign. But the new dynasty did not remain sans peur et sans reproche for long. Melanthus was followed by a son worthy of him, the heroic Codrus : Codrus' son Medon was lame of one leg and therefore had much ado to 1' Plat.

But even this limited rule was no safeguard against moral degeneration and consequent physical incom- petence. A fragment of Heraclides Ponticus de rebus publicis149 states that the Athenians " ceased to choose their kings from the descendants of Codrus because they appeared to have become enervated through luxurious living," and adds that Hippomenes the Codrid, whom we know to have been one of the ten-year archons,1'o was anxious to vindicate his character against this charge. Aristotle151 likewise asserts that the office of polemarch was instituted " owing to the fact that some of the kings have proved cowardly in warfare." Finally the kingship became an annual magistracy, tenable only by those who were bodily perfect, while the polemarch continued to discharge the military duties once undertaken by the king.152 It is not improbable, therefore, that the gradual restriction in the tenure of the Athenian kings was intimately bound up with the question of their physical competence. However that may be, we have seen that among the Greeks in general two methods of ensuring a satisfactory succession were in vogue. On the one hand, the king as strongest man in the district was expected to challenge all comers to an athletic contest: if vanquished, he yielded his place to the victor, who reigned in his stead. On the other hand, the king might be forced to abdicate at the end of a fixed period, after enjoying his office say for one year, or 147 Supra,p. 375- '1 Busolt, Grieckiscke Geschichte, ii.,2 132 ff. 19 Heracl.

It now occurs to us that a combination of these two methods may well have produced one of the most remarkable and characteristic institutions of ancient Greece, viz., the great public games. I venture to suggest15" that these were at first merely a means of selecting the man best fitted to become the priestly king of the locality in which they were held; and that the enormous importance attached to them is to be explained as due, not to any exaggerated or excessive devotion to athletics, but rather to the religious issues involved in the choice of one who should worthily represent God to men. The greatest of all Greek games were those celebrated at Olympia; and it so happens that at Olympia the evidence in favour of my hypothesis is particularly clear. The earliest king of Elis, according to Pausanias,154 was called Aethlius, " the Prize-winner," a name which presumably implies that he had won the kingdom as the prize in a public contest. He was the father of Endymion, of whom we read'55 "Endymion . . . offered his sons the kingdom as a prize to be won in the race at Olympia," and again156 "Endymion set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the kingdom: Epeus won the race and obtained the kingdom." About a generation after Endymion Pelops, who had already won Pisa from Oenomaus by victory in the famous chariot- race,157 " acquired not only the land of Pisa, but also the border district of Olympia, which he severed from the territory of Epeus,"158 and " celebrated the games in honour of Olympian Zeus in a grander way than all who had gone before him."'15 Later, the claims of Dius and Oxylus were 153 Cp.

When Iphitus renewed the games . . . people had forgotten the ancient customs, and they only gradually remembered them."'61 " Iphitus presided alone over the games, and after Iphitus the descendants of Oxylus did likewise."162 Tradition, therefore, manifestly points to the conclusion that the Olympic games originated in a contest for the post of local king. Further, there are reasons for believing that the Olympic victor or local king at one time posed as a human Zeus. It was in Elis that Salmoneus pretended to be Zeus163: Virgil164 describes him as a victor (ovans) who claimed divine honours; and a fifth-century vase now at Chicago 65 shows him decked with olive sprays and fillets as an Olympic victor, while he brandishes a thunderbolt in his right hand, a sword in his left, apparently as an embodi- ment of Thunderbolt Zeus and Warlike Zeus, two forms of Zeus connected with Oenomaus at Olympia.166 Even in historical times, when "people had forgotten the ancient customs" and the victor no longer carried a thunderbolt, there are indications that he was in effect both king and Zeus. To begin with, he was crowned; and his crown resembled that of Zeus himself,167 being a wreath cut from 160 lb., 5. 4. I f. 161 Lb., 5. 8. 5. 162 lb., 5. 9. 4. 163 Apollod., I. 9. 7., cp.

It is expressly stated (ib., 6) that Oenomaus used to sacrifice on the altar of Warlike Zeus at Olympia, " whenever he was about to engage in a chariot-race with any of the suitors of Hippodamia," i.e., whenever he offered his kingdom and his daughter to the man who should beat him in personal prowess (supira, p. 381 f.). 67 Paus., 5. 1.

He was also adorned with prophylactic fillets and wore a peculiar helmet of honour surmounted by a high spike, &amp;c.171 Not only was he feasted "within the Prytaneum, opposite the chamber in which is the hearth,"172 as though he were the king in his palace; but on his return home he was clad in a mantle which is compared to the royal purple,173 and drawn by white horses174 into the city through a breach in its wall.175 Horace176 in a well-known passage says: There are who joy them in the Olympic strife And love the dust they gather in the course; The goal by hot wheels shunn'd, the famous prize, Exalt them to the gods that rule mankind. Lucian177 speaks in similar terms of the victor as " deemed equal to the gods " (iuo6Oeov vowg61.kevov). And that this was no empty figure of speech is proved by the numerous examples of Olympic victors, who were not merely heroi- fled, but actually deified and worshipped as gods by their '8 Ilb., 5.

Dr. Frazer has suggested to me that the victor, not merely as drawn by white horses, but also as racing in his four-horse car, may have represented the sun-god (Roscher, Lex., i. 2005 ff.) ; and there is much to be said in favour of the suggestion-cp. e.g. Virgil's description of Salmoneus : quattuor hic invectus equis et lampada quassans I per Graium populos mediaeque per Elidis urbem I ibat ovans divumque sibi poscebat honorem (Aen. 6. 587 ff.). 175 Plut. symp., 2. 5, Dio 63. 20, Suet.

Pausanias,182 when discussing the origin of the games at Olympia, makes the singular statement: " Some say that Zeus here wrestled with Cronus himself for the kingdom; others that he held the games in honour of his victory over Cronus." Tzetzess83 preserves a yet more singular legend bearing on the same subject: " Heracles vanquished in battle Augeas king of Elis, the son of Helios and Iphiboe, because he had not received the reward due to him for the cleansing of the byre; and, having sacked Elis, he formed of the spoils thereof a contest in honour of Olympian Zeus and called it the Olympian contest. It was held every four years or, to speak with more precision, every fifty months. The athletes contended in the pentathlon (boxing, 178 Philippus of Crotona heroified (Hdt. 5. 47); Cleomedes of Astypaloea heroified (Paus., 6. 9. 8); Polydamas of Scotussa invoked as healer (Luc. deor. concil., 12); Euthymus of Locri in Italy deified during his life-time (Plin. nat. hist., 7. 152, Paus., 6. 6. Io) ; Theagenes of Thasos worshipped as a god in Thasos and elsewhere (Paus., 6. I I. 8 f., Luc. deor. concil., 12). See Class. Rev., xvii., 275- 179 Paus., 5. 21. 2.

In the first contest ever held Heracles challenged any who would to wrestle with him. When no man dared to do so, Zeus likened himself to a wrestler and faced Heracles. The bout lasted long and was indecisive, till Zeus made himself known to his son." Almost equal in importance to the Olympic festival was that celebrated in the territory of Delphi, the ancient Pytho. Here too there are reasons for thinking that the public contest was originally a method of determining who should be priestly king. These reasons are chiefly con- nected with certain rites performed at Delphi once in every eight years. Plutarch184 states that at intervals of eight years the Delphians held a series of three solemnities (Jvv~crrpl~8a) called the Stepterion,185 the Herol's, and the Charila. The Stepterion was a mimetic representation of the fight between Python and Apollo, and of the god's subsequent flight or pursuit to Tempe: some said that he had fled to obtain purification; others that he had pursued the wounded Python along the sacred road and had come up with it just dead and buried by its son Aix. The Hero's was a sort of drama representing apparently the ascent of Semele from the under-world: a mystic tale, known to the Thyiades, was told concerning it. The Charila 86 too was a ritual performance. The king (flao-rLXe) sat on a throne distributing food to all and sundry. The figure of a virgin called Charila was brought in, held by all in turn, and beaten by the king with his '~ Plut. quest.

The tale told to account for this rite spoke of a certain drought during which the king had failed to provide food for his subjects and had beaten a young girl who begged for it: she had gone away and hanged herself, and famine and disease had followed until the king at the bidding of the Pythian priestess undertook this expiatory sacrifice (tetEP*yt4,vp v rtva KaappW Ovo-la). In order to grasp the meaning of these peculiar ceremonies we must compare a few other passages in which reference is made to them. Plutarch 187 elsewhere gives us further information about the Stepterion, though he does not describe it by that name. Apollo, he says, once fought with a snake for the possession of the Delphic oracle; and he proceeds to indicate various details in the ritual representation of the fight. " The hut (caXtad) which is erected here near the threshing-floor at intervals of eight years is not a cavernous serpent's hole, but an imitation of a royal or kingly dwelling." At this point Plutarch's text has suffered corruption; 188 but it is clear that certain persons, taking with them a boy whose parents were both alive, made a silent and stealthy attack upon the hut, and, having fired it with torches and upset the table-altar, fled through the doors of the precinct without looking behind them. In substantial agreement with this is the account of Ephorus,1s9 who stated that Apollo shot with his bow a fierce man named Python and surnamed Serpent, the Delphians burning his hut (clv'v1); in memory of which achievement the ritual was still kept up. Pausanias190 too records the statement that Python was not a mere snake, but " an over- bearing son of Crius, a chieftain of Eubcea, who rifled the 17 Plut. de def. orac., 15. 88" Conjectures are collected by A.

Plutarch 191 further speaks of " the wanderings and the service of the boy and the purifications that take place at Tempe," which in connection with his statement that the god fled to Tempe to obtain purifica- tion 192 makes it clear that the boy in the religious drama played the part of Apollo. The sequel is told by others. Aelian 193 in his description of Tempe says: "The sons of the Thessalians declare that here too the Pythian Apollo was purified at the bidding of Zeus, when he had shot the serpent Python that guarded Delphi while Ge still occupied the oracle. Apollo crowned himself with this laurel of Tempe, took a branch of it in his right hand, and came to Delphi, where he took over the oracle as the son of Zeus and Leto . . . . And down to the present day at intervals of eight years the Delphians send a procession of high-born youths, and one of themselves as leader (apXtLo'Wpo1). On their arrival they offer a magni- ficent sacrifice at Tempe and return again when they have wreathed crowns of the same laurel with which the god crowned himself in the past. They traverse the road that is called the Pythian way . . . . And the crowns that are given to the victors at the Pythian games are made of this laurel." So, then, the culminating act of the Stepterion was the wreathing or crowning with laurel of the youths who acted the part of the victorious god; and we are expressly told that victors in the Pythian games, which followed almost immediately,19' were crowned with the same laurel. Two inferences are obvious. On the one hand, Stepterion 19' Plut. de. def. orac., 15. 192 Supra, p. 402. I' Ael. var. hist. 3. I, cp. schol. Pind. Pyth., p. 298, B5ckh. 194 A.

Moreover, when we recollect the stealthy attack made by Apollo's repre- sentative upon the " royal or kingly dwelling " of the human Serpent, it becomes highly probable that the Pythian victor originally succeeded to the crown as being the champion Who had slain the previous king. These inferences are materially strengthened by the fact that the Pythian games were at first held, not every fourth year, but every eighth year:"196 they are indeed termed "an eight-year festival" (evveeTErpi)--the very word used by Plutarch of the Step- terion. Also it is known that the earliest form of the Pythian contest on record was "the singing of a hymn to the god";197 and that this hymn, the famous v1ttok IIvBOtcO, described the fight of Apollo with the Serpent.198 Now Pausanias,199 in his description of the temple at Delphi, says: " Not far from the hearth stands the throne of Pindar: it is of iron, and they say that whenever Pindar came to Delphi he used to sit on it and sing his songs to Apollo." From this it may be inferred that the Pythian victor was not only crowned king as personating the god, but actually sat on a throne beside the sacred hearth. 195 Cp.

Further confirmation of my conjecture, that a priestly king once reigned for eight years only at Delphi and that he was chosen as victor in the Pythian contest, is fortunately forthcoming. Aristotle200 states that the king who presided at the common hearth of the people was sometimes called their archon or " ruler." And an inscription201 found in 1892 at Magnesia on the Maeander mentions a certain Xenyllus, who lived about ogo90 B.C., as proarchon or " ruler of the eight-year festival at Delphi." It thus appears that, just as at Athens we saw first kings, then ten-year archons, and lastly annual archons, so at Delphi the annual archons were preceded by eight-year proarchons, and the eight-year proarchons by kings: also, that it was the express business of the eight-year proarchons to preside over the eight-year Pythian festival. With regard to the second part of this festival, the Herois, its name the " hero-feast" coupled with Plutarch's state- ment that its ritual resembled the evocation of the earth- goddess Semele suggests that it portrayed the resurrection of the Delphic heroes. But who were the heroes ? Possibly the whole line of Delphic kings and victors. "At Delphi," says the scholiast on Pindar,20? " an entertainment for heroes takes place, at which the god appears to invite the heroes to a banquet."

A fragment of his poetry preserved by Plato21' runs as follows: " For from whomsoever Persephone hath accepted the atonement of ancient woe, their souls she sendeth up once more notable coincidence he was himself slaughtered at Delphi beside the altar of Apollo. Hence to be treated as one has treated others is called the retribution of Neoptolemus."

From these grow up glorious kings and men of swift strength and men surpassing in poetic skill; and for all future time they are called holy heroes among men.' This resurrection of heroes after an interval of eight years can hardly be other than the resurrection represented at the eight-year Herois. On that showing, the heroes in question must have been kings and victors in gymnastic and musical contests-in short, the whole dynasty of priestly kings, who were apparently regarded as re-incar- nations of their predecessors.212 Lastly, as to the third and concluding portion of the festival, it is not difficult from our present point of view to see that Charila was a human scape-goat,183 to whom the guilt of the community in general, and of the king in particular, was transferred. This implies that at the end of every eight years the king was thought unfit to reign without a definite act of expiation: probably in the far past the king had himself been put to death as one who was no longer vigorous enough to produce satisfactory crops.214 At one time this eight-year festival seems to have been observed over a wider area. The Delians, for example, 212 This idea of reincarnation recurs in connection with the nine-year cycle of the Arcadians. Plin. nat. hist,, 8. 82, cites from Scopas Olympionicc the statement that Demaenetus the Parrhasian at the human sacrifice offered to Zeus Avicaioc by the Arcadians tasted the entrails of a boy-victim and was thereupon transformed into a wolf, but that nine years later he returned to human shape and won a victory in boxing at Olympia. In the same context (8. 81) Pliny quotes from Euanthes another Arcadian tale to the effect that the family of a certain Anthus cast lots, and that the man on whom the lot fell was taken to a lake and, after hanging his clothes on an oak-tree, swam across the lake to a desert place, where he was transformed into a wolf; that he associated with other such wolves for the space of nine years, and, if he had during that time abstained from attacking men, he was restored to his original shape, resumed his cast-off clothing, and had an additional nine years' lease of life granted him. 213 Cp. the examples given by Frazer, Golden Bough,2 iii., 124 if. 214 Supra, p. 392 f., cp. p. 383-</page><page sequence="41">The European Sky-god. 409 used in early days to send a sacred embassy to Delphi, a custom which having fallen in desuetude was revived in the second century B.C. and thenceforward maintained in accordance with the old eight-year cycle: an extant inscrip- tion 215 records a long list of Delian priests who together with certain Attic magistrates paid first-fruits to the god on that solemn occasion. Of more importance is the account given by Proclus 216 of the Boeotian Daphnephorza or "Laurel-bearing." This rite, which is best known nowadays through the noble painting of Sir Frederick Leighton, was enacted in the following fashion. " In Boeotia at intervals of eight years (V' dvveeTpp8o) the priests used to carry laurels to the precinct of Apollo, extolling him by means of a choir of maidens. The custom sprang from this cause. The Aeolians who dwelt in Arne and its neighbourhood migrated thence at the bidding of an oracle, and laying siege to Thebes, which had previously been occupied by Pelasgians, captured the town. When a festival of Apollo common to them both occurred, they made a truce and, having cut laurels, the one side from Helicon, the other from the river Melas, brought the same to the god. But Polematas the leader of the Boeotians dreamed that a young man gave him a complete set of armour and bade him offer prayers to Apollo along with a company of laurel-bearers once in every eight years. Two days later he attacked and van- quished the enemy. So he himself performed the rite of laurel-bearing, and the custom has been kept up ever since. In it they wreath a piece of olive-wood with laurels and various flowers. A bronze ball is attached to the top; and from it hang smaller balls. About the middle of the staff 215 Corp. inscrr. Attic.

The end of the staff they deck with a saffron-coloured stuff. They take the topmost ball to denote the sun, regarding Apollo himself as a sun-god; the ball beneath, to denote the moon, the small balls attached being the stars and planets, and the fillets, of which there are 365, being the year. A boy, whose parents are both living, is the ruler (ipXet) of the laurel-bearing. His nearest relative carries the wreathed staff, which they call kopo (rco rr) 217; but the laurel-bearer himself follows hold- ing the laurel. He has his hair long, and wears a golden crown. He is robed in a glittering costume reaching to his feet, which are shod with military shoes (ioIparT8a).'218 A choir of maidens follows after him, holding out branches while they chant hymns of supplication. The laurel- bearing procession used to go to the shrines of Ismenian219 and Chalazian220 Apollo." According to Proclus, then, the first laurel-bearer was a victorious Bceotian leader, whose successors at intervals of eight years were said to " rule " the laurel-bearing, and were dressed as kings (golden crown, &amp;c.). Moreover, they obviously represented the sky-god or sun-god-witness not only the long hair and glittering costume, but the staff tipped by a bronze sphere to denote the sun,221 with others to denote the moon and 217 The name Kw7rtw might denote " the thing held," cp.

At Thebes, as at Delphi, the tenure of this priestly king was reduced from eight years to one. Pausanias222 says: " The following custom is still to my knowledge observed in Thebes. A boy of good family, handsome and strong, is made priest of the Ismenian Apollo for a year. His title is laurel-bearer, for these boys wear crowns of laurel leaves." Dr. Frazer, in his commentary on this passage, suggests that the Theban laurel-bearing may have commemorated the slaying of the serpent by Cadmus, who was said to have served Ares eight years, as expiation for his offence.223 If this be so,224 the parallel between Theban and Delphic usage is complete; for Thebes, like Delphi, had a tradition that its monster was no mere animal, but a king called Serpent. Palakphatus225 declares: " The king of Thebes at that time was Serpent, the son of Ares, whom Cadmus slew, thereby obtaining the kingdom," and a frag- nient of Dercylus,226 the Argive historian, states "that Harmonia was the daughter of a Theban king named Serpent, and that Cadmus married her after slaying her father."

I would end by anticipating an objection, or rather two objections. If the victors of Delphi and Thebes were really regarded as temporary representatives of the sky-god, why do we hear of Apollo, not Zeus? And why were they crowned with laurel, not oak ? Apollo, it may be surmised, was but the solar form of the sky-god Zeus, a mere differentiation of that deity.228 As such he would dwell below the earth and thence send up his oracles to men.2"9 In short, Apollo was near akin to Hades, the earth-Zeus; and the fact that cults of Hades were so rare in Greece finds its explanation in the popu- larity of Apollo-worship. At Delphi, if Apollo occupies the foreground, Zeus can at least be recognised in the background. Within the great temple, side by side with the statue of Apollo Motpay~rr sl, stood the statue of Zeus MotparyeT1?.230 And the most cherished relics of the sacred precinct were connected with Zeus. Zeus had here erected the stone that Cronus had vomited forth 231 it was oiled daily and dressed in wool at every festival,232 being a veritable baetyl (,ai'rvXog) of Zeus.233 The eagles on the far-famed omphalos were those of Zeus.23- A vase at Vienna235 shows the omphalos flanked by Zeus and Apollo; while another at St. Petersburg 36 represents Themis (?) 228 Cp.

It was Zeus who had established Apollo as his inspired mouthpiece,237 and the Pythian priestess invoked Zeus immediately before taking her seat on the prophetic tripod.2"8 The promi- nence thus accorded to Zeus at Delphi is readily intel- ligible if Apollo himself was the solar (and therefore chthonian and mantic) form of the sky-god. But on this showing one would expect to find Apollo, like Zeus, connected with the oak, not with the laurel, at any rate in the remote past. And that is actually the case. The oldest of the Apolline myths is the story of the god's fight with Python at Delphi. Ovid,239 after telling it, adds that to keep in memory this signal victory the Pythian games were instituted, and that "whosoever had won with hand or feet or wheel received the honour of oaken foliage (aesculew . . . frondis): the laurel as yet was not, and Phoebus crowned his brows, fair with their flowing tresses, from the nearest tree." It appears, then, that the laurel had been preceded by the oak at Delphi. Now the earliest worshippers of the Delphic Apollo were "Cretans from Minoan Cnossus" ;240 and in Minoan Cnossus the oak was regarded as the tree of Zeus.241 I infer that the Delphic Apollo had inherited the oak of the Cretan242 Zeus. Agree- ably to this we read that, when the Cretans dedicated at Delphi an image of Apollo, it was simply a natural bough.243 7 Aesch. Eum., 17 ff. 2 lb., 28 f. m Ov. met., I. 445 ff- 240 Hymn. Hom.

In other words, at Delphi as elsewhere245 the sacred tree was represented by a column, a fact which throws fresh light on two at least of the problems connected with the Delphic cult. Zeus in the Libyan Oasis had an oracular oak, which in process of time withered away.246 Q. Curtius Rufus247 the historian, writing in the first century of our era, describes the cult-object in the Ammonium not as a sacred oak, nor even as a high pillar, but as "closely resembling an omphalos." I would suggest the same origin for the omphalos at Delphi, viz. : that it was the relic of a sacred stump or tree. This accords with the elongated shape that it has on certain vases."48 It also accounts for several other peculiarities of this much-debated object. The eagles of of oak "; but the analogy of the dry log (avov bXov) dedicated in the sanctuary of Apollo AictLoc at Sicyon (Paus., 2. 9. 7) renders it unnecessary to suppose that the bough was carved at all. 244 Clem. Al. strom., I. 164. The couplet cited by Clement hardly prove- his point: but he had access to the context, which we have not. Bi5tticher (Baumkultus, p. 227) accepts his statement on the ground that other representas tions of Apollo as a pillar are known (ib. fig. 53 c, d, e). Apollo at Amyclae "resembled a bronze pillar" (Paus., 3. 19. 2). 245 See e o. A. Evans, " Mycenoean Tree and Pillar Cult," inJourn. of Hell. Stud., xxi 9 ff.

This disposition of the birds recalls that of the doves at Dodona,2" 5where Zeus still had a living oak-tree, not a petrified stump. The omphalos was decked with prophylactic fillets ;255 and fillets dangle from the apex of Apollo-pillars on coins of Ambracia256 and Apollonia in Illyria.257 The agrenon or net-work of wool, in which the omphalos was dressed,258 was a mere mesh of fillets and is found in combination with them on the xoanon of Zeus at Mylasa. Lastly, the word omphalos (t00aX6) itself has been rightly connected with ompha (b6,d) the "oracular voice," 259 and again points to an oak like that of Dodona.260 I take it, then, that the common art-type of 249Journ. of Hell.

Apollo seated on his omphalos26' is comparable with that of Zeus FeXXavoq seated on his tree-trunk:262 indeed, a unique Cretan coin at Glasgow263 actually represents Apollo seated on a stump-a striking parallel to the Zeus of Phaestus. The brilliant discoveries of Mr. A. Evans at Cnossus have enabled us to trace the evolution of another Apolline symbol-the tripod. The Cretan Zeus, to whom Apollo approximated, had in Minoan times a group of three sacred trees, which were conventionalised into a triad of pillars.264 These pillars were connected by a top-piece, serving some- times as a libation-table,265 sometimes as a seat-like recep- tacle,266 sometimes as a bowl.267 Mr. Evans justly remarks 268 that this last variety supplied the prototype of such tripods as the Oxford specimen269 or that dedicated to Apollo at Delphi out of the spoils taken at Plataea,270 in which the divinity finds an anthropomorphic or zo6morphic expression. Plainly, therefore, the ordinary domestic tripod was a con- venient substitute for the baetylic triad, and this is its true significance in the Apolline cult.271 Apollo seated on his 261 E.g., Overbeck Kunstmyth.

The former arrangement is supported by the triad of baetylic pillars found at Cnossus, which were conjoined at the base (Class. Rev., xvii., 407 fig. 3). The latter has the analogy of the Apolline tripod in its favour. I incline to think that this view is decidedly more probable than the explanation which I put forward in Folk-Lore, xiv., 287 f.</page><page sequence="49">The European Sky-god. 417 tripod272 was tantamount to Apollo seated on his omphalos. Again, we have seen that the cult of the Pelasgian oak-Zeus gave rise to the names Triopas and Triops.273 It is, then, a fair conjecture that the Pythagoreans, who preserved so much Pelasgian lore, called the Delphic tripod triops274 because it was originally the symbol of the Pelasgian oak- god. Well might bronze tripods be given as prizes at the games of Apollo Tpt67rntoo,275 whose cult had been founded by the Thessalian Triopas.276 But Delphi was not the only place where Apollo was connected with the oak. A fine tetradrachm of Catana signed by the artist Chcerion, shows a full-faced head of Apollo crowned with oak-leaves and flanked by bow and lyre.277 Golden crowns of oak-leaves were dedicated in the temple of Apollo at Delos by Lysander and L. Cornelius Scipio.278 Beside Zeus 'Ao-icpatio, oak-god of Caria and Lydia,279 we find Apollo 'Aoicpato;, oak-god of Phrygia.2so Homer describes Apollo as leaning against an oak outside the walls of Troy281 or perching in the form of an eagle on the oak of his father Zeus.282 At Miletus too Apollo was called Apvinac or Apv~Paio, the god "of the oak-wood."283 To one interesting cult-title we can unfortunately assign no locality.

Again, the connection between Apollo and the oak comes out clearly in the myth of Dryope.284 Dryops, king of CEta, the son of Spercheiis and Polydora,28s5 had an only daughter Dryope, who tended her father's flocks. The Hamadryads loved her exceedingly and taught her how to hymn the gods and to dance. Apollo, who saw her dancing, was enamoured of her and, to attain his ends, became first a tortoise, which she fondled and put into her bosom, and then a snake. The second change scared away the nymphs, who left Dryope and her lover alone. Shortly afterwards Dryope was wedded to Andr3emon, son of Oxylus; but the result of her union with Apollo was the birth of Amphissus. He grew to man's estate, built the town of CEta, and established a temple of Apollo in Dryopis. When Dryope visited this temple, the Hamadryads carried her off and hid her in the forest. In her place they caused a poplar to spring from the ground and a fountain to gush forth beside it. Dryope now became a nymph. Amphissus founded a Nymphaeum in her honour and a contest in running, which is still kept up. From this contest women are excluded, the reason given being that, when Dryope was carried off by the nymphs, two maidens revealed the fact to the natives of the land and thus incurred the anger of the nymphs, who transformed them into fir-trees. In this myth Dryope, the "oak-maiden," is replaced by a poplar-a change that we have already met with in the 284 Ant. Lib., 32, from the 'E rEpotoUvEva of Nicander. 285 Another version made Dryops the son of Apollo and of Dia, a daughter of Lycaon (schol. Ap. Rhod., I. 1283, Etym. mag., 288, 34, Tzetz. ad Lyc. Alex., 480)</page><page sequence="51">The European Sky-god. 419 case of Zeus at Olympia, Lepreum, Sardes, and Cnossus.286 The same transition occurs in connection with Apollo him- self. We have seen him as an oak-god. It remains to see him as a poplar-god. A Roman coin of Alexandria Troas shows Apollo Lt6Evc standing before a poplar-tree with a tripod in front of him.287 Another coin of Apollonia in Illyria, struck by Caracalla, represents the statue of Apollo inside his temple, behind which appear the tops of three poplar-trees.288 The local cult was primitive in character; for autonomous coins of the town figure an aniconic Apollo- column crowned and filleted.289 I would suggest, therefore, that the three poplars visible on the coin of Caracalla are a triad of sacred trees, in which the deity was thought to reside.290 Apollo himself was probably represented by a priestly king with an annual tenure. For Herodotus 291 states that the cattle of the sun-god were kept there by the richest and noblest of the citizens, who mounted guard over them, each man for a year in turn. So sacrosanct was the man in charge that, when the citizens blinded one Evenius for neglect of his duties, their flocks and fields became barren, and oracles from Dodona and Delphi bade them make ample restitution to the injured man. This Evenius and his son Deiphonus had the gift of prophecy. The Apolloniates regarded Apollo as the founder of their town:292 when, therefore, Nero on coins of Apollonia describes him- 286 Folk-Lore, xv., 297 f. 2s7 Overbeck Kunstmyth.

Apollo, then, in several of his most primitive cults, was connected with the oak or poplar, the afyetpo(?-a word which meant "oak" before it meant "poplar." 294 In view of this fact I would venture to propound a fresh derivation of Apollo's name. The oldest form of the name seems to have been 'A7r'Xxov. Festus' 295 assertion that "the ancients used to say Apello for Apollo " is borne out not only by the occurrence of 'AfawXXcov in the inscriptions of Laconia, Megara, Corinth, Crete, Pamphylia, &amp;c., but also by the fact that there was a month called 'AercXXa~0o at Delphi, Heraclea, Tauromenium, Macedonia, Lamia, Panticapaeum, Phanagoria, Mylasa, Palmyra, Telanissus, &amp;c., while such names as 'AreXX'9, 'AWreXXaT~o, 'AWreXXiltov, were spread far and wide through the Greek world.296 Hence most recent investigators have started from 'A7reXXov as the " Grundform." 297 I would therefore derive 'A7rXXcov from the word adureXXOv, of which Hesychius says: da-reXXv a'tyetpog, o eo rte8o0S9 &amp;vSpov, i.e., " Apellon, a poplar, a kind of tree." An important inscription found at Delphi in 1895 records certain enactments of the Labyadae, an ancient Delphic phratry.298 It appears that a festival named 'Are'XXat was celebrated in the first Delphic month 'AreXXaFo9, which corresponded roughly with our July. The festival bore some resemblance to the Athenian Apaturia. Victims called a7TeXata and loaves called 8apdTra were then brought, the 293 Head, Hist. num., p. 266. 294 Folk-Lore, xv., 297.

The inscription gives us more than one formula of swearing used by the Labyadae, whose oaths prove that they recognised a triad of gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo. We have met with the same triad before 299 as a variation on the original Zeus-triad, viz. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. I am thus strengthened in my belief that Apollo at Delphi was the chthonian 300 form of the sky-god, in a word the local Hades. But this in turn supports my contention that he was a poplar-god. For the poplar, as Batticher301 has shown, was the tree sacred to Hades. Suidas302 states that it was "a chthonian tree," adding that it was said to grow on the banks of the Acheron and hence was called 'AXepco' in Homer.303 Some held that the AXepot' was a kind of oak304; but it was commonly identified with the white poplar or XeicKq. Its legend is told by Servius.305 Leuce, daughter of Oceanus, the fairest of all nymphs, was loved by Pluto, who carried her off to the world below. With him she spent her life; and, when in due time she died, he solaced his love by causing the tree XeVK?7 to grow in the Elysian fields. If my speculations are in the main correct, Hades the lover of Ae'icvt is to be identified, not only with Zeus AcvKcaito, but also with Apollo the god of the poplar (a~rre~XXv). The foregoing argument is strengthened by the fact that the same alternatives, oak and poplar, occur in the case of other solar personages. The Heliades, daughters of the 299 Folk-Lore, xv., 279. 00 Porphyrius ap. Serv. in.

On the one hand, he planted two oaks beside the altars of Zeus $7p&amp;'~o' in Pontus,309 and founded a cult of Aphrodite Iaoat4eco-aa in Thessaly beneath an evergreen oak.310 His toils and troubles were foretold to him by his father's oak at Dodona.311 He was, according to Callimachus,312 apotheo- sised in Phrygia beneath an oak-tree. His pyre on Mount (Eta was built of oak and wild-olive.313 A branch of oak was an acceptable gift to him;314 and his club is surrounded on coins by a wreath of oak-leaves.315 On the other hand, Heracles was said to have brought the white poplar from the banks of the Acheron in Thesprotis ;316 and the white poplar was his favourite wreath.317 A bronze statuette of Heracles, 06 Roscher Lex., ii., 2588. 307 Ib., i., 1983. 30" Heracles forced Helios to lend him the golden cup in which he used to cross the ocean (Pherecydes ap.

Hence in the Rhodian Tlepolemea-games held in memory of Tlepolemus son of Heracles-the victor's wreath was of white poplar.321 Another surrogate of the oak was the laurel, or, to speak more accurately, the bay. Professor J. R. Green informs me that the species of oak most likely to flourish in northern Greece, the quercus dlex or holm-oak, bears a decided resemblance to the bay. He has kindly furnished me with specimen leaves of the two trees, and points out that they approximate to each other alike in shape and in colour. The bay-leaf, like the ilex-leaf, is ovate-lanceolate, the former being minutely dentated, the latter minutely serrated. Both have a glossy dark-green upper-surface and a lighter under-surface. In fact, the untrained observer might readily confuse the two. It should also be noted that the Delphic bay came from Tempe,322 where it was called 8vapeia,323 a name perhaps comparable32" with 8"pvXXog, the Macedonian word for " oak."325 Indeed, various philo- logists have held that names of the laurel or bay are related to names of the oak.326 If that be so, we have found an 3si Brit.

We reply with some confidence that the laurel or bay was a recognised substitute for the oak. One more botanical point, and I have done. In Greece special importance was attached to mistletoe (i16() grow- ing on the oak. Ion327 the tragedian in his Phenix or Cweneus called mistletoe, "the sweat of the oak," just as Antiphanes328 the comedian in his Aphrodisius called wine " the sweat of the Bromian spring," i.e. of the vine. The implication is perhaps that the mistletoe was the concentrated essence, or life-blood of the oak. This assumption at least enables us to understand the part played by mistletoe in myth and cult. The good ship Argo was not only fitted with a fragment of Dodonaean oak,"32 but also, according to Alexander Polyhistor,330 constructed of wood from the "lion "-tree, which he described as a tree like the mistletoe-bearing oak: it could not, he said, be destroyed by water or by fire331 any more than the mistletoe can. If, as I have already supposed,332 the Argo or Zeus-ship was a mythical expression for the sun, it may be that the mistletoe was credited with special E aibrb cal AylXia.

The name "lion "-tree points in the same direction, for the lion was a common symbol of the sun.333 Again, Ptolem?eus,334 who records the Rhodian version of the myth of Helen, viz., that she was the daughter of the sun and hanged herself on an oak, mentions in the same context that she went by the name of AeovT?r, "Lioness." One of her suitors was called AeovTres, " Lion," 335 so that once more we find the sun connected with the lion, and both of them with the oak. Further, there is reason to believe that in Rhodes the mistletoe stood in close relation to the sun. For, not only was there a cult of Mistletoe Apollo ("Iftoo 'AwrbXXwv) at Ixiai, a Rhodian town named after the mistletoe ;336 but Leonteus, the suitor of Helen was by some337 regarded as the father of Ixion, whose "" See Preller-Robert, p. 455, Gruppe, p. 798 f.
