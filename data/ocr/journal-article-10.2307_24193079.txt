Motzkin MAIMONIDES AND SPINOZA1 ON GOOD AND EVIL2 "The Good" is a central concept of Plato's and Aristotle's Metaphysics.3 It is sometimes discussed as a synonym of "the end."4 (and so as a synonym for "that which is most due"), whereas at other times it is another way of saying "that which is beautiful," i.e., that which corresponds to the paradigm of shape, or of arrangement, or of intended product, or of "that which truly is."5 I The locus classicus of Maimonides' position on Good (and Evil) is found in chapter two of the first part of The Guide of the Perplexed.6 Maimonides had Earlier versions of this paper were read at Boston University, Brandeis University, the University of Illinois (Urbana), McGill University, The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), The Pennsylvania State University, Trinity College, and Washington University at St. Louis.

It is an appropriate beginning, for Maimonides's explicit intention in part one of The Guide is to discuss all the anthropomorphic or otherwise inappropriate terms in the Hebrew Scriptures, in order to explain them away, thus establishing securely the existence of a realm of separate intellects, hierarchically ordered.7 The very first instance of a Biblical verse which can be anthropomorphically interpreted occurs in the first chapter of Genesis. It reads as follows: "And God said, let us make man in our image, after our own likeness."* This phrase, "in the image,'בצלם) י) is apparently considered so significant by the author of Genesis that it is repeated thrice, twice in the next verse: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him." Now the original sense of the verse is probably explained straightaway, in light of verse 26 itself: "And let them/' one would assume both the male and the female who are mentioned in the next verse, "have dominion over... all the earth." In other words, man is God's viceroy on earth, and he is in the image of God, he imitates God, in the sense of ruling. God is the ruler of the universe (which includes light, day and night, the heavens and the water above them, the sun, the moon and the stars), and man is the ruler of the earth, and specifically of all that the earth and the sea bring forth, all that grows and all that is alive. That seems to be the intention of the Biblical author.9 But that is not what Maimonides makes of it. Maimonides wants to establish, as we noted, a realm transcending the observable phenomena, a realm beyond the sensible universe.10 He insists on the existence of metaphysics because he wishes to demonstrate the potentially divine nature of man, which he understands to be the noetic nature of man. In other words, man is created in the image of God, because God is a pure intellect, and man shares in that intellect. Man is the only observable existing being that bridges the realm of matter and the realm of mind, and thus partakes in the divine. It is in this sense that we may say that man is in the image of God and after his own likeness." The Guide, II, 4. Genesis 1:26. Cf. Psalm 115:16 (The heavens are the heavens of God, and the earth he has given to human beings). See Gerhard von Rad, Genesis (trans, by John Marks; 3rd ed.; Old Testament Library; London: SCM, 1972), 57-60. This particular problem was first addressed by Philo in De opificio mundi, in which he asserts that the two creation stories in Genesis relate the story of the creation of the ideal world of forms first and then the physical world of the senses. "Now man possesses as his proprium something in him that is very strange as it is not found in anything else that exists under the sphere of the moon, namely, intellectual apprehension. In the exercise of this, no sense, no part of the body, none of the extremities are used; and therefore this apprehension was likened unto the apprehension of the deity, which does not require an instrument, although in reality it is not like the latter apprehension, but only appears</page><page sequence="3">Maimonides and Spinoza VII This interpretation by Maimonides serves two complementary purposes: it establishes the exclusively intellectual character of God and it establishes the essentially intellectual character of man. In this way Maimonides makes metaphysics, or the science of the separate intellects, possible, and he makes the central issue of metaphysics (i.e., of natural theology or the science of being),12 the knowability of God, or of the ground of being a legitimate area of inquiry. This means that man can, in the final analysis, know God through introspection. If God and man share essentially an identical nature, then the Delphic oracle could have intended by his maxim not only to lead to human awareness, but also to the awareness of God by way of what both Aristotle13 and Ibn Kaspi14 (to name only two) called "the God within us."15 That this central Maimonidean enterprise runs counter to his explicit negative theology is, of course, obvious.16 This issue, however, must be left for discussion so to the first stirrings of opinion. It was because of this something, I mean because of the divine intellect conjoined with man, that it is said of the latter that he is in the image of God and in His likeness, not that God, may he be exalted, is a body and possesses a shape."

This interpretation of the Delphic oracle begins with Plato's Socrates himself, who reasons in Alcibiades I that knowledge of oneself resides in the soul: "The soul must look at itself, that means at the virtue of the soul which is wisdom. This part of the soul is like the divine, so that anyone who looks at it knows all that is divine, God and thinking, so also in the highest sense he knows himself."

Just the same, we could not speak of chapter two of The Guide without having reference to chapter one, as brief as this reference had to be. To Maimonides as well as to Plato,17 Aristotle,18 Spinoza19 and Kant (to name only a few), morality has a metaphysical underpinning, and before speaking of the central issue of morality, one must first speak of the foundations of the metaphysics of morals. Chapter One of The Guide is indeed the introduction to the whole book (not counting the methodological introductions which precede it) and it leads immediately to an examination of what is to Maimonides one of the central issues, if not the central issue of philosophy, namely, the relationship of philosophy and the Law, or of philosophy and religion, or of metaphysics and ethics. All of these pairs of terms are to Maimonides more or less synonymous. He goes about it in the following way: It appears there is a contradiction between chapters one and two of Genesis. We have just learned that man was created in the image of God. We have interpreted this to mean that man's essential characteristic is his noetic character. God is the universal nous, man the sub lunar nous, or, at the very least, man may unite with the sub-lunar nous, the working mind, the nous poietikos.20 What this means is that man is homo sapiens, man the wise, or man the knower, the knower even of universal truths, let alone of the things around him, of the things that move, of the things which are active, of motion and of action. He knows about action, about how things act, and of course about how he acts and should act. But what does chapter two of Genesis tell us? It tells us that man was placed in the Garden of Eden, that he was permitted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the Garden, including the Tree of Life. "But the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil thou shalt not eat thereof, for in the day that thou eatest of it, thou shalt surely die." So Genesis 2:17. Man is explicitly forbidden to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Man is forbidden to know.11 He may eat of all other trees, including the Tree of Life, and may thus partake of eternal life. But he may not know. Passim, and cf. Republic 386c-394b. Cf. Nicomachean Ethics VI. Spinoza's Ethics begins with a discussion of God, then of ideas and the intellect. Ethical principles are then derived from the metaphysical formulations. Cf. The Guide, III, 52. "It is manifest from the clear sense of the biblical text that the primary purpose with regard to man was that he should be, as the other animals are, devoid of intellect, of thought, and of the capacity to distinguish between Good and Evil. However, when he disobeyed, his disobedience procured him as its necessary consequence the great perfection peculiar to man, namely, his being endowed with the capacity that exists in us to make this distinction." The Guide, 1, 2 (Pines p. 23-4).</page><page sequence="5">Maimonides and Spinoza IX If we interpret literally, in acordance with my suggested interpretation, namely, that the Scriptures make explicit the divine character of man as viceroy or guardian of the earth, there is no difficulty. Rulers need not be omniscient. If God is everlasting and rules eternally over the whole universe, so man must be everlasting and rule eternally over the earth. He may therefore eat of the Tree of Life.22 But a master gardener need not know everything there is to know. If knowledge is power, then omniscience entails omnipotence. A supremely powerful man might rebel against the owner, the original planter of the garden and may try to overthrow him. He may, for instance, build a tower and try to reach the heavens for that very purpose. And so one must take measures to make this impossible: Thus, "thou shalt not eat...23 Yet one can immediately see that Maimonides is confronted here with a difficult problem, which seems to fly in the face of his, if you will, intellectual interpretation of image, and of the relationship of God and man. If man imitates God by "intellecting," how can he be prevented from knowing? Maimonides solves this contradiction in an ingenious way. It is made clear in The Guide24 that man does imitate God in God,s exclusive and essential activity. God is pure intellect, and the activity of pure intellect is, for want of a better word, intellecting.25 To "intellect" means to grasp the intelligibles, the objects of the intellect. These objects are the eternal verities. They are changeless. Since, as Maimonides makes clear in chapter 68 of Part One, the intellect, the act of intellecting, and the intelligibles {nous, noein and noeta) are identical, God intellects, by definition if you like, only changeless, eternal things.26 To assert otherwise would be to attribute change to God. But that is impossible, for change is an attribute of bodies: change and motion are identical. Motion of whatever variety — e.g., locomotion, generation and corruption, growth-is impossible for God. God does not move. He is not born, he does not die. There is no amelioration in God, and there is no deterioration, either. If God's knowledge increases, this means that at one point it was not complete, not It might be useful to reflect on how Maimonides understood "Tree of Life." Cf. The Guide I, 42, esp. his citation of B.T., Berakhoth, 18a-b. Indeed, a central concern of primeval human history in Genesis is in fact usurpation of God's prerogatives. Eve usurps the right to create life, producing "a man" (4:1), Cain then usurps the right to take life (4:8), men then attempt intercourse with the divine (6:2-3) and even after the flood they attempt to build a tower and pathway to heaven, the private sphere of God (11:4).

In short, God has no history, and he is outside history.27 To return to the problem: to the extent that man may imitate God, he imitates him by being open to the knowledge of these eternal verities, by being open to the whole. Man may, so to speak,plug into God. It is at that instant, and as long as man remains plugged in through this intellectualizing activity, that we may say of man that he shares in the divine, that he is a divine being. Generally speaking, says Maimonides, man is potentially divine. When his intellect is in actu, he is in fact, actually divine.28 Now, what about the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Good (and evil), says Maimonides, are not objects of pure knowledge.29 They are not identical with true or false, which are the proper attributes of pure knowledge. Good (and evil) refer to a radically different domain. They refer to the domain of practical philosophy, or morality.30 Now what is morality and why and for whom is it necessary? It is clearly not meant for beasts. You don't say about a cat or about a horse that it has committed a shameful act, nor do you say about a parrot or about an elephant that it has acted in a noble way. For that matter, says Maimonides,31 you do not attribute shame or nobility to an idea or to an intellect. Three plus four equals seven, always. That is eternally true. It is neither noble nor good. To say that three plus four equals eight is false, always, forever. It is not base to say it. It is not evil. Thus one may not attribute nobility or shame to the separate intellects, to God or to the secondary causes. Morality is the peculiar domain of that ambiguous creature, that unique ambiguous creature, man. It is a corollary of his peculiar semi-divine, semi-brutish nature, or perhaps one should say of his peculiar status, which may gravitate upward toward the divine or downward, toward the brutish. Morality, or Ethics, is the science of the proper control of man's brutish passions in order to make possible his dedication, or his The Guide, I, 55. The Guide, I, 68. "Fine and bad (the Arabic uses two cognates of the words "good and evil")... belong to the things generally accepted as known, not to those cognized by the intellect." The Guide, I, 2 (Pines, p. 24). Cf. Shlomo Pines, "On Spinoza's Concept of Human Freedom and of Good and Evil," in N. Rotenstreich Sl N. Schneider, Spinoza, His Thought and Work (Jerusalem: The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1983) p. 149f. Pines traces this idea back to the distinction in Aristotle between the theoretical and practical soul (On the Soul 433a 13ff, Ethics 114 la, 23). Of the commentators on Aristotle known to Maimonides, John Philoponus in particular holds that "the Good" is the goal of the practical soul, while the theoretical soul, which is superior to the practical soul, has "truth" as its end. "For one does not say: it is fine that heaven is spherical, and it is bad that the earth is flat; rather one says true and false with regard to these assertions." — The Guide, I, 2 (Pines, p. 24-5).</page><page sequence="7">Maimonides and Spinoza XI absorption, perhaps his obsession with his superior or potentially divine nature. Morality is thus a consequence of man's fall and of his infra-divine status. It is unnecessary as long as man inhabits God's own orchard and abstracts from his body. As long as man is not aware of his body, of his animal nature, it is of no consequence. Only what man thinks about, only what man knows, is significant, in other words, truly is. To paraphrase Descartes, "sola sunt ea quia cogitat homo. (Only those things are which man thinks about)." The moment man becomes aware of his body, or, as the Bible says, "of his nakedness,"32 that means, of course, of his reproductive, sexual, animal nature, does he coevally discover shame.33 That is what shame means to the author of the Biblical narrative as well as to Maimonides: the realization of man's poor estate, of his infra-divine nature, of his limitations, of his physical nature. The realization of his physical and animal nature leads, or should lead (the fact-value distinction never occurred to Maimonides or his predecessors), to the institution of morality, i.e., to the institution of general guidelines to the solution of the problem of man's ambiguous nature. That shame is most intimately connected with the animal-nature of human beings, with human sexuality, can be learned from Maimonides' repetition of the phrase, "The sense of touch is a shame to us."34 He attributes this notion to Aristotle.35 I need not elaborate on the connection between sexuality and the sense of touch. It is only necessary to remember that every other one of the senses has an organ associated with it: for sight, the eyes; for hearing, the ears; for smell, nose; and so on down the line. Whatever Aristotle may have thought of it,36 it is clear that Maimonides was quite annoyed by the fact that human beings have five, rather than four senses, thus bringing them down from time to time to the level of the irrational beast. Genesis 3:7. Genesis 3:10: "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." The Guide, dll, 36, 40; III, 8, 49. The passage in the Nicomachean Ethics (III, χ, 11) reads: "Hence, the sense to which Profligacy is related is the most universal of the senses; and there appears to be good ground for the disrepute in which it is held (δικαίως έπονείδιστος είναι) because it belongs to us not as human beings, but as animals.'י (ότι ουκ η άνθρωποι έσμεν υπάρχει, άλλ' η ζώα) Cf. The Guide I, Chapters 43, 28, 49, II, Chapters 2, 6, and in general chapters 3-12, where Maimonides discusses the spheres (and their souls and intellects), i.e., the angels. Cf. also Porphyry, The Life of Plotinus, I, 1, where Porphyry quotes Plotinus as having said that he was ashamed to be found in a body, (φιλόσοφος έφκει μεν αίσχυνομένψ ότι έν σώματι είη). Aristotle mentions τίνα μέρη, which Maimonides takes to include the mouth: III, 8 reads: "they take as their end the sense that is our greatest shame, I mean the sense of touch. Accordingly they have no thought and no perception except only in relation to eating and copulation, as has been clearly stated with regard to these wretched people wholly given over to eating, drinking and copulating." (Pines, p. 433).</page><page sequence="8">XII Aryeh L. Motzkin Maimonides's discussion of shame reminds us of the one prerequisite Socrates demanded of his interlocutors: the possession of a sense of shame. Those who did not possess shame, say Thrasymachus in the Republic? or Callicles in the Gorgias? did not, indeed, could not communicate with Socrates. They disappear from the dialogues in which they appear soon after registering their total disgust with the proceedings, usually by means of an emotional outburst.39 Why does Socrates insist that he speak only with those who know shame?40 Because shame implies at least a rudimentary notion of the existence of Good (and evil), that is, of the existence of morality, if of conventional morality. Socrates, that is to say, the philosopher, searches to be sure for a natural morality, a morality based on reason, a morality which is non-conventional, or trans-conventional. But the nature of the search is such that unless the searcher knows in his bones, so to speak, that morality as such is absolutely (that is, relative to the human condition) necessary, there is always the danger that he would misinterpret the search for a universal morality at mid-inquiry. He would then be left in limbo, having abandoned conventional morality, not having as yet established a natural morality. This would lead to moral anarchy and the disintegration of civil society. Thus the insistence on a well-developed sense of shame. This prerequisite that the participant in Plato's dramas possess a distinct moral profile is precisely the prerequisite that Maimonides demands of the participant, in this case the reader of his Guide. He paints an exact picture of him Republic 336b-354c. Gorgias 481b-527e. Callicles does reappear toward the end of the Gorgias. However, in 482c,ff he reveals his true colors, and makes a long speech in which he claims that philosophy is only useful as an embellishment. In the Symposium Plato's Socrates speaks of the necessity of a sense of shame as part of eros: "For the guiding principle we should choose for all our days, if we are minded to live a comely life, cannot be acquired by kinship or office or wealth or anything so well as by Love. What shall I call this power? The shame that we feel for shameful things (την επί μέν τοις αίσχροΐς αίσχύνην) and ambition for what is noble; without which it is impossible for city or person to perform any high or noble deeds." (178c) In the Gorgias, however, he speaks of shame in his interlocutors as disqualifying them from participation becuase it prevents them from being truthful; "I meet with many people who are unable to test me, because they are not wise as you are; while others, though wise, are unwilling to tell me the truth, because they do not care for me as you do; and our two visitors here, Gorgias and Polus, though wise and friendly, are more lacking in frankness and inclined to shame (αίσχυντηροτέρω) than they should be: nay, it must be so, when they have carried shame (αισχύνη) to such a point that each of them can bring himself, out of sheer shame (δια τό αΐσχύνεσθαι), to contradict himself in face of a large company, and that on questions of the greatest importance." (487B) And later, "Callicles, that is how I upset Polus and Gorgias, and struck them with shame (αίσχύνεσβαι έποίησα); but you, I know, will never be upset or ashamed (αίσχυνθής); you are such a manly fellow." (494D) There is of course irony here, but his intention is also reminiscent of the dictum of the sages: לא הבישן למד"," he who is struck with shame cannot learn.</page><page sequence="9">Maimonides and Spinoza ΧΠΙ in the The Guide.*1 The moral habit is a necessary, though not a sufficient condition for gaining entrance to the orchard of Maimonides. Now it might appear that it is in the moral sphere rather than in the contemplative sphere that man's perfection lies. Is it not true that it is morality which is specific to humanity, which is, if you will, the specific differentia of mankind? Morality is neither animal nor divine, but the vita contemplativa is divine as well as human. After all, the contemplative life, the life of the intellect, is not the exclusive domain of man. It is also the domain of God and the angels.42 One could therefore reasonably argue that the vocation of man lies in the sphere of morality, that it is incumbent upon man, if he wishes to attain his ultimate felicity, to ceaselessly devote himself to the nurturing and refinement of the moral virtues, of the moral life.43 But that is not the position of Maimonides. He makes quite clear, in chapter two, throughout The Guide, and everywhere else in his voluminous corpus of writings, that the moral virtues are a poor second to the intellectual virtues, that the moral man stands on a lower rung on the ladder to perfection than the contemplative man.44 How would Maimonides defend this position, Compare Maimonides' description of Joseph as one "worthy to have the secrets of the prophetic books revealed to" him (Introduction), with what he says in I, 34 about those to whom the Account of the Chariot may be revealed. Cf. especially the end of the chapter where Maimonides continues: "Rabbi Yohanan said to Rabbi Elazar: Come, so that I should teach you the Account of the Chariot! Whereupon Rabbi Elazar said to him: I am not yet old; he means: I am not yet aged and up to now find in myself the effervescence of nature and the recklessness of adolescence." (Pines, p. 78-9) Recklessness is akin to shamelessness, each is present in the imprudent and the intemperate. (Cf. n. 39 above.) The reckless and intemperate Alcibiades, once no longer in Socrates' company, lets his tyrannical nature rise to the surface. Compare MacDuff to Malcolm (Macbeth IV, iii, 66-67): Boundless intemperance in nature [i.e., in man's nature] is a tyranny. What is then the relationship between the search for wisdom (where, as Socrates points out, shamelessness and recklessness are desirable) and tyranny? Cf. A. Kojeve, Tyrannie etsagesse, in L. Strauss, De la tyrannie (Paris: Gallimard, 1954). Compare The Tempest and Sonnet 94. On the angels, cf. Clement of Alexandria, Prophetic Eclogue, 56, Origen, On Prayer 27.10 and Evagrius Ponticus, Gnostic Chapters 3.4. On God, cf. Origen, Commentary on John 32.28 and Gregory of Nazianzus, Orations 38.9; cf. The Guide, I, Chapters 43, 28, 49, II, Chapters 2,6, and in general chapters 3-12, where Maimonides discusses the spheres (and their souls and intellects), i.e., the angels. This is the position of Kant, who believed, further, that the moral life had no purpose beyond itself. It is not only divorced from contemplative experience, it supplants contemplative experience. Maimonides' position conforms as well with the Platonist tradition. On the moral stage preceeding the higher stage of contemplation, Origen and Evagrius Ponticus were particularly important. See J. LeMattre, R. Roques St M. Viller, "Contemplation chez les grecs," Section B. Origene, 1. La division de la vie spirituelle, in Dictionnaire de Spiritualite (M. Viller, ed.; Paris: 1937ff) 2.1769. These two stages were often called "φυσική" and "θεωρία."</page><page sequence="10">XIV Aryeh L. Motzkin notwithstanding his acceptance of the classical position that, since the essence is the definition, and the definition consists of the genus plus the specific differentia,45 the perfection of any being consists in exclusive dedication to the refinement of those differentia? Although Maimonides never speaks of this directly, but rather assumes that the solution to this problem is self-evident, I believe it is necessary at this time to state certain things explicitly which were viewed by Maimonides, his predecessors and his contemporaries as obvious. To repeat, morality is an unfortunate if ineluctable consequence of man's fall, of man's ambiguous nature. It is required in the same way that in order to ride a race horse one requires reins, blinders and spurs. But the superior or perfect race horse is not the horse that has superior reins, blinders and spurs. All of these may be paraphernalia for a distinctly inferior horse. The superior or perfect race horse is the one that runs fastest, the horse that develops to the utmost that within him which is his superior part. And so with man. Morality is but reins, blinders and spurs. It is an exigent, but clearly an inferior human sphere, needful by man in order to attain his superior nature.46 What I have outlined here is a world-view based on certain assumptions which were shared by almost all classical and medieval philosophers. These assumptions are that truth is superior to falseness, that cosmos or order is superior to anarchy, in short, that being is superior to non-being. These are assumptions no longer viewed as self-evident. And one of the first to call them into question was, of course, Benedict de Spinoza. II When I say that the seeds of both modern (as distinct from classical or medieval) ethics as well as metaphysics are all found in Spinoza, I am not unmindful of the fact that Spinoza is in many ways beholden to his predecessors, not the least of whom to Maimonides.47 But Spinoza most explicitly called for a break with the Aristotle Posterior Analytics 96b 15-97b 34; Topics 101b 16-19, and esp. 103b 15. Cf. Plato Timaeus 30b; Laws 961d-e, Phaedrus 247c and ff. S. Pines, "On Spinoza's Conception," p. 151 ff. Pines asserts that Maimonides prefigures Spinoza in making knowledge of good and evil a decline from man's perfect state, and implies that this Maimonidean as well as Spinozistic position points to Spinoza's making freedom from the notion of good and evil a philosophical imperative (Ethica IV, LXIV and Scholium to LXVIII.) Pines further claims (p. 150, n. 9) that according to "both philosophers... knowledge of good and evil is in itself a defect." I cannot agree with Pines that Maimonides' and Spinoza's positions are in any way identical. As is his wont, Maimonides simply uses the Biblical account to assert the superiority of theoretical to practical wisdom, a perfectly acceptable Aristotelian thesis. Further on (p. 153) Pines notes that Spinoza's position is different from Maimonides' on several points, among which is that, according to Maimonides at least, recourse to judgments</page><page sequence="11">Maimonides and Spinoza XV whole tradition of Philosophy. "Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, they do not carry much weight with me."48 The only one he exempts from criticism is Democritus. The only philosopher whom Spinoza actually eulogizes is Machiavelli.49 And he very often singles out Maimonides for specific, even scathing criticism.50 What of good and evil are, "given the human condition,... unavoidable." Pines does call to our attention the remarkable similarity between Nietzsche and Spinoza, and quotes from Nietzsche's letter to Franz Overbeck (30 July 1881): "I am astonished and charmed! I have a forerunner. I hardly knew Spinoza.... I recognize myself in five main points of his doctrine.... he denies freedom of will; final ends; the moral order of the world; that which is the unegoistic; evil." Nietzsche's ideas of morality are the ruling notions of morality of the twentieth century, and one of the main points of this article is that Spinoza's morality is indeed the fountain of contemporary ethics or morality. Maimonides is emphatically not the "father of Spinoza's logos," but Spinoza is, indirectly, the father of Nietzsche's. Spinoza, Letter 50 to Hugo Boksel, sometimes numbered 56): "nonmultumapudme Authoritas Platonis, Aristotelis, ac Socratis valet." Spinoza, Tractatus Politicus, ch. V. See Letter 43 (to Jacob Ostens, and sometimes 49) see C.H. Bruder's edition in Benedicti de Spinoza Opera (Leipzig: B. Tauchnitz, 1846), Vol. II, p. 297, and especially Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Chap. VIII, e.g. "we dismiss Maimonides' theory as harmful, useless and absurd." (Quapropter hanc Maimonidae sententiam ut noxiam, inutilem et absurdum explodimus.) One of the more serious contemporary Maimonidean scholars, Warren Z. Harvey, wrote an article on the same topic as this one, הרמבם ושפינוזה על ידיעת טוב ורע" — Maimonides and Spinoza on the Knowledge of Good and Evil," Iyyun 28, 2-3(1978), 167-85. As usual, Professor Harvey's article contains many illuminating points. The thrust of Harvey's article is that Maimonidean ethics is, mutatis mutandis, Spinozean ethics, and is based on the same understanding of "good. "He adduces several texts to buttress his argument. I fear, however, that I must disagree with Harvey's interpretation of some of these texts. It is no doubt true, as he points out, that Spinoza's ethics is primarily utilitarian. He quotes Spinoza: "the good is what is useful to us." (Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus 4; Ethics 1.2; Harvey, op. cit., p. 167). It seems to me, however, that here (as elsewhere) Spinoza makes a radical break with the understanding of "good" which preceded the advent of modernity. A consideration of the amphibolousness of "good" cannot of course be avoided. On the one hand, the term "good is understood as a synonym of "the best," or "the ideal," or "the good in theory," as for example in Plato, but this understanding of good crops up in all of philosophical literature, and I believe that there is hardly a philosophical author that does not use good in an amphibolous sense. (Cf. e.g. Nicomachean Ethics I, vi, esp. 1096a 7-26.) Now to The Guide, III, 13. Here Maimonides asserts that good is "that which is in conformity with our purpose." What he means by this phrase is "that which is in conformity with the final cause," i.e., that which is in harmony with the intention or purpose of man. The "useful" in classical ethics, which Maimonides represents, is understood in contradistinction to the "noble" or "beautiful." The purpose of man, "our purpose," corresponds more to these supererogatory notions than to the "useful." This tension does not exist in Spinoza's ethics, in fact, that is its most telling characteristic. I think that the basic point to keep in mind at all times when we read Maimonides and Spinoza is that in Maimonides there is a cleavage between the dual nature of the whole which is not present in Spinoza. One can speak of course of a certain</page><page sequence="12">XVI Aryeh L. Motzkin dual aspect of the whole, that is to say, one can point to Spinoza's speaking about the only two known attributes of God's nature, thought and extension. But for Spinoza these are but two aspects of one nature. Spinoza's understanding of God or Nature is completely antithetical to Maimonides' teaching. It is true that Maimonides speaks of the divine actions as natural actions in The Guide III, 32. But nowhere does Maimonides identify God with the whole of Nature. To say, as Harvey points out, that in Maimonides the laws of physics correspond with the divine (Harvey, op. cit., p. 169, fn. 21 )is not tantamount to saying that Nature and God are one as such. In fact, the whole enterprise of The Guide of the Perplexed is precisely to counter that approach, in other words, to show that God is not extensive, not corporeal, and therefore to make the identification of God with Nature as such an impossibility. For Spinoza, God (the only meaningful God) can be known, because Nature can be known, because the Book of Nature, as was pointed out by Spinoza's predecessor, Francis Bacon, is a book that can be read (See the beginning of The Advancement of Learning) whereas for Maimonides-as has been pointed out by Professor Pines, although I take issue with Pines' radical formulation — God is hidden ("The Limitations of Human Knowledge According to Al-Farabi, ibn Bajja and Maimonides," in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, edited by Isadore Twersky, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979, p. 98). That does not mean that we can say absolutely nothing about God, it does not mean that metaphysics is ipso facto impossible; it does mean that we cannot assert simply that God is knowable. Between these two extreme formulations — that nothing can be said about God, which is the way we understand what Maimonides says explicitly, and between saying, as Professor Harvey seems to say here, that God can be known — there is, I believe, another way in which Maimonides can be understood, and that is that discourse about God is possible in the classical philosophical sense. Ultimate knowledge is not simply (i.e., absolutely) available, yet this is not sufficient ground to state with finality that we can say nothing worthwhile about its themes. This is the classical understanding of the core of the philosophic enterprise. In this connection it is crucial to note that for Maimonides the notion of final cause is absolutely fundamental, whereas for Spinoza final causes are human fictions. That notion in itself determines the whole discussion of good (and evil) as well. This is not to deny that there are some areas of agreement between Spinoza and Maimonides, nor would I deny that Maimonides' true teaching is far more complex than his explicit teaching on this subject. This was well known to almost all of Maimonides' early commentators, the most useful (in both the Maimonidean and the Spinozean sense) of them being Narbonni and Ibn Kaspi. To repeat, I believe that Harvey is correct in calling attention to The Guide I, 68, in which Maimonides identifies God with "the scientific system of the universe," and it is true, as Professor Pines points out (Translator's Introduction, The Philosophic Sources of The Guideof the Perplexed, in The Guide, p. xcviii) that here Maimonides comes close — Pines' phrase is "perilously close" — to identifying God with Spinoza's "attribute of thought." But not to Spinoza's attribute of extension, and I believe that everything else in Maimonides — including his discussion of ethics in the strict sense — is based on this distinction. Furthermore, for Spinoza, as there is no distinction between human beings and other species. Divinity resides in all beings equally, in fish and in human beings. This is not true for Maimonides. Maimonides' ethics rests on a distinction between, if you will, God and matter, between the ultimately refined and the ultimately crass. In a sense, good is what corresponds to what is divine in Maimonides. Bad corresponds to what is anti-divine, if you will, matter. Many passages can be adduced to support this. For Maimonides the heavens are not the earth. They are in fact constructed of different</page><page sequence="13">Maimonides and Spinoza XVII was the nature of Spinoza's quarrel with the ancients, and how did this quarrel manifest itself in his teaching about Good (and evil)? It might be well to keep in mind what has been pointed out time and again: once you accept Spinoza,s definition of substance (as well as the six definitions and seven axioms in the beginning of Part One of the Ethics), everything follows. His whole system is in fact grandly conceived, carefully planned, and is carried out in an exemplary, precise fashion. If God is everything, then God is nothing. If God is both thought and body, or intellect and matter, then the term God ceases to be a meaningful concept.51 Maimonides never says it this way, but I believe that what I have just asserted is in harmony with Maimonides' position, and it is with this fundamental Maimonidean enterprise (the separation of God from the world) that Spinoza quarrels. Although Spinoza does not mention Maimonides by name, it is clear from the language of the scholium to Proposition Fifteen of The Ethics that Spinoza is thinking of Maimonides when he criticizes those who deny that God is corporeal.52 God is corporeal, and there is no reason to assert that matter is unworthy of him. Among other things, God is most definitely matter. material and the two domains are inhabited by two totally different beings. For Spinoza the world is one, as it is (in no small part due to Spinoza) in modern science, and there is no distinction between the heavens and the earth. Their elements are identical. This formulation of Spinoza's determines as well man's place in the new universe which Spinoza inhabits. Maimonides inhabits a different universe, one in which the one creature that unites the two domains, or which has access to both domains, is man, and that determines his way of life and his understanding of good (and evil). Man bridges the nether world and the sublime world. It is perhaps an uncomfortable position to be in, in many respects. But it is not the position in which Spinoza places man. In regard to this fundamental issue, as in regard to so many other ones, Maimonides and Spinoza are poles apart. On this aspect of Spinoza's thought and its ramifications, see James Collins, "God, Idea of, 1400-1800," Dictionary of the History of Ideas (New York: Scribner's, 1973) III, 350f. He says, "First, the opponents think that corporeal substance, insofar as it is a substance, is made up of parts, and so they deny that it can be infinite, and consequently that it can pertain to God. ...They say that if corporeal substance is infinite, suppose it to be divided into two parts. Each of these parts will be either finite or infinite. If the former, then the infinite is made up of two infinite parts, which is absurd. If the latter, then there is an infinite which is twice as great as another infinite, which is also absurd." Spinoza, The Ethics and Selected Letters (ed. S. Feldman; Indianapolis St Cambridge: Hackett Press, 1982) 40-1. Cf. The Guide, passim, and esp. I, 55-58. See also Sylvain Zac, "Spinoza, critique de Maimonide," LesEtudes Philosophiques (1972), pp. 411 -428. Zac notes that Spinoza and Maimonides have some common themes, but always with "un sens different." Contra such readings as Harvey's (see above, no. 50), Zac notes, "En surtout, ce qui est certain, c'est que Spinoza lui-meme, loin de manifester une sympathie quelconque pour Maimonide, lui est franchement hostile." And, Zac correctly notes that Spinoza takes every precaution to distinguish the rationalism of the "true philosophy" from</page><page sequence="14">XVIII Aryeh L. Motzkin Now we know that all previous philosophy (with the exception of Epicurus, Zeno and and their respective followers) could not see its way to reducing mind or intellect to matter, or vice versa. That is primarily true of the Platonists (old or new), but it is equally true of the Peripatetics. There is, so they all asserted in different ways, a basic dichotomy in the cosmos, a fundamentally unbridgeable chasm.53 Furthermore, and that is of specific interest to us, these two irreducible spheres are not equal in dignity. The intellect is immortal, the body is mortal. Aristotle's final cause is certainly superior to the rest. Indeed, as the Stoics would have said, form is superior to matter. Few have called these postulates into question during the two millenia that separate Plato from Spinoza. Since, however, only what is eternal can be perfect, and so what comes-into being and passes away is obviously imperfect, it was clear — prior to Spinoza — that the intellect, being incorruptible, is good, and matter, by definition the domain of the corruptible, is evil. If this sounds Neo-Platonic, this is only because the Neo-Platonists, even Plotinus, but certainly Proclus, worked it out in a systematic fashion.54 But in fact nothing that is outlined here may not be the false rationalism of Maimonides, which for the latter serves only, according to Spinoza, to mask his own philosophic prejudices. In a later study, "A Portrait of Spinoza as a Maimonidean," Journal of the History of Philosophy 19 (1981), pp. 151-172, Harvey continues in his quest to paper over the enormous chasm which separates Spinoza from Maimonides. It is not clear why he relies on such uneven philosophizers (to use del Medigo,s favorite term) as Leon Roth, who asserted that "Maimonides and Spinoza speak throughout with one voice." Roth was long ago answered by Leo Strauss in his Spinoza's Critique of Religion (p. 297, n. 238): "If Spinoza and Maimonides agree on anything it is because they are philosophers." Harvey notes that Maimonides is often seen as having had a "formative influence" on Spinoza, but not a "distinctive influence" on his philosophy. "How reasonable," asks Harvey (p. 155), "is the second point in light of the first?" The answer is, quite reasonable. What is meant by the first assertion is that Spinoza read Maimonides attentively, and his reading undoubtedly helped himform his own thoughts (thus, "formative.") It does not follow from this that Spinoza's developed philosophy has Maimonides' imprint on it ("distinctive influence"). Spinoza could have, indeed did use Maimonides. Spinoza could also have, indeed did, reject Maimonides. Harvey's further assertion (p. 163) that both Maimonides and Spinoza denied the notion that the universe has any final end outside itself (or God) (Compare Ethics I, app., The Guide III, 13, Physics II, 7, 198a and On the Generation of Animals 1,1,715a) does not hold. Maimonides indeed states that the final end of the universe is God. But, and this is crucial, the universe and God are not one and the same for Maimonides, as they are for Spinoza (see n. 50 above.) In Plato, the division is between the world of Forms and the material world. In Aristotle, there is a further division between the sub-lunar and the heavenly realm. See, e.g., Plotinus, Ennead II, iv, 16: Is matter, then, also evil because it participates in good? Rather, because it lacks it. (translated by A.H. Armstrong in vol. II, p. 149 of the six volume edition of Plotinus [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979].) Cf. also Ennead V, ix, 10: ...there is no question of an ideal archetype of evil: the evil of this world is begotten of need, privation, deficiency, and is a condition peculiar to Matter distressed and to what has come</page><page sequence="15">Maimonides and Spinoza XIX found in Plato's dialogues (or in his epistles), nor would it have been disputed by Aristotle.55 Now, as we have noted above, the one being which more than any other represents this dichotomy is man, who is the only union of the eternal with the corruptible, and classical morality — I have selected Maimonides as a spokesman of classical morality — is grounded upon this dichotomy. The very definition of morality as the science of the control of man's animal nature, the science whose end is to facilitate man's intellectual perfection, adumbrates this notion of the universe.56 When Spinoza overturns this ancient dichotomy of mind and body, he overturns classical morality as well. What friction there is in the world, the world of nature as well as the world of man (this distinction is in itself anathema to Spinoza), is not born of the desire for perfection (the love of becoming for being, as Aristotle put it57). This is not the endless eternal battle of good trying to overcome evil, that is to say, of mind trying to overcome matter, or more precisely, of matter trying to be overcome by mind.58 In short, there is no longer any justice, according to Spinoza, distinct from the way things work themselves out. Large fishes devour small fishes. That is just, because that is the way of the world. That is also the way of man. When the strong overcome the weak, that is into likeness with Matter. See, contra, Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, II, iii, 17ff.: For nought so vile that on the earth doth live / But to the earth some special good doth give, / Nor aught so good but strain'd from That fair use / Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: / Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; / And vice sometimes by action dignified. Metaphysics 988al4; Physics 192a 16-24; where matter is identified with the ugly, and as the contrary to the divine, good and desirable. The origin of this outlook is indeed Platonic, in fact Pythagorean, but Aristotle, although sometimes clearly uneasy with it, can not find his way to put in place of the identity of matter and evil any other scheme. See also Metaphysics 985a 1-10, where the implication is that matter is evil, since matter is the cause of multiplicity or strife, and strife, according to Empedocles, who is here quoted with approval, is bad. See especially Metaphysics, end of Lambda. (XII, 10, from 1075a 25 down.) Notwithstanding his critique of the pre-Socratics, Aristotle canot but end Lambda with the Homeric dictum that "The rule of many is not good; let there be one ruler." Iliad II, 204) The metaphysical analogue to the rule of the demos is the rule of the hyle. Cf. Nicomachean Ethics, II, 6 1106b 28-35, where Aristotle makes a connection between the Pythagorean identification of evil with the unlimited and his own assertion that men are good in one way, bad in many. All this, of course, in order to lay the proper groundwork for Book X.

Motzkin just.59 Man is no longer a creature distinctfrom fishes. Man and fishes are divine in equal measure.60 They both share in God in the same way because they are both contained in God. What is morally good? To do anything you have the power to do. So Tractatus Theologico-Politicus 16,2.

And further down: That is to say, in a natural state there is nothing which can be called just or unjust... Justice and injustice, therefore, sin and merit are external notions, and not attributes. This is the origin of all modern relativism, and ultimately, after several transformations, of all nihilistic ethics.61 Spinoza learned his metaphysics from Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius. Unlike Epicurus, however, whose well-known dictum was λάθε βιώσας, live in a retired fashion,62 i.e., away from the political community, Spinoza was distinctly political.63 Together with Maimonides, Spinoza believed that the political community cannot, indeed should not, be shunned. Maimonides, following his Greek and Arab masters, believed that society must be gently re-formed, and that only to assure that it does not take on a bestial character.64 Spinoza, in spite of his recognized disdain for the general run of mankind, actually believes in the perfectibility of man. If the masses are ignorant, if they are in the dark about what the good really is, that is only because they have been kept in the dark by those who were in authority during what in fact we call "the Dark Ages:" the functionaries of established religion.

From the man he most admired, Niccolo Machiavelli. Spinoza's teaching of good and evil is indeed Machiavellian.66 Spinoza was the first philosopher to dare to praise Machiavelli publicly.67 Hobbes could not bring himself to do it, and Bacon's praise, in The Advancement of Learning, is far more gingerly, and in fact is in reference to a different matter altogether.68 Spinoza's reference is to the Discourses, Machiavelli's commentary on Livy.69 Indeed, in Part 1, chapter 58 of the Discourses, which Machiavelli titles "The Masses are more knowing and more constant than the Prince," he says outright: "should there be masses regulated by laws, there will be found in them the same goodness as we find in kings." and further: "More virtue will be found in the populace than in the prince." Spinoza's source, Machiavelli's philosophy,70 is as alien to Plato's lover of wisdom as the true ruler and to Maimonides' disdain of the many as "those who walk in darkness" as can be. Contra Spinoza, Maimonides asserts that the connection of the many to the good is accidental. For Spinoza, on the other hand, the severance of the many from what is good and virtuous is accidental and an historical quirk. How remote all this sounds from all previous philosophy, as Machiavelli was the first to note71 is immediately recognizable. The classical view (which Maimonides shared) of the ambiguity of man's nature, made for a tension between the "good" and the "useful."72 What is good simply (or adsolutely) was Voltaire Letter to M. d'Alembert, Nov. 28, 1762. Arising from the identification of good and useful or expedient first encountered, i.e., first openly defended by a respectable thinker in The Prince, ch. VIII, ch. XV. That the good is equivalent to the expedient or useful was of course not first asserted by Machiavelli. Socrates, in his presentation of Protagoras' "phenomenology," shows that the identification of the good with the useful leads to relativism and then proceeds to show that Protagoras' relativism denies all possibility of moral science. See Theaetetus, 152ff., esp. 162e and 172a-b. See Spinoza, Tractatus Politicus, V, 7, where Spinoza praises Machiavelli as a great lover of liberty. See also Tractaus Politicus X, 1. Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning, in The Works of Francis Bacon, ed. Spedding, Ellis and Heath (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1881), pt. Ill, p. 327. "So that we are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that write what men do and not what they ought to do." Bacon goes on, "without this [knowledge of "all forms and natures of evil"] virtue lieth open and unfenced." Spinoza, "the last of the Medievals," knew that any predecessor of his dating from the last medieval century would have been more subtle and more theoretical in an "exegetical" work. See Harvey C. Mansfield, Jr., Machiavelli's New Modes and Orders (Ithaca, NY,: Cornell University Press, 1979), pp. 69ff., 186. I am using Aristotelian terminology. Machiavelli The Prince chaps. XV and XXV.

What is evil corresponded to or led to the irrational, to the corruptible domain. The "useful" was seen by Maimonides, as by the classical philosophers, as belonging to the domain of necessity. "Useful" described anything or any act which made it possible for man to wend his way more easily through the evil world, the world of coming-to-be and passing away. Spinoza, just as Maimonides, sees "the human things" in the light of his view of the things of nature. As the kosmos, or God, is monistic, so is the world of man. For Spinoza, there is no distinction between the kosmos noetos, the intelligible kosmos, and the kosmos aisthetos, the perceivable kosmos, because there is no distinction between the noeta and the aistheta, the data of the intellect and the data of the senses.73 Ultimately, there would be no distinction between the man who dedicates his life to the world of the noeta, the lover of wisdom, and those for whom the world of the nous does not exist — the rest of mankind. As Spinoza abolished the distinction between these domains (and this corresponded to his abolition of the distinction between the sub-lunar world and the quintessential world in physics), he also abolished the distinction between the "good" and the "useful," and he says so explicitly: "By what is good I understand what is useful to us."74 That is of course a species of Epicureanism:75 ultimately the good must be identified with the pleasant. Of course we know what the Epicureans meant by pleasure, by the highest pleasure: they meant philosophy. But, as noted before,76 the Epicureans, i.e., the classical Epicureans, were not public-spirited. Spinoza may be seen as the founder of neo Epicureanism, which differs from its ancient progenitor by its insistence on the political, in fact, by its insistence on the politically radical. Spinoza was "the last of the medievals" in one very important way: the best man is still the philosopher. To be sure, the right kind of philosopher, or I should say of philosopher-scientist (the distinction between philosophy and science had not yet been made). A philosopher-scientist who does not bother with final causes, which are but "human fictions."77 A philosopher-scientist whose own See above, η. 58. The Ethics, Part IV, Definition 1. Cf.

The Assimilation of the good to what is useful is Stoic doctrine. Spinoza clarifies it by explaining that seeking what is useful to oneself is tantamount to seeking to preserve one's being. All this may be summed up in the statement that the good is the affirmation of one's being and the effort to preserve it." See n. 63.

He is down to earth; his interest is in the useful, not the noble or edifying. Maimonides would have been amazed to find anyone believing that power over nature, rather than wisdom, would lead to happiness, i.e., that there could be a neutral physics. Of course Spinoza was right at least in this. Spinoza's (and others') transformation of the original senses of good and evil did lead to the success of the modern enterprise. Man is now able to manipulate nature. Did man's newly acquired power make him master of his fate in any serious sense?
