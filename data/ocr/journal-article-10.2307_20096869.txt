International Studies 5 (1979), 248-259 Printed in Great Britain 248 Britain's elusive role in world politics* CHRISTOPHER HILL Generalisation about foreign policy is inevitable. It is the external face of a country, turned toward the world and taken by others to characterize the society behind it. Politicians and commentators continually search for ways in which to describe the essence of their nation's foreign policy, partly for themselves, and partly to convey its direction and values to interested parties at home or abroad. One of the most natural and time-honoured solutions they have hit upon has been the concept of 'role'. Most of us probably believe that the notion of a state's role in world affairs is simply a convenient shorthand with limitations that can be transcended when the need arises for more detailed analysis. By contrast it will be argued here that the concept tends to bring with it a package of assumptions and images which are at best worth more careful scrutiny and which at worst can be facile or misleading. Foreign policy in the round can hardly be made sense of without some recourse to the terms of roles and personification (just as clear expression requires the use of 'Russia', cBonn' and the like). But this language is not entirely neutral. Rather it reflects an overall view of international relations, questionable in terms of both its accuracy and its policy implications. If this is so then Britain has been a main culprit in abusing the language of world politics. In recent times her policy-makers have at one and the same time held it to be a basic truth that Britain should seek out a new role, and been unable to settle on which identity to adopt. Entry into Europe has only resolved the dilemma at a superficial level, since uncertainties of intellectual outlook and psychological commitment remain, the consequences of deep political divisions over application to the Community in the first place. Accordingly, this paper, focusing on the idea of'role' in the context of British foreign policy, will examine : (i) The characteristics of the 'role' perspective on foreign policy; (ii) Its appropriateness for contemporary Britain; (iii) The problem of an alternative: how else should we organize our thinking about the general character of British foreign policy ? (i) The role perspective In itself the notion of a crole in the world' is hardly complex. Indeed it is the very imprecision and metaphorical quality of the concept which * This article is based on a paper preposed for Chatham House's 'British foreign policy to 1985' research project.</page><page sequence="2">J979 WORLD POLITICS 249 most makes it worth attention. Thus, although a role may be obviously defined as the sum of a country's external policies over a period of time (say a generation), the vantage-point of the observer is of more than usual importance when it comes to more particular definitions. Roles lie in the eye of the beholder, since they refer largely to a state's perceived identity, which varies between the conceptions held by decision-makers themselves, those held by outsiders, and those reached by historians with the benefit of hindsight. As an example of how these views need not coincide, we may take the case of the Soviet Union between the wars, which was seen by Moscow as an embattled defender of socialism against hostile forces, by many foreign governments as the diabolical inspiration of conflict within their own societies, and which on a longer perspective could be seen as the chrysalis of the relatively conservative superpower which was to emerge. When these three levels get out of phase in this way mutual misconceptions easily occur between states, and traditional definitions of a country's role (such as Britain's cpragmatist' self-image) may take precedence in the confusion. An added complication is the tendency by all parties to blur their descriptive and prescriptive uses of the term crole'. Equally important are the distinctions of context which must be made if talking about a role is to have any utility. At its simplest, states may operate in different ways in the various functional areas - economic, political, cultural, et al. - as Willy Brandt's famous comment about West Germany being as "economic giant but a political pygmy" indicates. Taken to its limits this can mean that a country may have special roles in all the many aspects of its external relations ; a Times headline in 1975 asserted "Britain can still play a positive world role in human rights" 1 (if, by implication, in little else). But this is to use the term as a virtual synonym for 'policy', to be qualified only by the relevant functional adjective. It ducks out of the problem of aggregating the many separate strands of policy, which the concept of role does raise. Two distinctions which are not entirely self-defeating, however, are those of rank and geography. Whether we like it or not, international relations is partly conducted on the basis of a league table' of power (another intangible commodity), and states are variously seen as superpowers, great powers, major powers, middle range powers, 'small states', status quo powers, revisionist powers, etc. An individual state continually has to consider whether it wishes to live up its to current image or seek out an alternative elsewhere on the scale. Usually this is not regarded as a matter for conscious choice, but something to be left to the forces of history. The same applies to geography, in that there are always questions simmering below the surface as to the physical scope of foreign policy; should it be isolationist, regional, continental, or global? The dilemmas faced by Britain over the withdrawal from Empire and the fnot necessarily consequent) turn to i. The Times, 10 December 1975.</page><page sequence="3">250 Britain's elusive role in October Europe, highlight the importance of decisions about geographical roles. In some senses then, assessing Britain's foreign policy in terms of a role is unavoidable, perhaps even profitable. It enables us to capture something of the historical direction of policy, beyond the twists and turns of current affairs, while also encouraging attempts to relate horizontally the many particular strands of policy. Almost by defini tion 'foreign policy' itself is an umbrella term, subsuming decisions on arms procurement, trade, aid and international organizations, as well as a host of bilateral diplomatic relations, and its use implies the same belief in a broad orientation governing individual decisions as do looser references to 'roles in the world'. Unfortunately the quest for a unique role, like the pursuit of the Holy Grail, is a fatal distraction to politicians with responsibilities. There are a number of reasons for this. First, there are implications of 'make-believe' about the idea of a role. Traditionally roles are assumed for the benefit of an audience, and played out on stage. The theatrical metaphor is familiar but here it is misplaced. If states do not have personalities, even less do they have personae which can be used to cover up reality. With the exception of short-term manoeuvres by the economically weak to disguise their vulnerability, or by the aggressive to conceal their ambitions, few states wish or expect to be able to practice systematic deception in international affairs. On the other hand politicians do themselves often use the language of drama, and are undoubtedly concerned for appearances and image-making. A sensitivity to 'world opinion' in fact denotes a concern for high-level public relations which in turn can mean that the general appearance of the country to other members of the international system can become more important to decision-makers than the down to earth problems with which they have to deal. It can be aigued that France displayed this tendency in foreign policy in a number of phases of modern history, as have some leaders of developing countries, such as Nkrmah, Nasser, Nehru and Echeverr?a, and other examples are not difficult to find. Perhaps the use of all metaphors in political analysis is loose and hazardous, especially for men of affairs. The simplifications of thought organized round such 'theories' as containment, appeasement, domino, and the family of conspiracy interpretations, are only too fresh in the memory. The idea of role has less spectacular associations than any of these but the perspective it represents is just as artificial. Aside from the charge of anthropomorphism, it contains a crude picture of inter national relations as a system. For to talk of states as having individual, distinctive roles, whether as a 'balancer' of power, a 'manager' of detente, or a 'free-rider' on the efforts of others, is to perpetuate the old board-game picture of diplomacy, where the object of foreign policy is simply to maximise 'security' and 'power' (however they are to be measured) by such Machiavellian strategems as are necessary. This description hardly corresponds to reality, except in the sense that it</page><page sequence="4">!979 WORLD POLITICS 251 helps to create that reality. If statesmen rely on intellectual short-cuts of the 'role' and 'domino' variety, then they will shape the attitudes and debate on the basis of the values contained within them. The concept of national roles in particular, assumes a competitive world where states seek to make their respective singular marks and to find 'places in the sun'. The very concept of a role implies activism, even interventionism. Isolationism is only a role in semantic terms. The point should not be over-stated. Decision-makers are not the simpleminded victims of a poor vocabulary. But in the tide of informa tion that floods modern politics, where even Renaissance Man would be at sea, a resort to generalities is the only alternative to inaction. The metaphors which result inevitably simplify the world, and they can also prolong the life of theories of international relations beyond their merit and period of greatest relevance. In a system where few problems can now be solved unilaterally or even bilaterally, the pursuit of a national role seems especially anachronistic. A further disadvantage of the role perspective is the encouragement which it gives to the stereotyped images (both of self and of others) that are in any case difficult to avoid in international relations. The pro pensity to suppress inconvenient facts within conventional wisdoms, and to evade self-criticism, is as great for foreign policy-makers as it is for individuals in ordinary life.1 The leaders of the USSR still seem sincerely to believe in their role as the guardian of a socialist commonwealth despite the events of 1956 and 1968, and the split with China. It took ten years of disastrous war in Vietnam to shake the belief prevailing in Washington that the USA should act to support all anticommunists on a world-wide basis, and by any means necessary to achieve the end. British and Egyptian convictions that their countries were each at the hub of three interlocking circles of world affairs gave both inflated ideas about their actual capacity to influence events. Quasi-pictorial images of this kind take on a life of their own, and once they become the orthodoxy they are very difficult to shift. When circumstances change but stereotypes do not, then trouble threatens - as Eden found in 1956 with his id?e fixe about appeasement and as Ian Smith has discovered over the last two years in Rhodesia. Both sides in the Middle East have been, and pace Sadat and Begin, they probably still are, trapped inside exaggerated perceptions of the external threat which partly derive from the prevalence of such generalized conceptions as that of Egypt as the inevitable leader of Arab nationalism. An emphasis on image, status and role stands as a barrier to the acceptance of unpleasant realities, of compromise and of change - in other words all the prerequisites of a properly adaptive foreign policy. In summary, although the terminology of role and its associated ideas can perfectly well be used without falling into any of the traps i. Robert Jervis, Perception and Misperception in International Politics (Princeton, 1976) provides voluminous documentation of this point.</page><page sequence="5">252 Britain's elusive role in October outlined here, and while fiascos in foreign policy essentially have more profound causes than mere semantic looseness, there is still a strong argument for criticising conceptions of foreign policy organized around the search for a distinctive role. Roles are too abstract, imprecise and metaphorical. If they refer only to the sum of a state's external relations, then they are truistic. If anything more is implied, by way of some national Zeitgeist, then they are inappropriate and misleading in the contemporary international system. (ii) The British concern for a role in the world Uncertainty about Britain's role in the world has only been a live issue since 1945, and more particularly since Dean Acheson's stinging diagnosis of 1962.1 Up to the Second World War it was generally taken for granted that Britain was and would remain a major world power despite the steady emergence of the USA and to a much lesser extent the Soviet Union. As decolonization gathered pace, however, and as the scale of the nuclear arms race outgrew Britain's increasingly modest means, so the agonising about future status began. The failure of two applications for entry to Europe and the withdrawal from East of Suez heightened the sense of anomie and identity-crisis. A clear change of direction seemed called for if'national morale' was to be lifted. Ostensibly there may seem little reason for concern about British foreign policy being misdirected by adherence to over-simple images of her general role. After all, Britain is not a brash, emerging power like Iran the Shah's, with seductive visions of enhanced future status to woo her away from hard-headed circumspection. On the contrary, however, Britain has been distinctly uneasy about her foreign policy goals in the wake of Imperial disengagement. It is probably not surprising, therefore, that the hankering after a new role has continued. In the context of British foreign policy the pursuit of a settled role no longer means, of course, the advocacy of global responsibilities, far-flung bases, or even the peace-keeping functions dear to Harold Wilson in the first years of the 1964-1970 Labour Governments. A consensus has gradually become established on the irrelevance of such over-weening ambitions to Britain's economic capacity, and indeed to the changed nature of the international system after Vietnam. (In passing, it should be noted that this realization was a long time coming; the East of Suez withdrawal from 1968 was an undignified scramble, which the succeed ing Heath Government at first tried to put into partial reverse.) Contemporary discussions of Britain's role in the world do not, therefore, focus on an attempt to resurrect even the days of Eden or Macmillan (i.e. the period of a surviving world role). What is still current, however, is a concern for some distinctively British niche in world affairs. i. Acheson's remark about Britain having "lost an Empire but not yet found a role" was made in a speech at West Point on 5 December 1962. For a discussion of what flowed from this judgement, seej. Frankel, British Foreign Policy 1945-73 (Oxford, 1975), pp. 151-173.</page><page sequence="6">J979 WORLD POLITICS 253 Acheson's remark about having "not yet found a role" to replace her "played out. . . separate power role" itself perpetuated the belief that Britain could still pursue a unique foreign policy if only her leaders would cast around for a new part with sufficient imagination. This belief has produced two main strategies seen as fitting the bill; both are open to criticism, but they differ radically from each other. The first is based on the argument that Britain has tacitly claimed a special position for herself within the European Community to which she is supposedly committed; that while Europe is now recognised in London as the "area of concentration", UK Governments take a minimalist, even instrumental attitude to the Community, and have no intention of relinquishing Britain's own immediate priorities in favour of a united European strategy. This is seen as a short-run preoccupation with self-interest which in the long run will damage the Nine and hence Britain herself. It is manifest in both internal matters like direct elections or Community finance and in questions of external significance such as fishing, energy and relations with the United States. And given Britain's financial and economic weakness relative to France and West Germany, such behaviour seems to its critics to spell perversity, even hubris. From this viewpoint British foreign policy still seems more tuned in to Washington than to Bonn, Brussels or Paris, and to be seeking, if not fully achieving, a special relationship. Labour leaders in particular have sought to maintain Britain's historical network of connections with both the Americas and the Commonwealth countries. It was, after all, James Callaghan who said in September 1975 that: We have country by country connections throughout the world. We have the experience . . . we have the policy which can enable Britain to make a contribution out of all proportion to our individual size and power to the problems facing the world . . . we may well have found (our) role . . . We are the bridge-builders.1 The sense of superiority to other middle-range powers revealed here, and the view of Europe as only one of several foundations for British foreign policy, is reminiscent of Gaullism, and in this sense, whatever its possible demerits, it certainly constitutes a coherent, distinctive international role. France and Britain do indeed share the same peculiar status : they are nuclear powers, permanent members of the Security Council and with extensive contacts among their ex-colonies, while falling short of the hegemonic role of the USA or USSR. Nor is there any obvious reason why such advantages should be lost in the near to medium term except via the draining away of economic influence, and in Britain's case this may conceivably be staunched by North Sea oil. France and Britain at times have taken sharply different views on policy i. Jim Callaghan, Challenges and Opportunities for British Foreign Policy, Fabian Tract 439, December 1975, p. 10. (Italics in the original).</page><page sequence="7">254 Britain's elusive role in October towards the United States - and Mr. Callaghan and Dr. Owen did enjoy especially intimate relations with the Carter White House - but it can be argued that there is also a strong similarity between the two states' efforts to preserve both individuality and their places as "opening batsmen in the First XI", as Lord Home liked to refer to Britain.1 A policy of benevolent individualism (or Gaullism with a human face) is, therefore, one clear alternative strategy for a Britain sans Empire. The second option is the complete obverse, at least in respect of policy towards Europe. Much of the talk of a new role and of the need to take positive initiatives towards a new international stance refers to the belief that Britain should cut the losses of her attempts to steer a separate path in the 1950s and 1960s, and make a fullhearted commitment to the building of a prosperous, influential and dynamically integrationist European Community. At present, on this view, the residue of a tradi tional parochalism is combining with a nostalgia for past independence, to produce nationalist policies which are Britain's only remaining route of access to 'the top tables' of international discussion. According to the degree of one's conviction about the European idea, a failure to harness national foreign policy to the cause of greater integration can even be seen as flying in the face of history. The clear implications for British foreign policy of a more committed European role are that the Commonwealth connection should finally be allowed to wither away, and that our best endeavours should go towards the creation of a common European foreign policy, partly so as to increase the overall international influence of the member countries but also, as Tindemans argued, "in order to provide the necessary impetus to the dynamic process of European union".2 Relations with the United States should, of course, remain good, but must not be used as a form of leverage against other members of the Community, for, in Edward Heath's words, "only when Europe speaks with one voice will she be sure of attracting the complete attention of the United States".3 Equally, a Nine (or more) united over external policy would present a formidable aspect to every other part of the world. Their industrial strength, extent of markets, and diplomatic influence would be second to none. Actual military power would not be of the same order, but the potential would be unmistakeable. Thus a common European foreign policy could in the long term provide Britain with a clearly defined international role. It might indeed i. Quoted in K. Young, Sir Alec Douglas-Home (London, 1970), p. 191. The Earl of Home also said, in the same 1963 passage: "I believe that Britain has a fine part to play on the world stage. . . . We cannot lead from behind or from the middle ranks - we must be in front". 2.

There would also be the advantage of creating a clear-cut geographical sphere of influence for British foreign policy. Previous ambiguities of concern for both continental and global commitments should at last be resolved. Finally the obvious need for close coordination between domestic and foreign policies would appear to be ideally served by an enthusiastic commitment to Europe. Both of the possible roles available to Britain (namely, that of'bridge builder' on the one hand and positive Europeanist on the other) are plausible and internally consistent, even if they have been cast here largely as ideal types, irrespective of practical difficulties of implementa tion. They share certain characteristics, however, which when examined from the viewpoint of the first part of this paper make each seem rather less attractive. Without restating previous arguments four principal objections can be made: (a) Implicit in each of the two suggested orientations is the assump tion that Britain needs, and is entitled to, an influence over international affairs disproportionate to her strength on conventional indicators of size, population, GDP, etc. If military interventionism on the Korean or Malaysian model is no longer appropriate, Britain must apparently still strive officiously to keep alive the political status that will secure in perpetuity her seat on the Security Council and presence at major economic summits. The Callaghan view of 1975 was robustly certain that "the British people should (not) be satisfied with a foreign policy which sets as its objectives 'damage limitation' and 'low profile polities'," but should capitalise on their powerful and varied assets to help change the world.1 Likewise, a European role, as the Berrill Report accepted, is less likely to diminish Britain's individual influence than to provide an opportunity for halting its decline. And each view is thoroughly compatible with present levels of defence expenditure, which remain proportionately higher than other European members of NATO notwithstanding the complaints of Dr. Luns and his sympathisers.2 Indeed both the independent deterrent and current commitments to BAOR are actually assets on the argument of either strategy. They give some credibility to the claim to ht primus inter pares of the second rank powers, and in the European context they guarantee Britain a major place in the formulation of any joint foreign (or even defence) policies. Such unilateralism cannot be disguised by the rhetoric of either global or regional idealism. As Berrill rightly pointed out, an emphasis on what the outside world can learn from us still persists in much thinking i. Callaghan, op. cit. p. i. 2. In 1975, Britain's defence expenditure at 4*9 per cent of GNP was higher than all other European members of NATO other than the special cases of Greece, Portugal and Turkey. French expenditure stood at 3 9 per cent and West German at 3 7 per cent. (Source : The Military Balance 1976-77, London, International Institute of Strategic Studies).</page><page sequence="9">256 Britain's elusive role in October about British foreign policy.1 But narcissism usually rebounds. While it seems unlikely that the United Kingdom's ecomonic position and hence international status will continue to deteriorate much further, it is equally unlikely that in the foreseeable future she will be anything other than a middleaged industrial country operating on very narrow margins of public expenditure. Given this, it is almost certainly an illusion to suppose that Britain is going to be able to sustain a high profile, high-cost foreign policy of major initiatives on major problems. If she becomes committed to a joint European strategy along such lines, then even the option of a temporary retreat from activism becomes less easy to take. This bring us to the second objection to both putative roles. (b) If in the 1970s Britain is at a general watershed in her history, as is commonly supposed, rather then simply experiencing a switch of direction in foreign policy, the major structural changes which will occur will take place internally, in industrial and social structures, perhaps even in political institutions. It may be that it will take a stimulus from outside, such as entry into Europe may prove in the long term, to precipitate the radical changes which most people of whatever political persuasion agree are necessary. It is this writer's view, however, that too much attention to the external dimension will serve only to complicate and polarise domestic conflicts, just as the issue of relations with Westminster has bedevilled the long-overdue revitalization of Scotland's economy. Moreover although goals set in conjunction with European and/or OECD partners achieve short-term financial stability and an improvement in the balance of payments, they may not be suitable for the treatment of Britain's deeply-rooted special problems of poor industrial relations, under-investment and low productivity, all of which will be exacerbated by the policies of financial restraint (involving high unemployment) inevitably urged on the UK by international economic organizations. A focus on an external role as the leading factor in Britain's reassess ment of herself is, therefore, likely to be a distraction from fundamental domestic change more than a stimulus. Expenditure on defence diverts important resources from domestic projects, while it is by no means certain that Britain's high invisible earnings depend more on a major political role than on, say, financial traditions, 'cultural propaganda' and the high quality of the British educational system.2 Almost more important is the fact that a predominantly external orientation encourages a convergence in the internal policies of different countries, whether in desirable levels of growth or in strategies to beat inflation. i. Sir Kenneth Berrill was Head of the Central Policy Review Staff which produced the Review of Overseas Representation (HMSO, 1977). Here the reference is to paragraph 2.22. 2. Any more than Britain's diplomatic influence depends crudely on her degree of economic strength, which was the assumption made by the Berrill Report so strongly attacked by the Report about Berrill itself issued by the House of Commons Expenditure Committee, viz. : Fourth Report from the Expenditure Committee : The Central Policy Review Staff Review of Overseas Representation (Vol. I, HMSO, 7 March 1978).</page><page sequence="10">x979 WORLD POLITICS 257 Sui generis solutions, which may be the only way to deal with unique historical circumstances and stubborn difficulties, are relegated to the edge of serious debate. Japan is even under pressure for pursuing uniquely successful economic policies. (c) The third objection to pursuing a new role in British foreign policy is that both possible alternatives share a false understanding of history. Both are essentially backward-looking in that, as Professor Ernest May has said about foreign policy-makers in general, "seeing a trend running towards the present, they tend to assume that it will continue into the future, not stopping to consider what produced it or why a linear pro jection might prove to be mistaken".1 The view that sees Britain building on her unique experience and access to different groups of states, for example, is simply over-stated. British credit with a number of ex-colonies is thinner than many politicians like to believe, and with the passing of every year existing ties inevitably become less unique. The relationship with the United States is similarly no longer such a special advantage; West Germany in particular is a close confidant of the Americans. Britain's famous network of commercial outlets has been vulnerable for a long time in the face of competition from the US, Japan, and a growing number of developing states. In other words, an inter national role which appears practical is in fact culled from a yellowing picture of world affairs. In a less obvious way this may also be true of a European role, which is on the face of things a progressive cause. There is already a certain irony in the fact that Britain finally began to look favourably on the EEC at a time when the initial hopes of the founding fathers of the Treaty of Rome were in ruins, and although the present government has not displayed too much naive enthusiasm for renewed integration, those who call for a more positive commitment to European cooperation do clearly assume (i) that nation-states of Britain's size no longer represent really viable units internally and externally, and (ii) that regional organizations like the European Community are the bases of future federal structures. Mr. Heath has explicitly referred to the model of US history.2 Both assumptions may turn out to be correct, but as readings of historical trends they are certainly questionable. As always with an attempt to draw specific lessons from history the temptation to annex the past in support of a passionately-held belief is virtually irresistible. (d) Exclusivity is the last reason why the idea of a British role should be abandoned. Roles are package-deals of ideas which not only suppress contradictions and simplifications in the interests of a central, predominant concept, but also exclude phenomena not caught in their particular net. Thus purist believers in a 'socialist foreign policy' usually prefer not to think about the awkward problem of whether the Soviet i. Ernest R.

Heath, op. cit. p. 13.</page><page sequence="11">258 Britain's elusive role in October Union really does have aggressive designs on the West. It is not a question that their 'paradigm' raises. By the same token Europeanists tend to assume that all foreign policy issues require the formulation of a joint 'European position' and that unity among the Nine is the first priority. This does not allow for occasions on which unity qua Nine may serve little clear purpose (as in the CSCE, where agreement across the board was of much greater importance) or for issues where the formula tion of bloc positions can be obstructive and confrontationist (as with the 1976 stalemate at the Nairobi UNCTAD meeting). A more self consciously flexible role of the bridge-building type would suffer less from this kind of difficulty, but essentially the very idea of a role is wrong, because it is state-centred rather than problem-centred.1 Up until 1914, perhaps, when most states were relatively self-contained economically, and when foreign policy primarily meant matters of territory, security and citizenship, it was logical to take the needs of one's own country as the almost exclusive priority. But contemporary international relations make the pursuit of self-interest a complicated and two-edged affair; little can be achieved by ploughing a lone furrow, however astutely. The 'role in foreign policy' only encourages the illusion that it can. (iii) An alternative approach How then are we to characterise Britain's external relations? Undoubtedly foreign policy consists of more than the sum of the many specific decisions made in its name. The task is to be able to outline criteria for decision-making in British policy, and to allow for elements of coherence and distinctiveness without resorting to airy metaphors or single-factor explanations. There are two stages of discussion which might help achieve this. The first is to focus policy on particular issues and desired outcomes rather than on an ideal power-ranking or image. There is no need to seek excessive consistency when dealing with problems as diverse as MBFR, a mining regime for the seabed, the enlargement of the Community and the transfer of the Falkland Islands to Argentina. Different instruments and fora of policy will be applicable in different circumstances, which should be dealt with on their merits. An attempt to raise too great an umbrella over the various aspects of British foreign policy will simply reduce the general level of illumination, just as the obsession with the 'three circles' interpretation of Britain's role in the 1950s unnecessarily distanced her from the movement towards Western European cooperation, which was not intrinsically incompatible with her other interests. i. The emphasis on problems regardless of state boundaries is of course characteristic of many writers about international relations in the twentieth century. John Burton has been one of the most articulate of recent expositors of this tradition, and in his World Society (Cambridge, 1972), see pp. 108-120 discusses roles and decision-making from this point of view.</page><page sequence="12">1979 WORLD POLITICS 259 The second way in which foreign policy might better be looked at meets a major objection to the first, namely that to judge issues 'on their merits' only begs the question, since similar problems of outlook and principle will regularly crop up and will have to be judged on predict able criteria. This objection is perfectly valid, but it does not mean that we should be driven back to conceptions of a general role. Far more preferable is to look beyond the relatively narrow field of diplomacy to the basic political philosophy from which decision-makers' attitudes derive. If generalisation about 'our foreign policy' is unavoidable, then so is recognition of the fact that a decision in foreign policy is always a political act, furthering some particular desire about the shape of the world and the individual country concerned, just as with domestic decisions. And this is how it ought to be. Policy-makers need to have thought-out criteria with which to assess events and proposals. They should not be, as has been said of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so busy with work as to have no time to query its purpose.1 Furthermore, aspirations for international relations should be, and almost always are, outcrops of political beliefs about domestic society.2 It was not difficult to predict someone's attitude to the question of entry into Europe from their views on British politics (although not from their party loyalty alone). The kind of international relations we hope for depends on the kind of society we want Britain to become, and vice-versa. Problems arise when these two sets of goals conflict, as they sometimes do, and there are no fixed rules for deciding them, but we stand a good chance of pursuing both with some realism if foreign policy is not hived off into its own arcane world and language. Instead it should be thought through from first principles as part of a coherent political outlook. Fundamentally, after all, international relations constitutes a highly complex system that can hardly best be explained through the medium of limp metaphor or rhetoric. And to act on the basis of faulty understanding is by general agreement the surest of all roads to chaos. i.
