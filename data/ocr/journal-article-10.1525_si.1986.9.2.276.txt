On  numerous occasions Mead raised the claim that “Socialism presented at least for some  decades the goal that society must contemplate, whether it will or not [be] a democratic  society in which the means of expressions and satisfactions are placed at the disposal of  the members of the whole community”(Mead Papers, box 2, addenda, folder 27). Given  the author’s interest in the democratic socialist rereading of Mead and pragmatism, he  could have benefited from the analysis of the unpublished political works of Mead.  Perhaps that is a task for the future.  It is impossible to do justice in a brief review to many fine aspects of this book. One  final point 1 want to make is that Joas has written an important work that is bound to  become required reading for Mead scholars and is likely to be a valuable source for all  sociologists, interactionists and noninteractionists alike who are interested in the inter-  play between politics and social theory.

Five Bodies: The Human Shape of Modern Society  By John O’Neill  Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985  Reviewed by John P. Hewitt, University of Massachusetts at Amherst  Sociology, among its many guises and embodiments, is an extended commentary on the  modern world. Its theoretical and research apparatus has been shaped by the intellectual  and moral responses of its practitioners to the social transformations wrought by capital-  ism, industrialism, the growth of cities-in short, by the transformation of society by  what we too glibly call modernity. Far from being merely the science that many would  like it to be, sociology is an integral part of the culture and social structure of modern  society, an expression of its ethos as well as an instrument of its social arrangements.  Critical theorists such as John 0’Neill would agree with the foregoing but would find  it stated too mildly. Sociology, they might say, not only expresses the culture of moder-  nity but is integral to its production and reproduction; and it serves, through its provi-  </page> <page sequence="2"> Review Essays 277  sion of research methods, findings, theories, and pedagogy, not simply as a neutral  instrument but as an active agency whereby the corporate state and the therapeutic  society attain and maintain their dominance. The critical theorist who takes this stand  about ordinary social science, however, is likely to make an exception for critical theory  itself, which is seen as standing apart from the crowd of scientific oppressors, an intellec-  tual movement “critical” of established institutions and therefore innocent of the oppres-  sive production and reproduction of social order and ideology.  But critical theory-of which this book is an example-can be viewed, much as any  other sociological effort, as a text that produces and reproduces the culture of modernity  and not simply as an analysis of it. Like any other work, O’Neill’s deserves scrutiny as a  set of substantive claims about the nature of modern life, claims that can be evaluated  against standards of evidence as well as of theoretical clarity and conceptual sense. It is  also a text that inadvertently reproduces the culture in which it was written. Its critique  of modern society, although presented as a diagnosis of problems that critical intelligence  may one day solve, is a reflection of deeper, conflicting impulses and meanings in the  culture of modernity.  The news about O’Neill’s substantive claims about modern society is both good and  bad. On the positive side, O’Neill treats the human body as a metaphor for thinking  about society, advocating a “radical anthropomorphism” that attempts to rethink the  future of society from a human-centered point of view. O’Neill regards the human body  as “ . . . an intelligent and critical resource in the anthropomorphic production of those  small and larger orders that underlie our social, political, and economic institutions.” We  can, he says, “ . . . rethink institutions with our bodies,”and he stresses the importance of  the body not as a thing in conflict with society or as a bundle of impulses to be tamed but  as an instrument of social purposes and meanings and as u.. .the most fundamental  bond between the self and society.” Whereas our human ancestors could, in his words,  “think the universe through their bodies,” we moderns are forced to “think systems and  structures without embodied subjects.” We are, in other and perhaps more familiar  terms, alienated from the social world that we and our ancestors created, a world that  once had human shape and scale-an “anthropomorphic” universe, social world, and  body politic-but that increasingly oppresses because it bends men and women to its  shape rather than accepting theirs. A radical anthropomorphism would return us to  human ways of thinking about ourselves and the world; it would make humankind,  embodied humankind, the measure of society; and it would assign the family, that  elemental social unit, a crucial place in this rethinking of politics, consumerism, medi-  cine, and all our human institutions. OWeill’s conception of modern society is thus of a  human creation that has apparently outstripped human nature, at least in the sense that  the human shape is rapidly being removed from human institutions. “We are,” he writes,  “no longer reflected in our work, our institutions, or our environment.”  There is much in O’Neill’s book that a pragmatist can admire. Human beings are  naturally active creatures engaged in contacting and manipulating their environment. It  is their efforts that lend the world, physical and social, its shape and significance. They  are practical creatures whose common sense and native intelligence are too readily  slighted by sociological theories that make the person merely a thrall of society and deny  any capacity for innovative and adaptive responses to human circumstances. They are  embodied creatures who do not experience merely an abstract social and moral order, as  </page> <page sequence="3"> 278 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 9/No. 211986  O’Neill points out, but an embodied world, a world of flesh and blood, of real and  concrete human beings who contact and collide with one another. Moreover, it is, as  O’Neill might say, a “familied world,” one in which the social milieu provided by the  human family provides the first experience of the social world, the first platform for the  construction of self, and, in some sense, the model on which people subsequently con-  struct the larger and more complex social realities in which they live.  There is a sense then in which O’Neill’s version of critical theory is not only agreeable  from a pragmatist’s perspective but makes a fundamental point in which the pragmatist  might well join: By viewing human beings merely as passive recipients of social and  cultural influence, social science exerts a “dehumanizing” influence, providing not a  neutral description of what human life is like but a source of legitimation for the further  dehumanization of humankind by whatever agencies that might seek to exploit or  control us.  There is, however, also some bad news about this book: It is long on metaphor and short  on detailed analysis. It relies too much on its author’s command of the elegant sentence (it  is very well written, if frequently elliptical) and too little on the systematic exposition of its  main ideas. It is filled with potentially useful images-that we can rethink society with our  bodies, for example-that are, in the final analysis, left to stand as suggestive images rather  than given sufficient detail to make their meaning plain. The major concepts and ideas are  given to us in the manner of the impressionist, an approach that conveys a plausible and  attractive image when looked at from a distance but that dissolves into bits of unexpected  colors and shapes when inspected more closely. The intellectual eye of the reader must do  too much of the author’s work of showing us what is in his mind, for too little is conveyed  with precision. Moreover, although O’Neill relies extensively on the work of others to  buttress his analysis, his use of their work does not effectively add to or clarify it. For the  most part, one would profit more by reading his sources than by reading his book. Finally,  although the book draws our attention to the problems of “modern society,”its illustrations  frequently take “American society”as the epitome of modernity and its evils. But ONeill  displays no close knowledge of American culture or the realities of American society, and  his illustrations frequently seem like caricatures.  What about critical theory as cultural text? Like much explicitly critical sociological  work (which includes much more than work labeled as critical theory), this book is a  warning about and a condemnation of modern society as well as a set of (mostly vague)  prescriptions as to what must be done to set things right. It is a variation on that ancient  sociological theme of the alienation and dehumanization of humankind by modern  society, a variation that distinguishes itself by its use of the body as a principal metaphor  of analysis but otherwise does not stray far from the main images in terms of which  modern society has been criticized. It is essential in evaluating books of this sort to  recognize how integral this critique of modernity has become to the culture of modernity  itself. That is, sociological portrayals of modern society-whether styled as “critical  theory” or not-are not simply neutral and independent commentaries on the modern  state of affairs, nor do they simply sound the alarm and announce what changes are  needed, for they are themselves constitutive of modernity, a part of the very social reality  they seek to describe. Critical theory provides one dialect of a more widely employed  language of social thought in which the experiences of modern life are both expressed  and realized.  </page> <page sequence="4"> Review Essays 279  To say, for example, that human beings of past times “thought the world” with their  bodies and their families-that these were the sources of their categories of thought and  their ways of organizing reality-is to express what is really a variation on the theme of  the increasing scale and complexity of social life captured in Toennies’ metaphor of the  shift from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft, from community to society. Human beings  once lived closer to the enclosing boundaries of organic communities that were smaller in  scale and provided more definitively both for personal identity and the perpetuation of a  stable and widely shared culture. The outer boundaries of social life in the modern world  have expanded to the more abstract and impersonal scale of “society,” and the world of  the organic community has come perilously close to disappering. Life then was warm  and reassuring and on a human scale; life now is cold and impersonal and threatens to  overwhelm. Human beings then could perceive their authorship of their social world,  which was an extension of themselves; now they have lost control and are, in O’Neill’s  view, being remade as extensions of society.  But this sociological theme is a manifestation of the culture of modernity rather than a  good analysis of it, for it expresses in the language of the intellectual only one side of the  experience of life in the modern world, using an image of linear social transformation to  describe what is in fact a far more elusive and “dia1ectical”reality. Modern culture offers  sharply contrasting objects of action and desire: On the one hand, there is the promised  freedom of a society in which people may move as they wish, be individuals responsible  only to and for themselves, construct selves of their own design, and seek futures of their  own choosing. On the other hand, there is the remembered world of organic community,  with its security of place and purpose provided by close and continuous association with  like-minded others, its given identities, and its timeless ways. Moreover, “society,” which  provides the arena in which individuality and autonomy are exercised, is also a large and  frightening place, and it is where those large and powerful structures of state and  corporation are located. And “community,” which is sought for its supportive milieu, is  also recognized as a place where warm traditions easily turn cold and rigid. To be in the  modern world is to experience this sharp sense of contrast between past and future,  security and autonomy, community and society, as well as the many paradoxes integral  to life in either the societal or the communal mode.  In this light, sociological critiques of modern society, which pose as descriptions of ills  and prescriptions for change, are really forms of discourse that partially express and  reproduce modern culture. What they express, however, comes as no surprise to many  modern people, for to be a member of a modern society like the United States is to live  torn between the appealing freedoms of society and the comforting security of commu-  nity. The critical theorist who attacks the scale of modern life, fearing that society, in the  form of the corporation or the state, has become so powerful that human beings must  henceforth cede all control to it and assume whatever shape it demands expresses a fear  that is more deeply rooted in ordinary people. But only a part of their response is  captured, for ordinary people often prefer the autonomy offered by modern society even  as they recognize the limits of individualism, and their efforts to construct or recapture  community are often tempered by the recognition that a community and its traditions  can be every bit as oppressive as the corporation and the state.  The critique of modern society fostered by sociologists, among others, seems to have  become a permanent part of its culture, an intellectual expression of more widespread  </page> <page sequence="5"> 280 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 9/No. 211986  anxieties provoked by the increasing scale and complexity of social life and by the  declining capacity of “society”t o serve as an enclosing unit of any positive meaning in the  construction of personal identity. By the same token, the celebration of the individual  found in Western societies, and especially in the United States, finds its intellectual  expression, among other places, in contemporary humanistic psychology. Here is the  other side of this cultural dialectic, the positive response to the ascendancy of society and  its freedoms over organic community and its limits, Both sides are integral to the culture,  whose essence does not consist simply of individualism (whether seen as benign or as a  raging cancer) or the thorough socialization of the person by state and corporation, but  of a complex texture of contradictory impulses and objects.  In the last analysis, this book fails as a set of propositions about modern life because it  is so thoroughly an expression of the culture of modernity-so caught within contem-  porary critical images of society that it is unable to seem them as the intellectual expres-  sion of underlying cultural tensions that they really are. It presumes to speak in the name  of ordinary people bewildered and oppressed by modern society, but it addresses only  one side of modern life and captures only a fragment of the everyday response to it. Its  failure, like so many other failures of the sociological imagination, is a result of its  readiness to impute meanings to social life and to the experiences of ordinary people  rather than studying those meanings.  Conduct Unbecoming  By Maurice Punch  London/New York: Tavistock, 1985,220 pp., $13.00 (paper)  Reviewed by P.K. Manning, Michigan State University  Symbolic interaction has its roots in the concrete. In part a reflection of its pragmatic  origins, in part a product of historic and somewhat adventitious associations of faculty at  the University of Chicago, and in part because it was shaped by curious people who had  an interest in the variations of the particular, symbolic interactionism is most powerful  when it encounters what is taken to be the “real world.” Notions such as symbol,  collective lines of action, and even sensitizing concepts are seen as referential, of low-level  abstraction, and cautiously theoretical. As Rock (1979) shows, this means a suspicion of  the borrowed paraphernalia of the natural sciences, a formal theorising and of quantifi-  cation. All such commitments rub uneasily against the emerging power of semiotics as  well as the conventional wisdom of statistical induction that dominates the American  Sociological Review, the regional journals of the discipline, and even the American  Journal of Sociology itself. Any attempt to generalize, to compare, and to specify by  drawing on the rich texture of symbolic interactionism will be a somewhat unsettling  exercise, something like drinking a strong cup of espresso before sleep.
