<plain_text><page sequence="1">Great Men, Paradigms, And Scientific Revolutions By JOHN M. BERRY, JR. he writings of the scientist T. S. Kuhn and the historian Thomas Carlyle present views represent- ing seemingly contrasting modes of study in the history of science. Kuhn (1967) introduced the idea of examining science in terms of "paradigms" and "scientific revolutions." Kuhn defines a paradigm as a pervasive mental and technologic framework, enjoying widespread popularity and influencing the development of related scientific works of a lesser nature. According to Kuhn's view, scientific revolu- tions occur within a scientific community as that community shifts from one paradigm to another. Carlyle (1841) viewed history in terms of "great men" and the influences they exert. His idea repre- sents an alternative in studying the history of sci- ence. Some historians accept Carlyle's views; others dismiss the idea that so-called great men could in- dividually divert the course of history. In comparing the ideas of these two men in light of present scientific developments, conflicts occur. For example, what is the real role of a Charles Darwin-or, in our time, of a James D. Watson- in establishing trends in science? Also, what rela- tionship exists between scientists and the social and intellectual climates within which they work? These ideas are important for a biology teacher of today to examine. In June 1968 a group of college teachers attending a History of Biology-Institute at Ohio State Uni- versity listed their choices of great men responsible for influencing the development of current thinking in the biologic sciences. At the top of their list was Aristotle; next came Darwin, Mendel, Linnaeus, and Pasteur, in that order. (See accompanying table for ranking of other names listed.) These choices, if considered as a list of possible "great men" in bi- ology, contain paradoxes. Aside from Linnaeus and Aristotle, each held views in almost direct opposi- tion to the views of his contemporaries. Yet today these men have considerable status and are recog- nized as outstanding biologists. Perhaps worth not- ing, too, is the fact that each of them was trained in a discipline other than that in which he made his major scientific achievements (Darwin in theology, Mendel in mathematics, Pasteur in physics). Fur- thermore, each experienced, at one time or another, only limited scholastic success. Still, today we ac- claim them as having been highly successful: we say they are scientists who have shaped our thinking. Three Guiding Questions I wish to consider the influence of these men, in light of the ideas of Carlyle and Kuhn. Let us con- sider these questions: 1. Are Kuhn's ideas of any value in linking key persons with major trends in biology? 2. Who or what establishes scientific trends? Can we legitimately credit persons with creating new trends? 3. What are the implications of Carlyle's vs. Kuhn's views in terms of the students in biology classes today? I first began considering these questions at the 1968 History of Biology Institute at Ohio State Uni- versity. Present at that institute were many excel- lent historians of science as well as teachers. The atmosphere was productive, and ideas began emerg- ing. To the list of great men compiled at the OSU in- stitute, I added two other lists, made by counting name citations in indexes of history-of-science and history-of-biology textbooks (see table). A study of the three lists tended to challenge Carlyle's ideas Author's address: Biology Dept., Wilbur Wright College, 3400 N. Austin Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60634. 345</page><page sequence="2">about great men. First, the names proposed by the college teachers at the institute were quite as diverse as were the teachers themselves-people who were teaching courses ranging from freshman biology to advanced and highly specialized courses. The in- dividual lists of the OSU participants showed, for example, that a teacher of premedical courses had named Von Helmholtz and Hippocrates, while geneticists had frequently named Mendel and Mor- gan. Teachers of other subjects followed related and similar trends. Other aspects of the individual lists were inter- esting, too. The classical biologists Leeuwenhoek, Vaselius, Galen, and Robert Hooke were given com- Comparison of three listings of great men in biology.

Yet-warranted or unwar- ranted-James D. Watson was named sixth highest by the teachers surveyed. Clearly, status accorded by teachers and by textbooks can differ; and the textbooks often differed from each other, as well. The listings in the table seem contradictory. If there are great men who determined the directions taken by the scientific community, why is there so much difficulty in naming them? Further, why do biology teachers differ in naming such men? Also, why are there multiple entries (for example, Schleiden and Schwann) ? Lastly, why is Watson ranked so high, even though in his own book (1968) he severely deprecates his own work? These ob- servations are not explained by Carlyle's "great men" notion. Some Major Considerations Further examination of the lists, however, does show some major considerations. These are signifi- cant and may be summarized as follows: 1. Recorded history must begin someplace. Books describing the history of science and of biology often begin with Aristotle. (Historians are uncertain about many of man's activities before that.) Doubtlessly, Aristotle's efforts do represent a high point in fusing Greek logic with accurate observations and a keen, intuitive mind. And Aristotle's writings did in- fluence later biologic investigations; for example, Linnaeus, in the 18th century, still considered the basic elements of the universe to be air, fire, water, and earth. Yet, while acknowledging Aristotle's accomplishments, one may still question the absolute "greatness" of this man. In one report he describes a fish as turning itself inside out to escape a fisher- man's hook (Rook, 1964): misconceptions, legends, and folklore had crept into his works. Hence one may ask if Aristotle was truly an untarnished "great biologist" or simply a "right man" at a "right time and place," with whom recorded history could begin. 2. High ranking is also accorded Darwin. The history-of-biology books I consulted put Darwin third, but he was placed first in the list compiled by the people at the OSU institute. Different people at different times have disagreed about the relative status of this "great biologist." One wonders if an important biologist's historical significance does not vary with the time and place of the observer. 3. Next, consider Pasteur and Mendel. Their posi- tions are fairly equivalent in the three lists. Never- theless I wonder how the greatness of these men is rated in books written by French, Austrian, and German authors. Perhaps "great men in history" are influenced by an observer's own biases or modes of perception. 4. It seems the validity of Carlyle's "great man" idea is open to question. Yet the idea of naming significant individuals remains attractive. Nonethe- less, the name of one man significant in biology seldom appears in textbooks. As a teacher of many famous people, this overlooked man, Johannes Muller, surely had a major effect upon biology. I believe that Muller is seldom named because writers of books in biology are often unaware of this man's influence as a teacher of biology. 5. A final objection to the "great man" theory can be raised. In listing his "doublets" or "triplets" of scientific discovery, Merton (1961) cited examples of simultaneous but independent findings by dif- ferent persons, as follows: The cell concept: Schleiden and Schwann. Chromosome theory: Correns, Tschermek, De- Vries. DNA structure: Crick-Watson, Wilkins-Frank- lin. [Watson has indicated that Linus Pauling may have been close to the same finding at the same time.] Natural selection: Darwin, Wallace. Merton's account appears to deal a fatal blow to the idea of the "great man" in science. These five points suggest serious inconsistencies in past efforts in trying to link history and science. I am convinced that science is not best studied by looking at it backwards. Rather, one must incor- 346 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, SEPTEMBER 1971</page><page sequence="3">porate the Gestalt of that particular time and not hope to explain the past while dwelling only in the present. Thus, I believe that Kuhn's alternative of- fers a better method for the study of past events in biology than does Carlyle's. The Normative and the Unorthodox Kuhn's ideas incorporate both psychologic and sociologic themes. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions he discusses "paradigms," "normal sci- ence," and "scientific revolutions." He discusses them in terms of scientific institutions. Kuhn describes a paradigm as an accepted framework that is tem- porarily in vogue. A paradigm, he says, is a set of quasistandard themes and their by-products (in- strumentation, textbooks, lectures). Kuhn main- tains that much of the activity within any scientific community consists of "normal science," by which he means the resolving of comparatively small prob- lems in the light of major and acceptable paradigms. He acknowledges that normal science is often quite productive: it has solved many problems, especially by people working within scientific institutions. Kuhn suggests, however, that normal science cannot infinitely continue under any one paradigm without eventually finding anomalies in that paradigm. Normal science will thus ultimately lead to a "crisis" -a series of events that challenge the paradigm. Revolutions, or changes in directions of thinking, will then occur as normal science produces the need for a new paradigm. According to Kuhn, a widespread and pervasive theory that has attained "paradigm status" can be rejected-but only if a useful alternative theme is available to replace it. Such a shift may at times occur rapidly and can constitute a "scientific revolu- tion." Khun suggests four such scientific revolutions: Anthropomorphic and the earth-centered universe-- heliocentric universe. Phlogiston theory-*mechanistic model of respiration and of chemical oxidation. Geologic catastrophism-*-uniformitarianism. Newtonian theory-*quantum mechanics. The list is not complete; nor does Kuhn list any biologic paradigms. To the biologist, Kuhn's ideas are worth consider- ing. If one considers Carlyle's great men as only artifacts of the history-writers, one might then in- stead try to incorporate these great men into a model derived from Kuhn's ideas. I believe this is reasonable; and perhaps we may agree that the names Aristotle, Mendel, Darwin, and Pasteur have served to label important paradigms in biology. The terms Aristotelian logic, Mendelian genetics, Dar- winian evolution, and Pasteurization technique may support this idea. (Perhaps other paradigms exist, too, in the more specialized branches of biology: one thinks of the Hippocratic Oath in medicine.) Of the names listed in the table, at least the four just mentioned can, I believe, be closely linked with paradigm shifts. Others might better be considered practitioners of "normal science." For example, did Linnaeus instigate a major revolution in biologic thinking or was he merely a good classifier at a time when many organisms needed classifying? In fact, weren't the anomalies of classification according to the Linnaean system a part of the later "crisis" precipitated by Darwin and Wallace? To my mind, Kuhn's model deals effectively with both past and recent trends in biology. Consider, for example, the idea that great men by their total greatness dictate a flow of events. A better alterna- tive might be that strong-willed, independent think- ers may challenge established paradigms. Such challenges, if they offer viable frameworks for sci- entific research and the impetus for change, may be adopted rather quickly. Historical accounts of Darwin, Mendel, and Pasteur as independent think- ers many cast each of them in the role of challenger of a paradigm; perhaps a related implication is that these men were not formally trained to become "normal" biologists. Their significance may lie not as much in the fact that they created theories de novo but rather that they challenged existing para- digms. Did James D. Watson challenge a paradigm? What was the role of Rachel Carson? Implications for Biology Teachers Now, for teachers in biology, I would like to sug- gest another implication. Kuhn states that we may use textbooks, lab work, and other procedures in- tended to turn out specialized "normal scientists." (A colleague once told me, "We seem to want to treat freshman biology students as potential Ph.D. workers in biology.") In contrast, paradigm-chal- lengers were not suited for "normal science" and did resist that mode. Each encountered difficulties, often in the form of strong academic opposition; however, each was persistent. Kuhn's ideas thus carry several clear implications for biology teachers. It is important that we allow room for the Darwins, the Mendels, and the Pasteurs and not just attempt to educate "normal scientists" only. Perhaps one small way to minimize paradigm- orientation is by the use of historical perspective. For instance, we might ask students to read primary sources, such as Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle. Such readings help define problems from a par- ticular point of view (the Zeitgeist, or spirit of that time); yet as primary sources such readings leave many questions unresolved, and so do not over- lead the student. I suggest also that a responsible teacher ought not to turn out undereducated "normal scientists" who are interested in the current vogue in ecology only. Basic "inquiry learning" instead of lectures and "confirm it" labs could yield better long-term educational results. The real message of Kuhn vs. Carlyle seems clear. What Kuhn calls normal science has a place in our (Concluded on p. 354) GREAT MEN, PARADIGMS, AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS 347</page><page sequence="4">Great Men . . . from p. 347 scientific community. Historically, we should honor both important men and important ideas, but it would be well for us to build more realistic monu- ments to the earlier biologists (and perhaps final resting places for dead paradigms). We should not allow present-day science students to become the victims of the ghosts of paradigms-past or present. Today, ecology has the spotlight in biology. Of course this is important, even vital, to us all; but- given the concept of paradigms-we should look ahead to where the spotlight is likely to fall next. (Personally, I'd bet on the behavioral sciences.) Our job as biology teachers entails, then, two responsi- bilities to our students: to teach some "normal sci- ence," framed in old paradigms, while leaving room for, and even encouraging, the challenging of para- digms. As effective teachers it becomes our mandate to promote both technical competency and free thinking. REFERENCES CARLYLE, T. 1841. Heroes and hero worship. Hall Publishers, London. KUHN, T. S. 1962.
