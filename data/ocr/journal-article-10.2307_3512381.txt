Manuscripts may utilize any social scientific methodology, whether quantitative, ethnographic, historical, or archival.

Additionally, the Review publishes book reviews, and encourages publishers and authors to submit recently-published books for consideration to the Book Review Editor. 209</page><page sequence="4">ANNOUNCING Religious Research Association 2003 Annual Meeting Sheraton Norfolk Waterside, Norfolk, VA October 24-26, 2003 Religion and Contemporary Culture: Exploring the Intersections of Religious Research Religion intersects with a variety of social institutions and categories of lived experience. Reflections on those intersections and their multidimensionalit, raise important questions. How does ethnicity link to religious practice? How do state policies on immigration impact on religious patterns? What is the gendered nature of religion and religious experience? How to religion, gender and race intersect? How do we construct the categories we use to explore these intersections? We invite papers/sessions on the following topics: * methodological challenges in the use of categories * multi-dimensional intersections * women and religious experience * the state and religion * religion and education * social movements and religious activism * religion and law * congregational approaches to diversity Send proposals to: Lori G.
