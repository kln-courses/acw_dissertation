<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURAL RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH ITALY AND THE PROTO-HISTORICAL CIVILIZATIONS OF ASIA MINOR AND THE AEGEUM I here offer a synthesis of the cultural fea? tures that link up the Bronze Age civilization of South Italy with that of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean of the same epoch. In the case of South Italy we have until now available data provided by the archaeological material preserved in the Museums of Taran to, Matera and Bari (1). The data therefore refer exclusively to the proto-historical civili? zation of the Apulia-Materan area. Material is lacking for the study of the relations be? tween the other regions and Asia Minor and the Eastern Mediterranean during the pre classic age. It may be that a careful study of the material preserved in the storehouses of the museums of South Italy would supply further data for the other parts of Magna Grecia also. The first well-known feature of the Eastern pre-classic civilizations are the anthropomor? phic decorations constantly found on the pot? tery of Apulia and Materano (2). Samples of this pottery are given in Fig. 1 showing exam? ples of the several classes or types which I have classified (3) from the technical and de? corative view-points, taking into due account the technique of the decorations. I offer a sample of handles, inspired, as can be seen, by oriental patterns. The anthropomorphic decorations of Apulia are founded on several kinds of pottery and one can safely say that they are all modelled on the four chief types of vases belonging to the civilisation in question, which may be summed up under the following headings: (1) pottery made of a compact resonant clay, the surface polished with a slat (stecca), 276 decorated with geometrical patterns drawn on them after firing. This pottery, which is very plentiful in Apulia, is identical with the An? cient and Middle Bronze age pottery of Cy? prus, found in that island in the shape of tall, narrow-necked flasks, open cylindrical-shaped vases, semi-spherical goblets without a foot (4), one of the typical kinds of pottery found in the so-called grotticella tombs (5) several of which have been found in Apulia in the lands round Matera (objects in the Museum of Ta ranto, fig. 1: a, g, I). (2) Yellow resonant pottery, often painted (6) with simple lineal patterns, in red bands, flame-shaped, on checker-work. There are specimens with geometrical patterns (as for instance, fig. 1: fe? c), often arranged in a meander, a pattern familiar to the designs of all times (7). (3) Pottery made of black clay like that used for the Etruscan bucchero. This pottery belongs to the monochrome types (black and red) found all over the Orient. In Apulia they are found with patterns in dotted bands and in recurrent spirals; the systems used in mak? ing the decorations are those of crude engrav? ing, intaglio, carving the half dry clay, and graffito work executed after firing. The deco? rations are filled in a white substance. The prevailing type is now known as ? appenni nico a term used by Rellini for the civi? lisation which produced this pottery. Anthropomorphic decorations are found on pottery of these classes. A specimen can be seen on the rough notably thick pottery some? times well fired (which was wide-spread in the peri-Mediterranean Neolithic age, decorat</page><page sequence="2">ed with engravings on the crude clay), which displays one of the types. It is the fragment (fig. 2 a), from Molfetta (8) which belongs to this kind of pottery. There is no need of a special description to perceive that the hand? ling of the decoration is identical with that of the specimens from Troy (fig. 2, &amp;, c, e) O. Fig. 2, d (from the grotto of Scaloria on a holding at Manfredonia) (10) is, on the other hand, sketched in with the simplicity of ab? stract design on yellow pottery of the kind referred to here under (2). It is frequently painted and is often found in the part of the Abruzzi near Teramo (Ripoli, etc.). I have suggested (") that this fragment, to? gether with the other, is characteristic of the treatment of the type of human face decora? tion. This would distinguish it from the nose type of decoration, of which a specimen is shown in fig. 2, h (from the Grotta dei Pipi strelli, now in the Museum of Matera). It is on rough pottery, made with the same kind of clay as the fragment fig 2 a (12). An intermediate type is that of the frag? ments fig 2, g and / (respectively from Sette ponti in the district of Matera and from Leporano in that of Taranto) (13). They are characterised by the fact that together with a sketch of a nose they show a rudimentary representation of eyes. In the Setteponti spe? cimen the eyes and the dotted lines are ob? tained by the technique used for stamped pottery, by engraving the design on the soft clay. On the other hand, the fragment from Leporano is one of compact pottery, polished and decorated with graffito, belonging to the class described under (1) and belongs ? as is suggested by the decoration which has been carried out under the edge ? to a bowl of average size. On this fragment the circum? ference of the orbit is more marked and links up with the specimens found at Troy. Thus the three types can be found on the four fundamental kinds of pottery of the Apulia-Materan Bronze Age, all belonging to groups which, as I have shown, were still being made in the late Bronze and the First Iron Age (14). The reliable data which I use to ascertain both the chronology and the cultural environ? ment are those of Middle Eastern area. The American excavations at Troy have cleared up many points and brought to light addi? tional details on the stratigraphy of Hissarlik. 19 ? Fig. 1. - Ceramics from the grotto St. Angelo: painted (b, c, e, f, i), ? graffiti ? {a, g, I). Lithic plates (d, h). Pottery decorated with anthropomorphic de? signs is found in Troy in all the strata from the 1st to the 5th. Summing up the information given by Bie? gen (15), the following kinds have been found in Troy: (I) A rudimentary sketch of eyes, lightly painted on the broad edge of a low bowl: a kind found in the Troy I and the Thermi le? vels (16). This kind of decoration (1T) is, ac? cording to Biegen, ? ancestor of the f?ces of Troy II ?. (II) Cylindrical face-lids ending in a point, with plastic representation of the hu? man face (as in fig 2, e, with in addition the upper end coming to a point) (18) This type is found in Troy II, it becomes common in Troy III, and continues in the 3rd and 4th city (Sch. Samm., 1053), others are found in the 3rd city, the one that was burnt down. (III) An anthropomorphic pot (gesichtva sen) (fig. 2, b) which ? has a long history in Troy ? and after rudimentary specimens it reappears at level g of the Und city (Troy II g) in grey, black polished pottery. It con? tinues all down the III, IV and V Trojan periods (19). 277</page><page sequence="3">Biegen was right in considering that ? the use of pots and face-lids continued for a long time, certainly from Troy II to Troy V ? (20). In Anatolia anthropomorphic decorations are found at Bolu (21) on two yellowish clay pots with a few traces of polish, one of which sketches a ? nose ? decoration (formed by a pinch of something placed between two straight lines engraved to mark the eyes), like speci? mens we have coming from Terlizzi and Mol fetta, while the other has a nose which is iden? tical to the fragments from the Cave of Bats and from Serra d'Alto. They both date back to the Early Metal Age. Other specimens are mentioned from the necropolis of Tekek?y on the Black Sea near Samsun, dating back to the Bronze Age (2400 2100 B.C.). At Alaca H?y?k vases of this description introduced in the Bronze Age dur? ing the whole of the Hittite age. They date back to 1600-1500 B.C. The specimen published from Bogazk?y (22) belongs to an age prior to 1500 B.C. and is identical to the fragment from Leporano (fig. 2 f) (23). Lamb (24) came to the conclusion that the face-urns originated in Anatolia and were in use for some 800 years. Fig. 2. - Anthropomorphic decorations on vases from Troy (b, c, e) and Apulia (a, d, f, h). 278 Of the Trojan types it may be said in sub? stance that, like those from Apulia-Materan, they are found on all the types of vases, from the grey to the polished and burnished types, to the red monochrome of the depas amphi kypellon; therefore this decorative motif shows no preference for any special kind of vase. As to their chronology, Biegen considers that the dates given to the periods, which cover, for convenience sake, the cultural ma? nifestations of the several cities, have only a hypothetical value (25). Therefore, if it is pos? sible to fix a definite date for the Trojan type (I), found only in Troy I (3000-2600 B.C.), the same cannot be said for the other kinds which are constantly found in Troy II, IV and V. We can only conjecture that the pe? riod corresponding to Troy III (2300-2200 B. C.) as the most favourable to their spread. That date may be considered acceptable for our a, d, which may be compared to the Trojan spe? cimens (b, c, e). But it is possible that the custom of anthropomorphic decorations conti? nued in Troy until and inclusive of the Vth city, that is to say until the end of 1900 B.C., bearing in mind that Troy V dates, according to Biegen, from 2050 to 1900 B.C. But in Anatolia, as I have already said, the evidence points to earlier dates, and so this type of decoration may go back to the 15th cent. B.C. Anthropomorphic decoration is not a spe? ciality of Anatolia, but is found in all the civi? lizations of the Middle East. In Asia Minor we are reminded by this fashion of the identical style that can be found in other artistic manifestations (26). The spe? cimens found in Luristan consist of a dagger (fig. 3 a) with the handle shaped somewhat a human face and of a statuette (fig. 3 6) (27) with a face roughly modelled in the style of the decorations mentioned. As is known, the date of the Luristan bronzes is a matter under dis? cussion as the answer depends above all on the results of typological and stylistic enqui? ries (28). Many of the specimens are distri? buted over a long period (29). A piece identical to the Molfetta-Troy one has been found in Mesopotamia (30); and gra? dually, as one proceeds westward, the style is found on rhyta shaped glasses in Palestine (31) and Cyprus (32), the specimens being identical to ours of Leporano (fig. 2, /). In Cyprus there are, in addition to these specimens of Trojan face-pots (33).</page><page sequence="4">a Fig. 3. - Anthropomorphic decorations from Luristan on the hilt of a dagger (a, from ancient Luristan, 2,300-2,100 B.C.) and on a statuette (b, of middle Luristan 1,900- 1,700 B.C.); and from Talyche on a metal vase (c, at recent Talyche 2, i.e. 1,450- 1,350 B.C.). A comparatively recent discovery shows that in Crete also the style of decoration of these vases was not unknown (34). In the delta stra? tum of the grotto mentioned Pendlebury found several face-lids (35) of the (II) Troyan type. They belong to an age of transition from the Neolithic to the Early Minoan I, which brings us down to 2900-2700 B.C., according to the chronology given by the Authors themselves (p. 24). They have rightly remarked that these fragments modelled with faces, which, though not identical, may be compared to those of Troy, are of a later date. It is, how? ever, clear that these deductions are valueless as we now have the results of the American excavations. All the same the observation made by the Authors to the effect that ? the shapes of the pots are perhaps too simple and obvious for parallels to be of any value ? should be borne in mind. Indeed, the iden? tity of the shapes of the face pots of Trapeza with the gesichtvasen of Troy neither proves that the two products were of the same period, nor that the one was derived from the others. Substantially, there are two specimens that are clearly connected with the Aegean and Middle Eastern style, i.e. fig. 2 a, d. Of the other Apulia-Materan fragments, it can be said that the one from Leporano (fig. 2, /) reminds one, as I have already said, of the piece with an identical decoration from Bo gazk?y (of an earlier date than 1500 B.C.), and that from Serra d'Alto (mentioned in a Not. Sea vi ?), of the anthropomorphic pot of Troy II-V, which also displays the trans? verse band (36) in relief, with transverse not? ches, representing some kind of a soldier's belt or the garment of a chief whose bones, cremated or reburied, were collected in the urn (37). For the Central-European and Danubian Balkanic area a further review of the icono graphic material leads one to believe that it is an anthropomorphic plan and not a plastic relief. What has been said by Schmidt him? self (38) still holds good, he considers that the specimen from Tordos can not be the proto? type of the Trojan ones. There is no lack of face-urns in the Helladic area which can be linked up to those of Troy. In the Argolis a rudimentary anthropomorphic jar has been found at Asine among objects coming from the Middle Helladic III (39); and an anthropomorphic decoration of a jar from Mycenae (Late Helladic III C) (40). Finally I note a clay fragment painted with a face from Vidra (Macedonia) (41), modelled like the similar fragment from the middle stratum of Vinga, which Childe rightly considers be? longs to the same ? circle of the idea of the anthropomorphic pottery ?. Others have been found in Rumania belonging to the Tripolye culture (42). The North Balkan group has the face-lids of Vinga (4S) similar but not identical to the Trojan specimens; identical to them is a little idol, also from Vinga (44), down to the speci? mens from Poznania (45) and Central Ger ). The point furthest north is found in Lithua? nia with statuettes with ocular decorations of the Anatolian type (47). As matters now stand, it would seem that in the Balkan area and in that of continental Europe, with the exception of the Poznian ter? ritory, the finished and accurate manner of treating the human face, which is found in specimens from Asia Minor and the Mediter? ranean countries, is rarely found owing to the dispersal of the original features which are replaced by a conventionalised style, or to a religious ideas, or to biological influence dur? ing the secondary polygenistic diffusion. In Europe and in the Western Mediterra? nean anthropomorphic decoration is connected either with little idols or with pots on which 279</page><page sequence="5">it is reduced to the accentuation of some par? ticulars, such for instance, as the breasts, which we find on Trojan pots. The pots de? corated with the seed-shaped eyes of Almeria (cfr. cit. at note 23) which can be connected with those here mentioned under type (I) of Troy, are found again in Scandinavia where they came from Spain over the Atlantic (48). They are found in Iberia at Los Miliares and along the Atlantic coast of Portugal (cfr. cit. at note 23). Little anthropomorphic idols in the far western Mediterranean are ascribed to the Bronze Age (2300-1700 B.C.), whose culture seems to be of Aegaean-Anatolian extraction. Some bowls found in Sardinia with anthropo? morphic markings are ascribed to the last ar? chaic Bronze age (49). In conclusion, as the illustration of the fea? tures common to the Mediterranean culture groups shows (figs. 6 and 7), anthropomor? phic decorations spread everywhere and in all ages (50). Anthropomorphic decorations are a feature which, in spite of their small intrinsic value, helps to show that East and West have at all times been in relation with one another, rela? tions which take on different aspects in the different centuries, being determined by the cultural features which had more or less im? portance as affected by prevailing religious ideas. The urn and the anthropomorphic de? corations of Troy, Apulia, Cyprus, Crete and perhaps of Malta also, did not disappear with the downfall of Troy VI. They are found again in the heaps at Halstatt and La Tene, and in the Rhineland until the age of Augus? tus (51), an age whose civilization presents very different characteristics. * ? * The other connecting link is the bossed-bone plaque (osso a globuli) of the tomb of the (c Sicilian ? or oven type of Altamura (Ba ri) C). It is the well-known kind of tomb of ellip? soidal shape, found all over the Mediterranean countries. It is characteristic of the funerary architecture of the Early and Middle Bronze Age, both Oriental and Occidental. It is found at Cyprus (53), Rhodes (54), Apulia (55), Si? cily O, Sardinia (57) Malta (58), and in the Iberian Peninsula (5*). The boned-bone (fig. 4, /) (60), so-called because it has in relief on its back six globules of the same size and is therefore identical with 280 the Trojan piece (61) (fig. 4 a), which must also have been engraved with some periglo bular ornament. The Trojan piece was found by Schliemann in the A temple, i.e. the great Megaron of stratum 2. The Altamura specimen is decorated with periglobular bands of transversal strokes. This pattern is often found on pottery scrat? ched with graffiti after firing, of the kind des? cribed here sub 1. The band with transversal strokes is found on pottery decorated in the ? Appennine ? style, described sub 3 (62). The decorative motifs are therefore those of the culture of Early and Middle Bronze Age where such pottery is that general found (63). As already stated, the material available for comparison with the bone-bossed of Altamura consist of three similar pieces found at Troy, of the bone-bossed of Lerna (Argos) of the fragment found at Malta and the nine pieces in East Sicily. The Troy specimens (fig. 4: a, b9 d) have been assigned, since the results of the Ame? rican excavations, to Troy II g, which is dated under Biegen's chronology, between 2400 and 2300 B.C. But many of the objects found in Troy II continued to be in use in the succes? sive cities, down to City V, that is to say until 1900 B.C. (64). A precise chronology cannot therefore be drawn up; this is also the case with the anthropomorphic decorations. If we accept the detailed stratigraphy of Troy these bones came into use at the time when the Ancient Bronze Age made way for the Middle period which, according to Biegen 's calcula? tions, corresponds to the Early and Middle Fig.. 4. - Globular bones from Troy (a, b, d), Malta (c), Lerna (e), Altamura (f).</page><page sequence="6">Helladic Age of the Greek mainland and to the Ancient and Middle Cycladic Age of the Islands. The bossed-bone of Lerna (65) came from the strata of transition from the Early to the Middle Helladic Age and according to the chronology of Wace and Biegen (66) it should be placed between 2000-1900 B.C., i.e. be? tween the Ancient Bronze 3 and the Middle Bronze 1 of Schaeffer. The fragment of ivory (fig. 4, d) from Malta comes from transition strata going from the Neolithic to the Bronze age (6T). Most of the Sicilian specimens come from Castelluccio (68), whose culture links up with that of the Cyclades and of the Middle Hel? ladic, therefore between 1900 and 1500-1400 B.C. As identical specimens are dated between the Ancient Bronze and the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, the similar specimens from Apulia may be given the same chrono? logy. This bone, however, is not only of chronological importance; it affords evidence which, when linked up with other data, re? lates the pre-classic civilization of Apulia with that of like date of other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. Another feature common to the civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean and of Asia Minor is that of the handles of the pottery painted in the so-called ? Matera ? style, often found also on monochrome pottery. I give here some fragments coming from different parts of the Apulian-Materan area. Of the fig. 5 a, b, d, g, h, the first four were brought by Rellini (69), the other was found in the Tremiti Islands (S. Domino) (70), hut its stylistic, chronological and cultural po? sition has not yet been adequately defined. I take this opportunity to publish also fig, 5 c, (from the Scaloria grotto) and e (from Coppa Nevigata, Manfredonia) (71). Here again, as can be seen, typological clas? sifications can be made based on the way in which the zoomorphic head is handled. The apex of the handle (fig. 5 /) has the form of a dog's head (72) and it certainly be? longed to a ritual vase, as did those coming from the necropolis of Vounos (73). We found in fig. 5 d a conventionalised bull's head handle which seems to recall the ?outline of the head of a ram. This handle is that of a vase painted brown in triangles, with toothed edges, and belongs to a bowl shaped vessel (perhaps ritual). s^*^^^ ** ^^^^^^^^^ L^HLSi^L^L^L^L^v /fit ?fc^^^? ?i^L^LSBsil?^^. Fig. 5. - Handles of the Bronze Apulia-Materan ceramics with zoomorphic protomes (d, c, f), and volutes (b, e, g, h). The Apulia-Materan painted pottery has zoomorphic handles evidently patterned on rams heads. It would however be risky to claim that these handles are derived from the many spe? cimens that can be found in the pottery of the Aegean-Anatolian civilizations. Undoub? tedly the inspiration which sought to give a zoomorphic shape to a handle is found in all the East-Mediterranean cultures. In addition, indeed, to the comparisons drawn between the ancient objects from Mycenae and the Trojan material of Schliemann (already recalled in the works of Gervasio) I will here refer to the observations made on this matter by Ble gen C). As I have already said, these handles are characteristic of vases used for ritual purposes and they are widely distributed over the geo cultural area. They are found in Troy VI (1900-1275 B.C.) and Biegen refers to the geo cultural area of Mycenae, pointing to the re? semblances between the animal heads of the Trojan handles and those found on the ear? thenware toys of Mycenae and Prosymna. Similar specimens are also found in the Hit tite-Anatolian area (75). Another type of handle is also found on the ? buccheroide ? pottery.

We find this kind of handle on the a appenninic ? ware of Terlizzi, Bari, Coppa Nevigata, Scoglio del Tonno and Porto Pe rone (76). The analogous specimens which I have examined in the 'earth-sea' material of the ? Pigorini ? Museum, together with the Apulian specimens, stand numerous compari? sons with the vascular material of Troy (7T). The discussions on handles also contribute to show the inconsistency of theories which would base the origin of a culture on decora? tive motifs or on the shapes of vases. The historical-cultural importance of these handles lies in the fact that, taken together with the other features that have been described, they show that South Italy, and more especially the region Apulia-Mater an, belong, as shown by these features which are common to the great Middle Eastern and Mediterranean civiliza? tions, to the vast cultural unity of the Medi? terranean Bronze Age.

(29) See Bussagli, op. cit., No. 134 (between the XIV and IX centuries B.C.); again the statuette, No. 169, does not seem to date further back than the 9th cent. B.C., although the inscription comes down to 5 or 6 hundred years B.C. I shall speak further on of the importance of this duration in the Middle East area also; it has always been held to have originated there, although its culture offers the same problems as those found in all cultural areas. The like treatment of the human face is found in</page><page sequence="10">mural decorative pannels (see Bussagli, op. cit., No. 190) of the 11th cent. B.C. Again in the Bronze Age civiliza? tion of Talyche we have the example (fig. 3, c) (from Schaeffer, Stratigraphie, fig. 225: 8), that Schaeffer himself dates back to the late Talyche 2, i.e. 1450-1350 B.C., (syn? chronising with the recent Ugaritic 2, the Late Minoan 2 etc., I refer the reader back to the synoptic table) which is the same as our fig 2, d, from which it differs only in that it is made of bronze.

(37) The other fragment from Serra d'Alto (national Mu? seum of Matera) shows, beside the nose a tremulous graffito decoration probably meant to represent a human figure de? signed in the manner of Podbaba-Prague and of Novaves (both in Bohemia) and in the style of Biikk. The Laviosa (in he piii antiche cuture agricole europee, Milan, 1943, Table XXX: 2, 5; XXXI: 17, 12) expresses the opinion that this style of decoration is spread over other Germanic areas with lineal pottery, as at Niedervellmar near Cassel.

(4T) Gimbutas M., The prehistory of Eastern Europe, part I, Cambridge (Mass) 1956, fig. Ill: a, b, c; plates 44. This is a good monograph on the prehistory of East Europe which can save us from the need of consulting bibliogra? phies in North-Eastern languages which are often inaccessible (see my review in ? Riv. di Antropologia ?, Vol. XLV, 1958). (48) Cfr. Dechelette, Manuel, I, p. 599. (49) See first of all the material in the archaeological Museum of Madrid; among which that from Almeria, there are arrow-heads with winglets on a triangular base, often bent (which were widely used in the Early Helladic, as for instance, at Asine cit., fig. 175, Early Helladic III), fired pottery decorated with graffiti on a burnished surface (like the Apulia-Materan pottery described here sub 1) and with the famous bell-beaker, stone and bronze daggers shaped like a laurel leaf, etc. In the Almerian culture, and generally speaking in the so-called Iberian bronze-age cultures I have noted many features identical with those of the Premycenaean Apulia-Materan culture. The most evident feature is the pottery decorated, after firing, with graffiti in geometrical patterns (of the type sub 1). Else? where I purpose to set forth clearly their interdependence. This is one of the features which is lacking, for intance in the Castelluccio culture of Sicily. We do not, as far as I remember, find among its vascular products the burnished fired pottery with graffiti of the Matera-Ostuni type, and perhaps of the Chassey-Cortaillod. The connections existing between the pottery of those two areas should be thoroughly examined before faking positive assertions about the oriental origin of this class of vascular pottery, so widely spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin. (Cfr. Bailloud et Mieg de Boofzheim, Les civilisations, cit. for the Eastern origin); but before expressing an opinion on the relations between East and West all the cultural features common to the Bronze Age civilisations of the two areas should be studied. On the relations between the civilisation of the first Iberian Bronze Age with the East, consult finally Almagro M., Ori gen y formation del pueblo hispano. Barcelona, 1958. For Sardinia cfr. Lilliu G., Ciottolo inciso prenuragico, in ? Ar cheologia classica ?, Vol. X, 1958, p. 183 et seq. (50) I recall that this form of decoration continued not only in Luristan (cfr. Notes 28 and 29), but also in Rhodes (? cfr. ? Clara Rhodos ?, III, 1939, fig. 94, inochae with a plastic face on the neck, of the 8th cent. B.C.), at Ilia Plana-Eivissa in the Phoenician-Carthaginian period, Bosch Gimpera wished these to be compared to the Syrian and Cyprian (see Id., Ethnologia cit., fig. 218 and p. 266 note 2; in the case of the former those of Karkhemish preceding that last Hittite period of that city, i.e. 1200 900 B.C.; for the latter those from Cyprus which come down to the 7th cent. B.C.. The fourth at the bottom to the right of fig. 212 from Ilia Plana is identical to the short conical lids found at Troy, and is of the 7th cent. B.C. The figurines from Ilia Plana are related to the earthenware of Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus of the 10-8th centuries which may be dated at Eivissa to the 8th-7th centuries B.C.). The treatment of the nose by ? pinching ? the clay and of the eyes by accentuating the arch of the eyebrows, is also found in the Carthaginian pottery of the Roman period (Bosch Gimpera, Ethnologia, cit., pp. 309 and 255). Mention should also be made of the very complete studies on the little Nuraghe bronzes (Lilliu G., Sculture della Sardegna nuragica, Cagliari, 1956). I cannot here go into the whole matter of the relations between this usage con? nected with the ancient Eurasian agricultural civilisation and the similar Peruvian post-Christian ones, on which the decorations are carried out in plastics and paint and the vases are for funerary purposes (cfr. Tentori T., Collezione Nathan Commings oVarte antica del Peril, Rome, 1956, ed. De Luca). Many examples are kept in the American col? lection of the Museum at Madrid.
