<plain_text><page sequence="1">?O???? IN THE DELIAN INVENTORY LISTS1) In an important recent study Clarisse Pr?tre reviewed a number of suffixes that appear in the vocabulary of the Delian inventory lists.2) The votives in question have been interpreted in the past as imitations of larger objects and/or miniatures, but upon closer examination it becomes clear that their nomenclature is often ambiguous and does not necessarily refer to size and presumed stricdy votive use. Moreover, in a number of cases the term for the object is interchangeable with its diminutive form.3) Suffix -??? is the most common of these, and Pr?tre convincingly divides all terms with that ending into four groups, each corresponding to a specific meaning. Among these Group B, the so-called 'Suffix of Resemblance' (according to Pr?tre) comprises objects that resemble others although they are not their equivalent; -??? is thus added to the root of the names of animals or living beings (human and divine) in order to signify statues and jewellery.4) Pr?tre next furnishes a number of examples: she translates ???d??? as 'a figurine in the likeness of an animal', a ????ef????? as 'a piece of jewellery in the form of a bull's head', and ??d????t??? as 'a statue representing a human' (all my translations after Pr?tre).5) Pr?tre's theory appears to be correct in most counts except in the case of the term ???d???: its suffix is -?d???, rather than -???. ????? itself is derived with the suffix -??? from the theme ??-, which is why the diminu- tive ???d??? is used instead. Additionally, the term ???d??? has a more general meaning than the one ascribed to, and it refers primarily, though probably not exclusively, to statuettes of human figures. This is evident in the case of several votives that are mentioned in the Delian inventories, of which one will be presented in some detail: some time before 279 BC ?

'??te??? ?p? ??se?? ??????? ?stata a???e?a ??e??]??? The two figurines are described as ???d?a throughout the third century BC, and for the next fifty years another diminutive, ??d????t?a is used instead. It is therefore plausible to conclude that the two words were inter- changeable, and the text leaves us in no doubt as to their reference to anthropomorphic images, in this case to Apollo and Artemis. The diminu- tive forms probably also signify small size, as is the case with a similar dedication around the same time by an otherwise unidentified Apollodoros, which was kept at the Temple of Apollo. His dedication is described as ???d?a d?? ?p' ??????????, and we know that semi-circular exedrae were in vogue as bases for group monuments in Greek sanctuaries.6) Like Kleino, it is possible that Apollodoros also dedicated figurines, perhaps of Apollo and Artemis, of a relatively small size as they weighed 42 drachms, or about 180 modern grams, in all. It is also worth noting that Apollodoros' dedication is referred to elsewhere as ???d???a, the diminutive -a???? also functioning as suffix denoting resemblance.7) The term ???a as reference to human figures is attested in the late fifth century BC. Inscribed building accounts of the Erechtheion refer to the relief decoration of its frieze (???f????) as ??e?s???a??? ????? p??? h?i t? ???a.8) Indeed, the temple was built in Pentelic marble with bluish Eleusinian limestone for the frieze, to which, as the relevant building account also informs us, figures?mainly female?in white marble were attached by clamps.9) Animal figurines are also included in the Delian inventory lists, but they are not necessarily described in diminutive terms; we may therefore deduce the size of these votives when we take into account their reported weight. We hear thus of an ?et?? a??????? ep????s?? which weighed 40 drachms (ca. 173 modern grs.) that was kept at the Artemision alongside an ?pp????? ?p????s??.10) Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Oude Geschiedenis E.
