The Wolves of Heaven: Cheyenne Shamanismt, Cere- monies, and Prehistoric Origins. KARL H. SCHLE- SIER, with drawings by WAH-PAH-NAH-YAH (DICK WEST). University of Oklahoma Press, Nor- man, 1987. xviii + 214 pp., illustrations, biblio., index. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Jeffrey R. Hanson, University of Texas- Arlington. In Wolves of Heaven, Karl Schlesier reconstructs the prehistoric origins of the Tsistsista branch of the Chey- enne and places their genesis as a tribal entity in the Northern Plains. Drawing on an eclectic assortment of perspectives and methodologies including cognitive- linguistic, ethnological, and archaeological approaches, Schlesier sets about his task, which is to place Cheyenne antiquity in the Northern Plains beginning about 500- 300 B.C. Focusing on Tsistsista "world description" and the cultural centrality of the Tsistsista Massaum or earth-renewal ceremony, Schlesier's aim is to pro- vide a "reinterpretation of Tsistsistas culture accept- able to the Tsistsistas" (p. xii). The author warns the reader in advance that his interpretation of Tsistsistas culture history "contradicts all the extant literature on the Cheyenne" (p. xi). In the first chapter, Schlesier provides an emic view of Tsistsistas world description and shamanism. Heavily drawing on Tsistsistas cosmologic and cos- mographic classifications, Schlesier uses a cognitive- linguistic perspective to describe Tsistsistas shaman- ism and theories of hunting. In chapters two and three, Schlesier describes the world description of Northern Siberian societies and draws parallels between them and North American Algonkian hunters. For example, parallels are drawn between the role of Siberian shamans in petitioning spirit "game keepers" for animal renewal and the Tsist- sistas Massaum. Based upon comparisons such as these, Schlesier argues for a homologous relationship between Algonkian-speaking peoples (including the Cheyenne) and northern Siberian hunters. Chronologically, proto- Tsistsistas, as a vanguard of southward Algonkian mi- grations from a Taiga Biome, immigrated around 1000 B.C., arriving in the Plains 500 years later (p. 43). The following chapter is devoted to a description of Tsistsistas medicine hunts, spirit-lodge rituals, sweat- lodge ceremonies, and the "contrary" institution. These data are used as evidence for a Tsistsistas entrance into the Northern Plains prior to that of other known Plains tribes. Chapters five and six describe the role of the Mas- saum ceremony in Tsistsistas history and prehistory and its validation of the Black Hills as the Cheyenne's first permanent homeland on the Plains. This chapter is particularly rich in details of this important Chey- enne ceremony. It is through the Massaum camp, with its spatial, cosmological, and astronomical orientations that Schlesier traces ancient Tsistsistas territory, as evi- denced by the Bighorn and the Moose Mountain med- icine wheels (p. 87). Chapter seven, Early Tsistsistas in the Northern Plains, bears the most relevance for archaeologists. Here Schlesier attempts to correlate known linguistic groups with prehistoric archaeological complexes and phases: Aztec-Tanoan (Kiowa) with Pelican Lake; Athabaskan with Avonlea; non-Tsistsistas Algonkians (Suhtai, Arapaho, Atsina) with Laurel; Caddoan with "Valley phase"; and Tsistsistas with Besant (pp. 111-135). It is the association of Besant with Tsistsistas that is crit- ical to Schlesier's assertion that this group was "cre- ated" in North Dakota around 500 B.C. In his final two chapters, Schlesier sets the general features of Algonkian shamanistic world interpretation in the context of prehistoric climate change and tribal migration. Comparing Tsistsistas shamanistic inter- pretation with those of distant Algonkians like the Yu- rok and Mahican, and contrasting the Massaum with the Mandan Okipa ceremony, Schlesier concludes that the Massaum owes more to a homologous Algonkian heritage than to Siouan diffusion. Finally, Schlesier ar- gues not only for the evolutionary success of Algon- kian-Siberian world description, but for the opposition of scientific rationalism and shamanistic world views and the objective superiority of the latter. While sha- manistic world view "allows recognition of the other," rationalist world view is anthropomorphic, mechanis- tic, and ethnocentric (p. 189). Wolves of Heaven is unquestionably a thought-pro- voking book. Its contribution, however, seems to lie not in the archaeological or ethnohistoric implications of Schlesier's interpretations, but rather in the philo- sophical and epistemological problems associated with writing history that will "be acceptable" to particular ethnic or interest groups. Schlesier's disdain for sci- entific rationalism appears evident in his uncritical and often superficial use of archaeological data and eth- nologic method. From a scientific rationalist perspec- tive, Schlesier's book exhibits numerous flaws. His eth- nographic "evidence" is highly selective and bears little or no control. His use of archaeological data lacks both depth and detail and his diffusionary conclusions lack both distributional and chronological controls. His failure to include ethnohistoric and archaeological ma- terials documenting a Cheyenne horticultural episode is a mystery. Archaeologists and ethnohistorians in- terested in a scientific-rationalist contribution to Chey- enne culture history may be disappointed. However, those interested in the philosophy and epistemology of extreme ethnohistoric relativism will find Wolves of Heaven thought provoking.
