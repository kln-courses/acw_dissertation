<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INVERTEBRATE PANORAMA, by J. E. Smith, J. D. Carthy, Garth Chapman, R. B. Clark, and David Nichols. 1971. Universe Books, New York. 416 p. $12.50. In this eighth volume in the "Uni- verse Natural History" series, five prominent British invertebrate zoo- logists attempt a fresh look at inver- tebrate forms (mostly marine, and not including protozoa and insects) and some of their ways of life. Smith treats of the history of the field and the "personae"-an inventory of inverte- brate groups; Carthy, nervous systems, behavior, and animal associations; Chapman, movement and locomotion; Clark, structure, places of occurrence, feeding, reproduction, and development; and Nichols, paleontology and phylo- geny. The book, which the jacket blurb calls "an invaluable work of reference," includes some excellent dis- cussions and illustrations suitable for expanding one's lectures or for assigned readings in a general-biology or zoology course or in elementary invertebrate zoology. The book is pleasing in ap- pearance, well printed, and well bound. Unfortunately, much of it seems hastily written-words poorly chosen, grammar bruised, and ideas uncertainly ex- pressed; some of the discussions are poor and include inaccuracies; and the figures often are badly drawn or in- adequately explained. The introduction and the opening chapters are par- ticularly weak: almost certainly they will confuse any but advanced students (for whom the book is not appropriate). For example, the names Bryozoa, Poly- zoa (these two in the same table), and Ectoprocta are used essentially inter- changeably but in contexts that do not make obvious the fact that they stand for a single group. Anthropomorphism (for example, echinoderrns are "op- portunist and conventional") invites loose thinking from the reader. Choice of words jumps from oversimplified to arch. Much of what is wrong with the book can be seen in the two pages of photo- graphs of Precambrian fossils at the middle of the book-photos illuminating the text (p. 348-50) near the end. Nichols discusses, exceedingly briefly but rather well, the roughly 1,500 in- dividual Australian fossils that are our earliest known remnants of multi- cellular animals-highly interesting and r - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - m m * A 25?% ncentive to convince you that our lab manual will show you how to implement a safe, * 'shands-on nuclear science . :lab program._ * Spend just $3.00.

The illustrations are awkwardly distant from the text; the printing is not as clear as it should be; and the captions, comparing the fossils with edrioasteroids, pennatulids, Spinther, and Tomopteris, are not likely to be helpful to student readers. Only the edrioasteroids are listed in the in- dex. Here, and again and again else- where, the book fails to satisfy the sort of reader who would be likely to refer to it. With tight book budgets, this book is not a must. J. L. Mohr University of Southern California Los Angeles</page></plain_text>
