<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Ivory Figurines from Egypt' PETER J. UCKO THE AIM OF THIS PAPER is to document as fully as possible a most important group of ivory figurines2 which have long been referred to in the literature but which have never received adequate description or illustration. Many of these fifty figurines have now been traced for the first time since about I925, and all but four (perhaps even three) of these figurines can see the light of day again, for the first time together with full descriptions and photographs.3 The importance of this group of figurines is reflected in the fact that they have been referred to (singly or in groups) for the purposes of supporting a Mother Goddess interpretation (e.g. Hornblower 1929, P. 37), for assessing foreign connexions between Egypt and Palestine (e.g. Perrot I959, PP. i6-i8), and for illustrating Predynastic Egyptian work in ivory (e.g. Ranke I948, P1. 3) . HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION The arrival of these figurines in England ( (a) British Museum; (b) Petrie Collection; (c) MacGregor Collection) divides them into three main assemblages. (a) The six figurines in the British Museum were first published by Budge (1902, PP. 52-3; and I909, P. 26, figs. 8-io), having been bought by him in I899 without knowledge of their provenances. (b) Seven figurines in the Petrie Collection, London, were obtained by Petrie sometime before I905 as 'a group which was bought together from a local country dealer, as having been found at Ballas' (Petrie 1920, p. 6). (c) The largest number, thirty-two, were originally in the MacGregor Collection, London, and must have been bought by I900, for some of them were published by Naville in that year (Naville I900, p. 96; Pls. IV, V). In this work Naville gives their provenance as found by natives at Naqada, from an unknown number of tombs, and he states that both the MacGregor Collection and British Museum figurines probably came from the cemetery of Naqada. This view is based on the similarities between the figurines of the groups in the British Museum and the MacGregor Collection. The provenance of the MacGregor Collection group of figurines has been compli- cated by the sale catalogue of that collection (Sotheby Sale Catalogue 1922, P. 93) where all this material is stated to have been found at Saonyah. It is possible that this information was derived from MacGregor records but there is no way to substantiate this. After this sale many of these figurines were dispersed to museums throughout the world (see Catalogue below) and one group of these figurines is said to have been found at Semainyah (e.g. Steindorff 1946, p. I9) on the assumption that the Sotheby Sale Catalogue information was a distortion. There is no positive evidence to support this assumption. 21 4</page><page sequence="2">ANTHROPOMORPHIC IVORY FIGURINES FROM EGYPT 2I5 During the search for these figurines it became clear that these three main assem- blages of figurines did not exhaust the number of similar ivory figurines. One figurine was bought by Schiaparelli in I90o-I from illegal excavations at Luxor; another (originally in the Hilton Price Collection) was bought some time before I9II, and is said to have come from Diospolis (Sotheby Sale Catalogue I9II, Lot I372); one figurine was bought in Cairo in I926; and two figurines were bought by Petrie some time before I 920. In view of the extremely small number of ivory figurines found during excavations of Predynastic Egyptian sites (see Ucko I965), these bought ivory figurines assume a great importance. CATALOGUE AND DESCRIPTION Although since I900 several of these figurines have been frequently referred to in publications, none have received full descriptions or illustrations. Only front-view photographs of some of them have been published (the fullest documentation is the Sotheby Sale Catalogue!) while the descriptions which do exist are concerned with only certain features shown on them. The catalogue (appendix at the end of this article) includes all the figurines belonging to this group and has been drawn up according to a system developed for the presenta- tion of other anthropomorphic figurines from Egypt and elsewhere (see Ucko I965). Each figurine has been given a number from I-46 and is accompanied by similarly numbered half-size photographs4 of front, back, and side views (Pls. i-4). In the first column of the Catalogue is given the present whereabouts of the figurines together with the date, where known, of their appearance on the market. Subsequent columns of the catalogue are drawn up on the following basis: A. Material: measurements in inches in the following order; maximum height; maximum width of shoulders; width of waist (narrowest point of the mid-body region); width of hips (widest point of the lower part of the body), excluding arms; maximum thickness of the upper part of the body; maximum thickness of the lower part of the body, including protrusion of buttocks and legs, but excluding penis or sheath when present. B. Arm positions and techniques for showing arms. C. Position and shape of head. Details and description of facial features and hair. D. Description of breasts or penis or sheath. E. Posture. Position of legs and techniques for showing legs. F. Description of buttocks and techniques for showing buttocks. G. Description of clothing and techniques used. H. Description of anatomical details and techniques used. Following each catalogue entry are given the most important published references to individual figurines. TYPOLOGY AND ANALYSES Detailed analysis (Table i) shows that it is impossible to isolate exclusive 'types' of figurines within this group of bought ivory figurines. It is possible to find exclusive starting-points, for example the absence or presence of pegs, which successfully divide</page><page sequence="3">216 PETERJ.UCKO these figurines into several groups but once this starting point is passed other charac- teristics are shown indiscriminately on figurines from any of the groups isolated. The figurines can be sub-divided into those with hair indicated as opposed to those represented bald with projecting ears. They can be sub-divided into those with breasts as opposed to those with penis or sheath. They can be sub-divided into those modelled on pegs as opposed to those without pegs. The pegs on which some figurines are modelled vary considerably in shape and size. Many of those on rectangular or oval pegs cannot, in fact, stand freely on these bases. One exceptional figurine (No. 36) has a rectangular base with small round peg below it. Several of the figurines with no pegs can be certainly said never to have been modelled on any sort of base for details under the feet are indicated. Both the figurines with and without hair indicated can be further sub-divided into nude and clothed representations. The bald figurines can be further sub-divided into 'dwarfs' with bandy legs and ledge buttocks, and non-deformed representations. However this latter sub-division of bald figurines crosses the other suggested division, for the dwarfs include both males and females and are found variously modelled on pegs or free-standing. Figurines with hair: All figurines with hair (except one, see below) have hair on top of the head, down the side of the face and hanging in braids onto the chest. Most of these braids are modelled in relief and many have horizontal or vertical incisions across them; some are plain, a few have traces of paint on them (e.g. Nos. 25, 41) and one (No. 26) is not modelled but painted blue. All have rectangular or sub-rectangular wedges of hair hanging down the back of the neck. Some of these are plain, some painted in black or blue, but most are filled with cross-hatching or with vertical and/or horizontal incisions. The figurines with hair in braids on the front and rectangle on the back are always shown with eyes, nose, and mouth, and occasionally with pupils but never with ears. Those with modelled eyes have no eyebrows. One unique figurine (No. 6) has hair modelled in a bun and has ears represented as well. Baldfigurines: Figurines with no hair have eyes and ears represented but not always the nose or mouth. One bald figurine (No. 24) only retains one ear and can be seen to have had the ears inserted into a round hole. Most of the figurines with inlaid or filled eyes are bald. Male figurines: Figurines with penis or sheath never have navels indicated and it is indeed remarkable that, however simple or complex the representation, the sheaths start in the navel region and continue down to the top of the leg separation. The cut-outs and incisions on figurine No. I0 were interpreted by Petrie (1920, p. 7) as the under- cutting during the manufacture of a sheath. It is difficult to imagine any other possible interpretation. Femalefigurines: Figurines with breasts are sometimes shown with navels. Two figurines (Nos. 2I, 27) appear to have two 'navels' represented, one above the other. The two holes on each figurine are of about the same diameter and depth as each other and as the pubic punctures, and must be assumed to have been misplaced. Navels are indicated either high (e.g. No. 2) or centrally (e.g. Nos. 4, 31) on the abdomen and occasionally are placed on a rounded modelled protrusion (e.g. No. 24).</page><page sequence="4">ANTHROPOMORPHIC IVORY FIGURINES FROM EGYPT 217 Dwarffigurines: Figurines with bandy legs are rarely modelled on pegs. They all (except possibly No. I8) have buttocks modelled as ledges which may be divided by incision, separately modelled, or undifferentiated; one dwarf is shown with lumbar dimples. No dwarf is shown with hands or fingers, ankles or toes but all (except one, see below) have stump arms or modelled arms projecting downwards, sometimes joined to the hips. All the dwarfs are shown with modelled or turned-up feet and all have shoulders modelled from about chin level. One unique example carries a baby in outstretched arms (No. 20). Nude figurines: All figurines without clothing are shown with separately modelled legs, or legs divided by incision. All these figurines, except one, have the buttocks indicated by simple incision, by incisions with horizontal line below, by modelling, by horizontal line alone, by undifferentiated horizontal ledge, or by horizontal ledge with division. The one exceptional figurine has the incised leg division carried high up to the buttock region and is a crudely made example (No. I 7). Clothed figurines: Among this group of ivory figurines are five with neither buttock nor leg division. Two of these figurines (Nos. 6, 46) are obviously clothed for on one the fringe of the dress is clearly shown and on the other the bottom of the legs and feet protrude from beneath the dress. The other three figurines (Nos. 25, 37, 40) could well be clothed also for they are shown with no body details, and this interpretation is confirmed by their undifferentiated legs and buttocks. Other features of the figurines cross the boundaries of these various groupings although some consistencies can be isolated. Figurines with arms crossed over the abdomen (e.g. No. i) are all shown with eyes, nose and mouth. All except one, which has inlaid eyes, have also the pupils marked. All are modelled on pegs, have modelled and incised feet, toes, hands and fingers (and occasionally thumbs). All are shown without necks and with the arms modelled from a level well above the chin. Figurines with arms elongated and curved down the side of the body are all bald with ears and inlaid eyes represented. Many, but not all, have eyebrows also indicated. All except one of these figurines with legs intact are shown with ankle projections, and only one male example is modelled on a peg. These figurines are rarely shown with hands and fingers modelled, but often with feet and toes modelled and incised, and always without a neck and with the arms starting from the level of the chin or above. Figurines with ankles and toes represented may or may not be modelled on pegs and may or may not be shown with modelled and incised hands and fingers but if they have ankles they also have bent or rounded knees. One figurine (No. 42) is unique in hav-ing incised lines on the front of the legs, representing the knees. All figurines with hands, on the contrary, also have feet and toes represented. Hands and fingers seem to be represented predominantly on figurines with arms crossed over the abdomen or somehow in contact with the breasts, but rarely on figurines with arms either elongated and curved or straight down the sides of the body (including arm stumps). One figurine (No. 26) has the fingers of the right hand indicated but neither the hand nor fingers of the left arm shown. Another figurine (No. 30) has the fingers and thumb of the right hand modelled and incised but only the thumb of the left hand. Figurines with one arm in contact with the breast, as well as figurines with arms</page><page sequence="5">2I8 PETERJ. UCKO down the side of the body, are occasionally shown with neck and often with arms starting from about chin level. Nipples are rarely shown on female figurines. Those that have nipples also have navels and toes and feet and usually fingers and hands, but may or may not have hair represented. They are shown with any position of the arms. The pubic region on female figurines is indicated either by cut-out or incision, punctured triangle or punctured fan. On some figurines (e.g. No. 4I) the pubic region may have been painted (blue). There is no association between these various types of pubic representation and any other feature of the figurines, except their sex (i.e. breasts). Not all female figurines with breasts have the pubic area indicated, so figurine No. 36 is classed as female in the typology (Table I) and catalogue, below, on the basis of the absence of penis or sheath. However its breasts are shallower than on any other figurine and it was probably intended to represent a male. Forty-two figurines retain the eye(s) which are variously modelled, incised in detail, incised as a simple line, or filled. Twenty-two figurines have eyebrows and thirteen have pupils indicated. There is no correlation between the presence of eyebrows and any one method of incision or modelling the eyes, but all those with eyebrows have also pupils or filled eyes (unless No. 8 was an exception to this rule, see catalogue below). It is likely that figures (such as Nos. 30, 4I) with eye hollows only were originally painted in some detail for traces of black or blue paint can still be made out on some of these figurines. On one figurine (No. 33) it can be seen that the bored eye-holes intercommunicate. Forty figurines have noses represented, varying from a rectangular to a pear shape, modelled, cut-out, or incised. One figurine only (No. 28) has nostrils. Thirty-one figurines have mouths and lips represented, varying from a simple incised slit, to a cut-out wedge, to a fully modelled mouth. One exceptional figurine (No. 26) is shown with the mouth detail of the philtrum. There is no evident relationship between any particular method of representing facial features and other features of the figurines. There is no positive correlation between the representation of the eyes or eyebrows and the representation of the nose and mouth. Two exceptional figurines (Nos. 29, 35) with few shared characteristics are both damaged but were probably shown with deformity of the chest and back. One excep- tional dwarf figurine (No. 2o) has been already noted on account of the baby which she carries in outstretched arms but there is also one exceptional non-deformed figurine (No. 6) with a baby on her back held in her left arm. This same figurine is unique in its modelled hair bun and modelled ears, as well as its modelled dress with fringe, covering the whole body except one large pendulous breast. Figurine No. 8 is exceptional in its crude workmanship, rectangular cut-out breasts, rectangular cut-out arms and flatness (and thus somewhat resembles some figurines usually assigned a Middle Kingdom date). One final figurine (No. 36) stands out from all the others in the elaborate modelling of the muscles of the legs, calves, and arms, and in the rounded backward protrusion of the head. CONCLUSION This group of forty-six standing ivory figurines reflects two major intentions. The first, one of function, as seen by the difference between figurines without and with pegs. The</page><page sequence="6">ANTHROPOMORPHIC IVORY FIGURINES FROM EGYPT 2I9 second, one of presentation, as seen by the difference between figurines with and without hair but with ears. It must be recognized, however, that these two interests do not coincide, for figurines with or without pegs may or may not have hair or ears. It is a striking fact of the above analysis (see Table I) that whatever criterion is chosen as the starting point for investigation (e.g. peg, hair, bandy-leg, dress, sex, etc.), further analysis reveals that figurines of each group share other features regardless of the original groupings. It is therefore possible to say that this group of figurines includes, for example, dwarfs, figurines on pegs, figurines with arms elongated and curved down the side of the body. Yet it is almost impossible to isolate other features shared exclusively by figurines of any one of these groups which are not also found on figurines of another group. The freedom of expression revealed by this analysis contrasts strongly with the extreme similarity of a few individual figurines (e.g. Nos. 2, 24 and 3I with arms elongated and curved down the side of the body; Nos. I, 7 and 44 with arms crossed over the abdomen and hands projecting downwards). DATE Published estimates: In the literature these figurines are referred to either as Predynastic or Archaic in date. However, there is little agreement as to the choice of predynastic period. On analogy with an excavated figurine from Mahasna (see below) both Petrie (I920, p. 6) and Perrot (I959, p. i6) have assigned several of these figurines to the Amratian period. For no specified reasons Petrie assigned another figure to the Proto- dynastic period, 'Sequence Date 75 ?' (figurine No. 9) while Perrot allowed that certain of the figurines (Nos. I, 3, 4) might be Dynastic. Hornblower (I929, p. 37) dated the figurines to the Middle Predynastic or later while Steindorif and Stevenson Smith have accepted the provenance of the figurines as Semaineh and therefore their date as Semainean. Others have favoured a Protodynastic date (e.g. Galassi I955) or have called them Archaic (e.g. Sotheby Sale Catalogue I922; Naville I900, p. 66; Budge I909, p. 26 [cir. 4200 B.C.]). Individual figurines have been isolated from the rest and have been assigned Archaic dates (Budge I909, p. 53 (No. 6); Contenau I 9 I 4, p. 7 I (No. 4) ) . Dating problems: All the figurines considered in this article were bought at some time or other, and their provenances and dates are uncertain. Either all these figurines can be treated together as a group whose date may be predynastic or later, or they can be treated individually so that some may be predynastic and others later. In publications most of the figurines have been treated together in various groups with only one or two individual figurines isolated from the groups. In the literature the question of a late dating of some or all of these figurines has been confined to their attribution to the Early Dynastic or Archaic period but, theoretically at least, it is possible that some or all date from later Dynastic periods or even from modern times.5 As so often with bought material the only conclusive way of dating it is by scientific tests. Without these, attributions can only be based on stylistic analogies with datable material and the subjective judgement of the examiner. Predynastic: One of the difficulties in assessing parallels between these bought ivory figurines and predynastic material is the paucity of excavated ivory figurines and the</page><page sequence="7">220 PETERJ. UCKO fact that the few excavated examples known differ considerably in many of their characteristics from the majority of other excavated predynastic figurines which are of clay and vegetable paste (see Ucko I965). It is for this reason that these bought ivory figurines have been so frequently grouped together with the few excavated predynastic ivory figurines for purposes of inter-country comparisons. In fact discussion of foreign connexions prior to 3,000 B.C. on the basis of Egyptian and Beersheba figurines, for example, must be based on excavated predynastic Egyptian material until the date of these bought ivory figurines is firmly established (see Ucko I 965) . The pegs on which many of these bought figurines are modelled have no convincing parallels among predynastic material. It is true that two ivory figurines in the Berlin Museum (Scharff I929, P1. i6, 78 and 79; Ucko I965, Nos. I50 and I5I) stand on rectangular pegs but these figurines were bought and their usual ascription to be predynastic period cannot be accepted (see below). Only 'tag' figurines are modelled on pegs (e.g. the ivory figurines from Matmar (Brunton I948, P1. i 6, i 9)), but these are as flat as the figurines themselves, and were not intended to act as bases on which the figurines should stand, for the figurines in fact were found in tombs tied together round the hips. Excavated ivory and clay/vegetable paste figurines are modelled free-standing, or as a wedge tapering to rounded or pointed end and it is notable that these bought ivory figurines include no example resembling the latter. Excavated figurines, including 'tags' and 'pins', made of relatively hard materials such as ivory are characteristically shown with projecting ears, unlike excavated figurines of softer materials such as clay. Sixty-three per cent of the bought ivory figurines which are the subject of this article are also shown with projecting ears but thirty-six per cent of these figurines are shown with hair but no ears. Also characteristic of the 'pin' and 'tag' excavated figurines made from hard materials are their pointed chins modelled or cut-out low over the chest, while these bought ivory figurines have clearly modelled chins which are never triangular in shape. The excavated 'tag' and 'pin' figurines characteristically have cut-out noses placed high between the eyes and with rectangular cut shoulders without arms; neither of these features are found on these bought ivories. On the other hand excavated ivory figurines also have arms elongated down the side of the body in a way reminiscent of one of the arm positions shown on these bought figurines (e.g. No. 2). Both the excavated and bought ivory figurines are often shown with black-filled incisions, black-filled navels, inlaid shell eyes, incised eyes with pupils, inserted nipples, modelled noses (rarely with nostril holes), incised slit mouth (but without the modelled lips of the bought ivory figurines), lumbar dimples, wasp- waists, and ankle projections. Of course several of these features such as navels, lumbar dimples, etc., are not confined to, nor indeed characteristic of, the Predynastic period. The excavated figurine complement as known at present (including figurines of clay and vegetable paste) includes more female figures than males, as does also the group of bought ivory figurines. These excavated figurines often have modelled or turned up feet but unlike the bought ivory figurines they very rarely have toes indicated, even when they are shown with modelled hands and fingers. When excavated ivories do have toes indicated, they are incised on the bottom of the legs without indication of the feet while the bought ivory figurines nearly always have feet modelled with toes indicated and much more rarely have hands and fingers represented. Although both excavated and</page><page sequence="8">ANTHROPOMORPHIC IVORY FIGURINES FROM EGYPT 22I bought figurine complements include standing figures, the excavated complement include several examples in seated position (made of other materials than ivory). Although both bought and excavated figurine complements include a variety of arm positions it is noticeable that, except for those with arms elongated down the side of the body, none of the arm positions are shared by both groups, despite a certain standardiza- tion of arm positions characterizing each group (see Table I, and Ucko I965). Although both excavated and bought complements include 'clothed' figurines the excavated figurines (clay and vegetable paste) are shown with incised or painted 'tattooing' or painted 'clothing', the latter commonly associated with the absence of leg or buttock division, while the bought figurines can be recognized as 'clothed' only by the absence of almost all anatomical details. Although both excavated and bought figurine complements include figures with separated buttocks this anatomical detail is found on under a quarter of the excavated figurines while it is present on over three- quarters of the bought figurines. Both excavated and bought female figurines sometimes have pubic triangles but the excavated examples are incised (including a Badarian ivory example) and triangular in shape. Bought examples, however, have also cut-out or punctured pubic areas and the shapes represented include the distinctive fan. The sexual characteristics of male figures in both groups are more similar. 'Sheaths' are represented from the navel region to the top of the division of the legs. The simple undifferentiated sheath represented on several bought ivory figurines is found also on another bought ivory figurine (No. 9I in Ucko I965) which is otherwise very similar to an excavated ivory figurine of Amratian date from Mahasna (Ayrton &amp; Loat I9II, P1. II, I; Ucko I965, No. 52). The more complex sheaths represented on the bought figurines (e.g. No. 34) are very different in detail from the complex sheath of the excavated figurine which, in addition, has also the penis represented (see drawing of the side of figurine No. 52 in Ucko I965). Both bald figurines and figurines with hair occur in the bought and excavated figurine complements (the bought figurine with hair in a bun stands out from the group). All the bought figurines which are not bald have the 'hair' represented in the same way with braids over the front of the chest and rectangular block hanging down the back of the neck. No excavated predynastic figurine has hair shown in this way despite the variety of hair representations known from excavated material and the small figurine-wigs found during excavations (only one clay bought figurine has the same hair style and the date of this figurine is unclear (Ucko &amp; Hodges I 963, p. 208) ). Unlike the bought figurine complement, the excavated figurines include no figures of mother and child, and no figures of dwarfs. The bought figurine complement, unlike the excavated figurine complement, includes no ivory figurine with punctured necklace, nor ivory figurine with incised black-filled line across the level of the hips. Dynastic: Several of the above-mentioned features (e.g. navels, lumbar dimples, modelled hands and fingers, modelled feet and toes, etc.) of the bought ivory figurines are found also on historic Egyptian representations. Some of the features of the bought ivory figurines which have been seen above to be without parallels among the excavated predynastic figurines find some parallels among historic representations. Small ivory representations are known from the Archaic period onwards, often gaming pieces to be placed on gaming boards. In Saitic times and later, bronze figurines</page><page sequence="9">222 PETER J. UCKO were modelled on pegs, apparently for insertion in the top of staves (Roeder 1956).6 Representations of mother and child are common throughout the history of Egypt, as is also an explicit interest in dwarfs or pygmies (e.g. a letter from Harkhuf to the Pharaoh, Pepy II, telling him that he was bringing back a dancing deneg). One of the most striking single parallels is with the Middle Kingdom 'mechanical toy' from Lisht (Lansing 1934, figs. 31-3). This unique discovery evidences the manufacture of small ivory figurines in the XIIth Dynasty. Whether or not they represent dwarfs their posture is bandy-legged, reminiscent of bought ivory figurines, and they are placed on round or rectangular pegs designed to enable manipulation of the toy. Despite the ingenious refinements of these stands they provide an interesting parallel to the stands of many of the bought ivory figurines. Although the delicate and detailed modelling of these Middle Kingdom ivory figurines is unlike that of the majority of the bought figurines (but see exceptional bought figurines, e.g. No. 36), it is not improbable that less detailed, non-mechanical, toys were made in the Middle Kingdom for, as Lansing pointed out (I 934, pp. 35-6), this toy from Lisht is unparalleled in its delicate manufacture and detail of facial features. 'Had they appeared in the European market without antecedents no one would have been inclined to attribute to them an Egyptian origin' (Lansing 934, p. 30) . Through the kindness of Mr B. Kemp it is now possible to draw attention to a small 'wooden statuette of a naked dwarf woman carrying a child, found by Garstang at Abydos in tomb 352 A'o7. This tomb was situated in an area (with) many Middle Kingdom objects and it would be a great surprise to find an archaic object in this particular area' (B. Kemp, personal communication). This figurine from Abydos closely resembles the two ivory figurines in the Berlin Museum mentioned above, not only in general style, but also in its wig details, its posture, the fact that it carries a baby, the position of the baby's legs and that it stands on a peg. This is strong evidence that the Berlin figurines are really Middle Kingdom in date. The existence in the Middle Kingdom of a variety of small figures of 'dwarfs' which carry children and are placed on pegs may well be significant for the dating of some of the bought ivory figurines which are the subject of this article. According to Lucas (I962, pp. 340-4) blue paint was used in Egypt only from the 4th Dynasty onwards, while inlaid eyes similar to those of Predynastic and bought ivory figurines are also known from several periods of historic Egypt (e.g. Lucas I962, p. 99). The representation of the hair on the bought ivory figurines finds many parallels in the wigs of historic Egyptian representations of almost any date. Frequently historic Egyptian representations have a central parting marked on the hair on top of the face and even this detail is paralleled on the bought ivory figurine No. 39. Similarly, some of the arm positions of the bought ivory figurines which were unparalleled on excavated predynastic figurines are found on dynastic Egyptian representations. Arms modelled down the side of the body are common on historic representations and so also are representations with one arm modelled down the side of the body and one arm crossed on to the chest below the breasts (Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom). Whenever the sheath is represented historically in Egypt it is commonly regarded as a characteristic of a Libyan, as is also the representation of a feather on the head. In one case, however, a representation with sheath shows no clear Libyan characteristics</page><page sequence="10">ANTHROPOMORPHIC IVORY FIGURINES FROM EGYPT 223 (Blackman 1914, P1. 7, Middle Kingdom). One of the ivory bought figurines, No. IO, has a clean central hole in the top of the head which can be presumed to have been for the insertion of something. It is possible to see in this figurine a parallel to historic representations shown with sheath, and feather on the head. Finally, there are several parallels between these bought ivory figurines and several of the ivory figurines excavated at Hierakonpolis and Abydos. Several of the features paralleled have already been mentioned above: use of ivory, arms modelled down the side of the body, one arm down the side of the body and one arm crossed on the chest below the breasts, and hair in braids and rectangular wedge. In addition these groups of ivories from Hierakonpolis and Abydos share other features with the bought ivory figurine group. They have the same small size; some share the same body proportions; some have the buttocks modelled and separated in a way similar to the bought ivory figurines; some are shown on pegs; one at least has the sexual triangle incised in a similar way to that on several bought examples; one example at least has slightly bent knees; several are shown with sheaths, not dissimilar to the more complex bought examples; and some are shown with arms crossed over the abdomen with hands protruding downwards, in exactly the same way as several bought examples. Unfortunately, although several of the Hierakonpolis and Abydos parallels are convincing they do not help much with the problem of dating these bought ivory figurines. Although published as from the Ist Dynasty, the dating of the ivories from Abydos is no easy matter. Again through the kindness of Mr B. Kemp, the situation can be summarized as follows: so-called 'archaic' figures were found in three deposits at Abydos, M64, M65 and M6g9. The date of deposit M64 may be 'any period prior to the mid-Eighteenth Dynasty', the date of deposit M65 'perhaps Middle Kingdom but could be later'. Regarding the date of M6g9 (which contained figurines which perhaps most closely resemble the bought ivory figurines), Mr Kemp writes 'a date no later than the end of the Sixth Dynasty is safer than a post-Sixth Dynasty date purely and simply because this requires no special factors to be taken into consideration; [however,] should the contents of M6g9 indicate otherwise, there is actually nothing to prevent a later date' (B. Kemp, personal communication). Re-analysis of some of the ivories from Hierakonpolis, also published originally as Archaic, has suggested that they may really date from the Middle Kingdom (Baumgartel 1948, pp. 544-50) . NITROGEN CONTENT In view of the difficulty in finding convincing stylistic data by which to date these bought ivory figurines, and the fact that on stylistic grounds individual figurines within the group stand out from the others (see p.2I8 above), it was decided to seek independent dating evidence through chemical tests. The determination of nitrogen content seemed to be the best test7 on the very small quantities of ivory which could be removed from the available figurines.8 Fresh bone contains over 4 per cent nitrogen (and fresh dentine about 3.5 per cent nitrogen), and the percentage falls after burial at a rate depending on the environmental conditions (Oakley i963, p. 26). As a relative dating method the nitrogen content can therefore be applied only to specimens buried under similar conditions. This project was initially made possible through the encouragement and kindness of</page><page sequence="11">224 PETER J. UCKO Dr K. P. Oakley (British Museum, Natural History). Four laboratories have carried out the nitrogen determinations; two by the Kjeldahl and two by the Dumas method. In some instances the Dumas method provided higher values, which would be expected if some of the nitrogen was in oxidized form (this is confirmed by an increase in the Kjeldahl value after pre-treatment with a reducing agent). In some of the cases where specimens were tested before and after water-washing, much of the nitrogen proved to be in water-soluble form, as would be expected for protein breakdown products. As it is still not clear whether total nitrogen or water-insoluble nitrogen gives the best results for nitrogen dating, all available results are given in Table 2. Where no washed specimen was tested, the nitrogen content could not, of course, be greater than that of the unwashed specimen. The different methods of estimating nitrogen content and the limitations of nitrogen dating of such material are being investigated by Dr J. P. Garlick (Department of Anthropology, University College London). Nevertheless the results so far available (see Table 2) warrant preliminary publication. The estimated nitrogen content of ten specimens (including one figurine) of Amratian and Gerzean date (SD 33-63) excavated at Naqada and Ballas ranged from 01 13 per cent to I 4 per cent (washed) and o I9 per cent and I -48 per cent (unwashed), on the basis of sixteen determinations. As the bought ivory figurines have been claimed to originate from Naqada or Ballas (ignoring the later ascription to Saonyah) their nitrogen content should be directly comparable to that of the excavated specimens. Some of the results obtained fall within the range recorded from the excavated material (washed and unwashed) while others are well outside the range and these figurines contain as high a percentage of nitrogen as modern ivory. The very few determinations of Badarian and later predynastic material from the site of Badari give relatively low percentages of nitrogen, which exclude a predynastic date for the bought material, from any provenance such as Badari. It is not at the moment possible to use these results for assigning figurines to a particular period within Egyptian history. Perhaps it will be possible to do something along these lines when results of excavated historic material from many different sites are known. However, it is noticeable that the two figurines Nos. 8 and 36 (one washed and one unwashed) which have been noted as exceptional on stylistic grounds, have nitrogen contents well outside the range obtained from excavated predynastic material from Naqada. It is still too early to decide whether the high results recorded for bought figurines Nos. 8, i i and 36 are due to their later date as compared with the bought ivory figurines Nos. 12, 35 and 37, or to different provenance. It is, however, already clear from this investigation that this bought 'group' of ivory figurines may be heterogeneous either in date and/or provenance. It is to be hoped that more of these figurines will be made available for such chemical analyses, for the importance assigned to this group of bought figurines in discussions about predynastic Egypt warrants all possible attempts to place them in their correct cultural contexts.</page><page sequence="12">APPENDIX.

Dixon, DrJ. P. Garlick, Dr A. Rosenfeld, Professor I. Rouse, Mr H. S. Smith, Mrs L. E. Ucko, and MrJ. L. Williams are due the author's most grateful thanks for valuable advice and discussion during his work on these figurines. 2 This group is, in a sense, an artificial one; it excludes all excavated ivory figures but does not include all bought ivory figures. The group is predominantly made of figures which, although bought through the accidents of history around the turn of the century on three different occasions, have been referred to as similar in the published literature (see below). In addition this group includes a few figurines which have not been grouped with the others in the literature but which closely resemble figurines which are part of the original group (e.g. Nos. 24 and 3 ). It excludes other bought figurines which have not been grouped with the others in the literature and which do not closely resemble figurines of the original group (e.g. those in the Berlin Museum, referred to below) and it also excludes bought ivory 'pin' figures. All the bought ivory figurines not included in this article, as well as excavated ivory figurines, are catalogued in Ucko (i965). 3 The tracing of one group of these figurines was accomplished by advertisement in the Museum's Bulletin together with the efficiency and help of Mr R. L. Charles (Cardiff). Detailed descriptions of these figurines, as well as acute observation and comment were provided by Mr J. L. Williams of the Institute of Archaeology, London. Figurine No. 45 has at present a face attached to it. However it is clear from the way in which the head has been stuck to the figure that it is not the original. As will be seen below, protruding ears are never shown on the same figure as hair braids. Similarly all figures with hair braids have also a rectangle of hair hanging down the back of the neck. These two observations support the contention that this head does not fit this body for, as it stands, Figure No. 45 is bald with projecting ears and hair braids on the chest. Nevertheless there is no reason against assuming this head to have belonged to one of the figurines of this group. It may well be, therefore, that only three figurines have remained untraced, for this head presumably belongs to one of the Figures Nos. 47-50. The co-operation of the following museum officials is gratefully acknowledged. Messrs T. G. H. James and A. F. Shore (British Museum, London); Dr S. Curto (Turin Museum); Dr M. Buhl (Copenhagen Museum); Mr J. Vandier (Louvre Museum, Paris); Dr A. J. Arkell and Mr H. S. Smith (Petrie Collection, London); Dr D. Dixon (Wellcome Historical Museum, London); Mr R. L.

The two figurines in the collection of the late Captain Spencer Churchill will be sold at a forthcoming sale and dispersed once again. The figures in the Wellcome Historical Museum have become part of the Petrie Collection, London. 4The author wishes to record his grateful thanks to Miss P. Aylott for her photographic work. 5The question of recognizing forgeries of predynastic material has been considered elsewhere (Ucko &amp; Hodges I963). 6 The author is grateful to Mr BarryJ. Kemp (Cambridge) for this reference. 7 The low fluorine content of a few specimens tested showed that, this technique(Oakley I963, pp. 25-8) was inapplicable for relative dating of this material. Presumably the dry conditions of Egypt leads to only minimal accumulation of fluorine in ancient Egyptian remains. 8 Only through the clear-sighted co-operative attitude of Dr David Dixon, Dr Anthony J. Arkell and Mr Harry S. Smith has it proved possible to obtain the necessary samples for this part of the study to be undertaken. 9 The author is indebted to Dr D. Dixon for permission to draw attention to these details. For their possible significance, see Morse, Brothwell &amp; Ucko (I964). 10 Although it is impossible to be definite about the head of this figure, the fact that it does not fit cleanly on the body and appears to be made of bone (or ivory) with very different patination from the body, supports the view that this is not the original head. It cannot be confidently accepted as a genuine head of any of these figurines. It is clear from the body of this figure that hair braids were never represented and that the original head was therefore bald (and was probably shown with protruding ears).
