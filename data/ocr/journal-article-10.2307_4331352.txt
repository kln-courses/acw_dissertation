Historia plantarum 3.3.5 Introduction In Historia plantarum (HP)' and De causis plantarum (Cp),2 Theophrastus (c. 371-287 B.C.)3 laid a wide and solid foundation for botany, including the morphology and function of the flowers, and the relationship between flowers and fruits (HP 1.13; 1.14.1-2; 3.3.4_8).4 The insufficient understanding, at the time, of the flower and its role did not affect Theophrastus's ability to grasp the need for pollination/fertilization in the dioecious date-palm: he described the practice of artificial pollination of the female date tree by the inflorescence of the male and compared it to the sexual process among fish.5 I Enquiry into Plants, with English trans. by Sir Arthur Hort, 2 vols.

The sexual processes in plants were experimentally demonstrated, with the dioecious black mulberny and other plants, by R. J. Camerarius just before 1694, and were established only during the second half of the nineteenth century.6 The date-palm is the only plant described by Theophrastus in which the terms "male" and "female" are used in the modem sense. However, these epithets also appear in HP and CP in relation to other plants, with other meanings. This article reviews and sorts the different meanings of these terms in the botanical writings of Theophrastus. The Meanings of the Terms "Male" and "Female" Theophrastus himself explains the division of plants into "male" and "female" kinds as common usage in his time: "in all [wild] trees, taking them by kinds, there are a number of differences; one is common to all, that whereby people distinguish female and male, the first bearing, the other (in some kinds) not. When both bear, the female bears the finer and more plentiful fruit (except of those who call these trees male, as some do)" (HP 3.8.1; n. a to CP 1.22.1).7 This distinction is based on the knowledge of rhizotomai (root-cutters),8 who exploited mainly wild plants, and cultivators. In CP, Theophrastus gives "physiological" reasoning for the bearing of and the failure to bear fruit in female and male trees, respectively: Among wild trees the case where some trees of the same kind bear but others do not, these trees being called "male" and "female," comes under . . . other cause that ... account for trees that fail to bear: it is close texture, strength and good feeding that makes them barren, for the trees expend all their resources on themselves. But fruit production requires a natural residue, since from this comes the fruit, like the semen in animals. 53 (1966), 213-214; Morton, History (above n. 4), p. 38; Morton, "Pliny" (above, n. 4), p. 93; M.

(CP 2.10.1)10 In what follows (CP 2.10.2), Theophrastus gives nameless cases of trees that are barren in cultivation and in the wild. He also mentions the banyan (Ficus benghalensis), a very large tree that, produces large leaves and aerial roots but only very small fruits, and in a rather small quantity in proportion to its dimension (CP 2.10.2). Other meanings of male and female are also used: "The distinction between 'male' and 'female' may, according to the woodmen, be said to be common to all trees. Any wood of a 'male' tree, when ... cut ... gives shorter lengths, is more twisted, harder to work, and darker .. .; while the 'female' gives better lengths" (HP 3.9.3). This woodcutters' distinction is given in another passage with examples: "Again the 'male' trees have more knots than the 'female' in those trees in which both forms are found, as cypress, silver-fir, hop- hombeam, I1 cornelian cherry ... and wild trees have more knots than trees in cultivation" (HP 1.8.2). Suzanne Amigues commented that "La distinction entre sujets 'males' et sujets 'femelles' se fonde chez Thdophraste sur des critbres variables, de valeur scientifique trds in6gale" (n. 1 to Recherches 1.8). To this one may add that Theophrastus shows a deep understanding of the right terms to be used, but out of respect to common usage and to previous and contemporary authors, he maintains the "tradition" (as he does with the term "root").12 This survey of the plants mentioned by Theophrastus in which the terms "male" and "female" are used is divided into the following groups: the dioe- cious date-palm; other dioecious plants (in which sexuality could potentially also have been discovered); monoecious plants; and plants with bisexual flowers. Theophrastus and other ancient scholars are presented here, mostly, in quotations from English translations. Paraphrasing their words in modem terminology may easily ascribe to them knowledge they most likely did not have. 9 Einarson and Link compared it to Aristotle's view (On Parts of Animals, 2.5.65 lb 1 3-15): "Again fat animals are less fertile for the same reason: what should have gone from the blood to become generative fluid and semen is used up on fat and suet" (n. b to CP 2.10.1). 10 Here he expresses ideas about the allocation of resources in plants, a subject not studied before the twentieth century. See Alden S. Crafts and Carl E. Crisp, Phloem Transport in Plants (San Francisco: Freeman, 1971). " The hop-hombeam is not a clear-cut case. In contrast to the woodcutters' distinction between "male" and "female" Ostrya carpinifolia (HP 1.8.2), in HP 3.10.3 he says: "ostrya, has . . . but one kind ... and its fruit is small, oblong and yellow like barley"; however, in CP 5.12.9 it is mentioned among trees that bear no fruit (more in n. 10 to Recherches 3.10). 12 See Moshe Negbi, "Theophrastuson Geophytes,"Bot. J. Linn. Soc., 100 (1989), 15-43.</page><page sequence="4">320 MOSHE NEGBI The Dioecious Date-Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) Theophrastus was aware of the male and female trees of the dioecious date- palm: "There are several kinds of palms . . . to take first the most important differences; some are fruitful some are not; and it is from this latter kind that the people of Babylon make ... furniture. Again of the fruitful trees some are 'male,' others 'female'; and these differ from each other in that the 'male' first bears a flower on its spathe, while the 'female' at once bears a small fruit" (HP 2.6.6). The second kind of palm-tree, from which the Babylonians made furniture, grew, most probably, in wild or spontaneous groves where natural wind pollination was not very effective, and both male and female trees were felled when necessary (n. 10 to Recherches 2.10); until the 1950s there was such a forest of date-palm trees in Faiyum, Lower Egypt.13 Theophrastus's view that the ovaries in the female flower are fruits is a negligible "error," especially with respect to his most important contribution: descriptions of artificial pollination of the female date tree and of its postfertilization con- sequences - namely, the prevention of fruit drop, which is presented several times: In the date-palms there are ... remedies that come from the males to the females; for it is the males that effect the retention and full concoction of the fruit, and some people call this process, from its similarity to the process in the figs, olyntha'zein.14 (HP 2.8.4; n. a to CP 2.9.15)15 What occurs in the date-palm, while not the same as caprification, never- theless bears a certain resemblance to it ... . For the flower and dust [pollen] and down [stamens or anthers] from the male date-palm ... [are] sprinkled on the fruit ... and ... the fruit remains on the tree. Something similar in a way to this is seen to happen with fish, when the male sprinkles his milt on the eggs as they are laid. But resemblances can be found even in things widely separate. (CP 2.9.15)16 The relatively late appearance of the English translation of CP, where the comparison between the date-palm and the fish is made, caused a number of 13 S.

'6Artificial pollination in the date is described in some detail: "When the male palm is in flower, they at once cut off the spathe of which the flower is, just as it is, and shake the bloom with the flower and the dust over the fruit of the female, and if this is done to it, it retains the fruit and does not shed it" (HP 2.8.4).</page><page sequence="5">MALE AND FEMALE IN THEOPHRASTUS'S BOTANICAL WORKS 321 biologists and historians of biology to minimize Theophrastus's understand- ing of sexuality in the former. The practice of artificial pollination of the female date-palm tree is pre- sumed by several authors to antedate history, albeit with no evidence.17 The earliest historical evidence regarding artificial pollination is found in Akkadian texts, including paragraphs 64-66 of the Code of Hammurabi (eighteenth century B.C.). In these documents there are specific terms for the inflorescences of the female (uhinnu) and male (rikbu) date trees and for pollination/fertilization (rukkuba). Note the semantic relation between rik- bu and rukkuba in Akkadian. In Mishnaic Hebrew the word markivin, for the act of fastening the male inflorescence on the female date-palm, comes from the root rkb ( t31 ).18 The artistic depiction of artificial pollination appears first, as far as I am aware, in a ninth-century B.C. Aramaic relief from Tell Halaf (Biblical Gozan), in northeastern Syria; it shows a "man climbing a date palm by a ladder, apparently for fertilizing the female tree by applying the male inflorescence to the flowers."19 Assyrian wall reliefs from the palace of Ashumasirpal 11 (883-859 B.C.) at Nimrud show super- natural figures (griffins, genii) attending palm-like sacred trees. E. B. Tylor, in 1890, interpreted these scenes as the symbolic artificial pollination of the date-palm; he "suggested that the sacred trees represented . . . date-palms and that the conical objects brought [by the supernatural figures] close to the female flower ... were the male inflorescences."20 The Tell Halaf relief, in which the palm tree is barely stylized, is a more realistic depiction of this horticultural activity.21 1 Darleen A.

The method of cultivation is the same as for the figs, particularly in regard to the practice of taking the fruit of what the Greek call the "male" palm and tying it into the "female" or date-bearing tree, to allow the gall-fly to enter the fruit and ripen it and prevent it from dropping off. For it is a fact that the male palms have the gall-fly in their fruit, like wild figs.23 Theophrastus, who most probably read Herodotus,24 changed the homology between fig and date into analogy. The last phrase from HP 2.8.4 strengthens our notion that Theophrastus, who was aware of sex in the date-palm, was not so sure about it in the fig tree: "In the case of both the fig and of the date it appears that the 'male' renders aid [in preventing fruit fall] to the 'female,' - for the fruit-bearing tree is called 'female' - but while in the latter case there is a union of the two sexes, in the former the result is brought about somewhat differently." The date-palm is probably the only dioecious plant described by Theo- phrastus in which the terms "male" and "female" are used in their modem sense.25 This is why his analogy to the life of fish does not sound strange to 22 In a wild date-palm population, or in a seed-planted grove, the male- to female-tree ratio is 1: 1; Zohary and Hopf, Domestication (above, n. 17). But in date-palm groves, in which plants have been propagated vegetatively, Pliny (c. 24-79 A.D.) describes the custom of planting a minimum number of male trees: Pliny, Natural History, with English trans. by H. Rackham, vols. IV-V, and by W. H. S. Jones, vols. VI-VII (London: Heinemann, 1968), 13.34-35 (hereafter, NH). Modem date-palm groves have separate female and male plots, pollination is fully artificial, and the pollen of a single male tree (1 kg dry weight) suffices to pollinate 40-50 females: S. Stoller, "The Date-Palm," in Fruit Cultivation, ed. M. Margalith (Tel Aviv: Hassadeh, 1961), pp. 130-148 (in Hebrew); Stoller, Date-Palm Cultivation (above, n. 13); S. Gazit, pers. comm. 23 Herodotus, The Histories, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt (Harmonsworth: Penguin, 1954), p. 92; Herodotus, with English trans. by A. D. Godley, 4 vols., rev. ed. (London: Heinemann, 1960), I, 193. 24 Amigues (Recherches, I, xxiii) relates Theophrastus's knowledge of date-palm cultivation in Coele-Syria and Babylon to the report by Alexander's historian Callisthenes of Olynthus (c. 360-328 B.C.). On the other hand, she traces the error of comparing fertilization in the fig and the palm to Herodotus, whom neither she nor the translators to the English (in their introductions to HP and CP) mentions as a literary source of Theophrastus (n. 10 to Recherches 2.8). Nonetheless, the similarities between Herodotus's and Theophrastus's treatments (Herodotus I, 193, vs. HP 2.6.6 and HP 2.8.4) of palm pollination are too apparent to be ignored. Another example is their treatment of silphium in Cyrenaica (Herodotus IV, 158 and 169 vs. H.P. 6.3.3). 25 Zirkle, "Introduction" (above, n. 5): "it could have been the lack of prominent dioecious plants in the flora and cultivated crops of Europe that limited popular knowledge of plant</page><page sequence="7">MALE AND FEMALE IN THEOPHRASTUS'S BOTANICAL WORKS 323 us. Theophrastus, however, was aware that this "sexual" process takes place only in one or two plants species: That the fruit does not remain on the female date-palm unless you shake the flower of the male over it ... occurs only in the date-palm, but is similar to the caprification of the fig-tree. From these instances one would be most inclined to infer that even a female tree cannot by itself bear completely formed fruit; except that this should hold not of just one or two female trees but of all or most of them, since this is how we decide the nature of the class of female. And in the case before us that of the date-palm is very strange indeed,26 since caprification is considered to have a clear explanation. (CP 3.18.1)27 Other Dioecious Plants Species of Pistacia (Anacardiaceae) The dioecious terebinths (tereminthos and also terebinthos), having male and female forms, are described as follows: The terebinth has a "male" and a "female" form. The "male" is barren, which is why it is called "male"; the fruit of one of the "female" forms is red from the first and as large as an unripe lentil; the other produces a green fruit which subsequently turns red ... becomes eventually black and is as large as a [broad] bean, but resinous and somewhat aromatic. About Ida and in Macedonia28 the tree is low, shrubby and twisted, but in the Syrian Damascus, where it abounds, it is tall and handsome ... . It bears also some hollow bag-like growths in which are found little creatures like gnats, and resinous sticky matter. (HP 3.15.3-4) sexuality"; this changed after the discovery of the New World, when "a second dioecious plant was introduced to the Europeans, and its sexuality was also described in the herbals. This ... was ... Carica papaya" (p. xv). The delay in the discovery of sexuality in plants was attributed by Sarton ("Artificial Fertilization" [above, n. 201, p. 13) to the Aristotelian denial of sexuality in plants, the strength of the Master's influence in the Middle Ages, and the absence of experimental spirit. 26Note how Pliny treats this disharmony between the date-palm and the rest of the plants: "The most devoted students of nature report that trees, or rather indeed all the products of the earth and even grasses, are of both sexes, a fact which it may at this place be sufficient to state in general terms, although in no trees is it more manifest than in the palm" (NH 13.31). Does Pliny refer to Aristotle's view that in plants the two sexes are blended (Generation of Animals, with English trans. by A. L. Peck [London: Heinemann, 1963], 23.730b34-35, 731a1-14)? 27 Caprification is explained in CP 2.9.5-6. See also Lorch, "Discovery of Sexuality" (above, n. 5), pp. 212-222. 28 Theophrastus studied the botany of Mount Ida in the Troad, Asia Minor, and in Macedonia, while with Aristotle in Assos and Stagira in 344-347 (CP, I, vii).</page><page sequence="8">324 MOSHE NEGBI Here Theophrastus seems to be describing two species: Pistacia terebinthus (closely related to P. palaestina) and P. atlantica, both of which grow in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Greece, and the Aegean Islands. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter, which is - most probably - the handsome terebinth of Damascus.29 The fact that the terebinths' fruit size and color received much attention in Theophrastus may indicate that the fruits were in his time as they are still being used in the Near East.30 The smaller fruits of the P. terebinthus and P. palaestina are consumed whole, either fresh or roasted. The larger ones of P. atlantica, which turn a coppery green when mature, are used for making soap; their bitter pericarp is inedible, but their kernels are eaten after being roasted.31 The identification of one of these terebinths may be aided by the perfect description in HP of the galls of P. terebinthus.32 29Pistacia terebinthus and P. atlantica inhabit, inter alia, the areas mentioned in HP. Two subspecies of P. terebinthus: subsp. terebinthus and subsp. palaestina (syn P. palaestina) grow in Turkey, the first being limited to northwest Turkey and common also in Greece and its islands. Both subspecies are shrubs or small trees up to 6 m, and are often galled. P. atlantica (syn. P. mutica) is a tree up to 7 m, a recorded from Greece, the Aegean, Turkey, Cyprus, and the Syrian Desert, often as a forest relic: F. Yaltirik, "Pistacia L.," in Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands, ed. P. H. Davis (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1967) II, 544-549, maps 65, 66; also Michael Zohary, "Geobotanical Analysis of the Syrian Desert," Palestine J. Bot., Rehovot ser., 3 (1940), 46-95; idem, "'Forests and Forest Remnants of Pistacia atlantica Desf. in Palestine and Syria," ibid., pp. 158-161. In HP the terebinths are catalogued as evergreens (1.9.3; 3.3.3); did he confuse the deciduous P. terebinthus and P. atlantica with the evergreen mastic (P. lentiscus; HP 9.1.2; 9.4.7)? 30 Fruit size is the only difference between the two Theophrastian terebinths, not recorded in Turkey, being 5-6 x 4-6 mm in Pistacia terebinthus and 5-8 x 5-6 mm in P. atlantica. How- ever, in M. Zohary, Flora Palaestina (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1972), II, 296-300, the fruit of P. palaestina is c. 5 mm in diameter, and that of P. atlantica 5-8 x 5-6 mm; the former is of a lentil's size, though the latter is smaller than a broad bean.

Kislev, "References to the Pistachio Tree in Near East Geographical Names," Palestine Explor. Quart., 117 (1989), 133-138. 32 The galls described by Theophrastus ("hollowing bag-like growth") may certainly be those recorded on Pistacia palaestina in Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon, on P. terebinthus in Turkey (common in the coastal area between Istanbul and Adana), and on P. khinjouk in Iraq, which are formed by the aphid Baizongia pistaciae.

It seems unlikely that Theophrastus would discuss P. vera in much detail in one place (HP 3.15.3-4), and treat it as simply a nameless exotic nut in another (HP 4.4.7). More than three centuries later, the pistachio nut was referred to, by Pliny, as an even more obscure plant (NH 12.25). Note also that there are no remains of P. vera in the Near East from "before classical times," and that the two fruits found in late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Greece are questionable.33 Since pollination in P. terebinthus and P. atlantica (HP 3.15.3-4), and in the mastic (P. lentiscus), was not critical to the resin harvesters (HP 9.2.1-2), a sexual process (or prevention of fruit shedding) was not even suggested. Nevertheless, pollination is rather critical to the production of the exotic pistachio (P. vera) nut, heard by Theophrastus to be superior to the almond (HP 4.4.7). In modem pistachio plantations, one male tree ensures adequate pollination of six females. Because male trees tend to shed their pollen before the pistils are receptive, pollen is sometimes gathered, dried, and stored, to be later spread in the orchard.34 How old this tradition is I do not know, but if Theophrastus was familiar with it he would probably have compared it to the date-palm. Rhus (Anacardiaceae) "Of the sumach (Rhus coriaria) they recognise a 'male' and a 'female' form, the former being barren, the latter fruit-bearing" (HP 3.18.5). Since Rhus, like Pistacia, is dioecious (though the former is sometimes polygamous),35 what follows is a description of the branches and leaves that does not distinguish between the two forms. The inflorescence and infructesence of the sumach are described as clusters and compared to those of the grape. Although the sumach was used mainly for tanning, a drug called rous was prepared from its fruit (HP 3.18.5) - yet sexuality was not even suspected.

However, male and female trees are not distinguished. Monoecious Plants On the Differences in Firs (Abies), Pines (Pinus, Pinaceae), and Cypress (Cupressus, Cupressaceae) Theophrastus describes firs that differ in wood anatomy, as known to the woodmen (HP 1.8.2), as well as in the morphology of the trunk, foliage, and cones: The silver-fir is either "male" or "female," and has differences in its leaves; those of the "male" are sharper, more needle-like and more bent ... the whole tree has a more compact appearance. There are also differences in the wood, that of the "female" being whiter, softer and easier to work, while the whole trunk is longer; that of the "male" is less of a uniform colour, thicker and harder, has more heart-wood, and is ... inferior .... In the cone of the "male" are a few seeds at the apex, while that of the "female," according to .. . the Macedonian ... contain none at all." (HP 3.9.6) According to needle morphology, the "male" is now considered to be A. cephalonica and the "female" A. alba (syn. A. pectinata). The former is more common in Greece, whereas in the Rhodope mountains (northern Greece and neighboring countries) both species grow (n. 15 to Recherches 3.9). Though the firs are monoecious, there are no morphological descriptions of the male and female strobili (cones); however, references are given to the olive oil 37HP 1.6.1; 1.9.7; 1.10.10; 1.12.1; 1.13.1; 1.13.4; 5.3.4. 38 See Introduction and n. 25, above. 39HP 1.11.2; 1.14.2; 4.2.4. 40 See Michael Zohary and Naomi Feinbrun, Analytical Flora of Palestine, 2nd ed.

Two pines are described, a male and a female. The distinctions are mainly those of woodcutters and carpenters, with some mention of fruitlessness and resin quality given by rhizotomai: The people of Macedonia say that there is also a kind of fir which bears no fruit whatever, in which the "male" (Aleppo pine) is shorter and has harder leaves, while the "female" (Corsican pine)41 is taller and has glistening delicate leaves which are more pendent. Moreover the timber of the "male" kind has much heart-wood, is tough, and warps in joinery work, while that of the "female" is easy to work, does not warp, and is softer. (HP 3.9.2) Different parts of these pines were used for extracting pitch by burning: the shoots of the "male" in Syria and Macedonia, and the roots of the "female" in Macedonia (HP 9.2.3-4). Another monoecious conifer, the cypress, is described as having male and female kinds (HP 1.8.2; 5.4.1). The most frequent of the wild cypresses, Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontalis, is now considered to be the male cypress, and C. s. var. sempervirens, the female (n. 1 to Recherches 1.8). According to HP 2.2.6 this quality is not fixed, since "frequently seed of a 'female' cypress produces a 'male' tree" (cf. HP 3.2.3). This remark is true: in sowing the fastigiate form ("female") a great number of pagoda shaped form ("male") comes up.42 It seems logical to suggest that in the case of the firs, pines, and cypresses, as in a number of the following cases, Theophrastus describes the morphological distinctions of entities called "male" and "female" by woodmen, carpenters, rhizotomai, and cultivators. The two kinds of inflorescence in the monoecious plants did not receive equal treatment by Theophrastus. We have seen that the male cones of the firs were described by him as saffron-colored flowers (HP 1.13.1). Elsewhere he questions whether the male flowers (inflorescences) of the pines and firs, and of a number of monoecious dicotyledons, are flowers or not: There is ... a doubt about the flower of some trees ... . Some think that the oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) bears flowers, and also the filbert (Corylus avellana, Betulaceae), the chestnut (Castanea vulgaris, Fagaceae) and 4' Though Hort and Amigues agree that the male pine is P. halepensis, the fonner held that the female is Corsican pine (P. larico) and the latter that it is "pin noir" (P. nigra; index of Enquiry, and n. 3 to Recherches 3.9). 42 Amigues n. 12 to Recherches 2.2. Cypress seed in Israel are also heterozygotic (Prof. J. Riov and Dr. M. Sachs, pers. comm.).</page><page sequence="12">328 MOSHE NEGBI even the fir and Aleppo pine; some however think that none of these has a flower, but that, - resembling and corresponding to the wild figs which drop off prematurely, we have in the nuts [filbert and chestnut] the catkin, in the oak the oak-moss, in the pine the "flowering tuft." (HP 3.3.8) Note that in these plants, Theophrastus is not in doubt about female flowers or inflorescences: when they are referred to, these colorless female flowers are called fruits, as in the date-palm. Plants with Bisexual Flowers Tilia (Jiliaceae) and Comus (Cornaceae) These two genera, having bisexual flowers, also had, according to Greek woodcutters, female and male fonns: The lime [Tilia] has both "male" and "female" forms, which differ in ... general appearance, in ... the wood, and in being respectively fruit- bearing and sterile. The wood in the "male" tree is hard, yellow, more branched, closer, and ... more fragrant; that of the "female" is whiter. The bark of the "male" is thicker, and when stripped off, is unbending ... that of the "female" is thinner and flexible; men make their writing cases out of it.43 The "male" has neither fruit nor flower, but the "female" has both flower and fruit; the flower is cup-shaped, and appears alongside of the stalk of the leaf [bract], or alongside of next year's winter-bud on a separate stalk; it is green, when in the cup-like stage, but brownish as it opens; it appears at the same time as in the cultivated trees. The fruit is rounded oblong as large as a bean, resembling the fruit of the ivy; when mature, it has five angular projections ... which meet in a point ... The mature fruit ... shows some small fine seeds. (HP 3.10.4-5) Amigues treated this case and cleared up the inconsistencies of Arthur Hort. It seems that the male and female limes represent two species growing in Greek forests, and even occur side by side in some areas. The male lime (T. tomentosa, syn. T. argentea) fruit is nearly always sterile, but it is not true that it "has neither fruit nor flower" as Theophrastus says, and the female (T. platyphylos) was even less known to him (index of Enquiry, II, 482; n. 15 to Recherches 3.1 0). Kraneia (Cornus) has "male" and "female" forms (HP 1.8.2), similar to those of the lime (HP 3.12.1-2), which are also regarded as two taxa: the male 43 See also HP 1.5.5.</page><page sequence="13">MALE AND FEMALE IN THEOPHRASTUS'S BOTANICAL WORKS 329 is Cornus mas and the female (C. femina of the Herbals) is C. sanguinea. In some places Theophrastus refers to Lonicera xylosteum (Caprifoliaceae) as a female kraneia (n. 7 to Recherches 3.4; n. 1 to Recherches 3.12). Of the cornelian cherry there is a "male" and a "female" kind (cornell), and the latter bears a corresponding name ... . The wood of the "male" tree has no heart, but is hard throughout, like horn in closeness and sttength; whereas that of the "female" tree has heart-wood and is softer and goes into holes; whereas it is useless for javelins. The height of the "male" tree is at most twelve cubits, the length of the longest Macedonian spear, the stem up to the point where it divides not being very tall. (HP 3.12.1-2) The "male" and "female" epithets were those of woodcutters and, most probably, of javelin-makers, before the finer botanical differences had been determined. Sorbus (Rosaceae) The sorbs are also of two kinds, based mainly on fruit quality: "the 'female' which bears fruit and the 'male' which is barren. There are moreover differ- ences in the fruit of the 'female' kind; in some forms it is round, in others oblong or egg-shaped. There are also differences in taste; the round fruits are generally more fragrant and sweeter, the oval ones are sour and less fragrant" (HP 3.12.6). In what follows (HP 3.12.7-9), there is a description of the common features of the male and female kinds. In Enquiry, both sorbs are treated as Sorbus domestica. In Recherches (n. 21 to 3.12) they are two species: the "female" is S. domestica and the barren "male" is S. aucuparia, on the grounds that the latter's fruit is not eaten by man. On Rushes "It remains to speak of the rush .... Of this there are three kinds as some dis- tinguish, the 'sharp' rush, which is barren and is called 'male' (Juncus actus, Juncacea); the 'fruiting' kind which we call the 'black-head' because it has black fruit (Schoenus nigricans, Cyperaceae); this is stouter and fleshier; and the third the 'entire rush,' as it is called (Scirpus holoschoenus, Cyperaceae), which is distinguished by its size, stoutness and fleshiness" (HP 4.12.1). The scientific names given in Enquiry are also accepted in Recherches. Here Theophrastus labels the common name of the barren rush "male" - yet the fruiting and the stout and fleshy rushes are not labeled "female."</page><page sequence="14">330 MOSHE NEGBI Inducible Male and Female Forms in Turnip (Brassica rapa, Brassicaceae) Theophrastus talks about several kinds of turnips, probably mostly as told by cultivators, and then he qualifies this: "but some say that the only difference is between the 'male' and the 'female' [turnips], and that both forms come from the same seeds. In order to produce 'female' plants it is said that the seed should be sown thinly, for that, if it is sown thick, the result is all 'male' plants; and that the same result follows if the seed is sown in poor soil. Wherefore, when they are shifting plants for seeding, they plant the seedlings wide apart" (HP 7.4.3; cf. Pliny, NH 18.129). While in this passage Theophrastus does not say what part of the plant has the male or female shape, in CP 5.6.9 he says that roots and shoots may take a different kind of shape depending on the season of sowing; we presume that in the case of the turnip he means that of the root. Pliny explains the distinction between "male" and "female" tumips: "medical men class the round plants in this group as being of the male sex and the more spread out and curved ones as female, the latter being superior in sweetness and easier to store; though after being repeatedly sown they turn into male plants" (NH 19.75). From both Theophrastus and Pliny it appears that the "male" and "female" forms of the turnip are not two taxa: they are tumips that differ in their shape and quality due in different cultivation methods, and perhaps to other environmental variables as well. The Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum, Solanaceae) Note that the medicinal and aphrodisiac mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) has in HP (9.8.8; 9.9.1) one kind of root. Dioscorides describes male, female, and morion forms of the mandrake, ascribing to the male medicinal value. Pliny, his contemporary, says that the "pounded root of ... mandrake cures ... the eye" and that there are male (white) and female (black) kinds of it; the male is called also morion and hippophlomos (NH 25.147-150). Josephus tells how to dig its root while scarifying the life of a dog (Wars, 7.178-185), a legend illustrated more than four hundred years later in Codex Aniciae Julianae. The aphrodisiac effect through the anthropomorphic "male" and "female" shapes is hinted at, probably for the first time, in the illustrations of alphabetic materia medica from the sixth-century Codex Aniciae Julianae and the seventh-century Codex Neapolitanus.44 44John M.

Plants so-termed possess, according to those naming them, features other than the sexual differences between male and female in man or animal - or, as it has already been articulated, "some characters associated with maleness or femaleness."45 To which Theophrastus did not add, as far as I am aware, an unflattering view of the female: in many cases, female vs. male means fruitfulness as opposed to complete or relative fruitlessness, probably as labeled by rhizotomai and cultivators; in other cases, female and male epithets are used to describe facile vs. difficult wood to cut and to shape, as labeled by woodcutters and carpenters. Theophrastus used these terms to describe differences. His descriptions are clear enough, in many cases, to allow botanists of our time to name the plants. Such are the "6male" and "female" firs: Abies cephalonica and A. alba; cypresses: Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontalis, and C. s. var. sempervirens; pines: Pinus halepensis and P. niger; and limes: Tilia tomentosa and T. platyphylos. In only one case, that of the date-palm, in which the male tree is fruitless and the female is fruitful, did Theophrastus understand the sexual process. In this plant, known to him mainly from oral and written sources the latter including Herodotus and Callisthenes of Olynthus46 he described the male and female trees and interpreted the artificial pollination practice as a sexual union between materials from the male flower and the female fruit. It may be stated that the practice of artificial pollination in the date-palm led him to the understanding of sexuality in plants. In other dioecious plants - whether having "male" and "female" kinds, like species of Pistacia and Rhus coriaria, Trees (New York: Tudor, 1960), pp. 90-91. See also J. Bouquet, Figure de la mandragore, plant demonique (Paris: Etienne Chiron, 1936); Harold N. and Alma L.

One may consider that the use of male and female epithets for plant names, before Theophrastus, is derived from a naive attitude, and not from a derogatory view of the other sex that is not uncommon in ancient Greek medicine and biology and in modem science; see (Lloyd, Science above, n. 8), pp. 58-111; Ruth Bleier, Sciences and Gender (New York: Pergamon, 1984); A.

It is noteworthy that the description of the "sexual process" in the date-palm comes in a chapter that begins: "Trees which are apt to shed their fruit before ripening it," and in which the prevention of fruit drop is dealt with (HP 2.8). However, other reported cases of fruit retaining, even that of the fig, were not considered by him to be a consequence of a sexual process.47 One may speculate that Theophrastus was close to an understanding of sexuality in two other plants: Again some flowers are sterile, as in cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) which grow at the ends of the shoot, and ... men pluck them off, for they hinder the growth of the cucumber. And they say that in the citron (Citrus medica) those flowers which have a kind of distaff (the pistil) growing in the middle are fruitful, but those that have it not are sterile.48 And we must consider whether it occurs also in any other flowering plants that they produce sterile flowers or not. (HP 1 .13.4) A comparison of fertile and sterile flowers of both species might have led Theophrastus to interesting conclusions. But the exotic citron was growing in Media and Persia (HP 4.4.2-4), refused to grow elsewhere (Pliny, NH 12.15- 16), and most probably was not known to Theophrastus at first hand.49 Acknowledgments My sincere thanks are due to Dr. R.

However, when he tries to explain the process in the date-palm he refers to the cultivated fig as a female (HP 2.8.4; CP 3.18. 1). See also nn. 1- 16 to Recherches 2.8; Friedrich G.
