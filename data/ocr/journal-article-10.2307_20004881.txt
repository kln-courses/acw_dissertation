Stud. 7, pp. I 69-I 74 REVIEW ARTICLES GEOFFREY PARRINDER INDIAN STUDIES It sometimes appears that studies of Indian religion are declining in value and the market is being flooded with the worst kind of 'comparative religion', and then there come vintage years like I969-I970 with outstanding books which redress the balance and rank among the finest productions of scholar ship. There were several books of the first importance and a number of lesser but interesting studies. R. C. Zaehner's The Bhagavad-Gita (Clarendon Press, /4. 20) is his long awaited critical and theological commentary on this famous scripture, the fruit of years of teaching and research. It is probably the most important commentary on any non-Biblical text to appear in this century, essential to any library of Indian religion, public or private, and significant for any theologian or philosopher. Professor Zaehner is our most distinguished expert in the wide fields of the comparative study of religions, with un rivalled knowledge of the languages and teachings of Hinduism, Zoro astrianism and Islam, and he writes with authority, attention to detail, charm and occasional pungency. Although expensive his book is full value for money, beginning with forty pages of introduction to the major themes of the text, followed by a complete prose translation. The bulk of the work is a verse by verse commentary, with romanised Sanskrit text, translation again, and comments ranging from a single line to several pages on one verse. For good measure a sixty-page appendix sets out again the principal doctrines of the Gita, but knowing that students will not look up simple references the texts are repeated in full for each doctrine. Finally a detailed index is valuable for tracing back still further subjects, for example two and a half columns on Krishna. The Glta is a much translated work, with over fifty English versions, but from the outset Zaehner states his intention of letting the book speak for itself. Most commentators, from Radhakrishnan's monistic interpretation to Otto's search for an Ur-Gita, have sought to impose their own views on the text. The few exceptions are Hill, whose comments are very short, Edgerton who is so literal as sometimes to be unintelligible, and Lamotte whose slighter work often anticipated the present study. Zaehner takes the Gita as a whole and his conviction that it is far more unitary than most scholars have been willing to concede was a determining factor in deciding to write</page><page sequence="2">I 70 GEOFFREY PARRINDER his own edition. His studies of mysticism had revealed the division between those who sought liberation from time and the world, and those mystics who regarded love as central. The Glta belongs to the second class, yet most commentators have been so deluded by the extreme Vedantin monism of Sankara that they have completely missed the whole purpose of the Gita which, as only Lamotte saw, was to show that the return of the soul to Brahman was only a stage on the road to love of the personal God, where Krishna supplanted Brahman in both theodicy and cosmology and became the crown of union in love. This is demonstrated as the commentary proceeds, with recognition of early Saimkhya naturalism and Buddhist asceticism, but growing emphasis upon the personal God, from the first hint of divine love in 4, i i. 'I return their love', to I 2, 7 where we see 'a God of grace who assists the self of man in every stage of his development. This is something quite new in Hinduism.' Zaehner generally renders dtman by 'self' instead of 'soul', stressing the reflexive use of the pronoun as well as its application to individual and universal self. Buddhi is translated as 'soul' rather than 'mind', since it is not only intellect but will and it can be saved or corrupted, whereas the self is beyond the onslaught of the passions. Full attention is given to Buddhist influences, especially in the early chapters of the Glta which contain many Buddhist sentiments, though its growing theism gradually replaces Buddhist thought. This is the answer to Dasgupta's claim that the Gita was pre Buddhist; on the contrary it was perhaps the Hindu answer to Buddhism, as the Lotus Sfitra might be seen as a Buddhist answer to Hindu devotion alism. There are interesting notes which indicate that the Buddhist denial of self was not so absolute in the early days as is often assumed, that nirvdna became acclimatised in Hinduism after the Gita had adopted it from Buddhism, and that the author of the Gita coined that intriguing compound Brahma-nirvana. There are important discussions of many terms, such as adhydtman, often rendered as Essential Self or even Over-Soul, but shown to be an adverb derived from the Upanishads and meaning 'in so far as it appertains to self'. Occasionally there are pointed references: such as to Hell, described by Thomas Merton as 'perpetual alienation from our true being', or to Purusha, Person or Spirit, compared with the Christian God the Father, 'a "Person" if ever there was one'. But these are flashes of insight or wit among the countless notes and elaborate expositions of theology and philosophy which make this book of monumental importance and constant fascination. There could hardly be a greater contrast than that between Zaehner's book and one by A. C. Bhaktivedanta, vainly called The Bhagavad Gita as it is (Collier-Macmillan, gop). Despite forewords by Thomas Merton and the poet Allen Ginsberg, who ineptly quotes the African god Chango, this version is incorrect and monistic and is plainly the Gita as it isn't. The seclusion of All Souls has proved very valuable, and though Professor</page><page sequence="3">INDIAN STUDIES I71 Zaehner only visited India recently for the first time, his works on classical Hinduism are so full of insights that they cannot come under the strictures on 'theology at 70 degrees' made by Fr. K. Klostermaier. His Hindu and Christian in Vrindaban (S.C.M. /I o05) was the second outstanding book in the Indian field in I969, and although slight it is both charming and important. He attacks indirectly those well fed and comfortable theologians who assume God to be happy and rested, and the whole world to be 'a beautiful harmony with a grand purpose'. His own work took hini for two years from Munich to Vrindaban, one of the great centres of the Krishna cult, where 'the theologian at 120 degrees tries to imagine a God who is hungry and thirsty, who suffers and is sad, who sheds perspiration and knows despair'. Vrindaban shows something different also from the lofty Krishna of the Gita, for it is the home of the romantic Krishna-lila, the love-play of Krishna with the Gopis, the milkmaids. Here men and women toil round the sacred sites hungering for prema-bhakti, passionate love for God and union with him as Radha, his paramour. Two million visit Vrindaban every year and it is said to have seven thousand temples. This Roman Catholic priest went in procession to the sanctuaries and shared in worship, listening to accounts of visions of Krishna and noting that he is spoken of as the supreme God and the Bhagavata Purana as the word of God. It was a moving and searching experience and at the end of his account Fr. Klostermaier tackles some of the problems that arose. Christ was clearly not an Avatar, which would have been known already 'if only the mis sionaries did not always consider studies a superfluous waste of time'. Christ was in humanity from the beginning, not merely in a praeparatio evangelica but guiding all hearts still and with many names unknown to us. Knowledge of Christ 'takes place inside Brahmavidya', he does not come to India from Europe or as a stranger, but meets the Hindu within his own thought and faith. Klostermaier's book is much warmer than M. M. Thomas's The Acknowledged Christ of the Indian Renaissance (S.C.M. ?3 I5), but this work is valuable for the handy form in which it records some of the appreciations of Christ made by Hindu reformers from Ram Mohan Roy to Mahatma Gandhi, and Christian comments from J. N. Farqubar to Paul Devanandan. I969 was the five hundredth anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikhs, and there were celebrations in many places, including a meeting at the Albert Hall which was attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In September the University of the Punjab at Patiala held an international seminar, which I attended, and a new centre was dedicated in honour of the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh. This is a great concrete and glass pyramid, of 70 rather than I20 degrees architectural inspiration and terribly hot. It has five wings, or lotus petals, for the study of five religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism. An</page><page sequence="4">172 GEOFFREY PARRINDER exhibition of books in the university library displayed nearly everything written on the Sikhs, but the absent guest or ghost at the feast was the recent study of Gurui Ndnak and the Sikh Religion (Clarendon, I968, J2 .50), by W. H. McLeod, the third of our outstanding books. This London thesis is based on examination of the original Punjabi texts and its careful scholar ship brings the author into the front ranks of students of Indian religion. It is understandable that his work has been difficult for the Sikhs to accept, because its critical approach to sacred story follows the pattern of western higher criticism in dissecting Christian texts and doctrines, and few other religions have even touched on this painful discipline. Dr McLeod under takes a 'quest for the historical Nanak', as he says, and his rigorous scrutiny of traditional biographies 'must yield disappointing results'. His sources are the scriptures, the Adi Granth, and the hagiographic biographies, Janam Sakhis. After critical attack very little remains of material with which to construct a life of the saint, which is sketched in less than a page, with five more on his person, though there is no doubt of his existence and essential role as founder of Sikhism. Perhaps most interesting are the careful analyses of the teachings of Nanak, which are given at some length. Dr McLeod rejects the common notion that Sikhism is a typically Indian blend of Hindu and Muslim beliefs, though his critics say that he has paid insufficient attention to Sfifism. But he gives a valuable sketch of the Hindu background, the monotheism which Nanak inherited from bhakti movements, and the acceptance of the doctrines of Karma and transmigration which directly conflict with Suifism. Nanak believed in the unity of God, a faith which is declared in the Sikh daily prayer, in God as creator, sustainer, destroyer, formless and immanent. The world is mayd, not an illusion but imper manent, and man is called by grace to the divine word and wisdom and to loving devotion. By restricting himself to Guru Nanak, rather than the succeeding Gurfis and later followers, Dr McLeod finds that the founder was a deeply devout believer, who refused to renounce his family and worldly occupation, but became a revered teacher 'giving expression to his experience in simple direct hymns of superb poetic quality'. The Sikhs are noted in India for their energetic attitude to life, and among their feats of organisation in the celebrations at Patiala some of their publications may be noted. To inaugurate the study of the religions five volumes were published in I969 by the Punjabi university press, under the names of each of the religions. They are all worth reading, the Sikh volume containing some critical studies, the Christian volume being by Indian Christians, and the Hindu volume revealing that the head of the religious studies department, in this predominantly Sikh university, was a Hindu. This university press some years ago published A Critical Study of the Adi Granth by S. S. Kohli, and it plans to publish the papers presented at the international seminar. The first of these is already in hand and will</page><page sequence="5">INDIAN STUDIES 173 discuss the philosophy and message of Gurul Nanak, not only from Sikh but also from Hindu, Muslim and Christian points of view. Despite the understandable conservatism of many Sikh leaders, books are being produced which are worthy of consideration by western scholarship. Lately to hand is Visnuism and Sivaism by J. Gonda (Athlone Press, 13 . 50), the Jordan Lectures given at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, in I969. This great Dutch scholar's books on early Visnuism and Indian religions in general are so important that all his writings demand attention. The present work is a classical exposition of Visnu and Siva from the Vedas onwards, with constant attention to the mutual relationships of the two. Visnu is usually considered to play only a small part in the Vedas, but Gonda regards his personality as important and clear-cut, while Siva is foreshadowed by the Vedic Rudra and identified with him in the later Upanishads and afterwards. Multitudes of texts are quoted to illustrate the characters of the two gods and their rise to superiority in the Maha bharata and later, and over seventy pages of notes give many references and fuller exposition. What is remarkable is the complete ignoring in this book of any possible links with the Indus Valley (Harappa) civilisation, so favoured by Marshall and Zimmer with their Proto-Siva and other cults. Gonda is strictly scriptural and makes the strongest possible case, though perhaps not conclusive, for the Vedic and Aryan origins of these deities. The worship and congregations connected with the two gods are called religions rather than 'sects', since there was no established church from which they parted. However there is an 'exclusivism' in each religion and while there is much overlapping there is also a 'passive intolerance' of doctrine which sometimes appears also in practice. Both of them may consign opponents to hell though in practice they tend to regard the other deity as subordinate to their own. Valuable descriptions are given of theology, ritual, folklore and myth, and no student of Indian religions can afford to neglect this meticulous and learned work. Finally, but not least, comes Mariasusai Dhavamony's unique study of the Love of God according to Saiba Siddhdnta (Clarendon, f4 2o). Despite the efforts of the blurb to interest general readers in its 'relevance to con temporary problems of religious pluralism', this is a highly specialised study, expounding Tamil and Sanskrit texts in translation, though also showing the extent of bhakti and the importance of Saivite monotheism. Fr. Dhava mony says rightly that 'the religious significance of the Saiva Siddhanta has been almost entirely neglected', partly due to the modern prevalence of monism and syncretism which despises bhakti religion as emotional and anthropomorphic and as virtually unknown to Upanishadic Brahmanism. He begins with a valuable analysis of the Sanskrit term bhakti, its use in the epics and the Bhagavad-Gita, development in other Sanskrit texts, and</page><page sequence="6">174 GEOFFREY PARRINDER then turns to Saivism and Tamil writings. The probable Indus Valley or Dravidian origins of Siva are acknowledged, but the greater part of the book, sections three and four, is devoted to careful exposition and analysis of Tamil Saivite mystical and theological texts. The leading mystical works are examined, from the Tirumurai to the poems of Manikka Vacakar, and in each case the meaning of bhakti is considered, and the love of God, taken as both man's love to God and God's love for man. Then the fourteen Saiva Siddhanta Sastras are considered in turn, with similar reference and also noting concepts of self, the immanence and transcendence of God, and the nature and higher states of mysticism. No summary can do justice to the great amount of detail, which makes this book indispensable for know ledge of this large part of Hindu religion. At the end Fr. Dhavamony examines the theological presuppositions of bhakti doctrines. Though a Christian priest, he speaks of the Tiruvacakam, the best-known work of Manikka Vacakar, as 'divinely inspired, and undoubtedly ranking as one of the great religious classics of the world'. He says that the Gita understood divine immanence 'correctly', and emphasises that Tamil Saivism rejected and opposed pantheism, indeed Saiva Siddhanta is distinguished from all other Indian philosophies in claiming that the soul is naturally divine 'because it is ever inseparably united with the grace of God'. A great con tribution to understanding devotion and monotheism in India, this book is essential to the study of Hindu religion and theology.</page></plain_text>
