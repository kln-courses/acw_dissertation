<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cenct: Recognizing the Shelleyan Sublime Paul Endo In Prometheus Unbound, Prometheus's "high," sublime language is impli- cated in an ethic of revenge that perpetuates evil until it can be recalled. According to Angela Leighton, Shelley could subscribe to the sublime rheto- ric of enthusiasm, transport, and religious illumination only uneasily and with caution: the "Shelleyan sublime/' she argues, is distinguished by "its unbelief, and its recognition . . . that what the human imagination confronts in its creative aspiration may be only a vacancy."1 Shelley's engagement with the sublime, in other words, was a troubled one: while he does not reject the sublime altogether, there is throughout his work a consistent op- position to the sublime in its "high" or didactic, ideological forms. If the sublime involves an initial moment of incomprehension, an incomprehen- sion that is then superseded, assimilated, and transmuted into knowledge, then Shelley rearticulates this sublime logic, reconfiguring it into what might be called his presublime and negative sublime modes. Notable in Shelley is a daemonic state in which the subject, as though possessed, is suspended in an incomprehension too formidable to yield to comprehension and knowledge. The sublime event is not allowed to fully "mature" into mean- ing; instead, it is arrested at a presublime stage. While this presublime is often symptomatic of an incapacity, of an epistemological crisis that is also a crisis of agency, the negative sublime actively challenges the high sub- lime and its generation of a "finished" meaning. If the emplotting of the sublime - of its movement out of the meaningless into meaning - is neces- sarily ideological, the negative sublime suspends the crystallization into hard, dogmatic meaning through an "awful doubt" that respects all that must be excluded. The negative sublime is less an outright repudiation of the sub- lime, then, than an attempt to isolate and mine its critical potential, that moment when comprehension, still emerging from incomprehension, re- tains its own negativity. Shelley's presublime or daemonic style describes a course of asymp- totic deferral in which the subject can never quite comprehend its object.2 In The Cenci, the inability to mediate (both linguistically and legally) conspires to Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 38, No. 3/4, Fall/Winter 1996 © 1996 by the University of Texas Press, P.O.

In this state of immediacy, everything is in fact too close; Beatrice's inability to mediate, to name her rape is here representative. This incomprehension has moral consequences: Beatrice's retaliation - that is, her ultimate failure to act other than in kind - serves to repeat preexisting patriarchal values. The unequivocal condemnation of Beatrice's "pernicious mistakes," however, would commit Shelley to the very dogmatism he ab- jures in his Preface and contests in the high sublime. He is careful to render Beatrice resistant to easy denunciation: "It is in the restless and anatomiz- ing casuistry with which men seek the justification of Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs justification . . . that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered, consists."3 Instead of proselytizing, he recom- mends - in the negative sublime spirit of a teaching without teaching - "self-knowledge." Through this shift out of the presublime into the nega- tive sublime, Shelley is able to reject an incomprehension complicit with revenge without risking a stance equally guilty of dogmatism. He invites the reader-audience to free itself from the spell of Beatrice's revenge and, by securing that space from which it can engage the play critically, enact its own self-knowledge. Shelley's Science of Mind and the Daemonic Presublime Shelley's science of mind, as Timothy Clark has maintained, proposed the minute analysis of what Wordsworth called the mind's fluxes and refluxes.4 Shelley's ambitions included drafting an exhaustive catalogue of mental phenomena: A scale might be formed, graduated according to the degrees of a com- bined ratio of intensity, duration, connexion, periods of recurrence, and utility, which would be the standard, according to which all ideas might be measured, and an uninterrupted chain of nicely shadowed distinctions would be observed, from the faintest impression on the senses, to the most distinct combination of those impressions; from the simplest of those combinations, to that mass of knowledge which, including our own nature, constitutes what we call the universe.5 In his Preface to The Cenci, Shelley seems committed to pursuing these re- searches: "Such a story, if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it, their hopes and fears, their confidences and misgivings, their various interests, passions and opinions acting upon and with each other, yet all conspiring to one tremendous end, would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart" (PP 239). Shelley, like many of his contemporaries, sought to discover through such investigations a secret map to the "caverns" of the</page><page sequence="3">The Cenci and the Sublime 381 mind;6 in Julian and Maddalo, Julian's remedy for the maniac involves just this course of study: I imagined that if day by day I watched him, and but seldom went away, And studied all the beatings of his heart With zeal, as men study some stubborn art For their own good, and could by patience find An entrance to the caverns of his mind, I might reclaim him from his dark estate . . . (PP 126) Although motivated, according to Clark, by an optimistic faith that "the mind should be its own magistrate and legislator" (24), Shelley's sci- ence of mind was disabled from the outset by an inability to separate the mind's voluntary from its involuntary powers. Despite its enlightenment aspirations, his science of mind effectively diffused the subject into its per- ceptions and ideas. In "Speculations on Metaphysics," Shelley maintains that what are "called real, or external objects" differ from "hallucinations, dreams, and the ideas of madness" only in "force" (CW VII, 59-60). The subject is deprived of both a means to self-transcendence (there are no longer accessible external objects of knowledge) and a fixed perspective from which to stabilize its own field of experience. "Thought can with difficulty visit the intricate and winding chambers which it inhabits," he explains. "It is like a river whose rapid and perpetual stream flows outwards; - like one in dread who speeds through the recesses of some haunted pile, and dares not look behind" (CW VII, 64). The self is no longer the equivalent of a stable identity; it is possessed by some internal demon driving it helplessly on. Like the imagination in Kant's mathematical sublime, struggling to process a magnitude it cannot comprehend,7 the self finds the purchase necessary for comprehension sliding out from beneath it. Shelley's famil- iar image of the river8 wending through hidden caverns replays this self- pursuing nature of thought: the river symbolized, like his transformation of the Actaeon myth,9 the mind's passivity before its own uncontrollable force. There is a revision of traditional priorities: a centered subject no longer acts and thinks from some stable ground, but is instead condemned to chas- ing after itself. In The Cenci, then, the science of mind proposed in the Pref- ace is corrupted into a daemonic "self-anatomy" that leads to self- deception and casuistry.10 Probing the caverns of the mind leads not to enlightenment but to a Machiavellian will to manipulate. As the prelate Orsino notes: 'tis a trick of this same family To analyse their own and other minds. Such self-anatomy shall teach the will</page><page sequence="4">382 Paul Endo Dangerous secrets: for it tempts our powers, Knowing what must be thought, and may be done, Into the depth of darkest purposes . . . (II.ii.108- 113) This daemonic and gothic turn is not incidental to The Cenci. Shelley's affinity for the gothic is a psychological one;11 the presence of the gothic always extends beyond its conventional furniture (castles, incestuous rapes, tortures, intrigues). Shelley's temperament rendered him susceptible to heightened psychic states, to imaginings so evocative that they rose up before him with a terrifying clarity. Mind and reality collapse into each other, and visions almost literally materialize.12 Gothic metaphors of hallu- cination, madness, and contamination are especially amenable to Shelley's daemonic metaphysics. Shelley, as Richard Holmes has detailed, was vul- nerable to an "'aweful' hypersensitivity to the phenomenon of the natural universe."13 His engagement with the gothic, not surprisingly, involves a radical reformulation of its subject-object presuppositions: Shelley relocates the gothic onto a largely intrasubjective stage. David Seed detects this shift in his early juvenile novels: "Even at his most sensational he seems more interested in the workings of the mind than in simply evoking horror. In that respect Shelley's romances take their place within a broader shift in taste which was taking place within the Gothic mode away from clichéd settings like ruined castles to internalized landscapes which focus atten- tion on the mind."14 In the Shelleyan gothic, contends Kim Ian Michasiw, no moment of Radcliffean enlightenment is possible; there is no longer room for a subject able, through the Cartesian "light of reason," to demystify the terrifying shadows cast by ignorance.15 The sources of gothic terror and the daemonic do not originate outside the subject, but emerge from within as a kind of epiphenomenon, an effect projected by a self-divided mind never quite able to attain self-knowledge. In the daemonic presublime, there is an incapacity to move "outside," to negotiate a fixed position. In The Cenci, this incapacity is especially overdetermined. As a revenge tragedy, the lack of an acceptable, indepen- dent judge or mediator is part of The Cenci' s generic inheritance. Violence is answered by violence in a ceaseless attempt to "catch up" to justice. As Beatrice warns her father: "ill must come of ill" (I.iii.151).16 As a gothic revenge tragedy, a work that obscures the boundaries between real and fantastic, legal and illegal, The Cenci seems generically predisposed to the daemonic presublime: there are few formal limitations to mediate and dis- cipline a subjectivity so harried that it proves unable to gain a perspective outside its own immediate momentum. Language, Mediation, Recognition Shelley's theory of language is perhaps best described as phenomenologi-</page><page sequence="5">The Cenci and the Sublime 383 cal; it is concerned with neither the conventional agreement of signifier and signified nor with the mystical cocreativity of word and being, but with the differential force of a "vitally metaphorical" language that announces: Their [the poets'] language is vitally metaphorical; that is, it marks the before unapprehended relations of things, and perpetuates their ap- prehension, until the words which represent them, become through time signs for portions or classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then if no new poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been thus disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse. (PP 482) Shelley accords metaphor a world-disclosive and emancipatory effect: it has the power to dissolve those associations that have grown fixed and corrupted. As a revenge tragedy, however, The Cenci requires more than a private, aesthetic language of revelation: because issues of justice - of me- diation and legal agreement - are preeminent, language must acquire an intersubjective or communicative function. For Shelley, poetic language is already political;17 the act of apprehending the before unapprehended sus- pends the reification of language - a reification that is institutional as well as linguistic - into "signs for portions or classes of thoughts." Fallen lan- guage, like Nietzsche's coins that have lost their embossing, communicate through habit and unthinking repetition. For Shelley, these reified "signs" do not hinder exchange but paradoxically "improve" it; insofar as commu- nication is optimized by the unimpeded flow of information, fallen lan- guage constitutes an ideal: it is a virtually transparent medium. Words as- sume an immediacy by default. The more readily language thus withdraws into the background, neutralizing dissent and critical dialogue, the less capable it is of realizing its mediating potential, its apophantic ability to be seen. Beatrice must therefore raise herself out of the immediacy of her ven- geance and think anew the patriarchal principles of "gold, opinion, law and power" (III.i.185) that constitute the play's unapprehended backdrop. It is because of this mediating power, this capacity to make appear and be apprehended, that metaphor can function as an instrument for personal and social change, for engaging the critical capacities of both oneself and of others. Theories of language committed to the priority of immediacy over mediation fail to acknowledge this need for language to circulate and pro- voke thought. Gerald L. Bruns has spoken of Shelley's "Orphic" language: for the Orphic poet the word, by shaping and predetermining perception, predicates reality itself. Orphic language, Bruns explains, is named "after Orpheus, the primordial singer whose sphere of activity is governed by a mythical or ideal unity of word and being, and whose power extends there- fore beyond the formation of a work toward the creation of the world."18</page><page sequence="6">384 Paul Endo "Word" and "being" disappear into an "ideal unity." Lost is something that might be called the gestalt of language: its ability to differ meaning- fully from itself, to announce itself by creating its own ground - to range between mediation and immediacy, apprehension and the unapprehended. Jerrold E. Hogle's deconstructive reading of Shelley, while hostile to any "ideal unity of word and being," overcompensates by universalizing the status of writing and mediation: "Writing itself is an essential part of the 'motion' that 'produces mind' for Shelley, to such an extent that mind and 'Spirit' are the creations of language in his view quite as much as language is an extension of them."19 For Hogle, the distinction between mediation and the unmediated may seem no longer pertinent, but it returns in his privileging of "radical" over "regressive" transferences, that is, of freely circulating transferences over transferences that have thickened into form. Hogle's radicalizing of writing into a generalized transference simply in- verts the logocentric priority of center over difference, effectively valoriz- ing the decentered as the unmediated. Like Bruns's Orphic account, Hogle's project shares the same bias towards the unmediated, an immediacy that reappears as a polymorphous vitalism (recalling, in fact, Lebensphilosophie) that elides the range of ways in which Shelley's language actually "works."20 The need for mediation is in The Cenci an overdetermined one; it is social and linguistic, to be sure, but also psychological. According to the psychodynamics of the revenge tragedy, consolation can proceed only by displacing or rerouting one's grievance or loss away from revenge and entrusting it to some public court of appeal. Crucial to the process of mourn- ing and consolation, Peter M. Sacks explains, "is the renunciatory experi- ence of loss and the acceptance, not just of a substitute, but of the very means and practice of substitution."21 As a victim seeking consolation and justice, Beatrice must forge a mediating language: she must concede that there is an outside, something beyond the self that can be retained and engaged only through substitutes and proxies. Only then can Beatrice move beyond the immediate, daemonic pursuit of private restitution and enter into intra- and intersubjective dialogue. This is the paradox of mediation: informed, critical communication is possible only through intervention, by letting something between. Only through mediation can The Cenci's public, legal concerns be addressed.22 In Act I, after the Count announces the deaths of his sons, Beatrice petitions the "noble guests" for aid. Although other, ineffectual appeals are made on her behalf - by Camillo and Bernardo - Beatrice undertakes only this one attempt at mediation; even after the rape, she refrains from legal suit. "Accuse him of the deed," counsels Orsino, "and let the law / Avenge thee" (III.i.152- 53). But the deed, she responds, is both unutterable and an offense to her "unpolluted fame" (III.i.158). She is silenced by a discourse that virtually excludes her and the "strange horror" of the inces- tuous rape from the outset:</page><page sequence="7">The Cenci and the Sublime 385 If I could find a word that might make known The crime of my destroyer . . . Think of the offender's gold, his dreaded hate, And the strange horror of the accuser's tale, Baffling belief, and overpowering speech . . . (III.i.154-55, 162-64) All authority redounds upon the father. As patriarch of the Cencis, the Count is a "shadow" of the pope and God, the holy and heavenly fathers. He has managed to escape punishment insofar as his actions and words have the implicit sanction, albeit grudgingly conceded and purchased at consider- able cost, of the Catholic patriarchy. This is why Shelley can call religion "a passion, a persuasion, an excuse, a refuge; never a check" (PP 241). There is in The Cenci a predilection for hortatory utterances - for curses, countercurses, threats. Such performative statements do not create Orphic unities of word and being; they instead operate by citing and activating a preexisting "text" that is already regarded as authoritative.23 Thus the con- servative nature of performatives: insofar as their efficacy depends upon shared background assumptions, upon a silent, buried consent, they per- petuate the status quo. Through repeated citation - but only by the autho- rized - performatives reinforce their own right to bestow meaning while neutralizing unauthorized, alternative practices. Curses extend and sup- port patriarchal power, for instance, wielding an influence reaching even into death; it is rumored that "a father's curses, as men say, / Climb with swift wings after their children's souls, / And drag them from the very throne of Heaven" (I.iii.84-86). The Count's curses seek to draw Beatrice into his corruption, to reduce her to property. As Michasiw writes, the Count "insists that he, as their author, may write upon their [the Cenci children's] most essential being and that he will engrave thereon his name" (205). Af- ter the rape, Beatrice struggles to reclaim her name and shelter it from the Count, but what Bourdieu calls the "symbolic power" of language - a power no less real for being symbolic - is securely on the Count's side: his lan- guage has authority insofar as his legitimacy as speaker has already been delegated.24 Only the appropriate person, the one who can speak properly and with propriety, is entitled to speak and, more importantly, to be heard. The conflict between Beatrice and her father can in this sense be described as a nominal one; she struggles to counter the Count's claim on her name, place, and memories: Is it my crime That one with white hair, and imperious brow, Who tortured me from my forgotten years, As parents only dare, should call himself My father, yet should be! - Oh, what am I?</page><page sequence="8">386 Paul Endo What name, what place, what memory shall be mine? What retrospects, outliving even despair? (III.i.70-76) As her earlier concern with "unpolluted fame" suggests, Beatrice is not redefining herself according to some new, oppositional order; her appeals remain committed to patriarchal values - to God, name, and reputation. Beatrice's pursuit of justice is complicit with the very naturalization of the proper and property that has lent the patriarchy its enduring power. She stays within the discourse of power, unable to mediate her way free, to apprehend before unapprehended alternatives. Even while awaiting ex- ecution in the final act, she clings to the Cenci name and, acting now as patriarch, bequeaths it to her brother Bernardo in a dark ceremony of suc- cession: And though 111 tongues shall wound me, and our common name Be as a mark stamped on thine innocent brow For men to point at as they pass, do thou Forbear, and never think a thought unkind Of those, who perhaps love thee in their graves. (V.iv.149-54) For Prometheus, who endows Jupiter with all he has, the renunciation of revenge suffices to dissolve the old order. But Beatrice is not Prometheus: the world is not a product of her "fore-thought," of her institutionalized attitudes. As a truly Orphic figure, Prometheus embodies change; there is no need to insert himself into a preexisting discursive field. In The Cenci, however, reform must be prepared beforehand. Conviction and acceptance are not won through the simple force of argument; language, insinuating its way into and between established metaphors, must liberate already existing possibilities. Attempting to deceive the Count into repentance, Lucretia imputes to Beatrice "divine revealings" threatening "to punish his enormous crimes." Because divine, these revealings cite the Count's own source of power, and he is temporarily checked: Why - such things are . . . No doubt divine revealings may be made. 'Tis plain I have been favoured from above, For when I cursed my sons they died. (IV.i.37-40) But when Lucretia admits her "feint," she is accused of "palter[ing] with the sacred truth of God" (IV.i.73). Unnatural and inappropriate, the feint challenges the very legality of language. The name underwrites all prop- erty and guarantees legitimacy: during one of his curses, the Count in-</page><page sequence="9">The Cenci and the Sublime 387 vokes "the name of God" (IV.i.128). Beatrice too, even while disowning the incriminating knife, concedes the authority of the proper name: do you think I should have left this two edged instrument Of my misdeed; this man, this bloody knife With my own name engraven on the heft . . .? (V.ii.96-99) Beatrice's actions are guided by a parasitical attitude to patriarchy: because she accepts its fundamental principles, her opposition must limit itself to negation or denial. When she implores Bernardo to "never think a thought un-kind" of his family, she continues to think of the family and propriety as values sanctioned by nature. "What the tragic discourse of Beatrice's world excludes," writes Ronald Tetreault, "is any alternative to the prevailing ideology of patriarchal power."25 Under such conditions, revenge may seem an inevitable, even excusable course. But there is no such thing as a monolithic discourse, a discourse without the many sites - the ruptures, fault lines, and internal contradictions - where power is regularly contested. There is always space for heterogeneity and the oppositional; it is precisely such a subdiscourse that Beatrice must activate or cite to initiate the process of mediation. And yet it would be unfair to hold Beatrice responsible for her failure to do so: she cannot be regarded as a wholly autonomous agent. Indeed, it is her identity itself that is threatened by the rape ("I am mad beyond all doubt!" [III.i.25]), an identity already delimited by patriarchal constraints. Shelley's faith in noble, patient forbearance before immeasurable wrongs is here surely misplaced. His insistence that "no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another" (PP 240) does indeed, as Michasiw contends, sub- scribe to "the Romantic ideal of an entirely autonomous self, a self which may rise above history and circumstance sovereignly regardless of the blows of outrageous, or even mundane, fortune" (206). This positive surplus of the self generates not self-knowledge, but a kind of self-apotheosis that abrogates any need for others. In the revenge tragedy, where the consola- tion of intersubjective recognition (in a word, justice) is psychologically crucial, this "autonomous self" approaches, in its utter refusal to displace loss, the intransitive, self-enclosed state Freud calls "melancholia."26 If romanticism's autonomous self is too self-knowing, Beatrice is not self-knowing enough. In the final act, she manages to occupy the patriar- chal discourse and manipulate it from within; she mobilizes its idealiza- tion of purity to convince Marzio of her innocence. Her defense, appealing to a "holy and unstained" self-image, commits her to dissimulation. She exploits the logic of the name to her own advantage, and does so in a vein just as "sly" and "equivocating" as Qrsino's. Indeed, her tactics are suggestive: a</page><page sequence="10">388 Paul Endo promising response to ideology is to master its logic, turning it against itself and worrying its internal contradictions from within. But Beatrice's actions are without self-knowledge or a sense of even limited strategic en- gagement; convinced by her own rhetoric of innocence, she is unable to release the subversive possibilities of her position, to exploit the displace- ment she effects within the patriarchal simply by assuming an authorized position. According to Thomas Weiskel, this refusal to substitute and mediate - that is, to accept negativity - suffices to classify Shelley a poet of the "posi- tive" sublime.27 Shelley betrays a desire so tenacious, Weiskel contends, that he refuses to deny or to sublimate (156-57). This is of course a one- sided reading: Shelley's daemonic presublime (Weiskel's "positive" sub- lime) exists alongside a negative sublime that not only reins in his "tenac- ity of desire," but does so when the status of this desire as desire passes virtually unrecognized by others. This is not to deny the strong narcissistic element in Shelley; it is necessary to insist, however, that this element rarely presents itself in a manner allowing access to Shelley "himself," to a Shelley unmediated by the aesthetic. In The Cenci, the daemonic seems to approach the incapacitating and pathological; but a more attentive reading will sug- gest that it is being re-presented as an already mediated moment, staged as a negative lesson within a more comprehensive drama. Naming, the Nameless, and the Negative Sublime For Stuart Peterfreund, the tragedy of Beatrice can be "read as a symbolic one consummated by Beatrice's adoption of the métonymie language of reif ication and self-empowerment spoken by her patriarchal society in gen- eral and by her father Count Cenci in particular."28 Peterfreund, collapsing ethical into tropological categories, equates metaphor with "dissolution into the universe or absorption of it" and metonymy with "occlusion and reification" (190). In an equally suggestive article, Michael Worton advances a similar thesis, identifying in the play a preference for nonverbal language: "Beatrice . . . must not permit the 'formless horror' of her thoughts to be structured: only if they remain semi-conscious and incoherent can she re- tain her sanity."29 For Worton and Peterfreund, language is responsible for actualizing evil; to return to a prelinguistic realm, therefore, is to recover a paradise of unrepressed potentiality. Like Hogle's preference for "radical transference," this valorization of "absorption" and the "nonverbal" be- longs to romantic ideology and its fascination with imagery of organicism, spontaneity, and dynamism. The unmediated seems to emit a Utopian charge, but it should be noted that "absorption," as a type of unprocessed experience, constitutes the utter diffusion of the critical subject - that is, madness. The Cenci' s gothic metaphors of hallucination (the formless hor-</page><page sequence="11">The Cena and the Sublime 389 rors, the self-created shadows) and Beatrice's daemonic participation in the Count's ethic of violence are, after all, simply figures for absorption, for that presublime inability to differentiate and discriminate. Metaphor does not belong, as Peterfreund argues, on the side of im- mediacy and absorption; it rather lifts one out of immediacy by allowing something to be disclosed and apprehended. The reformative power of metaphor is found not in its transparency, its impulse toward absorption, but in the critical potential of its (in itself neutral) differentiating effect. Metaphor, as the vehicle for apprehending the before unapprehended, en- ables one to "lever" oneself out of immediacy. This is why Beatrice's in- ability to name the Count's abuse must be accorded such a crucial role: it precludes any possibility of self-knowledge and justice. "Words and im- ages," as Jean Hall writes, "are simultaneously public and private: they tell stories to the world, but they also clarify one's inner experience."30 There is no mediated self to engage her critically. This distrust of mediation and language is entirely consistent, as Sacks has argued, with the ethos of the revenge tragedy (68). But so long as the traumatic rape remains unnamed and her misery "without a name" (III.i.116), they are foreclosed to con- sciousness and cannot be worked through. Without a name, the rape is inaccessible to "cure." It cannot be introduced into a discursive order, re- lated to an origin or cause outside itself. As Lucretia diagnoses: "Her spirit apprehends the sense of pain, / But not its cause; suffering has dried away / The source from which it sprung" (III.i.34- 36). The task of the revenge tragedy and the elegy is to reestablish the faith in mediation. For the revenger, Sacks explains, "with his language itself tending toward the im- possible and self-defeating condition of privacy, the issue of his madness would be close at hand" (68). Mediation may be susceptible to semantic entropy and reification, but it is only by naming, by what might be called "mediating-free," that Beatrice can distance herself from her will to revenge and, confronted with her condition, potentially redress it. With the "nameless," the "unimaginable," the "expressionless," we are trenching upon the terrain of the sublime and the breakdown of language before the incommensurable. To conflate the sublime with an undifferenti- ated oceanic absorption, however, is to forfeit its critical potential.31 The nameless constitutes only a presublime: as a state of incomprehension, it recalls the first, preliminary stage in Kant's mathematical sublime, in which the imagination finds itself occupied without end, possessed by a magni- tude it cannot aesthetically comprehend. But the sublime requires a fur- ther act of mediation: an unmediated surplus or excess is encountered that can be comprehended only through substitution, through a sign that stands for this excess. Because this substitute is in danger of displacing its refer- ent, Shelley's negative sublime attempts to isolate the moment of becom- ing-sublime, to preserve that critical period before comprehension effaces</page><page sequence="12">390 Paul Endo its own source in an enabling act of mediation. Beatrice's inability to name is an overdetermined one; it cannot be of- fered as direct evidence of Shelley's failure to sublimate or displace. Con- tributing to her inability is Shelley's decision not to name (as a concession to public sensibilities),32 but perhaps more important is his promotion of "indefiniteness" as a tactic for warding off reification. "Where indefinite- ness ends," he writes in a discussion of the "universal Being," "idolatry and anthropomorphism begin" (CW VI, 232). Shelley formulates here a namelessness that is dissociated from immediacy and "absorption," that deliberately abstains from naming - a namelessness, in other words, no longer belonging to a pathological "tenacity of desire." And, indeed, it is important to note two strains of namelessness in Shelley: one associated with the presublime, the other with the negative sublime. The provenance of the first is an inability to name or mediate; in Alastor, for instance, there is the Poet who self-destructively and without check pursues the "prototype of his conception." The second, more cautious namelessness, seeking to escape the perils of "idolatry and anthropomorphism," chooses to name negatively, in the underworld interview in Prometheus Unbound, Demogorgon insists that the "deep truth" is "imageless" - not out of inca- pacity, but out of a second-order recognition of its ineffability, a refusal to fill it with meaning.33 Shelley's negative sublime is a response to the naturalization of sub- lime meaning as truth - a naturalization that seems almost irresistible in- sofar as it coincides with the very emergence of meaning out of incompre- hension. This sublime passage into meaning is therefore especially amenable to imagery of origination - of revelation, conversion, rebirth. Although the sublime, by repudiating the past, harbors genuine emancipatory possibili- ties, these possibilities always court ideology. Indeed, the originary mo- ment is by nature exclusionary: it involves a birth into one thing and not another. The sublime does not describe representation's outer limit, the thinning away of the human and the ideological, but the very site of repre- sentation - the appearance of meaning. Preface to the Sublime The absence of the high sublime in The Cenci is entirely consistent with Shelley's poetico-moral program. In The Cenci, he is especially careful about banishing moral didacticism: "There must ... be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose" (PP 240). For Shelley, the "weak attempt to teach certain doctrines, which the writer considers as moral truths . . ." (PP 491), is responsible for the historical decline of drama. The renunciation of a "moral purpose" is there- fore inseparable from the muting of the personal for a more documentary</page><page sequence="13">The Cenci and the Sublime 391 stance: "I lay aside the presumptuous attitude of an instructor, and am content to paint, with such colours as my own heart furnishes, that which has been" (PP 237). The Cenci' s antipathy to didacticism of course recalls Shelley's "abhor- rence" of didactic poetry in the Preface to Prometheus Unbound'. "My pur- pose has hitherto been simply to familiarize the highly refined imagina- tion of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence; aware that until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the harvest of his happiness" (PP 135).34 In A Defence of Poetry, Shelley describes this process as a kind of moral- imaginative training: "Poetry enlarges the circumference of the imagina- tion by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new delight. . . . Poetry strengthens that faculty which is the organ of the moral nature of man, in the same manner as exercise strengthens a limb" (PP 488). But in The Cenci, Shelley omits these "thoughts of ever new delight" and "beautiful ideal- isms of moral excellence." If Prometheus's renunciation of retaliation con- stitutes a beautiful idealism, then Beatrice can boast no analogous moment. Shelley offers the play not as an example or exercise but as a negative exemplum: he is hopeful that his audience's "moral nature" has already been sufficiently exercised and enlarged to receive the play's lessons. As- piring to popular success, Shelley treats his audience much more respect- fully than he regards the "select classes of poetical readers" of Prometheus Unbound. It is in this sense, as P. M. S. Dawson writes, that the Preface to The Cenci constitutes "a distinct advance on the Preface to Prometheus Un- bound," and is "rather successful in avoiding didacticism."35 "Revenge, retaliation, atonement, are pernicious mistakes," Shelley writes. "If Beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better; but she would never have been a tragic character" (PP 240). Following Aristotle, Shelley stresses the "pernicious mistakes"36 of the tragic character. Shelley's classical learning was considerable, and A Defence of Poetry demonstrates a thorough familiarity with Aristotle's Poetics: his omission of an Aristotelian recognition scene, of "a change from ignorance to knowledge"37 - that is, self-knowledge - is therefore especially conspicu- ous. It is as if Shelley assumes that the tragic character (despite the ex- ample of Oedipus) is by definition incapable of noting his or her "perni- cious mistakes." This deviation from Aristotle is, however, consonant with the avoidance of "beautiful idealisms"; the presentation of Beatrice's self- reform, by diminishing the interpretive contribution of the reader- audience, would venture too close to didacticism. For those unfamiliar with Shelleyan ethics, then, the Preface plays an indispensable role in cueing expectations. It does not matter that the Pref-</page><page sequence="14">392 Paul Endo ace precedes the play, that daemonic vengeance is criticized and compre- hended in advance; the sublime does not unfold according to a discrete, linear chronology in which incomprehension suddenly yields to compre- hension. In Kant's mathematical sublime, the imagination flounders be- fore an indefinite magnitude. Because of the imagination's incapacity, Kant explains, the "mind . . . hearkens ... to the voice of reason" (102). Although reason appears as if from above, like a kind of deus ex machina, comprehen- sion has been "present" all along, lurking offstage. The sublime has always suggested the apocalyptic: the unmediated encounter with a raw "datum" - be it natural or divine - that cuts through the mundane filters that process our everyday experiences. But the sublime effect is in fact framed, staged by an orchestrating "mind." Burke's description of the sublime includes similar specifications: "if the pain is not carried to violence, and the terror is not conversant about the present destruction of the person, as these emo- tions clear the parts, whether fine, or gross, of a dangerous and trouble- some incumbrance, they are capable of producing delight."38 As Frances Ferguson comments: "one, in other words, enjoys danger only from a posi- tion of safety."39 There is always invariably a proviso, an "if"; the sublime depends upon a judicious positioning, the precise measuring out of terror and safety: it must not be too sublime, too terrifying. Sublime self-knowledge requires a perspectivai shift from participa- tion to observation, inside to outside - a shift prearranged and calculated by a superintending mind. But if Beatrice is unable to become her own spectator, this is not to suggest that self-knowledge is wholly absent. Shelley externalizes the sublime's intrasubjective drama between actor and specta- tor: he takes its theatrical metaphors literally. In The Cenci, the spectator position is moved outside the play: recognition must be performed by the reader-audience. Like Kant's "mind," Shelley stages the sublime, distrib- uting it among a number of different "players." The reactions of the reader- audience are factored into the economy of the play; their inclusion is nec- essary to complete the sublime circuit. "The moral burden of interpretation," explains Wasserman, "which results in our self-knowledge, is thrust on us as readers or spectators" (118). As Shelley specifies in the Preface, the audi- ence must learn to know itself: "The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of itself" (PP 240). This "knowl- edge of itself" is not to be confused with a Cartesian ideal in which the subject exhausts itself as an object of knowledge; the negative sublime, which holds onto the outside as outside, is designed to counter such pre- tensions. Because the sublime must be enacted, it exists for only the dura- tion of this enactment. Self-knowledge is not therefore present "in" the play as a dogmatic truth subject to "idolatry and anthropomorphism." Shelley's political hopes counted heavily on the efficacy of self-</page><page sequence="15">The Cenci and the Sublime 393 knowledge and the corrective power of shame. In 'The Mask of Anarchy/' tyrants and soldiers are checked by self-penitence: faced by the resolute, nonviolent courage of the people, they "will return with shame / To the place from which they came" (PP 310).40 Although Shelley ranked the imagi- nation over reason in A Defence of Poetry, and accorded the imagination moral as well as aesthetic responsibilities,41 his "sympathetic" imagination is closer to what might be called a "therapeutic" mode of reason, a proto- Freudian faith in the curative powers of recognition.42 Shelley explains in a discussion of Greek tragedy: "In a drama of the highest order there is little food for censure or hatred; it teaches rather self-knowledge and self-re- spect. Neither the eye nor the mind can see itself, unless reflected upon that which it resembles" (PP 491). Specular mediation reintroduces the sub- ject to itself through an act of distancing. "Self-knowledge arises from a position of simultaneous identification and distance," comments Hall, "a vantage point provided by dramatic transactions" (340). But as The Cenci makes clear, Shelley was aware that self-distancing does not in itself suf- fice to guarantee recognition and self-knowledge. Reflection is always in danger of degenerating into "self-anatomy," into the daemonic pursuit of one's idealized self-image. Although Shelley can be accused of minimizing the impediments to a public, political mobilization of self-knowledge, like Freud he certainly cannot be charged with overestimating the resistances to self-knowledge itself. There is an element in Shelley predisposed - by temperament, aesthetic design, intellectual integrity - to a state of daemonic deferral, a presublime that resists mediation and the distancing critical to communication. This element is by no means easy to identify: Shelley often stages silence, choos- ing not to mediate. The namelessness of The Cenci is just such an instance: it is not symptomatic of a daemonic, pathological "incapacity," but must be regarded as a calculated attempt, in the spirit of "Mont Blanc," to postpone naming and the propagation of a high sublime meaning or "moral pur- pose." In "Mont Blanc," Shelley's refusal to name the mountain defies con- ventional ideological appropriations of nature's sublimity.43 In The Cenci, Shelley's moralizing is similarly minimized; judgments are withheld and reserved for the audience. By re-presenting the daemonic as a negative lesson, a lesson won through the participation of the reader-audience, Shelley democratizes the high sublime, depriving it of its dogmatism and instilling it with the self-critical vigilance of his negative sublime.</page><page sequence="16">394 Paul Endo NOTES 1.

What is here called Shelley's "daemonic" mode has, of course, been a favorite target of his detractors: they diagnose it as a weak grasp on reality, a "softness" and "effeminacy" of thought that is incapable of adapting to hard distinctions and re- alities. Thomas Jefferson Hogg writes in his memoirs: "He could not support him- self; he must be tied up fast to something of a firmer texture, harder and more rigid than his own, pliant, yielding structure; to some person of less flexible formation; he always required a prop" (quoted in Timothy Webb, Shelley: A Voice Not Under- stood [Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1977], 8). See Webb, chapter 1, for a thorough account of the Shelley myth. For a stylistic reading of Shelley's "speed," uninflected by gendered psycho- pathological prejudices, see William Keach, Shelley's Style (New York: Methuen, 1984), 154-83. "Shelley's speed," he argues, "might best be thought of ... as the formal verbalized articulation, produced by careful observation and deliberate com- positional adjustment, of a mind working rapidly and fluctuantly in a world con- stituted in part through that mind's own perceptual activity" (159). 3.

Discussing the composition of Caleb Williams, William Godwin describes his interest in "the private and internal operations of the mind, employing my meta- physical dissecting knife in tracing and laying bare the involutions of motive, and recording the gradually accumulating impulses, which led the personages I had to describe primarily to adopt the particular way of proceeding in which they after- wards embarked" (quoted in William Godwin, Caleb Williams, ed. David McCracken [London: Oxford UP, 1970], 339). According to Clark: "Advocates of some sort of science of human nature were numerous in this period. . . . The notion of a science of mind analogous in method and certainty to the natural sciences had been a fa- miliar one since the work of John Locke at the end of the seventeenth century" (15). 7.

The difference is merely nominal between those two classes of thought which are vulgarly distinguished by the names of ideas and of external objects" (PP 477).

In the fragment "Satire on Satire," Shelley accuses satire of the same self- perpetuating violence. 17. The poet-legislator reconciles the private with the public. The mechanics of this shift, in which the personal somehow duplicates itself socially, are never elabo- rated. In A Defence of Poetry, Shelley ascribes the correspondence between poetic and social cycles to a Humean "constant conjunction" (PP 489). 18. Gerald L.

The play's recent commentators fail to recognize that immediacy is by defi- nition incapable of serving as a medium for contact. Because mediation suggests a veiling and dissimulating of the true, the unmediated is uncritically coded as emancipatory. Hogle's position is here representative; because of his claim to "de- throne the center-at-one-with-itself from the position of impetus in Shelley's work and replace it with [a] centerless displacement of figurai counterparts by one an- other" (10), he is incapable of thinking of mediation as anything other than a "re- pressed" or "reversed" transference - that is, as a harnessing or "objectification" of transferences that lends them a false substantiality. By leveling everything down to a generalized decentering, Hogle struggles to retrieve an intersubjective or norma- tive element. Any stabilizing of his radical transferences - a stability necessary to explain social groups and, in fact, anything that endures - is condemned as regres- sive and tyrannical.</page><page sequence="18">396 Paul Endo 23.

I would maintain however that Beatrice's inability to name is not, as Hall suggests, a simple matter of personal choice: "Beatrice tries to cope with evil by refusing to recognize it, denying it a word and an image," "By refusing to recognize evil, she hopes to deny its existence" (344, 342; my italics). 31. Among recent commentators, Jean-François Lyotard's contributions are no- table for highlighting the critical potential of the sublime. Lyotard identifies the sublime with the avant-garde project of contesting convention and disarming thought. See, for instance, "The Sublime and the Avant-Garde," in The Inhuman: Reflections on Time, trans. Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1991), 90-91. 32. See Shelley's July [c. 20] 1819 letter to Peacock: "My principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated wd. be admitted on the stage - I think however it will form no objection, considering first that the facts are matter of history, &amp; secondly the peculiar delicacy with which I have treated it-" (L II, 102). 33. Weiskel's account of the negative sublime also highlights this metacntical or second-order structure. In his largely semiotic vocabulary, the negative sublime "threatens an excess on the plane of signifiers . . ." (27). This incomprehensible sur- plus is answered by "the insertion of a substituted term into the chain [of excess signifiers], i.e., through metaphor. The absence of a signified itself assumes the sta- tus of a signifier ..." (28). Weiskel's definition fails to acknowledge that this meta- phorical substitution will, if regarded uncritically and inattentively, dissimulate its own status as metaphor: it will then seem to emerge like a natural emission from</page><page sequence="19">The Cenci and the Sublime 397 the chain of signifiers. The negative sublime cannot be described using only semiotic categories; there is an epistemological component requiring that the negativity of substitution be recognized. 34. This is consistent with Shelley's statements on the reformer: "In fact, truth cannot be communicated until it is perceived. The interests ... of truth require[] that an orator should so far as possible produce in his hearers that state of mind in which alone his exhortations could fairly be contemplated and examined" (CW VI, 243). 35.

The injunc- tion to imagine sympathetically, to go out of one's own nature, was a commonplace of eighteenth-century philosophy. For an overview, see John M. Bullitt, "Hazlitt and the Romantic Conception of the Imagination," Philological Quarterly 24 (1945): 343-61; and Walter Jackson Bate, "The Sympathetic Imagination in Eighteenth-Cen- tury English Criticism," ELH 12 (1945): 144-64.

This is neither the "instrumental" or "identitary" reason of Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment, nor Shelley's analytical reason of the De- fence, but a sort of Freudian reason or self-knowledge that is both cognitive and affective. The gap between theory and practice is closed by a knowledge that, by dissolving the resistances to its reception, performs itself. 43.
