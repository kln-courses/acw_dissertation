<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analytical Recognition or Visual m?y?? A Cup-Marked Megalith in the Kandak Valley (Swat, Pakistan) by Massimo Vidale and Luca M. Olivieri Nearby there was a long flat boulder with a cleft up one end and its surface pocked with cup-marks. This, said Mahmoud, was the Dragon with its head cut off by Ali. B. Chatwin, The Songlines, London 1998, p. 18. Introduction The present paper deals with a prehistoric megalithic monument. This is a very ambiguous piece of evidence, because it can be interpreted in two opposite ways. According to a first possible view, it might be the output of a random process without any precise meaning, inspired by some unknown supposedly aesthetic or otherwise ideological implications, recognized in prehistoric times but currently inaccessible. Not much, as you see. According to the opposite view, it might be a unique cultic monument to be ascribed to a Vedic, or better Rgvedic, religious context: admittedly, too much, particularly on the present shaky foundations. So, the two alternatives are diametrically opposed, and we have to choose one of the two, unless we decide, instead, that there is not enough information, and one should suspend any type of hypothesis building and speculation. This might be a correct approach, but how far would it take us? The problem is that while recognizing a meaningful structure and designs in the recorded pattern, we may have been the victims of a peculiar process of archaeological self-deception, in which we were convinced of what to see in an otherwise common rock art expression, in order to make an exciting discovery. If our Visual m?ya took us so far, the present paper will represent just another piece of paper in the large scientific dust bin dealing with cup-marked stones in prehistoric and protohistoric times. Nonetheless, we decided to publish both the monument and the complex conjecture that emerged from its analysis, even at the cost of arousing the incredulity and suspicion of many colleagues. In fact, we believe that our hypothetical interpretation is based, as we hope to demonstrate, on a coherent set of regularities and formal associations among graphic elements that are unlikely to fit the idea of a random configuration. The identification of a Vedic rock-altar dedicated to one of the most important divinities [1] 445</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - The megalith before cleaning. (Photo by M.V.). of the Rgveda would be an outstanding accomplishment. But we are well aware that, besides playing with pure conjectures, we might be totally on the wrong side. Colleagues that will not wish to invest their time and attention in questioning such a slippery topic and field, and prefer firmer scientific grounds, should just skip the present article. The Kandak Megalith The present village of Kandak is one of the main demographic poles of the Kandak valley. According to the surface evidence, it might well have been inhabited without interruptions for the last 4000 years, the most evident phases so far being a large protohistoric graveyard (1st millennium B.C.) and a substantial protohistoric and historical settlement. The village was frequently visited while we were surveying the valley for the Archaeological Map of Swat Valley Project (AMSV). The location of the monument appears as Site 120 in the reports published so far (in particular Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004; see also lid. 2002). The monument was first discovered and recorded by one of the Authors (M.V.) in November 2000 (Fig. 1). The most important megalith can be seen at the foot of the present village's slopes, 446 [2]</page><page sequence="3">where the stream narrows and the outcropping boulders provide an easy crossing. In itself, this is the center of a more complex prehistoric scenario: in fact, during a second survey campaign, in May 2004, we became aware that the monument belongs to a larger complex of large cup-marked boulders. A few paces upstream from the boulder, other wide rock walls and huge gneiss boulders cluster on the sandy banks of the Kandak, creating further spaces, cavities and scenes; surrounded by shadows and by the sound of trickling waters, one sees on the vertical faces of other large boulders more cup marks and some isolated vertical trickle-like grooves ending in large cup-marks. Other rock artifacts such as tanks, larger cup-marks and possible axe sharpeners are visible in the immediate surroundings (Figs. 2-6). The monument is a huge, long gneiss outcrop or boulder parallel to the river? bed. It is about 8.80 m long, about 2.50 m wide in its largest section, and emerges from the local sandy bank for a maximum height of 1.05 cm (Fig. 7). Near the stone rises the tomb of a local saint. Its peculiar location at a convenient crossing point, and close to the easiest accessible source of fresh water, would have ensured the megalith had maximum visibility. At the moment of the discovery, the Kandak boulder was covered by an expedient dry stone wall separating two fields, and its upper surface was partially covered by a grass carpet; the lowermost portion of the boulder, to the south, was still covered by a colluvial layer of sand. The whole surface of the rock was cleared. On the northern edge, where the stone gently slopes into a nearby field, we observed some recent ploughing marks. After cleaning, the rock was documented by applying to its surface a few large transparent plastic sheets (Fig. 8), and finally the monument was covered again with its wall and sand. The recording was made by several operators, including our workers, proceeding from various sides of the boulder, without any pre-conceived perception of an overall design structure (only later, when the configuration was pieced back together and reproduced on a much lower scale, was a more complex design finally perceived). The rock has hundreds of cup-marks on the upper surface. They belong to two different levels, separated by a natural step corresponding to the diaclastic line between two superimposed inner layers. The cup-marks appear very worn, and in few cases they were severely eroded, and were recognized only with the help of the sense of touch. The long vertical side of the rock facing the river to the south-east, is covered by a continuous series of winding, trickle-like grooves identical to the isolated ones visible upstream, that end in shallow and larger cup-marks. The general effect suggests a sequence of gently undulating artificial 'ribs'. Also these carvings were badly worn and looked ancient; possibly, in this case as well, we documented only part of the original designs with our plastic sheets. We looked for possible tool traces, but had no success. In general, whatever its actual meaning, the Kandak boulder appeared as an astounding example of megalithic art, well worth the effort of a proper recording.

(Photo by M.V.).</page><page sequence="7">Our boulder possibly bears in the center of the upper surface two different cup marks clusters, separated by a gap, one to the east, the other to the west (for the separate group of cup-marks visible on the lower step, at present we have no hypothesis of interpretation; it apparently includes a wheel-like pattern, of the type we discussed in Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004). Before a more detailed description of the boulder and hypothesis building, a short review of prehistoric cup-mark research follows (see also Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: 164-70). Cup-marks in Eurasian Prehistory In a recent paper dealing with the rock carvings of the Kandak valley (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004), we addressed the problem of one of the most elusive and controversial rock-art expressions in Eurasian prehistory, the so-called ' cup-marks \ In this valley we discovered more than 50 sites with cup-marks, most of which in horizontal or sub-horizontal surfaces, for a total of more than 100 boulders, detached slabs and naturally occurring rock walls. Like the more visible Buddhist monasteries and cultual areas standing out on higher ground, hilltops and terraces, cup-marks are almost a symbol of human impact on the Kandak valley (and, to a lesser extent, on the whole of Middle Swat). The archaeological problem of the cup-marks, even today, is far from having been solved. Spreading across the whole Eurasiatic continent, from the Atlantic coasts to the Japanese islands, cup-marks are particularly common on the alpine and sub-alpine continental corrugations. The Alps, the Caucasus, Karakorum and Himalayas are their common scenarios, where metamorphic schistose rocks splintering into flat slabs provided the moist suitable medium. Here, cup-marks have been associated with megalithic prehistoric art and mostly ascribed to communities of shepherds and herders, starting at least from the end of the Bronze age up to later historical or medieval times. Nonetheless, it is well known that the earliest cup marks so far recorded come from the Mousterian graves of La Ferrassie (France), and one should not exclude the possibility of other ancient cases (Bednarik 2002). In Italy (to start from examples of which we have direct knowledge), the Rupe Magna di Grosio (Lombardy) shows the stratigraphic superimposition of cup-marks over pre-existing figurative rock carvings generically dating to the Copper Age (3rd millennium B.C.) and to the early Iron Age (around the 10th-9th centuries B.C.). Cup-marks are later, and therefore in this case they may be confidently dated to the middle-late Iron Age, i.e. from the early Iron Age to the Roman period (Area 2002). In other important sites in our western Alps, cup-marks appear in funerary sites, on cist-like graves datable to the early Copper Age (Mezzena 1997; Mezzena &amp; Morandi 1992). In the Indo-Pakistani Subcontinent mention should be made of the prehistoric complex with almost 500 cup-marks of Daraki-chattan, in the Chambal valley [7] 451</page><page sequence="8">(India), ascribed by the discoverer to palaeolithic times (Kumar 1996); other similar sites, whatever their precise dating, were reported in Madhya Pradesh as well (Bednarik 2002) the Kumaon complex (see below). In India, also, interesting comparisons may be found amongst living groups or traditional cultures visited and described up to the recent past. For example, at Bhimbetka (Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh) large stone slabs dotted with cup-marks may be found in front of small caves or shelters covered with prehistoric paintings. The slabs appear to have been used for sacrificial purposes (Anati 1995: 39-53). The cup-marks we found in the Kandak area represent an archaic phenomenon for Swat, but are probably not earlier than the mid 2nd millennium B.C., considering the 'sub-megalithic' features of their locations. In fact they appear on large stone slabs of protohistoric graves, and surround rock shelters with rock carvings and paintings (ranging, according to our reconstructions, from 1500 to 500 B.C.); but they also accompany slabs carved with the design of the crossed wheel, and square tanks commonly observed near the Buddhist complexes. Lastly, other cup-marks appear to have been carved with metal tools. Their chronological time span, in the light of this, is probably quite long. One of the earliest attempts to explain the meaning of these rock artifacts was made in the Himalayan piedmont area. J.H. Rivett-Carnac, an often forgotten, but great, British archaeologist, published two papers in which he described a series of cup-marks he had observed on some prehistoric monuments in Kumaon and central India (Rivett-Carnac 1877, 1879). He remarked that cup-marks on the rocks were frequent around 'Mahadeo' shrines and temples, and that these artifacts were associated with carvings depicting Ungarn and yorii signs. As a consequence, he underlined the probable association of cup-marks with a Vedic or proto-Vedic religious background. Twenty years later he attempted to explain the cup-marks' variability or, in his own words, 'permutations', as a proto-writing code (Rivett Carnac 1903). Other recently advanced hypotheses take into account non-visual aspects of perception (in lithophonic terms, see Chakravarty &amp; Bednarik 1997: 59; Kosambi 1987: 48-49, fig. 42). The idea is that even in the past the very act of rotating stones inside the cup marks on the boulders' surfaces might have ritual implications, perhaps connected to the sound, smell or heat generated by the friction, and possibly against the background of a sexual perception of the ritual act. Both examples might be referred to a more general and current practice by the modern rural communities at re-utilizing particular boulders and natural stones, including ancient megaliths, with rituals involving the offering of leaves, fruit, milk and sometimes animal victims. Outside the Subcontinent, another quite interesting but extreme interpretation identified some form of topographic mapping in the large cup-marked surfaces and monuments (Borzatti von L?wenstern 1986; 1987: 388-89, figs. 8-11). More common is the idea that these artifacts are astronomic representations. In our case, 452 t8]</page><page sequence="9">none of the Kandak finds seems to match either of these two interpretations. In the Alps ancient cup-marked boulders are commonly considered some kind of 'altar rocks' by many authors. Another perspective is opened up by the interpretation of the cup-marks as a kind of sacrificial container to be used in Vedic rituals (this hypothesis obviously does not apply to the cup-marks executed on vertical surfaces). On the western side of Eurasia, and in a quite different ideological context, the sacrificial hypothesis is one of the most common interpretations proposed for prehistoric cup-marks (see for example Mt. Bego, in De Lumley 1995, It. ed. 1996: 364-65). In Europe, cults focusing on mountains and waters and on the figure of Herakles involved the use of cup-marks (Barale 1997). Vedic texts frequently mention cups and containers placed on altars, both in domestic contexts and in open-air rituals. Stone cups were used in the initial steps of preparing soma, gradually filtering the juice and finally collecting it in wooden containers. Vedic hymns associate sotna, rain and the urine of Indra, or rain and the seed of Indra-Parjanya, to be collected in vessels. In the Vedic ideology of sacrifice, it is expected that after their use, stone cups and earth revert to plain earth and simple stone, and this might explain the large number of cup-marks visible at certain locations. There is the possibility that also the cup-mark complexes of the Kandak were similarly carved within the framework of a set of implicit or explicit religious concepts: this would account for the apparent lack of easily predictable techno functional regularities in the cup-mark clusters we observed so far in the field. The Icon on the Kandak Boulder as a Bi-triangular Anthropomorph In the following pages, we propose the idea that the cup-marks on the large Kandak boulder in fact might form, at least in part, icons that could be visually interpreted as meaningful representations. This requires a more careful evaluation of the cup-marked patterns, starting from their variously clustered structure. In general, the cup-marks of the eastern cluster are slightly larger and more heavily concentrated than those of the other, and the visual separation of the two basic clusters is easily accomplished. The interpretation depends, as well as on the monument itself, on the familiarity we have with other carved and cup-marked slabs and surfaces, whose patterns seem to obey some kind of implicit rules. The most important regularity is the fact that many compositions of carvings and cup-marks are evidently focused on a central larger 'cup' forming the pivot of abstract compositions, or, in some other cases, suggesting some kind of remote zoomorphic or anthropomorphic characterization (see comparisons in Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004). Pattern recognition in the following lines is based upon an elementary 'join the dots' procedure (Fig. 9). On the Kandak boulder, in fact, the first cluster of cup-marks or dots, on the eastern side of the upper face, seems to be centered on a large cup-mark located to [9] 453</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 9 - The bi-triangular anthropomorph and its club. the north, near the natural step. This large cup has a diameter of 18 cm and a depth of 6.5 cm. Beside this feature two minor cup-marks (diameter 5 cm, depth 1.5-2 cm) are visible, connected to the first one by short linear symmetrical grooves. In deciding to interpret this large cup-mark or basin as a 'head' and the lateral ones as 'ears', we take the first basic step. Two other symmetrical winding canals, reduced in depth by erosion but still visible, depart from the upper side of our 'head' and debouch beyond the figures, into the natural step. If the perception of a 'head' is correct, these grooves might represent horns, fluid tracks, rays of light or some similar feature. The 'head' interpretation obviously requires the body to be in an anatomically compatible position. It could actually be envisaged as having an hourglass-like configuration neatly traced out by means of two opposed triangles (horizontal bi-triangular zoomorphic designs are common in the rock art of the Kandak area and paramount in the Gogdara I rock wall; furthermore, vertical bi-triangular designs for the human body belong to the traditional folklore of tribal India: see for example the Walri pictographs in Kramrisch 1985-1986 and Lehri 1999). So far, we have identified a torso and a head distinguished by 'ears' or 'earrings' and perhaps 'horns'. Another slightly larger cup-mark with a short trickle-like groove running in the same direction as the 'horns' (i.e., beyond the step) is the extremity of a diagonal line of seven large cup-marks regularly alternating with smaller marks. This line crosses the center of the eastern cluster. The body pattern thus reconstructed might fit the diagonal line (important in itself because its extremity, like the 'head', generates a flowing groove) if we assume that it represents a 'club' held by the anthropomorphic figure against his chest. The position of the possible alignments indicating arms and legs might ultimately be in good agreement with this general interpretation. Thus, in the eastern cluster we have seen an anthropomorphic figure apparently holding a club. From both the 'head' and the 'club' depart winding tracks that debouch outside the cup-marked surface, perhaps images of 'rays' or 'fluid flows'. Let us summarize the logical steps of this progressive identification: - isolated larger cup marks may have representational meanings as 'heads' or 'faces'; - in the case in question, this hypothesis matches the presence of lateral 'ears' or 'earrings', by the two 'horns', 'rays' or 'fluid flows' and by; 454 [10]</page><page sequence="11">- the presence in the expected location of a symmetric vertical bi-triangular design suggesting an hourglass-like torso; - a diagonal line of alternating larger and smaller cup-marks crossing this latter design, culminating in a larger cup, and provided with another trickle-like groove, is interpreted as a weapon or 'club'; - two arc-shaped lines of cup-marks, in this latter respect, fit the position of the alleged holding arms very well. Note that only few cup-marks, in this complex design, do not fit and remain unexplained outsiders. But what about the second major cluster? Looking for a Dragon, and Other Patterns On the right hand side, in the opposite cluster, we find about 60 cup-marks clearly having a smaller diameter as a result of general erosion. Applying the 'join the dots' technique and enclosing the cup-marks of the second group in a single contour, we obtain a design in which one sees the profile of a sinuous theriomorphic figure having two legs, curved claws, a large disproportionate head - also in this case having a larger cup-mark in the center, this time suggesting the eye - with wide jaws, long fangs and a curved tongue opening towards the anthropomorph. In particular, the beast would open its mouth and fangs in front of the 'club' of the anthropomorph, i.e. the line of small-and-large alternating cup marks diagonally crossing the upper chest of the main figure. The animal has the sinuous body of the snake, but the legs and the powerful shoulders might qualify it better as a dragon; and the human figure, in this light, seems to push its weapon exactly against the jaws of the creature (Fig. 10). Are we simply being influenced by suggestion and fantasy? All along the eastern side of the boulder we counted 28 trickle-like marks ending in shallow pear-shaped or egg-shaped cup-marks. At the northern extremity of the row - i.e. at the end of the sequence - three of these marks bifurcate, so that the total count may be 28 or 31 - suggesting the days of the lunar or solar months. Thus, if this rock carving is indeed representational in nature - we mean, if the cup-marks are not simply randomly carved in 2-3 groups, two of which are opposed on the base of the circular marks' diameter - we might have a horned anthropomorph holding a club, fighting against a roaring, reptilian monster. If we imagine the rock when hit by the heavy seasonal rains, we would have the rain filling the head of the antropomorh, flowing from its head and horns, from the club; filling the body of the monster, and finally trickling down the boulder into the stream. The whole design, in this light, might be identified as literal illustration of the Rgvedic myth of Indra slashing Vrtra in order to free the rains. [11] 455</page><page sequence="12">Interpreting (and Over-interpreting?) The possible 'club', as we have seen, may be viewed as a linear, single sequence of smaller and larger cup-marks, ending in a larger cup with a flowing groove. If this design alludes to lightning, it might convey the idea that the lightning itself struck its target in a sudden, powerful sequence of blows. No one - as far as we know - has speculated on the distinctive form of the vajra in the earliest Gandharan reliefs; the club of Indra is commonly hold by the Vajrap?ni in the center and the two extremities of the weapon are symmetrically inflated, symbolizing two opposite principles or aspects of the reality, thus alluding to the powers of Indra as creator and orderer of the material world. Could this form also be a simplified expression of lightning striking in a sequence of blows? Notably, the possible image of Indra would recall one of the foundation myths of protohistorical Swat. In another paper (Olivieri 1996) one of the Authors discussed the sacred value of Mount Ham, the most visible and the highest peak in Middle Swat. This has been identified with the Sanskrit toponym of Varana or Varnu, and with the Avestic name of Varsna. This latter indicates the 14th district of the land of the Arya in Widewd?d. The area would correspond to contemporary Buner, and would give the name to the mountain known to the Greek sources as Aornos, to the Chinese as Hi la, and to the Tibetans as Hilo (Olivieri 1996: 69, n. 33). G. Tucci and other scholars emphasized the connection, evident both in the Indian and Avestic sources, between this toponym and the mythical fight of a mighty god armed with a club against a beast-like demon. The fight of Indra against Aurnav?bha (Vrtra), or 0raetaona against Azi Dah?ka was echoed by Megasthenes (Frag. B3, 4) as well as by Alexander's historians in the myth of Herakles and the top of the Aornos. It is a known fact that Alexander revived the myth by conquering the mountain where the inhabitants of Bazira had sought shelter (Dahlquist 1962; Tucci 1963, 1977; Olivieri 1996). Everything suggests that, most probably, one of the most important myths of Swat survived in the legend of Herakles as well as in the tale of Apal?la (Tucci 1958: 281, n. 18 and 19). The Vedic version mentions a creature-mountain, Vrtra Aurnav?bha, capable of repeatedly repelling Indra's assaults, and of finally defeating him (Dahlquist 1962: 120-30). The Avestic source connects this toponym to the birth place of ?raetaona: the district of Varana 'of four corners' (according to a Vedic image, 'telluric'), is described as inhabited by 'non-Aryan masters of the land' [Widewd?d, I 17). If our hypothetical interpretation of the Kandak megalithic monument is accepted, a central element of such a 'Vedic' horizon might be the great myth of Indra, re-interpreted by the Greek sources in Heraklean terms. The divinity Mountain might be identified with a proto-^iva like Zun (a)/Sun (a), who could have been closely associated with Mount Ham/Aornos (Tucci 1963: 165; 1977). 456 [12]</page><page sequence="13">i^kv J I \? \ / / \o ?\ / \\ Vrv&gt; [ V:'- ] // &amp; \ \ Fig. 10 - The theriomorph facing the anthropomorphic figuration.</page><page sequence="14">Recognizing Images by Point Patterns: Perception and Self-deception As you see, we might be dealing with a monument whose cup-marks should be visually read and interpreted as a complex representation. Is this a self-referential way of arguing? We don't think so (see Hogdson 2000). First, in the rock art of the Kandak we have other examples of rocks with cup-marked figurations having visual representational values. In the site of Jowar-jabagai (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: fig. 22) the main boulder of the complex bears the picture of a caprid or bovid, with the main and deepest cup-mark marking the head of the animal. Let us consider the so called 'crossed wheels', often found together with cup-marks, and quite common in the Kandak valley as well as in nearby valleys, from Bajaur to the upper Indus region (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: figs. 6-8; Saeed-Ur-Rehman 1996; Bandini-K?nig 1999). This ideogram is regularly expressed by dot-marks. The same solution is encountered in a concentric wheels ideogram at the recently found site of Lekha gata 1 (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: figs. 10-11 and 41). A visual compositional value is clearly at work in what we defined as 'permutations' of cup-marks arranged in straight or winding lines, simple or double {ibid.: figs. 9, 40). In the stelae from the Khakassia region (southern Siberia, datable to the Iron age) similar permutations of cup-marks and lines support the figurative construction. Examples range from highly simplified patterns to complex designs (Kyzlasov 1986; Sher &amp; Savinov 1999) (Fig. 11). Likewise, permutations of cup-marks on prehistoric monuments in Armenia have been interpreted as tending towards anthropomorphic images. Finally, graphic compositions of dots also appear on the 'decoration' or ideographic patterning regularly traced on the flat surfaces of terracotta figurines from the late period graves of Swat. In this and similar cases, the idea that a series of dots might substitute linear graphics is hardly questionable (Fig. 12). Cup-marks are one of the fundamental 'scribbles' of representations, as they were defined by Kellog (Kellog 1955; Kellog, Knoll &amp; Kugler 1965), and perhaps, in philogenetic terms, to the most archaic one (Bednarik, n.d.; Olivieri 2005). But if we prefer to attribute a conscious combinatory value to cup-mark designs, we must make a logical leap: we have to imagine that the representational choice was to substitute the simplest visual line (a straight line) with a conceptual transformation, demanding, in turn, a higher level of abstraction. If straight lines are a direct product of human sight, according to the principle of simplicity (Arnheim 1954, It. ed. 1977: 159) their substitution by a complex point pattern creates problems. Generally, as 'the basic law of visual perception' we mean the attitude to perceive every figure, and particularly a pattern of points, so that the representation might be the simplest possible for the human eye (ibid.: 64, figs. 26-28). Reading representational images in patterns of points thus requires a sophisticated degree of perception, comparable to the identification of constellations in the apparent chaos of a night sky; on the other hand, non-recognition depends on the same principle, as demonstrated by the exploitation of highly fragmented 458 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 11 - Some examples of stelae from Khakassia. (After Kyzlasov 1986: figs. 69, 77, 93). depictions of common ground features in the military camouflage systems. In a famous experiment, the biologist Paul Weiss placed 7 drops of a silver salt on a background of silver Chromate; eventually, the background itself joined the seven drops into a pattern reproducing the constellation of the Great Bear. By analogy, Weiss asked himself whether the human mind, while joining some key points into [15] 459</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 12 - Late protohistoric terracotta figurines from Swat. (After M?ller-Karpe 1983: pi. 36).</page><page sequence="17">iaot Fig. 13 - Textile designs from Bengal and Gujarat. (After Lehri 1999: 202-203). linear designs, might follow a model of dynamic interaction deeply rooted in our brain {ibid.\ 84). Without embracing such extreme views, after 'the basic law of visual perception' we may accept the idea that the unity of figures might be de-constructed, and separate points might be interconnected, on the basis of identified visual models. The perception of figuration in traditional textile decoration and embroidery (for examples in Bengala and Gujarat, see Lehri 1999: 202-203) (Fig. 13) may be based upon the same principles. In contemporary India and Pakistan, traditional decoration of clothes is reproduced and transmitted by the means of large paper sheets printed with complex perforated patterns. In the Kandak case, the identified visual models might have been provided by special ritual codes belonging to a complex mytho poietic repertory, such as those, we imagine, provided by ancient Vedic religion. There is one final problem: while dealing with prehistoric cup-marks, we should be aware that we cannot imagine the original outer appearance of this peculiar graphic medium. As a matter of fact, cup marks could have been filled with coloured sands or earthen pigments, or with coloured liquids. We simply do not know what they might have looked like in the eyes of the prehistoric onlookers. The points or dot structures, after all, might have been less important than so far considered. [17] 461</page><page sequence="18">Conclusions Maurizio Taddei had a deep personal interest in many marginal aspects of archaeology. Sometimes he openly enjoyed pursuing topics that might have been deemed as obscure, secondary or too controversial by many of us, and turned them into relevant scientific points and vibrant reconstructions of human events. No doubt cup-marks are marginal and strange enough, and they would not have escaped his keen curiosity. He also deeply loved the Indo-Pakistani Subcontinent and its culture, tasting its many paradoxes with continuous interest and undiminished humor. We cannot say how far our reading of the Kandak boulder is valid, nor how much this paper will be taken seriously by indologists and archaeologists; but, as a colleague and friend said to us, sometimes, wrong or right, one needs a little imagination (and a bit of courage) to proceed onwards. What we know for sure is that Maurizio would have been somewhat amused by the oddity of this research, and would not have failed to encourage us with one of his smiles. REFERENCES Anati, E.
