         <p>The question bringing us together concerns God, or more precisely, God <italic>as such</italic>, God <italic>as</italic> God.<sup>1</sup> It would be false to read this as a simple tautology, a different way of asking the question of God. Clearly, God is first at stake here from the philosophical point of view, inasmuch as philosophy can or could encompass such a question in its reach. This occurs when philosophy is unfolded as a philosophical theology, one that owes nothing (or at least claims to owe nothing) to the particular theology of a religion, thus in the end to a Revelation. No one has shown this strictly philosophical position of the question of God better than Feuerbach: “God <italic>as</italic> God (<italic>Gott als Gott</italic>), that is, as a non-finite, non-human, not materially determined, non-sensible being (<italic>Wesen</italic>) is only an object of thought” (Gott als Gott, d.h. als nicht endliches, nicht menschliches, nicht materiell bestimmtes, nicht sinnliches Wesen, ist nur Gegenstand des Denkens).<sup>2</sup> Hence, the issue is to say and think God as such, or, to translate Plato’s expression more literally: “οιος τυγxανϵι ο θϵος ων” ([the] god just as he happens, just as he is) (<italic>Republic</italic> II, 379a), the god as such, such as he is, in his very way of appearing. Actually, to be even more precise, this expression does not yet concern what philosophy and its later metaphysical form understand by the <italic>such as</italic>, the <italic>as</italic>. Yet this transition from one to the other shows only that it remains the chief prerogative of philosophy to exercise such an <italic>as</italic>, and in increasingly more radical fashion. Let us quickly clarify this point, which will become essential for the question of an approach to God <italic>as such</italic>.</p>
         <p>Philosophy begins and unfolds according to a radical conviction, or rather according to a decision, which is both clean and at times obscured by its own evidence: the thing appears, appears from itself (by itself), but it nevertheless does not appear as self, as itself. It does not appear from itself as itself because it can only appear by finding itself returned to what in it determines it more radically than its first appearance. Plato accordingly refers the thing to its appearance in its ιδϵα, Aristotle in its ϵιδος, what we understand today by the <italic>forma</italic> or the <italic>Wesen</italic>, in short, according to its quiddity, that in the thing which can be defined by a discourse, from the most general to the most individual. Understood in this sense, the <italic>as</italic> envisions the individual <italic>as</italic> (its) essence. Or, according to Husserl’s related formulation, at stake is “<italic>the individual, but taken purely</italic> as <italic>(als) specific case of the essence</italic>, in the form of an <italic>in general</italic> (<italic>überhaupt</italic>) … about straight lines and angles in general (<italic>überhaupt</italic>) or ‘as such’ (‘<italic>als solche</italic>’).”<sup>3</sup> The process that exercises the <italic>as</italic> by raising the individual to its essence, by making it undergo an eidetic reduction, allows it to transform into its form, to transpose it into a topic of knowledge. Of course, between the Greeks and Husserl, a new term modified the referral of what appears to its essence. This term was established (if not introduced for the first time) by Descartes, (namely, the term of) the object. Henceforth, essence demarcates what of the appearing can be thematized with certainty, hence what can be constituted as a distinct and defined object, producible from what in it exclusively comes down to order and measure (to model and parameters), so that it might be produced and reproduced in actuality. The object stands out as thing “as arranged according to our knowledge” (<italic>in ordine ad cognitionem nostram</italic>), the thing stands out as object “only” (<italic>tantum</italic>) where order and measure can be found.<sup>4</sup> In any case, and this remains here for us the central point, whether already as object or not yet, essence, determined by the <italic>as</italic>, manages to say the permanent truth about the thing, which its first appearing was not yet able to make available. Thus, what appears, or, to resume Plato’s expression, this “occurring as it is,” belongs henceforth to the realm of essences, essences that seize and determine things as what they are and could be, according to a priori limits and establishment.</p>
         <p>Yet there is more. The <italic>as</italic> can certainly overdetermine and finally define things in their essences a priori. Things would then appear after this reduction. Yet it can also free topics for consciousness, even objects that would not appear before them and that would never appear as such. When, in book Γ of what we call the <italic>Metaphysics</italic>, Aristotle establishes “a science which considers being <italic>as</italic> being” (το ον η ον),<sup>5</sup> at stake is not the essence of a particular being, which we could actually encounter in the appearing. Rather, each real being finds its essence (its ϵιδος, as it happens) in its genre and thus in the regional science that encompasses it. However, the universal science that studies being <italic>as</italic> being (and the singular gives here decisive information) does not remove it from any of these beings, precisely because there are no beings in general, but always things that are from the outset qualified according to their respective essences: living, vegetative and animated, mobile and immobile, sensing and thinking, material and immaterial, accidental and essential, temporal and eternal; in short, rocks, plants, animals, humans, and gods. Yet in the entire appearing of the ϕυσις, there are no things that would appear as beings at first glance. Being only appears by a doubled <italic>such as</italic>, actually redoubling the first <italic>as</italic> of the eidetic reduction, as a grounded act that presupposes grounding acts (the [various] <italic>as</italic> of the first level, which lead individuals to their respective essences and genres). In short, here the science of the second degree, in other words, the establishment of the topic, is accomplished before that of the thing destined to become later its object, when this still anonymous science of being as being will take the modern name of <italic>ontologia</italic>. “There is some science, which studies a being insofar as it is a being; this is in as much as it is understood to have a certain common nature or degree of a nature, which inheres in some manner in corporeal and incorporeal things, God and creatures, and in every thing even so far as singular beings” (Est quadam scientia, quae contemplatur ens <italic>quatenus ens est</italic>, hoc est <italic>in quantum communem</italic> quandam intelligitur habere <italic>naturam</italic> vel naturae gradum, qui rebus corporeis et incorporeis, Deo et creaturis, omnibusque adeo et singulis entibus suo modo inest).<sup>6</sup> While the first, eidetic reduction transformed the appearing thing into its essence by a first <italic>as</italic>, this second reduction, which we will call “ontological” for convenience sake, gives rise to what it alone makes visible, namely, being. It does so without any appearing conferring a theme on it, even less a preliminary thing. Nothing is as much as (is) being <italic>as</italic> being, because the power of second degree of the <italic>as</italic> inscribes it alone into pure beingness. But no one has ever seen being as being appear in the ϕυσις, because the appearing first appears in its essence (with its generic <italic>as</italic>) and even more <italic>before</italic> being (according to its universal <italic>as</italic>). Things are, but they are not beings (even less than they are directly their essences). In the same way as they are according to their essences only by the <italic>as</italic> of an eidetic reduction, so they are only beings by the <italic>as</italic> that makes them appear (or rather maybe <italic>dis</italic>appear) according to the being <italic>as</italic> beings.</p>
         <p>Thus, the universal a priori of the beingness of phenomena is deployed by virtue of the power of the <italic>as</italic> that is immediately doubled. These phenomena find their final articulation in being, in other words, far from their appearing itself. It remains for modernity solely to radicalize the theme of beingness into the objectness of the phenomenon so that the a priori might mark out the reign of the <italic>as</italic> in philosophy. When one evokes the least <italic>as such</italic> in philosophy and when one wants to submit the least phenomenon to it, one is already subject to the power of such a metaphysical <italic>as</italic>. Or, in other words, an <italic>as</italic> radically defines the metaphysical essence of philosophy, even if it does not erase all the possibilities of appearing within it. Having reached this decisive point, albeit in a quick and summary fashion, we can now go back to the question that brings us together—the question of thinking God <italic>as such</italic>, God <italic>as</italic> God. The first formulation of the question is immediately clarified and doubled by another: since the philosophical <italic>as</italic> always establishes an a priori, which precedes and determines the conditions of appearing of any thing it takes as theme (indeed as object), can the two a priori that we have seen emerge, that of essence and that of beingness, be suitable for what we call—at this moment without precaution—God? Can we consider God <italic>as</italic> essence and <italic>as</italic> being, in the question that inquires after God <italic>as</italic> God? Could we self-evidently assume what Heidegger himself admits in a decisive phrase: “Denn auch der Gott ist, wenn er ist, ein Seiender, steht als Seiender im Seyn und dessen Wesen, das sich aus dem Welten von Welt ereignet” (For even [the] God, if he is, is a being, holds himself <italic>as</italic> being in Being and in its essence, which comes from the worlding of the world)?<sup>7</sup> Can we take up this <italic>as</italic> for thinking God <italic>as</italic> God, or do we not rather need another? At the very least, must we not renounce raising this question in regard to God (raising it or receiving it?) according to an <italic>as</italic> of whatever sort?</p>

         <title>II</title>
         <p>The failure in principle of any proof of the existence of God is the best confirmation that it is equally illegitimate in principle to speak of God as such. This failure is even more exemplary in that it is equally obvious whether the proof fails or whether it succeeds in attaining its goal. Hegel warns that in both cases it is a matter of knowing whether “God would be sufficiently rich to contain in himself a determination as poor as that of <italic>being</italic>, which is at the same time the most universal and the most abstract.” For, if it is true that “nothing has a thinner content than being,”<sup>8</sup> then to succeed in showing that this being is included in the concept of God raises a difficulty about the divinity of this concept, a difficulty that is at least as serious as the one that would exclude him from existence. The proof of the existence of God does presuppose that existence by right and first and foremost belongs to God, that is to say, that God as such would have to be understood as an existing being, where, what amounts to the same thing, to understand God as an existing being comes down to understanding him as such. For by what right do we know that the <italic>as such</italic>, which allows considering any phenomenon as being, remains valid in the case of God? How do we know that it would have some qualification whatever it <italic>might be</italic> to say whatever (it <italic>might be</italic>) about the divine, even less about God? And besides, such pretense only manages to impose itself very belatedly, when Suarez asserts without doubt for the first time that “the appropriate object for this science [i.e., metaphysics, that is to say, the science of <italic>being as being</italic>] must comprehend God and the other immaterial substances.”<sup>9</sup> And indeed it is not only here a matter of the <italic>as such</italic> of the a priori of a being as being, but also, at the same time, of the a priori of an essence (of an ϵιδος), that of an immaterial substance (<italic>substantia immaterialis</italic>). Suarez does not doubt for a moment that “the principles of metaphysics must be adapted and relate to reinforcing theological truths” and that hence the <italic>as</italic> being in the final analysis applies to God.<sup>10</sup> The “strongest blow against God,” even before reducing him to the derivative rank of “supreme value” (as Heidegger radicalizes it), could hence already be accomplished in his submission to the questioning that investigates whether he must be understood as a being, albeit supreme.<sup>11</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Kant’s criticism of the ontological argument offers the perfect paradigm for how radically inappropriate it is to apply the <italic>as</italic> to God. More exactly, it shows the impropriety of the ontico-ontological a priori that it exercises. For, in accordance with a remark by Bruaire, it is true that “the ‘refutation’ of the ontological proof is the true key to the entire [First] <italic>Critique</italic>.”<sup>12</sup> Since 1963, <italic>The Only Possible Foundation of a Demonstration of the Existence of God</italic> takes on and applies the metaphysical determination of “the very simply and fully comprehensible concept of existence (<italic>Dasein</italic>),” a concept of which “one cannot say anything further to develop it,” because it amounts to a “concept of position (<italic>Position der Setzung</italic>).”<sup>13</sup> Such a position says nothing and gives nothing to think; it lays down and lays out what is said and thought. We really have here the poorest and the most abstract concept, since it is actually not even a matter of a real concept (concerned with a thing), but of a modality of the object of the concept. This modality concerns not a relation between a concept (as property of an object) to another concept, but of a concept to an object, toward the spirit that knows it. As a celebrated <italic>Reflection</italic> will say: “For the predicate of existence (<italic>Dasein</italic>) I do not add anything to the thing, if not the thing itself to a concept. In an existential proposition, I hence do not leave the concept in order to go toward a predicate different from the one that had been thought in the concept, but I leave it in order to go toward the thing itself with exactly the same predicates, neither more nor less, in such a manner alone that not only the relative position but also the absolute position is thought (<italic>complementum possibilitatis</italic>).”<sup>14</sup> Focusing this doctrine of being <italic>as</italic> being on the case of God <italic>as such</italic>, the <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic> first repeats only the thesis of being as thesis: “Being is obviously not a real predicate; that is, it is not a concept of something which could be added to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing (<italic>bloß die Position</italic>) of a thing, or of certain determinations, as existing in themselves.”<sup>15</sup> It then literally applies to the case of God: while the concept of omnipotence really adds a predicate to the concept of God (and two concepts result from this predication), the concept of the “little word <italic>is</italic>” does not add any real predicate to the concept of God (and only the one original concept remains). If I say “<italic>God is</italic>, or rather ‘There is a God,’ we attach no new predicate to the concept of God, but only posit the subject itself with all its predicates, and indeed posit it as being an <italic>object</italic> that stands in relation to my <italic>concept</italic>.”<sup>16</sup> It is hence shown to be impossible to deduce the existence of God (which has nothing of a real predicate) from his essence (from his real predicates) by pure logic and without any recourse to experience.</p>
         <p>Kant admits (or declares) that the same <italic>as</italic> could be applied in the case of God as much as in any other case, in the infamous argument of the hundred dollars: a hundred actual dollars hold no more perfection (of monetary value) than a hundred possible dollars, which are owned potentially. Whether I own them or not, these hundred dollars correspond to the same concept. The worth of this concept depends on exchange rates, on inflation, on the prize of commodities, and so forth, all very real measures. Yet this comparison, despite or even because of its evidence, shows the weakness of the critique of the ontological argument. It does so in a twofold fashion.</p>
         <p>First, one can and must object that a hundred actual dollars (actually owned, because actually in my wallet, in the form of clinking and clanking coins, real bank bills on valid paper or as a signed check ready for deposit, etc.) do not have the same predicable reality as a hundred possible dollars (dreamed, hoped, expected at the end of the month, etc.) but much more. This is so for a reason Kant himself taught us: dollars are real only because they are given intuitively in space and time; as pure concept, they do not reach existence. In space, precisely, they can leave my possession and move around in order to end up being put in a bank account. In time, exactly, invested with an annual rate of 3, 5, or 10 percent, they will by the end of the year become as counted and calculated res no longer a hundred dollars but 103, 105, or 110 dollars, following the conditions agreed upon by the bankers. This is not a matter of sophisms, nor of embezzlement, nor of a miracle, but the outcomes of the actual banking system, results (in this case of cash) that are directly linked to the position of the dollars in their defined temporal existence, through the interest of any monetary loan. This interest results from the temporalization of the object of experience having become actual. For due to the banking system, over time (for the limit of a year), the hundred dollars will have become 103, 105, or 110 because, more fundamentally, it perfectly verifies the Kantian definition of existence as position, that is to say, “the existence of things outside me, as the condition of the time-determination.”<sup>17</sup> In this sense, the example Kant chose in order to explain that being is not a real predicate proves on the contrary that the position itself implies a growth in the reality of the concept, from the fact of the temporality of existence. Does not Kant himself propose that existence adds something to the thing from the outside, when he ends the critique of the ideal of pure reason by stressing the fact that “the knowledge of the <italic>existence</italic> of the object consists precisely in the fact that the object is posited in itself, <italic>outside of thought</italic> (<italic>außer dem Gedanken an sich selbst gesetzt</italic>)”?<sup>18</sup> Is not such an exteriority of the position added to, and does it not complete thought itself? And what would an unreal complement, an unreal addition mean here? The Kantian critique of the ontological argument can hence be criticized first following Kant’s own definition of existence outside of thought.</p>
         <p>One can also address a second objection to this critique: even by disregarding the first objection about existence, one would still have to allow that existence would apply to all beings, finite (in the case of a hundred dollars) as much as infinite (God). Yet, this obvious univocity is never even mentioned by Kant, much less justified. It appears all the more problematic as here the univocal thesis of the irreducible distinction between concept and existence results not only from finite beings in general, but even from a very particular sort of finite being: money, which as the substitute of any possible being, enjoys an abstract universality, which also excludes it from having the rank of a being in the <italic>real</italic> sense. Yet would not this ambiguous privilege rather forbid the hundred dollars to serve as a paradigm not only for finite physical beings, but even more so for God, who remains by definition the <italic>ens realissimum</italic>? And if there is only an implicit analogy at stake, must we not also wonder about this analogy overturning the habitual order, which refers the finite analogues to the first infinite analogue, by instead displacing the dignity of the first analogue God here with the finite? The puzzle is hidden here by the fact that Kant, although such a great thinker of finitude, is blind to the difference between finite and infinite, which is even greater than the difference between concept and existence. By contrast, Hegel sees it very clearly: “Although there might indeed be some justice [in saying] that the concept differs from being, God differs even more from a hundred dollars and from other finite things. It is the <italic>definition of finite things</italic>, that concept and being are different in them, that concept and reality, soul and body, can be separated, and hence also be perishable and mortal; on the contrary, [even] the abstract definition of God is really only his concept and his being.”<sup>19</sup> One even would have to turn Kant’s refutation upside down: far from existence adding nothing real to the concept of the essence of God, it actually defines his essence, for the same reason as do the other real predicates (infinity, goodness, omnipotence, omniscience, etc.), since if the concept of the essence of God does not include his necessary existence, we would have not a concept of a nonexisting God (which is, moreover, a contradiction in terms), but the concept of a non-God—who would be also and consequently nonexistent. Besides, on this issue, one would be limited to repeating Descartes’s replies to his already Kantian objectors. For the accusation of sophism (confusing concept and existence) itself hinges on a <italic>sophismatis</italic> species—an illusion in the form of a sophism, a mere appearance of argument, namely that of believing that one can think God as nonexisting (“facile mihi persuadeo, illam [sc. existentiam] etiam ab essentia Dei sejungi posse, atque ita Deum ut non existentem cogitari possit” [I find it easy to persuade myself that existence can also be separated from the essence of God, and hence that God can be thought of as not existing]). Yet it is enough to look here more closely (“tamen diligentius attendenti” [when I concentrate more carefully]), to see that it is no less contradictory to think God (the supremely perfect being) lacking existence (that is to say, a perfection) than to think an uphill without a downhill (slope).<sup>20</sup> But a truly “attentive” consideration must go against “habit,”<sup>21</sup> which distinguishes everywhere else what one above all must not distinguish—in the sole case of God: “<italic>nullius alterius</italic> ideam apud se inveniri, in qua eodem modo necessarium existentiam contineri” (it [the mind] cannot find within itself an idea of any other thing such that necessary existence is seen to be contained in the idea in this way).<sup>22</sup> Hence, Descartes and Hegel make clear what Kant does not see or cannot admit: no thesis about being, not even the thesis of being as thesis (<italic>Setzung</italic>), can be applied univocally to finite beings and to God. Thus, by good logic, Kant shows only one thing: not that the ontological argument does not a priori prove the existence of God, but, precisely the opposite, that one cannot prove a priori the existence of any finite being starting from its concept or its essence. Still, Kant shows that existence is not included like a (real) predicate in the concept of any finite object, and that, in the case of God, one must suspend the reply to other considerations, a case that is not here examined as such. In short, let us conclude that the ontological argument never concludes (anything), except maybe in the case of God. Indeed, the case of God remains an exception by definition: his essence, if he has one, could not be summarized in a concept homogenous to that of finite objects, that is to say, one could not in principle exclude his existence from his essence. In taking up again a formula that is literally Thomist “Deus est suum esse” (God is his own existence),<sup>23</sup> Descartes criticizes the Kantian critique of the ontological argument in advance, on behalf of its absolutely unquestioned and completely problematic ontico-ontological equivocity.</p>

         <title>III</title>
         <p>These two objections, however, do not get to the heart of the legitimate and even essential Kantian critique of the ontological argument. They are actually still limited to contesting the logical validity of showing that the argument is supposedly logically invalid, without getting to its a priori presupposition, namely the a priori of a definition of God <italic>as such</italic>. Basically, the question does not consist in deciding whether God exists or does not exist a priori according to his essence (theology and faith can do perfectly well without such proof). Instead, it is about deciding whether there is only one single manner of existing and a single concept of being, and especially whether God must submit to this ontico-ontological univocity, indeed whether God even has to be.</p>
         <p>Kant (but really all of modern metaphysics with him, without the gap between theism and atheism here making any notable difference) never seems to hear this question. Otherwise, he should have concluded the critique of the ideal of pure reason as he concluded that of the paralogisms of pure reason: just as the concepts (or categories) of substance, of simplicity, of personality and of ideality cannot in principle be applied to the <italic>I</italic>, since it “is as little an intuition as it is a concept of any object; it is the mere form of consciousness, which can accompany the two kinds of representation,”<sup>24</sup> so the concepts of existence and the thesis of the position, which are only operative in the frame of sensible intuition, have no pertinence in the case of God, who neither exists nor does not exist, has no obligation one way or the other. Or rather, he should have concluded the critique of the ideal of pure reason as he concluded that of the antinomies of pure reason: just as the concepts of beginning, of simple parts, of freedom and of causality can only be valid for empirically determined phenomena and cannot be applied to “the cosmical idea [that] is either too large or too small for the empirical regress, and therefore for any possible concept of the understanding”<sup>25</sup> in the same way, once again, the concepts of existence and the thesis of position, which are only valid within the frame of sensible intuition, have no pertinence in regard to God, who is not required to exist or not to exist because he does not have to arise in intuition. Or to say it with Jean-Luc Nancy, “The Christian ‘God,’ to the extent that one can call him that, is not posited, not even self-posited. He has no ground, no place for that: he has no world, no other-world, but an opening of meaning which lays out the spatiality of the world in regard to him.”<sup>26</sup> If existence as position is not imposed in the name of the given requirements of sensible intuition, then it has no pertinence at all, no validity and no a priori right in the question of God, which is raised only outside of sensible intuition. Hence, one cannot conclude from the critique of the proofs of God’s existence, and especially of the ontological proof, that one cannot demonstrate the existence of God, but rather that one may not, especially that one should not attempt it here, since God is not required to exist according to this definition of existence. The position of God in existence (or as existing) appears rather as the perfect example of a meaningless proposition, according to the terms of Kant’s investigation. The question of God is only raised in a rational sense if it is not found straightaway subjugated to some sort of a priori, which would pretend to reach God <italic>as such</italic>.</p>
         <p>Kant neither saw nor said that God is only posited rationally as a question by freeing himself from any a priori. Even so, there is at least one instance where he reaches a quasi-formulation of this requirement without recognizing it. In fact, in order to confirm the thesis of being as position, he adds a different and equally ambiguous argument, after the (unfortunate) argument about the hundred dollars. It is an argument from absurdity: if existence were to constitute a real predicate, then my concept of an object (in itself, thought as possible) would never remain adequate to the (real) truth of this object, because such a real object would encompass a greater reality than that of a nonreal object, even the same one (even one with the same essence). In short, no <italic>adequatio rei et intellectus</italic> would remain, because the existence of the <italic>res</italic> would in reality surpass its simple concept or <italic>intellectus rei</italic>. “By whatever and by however many predicates we may think a thing—even if we completely determine it—we do not make the least addition to the thing when we further declare that this thing <italic>is</italic>. Otherwise, it would <italic>not be exactly the same thing that exists, but something more</italic> than we had thought in the concept (<italic>nicht eben dasselbe, sondern mehr existieren, als ich im Begriffe gedacht hatte</italic>), and we could not, therefore, say that the exact object of my concept exists.”<sup>27</sup> From the Kantian point of view, this argument from absurdity can hold sufficiently clearly for the knowledge of objects of experience, that is to say, for finite beings: adequation indeed implies that the existence of the known does not surpass or unbalance the adequation with its knowledge in the concept. But what happens to it in the case of God? How absurd would it be to observe that in <italic>this</italic> case, not only is there more in the actual thing than in its concept, but this excess does not contradict the adequate knowledge of <italic>this</italic> thing, since it is a matter of knowing what, by definition and by hypothesis, must surpass any content possible to formulate conceptually? Even more, by putting forward the strange formulation that “there would exist <italic>not just the same but much more</italic> than I had thought in the concept” (<italic>nicht eben dasselbe, sondern mehr existieren, als ich im Begriffe gedacht hatte</italic>) as an absurdity, Kant literally recovers the expression that St. Anselm had privileged in order to envisage God’s unconditioned positivity rationally. “Ergo Domine non solum es quo majus cogitari nequit, sed es quiddam <italic>majus quam cogitari possit</italic>. Quoniam namque valet cogitari esse aliquid hujusmodi: si tu non es hoc ipsum, potest cogitari aliquid majus te; quod fieri nequit” (Therefore, Lord, not only are You that than which a greater cannot be thought, but You are also something <italic>greater than can be thought</italic>. For since it is possible to think that there is such a one, then, if You are not this same being something greater than You could be thought—which cannot be).<sup>28</sup> This is certainly the same formula—thinking what is unable not to surpass the greatness my thoughts attribute to it—but understood in two opposing ways. For Kant, what is thought (<italic>in intellectu</italic>) must be able to remain equal, hence adequate to the thing really existing (<italic>in re</italic>), even in the case of God, who is no exception to the rule of <italic>adequatio</italic>. Yet as, in this case, one must admit that an existing God would surpass the concept of a (non-)God who is only in thought, one must renounce God in order not to allow this <italic>mehr existieren als im Begriffe</italic>. For St. Anselm, on the contrary, what remains only thought without also being real (<italic>in re</italic>) would be less (great or good) than what would be both thought and actual. Hence, it could not refer to God, who would in this case remain less than himself: God must stand out as <italic>majus quam cogitari possit</italic>. Thus, in order for God to reach an essence suitable to his dignity, he must surpass the simple thought of this essence through the fact of his existence, which nevertheless remains unrepresentable in thought. God is only God by transgressing his own concept (his thinkable essence) precisely through his existence. What is such that nothing greater (no essence) can be thought, would only be thus, if it were to appear greater than anything that can be thought by a concept. Kant thus recovers in the form of an objection what St. Anselm discovered as a solution to the question of God: God is opened to the question when he surpasses the limits of the thinkable, that is to say, the metaphysical a priori that pretends to think him <italic>as such</italic>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc4">
         <title>IV</title>
         <p>Hence, this position, which makes us think according to the <italic>as</italic>, cannot think the unconditioned, but solely what it conditions. It thus cannot think God, since it thinks him according to his <italic>as</italic>, inevitably demanding an a priori excess and transcendentality toward what it imagines as God and whose unconditionality it contradicts all the same in principle. To claim to think God <italic>as such</italic> hence constitutes a performative contradiction, since, if there were anything here of God albeit as hypothesis, he would not be able to evade any a priori other than himself. However odd this conclusion might appear, it is necessary: the <italic>as such</italic> leads to a transcendental idolatry—submitting God to the conditions of the possibility of experience, such as a finite spirit like ours, would define it a priori. To posit as supreme principle the synthetic a priori judgments that the “conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time (<italic>zugleich</italic>) the conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience”<sup>29</sup> is valid precisely only for objects and does not concern God, except if, precisely, one assumes him to be an object submitted to the transcendental conditions of our experience in general. But a God reduced to being an object becomes, by hypothesis and by definition, a non-God. An exodus is thus required: either to release the question of God from the finite territory of our experience and its a priori conditions, or, what amounts to the same, to release us instead from this waymarked, enclosed, and predetermined territory, which the transcendental attitude secures for us by enclosing us in it. This duty of exodus requires suspending this attitude in the case of God, not in order to reach him (who will undoubtedly always remain inaccessible), but in order at least to keep the question open. A duty of exodus that also imposes the paradox that, if by any chance an experience of this question were to remain possible, it would only be able to happen outside of the field of the conditions of the possibility of experience. Yet at least in its metaphysical state, philosophy cannot envision this paradox or this exodus. Either it denies absolutely that a nonobject would be able to show itself outside the a priori conditions of experience without yielding to an <italic>as such</italic>, or it thinks that it has made great progress in the critique of reason (or rather, in order to speak its language, in the critique of any possible revelation from the point of view of simple reason), when it claims to be purified of any anthropomorphism. Under the title of anthropomorphism, metaphysics denounces the use of definitions drawn from the sensible world, from the imaginations of poets and from human passions in order to describe the essence of God. Yet it only denounces them in order to substitute for them more formal, universal, and a priori concepts, without which its own transcendental posture would become untenable, and in order to reestablish an anthropomorphism of the second degree, which claims to think God as principle, supreme being, final truth, moral author of the world, value of values, even future man, and so forth. Feuerbach allowed this to the point of making it his basic teaching, by attributing simply to theology what is valid only for the metaphysical interpretation of theology: “the <italic>secret of theology</italic> is <italic>anthropology</italic>.”<sup>30</sup> That these idols of a second degree could also lead to such a non-God does not change anything in the matter: conceptual atheism repeats the transcendental idolatry and consecrates it even all the more that it makes it play in the void, in the absence of any “God,” an empty scene where only his mere appearance still explodes in full light.</p>
         <p>What path unfolds for such an exodus? Let me point out, however, that an exodus does not follow a path that is already traced and known before departing, but, on the contrary, the path follows the beginning movements of the exodus, which alone can open it. The path does not precede the exodus, but follows it. It emerges in accordance with the progress made, if one turns around each step of the way one has covered, and thus it is seen only retrospectively. Let us hence proceed step-by-step. We must leave the position that fixes and freezes experience in objects by exercising the <italic>as</italic>. And since one shuts off any access to God by claiming to aim at him <italic>as such</italic>, it will be advisable to approach God always <italic>quoad nos</italic>, regarding us, relative to us, according to our finitude, which forbids us to claim to approach God as such, absolutely. Yet how should we understand this <italic>quoad nos</italic>, this “regarding us”? Does not such an approach relative to us precisely define the critical enterprise itself, which unfolds its a priori only in relation to ourselves? Furthermore, does not this <italic>quoad nos</italic> characterize even more exactly the categories of modality, and those of possibility and of existence, which actually describe neither the object itself (as do those of quantity and of quality) nor the relations among real objects (as do those of substance and accidents, of cause and effect, and of the community of substances), but which “express the relation to the faculty of knowing”?<sup>31</sup> In this case, to invoke the <italic>quoad nos</italic>, “regarding us,” makes us regress into the <italic>as such</italic> we wanted to leave, and we would have sunk further into aporia. All the same, here as is so often the case, the opening arrives as the aporia increases. What are actually the stakes between the <italic>quaod nos</italic> critique and the principles of modality? Let me repeat one more time that it is a matter of establishing that the relationship between the object and the faculty of knowing is determined by its possibility (whether the object corresponds to the formal conditions of experience), its existence (whether it satisfies its material conditions), and its necessity (whether it suits its universal conditions). Thus, it is a matter of possibility, maybe extended into existence and necessity. And indeed, in the case of God, the impossibility of the demonstration of existence says <italic>quoad nos</italic> in the dimension of modality. It really goes without saying that, for Kant, God as object does not attain existence because he does not first comply with possibility (with its conditions of experience in space and in time). The impossibility of satisfying the a priori conditions of experience <italic>as such</italic> closes to God any access to possibility, hence to existence. Hence, the metaphysical <italic>as such</italic> is characterized by the limits it fixes for possibility in general, of which that of God only offers one particular case (indeed, it is not very particular, in no way exceptional). Yet by contrast, the <italic>quoad nos</italic>, at least in the sense where this “regarding us” is opposed to the metaphysical <italic>as such</italic>, would be characterized by the transgression of the a priori limits imposed on possibility, in other words, by the overcoming of the boundary between the possible and the impossible—by the exodus toward the impossible.</p>
         <p>Access to the question of God <italic>for us</italic> must henceforth begin from what characterizes us and us alone, the boundary between the possible and the impossible, toward what characterizes it <italic>for us</italic>, the impossible <italic>for us</italic>. Yet for metaphysics, which only admits as object what is possible for our thought (logical noncontradiction, transcendental possibility, the difference matters little here), impossibility remains an unquestioned modality, forgotten and left as fallow—a simple reverse of possibility. For metaphysics, it is only a matter of looking for the unique possible grounding of a proof for the existence of God, and it is the impossibility of this possibility of grounding that suspends the search for any such proof. This stopping, for all that, is only necessary if one admits as self-evident that God himself does not constitute any exception, that he must exist, that this existence would have to be demonstrated, that this demonstration must be grounded, and especially that these three thoroughly uncriticized requirements are exclusively registered in the territory of possibility. Yet what possibility is meant here? Obviously ours, finite and hence restricted to our exercising an <italic>as</italic> in a priori fashion. How could one not see that a God restricted to our possibility in this way, whether he exists or not, is demonstrated or not, grounded or not, is shown to be a non-God straightaway and definitively, because the question of God, when it is posited in this way, necessarily leads to a nonplace? Here Nicholas of Cusa’s paradox becomes intelligible: “It follows that, since nothing is impossible to God, it is necessary that we would look across the things which are impossible in this world toward him for whom the impossible is a necessity” (Unde cum Deo nihil sit impossibile, oportet per ea quae in hoc mundo sunt impossibilia nos ad ipsum respicere, apud quem impossibilitas est necessitas).<sup>32</sup> As long as we stick with the battlefield of possibility <italic>for us</italic>, without wondering about the impossibility it reveals implicitly, we camp out in the territory where it can only be a matter of our finitude, of us, hence in no way of God. God only becomes a meaningful question from the moment at which our exodus transgresses the limits between the possible and the impossible <italic>for us</italic>, since the true <italic>quoad nos</italic>, the decisive “regarding us” confronts us with what does not belong to us, what remains essentially foreign to us, with the unthinkable for any <italic>as such</italic>—the impossible as the closest unknown. Hence, only God comes to mind: unless our idea, by imagining to bear itself toward God, will continue to forge for itself always new possible idols, <italic>idola possibilitatis</italic>. Only the incommensurable field of the impossible can deliver the least inkling of something sufficiently foreign, in other words, of what is too strange, in order to merit legitimately the un-naming of God.<sup>33</sup> God only comes to us to the exact extent that we march toward the impossible. Only the impossible can guide us toward this epiphany like a sure star in a catastrophic universe.<sup>34</sup>

         <p>The impossible guides us in the exodus away from the idolatry of God as such. Even so, this paradox should not throw us off track, since it literally puts us on track toward the question of God. It contains nothing unthinkable, provided we respect its particular logic. Let me formulate its core without taking up again in detail an argument I have developed elsewhere.<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In order to pose the question of God, reason must confront what is unique to God: whether he is or is not and what he would be. God is capable of what is impossible for humans (as said Homer and the ancient Greeks and Latins); or rather, God is capable of all that does not diminish his omnipotence (as thought the medieval theologians); or rather, God is the being who is capable of everything (according to Descartes and the Cartesians); or rather, finally, God holds the place of the impossible, indeed takes place as impossible (according to the thinkers of the end of metaphysics). The agreement of these traditions appears all the more impressive as they are opposed to each other on almost any other matter. In any case, a question only becomes a question of God, if our thought leaves its own territory of the possible, thus of the finitude that limits the impossible, in order to advance into the unthinkable territory of the impossible for us. For if a God would have to give up becoming an impossible, by definition he would only be a non-God. A first result follows from this: whether there is a God or not, whether he would have being or not, God is either said as the master of the impossible or fails to be said. Consequently, a reasoning that would conclude his impossibility (God does not exist because he does not admit of any concept, or because his essence would be contradictory or even immoral, etc.) in regard to a possible (and maybe optional or illegitimate) proof of the existence of God, becomes itself impossible. For if God is characterized by the impossible <italic>for us</italic>, the impossibility of conceiving him or of reaching him (which is obviously an impossibility for us) only intensifies the fact that he inhabits the territory of the impossible, which by definition we cannot access. It might not be possible to prove the existence of God (or, moreover, whether God has to exist or to be), but it is impossible to prove this impossibility <italic>for him</italic>, because the impossible only applies to us, dwellers of the possible, and has no meaning for him. Obviously, the point here is not to restore underhandedly the ontological argument (which depends on the necessity of the existence of God starting from the possibility of his existence), or to restore a skeptical fideism arguing that “the impossibility I have of proving that God does not exist discovers his existence for me”<sup>36</sup> (where existence dispenses with the possibility of demonstration), but it leads us to the conclusion to which Kant himself came: “In short, it is impossible to demonstrate that God is impossible” (Kurz, es ist unmöglich zu beweisen, daß Gott unmöglich sei).”<sup>37</sup> This does not mean that possibility reestablishes itself fantastically beyond the limits of the possible <italic>for us</italic> or that the impossible <italic>for us</italic> would disappear, since instead the impossible is doubled here. Yet what remains or becomes impossible consists in this: the impossible <italic>for us</italic> (and remaining such for us) appears from a point of view inaccessible for us (namely that of God) but possible <italic>for him</italic>. It is not a matter of annulling the boundary between the possible and the impossible for us, but to make impossible for us that the difference between the possible and the impossible would still be valid for God. We do not abolish the impossible into an imaginary possible for us, but we disqualify the conceit that assumes that what remains impossible for us would also be so for God. We must, so to speak, make the <italic>quoad nos</italic> (the “regarding us”) revolve around the impossible, so as to envision possibility for God in it.</p>
         <p>A second consequence follows from this. The question of God survives the (possible) aporia of the response to this question. Even if the existence of God cannot and must not be proven, either because proving it would submit God to the conditions of our experience (and would result in a non-God), or because God does not have to be; even if, from our finite point of view, the “death of God” remains an unsurpassable horizon in this time of nihilism; even if we must at best abide in the “death of the death of God”—nevertheless the question of God remains open, like a wound that will not disappear, or rather like an appeal to exodus that will never be shut down. We find ourselves in a position of postatheism (which is more than a simple variant of post-theism), in the process of <italic>ana</italic>theism.<sup>38</sup> Supposing that we could rely only on Christian doctrine (and not, rather, on what it has made real, but that surpasses it immeasurably toward a different future, that is to say, the event of Christ), the impossibility of impossibility would suffice to put it beyond any deconstruction, because it consists itself precisely and straightaway in a deconstruction. This deconstruction results from its doubling of impossibility and demonstrates the entire limit of the possible that the metaphysical <italic>as</italic> has attempted. Furthermore, one cannot qualify Christianity as the religion of the leave-taking of religion, because it precisely does not constitute a religion. It does not constitute a religion because all religion connects humans in a possible commonality with the gods or even with a (non-)God, while the event of Christ puts Christians (and really all humans) in relation with the impossible for us as the possible for God. The salvation, which gives its name to Jesus (and reciprocally), arises by the confrontation with the impossible it imposes. It descends from the heavens like the Jerusalem of our exodus, a Jerusalem that we will not be able to conquer, or build, because it comes to us from elsewhere. “For humans this [is] impossible, but not for God. For all things [are] possible for God” (Mark 10:27). In other words, “τα αδυνατα παρα ανθρωποις δυνατα παρα τω θϵω ϵστιν” (what is impossible for humans is possible for God) (Luke 18:27). Christianity’s deconstruction in the final analysis comes down to the destruction of what was made impossible by the metaphysics that seized it at least partially and for a time, namely, access to the true impossible: the gift of God, which nobody has ever seen, in Christ Jesus, who made possible its only exegesis (John 1:18) and hermeneutics (Luke 24:27).</p>

      <sec id="sc6">
         <title>VI</title>
         <p>A different paradox remains. How can we relate to the impossible from the depths of our proper place as mortals, the place of the possible? Undoubtedly, we would first have to argue that we would have no consciousness of this possibility without a preconsciousness of the impossible, namely through the idea of the infinite that according to strict Cartesian logic alone makes thinkable the idea of the finite. Thus, let us brush up against the border of the possible and of the finite (and brushing up against a border is sufficient for knowing it and for assuming what is beyond it). We do so as soon as we contemplate the possibility of the infinite, by definition impossible for us, <italic>quoad nos</italic>. More exactly, this <italic>quoad nos</italic> only reaches us or defines us because we can and therefore must always already return to it, like an impossible possibility for us, toward the impossible for the other than us. We experience this transgressing return straightaway in the un-naming of the <italic>id quo majus cogitari nequit</italic>, itself radicalized into <italic>majus quam cogitari possit</italic>. (I repeat that this does not imply any proof of existence and refuses even the least pronounceable essence.)</p>
         <p>But there is more: one can contest Kant’s reduction of phenomena to the rank of objects, by envisioning the possibility, even and first for us, of saturated phenomena, where intuition via excess would be shown to be irreducible to its subsuming under a concept (or combination of concepts) of any sort. Thus, in response to the four rubrics of a priori categories, the event (in regard to quantity), the idol (in regard to quality), the flesh (in regard to relation), and the icon or face of the other (in regard to modality).<sup>39</sup> Yet the excess of intuition here ruins the transcendental possibility, by restoring the itself of the thing that appears or can appear through its own initiative and following its proper dimension, exceeding our expectation and our precomprehension, that is to say, our a priori. The case of God, ignored by Kant, assuming he should ever manifest himself (reveal himself, hence manifest himself as a phenomenon, however paradoxical), can only take place by surpassing any place and any localization in thought <italic>for us</italic>. In this sense, saturated phenomena outline or anticipate already the experience of the impossible in the possible itself. By their essential and common event-like character (and, moreover, the first type of saturated phenomenon, which determines all the others, consists precisely in the event), they attest only the impossible that we have all experienced, although we have never comprehended it—and precisely for this reason. The move to the impossible <italic>for us</italic> happens in certain instances at the very heart of the possible <italic>for us</italic>, just as the move to the infinite remains an intrinsic possibility for the finite. Certainly this does not happen through an experience of the object or of the finite phenomenon, which we would be able to synthesize and constitute according to our a priori, but it occurs in the mode of a counterexperience, which constitutes us and forbids us to synthesize it, and stripping us of the transcendental dignity of the <italic>I</italic> leads us to the status of the witness. This familiarity with the impossible <italic>for us</italic> in the middle of a henceforth bedazzled (or rather dazzling) possible <italic>for us</italic> can be described, at least in outline, for three privileged cases. These three saturated phenomena occur by marshaling in themselves the work, the patience, the seriousness, and the pain of the impossible <italic>for us</italic>.</p>
         <p>The first instance is due to death, and its description brings together a double insight of the phenomenological tradition, whether one describes it as the possibility of impossibility (Heidegger) or as impossibility of possibility (Levinas). Certainly the difference between the two approaches cannot be underestimated. When contemplated from the starting point of <italic>Dasein</italic> (or rather when what one envisions from it consists in <italic>Dasein</italic>), death remains first and foremost a possibility. Even more, it is the possibility par excellence for <italic>Dasein</italic>, who here finally discovers its being as possibility and not as a simple actuality, as in the case of the being of other beings. Even so, the fact remains that such a possibility, that of being-toward-death that is accessible only in the mode of the possible, leads to the absolute impossibility of any possibility. The final impossibility hence rightly becomes the very name of <italic>Dasein</italic>’s possibility, who experiences it via anticipation precisely as not experiencing it (counterexperience). Conversely, from the viewpoint that starts from the other (or rather when what one envisions in it consists in the suffering face of the other), death appears as the constraint that withdraws the slightest possibility from the other. Far from opening a nonreal possibility, it closes possibility itself, in general. Yet this abolition of possibility retains a positivity, precisely the one that allows experiencing impossibility directly. Directly? Not at all, since it is a matter of an impossibility to which only the one who does not experience it can bear witness, namely the survivor, who watched the other and not he himself endure it (or rather, the one who does not remain any longer in order to endure any sort of possibility). Here also, impossibility only comes through counterexperience. The difference of the phenomenological situations does not eliminate a common point: impossibility announces itself in death without the impossible here becoming accessible as such. The impossible remains outside of the range of the possible <italic>for us</italic>, even and especially because it determines it entirely for the final time. The impossible announces itself as an absolute impossible, which annuls any possible <italic>for us</italic>, even that of experience as such. Even so, this excess of impossibility, which makes itself inaccessible at the precise moment of its greatest immanence by annulling any possible for us, turns itself around and turns into absolute possibility itself: of death, a possibility never attained for <italic>Dasein</italic>, an impossibility always inaccessible to the living witness in face of the dying; I know nothing of either, because I am never there. All the same, one can only conclude from this that when I will be there in person, there will no longer be a person to know it, hence death will never appear to me. On the contrary, if we know nothing of nothingness since I am not there, it remains the authority par excellence of the possible. And this is a possible that, since we know nothing of it by analogy with or anticipation of a possible experience for us, we must admit to harbor the entirety of the possible in general, here including what we call today the impossible <italic>for us</italic>. Insofar as death is impossible for us, it imposes on us the possibility for us of the impossible as such, without restriction.</p>
         <p>The second case turns to birth. Here also the recent phenomenological tradition (Ricoeur, Henry, Romano) has established a description. Possibility par excellence is given in birth, the possibility of all possibilities. Not only because my coming to life constituted the indisputable condition for me to be able to deploy my faculties, execute my actions, encounter events, manage useful beings, love and hate other humans who were themselves born, but because what we name “life,” without ever being able to define it, consists precisely in the open (or better, opening) possibility and, by functioning thus as an opening, it opens the world and time, the world through time. This possibility of all possibilities goes even further: because it is the condition of possibility of other possibilities, it does not itself admit any condition for its own possibility. It does not even let in the authority that will define all these other possibilities indicated to arrive, namely myself, an <italic>I</italic> who wants them, foresees, decides, and executes or submits to them. Birth does not presuppose me, since it posits me and deposits me before itself; instead, I am the one who presupposes it. Although absolutely and inalienably mine, birth does not belong to me any more fully than life itself does, my life that I live and that does not belong to me—since, on the contrary, I live it only as long as it comes to me as not belonging to me, as it sustains me from outside myself, more me than myself, who am only through it and who am not it. My birth gives me everything, here including receiving it and receiving myself from it, together with all the other givens, as a posteriori as they are (I am given over to it). My birth confers my origin on me although I do not coincide with it—my origin refuses me any access to my origination. It gives me a possibility of originarity to which I can in principle not return. The origin hence indicates also the impossibility for me to reach my own origination. The impossible appears in the closing of the origination of my origin. What gives all possibility to me does so only by showing me the impossible: first, my impossibility of going back to the origin, then the originary impossibility of knowing the origin from which I come forth. From what nothingness (or, what amounts to the same, from what prior being) could I have come forth ex nihilo? The impossibility of responding to this question results from the impossibility of reaching my origin originally as an ontic and derived indication. And hence my birth allows me straightaway to reach the impossible.</p>
         <p>It remains to attain to the impossibility of impossibility, which we have above established as the distinctive feature of the question of God, even if merely from afar. Does not this case, which doubles impossibility for us by the impossibility for God, surpass decidedly what could approach the possible for us, even in the mode of counterexperience? While maintaining all precautions, one must nevertheless not renounce such an approach, even if remote. For there is a phenomenon that no impossibility can hold back from remaining possible, regardless of how impossible it might appear: the gift. For the gift is given and gives itself really without any presupposition, without the least condition of possibility. I only give by giving without reason, and this absence of reason (a fortiori of causality) precisely qualifies my gift as gift. For if I were to give for a reason (or due to a cause), I would engage in exchange, which is usually a laudable activity and certainly indispensable for the establishment of sociability, but which, as exchange, only gives in order to receive a just retribution in exchange. It does not matter in the end whether the recompense is real (a different thing, a sum of money) or unreal (an honor, a recognition, a service); I always have, or rather <italic>we</italic> have, good and sometimes just reasons for exchanging our gifts—which precisely are such no longer, since we have turned them into trade. The gift begins where trade ends, that is to say, where the reasons (and causes) for exchange disappear. The gift begins when I give expecting nothing in return, even if, sometimes, though not always and not often, a countergift comes, with the same lack of reason (and of cause) crossing my own free gratuitousness. I give for nothing, but also without giving preference to anyone, and, when I give truly, I give without giving anything—nothing other than myself. Therefore, the unconditioned unreality of the gift hinges entirely on the intention of giving, not because this intention gets rid of actual giving (faith without works is no longer faith at all), but on the contrary because a gift without intention of unconditioned gratuitousness would no longer be a gift, regardless of how real the exchange of property would have been (giving against one’s will does away with the gift). From what faltering condition, what impossibility could make the gift impossible, if it only gives without reason, without reciprocity or reality, without anything other than itself and its intention? Nothing remains impossible for it, since it demands nothing but itself: <italic>bonum diffusivum sui</italic>, in other words, <italic>donum index sui</italic>, not <italic>causa sui</italic> but rather <italic>gratia sui</italic>—the gift gives by love of giving. Thus, even in the territory of the possible for us, the impossible does not remain impossible for us.</p>
         <p>The unconditioned, this peculiar characteristic of the question of God, thus does not remain foreign to us. It inhabits us, is more intimate to us than we are ourselves and is more highly elevated than our greatest excess.</p>
