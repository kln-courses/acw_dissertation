Meinertzhagen (Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh) xiii + 624 pp., 1 folding map, 19 col. pls., 9 black and white pls., 53 text figs., 35 distribution maps, August 11, 1954. Four guineas.-As the first book to be written on the birds of Arabia this work fills a distinct place in the faunal literature of orni- thology. That it will continue to do so is apparent from the obviously intimate knowledge of the country and its bird life that the author has brought to bear in his presentation. Where the data are meagre or unreliable, the author points out the need for improvement, and it is to be hoped that there may be found other natu- ralists to pick up where this account leaves off and eventually complete the picture. Arabia is strategically located at the meeting place of three great faunal regions, the Palaearctic, the Oriental, and the Ethiopian, and its bird life contains species of fairly obvious affinities with each of these sources, as well as others that span them. To most of us, Arabia, if it conjures up any mental picture, means desert. While the greatest part of the land is arid or pure desert, Meinertzhagen points out that there are large areas in the southwestern and the southeastern parts of the country that rise to about 11,000 feet to what is almost an alpine zone. Being a great peninsula surrounded by water on three sides, the country has an unusually long coastal belt for its size-nearly 4,000 miles of seashore, and thus has come to include in its avifauna a large number of shore and water birds. According to a rapid tabulation of the birds recorded in this book, Arabia may claim an avifauna of 381 species, or, including races, 502 species and subspecies of birds. However, considerably less than 100 of these breed in the great peninsula, the rest being winter- ing birds, migrants, or stragglers. In his account of each species and subspecies, the author gives what details he can of its local distribution and habits, as well as diagnostic descriptions of its plum- ages. This naturally comprises the largest part of the book and is the part that will be of continuing usefulness to ornithologists. Occasionally interspersed with these accounts are some statements that show the author's long preoccupation with certain species, and these form welcome summaries. Thus, of the yellow wagtail, of which species no fewer than 14 races have been found to occur in Arabia, Meinertzhagen writes that the species has "an almost entirely continental distri- bution, and yet we find the reverse of normal variation in that it is not clinal. This is due to the fact that every population is isolated by virtue of its eco-tolerance, which confines them to valleys, swamps and lake shores; their distribution can be likened to that of a species which is distributed over a huge archipelago composed of many hundreds of islands, each isolated from the other and each having its dis- tinctive race; and yet they all, or almost all, meet and mix in their winter quar- ters . Aside from the systematic portion of the book, there are chapters on the geology, geography, and climate of the country, on desert coloration, on distribution and migration of birds, and one on the history of Arabian ornithology. The author has his own ideas on such topics as desert coloration and presents them in an un- necessarily one-sided fashion. In so far as his statements may be taken as his reactions to his observations, no one need quarrel with him, but they are not as final as their presentation seems to infer. Here and there, throughout the book, Meinertzhagen has written with some impatience and irascibility; trends and workers with whom he disagrees are dismissed in rather highhanded manner, and potential critics or dissenters are written down in advance.</page><page sequence="2">r Auk 98 Recent Literature Lvol. 72 Occasionally the author lets himself go in ill advised anthropomorphic expressions, as when he defends his arrangement from crows to ostriches instead of the other way about. "I have resisted the more modern system of placing the most archaic, the stupidest and least educated birds first, as it seems to follow the modern trend to democratise systematics; I prefer placing the best educated, most intelligent and socially superior birds first. Birds are by no means a classless society and cannot be made so, any more than can the human race . Some of his com- ments on bird behavior are similarly anthropomorphic. The volume is a handsome example of fine book making; it is well printed on heavy, coated paper, and is embellished by a profusion of illustrations. Of the 19 colored plates, D. M. Henry is responsible for 13, G. E. Lodge for 5, and A. Thor- burn for 1. Most of the subjects are well chosen, but it seems a pity to have left some of the little known, desert birds unfigured and to have given colored plates of such familiar creatures as the ringed plover or the hepatic form of the European cuckoo.-HERBERT FRIZDMANN.</page></plain_text>
