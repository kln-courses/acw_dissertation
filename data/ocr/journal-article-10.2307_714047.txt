<plain_text><page sequence="1">301 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW closely kin to the foot soldiers depicted on the famous LHIIIC Warrior Vase from Mycenae; a further attribute is a lyre which he carries in his raised hand, and which persuades I. to recall the portrayal of Achilles in Iliad 9: more likely, perhaps, the Homeric parallels (particularly in the form of Paris) might suggest that in the lyre-playing warrior there is the antithesis of the worlds of peace and of war. However, it is the sudden appearance of silhouette portrayal which is the most important feature of Proto-White Ware, and I. maintains the Syro-Palestine affinities of the technique against a proposed Minoan origin. A modified form of this latter is presented by Vassos Karageorghis in 'The Pictorial Style in Vase-painting of the Early Cypro-Geometric Period'. K. engages with I.'s earlier The Pictorial Pottery of Eleventh Century BC Cyprus (Goteborg, 1988) rather than her conference paper, pointing to larnakes of LM Crete as possible prototypes, whilst stressing the role of the native painter in thus fusing influences from both Aegean and Levant into the distinctive Cypriot pictorial style. Similarly Louise Steel in 'Pictorial White Slip-The Discovery of a New Ceramic Style in Cyprus', discussing a fragmentary White Slip krater discovered at Kalavasos in 1994, takes full account of the oriental connotations as well as the elements of Mycenaean pictorial style in its decoration, but nevertheless gives proper emphasis to it as a local response to these external influences. Other subjects covered in this wide-ranging volume include Ellen Herscher on 'Representational Relief on Early and Middle Cypriot Pottery', Karin Nys on 'Vases with Anthropomorphic Protomes in the Cypro-Geometric and Cypro-Archaic Periods (1050-475 BC)', Helene Cassimatis on 'Le rhyton a Chypre a l'epoque historique', Frieda Vandenabeele on 'The Pictorial Decoration of the Cypriote Jugs with Figurines Holding an Oinochoe', Demetrios Michaelides on 'Magenta Ware in Cyprus Once More', Robert Laffineur on 'The Cypriote Ring-Vases Reconsidered', and Antoine Hermary on 'Le "style d'Amathonte" '. For this breadth of subject matter and, in particular, for the speed of publication, there is inevitably a price to pay: spelling and typographical errors-'long-robbed figure', 'to a large extend'-are numerous; there is a serious displacement of plates illustrating Iacovou's piece-in her catalogue vase no. 4 is plate XIIc (not XIIIa), no. 5 is XIIIa (not XIIIb), no. 6 is XIIIb (not XIIIc), no. 7 is XIIIc (not XIIId), no. 8 is XIIId (not XIIIe), no. 10 is XIIIe (not XIVb), no. 11 is XIVb (not XIVc), on p. 64 vase no. 12 is plates XIVc and XIVVd (not XIVd and XVa), and the kalathos discussed on p. 67 is plate XVa (not XVb), whilst plate XVb receives no acknowledgement in the text; plate XIIc is reproduced at XIXb but, once again, we miss editorial cross-reference; in Nota Kourou's Early Iron Age categorization of zoomorphic askoi (p. 90) her plates are XXIVa-d (not XIVa-d). At times these flaws can be distracting rather than merely irritating; and although the significance of the individual contributions offers adequate compensation, they collectively lack the cohesion which the importance of the subject so clearly merits.

This impressive tome comes hedged about with mildly defensive background information about the history of its parent excavation, and the circumstances in which the work on its material was done; in fact the joins are not evident to anyone but those already possessed of the knowledge, and the difficulty of what Jeremy Rutter was asked to do is transparent, not least because archaeological method has moved on in the forty years since the original excavation. Lerna, in the Argolid, is regarded as the type-site for the pre-Mycenaean period in southern Greece; Lerna IV, to which the pottery series typologized here belongs, is the Early Helladic III settlement which follows the destruction of the House of the Tiles. Lerna was originally excavated in the 1950s, and reported in Hesperia by John L. Caskey, the then Director of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens; ill-health and other commitments meant that he did not see the project to completion; Lerna I (1969) and Lerna II (1971) deal with fauna and people respectively, and the American School is now engaged in extending the series and particularly in initiating publication of the artefacts from the site.

Although views on this have changed since Lerna was dug, in the light of important excavations at other sites, the Lerna material is so voluminous that it must continue to play an important part in any understanding of the cultural shift implied in the chronological subdivision. Physico-chemical analyses of the pottery were undertaken by Sarah Vaughan, George Myer, Philip Betancourt, and Richard Jones, and appear here as extremely full appendices, liberally supported by tables and graphs, and given an archaeological analysis by R. Elizabeth Banks provides a chapter of introduction to the nature and problems of Lerna IV, a phase defined by excavation of the area east of a tumulus over the burnt debris of the House of the Tiles. The phase is characterized on this site by continued use of apsidal buildings orientated east-west, and by rapid multiplication and evolution of its structures. R.'s pottery analysis depends on rigorous classification by class, shape, and decoration, all extremely carefully defined, as are the other technical terms he uses-a serious attempt to make the language of artefact description objective. His catalogue is followed by a shape analysis, which he uses as a tool for discussion of the evolution of the types he identifies, and, as elsewhere, uses tables to look at comparative material from other sites. He is thus able to argue that the shape repertoire of EHIII Lema is very different from the last phase of EHII, and also that it shows a mix of elements, some clearly indigenous, others imported. He regards the important intrusions as those from eastern central Greece and the eastern Aegean, i.e. along one natural trade route. The chapter on decoration supports the conclusions drawn from the shapes. He is also able to distinguish a late phase of Lerna IV in which he relates further abrupt changes of shape to internal reorganization, perhaps linked to some of the building phenomena on the site, and discards the possibility of the incursion of a new ethnic group as a probable cause. This conclusion is likely to be a controversial one; the book itself is an outstanding example of a rigorous approach to the treatment of archaeological artefacts, and should serve as a yardstick for later volumes.

The focus of this archaeological study is a late Geometric funeral pyre (Pyre A) discovered in the cemetery of Orthi Petra at ancient Eleutherna in Crete. Although many more pyres, containing individual and multiple cremations, as well as a number of inhumation graves and inhumed child burials, have been found in the cemetery, S. has chosen to present the material from Pyre A separately because of the discovery not only of a cremated warrior and his companion but also of a beheaded, inhumed skeleton which, in S.'s opinion, is reminiscent of the scene described in the Iliad of the execution of the young Trojan captives at Patroclus' pyre. S. is persuaded by this and other similarities between Pyre A and Homer's description of heroic cremations that he has found sufficient proof that Homer was describing contemporary funerary practice (here dated c. 700 B.C.). After a detailed description of the pyre's contents, S. embarks on a lengthy discussion, primarily of Homer's accounts of cremation burial practices and, to a lesser extent, of late Geometric/Archaic funerary iconography, with a view to determining whether similar rituals were performed at Pyre A. The main issues addressed include the preparation and building of pyre, prothesis and ekphora, funeral feasts, libations, and the binding and slaughter of the apparent 'sacrificial victim'. However, this synthesis of specialist scholarship does not promote his cause significantly, principally because many elements of the ritual are not archaeologically traceable. Moreover, evidence such as unguent vases and the remains of feasting found at the pyre is not peculiar only to Homer and Eleutherna but occurs at a large number of sites with differing chronologies and diverse burial customs. It should be emphasized that cremation burials of the Late Dark Age and Early Archaic periods exhibited a great variety of forms throughout Greece which are not only absent from the Homeric epic but are also in contrast to the cremations at Eleutherna. So even if one assumes that Pyre A and the epic have a number of features in common, an isolated case does not alone constitute sufficient proof that Homer was describing contemporary society. In the final section S. offers alternative hypotheses concerning both the status of the warrior and his companion and the identity of the beheaded man. Although it seems a fair conclusion ?
