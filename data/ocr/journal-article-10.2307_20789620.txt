<plain_text><page sequence="1">JJQ Introduction to "Joyce and Physiology" Vike Martina Plock University of Exeter In 1899, Joyce opened his matriculation essay, "The Study of Languages," with a description of "the seven earthly sciences": a fresco in the church of Santa Maria Novella at Florence depicting the seven liberal arts "in a gradual progress from Science to Science, from Grammar to Rhetoric, from Rhetoric to Music and so on to Arithmetic."1 Inspired by the work of such scientific luminaries as John Tyndall and such eminent literati as Matthew Arnold, both of whom delivered prominent addresses on the contested topic of the relationship between literature and science in higher education in the 1870s and 1880s, Joyce sets out to vindicate the study of literature and languages. If, he argues, the image of the seven earthly sciences in the Florentine chapel suggests that Arithmetic or Mathematics represents the culmination of human knowledge, the artist also "assumes that Grammar, or Letters, is a Science" (Writing 12). Literature is, Joyce deduces, no lofty, speculative, or imaginary exercise but a precise and coherent system based on a measured symmetry of ideas, facts, and emotions?an organized and methodical compositional technique that is "ruled and directed by clear regulations, sometimes of facts, sometimes of ideas" (Writing 13). In this inclusive reading of litera ture and science, literature becomes, once more, an ennobled part of mankind's worthiest intellectual pursuit. Joyce's contribution to the late-nineteenth-century "two cultures debate" is, admittedly, as pompous and sophomoric as many of his other juvenile literary attempts, yet his interest in the topic nonethe less merits consideration. The young Joyce was extremely alert to the intellectual and cultural fads and fashions of his time?his passionate support for Henrik Ibsen's drama is a case in point?and his decision to follow in Arnold's footsteps and write an essay on the relation ship between literary and scientific learning shows that the question of how to reconcile these different forms of knowledge mesmerized many at the turn of the century. Whereas, as Gillian Beer argues, in "the mid-nineteenth century, scientists still shared a common lan guage with other educated readers and writers of their time,"2 things seemed to have changed by the time Joyce set out to establish himself as a novelist.

As Joyce explains, "a line of stern demarcation" is thus drawn "between the two" (Writing 13)?a fact provoking both ample commentary and fierce criticism from scientists and scholars such as Thomas Henry Huxley as well as Tyndall and Arnold. No wonder, then, that the young Joyce felt this topic deserved his attention. This special issue of the James Joyce Quarterly investigates Joyce's interest in the relationship between literature and the sciences. But since he opted for medical studies no less than three times (LettersI 137), his reliance on physiological matters and metaphors rightly takes center stage in the following articles?all of which situate his works at the crossroad of literature and science to illustrate the point made in "The Study of Languages" that no gulf separates the two disciplines. In Joyce's fiction, literary and scientific knowledge para digms productively meet, intersect, and share common intellectual ground. Joyce explicitly announced his indebtedness to physiological discourses and debates in the development of his literary practices when he chose the term "paralysis" to describe his fellow Dubliners and also when he allocated a body organ to most of the episodes in Ulysses.3 Consequently, from the very beginning, critics have noted the connections between Joyce's prose and physiological processes and details. Since J. B. Lyons published his pioneering study on Joyce and medicine in 1973, a number of scholars such as Florence A. Walzl, Mary Lowe-Evans, and Richard Brown have excavated further aspects of Joyce's diversified knowledge of biological and physi ological sciences.4 More recent criticism, such as Christine Froula's book Modernism's Body,5 has drawn distinctively on psychoanalytical theory to anatomize Joyce's textual corpus, and a similar commit ment to read his engagement with physiological matters and debates through a theoretical lens informs many of the essays in the 2006 col lection Joyce, "Penelope," and the Body.6 What distinguishes the essays in this special issue from previous scholarship on Joyce and the body is their contextual approach and their focus on Joyce's sociohistori cal background. What kind of medical and scientific knowledge on the body existed at the time Joyce was writing? What aspects of this knowledge did Joyce absorb? How did these medical debates inter sect with the social and cultural concerns of Joyce's time? How did Joyce develop his literary aesthetics alongside his apparent reliance on physiological metaphors? These are some of the questions that inform the articles collected here in "Joyce and Physiology." Their principal aim is to instigate new ways of thinking about Joyce's intel lectual investment in contemporary biomedicai arguments and to explore how Joyce's commitment to the scientific and physiological 432</page><page sequence="3">debates of his time relates to the surfacing of his modernist aesthet ics and to his responsiveness to the shifting political formations of modernity. Clearly, in view of more recent scholarship that focuses, like John Gordon's work, specifically on Joyce's dialogue with con temporary sciences,7 his dependence on physiological knowledge invites, or rather requires, renewed examination. It is time, in other words, to move beyond the "paralysis" paradigm, which has for so long served as an interpretative tool for Joyce's works. "Joyce and Physiology" prioritizes this more diversified approach to medical and physiological matters in Joyce's work. In "Hades," the graveyard episode in Ulysses, Bloom envisions a resurrection scenario, in which the dead frantically fumble around for dispersed organs?"lungs, hearts, livers" (Li 6.676-81)?to reassemble their bod ies in anticipation of the Last Judgment. While the contributions to this special issue compile an array of similarly heterogeneous pieces to portray a fresh picture of Joyce's work, the young Joyce's interest in medicine provides the vantage point for the first two essays in this collection. Val?rie B?n?jam's "Joyce After Flaubert: The Cuckold as Imperfect Physician, the Writer as Physiologist" illustrates how Joyce, in his own writing, drew on Gustave Flaubert's interest in and knowl edge of medical topics and themes. Her meticulously researched essay, which recovers fascinating aspects of French nineteenth-cen tury medical debates on surgery and which shows their immediacy for Flaubert's writing, offers a resolutely different perspective on the relationship between the two writers. For Joyce, as B?n?jam argues, the experiment with Flaubert's clinical and impersonal narrative tech niques was instrumental in developing his own writing practices. Ariela Freedman's comprehensive analysis of "skinscapes" in Ulysses similarly discusses the extent to which the clinical perspective of nineteenth-century medicine influenced and determined Joyce's tangled relationship with literary realism. Nineteenth-century medi cal case studies and realist literary aesthetics shared many similar goals in their preoccupation with details, facts, exact observation, and evidence. Joyce himself makes this connection when he asserts in "The Study of Languages" that science "proceeds with regular course" and represents, in the first place, "a knowledge of facts" while literature (he probably refers to realist literature here) does "in turn share in the neatness and regularity of Mathematics" (Writing 13). According to Joyce's remarks, literary engagements with physiology and the medi cal sciences always seem to necessitate a determined interaction with the factual world of bodies, organs, and diseases. Such experiences suggest a particular way of reading and of mimetically recording the material aspects of the real world. But what Freedman's animated reading of skin colors, epidermal flaws, and dermatological science in Joyce's Ulysses also shows is that such "surface readings" have limits. 433</page><page sequence="4">James Joyce Quarterly 46.3-4 2009 Joyce himself engaged in a much more complex way of representing the multilayered textures of his environment. Both B?n?jam's article on Flaubert and surgery and Freedman's essay, "Skindeep Ulysses" thus demonstrate how Joyce adds depth to this preoccupation with physiological exteriors and how he develops his own literary aesthet ics in response to, and defiance of, the medical realism of such writers as Flaubert. The next two studies, which offer close readings of specific epi sodes of Ulysses, further develop the argument that, in writing his novel, Joyce drew consistently on physiological paradigms and metaphors. In "Eating and Digesting 'Lestrygonians': A Physiological Model of Reading," Aida Yared offers a physician's perspective on the nutritional details that Joyce ingested when writing this par ticular episode. In doing this, she proposes a "physiological model" of reading that shows how the symbolic ingestion, mastication, and digestion of the Joycean text is anticipated and represented by the episode's "peristaltic movements." Thanks to her essay, which explains the minute details of digestion, a non-specialist readership can appreciate the physiological processes that function as a strong impetus for "Lestrygonians." My own essay, "Good Vibrations: 'Sirens,' Soundscapes, and Physiology," illustrates Joyce's familiarity with prominent nineteenth-century acoustic theories and shows that his exploitation of music's sentimental potential was complemented but not compromised by his reliance on the physical details of sound transmission and perception. Influenced by the work of nineteenth century scientific experts such as Hermann von Helmholtz and Tyndall, who delved deeper into the mysteries of human hearing and acoustic phenomena, Joyce incorporated references to their resonance experiments in "Sirens" to add physiological nuances to his own experimentation with words and sounds. Slightly different terrain is covered by the second batch of articles on Joyce's use of physiological matters. All of them relate his interest in specific biomedicai debates to an examination of his engagement with the cultural politics of his time. Katherine Mullin's "Menstruation in Ulysses" shows how thoroughly Joyce, in order to relegate reduc tive arguments about femininity, drew on a wide range of, at times, incompatible medical theories on women's menstrual cycles. In the face of protests expressed by feminists, medical experts such as Jules Michelet and Henry Maudsley created, in the second half of the nineteenth century, an image of women that associated them firmly with their biological functions. In spite of his youthful jests about menstruation and women's animalistic nature, Joyce, Mullin argues, had started to question such simplistic readings of the female body and mind by the time he started to write Ulysses. That Joyce remained skeptical about the merits of another con 434</page><page sequence="5">temporary physiological debate is brought to light by Mark S. Morrisson's "Their Pineal Glands Aglow': Theosophical Physiology in Ulysses/' Although Joyce's crusade concerning theosophical spiri tualism has already been documented by a number of critics,8 Morrisson adds important new dimensions to this debate by show ing how . P. Blavatsky and Annie Besant marketed theosophy as a metaphysical philosophy having a firm grounding in contemporary physiological science. Far from seeing itself as an anti-materialist practice, theosophy wanted to be understood as an alternative to the legitimate sciences of Joyce's time, and this theosophical understand ing of the body is represented and ultimately criticized in Ulysses. If, as Morrisson demonstrates, theosophy wanted to capitalize on the turn-of-the-century enthusiasm for science, Joyce shows forcefully that this particular form of scientific mysticism fell short of dealing adequately with any of the challenges of the modern scientific age. In a recent PMLA guest column, Marianne DeKoven argues pas sionately for the propagation of a "posthumanist view of animals" and the "proliferation of academic animality studies."9 It is therefore fitting that this special issue on Joyce and physiology concludes with two essays dealing explicitly with animals and animal physi ology. Although Joyce shared Stephen Dedalus's dislike of dogs, his depiction of animals in Ulysses still suggests that he was a very keen observer of their temperaments, habits, and behaviors. Leopold Bloom is first introduced through a non-human encounter with a cat, and he also lends a sympathetic ear to animals' plights on his way through Bloomsday. As David Rando's "The Cat's Meow: Ulysses, Animals, and the Veterinary Gaze" illustrates, Bloom's empathy with the animals crowding Dublin's cityscape introduces an explicit ethical dimension into Joyce's discussion of animality. Taking his cue from Jacques Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am and the work of other animal-studies critics,10 Rando first explores the limitations and the ethical predicaments that develop in anthropomorphic read ings of animals. His article also pays particular attention to the ways in which turn-of-the-century veterinary science conditioned percep tions and representations of animals, demoting them to the status of non-human other?a boundary that cannot be crossed, not even by the sympathetic and compassionate Bloom, who functions as the rep resentative of this veterinary gaze in Joyce's novel. While this separa tion between animal life and humans seems non-negotiable, Rando's reading of Ulysses also shows that Joyce creates a much more inclu sive account of animals through his representation of Rudy Bloom's silent figure in "Circe." In Ulysses, the helpless and speechless specter of Bloom's dead son acts most effectively as a representative of the non-human and thus as a reconciler of the animal-human divide. Some of the impracticalities and some of the opportunities of 435</page><page sequence="6">James Joyce Quarterly 46.3-4 2009 anthropomorphic readings of animals are further illustrated by Sam Slote's "Garryowen and the Bloody Mangy Mongrel of Irish Modernity," which focuses on the citizen's ferocious dog that threatens Bloom in "Cyclops." While Slote's analysis of the episode provides a valuable addendum to the developing corpus of scholar ship on Joyce and Irish nationalism by identifying Garryowen as a metonym for Irish cultural modernity, it also follows Rando in point ing to the problems of transferring specific human characteristics (and shortcomings) onto animals. Accordingly, Slote's essay opens with a discussion of James W. Redfield's 1852 peculiar but intrigu ing study Comparative Physiognomy or Resemblances between Man and Animals, which confusingly conflates animal and human physiologies and characteristics in an attempt to create a pedigree of unadulterated national identities.11 In Redfield's idiosyncratic physiological study, Irishmen are compared to dogs. Many of Joyce's nationalist con temporaries similarly emphasized purity of race and culture in their definition of national Irish identity. As Slote also shows, however, Joyce's imaginative depiction of the hybrid animal Garryowen?who is a true crossbreed of human and animal features and of Irish and international characteristics?offers an alternative reading of Irish national identity that is, in Joyce's view, as mongrelized or hybrid as his own writing style in "Cyclops." In addition to the above-mentioned articles, this special issue contains Jason David Hall's note "A Lead on a Dog?" which comple ments and completes the two essays on animals in Joyce's Ulysses. In his short contribution, Hall identifies a particular passage from Wilkie Collins's 1854 novel Hide and Seek as a possible source for Garryowen's performance in "Cyclops." This overlooked connec tion between Joyce and Collins reinforces Slote's argument that Joyce appreciated cross-breeding as an intellectual model. But while Hall's excavation of this intertextual relation adds another aspect to Garryowen's already mongrelized composition, it might also prompt further investigations of Joyce's reliance on Collins and nineteenth century sensation fiction. Collectively the essays included here illustrate that Joyce was, like Bloom, a committed "physiologist" (U 17.1763). They also signal that his long-standing interest in modern science remains a fascinat ing field of study that will require more attention from his critics in the future. This special issue will provide the base on which much scholarship can profitably and productively be built.
