<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CASE OF THE MISSING GODDESS Plurality, Power, and Prejudice in Reconstructions of Malta's Neolithic Past Kathryn Rountree One of the destinations most beloved by Goddess pilgrims is Malta, a small archipelago (316 square km) lying in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea 93 km south of Sicily and 300 km north of Libya. Marija Gimbutas described Malta as possessing "some of the most magnificent Neolithic temples" where rituals connected with birth, death, and regeneration were carried out by a so ciety in which "women's activities took on sacred meaning."' Buffie Johnson describes the temples as "awesome" and fabulouss," and Anne Baring and Jules Cashford say they are "the earliest and most interesting complex of megalithic temples in the world," apart, perhaps, from Stonehenge and Avebury.2 Donna Read's film Goddess Remembered opens with a large image of a Maltese "God dess statue" (fig. 1) gliding across the screen accompanied by the following voice-over: Seven thousand years ago, the first raising of crops was done with hand tools, probably by women, for we know that women developed agricul ture and the domestication of animals.

Special thanks are due to Paul Clough, Ranier Fsadni, and students in social anthropology at the University of Malta; Reuben Grima at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta; Clotilde Mifsud of Goddess Tours to Malta; and all those who agreed to be interviewed, gave me tours of the temples, or talked with me informally about the temples. Thank you for sharing your insights, wonderful hospitality, and invaluable practical help. I am indebted to my colleague and husband, Joe Grixti, who has been enormously helpful both in the field and in helping prepare the illustrations. Thanks, too, to Carol P.

The sick found comfort in the temples. It was the place of healing, the place of community. It was also the place of the oracle where one could hear the voice of the priestess, an ancient healer who gave prediction and counsel.3 The temples, which were built between 5,000 and 5,600 years ago and of which there are at least twenty-three distributed throughout the two large islands of Malta and Gozo, have distinctive, rounded chambers constructed of locally quarried limestone megaliths. The internal walls of the earlier temples were built of rubble masonry and were probably originally plastered and painted, whereas later temples were constructed entirely of orthostatic blocks. Some are decorated with fine relief carvings, often in friezes, depicting variations of spiral designs and animals, including goats, sheep, pigs, fish, and a horned bull. Temple structures include altars, benches, hearths, and what are taken to be oracle holes and libation holes. Although none of the structures are now roofed, there are indications, from the inward sloping of the upper parts of walls and from the discovery of a tiny model of a temple, that they once had arched roofs, probably of corbeled or oversailed stone slabs. The artifacts re covered from them include pottery, some animal bones (presumed to result from sacrifices), and a range of statues and figurines, many of whose morphol ogy resembles that of the temple architecture (see fig. 2).4 3 The film Goddess Remembered, directed by Donna Read, came out in 1989 as a Studio D Production of the National Film Board of Canada, and is distributed by Educational Media, Australia. 4 See D.

Here, for ex ample, is what one woman wrote to me in an e-mail circular letter after visiting the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, a remarkable subterranean temple hewn from lime stone and comprising three storeys of egg-shaped chambers and passageways connected by trilithon doorways and decorated with red ochre spiral paintings: I felt moved beyond words and I felt immense gratitude for having the opportunity to be there The power of the Hypogeum to heal and trans form felt very alive even in these mode times. I experienced the en ergy there as a profound kindness that opened my heart and flooded me with a sense of being held, loved, forgiven empowered. I left with a joyful heart and a feeling of deep longing for what I know we have lost in this modem culture.5 Pilgrims often buy small plaster replicas of the "Goddess statues" to take home as souvenirs of their journeys. Such souvenirs jostle for shelf space in Maltese gift shops with miniature Knights of St John, dolphin door knockers exquisite lace, and the usual tacky T-shirts. 5 I met this woman in the Hypogeum on one of my field trips. I, too, experienced awe and a sense of timelessness (enhanced by being undergrounderground) in the Hypogeum.</page><page sequence="4">28 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion My interest in Malta was as a feminist anthropologist who had under taken research on the Goddess movement in New Zealand for a number of years. I had a fairly clear idea about the importance of the temples for the Goddess pilgrims who visited them,6 but I wished to understand their mean ings and value for Maltese people themselves. I also wanted to know how the Goddess pilgrims were regarded by indigenous Maltese: Did the latter see their heritage as being mythologized and romanticized, or possibly misinter preted, appropriated, and colonized by the foreign spiritual pilgrims? This question seemed important in the context of ongoing scholarly debates in feminist, anthropological, and archaeological circles in relation to the God dess movement.7 Unsurprisingly, I discovered in Malta a considerable range of voices and interpretations in relation to the temples, some competing, some coexisting equably or colluding, all governed by particular agendas, values, and discursive contexts. I have discussed this range of interpretations in detail elsewhere.8 Of course the idea that accounts of the past are social products that are inevitably interested, political, and differently empowered is not new; as David Lowen thal has said, "The past we conjure up is largely an artifact of the present."9 What was especially interesting in Malta was the way in which local popular discourse and local (and foreign) archaeological discourse about the temples played out in relation to Goddess feminist discourse. The relationships be tween these discourses and among those who operate within or use them con 6 See Kathryn Rountree, "Goddess Pilgrims as Tourists: Inscribing the Body through Sacred Travel," Sociology of Religion 63, no. 4 (winter 2002): 475-96. 7 Numerous scholars have engaged with these issues.

In particular I explore some of the ways in which archaeologists have represented the Neolithic remains in various contexts and suggest that these interpretations, like the interpretations of all groups with an interest in the Neolithic material, are generated from a particular perspective-one that in this case has a gendered and secularizing bias. Within postprocessual archaeology, theoretically at least, a plurality of voices and interpretive positions are accepted and welcomed.'1 "From this the oretical standpoint," says Lynn Meskell, "the voices of feminists, ecofeminists, archaeofeminists, Goddess worshippers and pagans must all be considered as legitimate discourses and given validity alongside scholarly accounts of the past."" One archaeologist strongly committed to the postprocessual approach (indeed he was first to use the term) is Ian Hodder, director of the Qatalhoyiik Research Project in Turkey, who acknowledges that any analysis of the past, in cluding that of the archaeologist, is "a construction, an intellectualisation, an appropriation."12 Hodder is currently facilitating the establishment of displays by various interest groups, including Goddess pilgrims and local villagers, at the Qatalhoyiik Visitor Centre.13 Both Meskell and Hodder admit, however, that this kind of approach can become emotionally charged and fraught with difficulties when put into prac tice and confronted with conflicting interpretations. In Meskell's view, "In re ality archaeologists, post-processual and otherwise, are generally resistant to many alternative discourses," and "the central projects of feminism and pa ganism are often at odds with archaeology." She concludes that at present 10 "Postprocessual archaeology" is a term first used by Ian Hodder in 1985 to refer to a series of theoretical approaches in archaeology that reacted against positivist approaches and are united in an interest in social ontology (the character of social reality), subjectivity, and narrative. Appropriate lines of inquiry include the investigation of social power, structure, contradiction, social change, and gender. See Timothy Darvill's entry for "post-processual archaeology" in The Concise Oxford Dictio nary of Archaeology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). Michael Shanks says that "interpretive archaeology," which grew out of post-processual archaeology, emphasizes "the ongoing process of making sense of what never was firm or certain. This archaeology entertains no final and definitive account of the past as it was, but fosters multivocal and multiple accounts: a creative but none the less critical attention and response to the interests, needs and desires of different constituencies (those people, groups or communities who have or express interest in the material past)." See Mike Pearson and Michael Shanks, Theatre/Archaeology (London: Routledge, 2001), xvii. " Meskell, "Feminism, Paganism, Pluralism," 83. 12 Ian Hodder, "The Past as Passion and Play: Catalhoyiik as a Site of Conflict in the Construc tion of Multiple Pasts," in Archaeology under Fire: Nationalism, Politics, and Heritage in the East ern Mediterranean and Middle East, ed. Lynn Meskell (London: Routledge, 1998), 124-39. I dis cussed these issues with Ian Hodder at (atalhyiik in 2002 and have been invited to work with the research team as one of the anthropologists studying the construction of knowledge at the site. 13 See Ian Hodder, "Developing a Reflexive Method in Archaeology," in Towards Reflexive Method in Archaeology: The Example at (atalhoyiik, British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara monograph no. 28 (Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, 2000), 3-14.</page><page sequence="6">30 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion "these narratives of difference cannot be reconciled within the current disci plinary framework of archaeology."14 Hodder appears to be more hopeful, or at least determinedly committed to the preservation of space for multivocality and to a conscientiously reflexive process. He acknowledges that although archaeologists readily deal with a plu rality of interpretations at the interface between their work and the outside world, they "less easily allow that outside world to interfere into the calm ob jective world of the scientific analysis of data. But as the outside voices increase their intensity and volume, and as they become ever more sophisticated and well-informed, this monastic desire for closure is threatened."15 Hodder says that the Goddess groups at Qatalhyuik have welcomed the initiative to enable different interpretations of the evidence to be presented in the visitor center, but they have also pointed out that interpretation begins at the data-collection stage and that if archaeologists simply hand over the data to others to interpret, a bias remains. Hodder thus explicitly admits that being empowered to speak does not mean that all voices are automatically equally empowered. This ac knowledgment, along with Hodder's willingness to openly discuss and address the problem of unequal power, should be heartening-and empowering in practical terms-for the Goddess community. It will be extremely interesting to see how the multivocal display at the visitor center works out in practice and whether, if the much higher-profile (atalhoyik display in the Museum of Ana tolian Civilizations in Ankara is eventually revised, a similar commitment to multivocality will prevail. Such discussions about configurations of power involving local communi ties, those who belong to the modern Goddess movement, archaeologists, and the interpretation of Neolithic remains are pertinent to my project in Malta. I wanted to understand, first, how the temples and their associated statues and figurines were interpreted according to popular Maltese discourse. What did Maltese children grow up learning about the Neolithic? I was told a fairly uni form, though not very elaborate, story. The temples were the places where the Mother Goddess, or Fertility Goddess, was once worshiped, attended by a male priesthood that spent most of its time in and around the temples while the general populace congregated outside. (The interior of temples is quite small, but there is often a large paved area in front of them.) The Goddess, to whom animal sacrifices were made, was responsible for the fertility of crops, animals, and human communities. Supplicants approached the temples to con sult an oracle (an "oracle room" has been identified in the Hypogeum and an "oracle hole" at Hagar Qim temple) or to seek healing or fertility magic. Some temples were used in solstice celebrations (indicated by the alignment of the stones, particularly at the southern Mnajdra temple). I was told and read that 14 Meskell, "Feminism, Paganism, Pluralism," 83. 15 Hodder, "Developing a Reflexive Method," 5.</page><page sequence="7">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 31 { ?. ..-::...: . :::'.:^..:: ' Fig. 3.

(Pho tograph courtesy of National Museum of Archaeology, Malta.) on Gozo there is a legend that the temples of Ggantija were built by a Sansuna, a superwoman or giantess, who built the temples by transporting the megaliths on her head from one side of the island to the other, sustained by broad beans and honey and carrying a baby at her breast.16 As noted earlier, a range of statues and figurines have been recovered from the temples and two hypogea (one on Malta and one at Xaghra on Gozo). Some of these, such as the famous "Sleeping Lady" (fig. 1) and the "Venus of Malta" (fig. 3), are full-breasted and obviously female, but most are more stylized fig ures, with very full, rounded hips, thighs, calves, and upper arms and a rela 16 See Joseph Bezzina, Forty Legends from Gozo: Stories of Bygone Times (Valletta, Malta: Bugelli, 1991), 9; and Veronica Veen, Female Images of Malta (Haarlem, Netherlands: Inanna, 1994), 9.</page><page sequence="8">32 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion tively small fold across the chest (fig. 2). Some of these figures are depicted standing, others sitting. Either they wear skirts (pleated or fringed, like that of the "Sleeping Lady") or their legs are positioned so that their genitals do not show. The heads of these rounded, stylized figures, which are thought to have been originally fitted into the still-visible neck sockets, are not in place; some have been found separately. The replicas most commonly produced for sale to tourists (I saw them in only a handful of Maltese homes) are those depicted in figures 1, 2, and 3. When I asked the sales attendants in a number of gift shops what the figurines were called, I received the following range of replies, some of which were spe cific to particular figurines and some of which applied to the whole range: "Venus of Malta," "Goddess of Fertility," "Goddess of Love," "Fertility Idols," "Sitting Lady," "Fertility Lady," "Fat Lady" (very common), "Sleeping Lady," "Gods of Fertility," and simply "Venus" (applied to more than the statue usu ally known as 'Venus of Malta," fig. 3). Thus, with the possible exception of the rounded seated statues referred to by two individuals as "Gods of Fertility" or "Fertility Idols," all of the various replicas were explicitly designated as female. The fact that "Lady" is included in many of these names does not mean that Goddess status is ruled out for these figurines. Maltese, 98 percent of whom are Roman Catholics, frequently refer to Mary as "Our Lady." It seemed to me that when they talked about the Neolithic figurines and statues, "Lady" was similarly being used to signify a sacred female entity. I was intrigued to see that in one tourist shop a "replica" of one of the very rounded statues, which normally have a relatively small, undivided fold across the chest, had been given pendulous breasts. This seemed to be a clear case of the mold maker al tering the evidence to conform to the interpretation, apparently well estab lished in popular Maltese discourse, that the statues associated with the tem ples are uniformly female and widely thought of as representations of the "Mother Goddess" or "Fertility Goddess." A short time later I decided to examine the Neolithic material in the Na tional Museum of Archaeology in Valletta, Malta's capital. The display had been handsomely renovated fairly recently, reopening to the public in 1998 and many people had told me that it was a great improvement on the previous display. This promised to be a great treat. After talking to many Maltese about the statues and temples, hearing about them from Goddess pilgrims, and read ing about them in the Goddess literature, I was now finally going to see the ac tual "Goddess statues" for myself. As I began studying the material and carefully reading all the information panels in the display, I heard a young Maltese man explain proudly and enthu siastically to an Australian visitor that the statues in the cases were "fertility Goddesses." Then came the first of a number of surprises. As I worked my way around the extensive display (which incorporated several rooms), I discovered</page><page sequence="9">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 33 that nowhere in any of the information panels was the term "fertility Goddess" mentioned at all. Although popular explanations of the Neolithic statues con sistently refer to them as female and as representing a Goddess, the museum itself never refers to the rounded seated and standing statues (fig. 2 is one ex ample) as female and never makes a connection between fertility and these fig ures. Nor is any connection made between fertility and any of the indisputably female figures (figs. 1 and 3, for instance) in the display. Indeed, the wordfer tility is used once only in the entire display, and that is in an information panel entitled "Phallic Symbols," referring to a solitary case of small artifacts (some of which to my eye are not indisputably phallic-cylindrical objects are not necessarily phallic any more than triangular objects are necessarily female pubic). Maltese people had told me a number of times that if I wanted to know about the "Goddess statues" I should visit the museum, yet the museum's ex planation of the statues clearly did not coincide with the popular explanation. I asked myself: If these (possibly) phallic symbols can be said to be associ ated with fertility, why not also the figurines with clearly marked pubic trian gles; the full-breasted, pregnant-bellied figures (which I had read elsewhere are probably ex-votos); the "Sleeping Lady"; or even the "Venus"? Why is male ness linked with fertility but never femaleness, especially when femaleness (even if we leave out the statues without obvious breasts) is much more evident in the display? The information panel that accompanied the "Venus" (fig. 3) read as follows: "The 'Venus of Malta,' from Hagar Qim, is a remarkable rep resentation which reflects a high level of artistic achievements in modelling. In particular, the back of this figure reflects a very realistic rendering of anatom ical features." Considering the fact that so-called Venus figurines in Europe have, traditionally at least, been thought to be connected with fertility in some way (and by many to represent a "fertility Goddess"), it seemed a bit surpris ing that here a cylindrical fragment spoke of "fertility" but this figurine did not. It also struck me that the panel drew viewers' attention particularly to the back of the figure-the more androgynous of her two sides. Her femininity, per fectly obvious and rendered equally realistically on the front of the figurine, was explicitly bypassed. The third important point about the information panel is that there was no mention of the possibility of a symbolic or sacred meaning to the figurine. The explanation strips both femininity and any possible reli gious significance from her. She is not a Goddess or a priestess or even a woman; she is not even a "she." The figurine is only a fine example of artistic modeling. It was beginning to seem that the perspective of those who had cu rated the exhibition was both androcentric and secularizing.17 Not only was there no mention of fertility in connection with the female anywhere in the display, but there was also no mention of a Goddess. The term 17 The generic use of "Man," meaning men and women, and the constant reference to "cult," with its pejorative meanings, instead of "religion" throughout the display were the least of my concerns.</page><page sequence="10">34 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion goddess was used once only, and that was in connection with the figurine known popularly as the "Sleeping Lady," whose information panel included this statement: "Often hailed as a 'sleeping mother goddess,' the figure may well be an eloquent representation of Death or the eternal sleep." Note the use of lowercase initial consonants and the placement of "sleeping mother god dess" between quotation marks, indicating that this is a popular interpreta tion.18 It is contrasted with an alternative, more authoritative interpretation suggesting that the figure is perhaps a representation of "Death" (note the cap ital D), or "the eternal sleep." This alternative may of course be the (or a) cor rect one, but it again manages to strip this beautiful figure of her femininity. In the first room of the display there was a case of eight fragments of fe male figurines, seven of them showing clearly the female pubic triangle and/or breasts. The title of the information panel was "Red Skorba Figurines." Al though it is true that they are not vulval symbols as such (in the way that the artifacts in the case discussed earlier are phallic symbols) because they are fragments of whole figurines, they are all female, most with a stylized and ex aggerated genital area. Their glaringly obvious femininity goes unregistered in the generic title of the information panel ("Figurines"), and there is no refer ence to the exaggerated sexual features, only an oblique statement that "the fe male features of one particular clay statuette are highly stylised." Another case in the museum displayed a number of fragments depicting pubic triangles and some small, crudely worked, obviously female figurines, three of which have large bellies and breasts. At least one (fig. 4) has nine lines incised across her back and a very swollen vulva, strongly suggesting to me that the figure(s) represent(s) women in a late stage of pregnancy or about to give birth. About these artifacts the museum was silent: there was no information panel for this case. Along with the virtual erasure of the feminine in the interpretive panels in the Neolithic display, some archaeological writing shows another kind of andro centric bias. In 1959 John Evans, author of the most comprehensive survey of Maltese archaeological material, described the figurines noted in the preceding paragraph as "pathological," "deformed," "horribly distorted female forms" with an "abdominal tumour."19 In 1996 he still said that these figures have a "patho logical condition."20 Whether this indicates ignorance about, blindness to, or prejudice against the pregnant body, it is very much the product of a male gaze. 18 In Goddess discourse this figure is frequently referred to as a priestess rather than a God dess. It is thought that the priestess is engaged in the ritual of incubating a prophetic dream. This view has also been expressed by archaeologists.

In a paper delivered at a conference titled "Archaeology and Fertility Cult in the Ancient Mediterranean," held in Malta in 1985, in which he discussed the Maltese Neolithic and other comparative Mediterranean material, the em inent archaeologist Colin Renfrew made a comment about early Bronze Age Greek fertility figures that he said were "very rarely fat." "On the contrary," he said jauntily, "they are extremely thin, and if you prefer thin ladies it is to the Cyclades that you should turn!"21 This flippant appeal to contemporary (male) preferences for "thin ladies," embedded within a discussion of the morphology of Neolithic figurines, is both sexist and secularizing. It is like saying, "If you prefer a thin deity, go for Christianity, not Buddhism." Such comments should not, perhaps, be surprising in a society that evaluates women as objects whose meaning and value are measured in terms of their (desirable or undesirable) bodily proportions.22 21 Colin Renfrew's paper was published as "The Prehistoric Maltese Achievement and Its In terpretation," in Archaeology and Fertility Cult in the Ancient Mediterranean, ed. Anthony Bonanno (Amsterdam: B. R. Gruner, 1986); quotation on p. 126. 22 I am reminded here of a recent occasion when some seventeen-year-old boys came into my study and, seeing a shelf crammed with Goddess figurines and statues, said, "Gee, they're all so fat!" Renfrew is making the same comment in a grown-up, academic context. Nevertheless, judging by</page><page sequence="12">36 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion The issue of fatness is a constant preoccupation of both archaeological and popular Maltese discourse in relation to the statues and figurines. The very rounded stone statues (such as fig. 2) are frequently referred to as "Fat Ladies" or, by those who refuse to attribute femininity, as fat, asexual, or sexually inde terminate figures. The pejorative meanings of "fat" in contemporary society, particularly in relation to women's bodies, are painfully well known. Academic discussions constantly ponder the symbolism of fatness-trying to explain it or explain it away, being puzzled or appalled by it. Reuben Grima, in his article "Waking Up to the Sleeping Lady," writes in a tone that contrasts dramatically with the bulk of archaeological writing about the "gorgeous swelling" of the statue's hip.23 But most archaeological writing is far from positive: at best it is clinical and reductive-and it is filtering into tourist information. In one shop I saw the following label for a Neolithic statue (similar to fig. 2): "This carving represents one of the limestone artefacts of the 'Fat Lady' series found at Hagar Qim temple. The asexual, headless, obese seated statue has a hollow socket at the top which suggests that a separately worked head was inserted." I found it difficult to tie the secularized and clinical series of negatives and ab sences in this description to the figure in the shop window. I saw rounded full ness, composure, and grace, not sexless, headless obesity. Moreover, for God dess pilgrims the statue is a replica of a sacred icon, not a holiday souvenir whose value is to be measured against a brass knight or a dolphin door knocker. One could argue that, because the sex of some of the Maltese Neolithic statues is indeterminable and that of others is obviously female, there is no point noting the sex of any of the figures unless one is wishing to explore the cultural meanings of such sexed (or unsexed) representations. (There are no statues or figurines that have identifiably male characteristics.24 The "phallic symbols" are symbols only; they are not attached to figurines.) In the museum display, how ever, as I have indicated, there seems to be a tendency toward presenting the various figurines and statues from different sites and time periods as art objects and interpreting them according to aesthetic considerations rather than their possible cultural meanings. James Clifford's discussion "On Collecting Art and Culture," which deals with the vexed question of attributing aesthetic versus ethnographic value to artifacts, is pertinent here. Indeed, both categories, "art" and "culture," are strongly secular, according to Clifford. "What value," he asks, "is stripped from an altarpiece when it is moved out of a functioning church ... ? Its specific power or sacredness is relocated to a general aesthetic realm."25 pilgrims' accounts in pagan magazines, many women find it liberating to see the female figure molded in such generous proportions. 23 Reuben Grima, "Waking Up to the Sleeping Lady," Malta Archaeological Review 3 (1999): 3-7. 24 Evans, 'What Went On?" 44. 25 James Clifford, "On Collecting Art and Culture," in The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988), 226.</page><page sequence="13">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 37 One could further ask, What value, power, and sacredness are stripped when a representation of a deity is relocated to a general aesthetic realm? Whatever the Neolithic anthropomorphic figures once represented-and they probably did not all represent the same thing-it is not unreasonable to sug gest that their primary value was likely to have been a religious one, given that they were all found in the vicinity of structures traditionally interpreted as shrines, temples, or burial places. This is not to say that some of these (proba bly) religious icons were not produced by artists with remarkable abilities, or that religious and artistic values can or should necessarily be separated. I say "traditionally interpreted as shrines, temples, or burial places" in the preceding paragraph because Maltese popular discourse, tourist information, and the great bulk of archaeological writing have consistently referred to Malta's megalithic structures as temples and to the Neolithic as the Temple Pe riod. And of course the Goddess movement has also been quick to embrace the "temples." As recently as 1996, Anthony Bonanno, a prominent Maltese ar chaeologist, has talked about the "temple culture" and "temple period" and has described Neolithic society as "obsessed with its religion."26 But there are signs that, along with the "Mother Goddess," the "temples" are beginning to slip out of archaeological discourse. In the same 1996 volume in which Bonanno wrote, Evans placed the word temple within quotation marks.27 In January 2000 I was told by a lecturer from Malta's Institute of Tourism Studies that archaeologists are no longer convinced that the "temples" are, in fact, temples. This is borne out in a recent brochure put out by the Na tional Museum of Archaeology that describes Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, and Tarx ien as "examples of a complex form of architecture" and "impressive megalithic buildings [that] may have served as important focal points for the different communities of the islands." Nowhere in the brochure are the structures re ferred to as temples, and nowhere are the figurines found in the temples re ferred to as Goddesses. Rather, the structures are "some of the finest examples of prehistoric art in the Mediterranean." This is further evidence of an in creasingly secularized gaze on the part of archaeologists. The new description of these buildings, of course, begs new questions: Why were these magnificent buildings the "focal points" of prehistoric communities? Why was so much effort devoted to decorating them with symbols? Why are they shaped anthropomorphically, apparently echoing the shape of the statues found in them?28 One would assume that the reinterpretation of the Neolithic 26 Anthony Bonanno, "The Artist in Prehistoric Religious Ritual: Servant or Master?" in Pace, Maltese Prehistoric Art, 53-58. 27 Evans, "What Went On?" 39-44. 28 It is true, as archaeologists are quick to point out, that a few of the buildings are not specifi cally anthropomorphic from an aerial perspective, but these few still comprise a number of rounded chambers. Thus, the rounded shape one sees in many of the statues (similar to fig. 2) is still repeated in architecture. Fitting together stones weighing up to forty tons to create curved walls would not</page><page sequence="14">38 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion buildings is related to the reinterpretation of the statues. The following circu larity creeps in: if the "Goddesses" are no longer Goddesses, then the "temples" may not and need not be temples-and of course if the "temples" are not tem ples, this lends weight to the argument that the "Goddesses" are not Goddesses. Another example of the androcentric bias in archaeological interpretation is the designation of three fragmentary figures found at Tarxien as "priests." Cristina Biaggi has discussed this case in detail.29 The clay fragments, found in 1917, include long, pleated skirts, heads, and an arm and shoulder belonging to one statue originally 60 cm tall. Evans wrote that the sex of these figures is "in ferential, since the chest region is missing in all cases." The better preserved of the heads "impress[es] one as being that of a male, and very possibly a portrait. It may be mentioned also, in passing, that they [the fragments] were found in the inner part of the middle temple at Tarxien, the part supposedly cut off from the general public, which may be an argument in favour of their being priests."30 We see here that when any clear indication of sex is missing, the ar chaeologist assigns male status by default. Evans's assumption that the individ uals who entered the inner sanctum of the temple were likely to have been male is based not on any archaeological evidence, only on his taken-for-granted belief that such an important role must have been occupied by men; thus, pa triarchy is taken as normative in his attempt to reconstruct the past. As Biaggi has shown, the designation of the figures as priests has been highly significant, because archaeological theories about the "temple culture" and its demise have invoked a hierarchical priesthood, an elite, conservative class that controlled the religion. An "internal revolt" of this priesthood has been suggested as the reason for the collapse of the "temple culture."31 This story has been repeated so often that it has acquired the status of the most likely scenario. In fact, given that the "Sleeping Lady" has a fringe around her skirt simi lar in appearance to the "pleats" on the fragments described in the preceding paragraphs, and that this was the only evidence available to Evans of a similarly clothed figurine for which the top part of the torso was present, a more logical conclusion would have been that the fragmentary figures, too, were probably female.32 Despite this, a "priest" statue was created long ago by fabricating a have been an easy option for Neolithic builders, so it was clearly sufficiently important to warrant the effort. In my view it is difficult to deny that this rounded "egg" shape was symbolically significant in Neolithic art and architecture. 29 Cristina Biaggi, "The Priestess Figure of Malta," in The Meanings of Things: Material Cul ture and Symbolic Expression, ed. Ian Hodder (London: Unwin Hyman, 1989), 103-21. 30 Evans, Malta, 145. '3 Biaggi, "The Priestess Figure of Malta," 109. 32 Among the rounded standing and sitting limestone statues in the museum, there is one that does have a long skirt, but it is not pleated or fringed. This statue has pendulous breasts and a long rope of hair down her back. This statue is ignored when archaeologists claim that this series of rounded statues has no determinate sex.</page><page sequence="15">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 39 flat chest (and second arm) and molding it on to the skirt, remaining arm, and head. Priests then became incorporated into subsequent archaeological theo rizing. To their credit, recent publications have occasionally reproduced the fragments of the "priest" unreconstructed, that is, with the chest area missing; however, they still refer to a "priesthood."33 It should be noted that some new skirted figurines have fairly recently been discovered in excavations at the Xaghra Stone Circle, a Neolithic burial site on Gozo. A collection of peglike, schematic skirted figures (flat on all four sides) has been found, along with a unique limestone carving of two ample bodied, skirted figures joined together and seated on a couch, one holding a cup and the other cradling what appears to be a child, also dressed in a pleated skirt. Many of those in the Goddess movement interpret this figurine as rep resenting "twin Goddesses." Archaeologists Caroline Malone and Simon Stod dart describe the "two obese figures" (gender unclear) as "enigmatic" and say that it seems likely that the figurine was one of the ritual objects used by a shaman or priest.34 Clearly, contemporary archaeological discourse in Malta regarding the proper interpretation of the Neolithic evidence is a pole apart from popular discourse. The latter coincides with that of the Goddess movement, whose in formation tends to come from writings such as those by archaeologist Marija Gimbutas.35 When I spoke with two Maltese archaeologists on separate occa sions, it was obvious that neither had much time for a Gimbutas-style inter pretation. One told me that it is foreigners who "become dewy-eyed" about the idea of an ancient "Mother Goddess." The official archaeological line in Malta at present, which coincides with that of the British archaeologists who have ex cavated there alongside the Maltese, is that the bulk of the statues and fig urines are asexual and that there is no conclusive evidence that Malta was ever the matrifocal, Goddess-worshiping society that Gimbutas and others have portrayed it as being.36 33 The figurine is shown without the reconstructed chest in Bonanno, "The Artist in Prehis toric Religious Ritual," 58. However, in Bonanno's book Malta, which was produced for a tourist market, the figurine still has its flat chest (p. 42), and we are told that "the hieratic pose and wig-like hair-style, as well as the difference in style and concept from the usual 'fat' figures, suggest a repre sentation of a priest." 34 Caroline Malone and Simon Stoddart, "Representations of Death: Discoveries at the Xaghra Stone Circle, Gozo," in Pace, Maltese Prehistoric Art, 45-51. 35 There are, for example, many illustrations of and references to the Maltese material in Gimbutas's The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe (San Francisco: HarperSan Francisco, 1991). It should be noted that the Goddess movement does not conceptualize fertility in limited terms to refer only to the reproduction of life. Fertility is regarded as a much broader con cept, as the principle of creativity and transformation in the universe. Gimbutas, Carol P. Christ, Baring and Cashford, and many others have made this point. 36 See Caroline Malone, "God or Goddess: The Temple Art of Ancient Malta," in Goodison and Morris, Ancient Goddesses, 148-63.</page><page sequence="16">40 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Yet archaeological discourse in Malta was not always divorced from popu lar discourse. One archaeologist told me it has become increasingly so only in recent decades. The reasons for the shift within academic discourse appear to be bound up with an ongoing debate among archaeologists about whether there was a "fertility cult" in the ancient Mediterranean world and how the an thropomorphic figurines known traditionally as "Venus figurines" ought to be interpreted. At the "Archaeology and Fertility Cult in the Ancient Mediter ranean" conference in 1985, heated debate resulted in the clustering of opin ion around two poles: one "supporting wholeheartedly the existence of a uni versal belief in an all-pervading and all-embracing Mother Goddess-of which the fertility cult is just one, albeit important aspect-and the other questioning the very bases of that theory."37 Gimbutas attended the conference, but her paper was not included in the proceedings because "of her express wish not to have her article published along with that of another speaker at the same con ference."38 The momentum of this debate has rolled on over the years, along with a string of debunkings, as well as milder criticisms, of Gimbutas.39 I think Gimbutas has attracted not only strong criticism but also scorn and anger from many of her archaeological colleagues not just because of what they see as her flawed methods of interpretation but also because she has become identified with what is perceived as the agenda of the contemporary Goddess movement. It is true that elements of Malta's Neolithic past have been em ployed within the discourse of Goddess feminism. One might expect that the co-option of the past to support a contemporary socioreligious agenda might not be well received by academics who regard themselves as scientists, partic ularly when the agenda is a feminist one and the discipline is archaeology. Feminist archaeologists have had a hard time of it: Shelby Brown has said that as late as 1993, the "very notion of a feminist archaeology [was] not yet widely acknowledged or understood."40 But it is not only classical or male archaeologists who have criticized Gimbutas's methods and conclusions; her critics, some harsher than others, in 37 Anthony Bonanno, preface to Archaeology and Fertility Cult, v. Two people who were at the conference told me that this debate was very emotionally heated. 38 Ibid., vi. 39 See Brown, "Feminist Research in Archaeology," for a review of responses to Gimbutas. See also Conkey and Tringham, "Archaeology and the Goddess"; Tringham and Conkey, "Rethinking Figurines"; Meskell, "Goddesses"; Long, "The One or the Many"; and Naomi Hamilton, "The Per sonal Is Political," Cambridge Archaeological Journal 6, no. 2 (1996): 282-85. In 1996 the Cam bridge ArchaeologicalJournal (vol. 6, no. 2) devoted its "Viewpoint" section to articles dealing with the interpretation of anthropomorphic figurines. Of course there are also scholars from a wide number of fields, including archaeology, who thoroughly applaud Gimbutas's work. Many have published papers in From the Realm of the Ances tors: An Anthology in Honor ofMarija Gimbutas, ed. Joan Marler (Manchester, Conn.: Knowledge, Ideas &amp; Trends, 1997). 40 Brown, "Feminist Research in Archaeology," 238.</page><page sequence="17">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 41 elude feminist archaeologists themselves, among whom, Naomi Hamilton says, Gimbutas "is perhaps regarded as something of a traitor to the profession." Hamilton goes on to say that "goddesses have little place in current figurine theory, and are seen as millstones round the necks of feminist archaeologists."41 Meskell, another feminist archaeologist, has described what she calls "New Age" appropriations of the past as "simply hopeful and idealistic creations re flecting the contemporary search for a social utopia."42 One explanation for the growing gulf between archaeological and popular discourses in Malta could be simply that popular discourse has not yet caught up with the ongoing revision of archaeological interpretation. But it cannot be ignored that archaeologists began substantially changing their interpretation at the time that the Goddess movement became interested in the possibility of an ancient matrifocal, Goddess-worshiping society in Malta (and elsewhere in southern Europe). It is difficult not to conclude that the shift in archaeological opinion has occurred at least partly because archaeologists objected to the agenda of the Goddess movement in relation to the "temples," and partly be cause of archaeologists' frustration about what they regard as an exploitation of the past for contemporary purposes. The fact that these purposes are feminist and religious ones, I suspect, makes them even more difficult to accept. Within Malta there is clearly a plurality of interpretations of the Neolithic remains, yet the authoritative voice is without question that of the archaeolo gists. Interestingly, even though many local people defer to the archaeologists as the experts, they do not seem to realize that their own ideas about the "tem ples" are no longer shared by those experts. One might expect that popular be liefs will eventually be pulled closer to the authoritative interpretation-the numerous tour guides in Malta are already revising what they say about the "temples"-but it seems doubtful that the "temples" and "Goddesses" will dis appear entirely from popular discourse, at least anytime soon. I say this for two reasons. First, an interpretation that declares what the megalithic buildings and statues are not (that is, not "temples" or "Goddesses") and that is vague (they are "megalithic structures," "complexes," or "fine ex amples of Neolithic art") or noncommittal ("We cannot say what they are") contains much less narrative power and therefore less persuasive power or ap peal than the traditional popular interpretation. Second, archaeological inter pretations are by nature much more susceptible to change than popular inter pretations (which have been learned from childhood and are bolstered by traditions) and more likely to continue changing as they are challenged by and respond to other voices, as interpretive fashions change, and as more excava tion work is done. If archaeological opinion keeps changing, it will be difficult for popular discourse to have a definitive new interpretation to adopt; hence, 41 Hamilton, "The Personal Is Political," 284. 42 Meskell, "Goddesses," 74.</page><page sequence="18">42 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion the "traditional" interpretation seems likely to prevail, at least in the short to medium term. And what of the relationship between members of the Goddess movement (very few of whom live in Malta, and fewer of whom are Maltese) and archae ologists? Although Maltese archaeologists privately dismiss Goddess feminists' reconstructions of Malta's past, personal relationships between the two groups are surprisingly friendly, mutually supportive, and pragmatic. Special entry to particular sites is granted to Goddess pilgrims, and requests for various kinds of information and support are generously met despite the already overbur dened state of the museum's resources and staff. At least one Maltese archae ologist gives talks on Malta's prehistory to Goddess tour groups, and experts on the Neolithic sites have flown to the United States to give talks to Goddess en thusiasts. I was personally assisted a great deal by one archaeologist at the Na tional Museum, who, among other helpful actions, took me, along with a group of archaeology students, to Mnajdra temple before dawn one winter solstice to witness the rising sun strike a particular stone inside the temple. Intellectually they may have little time for "dewy-eyed" reconstructions of Malta's past, but archaeologists are grateful for the money donated by an Amer ican-based foundation that one of the foreign Goddess tour operators set up, which has contributed toward an education program for Maltese schools, a new archaeology laboratory at the University of Malta, chairs for the Museum of Ar chaeology's seminar hall, and other endeavors. A pragmatic symbiosis has been achieved with both sides aware of the mutual benefits of getting along despite their ideological and interpretive differences. Both are aware that they have, ul timately, a crucial shared agenda: the preservation of the archaeological sites. It seems likely, however, that this careful dance between Goddess femi nists and archaeologists in Malta may falter if the archaeologists are not pre pared to become involved in a more conscientiously reflexive approach to their theorizing and if the Goddess seems vulnerable to permanent disappearance. At present, Goddess feminists have power in terms of their financial contribu tion made directly (through donations and sponsorship) and indirectly (through tourism) to archaeological projects, but their power to voice their in terpretation of the Neolithic material is largely restricted to their own com munity and its publications. Meskell has made the point more generally: "Ar chaeologists continue to write their own narratives within their own disciplinary milieu, claiming intellectual superiority," while "Goddess-worship pers, pagans and alternative archaeologists run their own journals and publish ing houses, having little input from their institutionalised counterparts."43 At present, there seems to be little space in Malta for multivocality, at least in the sense of meaningful, mutually respectful dialogue between archaeologists and Goddess feminists. 43 Meskell, "Feminism, Paganism, Pluralism," 84.</page><page sequence="19">Rountree: The Case of the Missing Goddess 43 Both discourses are, however, represented in tourist literature. Some ar chaeologists write guidebooks for tourists and have input in the training of tourist guides, and the Goddess perspective is present in tourist literature be cause it coincides with popular discourse. Interestingly, the boundary between archaeological discourse and popular/Goddess discourse is now permeated when academics write books for the popular/tourist market. In this context they do not exhibit the same degree of reluctance to mention a "Mother God dess" that they do in archaeological discourse. In Malta: An Archaeological Paradise, for example, Anthony Bonanno writes the following about the "Sko rba figurines" (discussed earlier in this article): "The context in which they were found suggests a religious meaning, perhaps a "Mother Goddess."44 This seems to suggest that archaeological interpretation is ambivalent, flexible, and pragmatic, altering according to differing contexts and agendas. As two Mal tese skeptics (who were not archaeologists) told me, the ancient Mother God dess is "a tourist line": foreigners "like the idea of it." The archaeological per spective is similarly flexible when it comes up against a Gimbutas-style interpretation: the reaction is often to take up an antithetical position that is no less informed by a politics of gender (as we have seen in this article) than the position of Gimbutas or the Goddess movement. Just as a feminist sacralizing bias can be seen to govern Goddess feminists' reconstructions of Malta's past, a masculinist secularizing bias can be identified in archaeological interpretations. The androcentrism has long been there, but the trend toward a secularized gaze is relatively new. Archaeological interpre tations seem to me to be determinedly blind to the possibility of encountering the sacred feminine, and Goddess feminists, like all marginal groups, are re quired to be respectful, diplomatic, and adept at accommodating different ways of seeing in order to preserve what space they have. 44 Bonanno, Malta, 8.</page></plain_text>
