<plain_text><page sequence="1">29 Verbs of Praise in the LXX Translation of the Hebrew Canon Robert J. Ledogar - Maryknoll, New York Although praise is one of the most basic elements in all liturgy, it is not easy to find a clçar statement of just what it means to "praise God". In what sense should we consider praise to be " pleasing to God"? Is praise one more anthropomorphism of an ancient culture from which a truly modern liturgy should be delivered? Such questions can hardly be answered if we are unclear about even the traditional meaning of praise. The vocabulary of praise that is used in the New Testament and in the early Christian liturgy can only be understood in the light of Septuagint usage. But the Septuagint vocabulary in its turn can only be understood by comparison with its Hebrew background. This article will examine and compare a series of verbs in the Septuagint which are roughly translatable by the expression "to praise": orfveïv, àfXVSLv, è^ojjLoXoYeïa&amp;ai, sùXoyeïv, SoEáÇeiv, and some related forms of expression. Our study will be limited to those books of the Septuagint which correspond to the Hebrew canon (*). This enables us to maintain comparison with the Hebrew equivalents, and has the added advan- tage of excluding the verb which does not occur in the books under consideration and which calls for a separate, though related, treatment. The factor that is most immediately evident about all these praise verbs is their very close relationship with one another. Pairs of these words, or groups of them, frequently occur together in the same context. Thanks to the Hebrew poetic technique of parallelism, and particularly of synonymous parallelism, we can observe at a (!)

J. Iyedogar rapid glance just how closely knit the entire vocabulary of praise actually is. The table on p. 31 indicates some of the more obvious parallels. Obviously one should not try to conclude too much from paral- lelism, or even from logical juxtaposition, when dealing with a trans- lation. The translator is not entirely free in his choice of words. If è^o(jLoXoyeÏGr^ai is the word he considers best suited to render the hebrew hôdãh, and ouve tv is the word he considers best suited to trans- late hillêl, he has to put the two in parallelism whether he wants to or not, because the two Hebrew equivalents are so arranged. However, aside from the fact of the influence this willy-nilly parallelism may have on the later language, a closer examination of the translation can help to show that the Septuagint translators al- ready considered the Greek words in our group as closely related and, when used in certain contexts, practically synonymous. This is one of the aims of the study that follows. But such a study also raises the question of the basic meaning which brings these words together in such contexts. Simply defining them all as "praise" does not fully explain this close relationship. EuXoyeïv is often used with the meaning " to bless"; QjxoXoyew and e^ofxoXoyeccj&amp;ai, are used to signify both a profession of faith and an act of penance; SoÇáÇeiv sometimes denotes a wordless gesture. There must be something they all have in common which makes it possible for them to become synonymous in certain contexts. This common element we believe to be that which some commen- tators call the "forensic" element, using this expression in its wider non- judicial, sense. All our words share the character of a public proclamation. They signify something which takes place before an audience. They impart to this audience, at least indirectly, some knowledge or realization. All of our words have this character in other contexts as well, but when they come together in the context of a joyous religious festival they become " praise". The kind of praise which all of them signify, therefore, is that of joyous public proclamation (1). This may be either of God's attri- (1) We do not maintain that this is the only kind of praise found in the Old Testament. We do maintain that this is the basic meaning of praise as signified by the words in question at the time of the Septuagint translation.</page><page sequence="3">Verbs of Praise in the LXX Translation of the Hebrew Canon 31 , , SoÇáÇeiv (et: (alvei v ujxveïv e^o^oXoyeia^ai , euXoyeiv , » (8i8ovai (aiveaiç) (ôllvoç) (eÇopLoXóyYjatç » ) (euXoyia) 8o£av) (e7r)alvetv Ps 34,18 Jer 4,2 Ps^ 21,24 43,9 Isa 38,18 99,4 Ps 144,2 108,30 Pr 31,30 (aíveaiç) Ps 33,2 Ps 65,8 u(jLveïv Isa 25, 1 (fyvoç) Ps 99,4 ¿ÇojxoXoysia^ai Ps 34,18 Ps 144,10 Ps 85,12 43,9 99,4 108,30 (è^opLoXóyYjaiç ) Ps 99,4 Jos 7,19 euXoyeïv Jer 4,2 Psl44,10 Dan 4,31 Isa 38,18 Ps 144,2 Pr 31,30 SoÇáÇetv Ps 21,24 Isa 25,1 Ps 85,12 Dan 4,31 (8i8óv&lt;xi SóÇav) Jos 7,19</page><page sequence="4">32 R. J. I^edogar butes ("descriptive praise") or of His saving activity ("narrative praise") (x) or both. The point is that it is not just intended for the "ears" of God. It is meant for the çars 0f those present as well. This praise is often addressed to God in the second person, but this is because it is offered in His presence and is a public act of ac- knowledgement on the part of the one praising after the manner of a panegyric (2). The final purpose of the praise thus offered is not to "mollify" or "flatter" God, nor is it to transmit to Him some cultic "force" (3). It is to increase His "glory" in the very direct way of causing others present to recognize His attributes. This may come about either by imparting some new knowledge of a divine intervention or by causing those present to recall some salvific event of the past (4) or some divine attribute. When the psalms of lamentation, in appealing for God's help, proffer the motive: "the dead do not praise thee", they are not sup- posing that God cannot get along without their words, they are sup- posing that truth and justice simply demand that he be recognized for what he is. Ps 6,6(5): For in death there is no memory of thee (oux SCTTLV ... Ó fJLV7)(JLOV£ÓCOV &lt;JOl&gt;) In Sheol who can give thee praise?

Words in the group àyyéXXsw are found in synonymous paral- lelism with atveïv (Ps 144[145],4); s^ofxoXoy sZcr&amp;at, (Pss 29[30],10; 78[79], 13; 104[105],1); euXoysïv (Ps 95[96],2); Scovai 8ó£av (Isa 42,12). And these words are frequently found with olívzgiç as direct object (x). The group (ju[xvY)axeiv does not enter into the question as a syn- onym but rather 1) as the end toward which the activity denoted by the other verbs is directed; 2) as a factor which prompts one to break out in praise. Both of these functions are important in the act of praise as will be seen in the following citations. We here reproduce lengthy sections from three psalms as exam- ples of the relationship between the praise-vocabulary proper and these related words.

Now let us consider the verbs individually. aJvscv Aivetv is certainly the most versatile of the words in the group we are considering, and its usages show most clearly of all, perhaps, how interchangeable these words are. We will consider the word in conjunction with its compound e7raivecv because these words are already roughly equivalent in classical Greek, though certain diffe- rences should be noted at the outset. 'Etoxivelv is preferred to aivsïv in</page><page sequence="7">Verbs of Praise in the IyXX Translation of the Hebrew Canon 35 Attic prose, and, along with its usual sense of 'praise' or 'commend' it sometimes has the correlative sense of 'agree with,' 'side with'. On this and other occasions it can take a dative of the person. This dative, however, tends to disappear in the fourth century B.C. (*). Its corresponding noun, e7raivoç: 'approval', 'praise', 'commendation', also designates a complimentary address or panegyric (2). In the Septuagint etwclveiv is used much less frequently than aîveïv and when used it most often translates the hithpa* el of hll (3), while aivscv is generally used for the pi* el (4). Aivsïv, which in classical Greek belongs rather to the vocabulary of the poets, means 'to tell of' or 'speak of', and this gives the key to its usual meaning 'to praise', 'approve'. It designates praise in the sense of praise-expressed-to-a-third-party-in-favor-of, and is thus opposed to 4^Yelv: 'blame' or 'censure'. Hence it can also mean 'recommend'. The noun aïvsaiç does not occur prior to the Septuagint where it regularly translates tehillãh : 'praise' or 'song of praise' (5). In the Septuagint aiveïv regularly translates the pVel of hll ('shout with joy', 'exult', 'praise') (•). This Hebrew verb has a long history, and its origins are still much discussed. There is no doubt that at times it designated an exultant shout (7), and that at other times it was accompanied by musical instruments (8). But in passages early and late it can also mean 'relate something good about someone', 'speak approvingly of', 'recommend' (9). When the men of Pharaoh (*) J. H. MouIvTon - G.

J. Iyedogar saw how beautiful Sarah was they went and praised (yehalelû) her before Pharaoh (*). Absalom was praised in all Israel for his beauty (2). The valiant woman of Proverbs is praised by her own works (3). And so on. With God as object, it is regularly offered "in the assembly" (4). It is certainly this meaning which the Greek translators had in mind when they chose to translate with atvsiv, which they did in most, though not all, cases. When instead they chose xauxacr&amp;at, (6), or èyxoifjuáÇeiv (8), the public nature of the act is no less evident. Even clearer is their understanding of the noun tehillãh which was rendered most often by aívecriç but also by ufxvoç (Ps 64 (65), 2), xa¿xv)fxa (Jer 13,11; 17,14), ¿ped) (7) (Isa 42,8.12.21; 63,7), 8ó£oc (Isa 61,3), Tà ëvSoÇa (Isa 48,9). The translator of Isaias even felt justified in paraphrasing the word to read tÒ acomqpiov xupiou euoLyyz- Xiouvtocl (Isa 60,6). But ocivetv is not restricted to translate hillël. It renders hôdãh seven times (8), bèrêk once (9), and the Aramaic šbh four times in Daniel (10). It appears very often alongside è^o[i6koyzÍG^&lt;x.i and is obviously so close in meaning to it that the translator of 2 Chron. 6 could render hôdãh by è^ojxoXoy eïa&amp;ai in verse 24 and by atveiv in verse 26, while the translator of the identical Hebrew passage in 3(1) Kings 8, 33-35 used e^ojxoXoYstcr&amp;ai in both places. The Hebrew noun tôdãh, furthermore, is sometimes translated è£o[i.oXÓYy)fftç but even more frequently aïveaiç and in Ps 68(69), 21 we find in the very same verse and in parallel phrase atveïv as trans- lation of hillel and a ïveaiç as translation of tôdãh . One can only conclude that the words are practically equivalent (u). i1) Gen 12,15. (2) 2 Sam 14,25. (3) Prov 31,31. (*) Pss 107,32; 109,30 (6) E.g.: Ps 48(49), 7. («) E.g.: Prov 27,2; 28,4.

In classical Greek usage the noun ujjivoç from which it is formed is sometimes distinguished from syx&lt;¡&gt;[¿iov as being reserved for divine praise (3). Primarily the verb takes the accusative and means 'to sing of', 'to celebrate in a hymn', 'to com- memorate' . In itself, therefore, it does not mean 'to sing to'. Its direct object is that concerning which a hymn is sung. Similarly it can also mean 'to descant upon', 'tell over and over again', 'recite'. It can also take a cognate accusative: 'to sing a hymn, etc.', and in this form easily lends itself to the use of a dative such as in Isa 42, 10: ûfxvyjcraTs t¿5 xupíco öfxvov xatvóv. Finally, it is found intransitively simply as 'to sing', 'to chant' (4). Its use in the Bible is in perfect conformity with these different meanings. It is used sometimes transitively, sometimes intransitively, no matter what Hebrew verb it corresponds to. In the intransitive form it renders Sir (6), 'to sing', but it also translates words for shouting (rãnan) (•) and singing (zimmer) (6) where the sense is clearly that of proclaiming a message. Interestingly enough, it is used to translate the hiph'il participle of yd': 'to know' in 2 Par 23,13 (môdiîm lehallèl : ufxvouvTsç aïvov), though it may simply be that the Hebrew phrase was as obscure for the Septuagint translator as it is for most modern commentators (7).

Iyedogar èjjioXoy etv - èlojJioXoyecafl-ac - àvd-ofxoXoYscafrac A. ó¡JioXoyecv With this word-group we come closest of all, perhaps, to the basic notion of praise which unites all the words we are considering f1). The verb ¿(JLoXoyetv appears but seldom in the Old Testament, but since its compound etzoyLoXoysLcdm is not found prior to the time of the Septuagint, it is an important key to the understanding of the latter. ó[xoXoyeLv occurs frequently from the 5th century B.C. onwards (2). Its basic meaning is that signified by its components 6[xo- and XoyeZv, 'to agree with, say the same thing as' (3). From here it takes the sense 'to correspond', 'agree with' - whether of persons or things, these latter being in the dative case. Secondly it means 'to agree to' a thing, 'to grant', 'to concede' and hence - but only in authors later than the Septuagint - 'to avow', 'admit' or 'acknowledge' with the complement in the accusative case. Thirdly, it means 'to agree', 'to promise', again with the accusative (4). At a relatively early period, however, the verb does occur in a sense close to the second one above: 'to avow', except that it never takes a direct object in the accusative. It is found with an infinitive: ó(i.oXoyéco aè áSixetv (I confess that I am wronging thee (5) ôjxoXoyeïv oůx etSévat (to confess ignorance) (6) and sometimes this infinitive is replaced by 'a clause introduced by (7).

B. àvô-ojJLoXoYstafl-ac 'Av&amp;ofxoXoYsta&amp;ai shows a similar evolution. Properly it means 'make a mutual agreement or covenant* (1) but later comes to mean 'confess freely and openly' as in the historian of the first century B.C.

C. è^opioXoystafl-ac ê^ofJLoXoysïa^ai, is found frequently in the Old Testament as the regular equivalent of the Hebrew verb hôdãh. The Greek word in its compound state has the ordinary meaning 'to admit openly', 'acknow- ledge', and is found especially in legal formulae in the papyri (8). But we have no examples of the word earlier than the Septuagint, so that it is only with caution that we may contrast Septuagint usage and that of "profane Greek". Two facts are nevertheless remarkable: 1) è£o[xoXoY£Ïa&lt;Bm never occurs with the meaning 'praise' outside the Bible. 2) The Septuagint translators, who regularly use i^oiLÓXoyziaům to translate forms of ydh, generally choose èÇocyopeusiv when the context is penitential and the meaning is that of confession of sin (4). c{;o(ju)XoYeta&lt;9m is used for the confession of sin only in Daniel (*).

Ledogar will be met with again occasionally, however, in the New Testament and in other Christian literature. In his very thorough discussion of this word-group, O. Michel says (*) that the use of e^ofAoXoyeicr&amp;ai (and ¿(xoXoyeïv) in the sense of 'praise' constitutes a true Hebraism. This is probably true (2), but the proper Greek meaning of the word is also a valuable key to what the .Hebrew notion of praise was. The fact that the translators used è£o|xoXoYsïa&amp;ai to translate hôdãh and sometimes other praise-words, indicates that for them the act of praise was at the same time an open acknowledgement, a revealing, a making public of something that concerned God. It is because of this, first of all, that the act of praise and the act of confessing one's sins come very close to one another. And because of this it was easy for the translators: 1) to use the verb é^o'iokoy¿ÍG^oii to translate other praise- words such as hillěl (3); 2) to use other Greek verbs to translate hôdãh [(aíveiv, 7 times (4); U(xvstv 4 times (6); euXoyew twice (8); 3) to translate the substantive tôdãh (7) sometimes with èÇofAoXóyrçoriç but even more regularly with (*) TWNT V, 204, 1.18.

Redpath, A Concordance to the Septuagint [Graz 1954]) gives it as equivalent of hillël in 1 Par 23,30 and 2 Par 5,13a, but this may be explained by sim- ple metathesis. In 2 Par. 20,21 it is certain that exomologeîsthai does not translate hôdãh the first time it occurs in this verse, but it is not certain what it does translate.

In Esd 10,11 the context is definitely penitential and only the double sense of 'confession' can explain what this text might have in common with such (roughly) contemporary uses of the word as 2 Chron 29,31; 33,16 and Neh 12,27fí., where the context is obviously one of praise. 2) The expression 'al tôdãh in Lev 7,12 indicates that the more exact translation of zebach-tôdãh in Leviticus is a "communion-sacrifice accompanied by praise". This is the translation used by M. Cazeu.ES in the Jerusalem Bible: "sacrifice de communion avec louange". In this he agrees with B. D. BERDMANs, A. R. HuivST, and J. H. Hospers (see the latter's review of Hurst's Belijden en Loven in Bibliotheca Orientalis 5 [1948] 145). W. B.

Hebraism though it may be, therefore, the word does not thereby lose its proper Greek sense of a public acknowledge- ment when taken over by the Bible. It rather takes on the special possibility of being used in a joyous, and sometimes musical, context, and, to some degree, prefers such a context. Then one must also point out that the confession of sin in the Old Testament was conceived of as an act that "justified" God and gave him glory, and thereby came close to being itself an act of praise. But it is not necessary to treat this entire question (2). It is the public proclamatory character of the praise act that we wish to emphasize here. In an early study of the Septuaginťs Psalm text, M. Flashar (3) remarked how the Greek translator rendered the word hôd (= splen- dor) in four cases by the noun èÇo^oXóyYjaiç (4). Obviously there was some confusion here with hôdãh (= confess). Flashar thought that this confusion was deliberate, however. He remarked that our trans- lator knew very well the real meaning of hôd because in Ps 20,6 he 1950], p. 488) says: " Tôdãh (praise), if it ever denotes a kind sacrifice which is very doubtful, means ... an folah or a Zebach offered as an expression of praise or to the accompaniment of praise". 3) The L,XX translators rendered the word by such a variety of expressions (for a convenient list see the tables at the end of R. K. Yerkes, Sacrifice in Greek and Roman Religions... [London 1953]) that it could hardly be conceived of as a technical term. The most frequent word used to trans- late tôdãh is ainesis, the very word most commonly used in the IyXX to render tehilläh. Though in the Bible itself this term does not seem to have been a technical term for a particular sacrifice, the evidence of the Mishna would indicate that it had taken on a technical significance prior to the destruction of the temple, though it is difficult to determine its exact nature; e.g.: ShevxCoth II, 2; Zebahim V, 6; Menahot, passim. But see also the Babylonian Talmud Shevu*oth 15a: "We learnt: the two thanks- giving offerings (tôdot) which are mentioned (in the Mishnah) refer to their loaves and not to their flesh."

I/edogar translated it with Só^a, in Ps 8,1 with [xsyaXoTupeTreia, in Ps 144,5 with áyioaúvT), and in Ps 44,4 with capaiórrçç. Those four places where he uses è^o(i.oXÓY7]criç, however, indicated to Flashar that the translator had a special interest in this word. And he concludes that he wished to place special emphasis on the public, vocal character of the praise offered to God. His praise is also confession. If Flashar 's interpretation is true, it may be that the Psalter was responsible for the use of this word in other Septuagint translations. But the basis for this emphasis on the word's public significance was not simply in the fancy of the translator. Its basis was in the Hebrew original, in the word hôdãh itself. The translator's choice of words was basically in conformity with the spirit of the original. Abundant evidence of this is offered in the tables of paral- lelisms and in the number of times that êÇofxoXoyetcj&amp;ai-Â^ãA depicts an act accomplished "in the assembly" and "before the nations" (*). Also significant in this regard are the parallel expressions "praise his name" and "praise his memory", which would be better translated, perhaps, as: "give praise for his name's sake", "give praise for his memory's sake" (2). It is certainly true that the name of God often means simply God's person in Old Testament usage, but this is not always so. It also means God's reputation, his honor, just as we speak in English of a person's "good name". This sense of the word is quite frequent in post-exilic Hebrew usage and appears in parallel with both kãbôd (3) and tehillãh (4). It is also a common meaning of the Greek 6vo[xa in profane usage (5). Especially important is the equivalence between 'name' and 'memory' indicated by such texts as Deut 9,14; Jos 7,9 and especially Job 18,17: "His memory perishes from the earth and he has no name in the street".

Though it may be lengthy and somewhat awkward, the most exact rendering of the verse would seem to be: "Let them confess in the Lord's honor his mercy and his wonderful works...". This is a perfectly acceptable meaning both for the Hebrew and the Greek. We have a similar case in the oft recurring refrain èÇofi.oXoyeia&amp;s tco xupico otl áyoc&amp;óç.

The verb So £dc£stv presents special difficulties because of its relationship to the noun 8ó£ot and the polyvalence of the Hebrew word kãbôd which the latter usually translates. The word $ó£oc has been abundantly studied (3), notably in terms of its special usage in St. John's Gospel and St. Paul. It is often presented as a classic example of semantic change produced in a Greek word by reason of its use in the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament. It is certainly not within the scope of the present study to review the entire question. Briefly, the problem is posed as follows: 8ó£oc in classical Greek means 1) opinion, 2) renown (honor), 3) expectation (4).

This third sense of kãbôd is very frequent in the Old Testa- ment. It often has a connotation of luminosity, plays a special role in the theophany accounts, and thereby takes on considerable theo- logical implications. The Greek noun So£a, however, is never used in such a sense prior to the Septuagint. It is nevertheless used in nearly all instances by the Septuagint to translate kãbôd and often certain other words with a similar meaning of splendor or magnificence. In later Jewish- Greek writings and in the New Testament this even becomes the most frequent sense of the word. The phenomenon is striking and no fully sufficient explanation for it has as yet been offered. It is still not very easy to conceive of a translator who deliberately changes the sense of a word in the lan- guage into which he is translating. This is tantamount to deliberate obscurity. It is more probable that the word underwent a gradual evolution of which we have no evidence. The decisive factor in such an evolution would be the entrance of the word for the first time into a religious context, be this pagan or Jewish. At any rate, many commentators are so taken up with the dif- ference in sense of the two words that they tend to obscure the meaning they have in common, that of 'honor' or 'renown' (2). This is due, in part at least, to the concentration of interest on the noun SóÇa to the detriment of the verb So (3). To some extent this verb, being denominative, underwent a similar transformation, but this actually took place in the Septuagint in only a very few cases (4). i1) Gesenius - BÜIII,, 355. (2) G. Kitted, for example, says: "dóxa, gloria, Ehre, die einem Menschen erwiesen wird, Ruhm, ist in den at. liehen Büchern zumeist selten. . (TW NT, II, 246), and yet the canonical books alone offer some forty examples. In a footnote he adds, quite arbitrarily: "Nur schein- bar und äusserlich ordnet sich hier die Beziehung auf Gott ein, dem der Mensch 'die Ehre gibt'; in Wirklichkeit gehört aber die Redeform in den Zusammenhang der göttlichen und daher in eine andere Ebene des Be- griffes" . (3) Helmuth Kittel's otherwise very thorough work, for example, considers doxázein in its section on the New Testament, but for the Old Testament treats only of dóxa. (4) It is certainly an exaggeration on the part of G. KiTTEi, when he says: "Das von doxa abgeleitete Verbum hat an der eigentümlichen Sprach- geschichte dieser Vokabel vollen Anteil". (TWNT II, 256 f.).</page><page sequence="18">46 R. J. I^edogax 'Give honor to', 'render public homage to' remains by far the most frequent Septuagint meaning of 8o£áÇeiv, and this corresponds quite closely with the word's second sense in non-biblical Greek: 'to magnify', 'extol', 'hold in honor' (1). Once this fact is made clear, it can be shown that this verb is in many instances practically interchangeable with the other verbs we are considering, and that, at these times, it shares with them the fundamental meaning 'to acknowledge publicly', render public homage to'. Its special nuance is that it is not always 'vocal. It may signify an action without words. Ao^áÇeiv occurs 66 times in the canonical books of the Septuagint. It translates forms of kbd 29 times, mostly pi* el (2). In the remaining 37 cases it translates no less than 13 different Hebrew verbs, some of which are quite rare. Of all these, there is only one incontestable passage where So^áÇeiv takes the meaning of 'to be resplendent'. In chapter 34 of Exodus the word is used three times to translate qãrãn , a word which occurs nowhere else in the Bible and which Jerome himself misunderstood to mean 'have horns' (3). In the eight cases where SoÇáÇeiv translates pe'èr or tipWereth (4), one may be permitted to see an influence of the * kãbôd- splendor' notion, given the possible connotation of ornament contained in these words. As a matter of fact, however, a sufficiently good sense is given when one translates SoÇáÇeiv by 'give honor to' or 'obtain honor, re- cognition for' (6). P) Liddeu* - SCOTT, 444. (2) qal : once Isa 66,5; niph'al seven times; I^ev 10,3; 2 Kgs (2 Sam) 6,20; 6,22; Ps 86(87), 3; Isa 43,4; 49,5; Ezek 39,13. (8) Ex 34,29.30.35. (4) In two of these cases, Isa 4,2; 60,13, the translation is free and the equivalence doubtful. The other cases are (2) Esd 7,27; Isa 10,15; 44,23; 49,3; 55,5; 60,7. (6) All but one of these instances are in Isaias. The special inte- rest' of the Isaias translator in dóxa to which L. H. Brockington (VT 1 [1951] 23-32) calls attention is evident in several passages, but it is not at all sure that this interest is uniquely in the direction of the doxa - kãbôd theme. The universalista of such passages as Isa 55,4-5 (cf. Isa 61,8-11) may be a sufficient explanation. In her unpublished dissertation on the words for rejoicing in the Old Testament Dorothea Ward Harvey very pertinently says (p. 213), "The word praise is very close to the center of Second Isaiah's whole stress on the demonstrative force of God's action in redeeming Israel".</page><page sequence="19">Verbs of Praise in the I/XX Translation of the Hebrew Canon 47 But we need not contest every single passage here. It suffices to note: 1) SoÇáÇeiv is not reserved for 'glory' given to God (1). Nor is there any change of sense between those instances where God is object and those where someone else is object. This is evident from I Sam. (I Kings) 2,30: "I honor those who honor me", says Jahweh, and the Septuagint translated by XoÇáÇsiv twice. 2) Those passages where kbd-pi el are translated by Tifxav rather than So^dcÇeiv do not signify, as G. Kittel would seem to suggest, a tendency on the part of the Greek translator to avoid using SoÇáÇsiv in the sense of 'give honor to' (2). An examination of the passages in question (3) shows that in most instances the honor to be given takes the form of a material gift. In such instances tijjwcv, a denominative of Tifryj which means a 're- ward' is the natural choice. When we understand 8o£dc£eiv in the less material sense of a public testimonial of recognition, aimed more at giving the person a good name (Só£oc) than at enriching him, this distinction is quite understandable. 3) This sense of the verb is ren- dered quite clearly in passages such as 1 Kings (1 Sam) 15,30. Samuel has just told Saul that God has rejected him. But Saul says: "I have sinned; yet honor me now (SóEaaóv fi.s 8r¡) before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me that I may worship the Lord your God". Samuel accepted, and by appearing with him in the Sanctuary confirmed Saul's authority (4). It is evident in this case that 8oí;áÇsiv does not necessarily stand for any special interior attitude. Samuel 'honored' Saul in spite of his (and Jahweh's) personal attitude toward him. It is the public act that is essential. Quite instructive for the sense of 8o£áÇeiv is the Greek translation of the Song of Moses in Exodus 15. The verb appears five times in this short passage (not counting SóÇoc and which also appear) as translation of three different Hebrew verbs, none of which is kbd (6). This translation is doubly important because it would seem to have (*) E.g. Jg 13,17; 1 Par (1 Chron) 19,3; Ps 14(15), 4; 90(91), 15; Dan 2,6; Esth 3,1; etc. (2) Kittel says this only of the noun (TWNT II, 246, 11. 25-32) but that is equally misleading.

The use of the passive here, even if it is to be taken in a middle- voice sense (6), would seem to confirm this interpretation. God is going to "get" himself "glory", as the Revised Standard Version correctly renders the Hebrew niptial of kbd here (6). Through the destruction of Pha- raoh and the deliverance of Israel He will make known Who He is (7). (x) Iv. H. Brockington, art. cit., (p. 44, n. 3), p. 23.

And when, two lines further he translates "and I will praise (nwh) him" by 8o£oc&lt;t6&gt; ocutov he understood that the singer intended to add to this new state of things. In the second case the word So^áÇeiv has the same public character as in the first, only there it was by deed and here it is by word or by shouts. God is always 'glorified' in the presence of a third party, be it Egypt, all the Gentiles, or even Israel itself. This is equally true of the word's use elsewhere, particularly in Isaias. ôóçol - honor We must finally make mention of those cases where the noun SóÇa itself means 'honor', 'reputation', 'good name', 'renown', etc. In these cases 'to give glory' (Scovai 8ó£av) is practically interchangeable not only with 'glorify' (So^á^co) but also with the other verbs: atvstv, Ufxveïv, sùXoysïv, êÇofxoXoyEi&amp;craL Particularly significant are certain passages where the expression is used in a penitential context and thereby demonstrates its close affinity with é^ofAoXoyeïcr&amp;at,. It is here more clearly than anywhere else, perhaps, that we can see how the notion of 'rendering public' is the basic semantic link between the different praise-words we are considering. Josue 7,19 and 1 Kings (1 Sam) 6,5 present two parallel situations. The community has fallen upon bad times. There is some bearer of bad luck in its midst which must be exorcised. The divinity or its representative is interrogated and the source of the trouble localized. But it is not sufficient just to get rid of the bad omen, there must be a public avowal in order that God's honor be restored, and this public avowal is itself designated by the expression SiSovou So^av. Furthermore, in the case of Jos 7,19, 8o£a is used alongside èÇofxo- Xóyiqaiç in evident parallelism. Josue says to Achan, the man found guilty: Biblica 48 (1967) 4</page><page sequence="22">50 R. J.

We should note that this avowal is not demanded in order that Achan might save his life. He is killed anyway. It is God's honor that must be vindicated (x). Further, in case one might object that the Greek here is just a slavish translation of kãbôd , we find the same expression 86re Só^av xupíťp in a similar penitential context in 2 Par 30,8 where it trans- lates: tenú yãd l'yahweh. SóÇa is used in the sense of 'honor*, 'renown' in several other texts well distributed throughout the Greek Bible and therefore most cer- tainly the rendering of more than one translator (2). It has this sense not only when translating kãbôd , but also as translation of tehillãh (s), *oz (4), tifih'ereth (*). The 'glory' spoken of in these texts is not some inherent static quality in God which He reveals in theophanies, it is something which He gets: "My glory I will not give to another" (•). But it is not pas- sive knowledge either, it is 'admission', 'recognition' (7). eòXoY5^ The table of parallelisms at the beginning of this section would indicate that the verb eùXoyeïv and the verbal adjective eòXoyyjTÓç have a meaning quite close to that of the other praise-words we are (!)

If we add to this the fact that euXoyetv (euXo-pr]TÓç) translates forms 6f ydh (*), hll (2), and kbd (3) we must conclude that it was, in certain instances at least, practically synonymous with the verbs more commonly used to translate these Hebrew words (4). And it is our contention here as elsewhere that the element com- mon to all these words is that of a public act of recognition and pro- clamation of God's saving activities or qualities. This public character of the praise act is shown by: 1) Explicit statement: 1 Par 29,10: xod euXóyrçaev tov xúpiov CVC07C10V ty)ç sxxXyjctíocç Xéycov, 'EuXoyTjTÒç zL xúpie Ps 67 (68), 27 (5): èv sxxXrjaíaiç suXoyeÕTS tov &amp;eóv. 2) Parallelism with words such as euoLyyeKÍZza&amp;oLi whose public character is evident: Ps 95(96), 2: euXoyvjcraTe tò fivojxa aoTou, euayye- XíÇea&amp;e ... to aconqpiov auTou. 3) The use of the word in other passages of the Bible, and nota- bly when placed in the mouth of non-Jews. Jethro, Melchisedech, Hiram, the Queen of Saba, all 'bless' God as a result of a divine inter- vention which they have witnessed (#). In all four cases we note: a) that the 'blessing' is not an act of 'thanksgiving' for a favor received. The persons in question received nothing themselves; b) that it in- volves no profound adoration or interior conversion. Hiram and the Queen of Saba are not portrayed to us as having become Jews as a result of their experience. What these 'benedictions' involve is a public avowal on the part of gentiles that they have been forced to recognize the unique power of Jahweh as manifested in the blessings he bestowed on his chosen people. This is most evident in the excla- mation of Jethro: "Blessed is Jahweh who has delivered you out of H Isa 12,1. (2) Isa 38,18; 64,11. (8) Isa 25,3; 43,20. (4) In certain ot these passages, especially Isaias 12 and ¿8, tne in- consistency of translation may be explained by the possibility that these passages were already being used in the liturgy of the Greek-speaking Synagogue. But still, such a variance with the Massoretic text would indicate that the words in question were practically interchangeable. (6) Cf. Ps 25(26), 12.

Now I know that jahweh is greater than all gods...". 4) The use of the word in profane Greek. Literally euXoyeïv means 'to speak well of', which naturally implies an audience other than the person being praised. From here we have the sense 'to deliver a panegyric upon' p). The most natural assumption is that the Septuagint translators had this sense in mind when they chose euXoyetv as the word to translate brk. This choice presents a problem similar to that of SoÇáÇeiv: the Greek word in its classical usage corresponds to only one of the senses of the Hebrew word, and yet it is used to translate the latter in its other senses as well. Brk in the Bible signifies very often the communication of a blessing, i.e. a state of fecundity and prosperity, by God to man. We have only one instance in classical Greek where eoXoyeïv depicts something the gods do for man: xai yá¡v tòv OfocXsouç ye yevvaïov toxov &amp;eot .... euXoyoõaiv è|i,&lt;pav&amp;ç (2), and even here the use of the adverb sfi/poc v&amp;ç shows that the sense is still that of a public testimonial of honor. Certainly such a meaning does not exhaust all the riches of the beràkàh which God communicates to His people throughout their history. But before insisting on how different the Hebrew word is from its Greek equivalent we should first inquire into what the words have in common. When we do, we find that the common element is the notion of public honor, testimonial, rendered to someone. This notion is far from absent in the Hebrew berãkãh even when it is uniquely something bestowed by God upon man. When a man receives a blessing, his 'honor' is thereby necessarily increased. This is seen in that most fundamental of all blessings in the Old Testament, the blessing promised by Jahweh to Abraham (Gen 12,1-3) (3) And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (*) Liddeu, - Scott, 720. (a)- Euripides, Supplices , 927.

And it is even clearer in those texts where men 'bless' other men, or 'call' other men 'blessed': e.g., Judges 5,24 (1). The principal difference between the Hebrew brk and the Greek euXoystv is that the Hebrew word is more closely related to an inner state of fruitfulness or fecundity (2) which can be generalized to signify any increase in life-force or power (3). But it is instructive to note how the bestowal of this blessing - life-force is often accompanied by an act of "praise" toward God which uses exactly the same word: òrft(4). This "two-way traffic" (6) in the use of brk has excited the curiosity of many authors and produced strange and conflicting theories which range all the way from Mowinckel's, that the cultic blessing "creates" the power by which God thereafter blesses the community (6), to that of Van Imschoot, that in those expressions where God is 'blessed' the word has completely lost its primary sense (7). It would seem, however, that at the present time a certain consen- sus has been reached among most exegetes that when a man 'blesses' God he "proclaims that God is the source of all blessing" (8), or, to use the expression of Murtonen, he acknowledges God as "the embodi- (*) Cf.

Bãrukh Jãhweh does not mean 'blessed be God' but rather 'blessed is God'. (a) It is not a wish but rather a declaration (3). Even more than a declaration, it is a ' 'confession" (4). God's action in the life of this people seems to demand some sort of public recognition, be it a punishment as in the case of Jos 7,19 and 1 Kings (1 Sam) 6,5, or be it a blessing, it must be "confessed" in order that the "glory" be given to Him and to no other (6). Hence we see how easily the words 'to praise', 'to glorify', 'to confess' as well as 'to bless', while each possessing its proper signifi- cation, come very close to one another in certain contexts to the point where they are practically interchangeable. This was already true in the Hebrew Bible (•). It is equally true of the Greek. As a matter of fact, euXoyeïv in classical Greek is already found very close to £7uaiveïv and û|xvsïv: ItoxÍvolç euXoyo¿[xsvov néSov (7); ůfxvYjcrai ... Sí euXoytocç SiXoo (8). The favorite form for the blessing-exclamation in the Bible is the participle bãruk. It is used both of men and of God. But the Septua- gint in many instances makes a distinction when translating this par- ticiple. In Gen 14,19-20, for instance, God is euXo*Y7)TÓç but Abraham is euXoY7)[iivoç. The former, a verbal adjective, expresses a quality; the latter, a perfect participle, expresses a result. Abraham is the recipient of a blessing, while God is "bless-éd" (•). (*) A. Murtonen, art. cit., (p. 53, n. 2), p. 175. (8) Cf. the parallel case of Long live the King! : P. A. H. DE Boer, "Vive le Roi!", VT 5 (1955) 225-231. (s) Bickerman, art . cit., (p. 53, n. 2), a. 527. This is fairly easy to see in the case of the participle qal : bârûk , which can easily signify a state or condition. But the active pi1 el is also used when man 'blesses' God: Gen 24,48; Deut. 8,10; Jos 22,33; Neh 8,6; 9,5; and often in the Psalms. However, a comparison of Gen 24,48 with Gen 24,27 shows that "I blessed Jahweh" means the same as "I exclaimed: 'blessed is Jahweh' ". The same is true of 1 Chron. 29,10. 1 Kings 10,9 and Job 1,21 present more of a problem, but the Septuagint translators were careful to use the perfect participle here. (4) J. Hempen, "Die Israelitische Anschauungen von Segen und Fluch...", Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 79 (1925) 20-110, especially p. 90. (8) Isa 42,8; 48,11. (•) Isa 42,8; 48,11.

(9) "worthy of blessing"?</page><page sequence="27">Verbs of Praise in the IyXX Translation of the Hebrew Canon 55 Philo makes considerable fuss over this distinction (*), and the New Testament observes it scrupulously, but it does not solve the problem of the verb euXoyeiv which is used with both God and man as object, and often enough both together in succession. What is more, the Septuagint itself does not always adhere to this distinction (2). Syntactically, euXoyetv differs from e^ofxoXoyeta&amp;ai in that it is regularly followed by a relative clause introduced by 6 ç rather than by a (causal? completive?) clause introduced by oti. This seems to be simply a carrying over into Greek of the Hebrew preference for ahr over kì in this instance, since the use of all forms of brk with God as object probably imply the affirmation bârûkh Jahweh. Preference is given to ašer because ;t can serve both as pronoun and conjunction, and thus fit the participle better (8). The meaning in each case is parallel. Conclusion As stated in the beginning of this article, the study of the verbs used in the Septuagint to signify the act of praise reveals a common semantic element which enables these verbs to be employed almost interchangeably in that joyous religious context which we speak of as 'praise'. This element is one of public proclamation of the deeds or qualities of the person being praised. The result intended by such public proclamation is the increase in that person's 'glory'. This glory consists in an increased public knowledge or appreciation of the qualities or deeds announced, either by imparting some new informa- tion or by recalling something previously known. This result is modest enough, but it has definite implications for the understanding and conduct of Christian worship. If it can be shown, as I think it can, that this fundamental public quality has remained attached to the act of divine praise down through New Testament times into the ages when the essential forms of our worship were being solidified, then we too must understand liturgical praise in a similar way. The double goal of worship as presented several times i1) Migr., 108. (2) E.g., Gen 12,2. Perhaps the verbal adjective is chosen here to signify that Abraham will be a source of blessing for others.

I^edogar in the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy of Vatican Council II: the glorification of God and the sanctification of men, must be seen as one goal. The 'definition' of the glory of God given in the Council's Decree on Priestly Life and Ministry must be applied (as that decree quite clearly states) to the glory given in worship as well: "That glory consists in this: that men knowingly, freely, and gratefully accept what God has achieved perfectly through Christ, and manifest it in their whole lives" (A). This understanding of liturgical praise should be brought to bear especially upon that most fundamental of all praise formulae, the eucharistie anaphora which we call the Canon of the Mass. If our eucharistie praise is to further the glory of God by way of hearing, understanding, and response, then the implication as to the manner, and the language, of the Canon's execution should be clear enough.
