Patrick Wayne State University QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTIONS of the human lower torso skeletal configurations for typical automotive seated postures have not been available. Accord- ingly, there has not been a suitable biomechanical basis for defining this portion of an anthropomorphic dummy design. The pelvic orientation of the vehicle seated dummy may be significantly different from that of the human. This would adversely affect the biomechanical fidelity of the dummy's performance. The initial orientation of the pelvis, and the manner in which it is coupled to the upper torso and femurs are obviously important parameters governing lap belt/pelvis interaction. This paper describes a study performed to gain some insights into the problem. Two adult male volunteers served as test sub- jects. X-ray radiography was utilized to study their lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur configura- tions while in the seated posture. Whereas X-ray radiography appeared to be the technique offering the most complete documentation of the lower torso skeletal geometry, there were some problems as- sociated with adapting clinical diagnostic procedures to this study. First, with the subject positioned in a soft seat, it was not possible to juxtapose the film cassette and the lower torso properly because of seat cushion interference. Second, it was not pos- sible to X-ray the volunteer while seated in a com- plete vehicle. It was necessary to obtain a repre- sentative seat, mount if properly, and attempt to position the volunteer as though he were in a complete vehicle. The X-ray cassette/volunteer juxtaposition problem was solved by making a thin plaster cast of the volunteer/seat interface and constructing a narrow, wooden seat of proper contour to support the volunteer during the X-ray series. The narrow seat enabled the cassette to be located adjacent to the pelvis. Further descriptions and procedural details follow. VOLUNTEER SELECTION The test subjects consisted of two adult male volunteers. Volunteer LMP was near 50 years of age, and Volunteer CJM was near 60 years of age. Some anthropometric dimensions of the volunteers are summarized in Table I. Figure 1 defines the measurements. Volunteer LMP's stature and body mass approximate those of the USA 50th percentile adult male. Volunteer CJM is larger. VEHICLE SEAT DESCRIPTION The typical vehicle seat selected for this pro- gram was a 1971 Oldsmobile Delta bench seat*. Measurements were taken on a complete vehicle to enable proper orientation of the remotely tnounted seat. In addition, a foot support block was utilized to simulate the vehicle floorpan, thereby enabling proper (vehicle-like) support for the feet. The seat was vinyl-trimmed. * Although this paper bears a 1976 date, the study was performed in late 1972. According- ly, at that time, the 1971 seat design was not outdated. Further, current seats do not appear to differ significantly from the 1971 design. ABSTRACT An X-ray radiographic study of two volunteers in a vehicle seated configuration was performed to gain insights into the lower torso skeletal geometry associated with this posture. A pseudo three- dimensional analysis of each radiogram was utilized to obtain quantitative results. The analyses pro- vided indications of the pelvis and femur relative and absolute orientations. Further, the geometry of the lumbar spine and its location relative to the pelvis were defined. The relevance of the data from the standpoint of anthropomorphic dummy design is discussed, and recommendations are offered for further studies of vehicle seat/vehicle occupant interfacing biomechanics. Anthropometric data on each volunteer are included. 2610</page><page sequence="2">Table I-Voltmteer Anthropometry VOLUNTEER LMP * CJM ** MEASUREMENT cm In cm in Erect Standing Height 173.2 68.2 180.2 70.9 Erect Seated Height 89.

W. NYQUIST AND L. M. PATRICK The above description of the seat documents its design sufficiently to enable the procurement of design data from Fisher Body; however, there are significant variations in the characteristics of individual seats of the same design due to manufac- turing tolerances. Accordingly, the specific seat utilized in this study was further evaluated following the procedure specified in SAE Standard J826a (1)** wherein a three-dimensional H-point machine (Fig. 2) is utilized to define an H-point*** location and seatback angle*** for the particular test seat. Whereas the seating drawings indicate a 0.445 rad (25. 5 deg) seatback angle, the actual angle for the seat of this study was 0. 358 rad (20. 5 deg). Like- wise, there was an H-point location discrepancy. The actual H-point location for this seat was 1. 63 cm (0. 64 in) above and 0. 20 cm (0. 08 in) aft of the design location. In spite of the above discrepancies, the seat of this study was not judged to be atypical. Sub- jectively, it looked normal and felt normal. SOFT -SEAT CONTOUR OF THE VOLUNTEER Documentation of the contour of the interface of each volunteer with the soft seat was accom- plished as illustrated in Fig. 3. A thin sheet (approximately 5 mm (0. 2 in) thick) of plaster bandage of sufficient size to cover the interface was prepared and sandwiched between plastic sheeting. This preparation was positioned on the seat, after which the volunteer sat down and re- mained motionless during the curing cycle of the plaster. Careful removal of the volunteer 10 to 15 minutes later, followed by careful removal of the preparation from the seat, resulted in a thin casting documenting the interface contour (Fig. 4). The interface castings were used to prepare custom wooden X-ray seats (described in the next section of the report). Defining a criterion for positioning the volun- teer on the soft seat posed somewhat of a problem. ** Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. *** The H-point axis is a straight line connecting the left and right hip centers of rotation. From the left or right side it appears as a point - the H-point. The H-point is defined on the three- dimensional H-point machine. Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards refer to the location of the H-Point, relative to the seat, as the "seating reference point." ****The seatback angle is, by definition, an angle measured on the H-point machine. This angle represents the angle, relative to the vertical, of a tangent line to the "small of the back" (loins). Arbitrarily specifying and following some seating procedure would perhaps lead to a repeatable result, but it would not necessarily lead to a realis- tic result. On the other hand, it is also plausible that a given volunteer could assume many different postures in the same seat, since posture undoubt- edly depends to some degree on the volunteer1 s kinematics during the seating process. For this X-ray study of only two volunteers, without test replications, it was not feasible to define and con- trol the many pertinent seating parameters; therefore, the subjects were simply instructed to sit down in the driver location and "pretend that they were driving. " A marker on the wall in front of the subject, at eye height, was provided to represent a typical object upon which a driverTs eyes might fixate. The resulting postures are those shown in Fig. 3. (The arm was raised only momentarily to provide a better view of the torso. ) It is obvious that the two volunteer assumed similar, but not the same, postures. The most significant difference appears to be that C JM had his legs drawn up closer to the torso than did LMP. X-RAY SEAT PREPARATION The volunteer/soft seat interface castings were sectioned as illustrated in Fig. 5 to obtain profile information for fabrication of wooden X-ray seats. The locations of the left and right thighs and the spine were clear from indentations left in the cast- ings and served to define lines along which saw cuts were made. Poster board inserts through the saw cuts defined the midsagittal plane and left and right sagittal planes through the thighs. The poster board/contour casting intersection lines were traced onto the poster board for further analyses. To facilitate straight-forward fabrication of the wooden seats, it was desirable to approximate the Fig. 2 - H-point machine installed on soft seat</page><page sequence="4">LUMBAR AND PELVIC ORIENTATIONS OF THE VEHICLE SEATED VOLUNTEER 26 1 3 Fig. 3 - Determination of volunteer/sof t seat interface contour (Arms raised only momentarily to provide a better view of the torso) Fig. 4 - Volunteer/soft seat interface contour casting volunteer/soft seat interface by defining one repre- sentative profile line to approximate all sagittal section profile lines of the volunteer. That is, the contour of the wooden seat was to be of a two- dimensional nature, completely described by any one sagittal plane profile. Accordingly, the left and right thigh profiles were averaged and were used in conjunction with the spine profile to describe a single sagittal plane profile. The transition of profile definition from the thighs to profile defini- tion from the spine was made in the region of the superior aspect of the buttocks. The profiles established using the procedure described above were reproduced in wood, 30. 5 cm (12 in) thick (left to right) as shown in Fig. 6. The Fig. 5 - Sagittal and midsagittal planes through interface contour casting seats were designed with a seatback angle* of 0.45 rad (26 deg), and the contours were adjusted vertic- ally so that the lowest point (at the buttocks) was 10. 2 cm (4. 0 in) above the elevation of the surface supporting the feet. This vertical positioning was comparable to that of the three-dimensional H-point machine installation in the soft seat. The seats were placed on a 1. 04 m (41 in) high table for compatibility with the X-ray machine. * As noted earlier, in the discussion of the three- dimensional H-point machine, the seatback angle is the angle, relative to the vertical, of a tangent line to the "small of the back. M This tangent line was easily defined on the seat profiles. Seatback angles near 0.45 rad (26 deg) are widely used.</page><page sequence="5">2614 G. W. NYQUIST AND L. M. PATRICK Fig. 6 - Wooden X-ray seats X-RAY PROCEDURE The volunteers were X-rayed at the GM Tech- nical Center Main Medical facility. The wooden seat and custom support table were positioned in the X-ray facility such that the film cassette was parallel to the midsagittal plane of the seated volunteer and was adjacent to his right side. The X-ray Mpoint source" was nominally on a line from the center of the cassette, perpendicular to the film plane. For Volunteer LMP the X-ray source-to- cassette distance was 1.02 m (40 in), and the mid- sagittal plane-to-cassette distance was 27 cm (10. 5 in). For Volunteer C JM these distances were 1.22 m (48 in) and 28 cm (11 in), respectively. The seated volunteers are shown in Fig. 7. Acceptable skeletal definition in radiograms of the pelvic region produced from lateral exposures is difficult to achieve because of the large soft tissue thickness included in the paths of the rays. Four exposures were necessary to obtain a marginally satisfactory radiogram for the first subject, Volun- teer LMP. Marginal success for Volunteer C JM was achieved on the first exposure. Although these radiograms may not have been optimum, it appeared that the desired information could be obtained. Accordingly, in the interest of mitigating the volun- teers radiation exposure, no additional optimiza- tion was pursued. RESULTS X-ray radiogram tracings for the two volun- teers are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. The marginal contrast and clarity of the films precluded their reproduction as figures herein; however, with appropriate illumination, it was possible to accu- rately define the pertinent detail shown in these figures. Although the individual femurs could not be discerned clearly in the radiograms, an approxi- mation of the longitudinal axis direction was made based on the image(s) of the anterior and/or posterior surface(s) of the proximal portion of the shaft. The radiogram tracings of Figs. 8 and 9 also include indications of the vertical direction and the location of the center of the film. The tracings show double images for the anterior, superior iliac spine and the acetabulum. These represent left and right images, both of which appear on the radiogram because of the parallax present in the X-ray procedure. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS In order to define the position and orientation of the lower torso, it is necessary to establish a reference system on the pelvis. This topic has been treated in a recent study, "Static Bending Response of the Human Lower Torso" (1), where a pelvic reference system was established on volunteers. A pelvic triangle was defined as illus- trated in Fig. 10. By definition, the triangle lies in the midsagittal plane. The three apexes of the triangle, labeled H, I, and P in Fig. 10, are de- fined as follows: Point H is the bisector of the line joining the left and right hip joint centers of rota- tion; point I is the bisector of the line joining the left and right anterior, superior iliac spines; and point P is the point of tangency, at the pubic crest, of a midsagittal plane line containing point I. In the static bending response study referenced above, the pelvic triangle apexes were located by palpation. In contrast, for the program described in this report, X-ray radiography was utilized.

One1 s first thought may be that, on the radiogram, points H and I of the pelvic tri- angle lie midway between the associated left and right points. Actually, however, although this can be a reasonable first-order approximation, it is not the exact solution to the problem. An analysis of the above problem, enabling an exact solution, is presented in Appendix B. In this analysis a factor K is defined to locate, along the straight line connecting the left and right images on the radiogram, a point representing the image of a (midsagittal) point midway between the actual left and right points on the subject. The analysis shows that the value of K depends on dimensions dļ and used in computing the midsagittal plane scale factor and, in addition, one more dimension - the distance W between the left and right points. The dimension W was evaluated by means of palpation for the anterior, superior iliac spines (Wj). It was 26. 7 cm (10. 5 in) for each volunteer. Dimension W for the hip centers of rotation (WH) cannot be evaluated by palpation because the hip sockets are inaccessible. Accordingly, the value was extrapolated from the anterior, superior iliac spine W-dimension. Measurements on an excised human cadaver pelvis* indicated that: * WSU Cadaver 2955, 184 cm (72. 5 in) stature, 75. 6 kg (166. 5 lb). WH = I Wj . (5) Thus, the extrapolated value for the hip centers of rotation of the volunteers is: WH = f (26* 7 cm) = 20. 3 cm (7. 9 in). (6) The above values of Wjj and Wj, used in con- junction with the X-ray setup dimensions dļ and 02 noted earlier, were substituted into equation (B-10) to obtain the K values of Table E. This information was used in conjunction with geometric data from Figs. 8 and 9 to plot the pelvic triangles. (The hip centers of rotation were assumed to be located at the centers of the circular acetabulum images. ) The plots are presented in Figs. 11 and 12. The vertebrae tracings of Figs. 8 and 9 were analyzed to provide the spine data plotted in Figs. 11 and 12. The centers of the vertebral interspaces and the centers of the vertebral bodies were estab- lished using the constructions illustrated in Fig. 13. In this figure points A through F are subjective approximations of the " corners" of the vertebral bodies as they appear in a lateral (left-right) radio- gram. Point P is midway between points A and B, and point Q is midway between points C and D. The vertebral interspace center is midway between points P and Q. Likewise, the vertebral body center is taken as the intersection point of straight line segments through points C and F and points D and E.

APPENDIX A - X-RAY RADIOGRAM SCALE FACTOR Images of objects on X-ray radiograms are always larger than full scale due to the geometry of the setup (object positioned between X-ray source and film). Therefore, in quantitative analyses of radiograms, to obtain anthropometric data, it is important that a scale factor be defined and evalu- ated for each radiogram to enable scaling of mea- surements to full size. The geometry of a typical X-ray setup is illustrated in Fig. A-l. An X-ray point source is located a distance dļ from the film plane of an X-ray cassette. Consider a radiopaque object of length £ located a distance from the film plane. Also, the object is located a radial distance R from the axis constructed through the X-ray source, perpendicular to the film plane. The shadow of this object on the film plane is the image, of length £f, recorded on the radiogram. It is obvious from Fig. A-l that V &gt; Zfor d2 &lt; d1. It is convenient to define a scale factor S as: S = i • (A~1} The scale factor is therefore a number always greater than unity for clinical type radiological studies.</page><page sequence="10">LUMBAR AND PELVIC ORIENTATIONS OF THE VEHICLE SEATED VOLUNTEER 26 1 9 Film Plane '™a9e Object / g' j~~ X-ray Point | | ♦ P Source - - j " q | | / i Ł1" " i I _2_ - d2 - d! Fig. A-l - X-ray setup geometry A simple exercise in geometry enables the scale factor to be defined in terms of the dimensions of the setup. An analysis of similar triangles in Fig. A-l enables one to write: â_ = R-i/2 d -d ' (A 2) 2 12 Likewise, P + R - £/2 _ R + £/2 d _ d - d * ' 1 1 2 Solving equations (A-2) and (A-3) for Q and P and noting that ť = P - Q enables one to obtain the following expression for the image length: di = ¿ T- l • (A-4) 1 2 Thus, using equations (A-l) and (A-4) gives the scale factor: s - It is interesting to note that the scale factor is independent of the radial distance R. The validity of this analysis was checked ex- perimentally by X-raying a 25 mm (one in) square grid pattern constructed of lead spheres embedded in a flat sheet of plastic (Figure A-2). Dimension dļ was set to 1. 02 m (40 in), and values of 20 and 30 cm (8 and 12 in) were utilized for dimension c^. The difference between the theoretically and experi- mentally derived radiogram scale factors was negligible (less than 0. 5 percent error). APPENDIX B - RADIOGRAM ANALYSIS FOR THE PELVIC TRIANGLE A discussion regarding the scale factor of an X-ray radiogram was presented in Appendix A. It is clear that equation (A-5) may be used when Fig. A-l is adequate to describe the geometry of the setup. For a three-dimensional object such as the pelvis, it is apparent that the scale factor analysis of Fig. A-l is not sufficient because one plane, at a single distance from the film plane, is inadequate to describe the location of all points on the object. For pelvic triangle determination, however, where it is reasonable to assume skeletal symmetry with respect to the midsagittal plane, one can define virtual (not actually present) radio- paque points, midway between the anterior, super- ior iliac spines and midway between the hip joint centers of rotation. Further, criteria can be defined for determining where the images, of these virtual points, would be located on the radiogram. These images, along with the image of the pubic crest, are images of the three apexes of the pelvic triangle (Fig. 10). Since the pelvic triangle lies in the midsagittal plane, and the midsagittal plane has one unique d2 dimension (Fig. A-l), the geom- etry of Fig. A-l, and therefore the scale factor definition of equation (A-5), may be used to scale the radiogram pelvic triangle image back to full size. The criteria for determining where the images of the virtual points are located on the radiogram is developed in the following presenta- tion. Figure B-l illustrates the geometry for a lat- eral pelvic X-ray setup. Pelvic points Q ¿ and Qr are symmetrically located relative to the mid- sagittal plane and may be thought of as either the left and right anterior, superior iliac spine points, or the centers of rotation of the left and right hip joints. They are located a radial distance R from the film plane normal through the X-ray source. The X-ray source is located a distance d^ from the X-ray film plane, and the midsagittal plane- to-film plane distance is c^. Point is the radiogram image of point , and Qłr is the image of Qr. Likewise, point Q is the virtual radiopaque point midway between Q ¿ and Qr , and its virtual image is Q' It is obvious from the figure that, although Q is midway between and Qr, the virtual image QT is not midway between images QT¿ and QTr; that is, the factor KT is not equal to unity. Concisely stated, the problem is to derive an expression to evaluate the factor Kł in terms of the parameters of the X-ray geometry. This derivation follows.

It depends only on the object and image distances d^ and required for scale factor determination [ equation (A -5)] and the width W separating the left and right anatomical points. The radiogram produced under the conditions of Fig. B-l contains image points QT¿ and QTr. Accordingly, one can physically measure the distance QTr- Also, it is apparent from Fig. B-l that h'(l+Kf) = Q'Ä Q'r . Therefore, hT = - - Q' ^ Q! ^ ' , (B-ll) v ' - 1+KT - ^ Q' I ^ Q! r ' , (B-ll) v ' where KT is evaluated using equation (B-10). Equa- tion (B-ll) enables one to locate the desired virtual image point QT of Fig. B-l. The distance hł is al- ways measured from the image point most distant from the film plane normal through the X-ray source toward the image point nearest this normal. That is, in Fig. B-l, hT is measured from QT£ toward QTr to define point QT. Note that the point where this normal intersects the film plane need not be known. It is only necessary that one establish which vector, QVQV or , points toward the normal. The validity of this analysis was checked ex- perimentally by X-raying a plastic mock pelvis constructed with small lead spheres representing the pubic crest and the left and right hip sockets and anterior, superior iliac spines (Figure B-2). Dimension d^ was set to 1.02m (40 in), and values of 20 and 30 cm (8 and 12 in) were utilized for dimension d% (measured to the midsagittal plane). The pelvic triangle shapes derived from analyses of the radiograms were compared with the actual triangle geometry of the mock pelvis. Errors in the angles were within the limit of resolution of the measurements [less than 0. 009 rad (0. 5 deg)] . The maximum error in the triangle leg lengths was two percent.</page></plain_text>
