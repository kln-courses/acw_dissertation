They confronted and provoked them with seemingly obvious images drawn from daily life and with enigmatic teachings, with inspiring shouts and paradoxical meditation tasks, kdan. In Zen, the immediate passing on of the "Dharma Flame", the personal religious experience, from teacher to disciple is pivotal. One flame of awakening is lighting the flame of the next lamp. This experience pervades body and spirit in its totality as well as individuality through the tranquillity and calm of meditative absorption. The masters wrote their messages on paintings in verse and prose, and they tried to render their teachings comprehensible by using the language of imagery. In the "ink traces", bokuseki, of their brush and in the portraits, chinzd, the characters and substance of the masters are revealed most poignantly, and both served the Zen disciples to absorb word and spirit of their religious paragons, enabling them to trans- mit their teachings faithfully. By concentrating on major figures from Zen history and leg- end and on some outstanding prelates of the medieval Zen clergy, it is intended to bring these masters into the clearest possible focus, to "re-animate" them, so to speak, by means of their extant works and the interpretative representations of their physical appearances. The immediate contact between master and disciple, as well as the rela- tionship among leading monks, especially in Kybto, their literary and artistic interests, their tangible surroundings in the monasteries, and their immersion in the traditional cur- rent of their school were to be intimated just as well as the historical circumstances and the exchange between Chinese and Japanese Zen. At the same time this study intends to reveal the intrinsic worth of Zen architecture, sculptures, writings, and paintings themselves. The introductory essays attempt to place Zen art in a new and proper per- spective and to note its seminal influences. When teaching, the masters of meditation often used the "Oxherding" parable which - usually in ten steps - is supposed to illustrate and help to ease the path toward enlight- enment. For the preparation of the exhibition ZEN - Meister der Meditation in Bildern und Schriften which was held at the Rietberg Museum Zurich in the spring of 1993 and the subsequent publication of an English edition of the catalogue we may have needed a few more steps, but it seemed to me that the stages toward the realization of our pro- ject were often quite similar. During the first phase, "Looking for the Ox", jingyu, we were able to establish contact with the Kybto National Museum and the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Bunkachb, in Tokyo several years ago, and to present our wishes. We are greatly indebted to the former Director of the Kybto National Museum, Professor Shumpei U'eyama, and to his successor, Professor Norio Fujisawa, but especially to the former Chief Curator Hiroshi Kanazawa, for their generous professional support; without them, we would never have discovered the "Traces of the Ox", kenseki. On the third level of our path, while "Seeing the Ox", ken gyG, we could count on the help of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, above all Messr. Hiroyasu Uchida, Nobuyoshi Yamamoto, Akiyoshi Watanabe, and Hiromitsu Washizuka. As we set out to "Catch the Ox", tokugyG, and get the approval of the owners of the selected works for an exhibition at the Rietberg Museum and for publication, we were fortunate enough to have the help of our col- 7</page><page sequence="7">leagues and friends in the respective Japanese museums, of the representatives of the Zen monasteries, especially in Kybto, and of the private collectors. I would like to note, with sincere thanks, that during my visits to Japan, everybody showed unfailing sym- pathy, welcomed the idea and the concept of a Zen exhibition and a book in this form with the greatest encouragement, and agreed, in some cases rebonding old friendships, to put their valuable treasures at the disposal of the project in Zorich. During the fifth stage, "Herding the Ox", bokugyu, I could count on the circumspect, friendly collaboration of all my colleagues at the Rietberg Museum. The director, Dr. Eberhard Fischer, was always available for consultation and had the most sensitive understanding of the material that was, at first, foreign to him; with the greatest empathy he has welcomed my not always immediately intelligible ideas and realized them in a most efficient and suitable way. Andreas Leisinger earned great merit in the phase of "Returning Home on the Back of the Ox", kigyu kika. He undertook the laborious task of preparing an English translation of my original German text. With enthusiasm and unsparing in his efforts, he dared this difficult ox ride, succeeding not only unscathed, but with great bravura. My old friend Dr. Thomas Lawton, Senior Research Scholar of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Washington, D.C., as well as Professors Sylvan Barnet and William Burto kindly consented to read the English type- script and suggested many improvements. The seventh phase, "The Ox Forgotten, the Man Remains", bdgyu sonjin, was for me the work on this book. With their catalogue entries and scholarly expertise, Eikei Akao, Hiroshi Kanazawa, Shigeki Kawakami, Frangois Louis, and Hideo Yamamoto greatly contributed to making the works of Zen art somewhat easier of access to the reader. Deep appreciation is extended to them for their generous support. Many monasteries, museums, libraries, and individuals kindly supplied photographs and permission to pub- lish their objects. I would like to thank Kybtarb Nishikawa, Director-General of the Tokyo National Research Institute of Cultural Properties, as representative of all those col- leagues and institutions. Fred Bauer designed the original German catalogue and Elizabeth Hefti the English edition for Artibus Asiae with artistic empathy for the mater- ial, with patience and understanding for my special requests, and with unstinting initia- tive. My thanks also go to Katharina Epprecht, Andrea Kuprecht, Lin Ching-Wen, and Daniel Schneiter, who helped with the arduous task of proofreading and compiling the glossary and index. For all shortcomings and mistakes which may have escaped the at- tention of my colleagues and my "mouse", the correction and search key of my nibbled Apple I Isi, responsibility rests with me alone. The eighth phase, "Both Man and Ox For- gotten", ningyG gubd, symbolized by an empty circle is only possible when the financing of such a project is secured. The Toshiba International Foundation in Tokyo had a de- cisive part in that aspect and thus sincere gratitude for the opportunity to prepare an English edition is owed to Messr. Ariyoshi Kondoh and Michihisa Kitashirakawa, Senior Managing Directors. In order to "Return to the Fundamental, Back to the Source", henpon gengen, repre- sented allegorically by the "Three Pure Ones", bamboo, plum, and rock, I thank Claudia, Jan, and Connie who set me free with great leniency and over long spans of time. I con- sider the fact that the exhibition and finally an English edition of the book were realized in this form as a personal present from many, and would like to thank all who have par- ticipated in Kyoto, Tokyo, and elsewhere in Japan as well as in the United States and in Zurich. In the end, there remains the wish that the reader may "Enter the City with Hands Hanging Down", nitten suishu, as Hotei once did, cheerful, unassuming, and above worldly concerns; that he will return into the world as being enlightened to at least some degree; and that he may have found, in his hectic daily rhythm, some time for contem- plation and reflection on his own Self after the dialogue with these centuries-old mas- terpieces of Zen art.

Tokyo National Museum (No. 12). One of the most influential masters of meditation to this day and a significant contribu- tor to the introduction of Zen in Japan, the forceful thinker Dogen Kigen (1200-1253), summarized the quintessential substance of Zen as follows in his first chapter on "The Actualization of Enlightenment", Genjbkcan, of his monumental work Shobogenzo, "Eye- Treasury of the True Dharma": To learn the Buddhist way is to learn about oneself. To learn about oneself is to forget oneself. To forget oneself is to perceive oneself as all things. To realize this is to cast off the body and mind of self and others. When you have reached this stage you will be detached even from enlightenment but will practice it continually without thinking about it. When people begin to seek the Dharma [outside themselves] they are immediately far removed from its true location. When the Dharma has been received through the right transmission, one's real self immediately appears. 1 People in Japan traditionally have tended to understand and experience "all things" of this world, animate and inanimate, from within, to let themselves be seized and taken by them, much more so than in the West, where we try to comprehend and intellectually analyze them from the outside. This applies especially to people who have entrusted themselves to Zen Buddhism and its thinking. Works of art partaking of the Zen spirit thus require from the viewer, such as hardly any other art form, silent, patient self-absorption, concentrated, pure harkening to the soundless message which in the end retracts every- thing and emanates the absolute void (Chin. wu, Jap. mu) beyond all form and colour, whether it is an abstract "dry landscape garden" made of rocks and sand, a sponta- neously brushed, bold scroll of Chinese characters, a sparse ink painting, or a rough tea bowl. If we know how to receive and recreate this Zen paradox of the silent message - it can hardly be understood or rationally grasped - we may hope to be touched by the specific atmosphere of these works of Zen art, and moved by their depth and loftiness often con- cealed in their everyday appearance. The problem is to find the wave-length required for receiving. The German philosopher Eugen Herrigel (1884-1955), who, as a profound authority on mysticism was able to acquire an unusually deep understanding of Zen, describes from his own experience the force emanating from such works of art: These quite simple pictures, showing so infinitely little, are so full of Zen that the beholder feels overwhelmed by them. Anyone who has seen, at a long-drawn-out tea ceremony, how the whole atmosphere is determined after a pause by the change of the hanging scroll and a flower, how the guests, sunk in contemplation before the painting, experi- ence an unveiling of mysteries which none of them can put into words, and depart from the tea room feeling unutterably enriched, will know what power emanates from such images.2 But before we face the challenge of this art, we must ask: what is Zen? Is it the abun- dance of emptiness; is it the nothing of Being; is it the meditative immersion into one's 11</page><page sequence="11">Self, or the mystic revelation of the absolute truth? The answer is difficult, since it will by definition adulterate the essence of Zen and tarnish its enlightening clarity. Once upon a time, three wandering Buddhist monks of the orthodox school met a Zen disciple who was just coming back from an encounter with the Master Linji Yixuan (Jap. Rinzai Gigen, died 867), famous for his especially drastic teaching methods. Since the place of their meeting was the bridge, one of the monks asked, in allusion to the location: "How deep is the river of Zen?" Spontaneously, the Linji disciple answered: "That is something you'll have to find out for yourself!", and the two companions of the curious monk could barely keep their Zen brethren from throwing their friend in the river. The anecdote indicates that, although the question can ultimately be answered only by our own experience, we feel compelled to find intellectual explanations. From an etymological point of view, Zen is the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese character Chan, which in turn entered the Chinese vocabulary as an abbrevi- ated form of the Sanskrit word Dhyana. In the following, we shall not make any rigid sep- aration between Zen and Chan, but every now and then employ the customary Japanese pronunciation even when dealing with Chinese contexts. Usually, Zen is translated as "meditation" or "contemplation", but perhaps more precisely as "immersion". Originally, the word signified the Buddhist practice of opening oneself to the essential core of things, allowing space for the immediacy of perception, letting oneself go in the dynamic of ele- mentary existential contexts growing out of tranquillity and calmness. In China, there had been rudiments of this religious practice since the second century. From the sixth cen- tury on, Chan gained popularity in China, probably in reaction to the exaggerated dog- matism, the metaphysical abstraction, and the speculative system of the orthodox Buddhist church. In Japan, Zen flourished from the end of the twelfth century. Although in Japan, Zen Buddhism has remained alive as a religious movement down to the present and has exerted its influence especially in America and Europe, it has often become a misunderstood and misused fad. Nevertheless, in rapidly changing Japan as well as in the hectic western world, this meditative form of Buddhism has reached realms far beyond its original sphere and has been - despite all distortions - a fertile inspiration for new and promising initiatives. To be sure, enthusiasm should not cloud the fact that Zen is neither an occult Asian doctrine offering redemption nor an irrational, mystically meditative religion. Nor is Zen suitable to free oneself of the restraints of rigid conven- tional social structures or to be used as effective instrument of psycho-analysis. What differentiates Zen most characteristically from all other teachings, religious, philo- sophical, or mystical, is that while it never goes out of our daily life, yet with all its prac- ticalness and concreteness Zen has something in it which makes it stand aloof from the scene of worldly sordidness and restlessness. 3 Zen is one of the numerous movements and schools - but not sects - of Mahayana Buddhism. Its followers attempt to reach "awakening" or "enlightenment", wu (Jap. mu) or, to use the better known Japanese term, satori, by means of introspection and intu- itive awareness of religious truth beyond orthodox doctrine, dogmatic writings, and tra- ditional rituals. Satori can either mature slowly or happen suddenly from the deepest recesses of one's own self, often accelerated or triggered by seemingly insignificant events. Theoretical methodology and analytical thought processes, all of which have to use language or writing, cannot lead to enlightenment. Satori is attained in daily, even every-day consciousness; it grasps and permeates body and spirit in their totality as one. The intellect, which may bring forth logic and scientific systems of clarification, is com- pletely eliminated from this process, since it directs attention to the exterior form, the sur- face, to the unimportant aspect, and fails to provide the view into the inner truth of this world, a view that can be obtained only by personal experience. Psychologically speaking, satori is thus the realm beyond the limits of the Self. Philo- sophically seen, it/is insight into the synthesis of affirmation and negation, speaking meta- physically, it is intuitive apprehension that Being is Becoming, and Becoming is Being.4 The basic tenets of Zen may be best expressed in a striking stanza of four lines, con- sisting of four characters each. These lines, said to have been composed by the Indian 12 3 Daisetz T. Suzuki in his introduction to Eugen Her- rigel: Zen in the Art of Archery.

Boku'an Zenky5) in his "Collection of Items from the Garden of the Patriarchs", Zuting shiyuan (Jap. Soteiji'en), but each individual line can be traced back to texts of the Tang Dynasty. Except for the first line the verse also appears in chapter 2 of the "Recorded Sayings of the Chan Master Wuzu Fayan [1025?-1104]", Wuzu Fayan Chanshi yulu (Jap. Goso Ho'en Zenji goroku), allegedly published in 1098; Taishd shinshJ dai- zdkyd, No. 1995, Vol. 47, p. 659b. Cf. also the translation by Dumoulin: op. cit. (1985), p. 83, and T.

Bodai Daruma; died before 534)5 as sum- mary of his new doctrine, are thought by scholars to have been written by the Tang mas- ter Nanquan Puyuan (Jap. Nansen Fugan, 748-834): A special transmission outside the teachings jiaowai biechuan (Jap. kyoge betsuden); No dependence upon words and letters buli wenzi (Jap. furyu monji); Directly pointing at the mind of man zhizhi renxin (Jap. jikishi ninshin); Seeing into his own nature, man attains Buddhahood jianxing chengfo (Jap. kenshb jbbutsu).6 During the Song Dynasty this maxim became the subject to conflicting interpretations, because some Chan masters understood the quatrain in a more figurative sense and others took it literally. The first two lines are aimed at scholastic pedantry and systematic teaching, at doctrinal orthodoxy and blind confidence in religious texts. They demand the radical rejection of religious scriptures - an enormous revolution! - and instead postulate the personal transmitting of the essential Buddhist truth by the master to the disciple, the "transmission from mind to mind", yixin chuanxin (Jap. ishin denshin). This formula, which has become a pivotal concept of Zen, is taken from Fabaotan ling (Jap. Hdbbdangyb), the "Platform Sutra", traditionally thought to have been written by the sixth Chan patri- arch Huineng (Jap. E'no, 638-713). The enlightened spirit of the master acts as a cata- lyst igniting a similar experience in the spirit of the disciple without adding anything of its own, an experience which has to be created by the disciple out of his inner Self, and which cannot be given to him by the master. This is why the masters of meditation keep emphasizing that ultimately, Zen can neither be taught nor transmitted; concepts such as "doctrine, transmission, mediation" in connection with Zen must therefore be under- stood as expedient substitute terms to name a process that, in final analysis, cannot be apprehended conceptually or intellectually. In the invisible, wordless "transmission" of the most profound religious experiences, Zen reduces its communication to the extreme of the "thundering silence", to use an expression of the "Vimalakirti Sutra" (Jap. Yuimagyb) often cited by Zen masters. In itself, the word is less than the thought; the thought is less than the experience. The word is the filtrate, a residue stripped of its best components. 7 The personal encounter between master and disciple is emphasized here. The individual experience of the absolute transcendence is the objective of Zen. This can be reached by the follower only directly, by attaining knowledge of his own self. This process is fur- thered, sometimes even provoked, by an experienced spiritual teacher's "immediate pointing at the mind of man". In the end, the elucidation of one's innermost self permits experiencing the identity of one's own self with the absolute, the perception of one's own primeval completeness, the Buddha Nature. The famous Chinese Chan master Huangbo Xiyun (Jap. Obaku Ki'un, died around 850) is supposed to have said: Since the spirit is Buddha, the ideal path to perfection is the unfolding of this Buddha spirit. Just avoid abstract thinking which leads to rise and fall, to the misery in the world of the senses, and to many other things. Then you won't need paths to enlightenment anymore. Therefore it is written: Buddha's teachings have but one aim: To transcend the realm of thought. Once the game of thoughts is silenced, What good are Buddha's teachings then?8 One means toward such liberating experience, toward unconscious emptying of oneself, is the kind of "meditation" which gave the school its name. Called zazen in Japanese, "sitting in immersion" with folded legs and natural breathing, induces relaxed, unpremed- itated tranquillity in the nevertheless clearly awake body and spirit. Disciples slackening in their concentration are incited and stimulated by vigorous blows on shoulders and the 13</page><page sequence="13">back with a flattened admonition staff, kybsaku or keisaku, held by the masters in numer- ous portraits. Between the periods of seated meditation "regulated walking", kinhin, is practised. This contributes to the development of the ability to "carry over" the practise of Zen into every-day life and routine actions. Shouting the untranslatable shock-scream "He!" (Jap. "Katsu!") at the disciple, a practise of the Linji or Rinzai school, is meant to encourage and spur on, much like the blows with the kybsaku; these shouts can help the disciple to experience satori . Other important agents of Zen education are the kban. These paradoxical spiritual "test cases", gong'an in Chinese, elude all attempts at solution by logical thinking. The term literally means "magistrate's table" and refers in its original context to a case in court. In the course of time, voluminous collections of kban were compiled in Chinese Chan circles. Among the best-known ones are the Biyanlu (Jap. Hekiganroku), the "Blue Cliff Record",9 compiled by Yuanwu Keqin (Jap. Engo Kokugon, 1063-1135) and first printed in 1125; and the Wumenguan (Jap. Mumonkan), the "Gateless Barrier",10 compiled by Wumen Huikai (Jap. Mumon Ekai, 1183-1260) and published in 1228. The contents of kban often contain anecdotal, legendary, and biographical events, dialogues, and say- ings of the great patriarchs. They were meant as instruments for the disciple's own reli- gious exercises and could finally lead him to his goal, i.e., enlightenment. For example, one monk asked his master: "Whenever one has a question, one's mind feels confused. How is that so?" The master's answer: "Kill, kill!" The seemingly brutal command of the master no doubt aims at killing desires, at eliminating thoughts, at emptying one's mind, and thus at the preparation for the experience of enlightenment. Another monk asked: "What is the most profound significance of the Buddha Law?" The master's answer: "To fill all streams and valleys." Another question concerned silence; thus, a studious Zen dis- ciple asked: "How can silence be expressed?" The master answered: "I do not want to express it here." The disciple insisted: "Where do you want to express it?" The master: "Last night around midnight, I lost three pennies near my bed."1 Such provocative med- itation tasks were most susceptible to stimulate the phantasy of painters and to lead to a translation of Zen thought into the visual arts.

The art of Zen - Zen in the arts - Zen art: these seemingly senseless juxtapositions are not to be understood as capricious puns or an attempt to formulate a typical Zen "case", a kban, but they are to suggest the complexity and the dimensions of the phenomenon, the mutual inspiration, as well as the penetration - eliminating opposites and dualities - of various tendencies in religious, cultural, and intellectual history which have found expression in this art. Eugen Herrigel regards Zen painting as the consequence of satori the way in which it expresses itself pictorially. [..] For there is a distinct school of Zen painting: works in which the illuminated vision of existence is the theme of the picture.12 However, Zen writing and painting were not, as one might imagine, created inevitably and exclusively by Zen monks for Zen monasteries or for members of the Zen community. Especially in China, works of art in the Zen spirit were written and painted by scholars, poets, and statesmen, i.e., literati at times inspired by Chan masters who were among their friends. Sometimes, traditionally trained members of the "Imperial Academy of Art" might treat a Zen theme, commissioned by a monastery, a prelate, or maybe even by a secular ruler sympathetic to Buddhism, such as an Emperor or a Shbgun. Due to the sometimes close contacts with court officials, educated as a rule in Confucianism, Zen monks were able to widen their horizon far beyond the limits of their monastic environ- ment. In such cases, Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism encountered each other in a stimulating, creative cultural exchange. Mutual inspiration in philosophy, art, and litera- ture of the two creeds knows no bounds. This led to a situation where artists who were not members of the Buddhist clergy cre- ated typical Zen paintings and writings, while at the same time painter-monks adopted artistic concepts, themes, and styles of the literati and created typical literati paintings such as classical landscape views or elegant representations of orchids, bamboo, and rocks. Such works raise a number of questions: Are these works paintings and writings of Zen Buddhism? Are these works of art in the Zen spirit? Are these forms of Buddhist art at all, or are they manifestations - without any religious connotations - of artistically talented clergy men? Perhaps the following line of thought will provide answers to these questions. First, however, Daoism must be mentioned as another spiritual source of Zen and its art. Indian Buddhist thought, from which Zen borrowed the idea of the omnipresence of the Buddha Nature, was very close to the Chinese concept of the transcendent principle, the idea of the Dao residing in all things and manifesting itself everywhere in nature. By sim- ilar contemplative practices, Zen Buddhists and Daoists alike tried to attain insight into the elemental causal forces of the world, into the foundation of being. Both schools emphasized the original act of insight into the nature of being, mistrusted any intellectu- alization of their teachings, and valued the transmission of the "doctrine without words", an expression coined by Daoists and destined to become an integral part of Zen Buddhistic thought. 17</page><page sequence="16">Against the background of such a world view, representations of nature, especially land- scapes, almost inevitably became the appropriate medium of expression of this cosmo- sophical interpretation of life in the circles of Zen Buddhist painters. Thanks to their reli- gious enlightenment, they perceived the world around them in a special way. Inside them, a change had occurred which freed their eyes for the presence of redemptive reality in the world of empirical phenomena, the elimination of all their dualities which let their eyes see the unity in the multiplicity of the empirical world. An old Chan master said: Before a man studies Zen, to him mountains are mountains and waters are waters; after he gets an insight into the truth of Zen through the instruction of a good master, moun- tains to him are not mountains and waters are not waters; but after this when he really attains to the abode of rest, mountains are once more mountains and waters are waters. 13 In order to illuminate further the Zen artist's insight into things and reality, an insight that cancels all opposites, let us cite again Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki, who writes as follows: To become a bamboo and to forget that you are one with it while drawing it - this is the Zen of the bamboo, this is the moving with the "rhythmic movement of the spirit" which resides in the bamboo as well as in the artist himself. What is now required of him is to have a firm hold on the spirirt and yet not to be conscious of the fact. This is a very dif- ficult task achieved only after long spiritual training. The Eastern people have been taught since the earliest times to subject themselves to this kind of discipline if they want to achieve something in the world of art and religion. Zen, in fact, has given expression to it in the following phrase: "One in All and All in One" When this is thoroughly understood, there is creative genius. 14 This fundamental phrase does not reflect a pantheistic world view of Zen; rather, it shows again the strong influence of Daoism, according to which the dao, the "Way of Nature", is revealed everywhere in the existing reality, and all opposites are eliminated by mutual penetration, including those between fullness and emptiness, between variety and unity, between "One and All". The syncretic fusion of Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian thought and expression patterns found its most poignant definition in the theory of the "Three Creeds and One Source", sanjiao yizhi (Jap. sankyb itchi). It had a long and vigorous history in China. In Li Shiqian's biography recorded by Li Yanshou (active 7th century) in his "History of the Northern Dynasties", Beishi, it is said: A guest once asked Shiqian about the relative merits of the three doctrines. He replied: "Buddhism is the sun, Daoism is the moon, and Confucianism, the five planets." The guest could not find fault with this and so left off questioning him. 15 Under Imperial patronage, symposia and public debates were held, during which lead- ing representatives discussed the relation between the three doctrines advocated by them, citing their advantages and disadvantages. The famous Tang poet Bai Juyi (772-846) reported on such a debate which took place in the tenth month of the year 827 in compliance with a command by the court. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties the compatibility of the three doctrines was no longer seriously disputable and firmly established in religious as well as in intellectual circles.16 Painters of the ninth and tenth centuries, such as Sun Wei and Shi Ke, began to unite the protagonists of the three doc- trines, i.e., the historical Buddha 8akyamuni, Laozi, and Confucius, in a group composi- tion, and this triumvirate was enthusiastically received into the tolerant atmosphere of Zen, especially during the fifteenth century in Japan.17 A vivid echo of such Song images has been preserved on a stele of 1209 at Shaolinsi on Mt. Song in Henan Province, the monastery where the first Chan patriarch in China, the Indian Bodhidharma (died before 534), is said to have sat in meditation for nine years facing a wall and where the second patriarch Huike (487-593) cut off his arm to show his spiritual determination. The model for the engraving was done by a Chan painter-monk named Zuzhao from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province who also provided the inscription. Though biographical information about Zuzhao is wanting he must have been a talented and important master of painting 18 3 Daisetz T. Suzuki: Essays in Zen Buddhism (First Series).

The inscription of the sanjiao configuration was composed by the Tang Emperor Suzong (711-762, reigned 756-762) and is said to have been based on the stone edition of 977 in the Imperial Academy at Chang'an. The majestic central en face image of Sakyamuni slightly elevated on two lotus pedestals under his feet is propor- tionally taller than the standing figures of Laozi to his left and Confucius to his right. "The element of parody visible in the forms of these figures is underlined by their depiction in three distinct styles. Thus the Buddha's drapery is indicated by close-set parallel lines flanked by fluttering, curvilinear folds. By contrast, Lao-tzu's [Laozi's] robe has a certain 'primitive simplicity', for it is defined by relatively few, straightforward lines of even width. On the other hand, Confucius' apparel is given a literary air by numerous modulated strokes with hooked or 'nail-headed' ends that create a rather fussy effect. The rubbing thus presumably suggests something of the range of brush manners that would have been found in copybooks of the time, and that no doubt served as a reference for the painter's visual punning."'18 Moreover the peculiar facial and stylistic features of the Buddha as well as the flaming halo around his head seem to emphasize the foreignness of Sakyamuni. The notion of syncretic fusion of the three doctrines and one source is convincingly put forward in the Shaolin Monastery's stele. Contradictions among the three teachings were interpreted as different aspects of one and the same thing, and dismissed as such. "Zen Buddhists are sometimes Confucianists, sometimes Taoists, or sometimes even Shintoists"; thus the succinct and startling comment by Suzuki concerning this point.19 Already six centuries earlier the Chan master Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (Jap. Seisetsu Shocho, 1274-1339), who migrated from China to Japan in 1326, made a similar com- ment. He wrote on a - now probably lost - painting by Yintuoluo (active first half 14th century) showing the founders of the "Three Creeds": The Magistrate of Lu [Confucius] The Pillar of Zhou [Laozi], And who is the person in front of them? The princely son of Suddhodana [85kyamuni] The three are all masters. Choose among them a good one, And follow him! 1335, early spring. Respectfully written by the tramana of Kenninji. Qingzhuo Zhengcheng.20 The best-known extant example showing Sakyamuni, Laozi, and Confucius is a hanging scroll at Rybsoku'in of Kenninji in Kybto (No. 5, Fig. 3). Painted in rough, spontaneous ink technique, the scroll was rediscovered in 1916. It bears two inscriptions, one of which, signed "Old Kantb" (or Kanjbsb) attributes the painting to Josetsu, an attribution that has been widely accepted. The inscription deals chiefly with the chronology of the three sages and toward the end contains a brief comment on the origin of Josetsu's priest name: The name of this accomplished painter is Setsu, "Clumsy" He was given this name by Master Kosho, who took it from the line, "the greatest skill is like clumsiness. " He painted the Three Doctrines in one painting in order to demonstrate that they are in agreement. Although it may be a playful composition, it is not without benefit to the world.21 Josetsu seems to have been active at Shokokuji in Kyoto at the beginning of the fifteenth century. He is mentioned only once in a contemporary source in connection with the erection of a memorial stele between 1414 and 1418 at Rokuon'in in honour of the found- ing abbot of Shbkokuji, the celebrated Muso Soseki (1275-1351). His name Josetsu, lit- erally meaning "like clumsiness", was allegedly given to him by the learned Zen master and poet Zekkai Chushin (i.e., Kosho, 1336-1405) in allusion to a passage in the 45th chapter of the Daoist classic Daodefing, the "Book of the Way and Its Virtue": Treat the straightest as crooked, the cleverest as clumsy, the most eloquent as stammering.22 19</page><page sequence="18">The second inscription, written directly above the painting and dated to 1493, is proba- bly about a century later than the work. It is by the Zen monk ShojD Ryutb (1429-1498) who lived mostly at Nanzenji in Kybto: Buddha, Confucius, and Lao-tzu [Laozi] - these three are one and this one is three. From three are generated a myriad things. These three sages are like three boatmen. One virtue is shared by all. Their great ship contains Heaven and Earth and carries both sages and common men. From eighteen thousand leagues to the west, they turn the ship and move it eighteen thousand leagues to the east. Setting the direction three hundred and fifty years previously, they observed the wind, and three hundred and fifty years later they adjusted the sails on a different course. [The Daoists] Mao Ying and Ch'en Hsaan [Chen Xuan] summoned their young Confucian pupils and taught them. [The Buddha disciple] Kasyapa stood and conversed and was thus able to make manifest the Buddha's teach- ing. Teacher after teacher followed their lead. Master and disciple studied together. If one were to debate the relative merits of these three teachings: The stars like white plum blossoms, the moon like red apricots - Yet how can they compare with the brilliant sun that lightens the dark clouds? (Dated) The [eleventh month of the] second year of Meib [1493]. (Signed) The Buddhist monk of Japan, ShoshJ [ShoIG] Ryuto.23 Like the painter of the scroll, Shbjui Ryucto sees the three great patriarchs of the Asian philosophies as something other than heroic model figures. His commentary is tinged with irony. To be sure, the Three Sages are first praised for their virtues, but then derided for their helplessness as three sailors aimlessly drifting in a boat. Then however, the Zen master points out the mutually inspiring fusion of the Three Creeds going back to the beginnings of all things and creating a unity which suspends all opposites and lets the Three Creeds radiate like the sun above all other heavenly bodies. The ecumenical ideal of the ultimate similarity between Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism did not, however, always meet with the approval of all Zen masters. Dbgen (1200-1253) criticised the idea with strong words: Of late, shallow-minded monks in the land of Sung [Song] ...] study the doctrines of Lao- tzu [Laozi] and Chuang-tzu [Zhuangzi], arguing that these are the same as the Way of the Buddhas and patriarchs. Some stress the unity of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. They argue that the three are like the legs of a tripod vessel which cannot stand upright if it lacks even one leg. The folly of such views is beyond belief.24 Yet, the escape from the fetters of doctrinary, confessional, and other limitations often found artistic expression in two other subjects: the "Three Vinegar Tasters" (Chin. san- suan, Jap. sansan), and the "Three Laughers of the Tiger Ravine" (Chin. Huqi sanxiao, Jap. Kokei sanshb). Both themes were favourite motifs of Zen artists, who painted them often and with sensitive humour. No matter if the "Three Vinegar Tasters" are interpreted as Sakyamuni, Confucius, and Laozi or as the famous Song literati Su Shi (Dongpo, 1036-1101), Huang Tingjian (1045-1105) and their priestly friend, the Chan monk Foyin from the Jinshan Monastery, they demonstrate in allegorical form the essential identity of the three philosophies by tasting vinegar from the same pot: to each, the drink tastes dif- ferent, although objectively it is the same liquid. The most attractive extant version of the "Three Vinegar Tasters" is by the painter-monk Reisai, who was probably active in the middle of the fifteenth century at Tbfukuji in Kybto, and who seems to have participated in an official mission to Korea in 1463. The picture, painted in powerful, controlled, confident brushstrokes in ink on paper, shows the three old men standing around a ceramic pot, fully concentrated on their tasting test with closed eyes and protruding lips (Fig. 4). The scroll, now in the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, is signed by the artist in the lower right corner and bears a motto seal reading Kyaku tobjitchi, "Plant one's feet on solid ground". A monk called Ya'un Eits&amp;, otherwise unknown, inscribed the scroll with the following prose poem: 20 :. .se i I % ''; Fig. 4 The Three Vinegar Tasters, Sansan, by Reisai (active mid- 15th century).

The "lotus clock" referred to in the fourth line of the poem is actually a water clock con- structed of lotus leaves. It is said to have been devised by Huiyuan's disciple Huiyao on Mount Lu. The man of Han [T'ao YOan-ming, Tao Yuanming or Tao Qian, 365-427], the old Taoist from Chin [Lu Hsiu-ching, Lu Xiujing, 406-477], and the monk of Tai [Hui-yuan, Huiyuan, 334-416]! A marvelous thing, marvelous indeed! In one place, intimate together. Ah, each one a sage! But inadvertently, suddenly (... owing to the stuff that makes up the wine ...) the vat holds a great treasure. The three creeds become a single doctrine. Oh, oh, good gracious! You there! Tiny beetles! Can it be true? The men endure the sour taste and knit their brows, standing face to face in silence. A dominant religion is an affliction to man. Playfully written by Ya'un.25 To the great surprise of the three sages, the wine has turned to vinegar. Instead of the expected enjoyable tasting, they are jolted to bitter reality. To make matters worse, they discover small beetles in their wine cups. This is an allusion to an old Daoist theme which has the three masters recognize themselves in the beetles, making them realize the rel- ative value of their doctrine within the infinitely large receptacle of this world. Historically, the "Three Laughers of the Tiger Ravine" may be the oldest of these three allegorical themes. Already the writings of the famous Chan painter, monk, and poet Guanxiu (832-912) contain the story of the poet Tao Qian (Yuanming), the descendant of a Confucian family and symbol of the individualist hermit; the Daoist magician and philo- sophical formalist Lu Xiujing; and the important patriarch Huiyuan. When Huiyuan entered the Donglin Monastery on Mt. Lu on the southern bank of the Yangzi river in 384, he vowed never again to leave the holy monastery precinct and thus never to enter the pro- fane world of desire and defilement. One day, however, Tao Qian and Lu Xiujing came to visit him, and when he accompanied his two famous guests back to the threshold of the holy precinct, lost in stimulating conversation, he inadvertently crossed the bridge of the Tiger Ravine which separated the monastery from the outer world. At that moment, they heard a tiger roar, and immediately Huiyuan realized he had unconsciously broken his vow. The three men acknowledged the faux pas with resounding laughter, realizing that not even the most rigid barriers and resolutions can withstand the power of spiritual free- dom and purity. After Guanxiu, another eccentric artist seems to have taken up the humorous theme of the "Three Laughers of the Tiger Ravine" in the second half of the tenth century. It is said that Shi Ke used the motif to decorate a wall of the house in which the great statesman, poet, historian, and archaeologist Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072) is supposed to have lived. Su Dongpo, a younger contemporary of Ouyang, traditionally is thought to have written a verse on this wall painting. Unfortunately, nothing is left of that painting. But we do know some very good Japanese ink paintings, dating to the 15th century, of this popular Zen allegory, e.g. a scroll now in the Hosomi Collection, Osaka,26 by the Zen priest ChO'an Shinkb who lived around 1450 in the Seirai'an of Kenchbji in Kamakura (Fig. 5), or another one, in the Powers Collection, New York, by the Zen painter Bunsei who was active at about the same time and seems to have had close ties with Daitokuji in Kybto (Fig. 6).27 Yet another work of the same theme by an anonymous painter of the late fifteenth cen- tury, formerly in the Asano Collection, Tokyo, carries inscriptions by four Zen monks. Ten'in (Moku'un) Ryutaku (1422-1500), the 218th abbot of Kenninji in Kybto, makes the following comments on the theme in his poem: A man in a Taoist hat, a man in Confucian shoes in the style of Chin [Eastern Jin Dynasty, 317-420]; As the lotus clock marks the passing hours, the old ones gather to visit at the lonely hermitage. Near Wulao Peak [one of the southern peaks of Lushan] the monk's wizened face is the first to break out in laughter. The three men together, saying nothing of it, together cross the bridge.28 21</page><page sequence="20">In Japan, religious figure painting inspired by Daoist and Confucian, but especially by Zen Buddhist sources is called doshakuga, in contrast to traditional cult painting of orthodox Buddhism, called butsuga, and ideal portraits of Zen patriarchs, soshizb/zu, as well as Zen priest portraits, which are usually called chinzd (also chins6). Translated literally, doshakuga means "paintings explaining the way [to enlightenment]". In a wider sense, however, it means "Daoist (do) and Buddhist (shaku; in a compound with another char- acter Shaka, i.e., ?ckyamuni) painting (ga)". Zen paintings of this kind usually are didac- tic. The figures adapted from Confucian history and legend, as well as from the abundant Daoist pantheon, also acted as models of behaviour.

His successor Daoxin wrote the text for the epitaph. According to his traditional biographical dates, the fourth patri- arch would have been only twelve years old at that time. Daoxin's biography, too, will thus have to be revised. Cf.

Fig. 7 Huike Showing his Severed Arm to Bodhidhar- ma, Eka danpi, by SesshG Thyd (1420-1506), dated 1496. Detail. Sainenji, Aichi Prefecture (No. 17). According to legend, the "wordless transmission" of Zen began on Vulture Peak near Benares, when the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, in front of his assembled followers, answered an important question of faith by silently raising a flower to his chest and turn- ing it between his fingers. Among his disciples, only Katyapa understood that the Buddha's gesture symbolized the highest truth, and he expressed his insight by smiling. In China, the school of Chan began with the Indian monk Bodhidharma (Chin. Puti Damo, Jap. Bodai Daruma, died before 534), the last in a line of 28 Indian patriarchs. He was followed by the Chinese Huike (Jap. Eka, 487-593), Sengcan (Jap. Sosan, died 592),29 Daoxin (Jap. Dbshin, 580-651), Hongren (Jap. Kbnin, 601 -674), and Huineng (Jap. E'no, 638-713). But after the fifth patriarch, dramatic rivalries concerning the correct transmis- sion of the doctrine and irreconcilable contradictions in basic, theological questions led to a division into a Northern and a Southern School. At the risk of over-simplification, it might be said that the conflict arose because Shenxiu (Jap. Jinshu, 606?-706) saw the way to enlightenment in "gradual awakening", while Huineng postulated "sudden awakening".30 At least officially, Huineng emerged as the winner in this rivalry and was nominated the successor to the fifth patriarch. During the following centuries, his disciples created the final, historically decisive version of Chinese Chan. The school flourished during the Tang Dynasty (618-906); during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), it spread further and was systematized and partially re-formulated. Emperor Ningzong (reigned 1194-1224) in- stitutionalized the hierarchical order of the five most important Chan monasteries of Hangzhou and Mingzhou in modern Zhejiang Province into the "Five Mountains", wushan, - the model for the Japanese gozan of Kamakura and Kyoto - which exercised powerful influence as living centers of Zen Buddhist culture and art.31 It was at this stage in its development that the meditative school of Buddhism found its way to Japan. The first contact of Japanese Buddhism with the continental Chan movement - itself still young at the time - can be traced back to the seventh century, when the Hosso monk Dosho (629-700) travelled to China and met Huiman, the disciple of the second patri- arch, Huike. During his eight-year stay on the continent, Dosho was introduced to the teachings and religious practice of the new school by the experienced, well-travelled Xuanzang (600-664). In the following centuries, sporadic contacts of this kind were continued, Zen scriptures reached Japan, and the practice of meditation - already embedded in the Tendai and Shingon school - increasingly gained significance. Nevertheless, Zen Buddhism was not formally established in Japan until the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century. At first, a group of three priests trained in China familiarized the monastic communities of Japan with three different mainstreams of continental Chan: the reformer MyOan Eisai (1141 -1215), who was fascinated espe- cially with the ideas of the Huanglong (Jap. Oryo) branch of the Rinzai school; the learned Risshuc master Shunjo (1166-1227), who had studied intensively the Yangqi (Jap. Yogi) branch of the same school; and the religious philosopher Dbgen Kigen (1 200-1253), who concerned himself above all with the tenets of the Caodong (Jap. SOto) school.32 Their 25</page><page sequence="23">own disciples and successors continued the pioneering work, supported by high rank- ing Chan masters brought from China such as Wu'an Puning (Jap. Gottan Funei, 1179-1276), Lanqi Daolong (Jap. Rankei DoryO,1213-1278), Wuxue Zuyuan (Jap. Mugaku Sogen, 1226-1286), Yishan Yining (Jap. Issan Ichinei, 1247-1317), Mingji Chujun (Jap. Minki Soshun, 1262-1336), Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (Jap. Seisetsu Shocho, 1274-1339), and Zhuxian Fanxian (Jap. Jikusen Bonsen, 1292-1348). They were crucial to the rise of the gozan, the five great Zen institutions of the Rinzai school in Kamakura and Kybto, as well as to the spread of meditative Buddhism across the whole country, for they were adept at securing the favours and the material support of influential politi- cal figures for their religious purposes and projects, as well as for their monasteries. Especially the members of the Hojo family, above all Tokiyori (1227-1263) and his son Tokimune (1251 -1284), appointed by the Shbguns in Kamakura as Shikken or regents, were imbued with deep religious devotion, despite their political and military influence. While on his deathbed at the young age of 34, Tokimune received, on the fourth day of the fourth month of 1284, the monk's robe, the tonsure, and the Buddhist "apprentice" name Doko from the founding abbot of Engakuji Wuxue Zuyuan, whom he had invited from China. The physical appearance of the two dynamic imperial administrators Tokiyori and Tokimune, both of whom died young, has come down to us in two impressive por- traits at Manganji, Kumamoto Prefecture, in which they are shown, not as political regents, but as masters of meditation in plain monk's robes and with shaven head.33 Beside their commitment to Zen Buddhism, the Hojo regents were knowledgeable con- noisseurs of the arts. The congeniality of Zen and the Japanese chivalric ideal, the rigid discipline and death-defying self-contempt demanded by both, the mutual stimulation and promotion of cultural, diplomatic, commercial, and political matters has often and rightly been cited. All of this was crystallized into its most sublime form by the mutual stimulation of those worldly potentates and their religious partners of the Zen school. The first Chinese masters of meditation who came to Japan, as well as the eager Japanese Zen followers who, in order to study at the source, took upon themselves the arduous sea journey to China, almost without exception brought back with them to the monasteries of Japan - beside the fruit of their spiritual education - writings and paint- ings, religious certificates and portraits of their teachers, monk's robes and other pre- cious objects. It is hardly surprising that the treasures imported from China stimulated the desire to collect, and very soon precipitated a wave of imitating or copying among the art-loving Japanese monks. This is true especially in the case of the Rinzai Zen monks. In contrast, adherents of the Soto school seem to have been less interested in such reli- gious and cultural paraphernalia. Dbgen, who had no thought of founding a new school in Japan, returned home with practically empty hands. He is said to have received, just before returning to Japan in the fall of 1227, only a portrait of his revered teacher Changweng Rujing (1163-1228), the monk's robe of Furong Daokai (died 1117), and two writings from the hand of the founding patriarch Dongshan Liangjie (807-869). Rujing discharged his studious Japanese disciple with the exhortation: Since you are from foreign lands, receive these things and prove your faith by them. Once returned to your homeland, spread the doctrine and help the people. Do not live in towns and villages. Keep away from kings and ministers. Hidden deep inside the mountains and valleys, keep company with but very few, and thus see to it that our school will not come to an end.34 Dogen took the advice of his master to heart. He was concerned above all with the real- ization of the true teaching by indefatigable sitting in meditation, zazen, by a disciplined and abstemious life, as well as by the true transmission of the intellectual and spiritual patriarchate. He was not, however, an uncritical admirer of the Chinese. He mentioned with disappointment the lack of discipline in some monasteries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the spreading erosion of Zen Buddhist order rules and mores. For instance, he said that the monks constantly watched for an opportunity to beg for a portrait or a statement of faith from their masters, for the sole purpose of superficially documenting their right to succession, without really having attained enlightenment at all. It may be that Dogen's 26 33 Helmut Brinker: Die zen-buddhistische Bildnisma- lerei in China und Japan. Munchener Ostasiatische Studien, Vol. 10.

Dbgen and his followers loved solitude and the seclusion of the mountains. Unlike the important Zen centers of the Rinzai school of Kyoto and Kamakura, the monasteries of Dbgen's school did not lie within easy reach of the art-saturated atmosphere of the great metropolitan centers. Daibutsuji, the main temple of the SOtO school, erected in 1244 for Dbgen and later known as Eiheiji, "Monastery of Eternal Peace", was situated in a remote spot in the old province of Echizen (modern Fukui Prefecture). Only one winter, in 1247/48, was Dogen able to endure Kamakura, where he had reluctantly accepted an invitation of Hojo Tokiyori. Except for Dbgen, none of the important representatives of the Soto school can be found in the genealogical temple chronicles until the sixteenth cen- tury, other than two Chinese monks: Dongming Huiri (Jap. Tomin E'nichi, 1273-1340), who came to Japan in 1308 at the invitation of Hojo Sadatoki (1271 -1311) and was appointed 10th abbot of Engakuji and 18th abbot of Kenchbji, and his compatriot Dangling Yongyu (Jap. TOrin Eiyo, died 1365). The latter became 31st abbot of Kenchbji in Kamakura in 1355, and two years later, in 1357, he was appointed to the highest posi- tion of Engakuji in the 26th generation, after heading Tenryutji in Kybto as third prelate (1351) and Nanzenji as 23rd abbot (1352).

Fig. 8 Dense bamboo grove at Tbfukuji, Kybto, sym- bolizing the "Meditation Grove', zenrin, a term for Zen monasteries used to this day (Photo H.B.). A Buddhist monastery usually is called ji or tera (dera), a character that is pronounced si in Chinese and originally designated a "court", an administrative authority or the seat of a government agency. The Buddhist meaning probably developed sometime in the first centuries A.D., when missionaries immigrating from central Asia were accommodated together with foreign dignitaries and diplomatic missions in the official buildings of the honglusi, the "Court for Dependencies" or an Imperial Agency of Foreign Affairs. This bureau, already in existence in the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577), was in charge of the reception and lodging of foreign tributary envoys. Later on, the honglusi became a "Court of State Ceremonial" being also responsible for state funerals and other important court rituals.35 Thus, the layout of Buddhist monasteries borrowed much of the design of Imperial palace buildings, administrative structures and residences. Because Indian monastic grounds originated as temporary shelters for itinerant monks in the parks and gardens of wealthy laymen, monasteries were also called "groves", fin in Chinese and rin in Japanese. Zenrin, "meditation grove", is the abbreviation of zenmon sorin, "dense grove of the gate to meditation". The phrase alludes to the close commu- nal life, similar to a dense grove, of the Zen disciples in a monastic community (Fig. 8). Indisputable Tang sources make no mention of independent Chan monasteries. Terms such as chansi, "meditation monastery", or chanyuan, "meditation cloister", do not occur. Only from Song times onward, masters of meditation and their followers would congre- gate in flourishing monastic establishments of a special Chan lineage. Masters of medi- tation and their coteries were collectively referred to as chanmen (Jap. zenmon), [people who entered the] "chan gate". Individual Zen monks were called chanseng (Jap. zensd), "meditation monks", chanhezi (Jap. zennasu), "meditation reverend", or chanjialiu (Jap. zenkeryO), "members of the Chan family". A very general term for monastery is dojf, a word used today especially by Western Zen adepts for their meditation centers. Translated literally, dojb means "place [in which one follows the] path [of Buddha]", an abbreviated form of the phrase bodai ddjd (Skr. bodhi manda). This concept refers to the spot under the Bodhi tree where Sakyamuni attained Enlightenment and thus "completed the path", jodo, by implication "a place of attaining Buddha Nature", a place at which the Buddha is worshiped and his teachings are practised. Japanese texts concerning Zen Buddhism contain many unusual, special readings of Chinese characters, most of which can be traced to Chinese pronunciations dating to the Song Dynasty. And it can be said generally that the great Chan institutions of the con- tinent exerted an overwhelming influence on all aspects of meditative Buddhism in Japan.36 This is true for the hierarchy of the monasteries as well as for their infrastruc- ture. The gozan, the "Five Mountains", comprised toward the end of the reign of the Emperor Go Daigo - on the basis of a ranking established between 1334 and 1336 - Nanzenji (Daitokuji), Tbfukuji, and Kenninji in Kybto, as well as Kenchbji and Engakuji in Kamakura.37 It was there that the Shikken of the Bakufu, leaders of the powerful military government headed by the Hojo family since the beginning of the thirteenth century (1203), had introduced the systematization and centralization of the gozan system after the model of the Chinese Zen monasteries during the Song Dynasty. Over the centuries, 29</page><page sequence="27">Jit! lz~~~r,&lt;,?~~9 r~Daitokji&gt;-X ' ig;~~~~~~~~~~W maSbk AlN O t c=IR. k-bX SArl lnrl Fig. 9 Map of Kybto with the "Five Mountains", gozan, the great Zen monasteries. the ranking and grouping of these Zen elite monasteries were changed several times. Hosokawa Yoriyuki (1329-1392) and Shiba Yoshimasa (1350-1410), the powerful advis- ers, kanrei, of the third Ashikaga Shbgun Yoshimitsu (1358-1408), altered the gozan ranking by placing Kenchoji in Kamakura at the top, followed by Engakuji, Jufukuji, Jochiji, and Jbmyoji. To these corresponded, in Kyoto, Tenryuji, Shbkokuji, Kenninji, Tbfukuji, and Manjuji. By shogunal decree, Nanzenji in Kybto, closely connected with the Imperial court and with state power, was placed above the "Five Mountains", gozan shi jo (Fig. 9). Shiba Yoshimasa, himself an ardent Zen adherent, persuaded the Shogun Yoshimitsu, following the well proved Chinese model, to transfer part of the administrative duties to the gozan monasteries themselves, and to create a special post for this purpose, the scroku, "Registrar General of Monks". The Chinese senglusi, "Central Buddhist Registry", was a government agency in charge of monitoring the numbers, qualifications, and con- duct of Buddhist monks and nuns under the supervision of the honglusi, "Court of State Ceremonial".38 The 39th abbot of Nanzenji, Shun'oku Myoha (1311-1388) (Fig. 71), a dis- ciple of the great Zen master Muso Soseki (1275-1351) and spiritual confidant of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his consultant Shiba Yoshimasa, was the first to be appointed to this post and received the title tenka scroku. When the Shogun had the Rokuon'in erected on the precinct of Shbkokuji in 1383, the central administrative bureau of all Zen monasteries was established here, and the important post of the scroku came to be called Rokuon scroku. Shun'oku Mybha was succeeded by such eminent Zen masters as Zekkai Chu-shin (1336-1405) and Kukoku Myoo (1328-1407). Their tasks included the control over the nomination of the abbots in a relatively quick rotation system, promo- tions within the monks' hierarchy, organization of ceremonial events, as well as the preparation of documents for trade and diplomacy. 30 38 Hucker: op. cit., No. 4949, p. 405.</page><page sequence="28">39Foulk: op. cit. (1993), p. 157. After the "Five Mountains", gozan, in the political power centers Kyoto and Kamakura and the "Ten Monasteries", jissetsu or jissatsu, there was the third rank of the complex and multi-layered system of the monastic organization of the Rinzai school across the whole of Japan, the "Many Mountains", shozan, supported by influential and wealthy provincial families. Here, too, ranking and listing often changed. In 1380, the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu had the list of the jissetsu drastically revised and six more monasteries were added to the original ten. This was the end of the Chinese model of ten, and the term jis- setsu had become a purely nominal ranking category. As a result of this decree, many ambitious and powerful provincial monasteries applied for the prestigious status and the number of newly registered, important Zen centers rose quickly: toward the end of the fifteenth century no fewer than 46jissetsu were in existence. At the outbreak of the Onin war in 1467, there were more than three hundred Zen monasteries in this complex and well developed gozan organization across Japan. Former abbots who had retired from the administrative affairs of large Zen monasteries would often erect smaller cloisters at the periphery of the central precinct, so-called tatchO. These can usually be recognized by the character an or in at the end of their name. The monks in charge of such cloisters or hermitages were called tassu. In China, such structures originally stood by the tombs of the abbots and important monks of a Chan monastery. The monks living in them were responsible for the maintenance of the tombs and the rituals in honour of the deceased masters. During the fifteenth century, some of the tatchO in Japan were wealthier and more influential than the main monastery to which they belonged. Were one to count the tatchO and branch monasteries, matsuji, the total number of Japanese Zen monasteries would amount to several thousand. 1. Ranks and Tasks At the top of the monastic hierarchy was the abbot, called jOji or chor6. He had to be a "spiritually perceptive and morally praiseworthy person".39 During the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, the abbot was appointed by powerful political figures such as the Emperor himself or the retired monarch, the ShOgun or the Shikken, the regent of the Bakufu. The appointment of the abbot of Nanzenji, Daitokuji, and Myoshinji in Kyoto was for many years the privilege of the Imperial House, while the Kujo branch of the Fujiwara family reserved the right to appoint the abbot of Tofukuji. After the establishment of the position of "Registrar General of Monks", scroku, in 1379, the abbots of the numerous official Zen monasteries across the country were either appointed by that central author- ity, or by the "Commissioner for Zen and Ritsu Monasteries", zenritsugata. The monk communities themselves had practically no influence on the selection of their abbot. As a rule, the new abbot was installed with a festive inauguration ceremony, ju'en, often in the presence of the highest political dignitaries. Eligible for the abbot chair were monks who had attained the rank of a shuso, "chief seat", in the "western hierarchy", seihan, of the monastic order of precedence. To reach that level, a monk had to pass an examination known as hinpotsu, "holding of the fly whisk", given twice a year. During this examination, the candidate (usually an advanced monk holding the rank of a "su-tra keeper", zcsu, "secretary", shoki, or ordinary shuso) would take the place of the abbot and engage the younger members of the monastic commu- nity in a spiritual Zen discourse. If the examination was passed successfully, the abbot would bestow upon the jisha a certificate, jago, authorizing the new "senior acolytes" to instruct younger novices in meditation and other monastic exercises. During the fifteenth century, such certificates are said to have been forged sometimes, or obtained by bribe. In his capacity as the person responsible for the meditation sessions, the occupant of the "chief seat", shuso, was allowed to sit beside the abbot on the meditation pedestal; hence his title. In large halls, this task was often assumed by two priests: one, as zendc5 shuso, was assigned to the monks in the front of the hall, the other, godci shuso, to those in the rear. For the care of holy scriptures, their acquisition and appropriate storage, a monk well versed in Buddhist texts was appointed as zcosu, "suitra keeper". He was assisted by the "secretary" or "scribe", shoki, who had to be an outstanding master in the art of writing to accomplish his task of brushing the monastery's official documents, 31</page><page sequence="29">such as internal announcements or reports to the abbot. He was also in charge of the official correspondence with public authorities, benefactors, and other monasteries. Other positions in a large monastery included the shika, "guest prefect", who saw to the well-being of official visitors, lay followers, and wandering mendicant monks; the "bath prefect", chiyoku, whose responsibility was the discipline and order in the bathhouse, yokushitsu; and the chiden, "hall supervisor", in charge of the cleanliness and decoration of the monastic buildings, especially during official festivities and ceremonial events. All these positions are listed in the "western hierarchy", seihan. Corresponding to the seihan was the "eastern hierarchy", than, with six positions, rokuchiji or "six administrators", whose duties were the discharge of economic and financial affairs. The main responsi- bility in this sphere was assumed by the "treasurer", tsubun. Under the supervision of the "prior", tsusu, the "comptroller", kansu, and his assistant, fusu, kept the books and administered the annual budget affairs. Since the last two were responsible for the daily supplies such as clothes, incense, candles, paper, ink, and brushes, as well as of food, they worked in close contact with the "chief cook", tenzo, and the shissui, the "labor steward" in charge of repairs and maintenance. The "registrar", inc, who organized the daily schedule, supervised discipline, and drew up the official report of new monks and guests, functioned at the same time as chanter of invocations during the spiritual ser- vices.40 2. Titles and Names The most renowned Zen prelates had an honorary title, "Master of Meditation", zenji, or "National Master", kokushi, bestowed on them by the Imperial House at the time of their death, in some cases even during their lifetime. This practise followed a custom which had been observed in China for centuries. There, Shenxiu (606?-706), the ambitious founder of the Northern Chan School, was the first to be honoured with the posthumous title Datong Chanshi, "Greatly Penetrating Chan Master" by the Tang Emperor Zhongzong (656-710, reigned 705-710). In the entire history of Chinese Buddhism it was only the second such imperially granted honorary title, the first since the beginning of the fifth century. In Japan, it was the Chinese Zen teacher Lanqi Daolong (Jap. Rankei Doryut, 1213-1278) from present-day Sichuan Province who received the honorary title "Master of Meditation" for the first time. The young ex-Emperor Kameyama (1249-1305, reigned 1259-1274) - a great supporter of Zen throughout his entire life, who received tonsure himself in 1289, and endorsed the founding of Nanzenji on the grounds of the palace built after his abdication - designated Rankei Doryut Daikaku Zenji, "Greatly Illuminated Zen Master". The title "National Master" was used in China already during the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577), in Japan during the fourteenth century. Emperor Hanazono (reigned 1308-1318), a fervent advocate of Zen, honoured the meritorious founder of Tofukuji Enni Ben'en (1 202-1280) 32 years after the latter's death (1312) with the title Shoichi Kokushi, "National Master of the Holy Oneness". (Fujiwara) Kujo Michi'ie (1192-1252) is said to have addressed him respectfully in this manner already during Enni's lifetime. Young candidates for entry into the monastery, so-called kasshiki or katsujiki, who had not yet received tonsure, were sometimes placed into the personal custody of the abbot at a tender age. They would grow their hair to shoulder length and dress in colourful silk robes. When they became novices, shami, their head was shaven, teihatsu or teizu (also teitc), but they were not yet allowed to participate in the strenuous meditation exercises. Soon after they made their monastic vows and received the black robe symbolizing their acceptance into the monastic community, their Zen master would give them a "Name of the Law", hcki, selected in respectful view of the continuation of the doctrinal tradition and complemented by a dogo, "Name of the Path". In order to display the tradition's lineage clearly, the priest's name consisting of four char- acters often contained one character of the master's name, or his predecessor's. Early entry into a monastery was by no means rare among children of influential families dur- ing the Middle Ages in Japan. Thus it is said that Shun'oku Mybha (1311 -1388), e.g., a nephew of the preeminent Zen master Muso Soseki (1275-1351) and his closest disciple for life, was placed under the monastic guardianship of his uncle already at the age of two.41 Muso bestowed on him the "Name of the Law"' Mybha, "Mysterious Bloom" con- 32 40 For further information cf.

In this, he continued the custom of name-giving initiated by his own master Koho Kennichi (1241 -1316) and thus documented the transmission of the doctrine "from mind to mind" unbroken for generations. Not until after the death of his master did Muso change this convention and often use the epithet shu, "encompassing, widely spread". Probably the first to be named thus was Ryutshuc Shutaku (1308-1388), another novice of Muso Soseki, at the age of eight. Shutaku means "vast swamp", but it seems that the novice did not like his new sobriquet: he felt that the name put him at a disadvantage vis-&amp;-vis other Muso disciples, especially toward Shun'oku Myoha, three years his junior. He changed his name himself to Myctaku, "mysterious swamp", although respect for his master required him to retain his official "Name of the Law" Shutaku.42 When Myoha was 35 years old and had reached the rank of shuso, occupant of the "chief seat", Muso Soseki brushed for him the name Shun'oku, "Spring Abode", in large cursive characters (No. 40). In the spring of 1346 he presented his nephew with this scroll, together with a dedicatory poem written in elegant semi-cursive script. At the age of sev- enty-one, Muso had relinquished his duties as abbot of Tenryutji and settled in the Ungo'an at Nishiyama. In 1335, Emperor Go Daigo (reigned 1318-1339) honoured Muso, while still alive, with the title "National Master", Kokushi, and six other monarchs followed his example subsequently.43 Worldly Zen adepts, koji, usually also had a "Name of the Law" like their priestly confreres, but in their case it is mostly called zenjcmon, "Gate of Meditation". 3. Monk's Robes Abbots and monks of the gozan monasteries wore robes of various colours according to their rank. Ordinary priests had black robes and a black surplice, kesa in Japanese (Skr. kasaya) (Fig. 10). Abbots of the numerous shozan monasteries in the provinces had per- mission to wear coloured cords and a ring, kan, at the surplice. The heads of fissetsu monasteries, the next rank in the hierarchy, were allowed to wear a yellow kesa over the black monk's robe. The prelates of the great gozan institutions in the imperial capital Kyoto and at the seat of the military government in Kamakura had the privilege to wear yellow robes. The highest ranking monastery, Nanzenji, enjoyed special prerogatives due to its close connection with the Imperial House; its abbots had the exclusive right to wear purple robes. The second-ranking Tenryutji, too, had a special perquisite: the monks were allowed to wear robes of a somewhat paler purple hue. As a rule, a monk would have three robes, sanne, at his disposal. He would wear the for- mal attire, scgyari, sometimes also known as "great robe", dai'e, during official recep- tions outside the monastery and on his mendicant rounds. For internal events, such as ceremonies and readings in the monastery, he would don the uttaraso or j'e, "the supe- rior garment". For everyday use by day and night, for work and sleep, he would use the anda'e or nai'e, the "under garment". The kesa worn above the robes were originally a patchwork made of old, often precious pieces of material (Nos. 32-34). According to the number of their parts, kesa were assigned to various categories and ceremonial ranks. Most common are the "five, seven, nine, and twenty-five piece surplices", gojogesa, shichijbgesa, kujogesa, and nijugojogesa. From the beginning, it was a common practise among masters to hand down to the des- ignated successor the robe and the alms bowl as sacred insignia of the patriarchal sys- tem. Old sources and a number of early ordination paintings give vivid testimony to this religious act of initiation.44 Being presented with the master's kesa ultimately meant receiving the true doctrine, as Dogen, who was particularly intent on the strict adherence to the practical monastic rules, explains in his work Kesa kudoku, "Merits of the KaRaya Surplice". Heinrich Dumoulin writes: "The enlightenment attire turns into the cult robe owned by all monks in the Zen monastery. Dogen speaks with great reverence of the power inherent in it and explains of what material a ka~aya surplice must be made, what colours it may have, what shape it can take depending on the event for which it is worn. The shape for work in the garden or in the fields differs from the shape for a religious cer- emony. 33</page><page sequence="31">4 Vr ~~K jc*s " - :fi~~~~~~~~~~t: ~. The ka$sya surplice is always worn with signs of reverence. The monk is never to forget that he receives this stole ultimately from 8&amp;kyamuni himself. Washing it is virtually an act of worship during which incense and flowers are used, and the monk prostrates himself. The famous ka$aya poem is recited: Oh how wondrous is the garment of deliverance Like a boundless realm of happiness! We expound the doctrine of the Perfect One, Vowing to save all living beings. Toward the end of the chapter, Dbgen mentions some of his personal experiences in China. Next to him sat a Chinese monk who paid his respect to the ka$aya surplice every morning by laying it on his head, folding his hands, and reciting the ka$aya poem. 'I felt a joy never known before, tears of emotion moistened the collar of my garment', Dbgen recalls. At that moment, he pledged to teach his countrymen, after his return, the 'kasaya surplice correctly transmitted by Buddhas and patriarchs, together with the true Dharma'."45 Many Japanese Zen monks returned from their studies in China with the monk's robe or the kesa of their master, and they wore these garments, ennobled by the patina of long, devout use, with great reverence since the garments allowed the monks to remain in physical contact with their spiritual forefathers and to immerse themselves as deeply as possible in the stream of religious tradition. Two poems may show how important was 34 Fig. 10 Zen monks of Tdfukuji in their black robes, on their way to the ritual aim begging, takuhatsu. Fig. 11 The First Six Chan Patriarchs of China.

To this day, the ritual of putting on the kesa includes the reveren- tial laying of the stole on the head and the chant- ing of the appropriate gatha.

The first was composed by Gido Shushin (1325-1388), one of the most esteemed literati of the "Five Mountains": Cotton Robe Szechuan [Sichuan] brocades, Chiangsu [Jiangsu] damasks, Fukien [Fujian] gauzes - Elegance isn't measured by the number of robes one has; Over and over my seams rip and I sew them up again, Heat and cold come and go - they don't bother me.46 Another poem about a well-worn monk's robe, by the 23rd abbot of Shbkokuji Sei'in Shunjb (1358-1422), conveys loving affection and sublime disregard of superficial imper- fections, but at the same time also slight censure of the predilection for colourful imported textiles in some Zen monasteries: Rundown Robe We've been through a lot a years together, grimy with dirt and grease: So what if it lets in the wind and cold at night? I've grown partial to the way it hangs, as only a poet could - Better than a palace robe cut from Chinese cloth!47 The Zen monk RyushO Shutaku's (1308-1388) evident belief in magic had its roots in his early contacts with the "secret doctrine", mikkyd, and the mystic rituals of the Shingon school in his home province Kai. According to the Honchd kosdden (chapter 35), he is said to have received the kesa of the Chinese Chan abbot Wuzhun Shifan (Jap. Bujun Shiban, 1177-1249) from the master himself. This precious garment, nijlgojogesa, sewn together of twenty-five brownish-yellow and blue silk fragments embellished with gold ornaments, is commonly known as dmu'i, "garment [received] in a dream"48 in memory of the Nanzenji monk's dream; it is today one of the treasures of the Kyoto National Museum. Before leaving Rinsenji in the Saga Arashiyama district northwest of Kybto, Muso Soseki (1275-1351) wrote in 1339 the "Rinsenji House Code", Rinsen kakun. It is a behaviour codex in the widest sense for monasteries and monks after Chinese models such as the "Pure Rules of Huanzhu", Huanzhu qinggui (Jap. Genfl shingi), issued by Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) in 1317 for his monastery, the "Illusory Abode", Huanzhu'an.49 In his Rinsen kakun, Muso Soseki admonishes his disciples to heed the ideal of simplicity and warns them of ostentatious, costly ritual ceremonies and, in article 25, of the use of precious robes: The furnishings and equipment of the monastery should all be modest, and the clothing of monks must be not luxurious. Luxury not only interferes with the pursuit of the Way; it also invites robbery.50 H.B. 35</page><page sequence="33">36</page><page sequence="34">V Zen Aesthetics and Theory of Art 51 Cf.

The mutual influence between spiritual and artistic currents of Zen Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism - emphasized above and indeed apparent everywhere -, as well as the exaggerated application of Zen to all situations of life in recent times has sometimes led to the denial of the existence of a specific Zen art, especially in China, where the Neo- Confucian element in this amalgam is often given more weight. This denial may be viewed as a welcome broadening of the often narrow view of many authors, but one should not lose sight of the essence of Zen in this cleansing process. To be sure, there is no defi- nite Zen style, certainly no unambiguous Zen Buddhist style of writing or painting, no gen- erally valid laws of form or structure, no established iconographical canon, and even the identification of Zen art with the rough, spontaneous writing and the abbreviating, evoca- tive ink painting developed in China during the thirteenth century and prevalent in Japan about a hundred years later is too simple and one-sided, not to say misleading. Zen writ- ing and Zen painting cover a much wider range of artistic manifestations, methods, tech- niques, themes, forms, and styles, and it is difficult to isolate the characteristic Zen qual- ity of a given work. Zen architecture, sculpture, writing, and painting are not clearly separate, detached, and defined categories of East Asian art; rather, they have to be viewed within the context of the general art history of China and Japan on the one hand, and of the overall evolution of Buddhist art in East Asia on the other. Japanese architects could rely on well-proven models in Chinese, as well as on age-old domestic designs and principles of sacral architecture, and sculptors followed the styl- istic pattern of other Buddhist schools rather faithfully. Painters had at their disposal a rich trove of artistic means and styles created and refined by generations of artists. To be sure, they often used these tools in surprising and unconventional ways and new contexts, in keeping with the freedom and general openness inherent in the Zen spirit. Thus, a well established academic style of painting might be used for an unmistakable Zen theme, and out of this unorthodox synthesis might result something quite new, i.e., a work of Zen art. On the other hand, painters working out of their personal religious experience and free from the constraints of orthodox criteria would use the heterodox methods and media of eccentrics - vehemently condemned by traditional Chinese art critics - for themes borrowed from traditional Buddhist art. In such paintings, it was precisely the consciously imperfect, unpretentious, and spontaneous elements which imbued high aesthetic and religious values in the Zen adept. In Japanese Zen monas- teries as well as among the art-loving political rulers favoring them, this kind of writing and painting was highly regarded and eagerly treasured. To a much a greater extent than was the case in China, influential Zen personalities in Japan have shaped the spiritual and cultural realm of the whole country and brought their artistic and aesthetic principles to bear on the secular domain as well. What are these aesthetic principles?51 To begin with, all artistic creations in the Zen spirit and skills that matured into "ways", do, - especially the "way of writing", shodb, and the "way of tea", chadb - are striking for their elementary sense of artless simplicity, objec- tivity, and purity, for their natural unbridledness and arresting directness, as well as for their deep respect for nature. In his book Zen to bijutsu,52 the contemporary philosopher 37</page><page sequence="35">and profound student of Zen, Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, has suggested seven qualities of equal value which distinguish a work of Zen art. They are: asymmetry, fukinsei; simplicity, kanso; unadorned loftiness, kokb; spontaneity, shizen; spiritual depth, yugen; unworldli- ness, datsuzoku; inner serenity, seijaku. These characteristics give a good idea of the essential qualities of a work of Zen art. Some of them refer beyond aesthetic values to moral and religious ideals, and at the same time they adumbrate the basic tenets of an attitude toward art which separates Zen from the orthodox schools of Mahayana Buddhism. In the following, we shall try to sketch the basic principles of this specifically Zen Buddhist attitude toward the arts. In Zen Buddhism, cult images in the traditional sense play as little a part as classic Mahayana sitras. After all, Zen is looking for "independence from holy scriptures" and a "special transmission outside traditional doctrines". Thus, Zen Buddhism developed volu- minous genealogical and hagiographic writings. In addition, a great Zen master's "Recorded Sayings" (Chin. yulu, Jap. goroku),53 usually compiled posthumously by dis- ciples, enhanced the unadultered "transmission from mind to mind" since they revealed most clearly his enlightened character and his exemplary disposition, much like the por- trait paintings with the dedications written by the subject himself and other "ink traces" (Chin. mofi, Jap. bokuseki) by the hand of a Zen master. Ultimately, it is the handwritten testament, much more than the always inadequate attempt at an effigy, that unveils the master's nature and spiritual essence to the disciple, that "points directly to the mind of man" and thus keeps alive the invisible presence of the spiritual model beyond time and space. Already traditional Chinese art theories call signatures on ancient masterpieces of writ- ing or painting "seals of the mind", xinyin. These theories emphasize the possibility to enter into virtually mystic contact not only with the work, but with its creator, by medita- tive empathy and the aesthetic act of re-creating, rushen, "to penetrate the spirit" in such a way that the viewer and the viewed object would fuse into one. This intense experience of "complete absorption" was also called shenhui, "spiritual communion", by the literati of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Rushen "is a state of absolute concentration in which, as in shenhui, an object is grasped through total identification, and this practice is cer- tainly close to Ch'an."54 Above all in Zen circles, painting and writing were approached in this way; the viewer was drawn into an astonishingly complete experience cycle exceeding the actual work of art and directly involving the artist himself. The poet Huang Tingjian (1045-1105), who was in close contact with Chan masters of his time, and greatly admired for his writing in medieval Japan, remarked on the subject: At first / could not appreciate painting, but then by practising meditation (ch'an) / came to understand the efficacy of effortlessness, and by studying Tao / realized that perfected Tao is simple. Then when I looked at paintings I could completely understand their degrees of skillfulness and quality, grasping their details and penetrating their subtleties. But how can one discuss this with those who have seen little and heard less?55 Since all educated people are conversant with the handling of ink and brush, and famil- iar with the rules and means concerning the creation and judgment of a work of art, a true understanding of art emerges; idea and form, content and technique, rank and sig- nificance, tradition and innovation are gauged on the basis of certifiable optical values. For the Zen adept, the old masterpieces are living traces of the artists, testaments of his spiritual ancestors, and thus visible signs for the threading into the complex weave of the religious and cultural traditions of his school. Untainted by the passage of time, the works of art thus provide contacts and spiritual ties between congenial spirits, between mas- ters and disciples. Nothing is further from a Zen adept's mind than to reach his religious goal by worshiping a cult image, or to let himself be guided by an esoteric ritual, a liturgy following strict rules, in which rigidly circumscribed symbols are condensed into a compulsory sign language. If one were to characterize concisely the attitude of Zen Buddhism toward art, especially toward unequivocal religious themes in painting, one might use the answer of the first Chan patriarch Bodhidharma to the Liang Emperor Wu's (464-549, reigned 502-549) question after the "Ultimate Meaning of the Holy Truth": Kuoran wusheng, "Open dis- 38 Fig. 13 The Sixth Patriarch Tearing up a SOtra, by Liang Kai (active first half 13th century).

These striking words stand at the beginning of the Biyanlu, the "Blue Cliff Record".56 The well-known work contains one hundred "test cases", koan, compiled by Xuedou Chongxian (980-1052), which the Chan master Yuanwu Keqin (1063-1135) originally discussed in front of his pupils, although hardly with the intention of having his comments published one day together with the examples. Dahui Zonggao (1089-1163) most likely thought he was acting in the spirit of his master when he burned the Biyanlu in a demonstrative act against the copious abundance of Zen writings. But there were already copies other than Dahui's in existence, and the hints, examples, and eulogies of the text have thus come down to us. How radically and vehemently Zen turned against traditional scriptures and the cult of images may be gleaned from some other examples. Various sources confirm that the sixth patriarch Huineng could neither read nor write. During the dispute concerning the succession of the fifth patriarch, Huineng's rival wrote a poem on the wall of the monastery's corridor during the night; when Huineng wanted to reply, he had to ask a monk with whom he was friendly to write down his verse. A mag- nificent painting, attributed by tradition to the famous Song academy painter Liang Kai (active first half of 13th century), but thought by some experts to be a Japanese copy, drastically shows the deep-rooted Zen Buddhist aversion to scholastic dependence on texts.57 The scroll shows an old, dishevelled monk, probably the sixth patriarch Huineng, as he tears a suitra to shreds with great delight (Fig. 13). Another Chan monk, Deshan Xuanjian (died 865), seems to have followed that example when he destroyed all his sitras in a fire upon attaining enlightenment. Although not all masters were skeptical that cult images contained a holy substance, the eccentric Chan master Tianran (738-824) from Danxia, of whom several Zen writings tell truly astonishing episodes, made no secret of his contempt for images. Not only did he startle his contemporaries sometimes by feigning to be deaf or dumb, but he truly scan- dalized them when, in sacrilegious disdain of all monastic rules, he climbed a Buddhist statue. On another occasion, when he encountered very cold weather while staying overnight at Huilinsi, he made short shrift with a wooden image and burned it to warm himself. When the abbot of the monastery demanded an explanation, Tianran replied that he planned to obtain Buddha relics, sardra (Chin. shell, Jap. shari), in the form of the ashes. The abbot was indignant: "But how can you get relics from an ordinary piece of wood?" Upon which the monk from Danxia retorted: "If it is nothing more than a piece of wood, why should you upbraid me [for burning it]?" Yintuoluo, a Chan painter-monk probably from India who seems to have been active especially in the east-Chinese coastal region during the first half of the fourteenth century and whose full priest name was Fanyin Tuoluo, rendered this anecdote in a painting of great humor. The small ink painting, now mounted as a hanging scroll and preserved in the Bridgestone Museum (Ishibashi Collection), Tokyo, is most likely a section from a longer handscroll with simi- lar exemplary Zen episode (Fig. 14) 58 The narrative of the painting is expounded once again in the short inscription by the renowned Chan priest Chushi Fanqi (1297-1371). His seven-character quatrain has been translated: At an old temple, in cold weather, he spent the night. He could not stand the piercing cold of the whirling wind. If it has no farira, what is there so special about it? So he took the wooden Buddha from the hall and burned it.59 The monk from Danxia does not act in blind iconoclasm when he burns a Buddha statue to warm himself; rather he questions the belief, for orthodox Buddhists a dogma, in the inherent hypostatization of the absolute in a cult image and ridicules the popular worship of relics. Zen is quite tolerant of Buddha and Bodhisattva images, but does not consider them to be sacrosanct. Thus, when Tianran climbs on a cult statue, he only displays, candidly and provocatively, the elimination of awe, his indifference to and his inner inde- pendence from the consecrated, holy image. To him, effigies - even those of the Buddha - are ephemeral and ultimately doomed attempts to render visible and tangible the true Buddha Nature, buddhata, or to capture it in personal likeness. Zen used effigies rather to represent the great masters of meditation, the founders of monasteries or "mountain openers", whose portrait sculptures have been preserved in many Zen monasteries up to 39</page><page sequence="37">the present. Apart from these, however, there are practically no important examples of Zen Buddhist sculpture. Generally, one may see an inclination toward an-iconism, lack of images, in mature Zen, without, however, deducing a general animosity toward such images. Painted portraits of Zen masters are usually executed with impressive care for detail and the prelates wear robes of elaborate richness. But except for portraiture Zen painting is fundamentally different from orthodox Buddhist painting. The latter's cultic splendour and radiant colours, its golden sumptuousness, as well as its strictly hierarchic, precisely cal- culated, iconographically circumscribed, abundant pantheon is contrasted in Zen paint- ing by unpretentious spontaneity disregarding established conventions, a virtually as- cetic, but firm and decisive rigor of forms, objectivity, and austerity, as well as by simple artistic means renouncing perfection, virtuosity, and luxuriousness. These attributes are further enhanced by modesty and plainness in the choice of the painting's subject matter and its material, and a preference for empty, unpainted space in the painting. Such empty space is more than just an aspect of artistic composition, more than just unpainted ground. Ultimately, it is of the utmost significance in understanding Zen, since it symbol- izes the "void" or "nonsubstantiality", ?unyata (Chin. kong, Jap. ku), free of form, colour, and any other characteristics. The empty ground of the painting is seen as identical with the empty ground of Being and thus satori, i.e., the absolute truth on the highest level of insight. The profound influence of Chan Buddhist thought and terminology on Neo- Confucian Song literati may be seen in a statement by Mi Youren (1072-1151), who wrote in a self-conscious appraisal of his psychological condition during the act of creation: My condition in the world is like that of one hair in the ocean, tranquil and colorless. Often in quietness I sit in meditation and forget all the worries of the mind and share my wan- derings with the emptiness of the blue void.60 Mi Youren's colophon is thoroughly imbued in content and wording with the detached Chan Buddhist outlook of his day. It was precisely in this context that such values as tran- quillity, colorlessness, or blandness, pingdan, to use one of his father's key terms, the absence of perfection in favour of naturalness, ziran or tianzhen (also tianran), were able to generate and embody high aesthetic and religious standards in the mind of Chan adepts and literati alike. Naturalness is allied to the predilection for the "emptiness of the blue void". The tenfold Zen parable known as the "Oxherding" theme has been popular since the eleventh century in numerous versions both in poetry and painting (Nos. 18, 41). It serves the disciple as a spiritual and visual guide and as a signpost in his search for enlighten- ment. The parable compares the gradual process of maturing on the path of Zen in ten stages with the search and capturing of an ox thought lost by an innocent herdsman but finally found. As a simile for the oblivion of oneself and the ox, the absence of any desire or intent, or, to put it differently, for the "view of one's own nature" leading to "becoming Buddha", the eighth step shows an empty circle. "Open distance - Nothing sacred"! Bodhidharma's answer to the question concerning the "Ultimate Meaning of the Holy Truth" immediately springs to mind again. Beside providing the Zen adept with exemplary models as help for his own efforts, Zen works of writing and painting had a secondary, decorative function when they were used as sliding doors, fusuma, or screens, bydbu, to embellish the rooms of a monastery, or in their role as "tea paintings", chagake, acting as the aesthetic focus of a refined cultural and social ritual, characterized by the ideal of simplicity and serenity, the tea ceremony, chanoyu. The ideal place to display a painting - usually a single hanging scroll, but some- times also a pair or a triptych - was the alcove, tokonoma, where it could be viewed from a certain distance in an atmosphere of intimate concentration (Fig. 12). This was the most congenial environment for the aesthetic art experience, the spiritual communion with the creator of the work, the absorption of its spiritual-artistic purport, of its idea, its content and form. A painting or writing is to be encountered not as an object; rather it is to be approached and reverently viewed in silence as a living, precious creation with which one enters into sensory and spiritual communion. When selecting a work of art for the tokonoma, one might refer to the season or to the taste of a special guest.

Works of art that are permanent fixtures often become decorative blurs, precluding any spontaneous and fun- damental reaction to their artistic and possibly religious content. For reasons of conser- vation, the great monasteries in Japan hang scrolls from the massive beams of the great halls for "airing", mushiboshi, every year on dry and cool days in autumn. This ancient custom remains to this day a rare opportunity to see the great treasures of a monastery. During the Muromachi period (1333-1573), it was a popular practice in art-loving Zen circles, among painters, adepts of writing, and tea masters, in the monasteries as well as among the keepers and owners of the Ashikaga Collection, to combine a religious figure painting with two suitable "ink traces" or seemingly secular paintings and thus create a triptych. Subsequently, this was also done with older Chinese works. For the central piece, a dominant Zen Buddhist saviour figure, such as the historical Buddha "a-kya- muni Emerging from the Mountains", Shussan Shaka, or the "White Robed Kannon", Byaku'e Kannon, seated in an attractive landscape setting, would be selected, and then complemented by flanking side pieces such as writings, landscapes, scroll pairs show- ing tiger and dragon, birds and flowers, or monkeys. In the Gyomotsu on'e mokuroku, the inventory of Chinese paintings in the Ashikaga Collection in Kyoto, compiled at the time of the eighth Shbgun Yoshimasa (1435-1471) by Nbami (1397-1471), his artistic advisor, ddbdshO, and curator, a number of such trip- tychs are listed. Among the best known extant examples are: three hanging scrolls in the Daitokuji, Kybto, by the Chinese painter-monk Muqi (died between 1269 and 1274) show- ing a white-robed Bodhisattva Guanyin, a crane, and a monkey holding a young one in her arms (Fig. 16);61 the painting of Shussan Shaka by Liang Kai, flanked by snow land- scapes (No. 1, Fig. 15);62 another picture of "8akyamuni Emerging from the Mountains" by an anonymous Japanese painter living at the time of the fourth Tbfukuji abbot Haku'un Egyb (1228-1298) was also matched with two paintings, in this case of plum blossoms IN~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</page><page sequence="39">(No. 2, Fig. 17); Haku'un Egyb added inscriptions on all three scrolls;63 a triptych of Byaku'e Kannon floating on a lotus leaf in the centre, and two blossoming plum branches, one of which is heavily covered with snow, attributed by tradition to the obscure Muromachi painter Isshi (active first quarter 15th century).64 Although triptychs with images of the Buddhist pantheon in the center were a common theme of religious figure painting in China, subject combinations of the above kind seem not to have existed on the continent; the tolerant ambiance, however, characterized by mutual stimuli, among the literati and Chan monks of the Song period might very well have led in this direction. Monkeys and cranes were a well established pair in traditional Chinese litera- ture with an accumulation of meanings and associations. A dialogue between the Chan master Xuedou Chongxian (Jap. Setchb Juken, 980-1052) and one of his disciples might shed some light on this question. The 37th abbot of Lingyinsi near Hangzhou, Dachuan Puji (1179-1253), recorded the cryptic dialogue in his "Original Assembly of the Five Flames", Wudeng huiyuan (Jap. Goto egen), of 1252: Fig. 16 White-robed Guanyin flanked by a crane and monkeys, by Muqi (died between 1269 and 1274). Daitokuji, Kybto. The disciple asked: "What is the great meaning of the Buddhist doctrine?" The master spoke: "The five colours of the auspicious cloud" [The disciple] said: "Your pupil does not understand." The master spoke: "The limitless infinity above our heads." Question: "How was it here before the time Bodhidharma came?" The master spoke: "Monkeys screeched in old trees." [The disciple] said: "And how was it after the coming of Bodhidharma?" The master spoke: "Cranes shrieked into the blue skies. "65 The secondary combinations in Japan, too, allow certain conclusions concerning the way in which Zen Buddhist art connoisseurs and believers understood such works in the four- teenth and fifteenth centuries: they saw their revered Buddhist saviour figures in close connection and intimate harmony with nature, the landscape, animals, and plants. They were, after all, manifestations of the Buddha Nature according to Zen thought. Thus, the 53rd abbot of Daitokuji, Toyo Eichb (1428-1504), wrote in his poem for a now lost Shussan Shaka painting: "The plum blossoms outside the village gates, too, completed their way."66 Similar hints can be found in the "Eye-Treasury of the True Dharma", Shobigenzo, Dbgen's (1 200-1253) fundamental Zen instructions compiled during the last two decades of his life. The 59th volume of this monumental opus bears the title Baige, "Plum Blossoms". At the beginning of this volume, Dbgen expounds an allegory about an old plum tree with which his revered Chinese master Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) used to instruct his disciples. The Japanese master emphasizes in great detail the significance of the plum blossom as metaphor for the highest level of Enlightenment, mujo shogaku, of Sakyamuni: 42 63Tanaka Ichimatsu: Ka'o, Moku'an, Mincho.

Once, my late master said to the monks: "When Sakyamuni lost his ordinary sight and attained enlightened vision, one branch of a plum tree bloomed in the snow. But now small branches have appeared and the beautiful blossoms laugh at the spring wind blow- ing wildly."[...] A plum tree blooming in the snow is the manifestation of the udumbara-flower [which 85kyamuni held up before Mahjkj?yapa]. We have the opportunity to see the Eye and Treasury of the True Law of the Tathjgata in our everyday life. Yet most of the time we lose the chance to smile and show our understanding. However, my late master has transmitted the principle of a plum tree blooming in the snow and that clearly reveals the Enlightenment of Buddha. The wisdom of Enlightenment is the supreme wisdom, and if we study the plum blossoms more deeply we will undoubtedly realize this. A plum blos- som is the observation that "Above the heavens and throughout the earth I am the only honored one" - each thing is the most honored thing in the world.[...] Snow must cover the earth and the earth must be full of snow. No snow, no earth. When snow covers the earth it is the enlightened eye of the venerable Sakyamuni. We should know that flowers and the earth transcend life and death. Since they tran- scend life and death the enlightened eye transcends life and death. This is called the supreme Buddhist Enlightenment. The right time to comprehend this is when one branch of a plum tree blooms in the snow. Flowers and the earth are the life beyond life. "Covered with snow" means all over, back and front. The entire world is our mind, the mind of a flower. Consequently, the entire world is a plum blossom, i.e., the eye of Sakyamuni Buddha. 67 43</page><page sequence="41">Many of the poems and painting inscriptions recorded in the anthology Baika muJinzo, "The Inexhaustible Plum Blossom Trove", by the Zen priest Banri Shukyui (1428-1503) contain allusions of this kind.68 Together with Gyoku'in Eiyo (1432-1524), he wrote a laudatory poem full of associations with traditional Chinese concepts on a painting called "Plum Valley", Baikei (also "Plum Field", Baiya) now in the Seikado Bunko, Tokyo. 69 The symbolic association with the purity of the enlightened spirit made the plum blos- som an enduring part of Zen literature and painting. As one of the "Three Pure Ones", sanding, Jap. sansei, it was added to bamboo and rock and firmly established in that popular triad. Already during the Song and Yuan dynasties, the plum blossom was one of the "Three Wintry Friends", suihan sanyou (Jap. setsuri sanyO). In a farewell message of 1355 to a friend, the Chinese scholar Hu Han made a direct allusion to the three com- panions of the cold season with "the increasingly rare examples of scholars who remained faithful to their Confucian convictions after 'the world had been thrown back to the primitive age, and gentlemen's caps and gowns were being stepped on in the mud and ashes'." He explained: The gentleman respects the pine for its chastity, the bamboo for its straightness, and the prunus for its purity. 70 Thus, the vision of a white sea of plum blossoms was connected with the purity of untouched snow, with winter, and, in the widest sense, with the uninterrupted continuum of life through the hardest season. Sakyamuni had endured six years of ice and snow in the lonely mountains before he returned to the world to preach his doc- trine. In that sense, the two Rikkyoku'an plum blossom paintings (Figs. 127-128) as well as the two winter landscapes by Liang Kai - i.e., purely secular subjects, one would assume at first sight - fit perfectly well with the religious theme of Shussan Shaka. Nor should we forget that concepts such as "ice" and "cold" were adopted by Buddhism as metaphors for tranquillity from later Daoism. Aesthetic-artistic concepts correspond harmoniously with fundamental religious ideas in this case; secular and religious themes reach a symbiosis, and ultimately their borderlines vanish completely in the realm of Zen. Since the middle of the fourteenth century, Japanese artists in Zen circles seem to have created a number of triptychs which were intended as such from the beginning in order to demonstrate visually the essential non-difference between the profane, this-worldly sphere and the absolute. The oldest extant work of this type is by the Zen painter-monk Yui'e Gukei who is known to have been active between 1361 and 1375. It is a Byaku'e Kannon painting imbued with unadulterated spontaneity and devout simplicity, to which are joined two equally natural ink landscapes with fisherman and woodcutter on each side respectively.71 Kano school copies indicate that the "Rainy Landscape" by the same painter in the TokyO National Museum was also flanking a central Byaku'e Kannon paint- ing, together with another landscape now lost.72 About a century later, around the middle of the fifteenth century, the Zen painter-monk Chu'an Shinko of the Seirai'an at Kenchoji in Kamakura painted three hanging scrolls in ink on silk united in a triptych, today in the Sanso Collection (Prof. and Mrs. Peter F. Drucker) (Fig. 18).73 The central scroll shows the white-robed Kannon seated on a rock in the gush of waves. Behind the rock, a stencil-like decorative and yet startlingly realistic sea of waves extends to the faraway horizon near the upper edge of the paint- ing. The expanse of waves together with two circular, transparent halos around head and body lend the Bodhisattva, deeply immersed in meditation, a wondrous "open dis- tance" and other-worldliness. These qualities are enhanced even further by the densely structured, compact landscape paintings on both sides, blocking off the viewers eye and directing him inescapably toward the central image. The left scroll shows the celebrated Tang poet Li Bai (Taibo, 701 -762) seated in front of a waterfall; on the right is the equally famous poet Tao Qian (Yuanming, 365-42 7) standing by a mountain river. Both poets are turned toward the strangely unreal, yet so close, apparition of the Bodhisattva. They show due reverence, but are not awe-struck. They seem to be direct- ing their gaze toward the deity's face. The stylistic unity of all three scrolls, and their mutual relationship within the composition suggest that Ohui'an Shinkb conceived of this unusual work as a triptych. 44 68Tamamura Takeji, ed.: Gozan bungaku shinshu.

Sansd Collection (Prof. and Mrs. Peter F Drucker), Claremont, CA. A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~l It seems as if the medieval painter-monk intended to bring the two luminaries of the past into historical proximity with the Bodhisattva Kannon, who in Zen thought does not dwell at an unapproachable remove. He places the Bodhisattva literally "side by side with the two historic figures, most likely to emphasize the non-difference between Sacred and Profane, between other-worldliness and this-worldliness, between nirv~jna and sas~ra. Although such thoughts must be considered speculation in the light of the fact that no specific comments or statements by the painter-monks concerning the question are extant, triptychs of this type nevertheless strongly invite an interpretation of all three paintings as a closed unit in the spirit of Zen.

(1976), pp. 55ff. Fig. 19 Sparrow on Rock and Bamboo, by Ka'0 (active first half 14th century). Detail. Yamato Bunkakan, Nara (No. 47, Photo H.B.). Zen Buddhism and its art have always remained fundamentally averse to any kind of for- malized symbolism. Before Zen painting, there were only diffident attempts to use purely abstract, difficult symbols. "It may even be said that Zen seeks to transcend any kind of traditional symbolism and thus attains a new symbolism on a higher level. Significantly, however, these symbols of a higher rank are precisely the most ordinary things chosen quite at random from everyday life."74 The Zen adept is quite receptive to such tran- scended symbols, to suggestive abbreviations and ciphers, to unconventional meta- phors and allegories - whether through the medium of writing, or by observation of nature and objects -, and to the representation of the various saviour figures, reverent patri- archs, and masters in either tangible portraits or in anecdotal episodes. Works of Zen art try to ease the immediate advance toward the ultimate insight, to open the adept's eye to the essence of things, and to proclaim the great history of the uninterrupted, living tra- dition of its own school. In contrast to classic Mahayana art, Zen art consciously renounces the effort to render numinous personifications or symbols of the absolute with majestic redemptive efficacy transmitted into the painting itself. Instead, Zen art turns to inconspicuous, common- place things of this world, to natural things within the life and experience sphere of com- mon people: animals, flowers, fruit, stones, and the all-encompassing landscape. In this approach, the painting assumes a completely different religious function with much more accessible reference to reality. The Zen work of art is largely free of the official character and claim to objectivity in the sense of numinous presence and magic-cultic substance of orthodox Buddhist painting. It turns subjective and becomes an evocative opposite of the one viewing it. It is testament to the spiritual origin, document of personal ties and experience, encouraging hint toward the goal of enlightenment, certificate of attained mastery, or catalyst for private exercise and emulation. In comparison with works of eso- teric Buddhist art, or with the art of the popular Amitabha school, Zen works appear soberingly this-worldly, de-mythologized - indeed, they are often hard to recognize as works of art with religious implications. They partake of "Open distance - Nothing sacred". The circle, yuanxiang in Chinese and ensb in Japanese, has been of old a central com- ponent in various concepts of Zen Buddhist thought. Already the third Chinese patriarch Jianzhi Sengcan (died 592), in his Xinxinming (Jap. Shinjinmel), "Inscription on Relying on the Mind", talks about "the circle which is equivalent to the 'Great Void'; nothing is amiss, nothing superfluous", yuan tong daxu wuqian wuyu. As "perfect manifestation" and as shape without either beginning or end, the circle comprises the elimination of all opposites into absolute unity and thus into the "true void", zhenkong (Jap. shinkO). The circle is the symbol of the shapeless, colourless essence of all beings, the "original countenance before birth", ziji benlai mianmu, of which is said in the "Gateless Barrier", Wumenguan: "Even when one paints it, it is not painted."75 Zen Buddhist ecclesiastics seem to have developed a method of teaching and learning based on the multilayered symbolism of the circle already early on, a heuristic and specu- 47</page><page sequence="45">lative approach. Huizhong (died 776) was allegedly the first Chan master to employ the metaphor of a circle to explain the essence of true enlightenment to his disciples. Toward the end of the Tang Dynasty, this idea was further developed by the Guiyang school into a complicated, dialectic system of 97 circle symbols intelligible only to the initiate and somehow connected with six generations of Chan patriarchs as well as with the popular "Oxherding" theme, as can be deduced from some biographies of Guiyang monks. Three complex series of different circle symbols, partly also using the ox simile, are expounded in the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall", Zutangli or Chodang chip of 952, reflecting the teachings of the Korean master Sunji (829-893).76 Dongshan Liangjie (807-869), who is said to have attained enlightenment at the moment he saw his mirror image reflected on the surface of a stream, developed a theological system known as the "Five Ranks", wuwei (Jap. go'i). These five stages of practice leading to enlightened emptiness were metaphorically explained by circles divided into segments ranging from pitch-black to snow-white.77 Such abstract symbols in black and white may have consequently inspired similar Zen concepts. The "circles" or ensb, frequently outlined in bold traces of the brush by mas- ters of the Zenga, a movement in Zen Buddhist art which gained momentum from the seventeenth century onwards, and the so-called Kurukuru no mi'ei, "Round-and-Round Venerable Images [or Portraits]", may reflect a residual influence of ancient operations with "circular figures". lsshi Bunshu (1608-1646), a proficient painter-monk, epitomized the nature of enlightened consciousness in a compact silhouette of the red-robed Bodhidharma enclosed in a black circle, and the celebrated tea master and calligrapher Kobori Enshui (1579-1647) provided a short eulogy for this ascetic image.78 In a kind of intuitive naevet6 Isshi reduced the back view of the meditating patriarch with two con- centric brushstrokes to the simplest, most elemental components. He was close to the courtier Kono'e Nobuhiro (1593-1643), the adopted son of Nobutada (1565-1614), an outstanding writer, calligrapher, and a remarkable painter. For his Daruma depiction he may have been inspired by Nobutada's bold and rough style of ink painting devoid of any overt technical virtuosity. In a picture of the same subject Nobutada delineated Bodhi- dharma with utmost artistic economy and suggestive efficiency.79 The concentric quality of this ideal Daruma portrait, drawn in one single continuous sure brushstroke, has inspired the pertinent denominations of such images, Kurukuru no mi'ei or Ippitsubyb no Daruma, "One Brushline Bodhidharma". With a short verse, in Chinese, Nobutada rein- forced the simplicity of conception and the powerful expression of the meditating Chan patriarch: Quietness and emptiness are enough To pass through life without error. 80 A similar focused Daruma image in the Okayama Bijutsukan is abbreviated in such an extremely simplified manner, that it seems to suggest a giant abstract cipher (Fig. 20).81 It is also based on one of the most popular and enduring Zen legends concerning Bodhidharma's "wall-contemplation". As a result of his unproductive dialogue with the Liang Emperor Wu the Indian founder of the Chan school in China is said to have gone north to the state of Wei, where he spent nine years in deep unmoving meditation facing a rock wall at the Shaolin Monastery on Mt. Song. This Menpeki Daruma zb, "Picture of Bodhidharma Facing the Wall", is created with one dark, decisive brushstroke of power- ful rhythm and evocative spirit that delineates the bold silhouette of the seated meditat- ing patriarch. Comparable qualities are present in the inscription above written from left to right because Daruma appears to face to the left. Therein the eccentric Zen master Ikkyu Sbjun (1394-1481) questions the efficacy of Bodhidharma's austere practice of fac- ing a rock wall for the sake of penetrating into the true inner nature of his Self. There is a definite overtone of skepticism and even critical reluctance in the poem which has been recorded in Ikkyu's major collection of literary works entitled KybunshO, "The Crazy Cloud Anthology": Who expects peace of mind to come of itself? In the ancient days spiritual splendor filled the Shaolin [Monastery]. The merit achieved by facing the wall made him faceless, Unaware of the snow piling up deep in the whole courtyard. 48 ....... ..... . ... . ... . . .. . .. ............;; i Fig. 20 Bodhidharma Meditating Facing a Cliff, Men- peki Daruma, by Bokkei Saiyo (active mid- 75th cen- tury), with an inscription by lkkyO Scijun (7394-1481).

Respectfully eulogized by the "Crazy Cloud" KyOun, [and] "weary cassock" rannO, Sojun.82 Impetuously written with a broad brush fully charged with dark ink, Ikkyi inadvertently omitted the last but one character for "courtyard" in the right line of his poem and added it afterwards in small, thin script to the right. Errors of this sort can be occasionally observed in his restless, rapid movement of mind, hand, and brush. The hanging scroll with "Bodhidharma Facing the Wall" in the Okayama Bijutsukan is stamped in the lower right corner with a square relief seal Bokkei. It appears together with a round relief seal Saiyo on several other paintings which seem to reflect a consistent individual style and a predilection for abstract calligraphic qualities in the definition of form (No. 13). The strong, yet playful brushwork and the dramatic contrast of dark ink with the empty ground are successfully employed in this Menpeki Daruma. The image is reduced to a rough outline. It shows Bokkei's distinguished achievement in using the simplest of means to maximum effect. The tradition of these seemingly awkward but masterfully-controlled "One Brushline Bodhidharma" images can be traced back to the late fourteenth century. The Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, owns a hanging scroll with an en face representation of Bodhidharma in meditation inscribed and most likely also painted by the old Zen abbot Shokai Reiken (1315-1396) in 1394 (No. 9).83 For some reason the colophon is not to be found in his collected works posthumously published under the title SekibybshO, "Stone Screen Anthology". But there is a reference in a commentary on his eulogies to a Kurukuru no mirel, "Round-and-Round Venerable Image". This technical name of the austere ideal portrait devoid of any superfluities indicates and emphasizes the playful character of the brush movement. Hence such pictures are sometimes also called giga, "playful paint- ings". More tangible here than in other Zen pictures is the act of creation. The sensitive viewer is immediately able to re-create in his aesthetic experience the essentials of form by following the tip of the artist's brush from the center in circles and wavy movements through changing accents, with more or less pressure and momentum down to the end at the lower left corner. The painting is thus an unusually legible record of its own cre- ation. Although medieval Zen artists seem to have devoted no more than sporadic attention to this sort of circle symbolism they used the ensb primarily in portraiture. A triple portrait of distinguished Tofukuji abbots in three generations shows Enni Ben'en or Shoichi Kokushi (1202-1280) in the centre flanked by his disciple Zozan Junku (1233-1308) on his left and Daido Ichi'i (1292-1370) on his right in a window-like circle (No. 28). It is prob- ably more than mere coincidence that the word en, "round" or "circle", figures prominently in the name or honorary title of at least two of the "Three Patriarchs in One Circle", ichi'en sanso. In the Tofukuji founder's name Enni Ben'en it occurs twice, and Zozan Junku is identified by a short inscription at the top of the scroll as Enkan Zenji, "Zen Master of the Round Mirror". Since the sixth abbot of Tbfukuji was respected as the embodiment of ultimate "tranquillity and illumination", jakush6, he came to be seen by posterity as an incarnation of Enzu Daishi, the "Great Master of Round Penetration", one of the names of the Bodhisattva Kannon. Enzu is the perfect wisdom of enlightenment which pene- trates to the ultimate essence of all existence. The anonymous fifteenth-century artist, probably a painter-monk of the prolific Tofukuji atelier, was aware in all likelihood of the complex implications of the circle. He depicted the three half-figure images as if they were surrounded by a luminous round halo, brought about by a light gray ink wash evenly spread around the perimeter of the rest of the silk scroll. The painter succeeded in lend- ing a transparent holy aura to the three Zen prelates and in making them appear as vision- ary manifestations in a round mirror. Dai'enkybchi is the "Great Round Mirror Wisdom", 6darsajijna in Sanskrit, a stage of perfect enlightenment that resembles a clear mirror reflecting all phenomena in their true, complete state. And yet, images reflected in a mir- ror are ultimately nonsubstantial. The "nEssential Teaching of the Expedient Means of Pacifying the Mind and Entering the Path", Rudao anxin yao fangb/an famen, attributed to the fourth Chinese Chan patriarch Daoxin (580-651), expounds this in the following passage: 49</page><page sequence="47">When a mirror reflects a face, it may be perfectly distinct, but this is an image (lit. a "shadow of the form") manifested in space, and there is not any "thing" within the mirror. You should understand that a person's face does not enter into the mirror, nor does the mirror enter into the person's face. One should understand by this detailed considera- tion that mirror and face fundamentally do not exit or enter or go or come. This is the meaning of Tathagata (ju-lai [rulai], "Thus-come One").84 The ambiguous idea that the round mirror is a perfect symbol for the original true mind of the enlightened master and that it metaphorically describes the illusoriness of phe- nomenal reality may have guided the painter and the sitter of a portrait in the Masaki Museum (No. 30). It depicts Ikkyu Sojun (1394-1481) in a round half-figure image accom- panied below by Lady Shin or Mori, the blind paramour of the celebrated Zen master's later years. The first two lines of his poem, in Chinese, dated 1471 are significant in our context and may be translated: Within the "Great Circle" dai'ensb, appears the entire body. This painting expresses the true features of Xutang [Zhiyu]. Ikkyu was an ardent admirer of the great Song master Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269), the Chinese patriarch in the Daitokuji lineage who had transmitted his teachings through Nanpo Jbmin (Daib Kokushi, 1235-1308) to Japan. IkkyO considered himself as a sev- enth-generation descendant of Xutang. Because of dreams of his disciples it even came to be believed that Ikkyu was a reincarnation of Xutang. In spirit and vision, he totally identified himself with the original Song master so that he inscribed several portraits rep- resenting himself in the outward appearance of Xutang Zhiyu (Fig. 114). This fusion of two personalities in body and mind is called isshin ddtai, "the same substance in one body". Although the dai'ensbzb of the Masaki Museum is a half-figure portrait, Ikkyu declares that his "whole body", zenshin, appears within the "Great Circle". Thus the image has to be understood as a complete reflection of his true Self in a round mirror identical with the manifestation of his spiritual forefather. In conclusion we may safely assume that the circle and the round mirror were apt symbols for the "insight into one's own nature" in Zen painting, poetry, and calligraphy. "The direct pointing at the mind of man" which precedes vision of "the original countenance before birth" is embodied in this unusual chinzb. Although a considerable number of portraits representing Ikkyu Sojun have survived, he may have had reservations concerning the efficacy and validity of religious effigies. In a short poem on "Deluded Enlightenment" he once uttered that "the being's innate mind is the path to delusion".85 Nevertheless, he was often portrayed in the idealized round form of the classical Chinese mirror. One of the best ensbzb is the hanging scroll in the Yamato Bunkakan, Nara, which bears at the bottom center the faint square seal impression of the enigmatic painter Sekiyb, literally "Red Fly" - a rather strange name for an artist (Fig. 21).86 In his coarse unconventional hand Ikkyu wrote a disillusioned commentary full of frustration on it: The Buddhist Law of Daito [Kokushi, 1282-1337] has lost its splendor. Who still is now [teaching true Zen] at the Ryuhbzan [in the Daitokuji]? Sons and grandsons of the Eastern Sea [Japan] will after a thousand years only with bitterness recite the poem of [the mid-ninth century Tang poet] Xu Hun. IkkyO, [who] formerly [resided] at the Daitokufli]. 87 Ikkyu repeated this poem - in the classical versification of four "regulated lines with seven characters", shichigon zekku,- several times: twice in vigorous, stylistically closely-related calligraphies that have been preserved at the Itsub Bijutsukan, Osaka,88 and in the col- lection of the Idemitsu Museum of Arts,89 and another time in an exceptional work in the Fujita Art Museum, Osaka (Fig. 22).9? Here the verse accompanies the name of the author brushed with great self-assurance in two bold characters on the lower half of the hang- ing scroll. In this composition it replaces the actual likeness and becomes a handwritten aniconic self-portrayal. More than any lifelike painted image, the uninhibited traces of his brush succeed in generating an immediate genuine image of his original Self. The dogO or priest name lkkyQ bestowed upon him by his austere religious teacher Kaso Sbdon (1352-1428) in 1418 literally means "tOne Pause" or "sA Rest". It harks back to a basic idea 50 84 McRae: op. cit. (1986), p. 140. 85 Sonja Arntzen: IkkyD and the Crazy Cloud Antho- logy. A Zen Poet of Medieval Japan.

Just as Ikkyu ignored basic monastic codes of conduct in his life-style or as he bent and broke the rules of Chinese prosody at will in his poetry, he paid here no attention to commonly respected conventions of portraiture and writing. By turning the established calligraphic formula forjigo or "confirmation names" upside down, he arrived at the compositional pattern for chinzd or formal Zen portraits. The most pertinent symbol - or rather: non-symbol - for the "insight into one's own essential nature" in Zen painting is the empty ground. "The immediate pointing at the mind of man", which precedes the view of the "original countenance before birth" in the fundamental Zen maxim already quoted several times, is demonstrated in a humor- ous ink painting at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, by the Japanese Zen painter-monk Moku'an Rei'en, active in China from 1325 until the end of his life in 1345 (Fig. 23). The scroll bears a seven-syllable quatrain by the renowned Chan master Liao'an Qingyu (1288-1363): Strange light at the tip of his finger reveals his true form. Though the stomach is great, the eyes are already dazzled; He wanders to many places, visiting families of his own clan; He tries to push his bag, but it does not move. Inscribed by the monk, biqiu, Qingyu of the Benjue [Monastery].93 Moku'an practiced under Liao'an Qingyu after 1333 at the Benjuesi in Jiahe north-east of Hangzhou. Emulating a painting - most likely Chinese although sometimes attributed to Moku'an94 - of the historically authenticated mendicant monk Budai (Jap. Hotei, died 905 or 916), Moku'an painted the cheerfully gallivanting, bald-headed old man as he points laughingly with his raised hand into the void above him. The other version of the same subject was inscribed by Pingshi Ruzhi (1 268-1357) after 1329 when he was in res- idence at Mt. Tiantong. It makes the meaning of the pointing gesture more obvious by showing a small halo with a tiny Buddha figure seated inside at the spot to which Hotei's finger points. It is the "original countenance" of Budai, a reference to his state of enlightenment, and at the same time to Maitreya, the future Buddha, as whose avatara or human incarnation he was seen by posterity. This Hotei painting is perhaps based on an older Song version, a hypothesis supported at least by a recorded eulogy for a lost picture of this type entitled Budai zhi kong zhong fo, "Budai Pointing at the Buddha in the Void". The poem was composed by Xiyan Liaohui (1198-1262), a disciple of the Chan master Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) and 39th abbot of Tiantongsi on Mt. Taibai: The burlap sack, budai, is half collapsed and the cane stretched on the ground. With his hand he is pointing into the ground of the void, kong. If it is not the Buddha what is it? Duo, duo, duo!95 Budai was a favourite topic for punning and wordplay. In the first line Xiyan Liaohui plays with the trope of the name's literal meaning "burlap sack" and at the same time euphemistically alludes to the priest's pot-belly. Closely related to these ink paintings brushed in China are two Japanese renditions of "Hotei Pointing at the Buddha in the Void". One, now in the Tokyo National Museum, bears the seal of a little-known artist named Kbboku, probably active during the first half of the sixteenth century in Kamakura (Fig. 24),96 and the other, in the Cleveland Museum of Art, is a work by Yamada Doan (died ca.1573), with a four-line inscription by a certain Tbkei Dbjin: Big stomach, gaping garment, Treasures gathered deep in the bag's bottom, Passing through the sky is another road, Do not seek what his fingertip points out.97 Most likely this is to be taken as a warning not to seek after the way toward enlighten- ment consciously or frantically. But if we disregard the behest of the unidentified poet and try to fathom the invisible secret to which the unearthly Hotei points in all such paintings, with the unfettered laughter of the sagacious, we will find that, beside the layers of mean- 52 N Al a a 4; L ,ataa4 a aa' N a a ja aa ..araaAJja au :ar a aaaaarar'r --air' #.iaa aab a 4br!,a alt a. ra V 1isjaa L a I-- aal Naa a' a"'l'a'..

The Southern Song Emperor Gaozong (reigned 1127-1162), himself an accomplished calli- grapher and great admirer of Huang Tingjian, dedicated a poem to Budai which begins with the lines: In the blue sky, a small clouds High above in the sky, a solitary moon [He] manages to dwell outside this world, Secretly in a faraway place, Naturally seeking to hide in the market place, Strange is this hero.98 The always brimful sack of Hotei in which, it is said, rest his "treasures", can be seen as</page><page sequence="51">His finger points to the moon, but the finger itself is not the moon; If you wish to know his heart, ask the moon in the sky! In heaven there is Maitreya, on earth, Hotei - May I presume to ask everyone: are they the same or different?99 The highly innovative Zen artist Sesson Shukei (ca.1504-ca.1589) carried this subject a step further in his evocative calligraphy in the Goto Bijutsukan, Tokyo, with the name and title Hotei Oshd, "His Eminence Burlap Sack" (Fig. 25). The four large-scale characters written in semicursive mode, gybsho, in a single vertical line evoke in their peculiar place- ment and execution an abstract image of Hotei standing on his beggar's sack and point- ing at the moon, while the first character of the line with its circle-shaped lower part evokes the moon.100 The bold traces of Sesson's impetuous brush look like a playful cal- ligraphic pun on pictorial representations of the pot-bellied monk and clearly reveal the artist's ingenuity and preoccupation with the compositional possibilities in handling for- mal elements of Chinese characters. Thus he added another aesthetic dimension to the old Buddhist devotional custom of transcribing names and sacred formulae of deities and treating them as if they were painted icons. Such "names and titles in a single line" are called mybgb ichigybsho. The content of the phrase and the brushwork melt into an abstracted embodiment of the Zen saint Hotei whose name the characters indicate. These endeavours are obvious in another work by his hand, too, at the Yamato Bunkakan in Nara (Fig. 26). Tanteigetsu, "Moon at the Bottom of the Pool", was probably done in 1583 when the painter-monk was already eighty years old [seventy-nine in accordance with western counting] as he states in his signature.101 Nothing could exemplify better the total overthrow of traditional aesthetic standards and ideals in painting and calli- graphy at the hands of Zen artists than this work. Here, Sesson ignores all established rules and utterly reverses the proportion between painting and writing. Using a thick, bristly brush and saturated, dark ink he put to paper the three characters - each tilting in another direction - with rapid, forceful strokes and filled the upper two thirds of the scroll. Sesson displays in his writing an assured sense for rhythmic momentum and inter- related continuity. The overwhelming bold characters almost dwarf the abbreviated del- icate landscape below suggested only by a few rocks at the shore, a tiny boat, a faint, distant mountain range and - most essential for the understanding of this complex work - the reflection of the full moon on the water. Here the landscape serves merely as a shad- owy foil and pictorial exegesis for the written word. Allusions to and commentaries on the inherent purity of the full moon, its perfect round shape, and its brilliant light occur fre- quently in Zen writings. Seisetsu Shucho (1745-1820), for example, an influential Ja- panese Zen abbot, certainly considered the circle as the most fitting metaphor for the realm of absolute enlightenment when he quoted the first line from one of the poems of Hanshan, the "Master of Cold Mountain", to comment upon his ensb. 102 The quatrain of the eccentric Chinese Tang monk has been translated as follows: My mind is like the autumn moon Shining clean and clear in the green pool. No, that's not a good comparison. Tell me, how shall I explain?103 The religious idea and poetic content of Sesson's towering inscription is familiar. Quite original, however, is the compelling form of its visualization. The clear moon as emblem for the spiritual qualities and ultimate goal of every Zen monk appears to have been one of Sesson's favorite images. It probably reflects the artist's own vision of complete purity and of the gleaming realm of enlightenment. Therefore, it is not surprising to find the aged priest represented under a bright moonlit sky at the foot of snow-covered peaks in a self- portrait which also belongs to the Yamato Bunkakan (Fig. 27)^104 No less a luminary than the great Indian patriarch Nagarjuna (2nd or 3rd century), to whom Mahayana owes its doctrine of the "Middle Path" with its central concept of 54 99Addiss: op. cit., p. 68. 100 Sesson's Hotei Oshd calligraphy is the central scroll of a triptych. It is flanked by a pair of gibbon paintings from the brush of Senka, a contempo- rary of Sesson. On the left scroll, a monkey shown from behind looks up and reaches above him with his excessively long arm, as if he wanted to grab the moon. On the right scroll, a frontally shown monkey is perched high in a tree and bends down in a futile attempt to reach for the reflection of the moon, which is not shown in the painting. Even if the present grouping of this triptych was not the outcome of direct collaboration between the two artists, it at least seems to suggest, on the one hand, that the three scrolls were thought to con- vey a similar spiritual message and, on the other, that they may have been brought together at an early date. 101 Nakamura Tani'o: Sesson to Kantb suibokuga.

A poem attributed to him contains the following passage: The body, manifest in the round moon's apparition, Reveals the nature of all Buddhas. So mark my words: doctrine is nothing exterior, Is neither for the eye nor the ear. 105 The Tanteigetsu scroll may have originally been paired with a similar work entitled Setsugekka, "Snow, Moon, and Blossoms", which has survived only in a copy owned by the Tokyo National Museum.106 The arbitrarily turned and distorted characters from which a prunus branch and a few blossoms spring along the left side of the scroll grasp the significant aspects of the poetic idea and convey the spirit of nature - of the first ten- der plum blossoms, of the bright moon, and of clean white snow. The viewer of this pro- voking calligraphy is challenged to actively respond to the images and to complete the full meaning of them in his own aesthetic experience. What the Southern Song literatus Yan Yu (ca.1180-ca.1235) in his "Discourse on Poetry", the Canglang shihua, once pos- 55</page><page sequence="53">tulated as inherent qualities of superior poetry could just as well be applied to Sesson's synthesis of poetry, painting, and calligraphy: Like an echo in the void, and color in a form, The moon reflected in water, and an image in a mirror, The words come to an end, but the meaning is inexhaustible. 107 Considering the fundamental Zen experience of the unity of phenomena and the absolute, it is not difficult to understand the religious content of Zen art depicting seem- ingly secular subject matter. The eye of the Zen adept open to the "True Dharma" re- cognizes every creature and every object - inconspicuous and "profane" though it may be - as identical with the absolute, as manifestation of the Buddha Nature unique in itself and yet encompassing the whole universe. Since every object partakes of this ultimate truth, their representation does not need any special "symbolic" code as in orthodox Buddhist art. The painting of a landscape, a humble plant or fruit, a blooming plum branch, a monkey or an ox, a wild goose, a crane, or a sparrow reveals - beyond its per- ceptible subject and its aesthetic, artistic content - the "complete truth" of Zen,108 as condensed in the following short formula of the Hannya haramita shingyd, the "Heart Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom": "[...] form is emptiness and the very emptiness does not differ from form, nor does form differ from emptiness [...]".109 Like this experience, the art expressing the experience of Zen ultimately eludes any description and interpretation. A work of Zen art simply is - it does not mean! Beside such Zen art of the purest type, it is true that there are also other works which do allow interpretation - even if a convincing interpretation is not always easy. Thus it often hap- pens that we can decode, at least partially and probably never quite completely, the true iconographical connection between such Zen paintings and the supremely untrammeled world view of the artist only by means of his own written statement or by the commen- tary of a follower. The idea of the revelation of deepest religious insight in all phenomena of nature is con- veyed in the inscription on a portrait of Daido lchi'i (1292-1370), convincingly attributed to Kichizan Mincho (1351 -1431). The painting shows the 28th abbot of Tofukuji seated on a rock plateau under a pine, flanked by a deer and a goose (Fig. 28). Shokai Reiken (1315-1396), a successor of the portrayed abbot at the great Zen monastery in Kybto, wrote the following lines on the scroll in 1394: A platform of large and small rocks with a "Diamond Throne" Heaven and earth, composed alike of only one body The realms of causality and emotion transcended The enlightened deer and goose, unfaltering in their trust. Daidb, the Great Reverend Shingi. Requested by the Governor of Tanshu, Mybji [Mybchi?]-koji. 1394, early summer [fourth month?], last ten-day period. Taikd-zuda, age eighty. 110 The Zen master insists on that fundamental Buddhist tenet that the Buddha Nature is inherent in all things of the empirical world, down to the most lowly ones, the stones and the animals, and that they are not different from the same absolute and empty realm, even though not identical with it at all. When the Chinese Chan master Chushi Fanqi (1 297-1371) writes the line Shuiqingyujian - "When the water is clearing, the fish become visible" - on a heron painting by the Japanese painter-monk Moku'an Rei'en, active at the beginning of the fourteenth century in China, he means undoubtedly more than the banal fact.111 The bird, eagerly perched on a willow tree and - his prey before his eyes - ready to attack at any moment, most likely refers to the Zen adept whose spirit, cleansed from turbid secular thinking and feeling, sees the goal of enlightenment in immediate reach. The heron will spear the fish out of the blue like a streak of lightning; in the same way the purified Zen pupil will penetrate to the ultimate truth. Again and again, Zen monks, or painters close to Zen circles, of the Muromachi period have represented the heron, go'isagi, in this typical posture. 56 107 Bush: op. cit., pp. 44 and 191:72. 108 Cf.

A particularly attractive painting, and one of the oldest examples of this subject, trans- posed by Zen masters probably from older, colourful Chinese prototypes into mono- chrome ink painting more suitable to their taste is now in the Klaus F. Naumann Collec- tion, Tbkyb (No. 49).1 12 Close by each other, two evidently shivering herons each stand on one leg in the shallow water of a lotus pond, while above them a kingfisher is perched on a swaying reedgrass stalk. Even if the closed eyes and the lowered heads of the herons with their long, pointed beaks suggest tranquillity, their posture nevertheless seems to convey a certain interior tension and concentration. Using a technique called sotoguma, "exterior shading", the painter-monk Kinkei Rybbin, probably active toward the end of the fifteenth century, has the white plumage of the two gorgeous birds flash from the ground of even grey wash, maybe intimating an atmosphere of wintry dusk and at the same time reminding the viewer of the fundamental ideas of Buddhist purity. The lotus, too, suggested by spontaneous brushstrokes, may be interpreted in this way since it is considered of old not only as the cosmic symbol of the absolute, but also - beyond space and time - as emblem for the purity of the heart. The lotus flower blos- soms "in that innermost sphere of the self from which deepest enlightenment and liber- ation arise. The lotus flower thus becomes a symbol for the kernel of true essence which is identical with the Buddha Nature and remains as unpolluted from all sarnsara existence as the lotus' snow-white petals. The lotus grows out of murky waters bu t sheds all dust of the world without leaving any traces of this dust as it sheds drops of dew and water". 13 Th e pist Taiky Genj (cie c. 0atr17)myhv ae incito onasrl hoigawgai narc, nrmee an dietnei h etsneo the wod ntesm luintoelgtnet(i.2) _E_ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5</page><page sequence="55">The withered tree has no leaves on its branches; The wagtail pecks at the moss.

Taikyo-so. 114 The comparison between the wagtail looking for food in a scanty environment and the Zen monk in search of the truth, precious as jade but seemingly lying hidden, is clearly evident here. It may well be that Taikyo is not only the author of the inscription on this painting of the Burke Collection, New York, but that he also painted it, together with another, closely related scroll showing a wagtail and bamboo at the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven (Fig. 30).115 An ink painting in the Sansb Collection attributed to Kano Sanraku (1559-1635) shows two wagtails, one in flight and the other perched on a rocky promontory at the river shore. The four line poem by an unidentified calligrapher, maybe a Zen monk (by the name of Tanhan [?] Genhan), is placed boldly in the middle of the scroll with little reticence: What does the inquisitive wagtail see? The other one is in flight, and a light breeze stirs the sand. In search of its original state, It flew far south of the Ch'ing River. There are not many that have traveled Even as far as the Yellow River. (Tanhan [?]). 116 Here, too, we are undoubtedly dealing with metaphors alluding to the search for the true reality, to the striving after "insight into one's own essential nature" or, as the author of the poem says, after the "original state". These wagtail paintings are especially charac- terized by their sober directness and ascetic austerity. On the one hand, they may be considered as examples for the spiritualized concept of nature inherent in Zen, on the other hand as encouraging companions along the often long and troublesome path toward enlightenment, toward the "gateless barrier".

The spirit and the aesthetics of Zen have decisively influenced the architecture and gar- dens of the late Kamakura and Muromachi periods. The typical mode of construction used for medieval Zen monasteries was called zenshuy6, "style of the Zen school". Prominent Japanese masters of meditation often had been studying for years in China and paid great attention, beside their spiritual education, to general Chan regulations, special monastic codes, matters of infrastructure, facilities and paraphernalia with prac- tical and ritual functions, and to the architecture of continental Chan institutions. These masters, together with Chinese Zen pioneers invited to Japan, transmitted the basis for a specific Zen architecture in Japan. The monastic codes or "pure rules", as the term qing- gui (Jap. shingi) is translated literally, proved to be an abundant source of information for the transplanting of Song Dynasty Zen architecture, since they contained specific indica- tions concerning the use and equipment of monastic buildings. Thus, the "Rules and Rites to the Gate of Meditation", Chanmen guishi (Jap. Zenmon kishiki),117 stipulates, a.o.: Irrespective of their numbers or of their social status, those who have been permitted to enter the community to study should all reside in the Monks' Hall (seng-t'ang, [Jap. sodo]) arranged strictly according to the number of summers since their ordination. Meditation platforms should be built [along the sides of the hall] and a stand provided for each monk to hang up his robes and personal belongings. [...] The whole community should gather in the Dharma Hall [fatang, Jap. hattol, for the morning and evening discussions. [..] Not to construct a Buddha Hall [fodian, Jap. butsudenj but only build a Dharma Hall is to demonstrate a proper respect for the abbot as the mind-to-mind inheritor of the teach- ings of the Buddha and the Ch'an patriarchs. 118 : .

'. ; , -A 61</page><page sequence="58">It is precisely the stipulated omission of a hall with cult images that indicates the impor- tant role of the abbot in the monastic community and at the same time the great signifi- cance of the Dharma Hall or Lecture Hall in Zen architecture. The abbot himself repre- sented the Buddha and the patriarchs. He was the "Honored One", zun (Jap. son), a term basically reserved for the main Buddha image, benzun (Jap. honzon), worshiped in a monastery or a particular ritual. Evidently this was an attempt to avoid emphasis on the worship of cult images. Such implications can hardly have remained unknown to the planners of Japanese monasteries; in reality, however, they did not adhere to this injunc- tion. Myoan Eisai (1141-1215), the initiator of Rinzai Zen in Japan, is said to have parti- cipated actively in the construction of several buildings at Wanniansi on Tiantaishan and at Tiantongsi (Tiantongshan) on Taibaishan in today's Zhejiang Province during his stay in China from 1187 until 1191, in part most likely to gain experience in such matters. Enni Ben'en (1202-1280) sent his revered master Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) timber from Hakata in modern Fukuoka Prefecture to support the reconstruction of Wanshousi, a monastery partly burnt down in 1242, on Jingshan to the west of Hangzhou. In the accompanying letter, Enni reports that one year after his return from the Song Empire in 1242, he was appointed the founding abbot of Jbtenji in Hakata and that the Chinese architect Xie Guoming had erected the buildings. The original letter of thank you which the Jingshan abbot sent his disciple in return - probably one year later, in 1243 - is extant at the Tokyo National Museum.119 As a further sign of his gratitude, he wrote a series of large, poster-like characters, to be used by Enni Ben'en as stencils for the signboards and title tablets of his new monastery. He sent them to Japan with a letter conveying his apprehension that they might not be large enough, and offering to write more if that should be the case. In his letter, which has been preserved at the Hatakeyama Kinenkan, Tokyo, Wuzhun Shifan declared: I've written the big characters one by one. As your temple is large, I'm concerned that the characters will be too small. So I don't know whether you'll be able to use them or not. But if they are not useable, let me hear from you, and / will certainly write more for you. [,.]120 Such gakuji, large "frontal characters" carved into boards, were hung above gates, entrances of buildings, and above the fusuma dividing rooms inside, or they were used as notice and announcement tablets, haiji, for certain events inside the monastic build- ings. To this day, a signboard with the two striking characters hold, in Chinese fangzhang, "Abbot's Quarters", hangs slightly tilted forward under the projecting roof above the entrance to the prelate's residence at Tofukuji and Kenninji in Kyoto.121 The original writ- ten model for this signboard has come down to us at Tofukuji. It was brushed by the Song official Zhang Jizhi (1186-1266) whose powerful, energetic calligraphy style was much admired by Japanese Zen pilgrim monks. Zhang was in close contact with the Buddhist clergy and may have given this bold masterpiece, together with some other, similar writings, either to Wuzhun Shifan or he may have given it directly to the Chan prelate's Japanese disciple Enni Ben'en who was to become the founding abbot of Tofukuji. Thus, the cooperation between the great Chan centres in China and the newly-founded Japanese Zen monasteries was extremely close and fruitful from the beginning. Chinese construction specialists seem to have taken part in projects in Kamakura and Kyoto, and Japanese experts were sent to China to gather first-hand experience in structural and stylistic aspects of architecture.122 Sketches of monastery sites and layouts, ground- plans, cross sections and elevations of buildings, structural details of bracketing sys- tems, of columns and beam supports, altar platforms, all were carefully documented, while inventory and ritual furnishings were recorded in sketches and copious notes. Two such handscrolls, totaling a length of almost 12 meters, dating to the Southern Song Dynasty, and entitled Shina zensatsu zushiki, "Plans and Designs of Chinese Zen Monas- teries", demonstrate the circumspection and attention given to such projects (Figs. 32-34).123 A copy of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, the so-called Gozan jissatsu zu, illustrationss of the Five Mountains and Ten Monasteries", is extant at Daijbji in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture.124 This monastery had been transformed from a Shingon into a Zen institution by Tettsti Gikai (1 219-1309); thus, the acquisition of the original by the Dogen disciple or the attribution to him does not seem far-fetched since Gikal left for China in 62 119 Kokuhd - National Treasures of Japan.

There was great demand for such documentation in Japanese Zen monas- teries, and the term karayb, literally "Tang style", was generally applied to the construc- tion mode used in Zen monasteries built in Chinese style. The Japanese ability to appre- ciate and adapt to a foreign structural aesthetic led to a great number of magnificent Zen constructions; wherever necessary, the traditional Chinese model was modified accord- ing to the specific local conditions and requirements. Although pure Zen monasteries strike one as more austere than other Buddhist sanctuaries, they were not, and have never been, limited to their role as secluded places of monastically ascetic life: rather, they have always been influential public religious institutions as well, sometimes with large numbers of lay followers. The Kenchc5i sashizu may be taken as the prototype of the classic design for a metro- politan Zen monastery (Fig. 38). This "Plan to Scale of Kenchbji" founded in 1253 in Kamakura is based on Song models such as Tiantongshan near Mingzhou. It reveals the carefully thought out, purposeful plan for a strictly regulated monastic life. A river ran along the west side of the monastic precinct, garan;125 it flowed into a pond at the north east corner, where a wall at the eastern flank took over its protecting role. The alignment of the buildings along a south-north axis is clearly shown. From an outer gate, scmon, to the "Mountain of the Great Happiness", Kofukuzan, in the south, a path lined with pine trees led to the two-storey main gate, sanmon, literally translated "Triple Gate", although the compound is sometimes written with the character for "mountain", also pronounced san. On the one hand, the term refers to the three passages through the gate, which is usually five bays wide by two deep. On the other hand, it signifies the approach toward the nucleus of the monastic precinct, the "Holy Mountain", since all Zen institutions have in their official title, beside their actual name, a "mountain name" as well. The sanmon stands, like all the other important buildings, on a stone terrace with its broad side across the central axis facing south. It constitutes the mighty barrier between the profane and the sacred world. Visible from afar, it marks the borderline separating the secular realm steeped in sascra from the inner monastic ground offering space for enlightenment, nirvana. The "Triple Gate" symbolizes various aspects of Zen, among others its three sup- porting foundation pillars: the doctrine of Buddha and the patriarchs, monastic discipline, and meditation. Its three openings allude to the three ways of wisdom, i.e., hearing, think- ing, and practical action, as well as to the three gates of deliverance from illusion, delu- sion, and suffering in the three worlds, sangedatsu mon: the "Gate of Emptiness", kumon, i.e., the passageway to the realization of the immateriality of one's self; the "Gate with- out Characteristics", muscomon, i.e., admittance to the realization of the absence of all visible and tangible phenomena; and the "Gate without Desires", musamon, i.e., access to the realization of the futility of all human desires. These few intimations may suffice to indicate the position and significance of the sanmon in the basic architectural concept, and to demonstrate its far-reaching symbolic character in reference to a complex struc- ture of religious thought. 63</page><page sequence="60">~ .

Both were connected with the inner precinct of the monastery by corridors and offered monks as well as visitors the oppor- tunity to enter the holy boundary cleansed physically as well as spiritually. From the cen- tral "Triple Gate", a courtyard lined again with pine trees led to the great "Buddha Hall", butsuden, and, further north, at first to the two-storey "Dharma-Hall", hattd, and then to the abbot's residence, hojd. The Buddha Hall of a medieval Japanese Zen monastery corresponded to the "Golden Hall", kondd, of older orthodox Buddhist sanctuaries, where, as the name indicates, the golden or gilded cult images were worshiped. In Zen monasteries, too, this hall remained the spiritual center. It was here that the historical Buddha Sakyamuni was revered in cer- emonies and rites with prayers and sacrifices as the embodiment of the True Doctrine, the archetype and epitome of the monastic ideal. In the Dharma Hall, the personal encounter of the monks with the enlightened master of meditation, and thus with the "Holy Law" transmitted by him, took place. During the ple- nary meetings held several times every month, the abbot not only expounded the Word of the Buddha in sermons, but encouraged his disciples with paradigms and anecdotes drawn from the rich history of Zen, and discussed with them, in a discourse of question and answer, mondd, problems that had occurred during meditation, during the ponder- ing of paradox cases, kdan, or during daily routine work. The "Monks' Hall", sodd, also called "Meditation Hall", zendd, was the spiritual core of the complex. A decision to enter a Zen monastery did not mean an attempt to attain enlightenment in the solitary confinement of a secluded monastic cell, but a hope to reach salvation within the monastic community. In the sodd the monks, gathered from all over the country, lived together like densely "piled clouds"; hence the name undo, "Cloud Hall", as this building is sometimes called. The mostly spacious halls had a plain archi- tectural design. The floor was usually paved with square tiles of standard size, laid in a diamond pattern. Around the free central space and screened off toward the outside by a corridor, a slightly raised platform ran along the walls. On this platform, each monk was assigned his actual "living space" in accordance with strict hierarchical principles. It was just wide enough to sleep on it with outstretched body. The monks ate on the same plat- form, with their backs to the wall, facing the altar on which stood the statue of an enlight- ened "Holy Monk", shdsd, often Bodhisattva Mahjusri, as spiritual example. During medi- tation, they sat on thin cushions or straw mats. The abbot's seat, kyokuroku, was situated at the northern entrance to the inner space of the Meditation Hall, facing the "Holy Monk". The abbot's residence, hbjb, usually situated to the north or north-east of the Dharma Hall, was the ultimately responsible organizational control desk of the Zen monastery and as such served as educational and administrative center. At the same time, however, it was also the literary and artistic crystallization point of Zen culture proper. Here, the prelate would be available for confidential conversations with his disciples asking him for advice, and here he would receive lay adherents and secular dignitaries for official func- tions. Here, too, he would devote his leisure time to scientific and artistic pursuits, study religious, historical, and literary texts, write poems, brush Chinese characters, paint, and assemble congenial confreres and friends. Many of the shigajiku, "scrolls with poems and painting", were probably brushed during such gatherings at one of the hdjb of the gozan or at one of their "affiliates", the tatchO. During the Middle Ages, the abbot had at his dis- posal a niche-like desk recess, dashi fuzuku'e, and it was an obvious step to expand it gradually into a proper "'writing studio", shoin, in which a special alcove for hanging scrolls was provided. This so-called tokonoma was to become a characteristic of Japanese architecture. Beside the private rooms, the abbot's residence had reception and guest rooms, suitable for gatherings of literatii monks", bunjinsd, and the occasional tea cere- mony, chanoyu. For the tea ceremony, evolved from simple tea drinking to overcome fatigue during med- itative sitting into an aesthetic ritual with strict rules, a special room was developed in the course of time, the chashitsu. The Abbot's Quarters of Konchi'in at Nanzenji in Kyoto has 65</page><page sequence="62">'A V~ ~ ~ ~ A. an especially typical chasIs imbued with the spirit of Zen (Fig. 12)126 It is said that Kobori Enshii (1579-1647), an artist of many talents who exerted decisive influence on the aesthetic as well as philosophical aspects of the tea ceremony, designed the tea room of Konchi'in built around 1628. The chashis is called Hass6i seki4 "Eight-Window Room"; it measures only three and a half mats, sanlXhan dime. The guest enters through a narrow, low opening at floor's height, nijiri guchi, forcing him to crawl through, deeply bowed. The standard dimensions for such an entry closed by a small sliding door are 70 cm height and 65 cm width. Only those willing to be reduced to their own self, their bodily measurements, those ready to bow humbly and humiliate themselves, will be welcome in this purified, aesthetic sphere delivered from the dust of the world. Rustic, simple materials at first sight inconspicuous and hardly hewn at all, inspire introspective viewing in such a room and help to gain deeper insights into the essence of nature, of life, of simple things.

Precisely this contrast between rustic and refined allows true appreciation of the aesthetic focal point in its overall context and as individual object, such as the chagake, "tea hanging scroll", especially the particularly suitable shosaizu, "picture of a [scholar's] studio", entitled Kei'in shdchiku, "Hidden Cottage by a Mountain Brook", painted in 1413 and one of the great treasures of Konchi'in. This principle of com- plementary opposites has been kept alive to the present day in Japan. Remarkably, the holo of most metropolitan Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kybto were not built according to the architectural canon of the "Tang style", karayb, but in the style 67</page><page sequence="64">of the domestic nobility residences, i.e., in the so-called shinden zukuri. This elegant architectural style is characterized by the relaxing of a strictly symmetrical layout in favour of a freer arrangement of the rooms with more emphasis on the interaction of the build- ing with the garden, its ponds and waterfalls, affording views on the mountains and the firmament. In China, the term fangzhang for a scholar's hermitage or for the private res- idence of a Buddhist dignitary had been in use since the Tang Dynasty (618-906). Ancient sources trace the expression to the Chinese envoy Wang Xuance who is said to have vis- ited, on his expedition to India probably in 643, the ruins of a hermitage at Vaifali in which the sage Vimalakli-rti (Jap. Yuima) once had lived. Having attained enlightenment, this lay follower is said to have conversed with the Bodhisattva of the Highest Wisdom, Mahjunri (Jap. Monju), when he was sick, and to have taught an astonishing 32,000 disciples.127 Records tell us that Wang was highly surprised by the modest room; when he measured it, he found it to be but "ten square feet", fangzhang. Fangzhang is also the name used already by Sima Qian (ca.145-90 B.C.) in his histori- cal work Shiji for one of the three paradisiacal islands of the Daoist Immortals off the east coast of China: Penglai, "Dishevelled Goosefoot"; Yingzhou, "Ocean Continent", and Fangzhang, "Ten Square Feet". Originally, these may have been ordinary place names, "although all three contain one character each with super-natural connotations. [...] fang does not only mean 'square', but also 'magic"'.128 As early as 104 B.C. when the Han Emperor Wu (reigned 141 -87 B.C.) ordered the construction of a palace garden these "Isles of the Blessed" were reproduced in artificial lakes of various imperial parks. With the two other islands, fangzhang eventually came to express the idea of bliss. Adopting Chinese models and meanings the three islands are sometimes found in the so-called karesansui tei'en, "dry landscape gardens", of Japanese Abbot's Quarters as miniature representations. The garden facing the south front of the Tbfukuji hofo in Kybto, designed by Mirei Shigemori (1896-1975) in 1938, still contains four stone formations, seemingly placed at random, but rhythmically well calculated, on a raked gravel surface in which these old Daoistic ideas of paradise, embedded in the context of Zen Buddhism, live on to this day. From the "Eight Seas", hakkai, of the white sand rise the bold rock islands of the immortals: E,]O (Chin. Yingzhou), Horai (Chin. Penglal), Koryo (Chin. Huliang), and HFfo (Chin. Fangzhang). Alluding to the classic hierarchy of the five metropolitan Zen monasteries, five small moss hills in the south-west corner of the garden represent gozan, the "Five Mountains", creating, with their rich green and softly rounded contours, an attractive contrast to the bright sand surface and the angular rocks (Figs. 31, 39). The overall concept of the four gardens around the abbot's residence at Tbfukuji is to sym- bolize the eight main events in the life of S5kyamuni marking his way toward full attain- ment of the Buddha Nature, Shaka]jodc no hasso; thus, they are also called "Gardens of the Eight Aspects", hassc no tei. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I 68 i\ Fig. 39 Dry landscape garden, karesansui tei'en, on the south side of the Abbot's Quarters, hoj6, at To- fukuji, Kyoto, designed by Mirei Shigemori (1896-1975) in 1938 (Photo H.B.). 127 Herbert A.

Tokyo, 1967, pp. 67-71, and Ito Nobuo: Zenshb kenchiku. Nihon no bijutsu, No. 126. Tokyo, 1976, p. 24. According to the Kenchbji sashizu, a layout characterized by a clear sense of symmetri- cal order, the kuri or ku'in, "kitchen compound", on the east side of the inner courtyard, contained the housekeeping and administrative buildings; facing them on the west side was the spacious Monks' Hall, sod. In the plan, the latter is marked as daitetsudb, "Hall of Great Penetration", referring to the arduous intellectual labours the monks are under- going here in preparation for attaining enlightenment. Although Kenchbji and similar large Zen monasteries had other buildings as well, such as the Patriarchs' Hall, soshidb, a memorial hall for the founding abbot, kaisandb, a sutra library, kybzb, a reading room, shuryb, a bell tower, shorb, a storehouse, kura, or halls for the worshiping of various Bodhisattvas, the seven buildings mentioned above are the essential core of a Zen monastery. Among the first to adapt this grouping of seven main buildings, shichidb garan, found in slightly modified form already in the large Nara Buddhist monasteries of the eighth century, to Zen Buddhism in his "Corresponding Measuring Units", Sekiso oral, was the medieval court official, Buddhist monk and Shinto scholar Ichijb Kaneyoshi (also known as Kanera, 1402-1481). He stipulated the following order: Mountain Gate, san- mon, Buddha Hall, butsuden, Dharma or Lecture Hall, hattb, kitchen, kuri, Monks' or Meditation Hall, sodO, bathhouse, yokushitsu, and latrine, tbsu. 129 This concept was fur- ther developed into a virtual corpus of architecture by Mujaku Dochu (1653-1744), a Zen master interested in historical and linguistic aspects of Zen as well as in questions of practical monastic life. In his "Basket of Articles from the Zen Tradition", Zenrin shbkisen, he based the layout of the "Seven-Hall Plan" on an anthropomorphic grid, identifying the buildings with essential parts of the human body (Fig. 40): the sanmon with the genitals, the Buddha Hall with the heart, the Dharma Hall with the head, the Monks' Hall with the right arm, the kitchen, zuku (also chuku), with the left arm, the latrine, seflln, with the right * hattb - Dharma or Lecture Hall head *1t.

Also arranged in an opposing pair like the extremities of a living organism, the facilities necessary for physical cleansing behind the great entrance gate complete the "architectural body" of a Zen monastery. Although there are no medieval sources recording expresses verbs such anthropomorphic architectural concepts, the classic layout of a Zen monastery reveals at least a certain standardization, and this may well be taken as a hint that the architects of earlier periods were guided by ideas similar to those of Mujaku Dbchui in the eighteenth century. At any rate, his interpretation exerted far-reaching influence, since diagrams for monasteries based on a schematic human body can be found in many architectural sketch books and manuals handed down in families of Zen Buddhist carpenters, Zen daiku. 131 The model monastery layout of Kenchbji left its trace in Kyoto, too. There, the powerful regent (Fujiwara) Kujo Michi'ie (1192-1252) had started an ambitious construction pro- ject for a monastery in the south-west Higashiyama region in 1235. The monastery was to be equal to the great Buddhist centers in the old Imperial capital of Nara in times past,132 an aspiration clearly evident in the choice of the name for the new Zen institu- tion, Tofukuji, "Monastery of Eastern Bliss", borrowing one character each of the names of Tbdaiji and Kofukuji. The official name Enichisan, "Mountain of the Wisdom Sun", alludes to the comparison of the luminous wisdom of Buddha with the sun: it is shining so brightly that it expels the darkness of delusion. In 1243, Kujo Michi'ie found an ideal consultant for spiritual as well as practical matters of his new monastery project, the completion of which he did not live to see: Enni Ben'en (1202-1280), trained on Jingshan and returned from China only a few years earlier, had tried to spread Zen Buddhism from Hakata in northern Kyuishu, but had met with resistance from local followers of the ortho- dox Tendai school. Enni moved to the Fumon'in, a small cloister founded in the northern part of the precinct in 1246. Under his supervision, the overall layout of Tbfukuji began to take shape. The basic elements of Song Dynasty Chan architecture, well-known to Enni from his sojourn in China, were applied; certain details were adapted to practical conditions and the newest tendencies of Buddhist sacred structures were included. When the gigantic two-storey Buddha Hall was completed in 1255, Enni Ben'en was offi- cially appointed founding abbot of Tbfukuji. The construction of the complete complex took more than two decades, and the Dharma Hall, hattb, could not be consecrated until 1273. Tofukuji quickly developed into one of the most important gozan monasteries in Kybto and came to be among the most influential Rinzai institutions in all of Japan. It has thus been chosen here to be treated in some detail, representing all the other mag- nificent Zen monasteries in Japan, since it demonstrates, in its overall layout as well as in certain specific buildings, the salient characteristics of Zen architecture, and since all aspects of Zen culture came to an unprecedented culmination within its walls under the guidance of eminent abbots. This is borne out not only by the virtually incalculable trea- sure of literary works and historical documents at Tofukuji, but also by the wealth of invaluable masterpieces of Chinese and Japanese painting and calligraphy still in the possession of the monastery. From the very beginning of its history, Tbfukuji was a cen- ter of art and art collecting. Barely a century after the solemn consecration of the Dharma Hall in 1319, a devastating fire razed large parts of Tofukuji to the ground. The friendly monks at Kenchbji in Kamakura put the layout of their own monastery, the Kenchoji sashizu, at the disposal of their confratres in the capital, to be copied by the carpenters in charge of the monastery's reconstruction. On the basis of this classic plan, TOfukuji was reconstructed in modified form in accordance with a purely Zen Buddhist concept (Fig. 41). This explains the close relationship between the two great monasteries. When Kenchbji, too, was ravaged by a fire at the beginning of the fifteenth century, the original of the Kenchbfi sashizu was lost in the flames. In 1723, a copy was made of the layout plan copied for Tbfukuji four hun- dred years earlier, and in this form the document, so important for the history of Japanese Zen architecture, has come down to us. 70 130 Chapter 2, Zenrin shbkisen, ed.

In it, the personalities connected with the history of the monastery, the buildings of the complex, their main sculptures, cloisters on the precinct, as well as neighbouring Buddhist institutions are mentioned. The painting shows the monastery from the west with the "east hills", Higashiyama, in the background, revealing clearly the axial south-north alignment of the central monastic buildings. On the right hand side of the painting at the southern end of the precinct, the main entrance gate to the monastery, the scmon, is slightly recessed in the surrounding wall and opening toward the west due to the geographical situation. Crossing a courtyard, the visitor reaches the Triple Gate, flanked in the west by the latrine and in the east by the bath- house. In the centre of the painting, the Buddha Hall and the Dharma Hall, aligned along the south-north axis, tower over the Monks' Hall in front of them, while the administra- tive and the housekeeping buildings, kuri, in the east are almost completely hidden by the two imposing main halls. A roofed bridge on high pillars shown in the left third of the painting, the tsutenkyc, erected by Shun'oku Mybha (1311 -1388) across a gorge in 1380, connected the abbot's residence, hdjd, with the Founder's Hall, kaisandc, the Fumon'in, and other cloisters and buildings at the northern edge of the monastery (Fig. 44). The extant, 22 m high two-storey sanmon of Tbfukuji is one of the most important mon- uments of medieval Zen architecture (Fig. 45). Spanning a width of five bays adding up to 25.5 m, it measures two bays of 10.2 m in depth. Eighteen sturdy wooden pillars, hashira, resting on round, flat stone plinths, soban, carry the projecting lean-to roofs and the upper storey with its enormous irimoya roof, a combination of hip roof and gabled roof (Fig. 35). The tiles, kawara, are laid in the "monk-nun" system typical for Buddhist buildings. From small, so-called sanrb structures projecting out of the flanks of the gate, stairs lead into the upper storey, jdsd, containing a worship hall sumptuously adorned with paintings and sculptures (Figs. 55-56). The complex bracketing system, tokyo, in the architrave zones allows the far projecting of the heavy tiled roofs.

The Monks' or Meditation Hall was erected in 1347 (Fig. 48).134 As in a number of other Zen monasteries, it is also called senbutsufti "Place for the Selection of Buddhas" [i.e., the mok haigatie nihemn] ietepanbthueadteltie ti 7415 Fig. 45 Triple Gate, sanmon, of Tdfukuji, Kydto, sec- ond half 14th century (Photo H.B.). 133 The also used term tenjikuy5, "Indian Style", is misleading since it has been proven that Shunjob6 Chogen (1121 -1206) as well as Chinese architec- tural experts brought this style to Japan from China. Possibly, the term refers to Tianzhushan (Jap. Tenjikuzan) southwest of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, a Chan monastery that may have been visited by Japanese expeditions. Cf. Soper: op. cit.

Structural con- cept as well as practical purpose are evident in a sober, but elegant way. The effect inside the building is one of restraint, even asceticism. The abbot's residence, however, reconstructed nine years after the fire of 1881, elicits quite a different feeling. The attractive views on to the surrounding gardens and the close connection of the architecture with nature invite quiet introspection. This atmosphere of serene tranquillity is due to the flowing transition from inside to outside made possible by grid doors, shitomido, or paper-covered sliding doors, fusuma shOji, opening to the full height and width of the room and thus allowing nature as it were to breathe inside the house. The attitude of Zen toward nature and landscape plays an important part in the layout of a monastery as well as in the design of the various buildings in it.

On the other hand, magnificent miniature landscapes were created artificially with natural elements such as stones, sand, moss, bamboo, bushes, trees, and ponds. The individual parts of such landscapes had symbolic meanings, and their view animated the Zen adept to meditative immersion in the cosmic space of the universe and into the essence of this world. The natural surroundings of such artificial landscapes, especially prominent mountains, were often included into the view as a background, a "borrowed view", shakkei. It seems reasonable to suppose that ink landscapes inspired the garden designers to such devices. The close connection between abbreviating, monochrome ink painting and a number of Zen gardens with decidedly abstract features has often been pointed out, and the assumption that some masters of the brush were also active as gar- den designers is not far-fetched.137 Some of the artistically talented abbots, too, no doubt took part themselves in the design of their monasteries' gardens. When Muso Soseki (1275-1351) was appointed the abbot of the then neglected Saihoji, a Jodo monastery in the southern part of the summer palace in Kybto, he not only transformed this center of Amida belief into a respected Zen institution, but, in the course of renovating the buildings, he also set about restoring the garden area as well. Because the ground is covered with moss, Saihbji is popularly called Kokedera, "Moss Monastery".138 Muso's design for this garden is quite different from the one he created for Tenryuji, to be enjoyed from the open rooms or the veranda of the abbot's residence; the garden at Saihoji is intended for strolling around, kalyushiki tei'en, and enjoying the constantly changing attractive views. The "Golden Yellow Pond", ogon'ike, imitating the shape of the character shin, "heart", and thus also called shinji'ike, seems to be a vestige of the previous garden since a pond is an integral part of monas- teries consecrated to Buddha Amida. Believers in Amida hope for salvation in his "Pure Land", ]ddo, and to be reborn as innocent small children out of lotus flowers in a pond of his Western Paradise. However, for Muso Soseki, a Zen master of great religious ardour, the design of a monastery garden was not only an artistic endeavour; more important to him was to com- municate essential ideas of his Zen attitude by means of an animate image of nature and to make apparent the presence of the Buddha Nature in all Being. "The garden [of Saihbji] is a symbolic representation of the ideal land of Zen in accordance with a description in the Hekiganroku139 [in the famous Chinese kdan compilation Biyanlu dating to the early twelfth century]", Heinrich Dumoulin writes, and he continues: "Among the skillful stone groupings tower the massive boulders in the center of the garden. The northern, some- what elevated part of the garden with its hard, angular stones is in sharp contrast with 77</page><page sequence="74">the blooming trees and the soft moss paths surrounding the Golden Pond on its lower plane. To the Zen monk, the garden shows two opposite aspects of reality, to be expe- rienced in the comforts of a harmonious life or in the rough, ascetic climate of exercise. The soundless stone garden symbolizes the enduring power of strenuous exercise. A stone of roundish shape (zazen seki) invites one to seated meditation. Here, the monk finds his spiritual homeland in the midst of nature."140 Already as a young monk during his wandering years, Muso Soseki returned again and again to the seclusion of nature, and he attained enlightenment on a hot May evening of 1305 when he took a rest from exacting meditation sitting in the cooling shade of a tree in front of his hermitage at Usuba (Ibaraki Prefecture). It is hardly by accident that he writes of this fundamental experience in a poem using the metaphor of a gardener: For years, I dug in the earth, searched for the blue sky; But I only grew heavier, everything stood still and hampered itself; But then I got up one night, in the dark, [taking] stones and tiles, And with casual hand I smashed the bones of heaven.141 As an expression of his discontent with the Tendai doctrine, Muso changed his original monk's name Chiyo to the Zen Buddhist Dharma name Soseki which can be translated as "Distant Stone".142 He chose these two characters after a dream vision of the Chinese Chan mountains Shushan (Jap. Sozan) and Shitoushan (Jap. Sekitbzan) in Jiangsu Pro- vince. MusO Soseki may have expressed his intimate relations with mountains and waters, as well as his religious thoughts associated with landscapes and gardens, most clearly and concisely in the 57th chapter of his "Questions and Answers in a Dream", MuchO mondd: Of old, there are many among us who create landscapes [in their gardens] by erecting small hills, placing stones, planting trees, and having a little stream flow through it. Even if the inclination for this may be the same with everybody, people's taste is always dif- ferent. Now there are people who in their hearts do not really like such things, but they adorn their abode because they want others to admire it. And there are people who are attached greedily to a thousand things and thus collect and love rare treasures; for such people, this includes a beautiful landscape, and thus they search for rare stones and unusual trees. Such people do not love the charm of a beautiful landscape, but the "com- mon dust" [zokujin] of the world. Po ChO-i [Bai Juyi, 772-846]143 planted bamboo around a little pond he had dredged and loved it above all. The bamboo is my best friend because its heart is empty; because the water is of pure nature, it is my master. Since people who love beautiful landscapes have a heart like Po Cho-i, they do not mix with the "common dust". There are those amongst them who are of pure and plain nature and do not love the "common dust"; they only recite poems, play the flute near sources and stones, and thus nourish their hearts. Speaking about the lingering sickness of foggy haze and about the innermost entrails of the source stones, we are using words of exactly such people. One must call them the lovable ones of this earth. But if they are without the urge for truth, this will be the reason for their constant rebirth. But there are also people for whom the sight of a mountain or of water removes their sleepiness, consoles them in their loneliness, and supports them on their way toward the truth. In this, they are most different from other people in their love for landscape. One cannot but call this venerable indeed, but since they still see a difference between the landscape and their path toward truth, they cannot be called real seekers of truth. Those, however, who per- ceive mountains, rivers, the great earth, grasses, trees, and stones as their own nature seem to be dependent on secular feelings when they love a landscape; but in their case, this love is a genuine search for the truth, and the appearances which turn into the four elements [shiki, literally "the four vital life forces"] they take as kufu [striving for enlight- enment, satori]. If they do this correctly, they demonstrate that genuine seekers of truth love landscape. Love for mountain and water can therefore not be called bad per se, but neither can they be called good without qualifications. Mountains and water partake nei- ther of good or bad, good or bad lie in the hearts of people. 144 The highly sensitive Muso Soseki was a son of the house of Genji (Minamoto). He was born in Ise Province in 1275 as a distant descendant of the Emperor Uda. This is reported by his disciple and nephew Shun'oku Myoha (1311 -1388) in the biography of his master. 78 140 Dumoulin: op. cit.

According to Chan Buddhism of that time, language and poetry were inevitably embroiled with delusion of the illusionary world and could only be overcome by "thundering silence", i e., speechlessness. 144 Benl: op. cit.

Dissatisfied with the study of the siltras and dogma as practiced in the Tendai and Shingon schools, he set out to search for a master of meditation. He studied zealously under important masters in the great Zen monasteries in Kybto and Kamakura until he attained enlight- enment in 1305. One of his earlier mentors, Kbhb Kennichi (1241 -1316), son of the Emperor Go Saga, thereupon appointed him as his official successor. MusO's fame spread quickly across all of Japan, and admirers trying to become his disciples were legion. He tried to escape his numerous disciples by settling in secluded mountain areas. But in the end, he could not but accede to the~~~~~~~~~~:|: reetls plain of his folwro1h reetee ftecut ortr otecneso e nKmkr n yt.I 135 meo oDioapitdhmtenit bo fNnejt hc ewst reuni h aecpct rm13 ni 13.I 39 ewsnmntdtefud in peaeoTeril.ji a moatr htdvlpd ne Isdrcinnoolyntth reiiu centr of , th caitl bu at th same tim int on of th otcetv oa &lt;XXX'\,&gt;SS\XSWX S1 W~~~~~~~~~~~~~7</page><page sequence="76">points of the arts and literature, while becoming an important institution of foreign trade as well. Muso Soseki died on the 30th day of the 9th month in 1351 at the age of 76 years. No fewer than seven Emperors bestowed the title of "National Master" on him, three of them while he was still alive. The most famous among these titles is the one con- ferred on him by the Emperor Go Daigo, Musb Kokushi, "National Master of the Dream Window". One of the most intense ways to experience the world in its fullness and emptiness may well be the meditative immersion into the garden of a Zen monastery, especially into a "dry landscape garden", karesansui tei'en. This type flourished particularly toward the end of the Muromachi period and still holds a dominant position in the art of garden design in Japan today. The power emanating from it lies in the firm structure inherent in the placement of the rocks and stones, seemingly placed at random, but projecting, in harmony with sand, gravel, and moss, the complete universe in concentrated intensity - and thus not wholly different from a landscape painting - into an enclosed field. The white sand often symbolizes the flowing element, waterfalls, rivers, creeks, even the sea in its infinite expanse, while weathered stones and angular, almost proudly towering rocks, either isolated or in groups, suggest islands, shores, and bridges. Frequently, rocks rep- resenting islands introduce Daoist connotations of paradisiac bliss and longing for sal- vation to the basic statements of such Zen gardens. The most uncompromising realization of a "plane dry landscape", hiraniwa karesansui, is no doubt the garden - world-famous today - facing the abbot's residence, hboj, at Rybanji in north-western Kybto (Figs. 52-53).145 It is characterized by optimal reduction and abstraction. The young feudal lord Hosokawa Masamoto (1466-1507) is said to have reconstructed Rybanji in 1488 and to have added the garden. Fifteen stones of various shapes and sizes are placed on natural moss beds in seemingly haphazard groupings in a wide, rectangular enclosure of raked white sand, hakusa. But the arrangement of the stones in groups of five, two, three, two, and again three is in fact highly sophisticated, showing only fourteen stones from any angle. In its rhythmic accentuation and its asym- metric tension, the Rybanji garden resembles an ink painting converted into a three- dimensional composition and reduced to its essential elements. It is a signal-like para- dox for the all-encompassing universe and for the nature-like phenomenal reality of the goal of Zen enlightenment, a cipher for the absolute emptiness of Being.

While there were successful and highly productive painting ateliers under the direction of competent painter-monks in a number of the great metropolitan Zen monasteries, no such workshops existed for sculpture. Thus, Zen monasteries employed the services of experienced sculptors active for other monasteries and customers, since orthodox medieval Buddhist schools had always ranked sculpted images much higher than Zen had. The busshi, "Buddha [statue] masters", were organized into guilds and worked in so-called zbbussho, "workshops for the making of Buddha [statues]" or bussho, "Buddha [sculpture] ateliers"; originally, they were connected with religious or national institutions, but during the Middle Ages they had developed into largely independent enterprises, establishing their workshops only temporarily at a monastery for the com- pletion of a specific commission.146 One of the most important sculpture ateliers was the shichijf bussho, named after its location on "Seventh Street" in Kyoto, out of which came important branch ateliers. Since the eleventh century, busshi sometimes were included - at least nominally - into the Buddhist clergy by being given ecclesiastical titles. They used the honorary title hokkyb, "Dharma Bridge", hbgen, "Dharma Eye", or ho'in, "Dharma Seal", often in signatures hidden along with the date of production inside their sculptures. Even if the written word and paintings ultimately meant more to the masters of medita- tion than revered statues of traditional figures from the Buddhist pantheon, it must not be forgotten that such statues are to be found in various Zen monastery buildings to this day. In the fifth chapter Reizbmon of his Zenrin shbkisen, completed in 1741, Mujaku Dbchut (1653-1744) includes an extensive list of so-called reizb, "Images of Saviour Figures", complete with iconographical explanations.147 It begins with "aSkyamuni Turn- ing the Flower", Nenge Shaka, and "Sakyamuni with the Treasure Crown", Hbkan Shaka, and includes the most important Bodhisattvas, such as Kannon, Monju, and Fugen, the Buddha disciples Mahakayapa and Ananda, the Sixteen Arhats, Juroku Rakan, a variety of guardian deities, such as Bonten (Brahma) and Taishakuten (Indra), the "Four Kings of Heaven", Shitennb, the "Eight Great Heavenly Generals", Hachidai Shinshb, the "Sixteen Good Deities", Juroku Zenjin, the Dragon God Shoho Shichiro, the "Protective Spirit of the Monastery Precinct", Garanjin, the "Protective Spirit of the Place", Dojijin, the "enlight- enment seekers" Zenzai Doji (Sudhana) and Getsugai Choja (Somachattra), as well as Zen patriarchs, e.g., Bodhidharma, Baizhang Huaihai (Jap. Hyakujo Ekai, 749-814) and Linji Yixuan (Jap. Rinzai Gigen, died 867), and finally images of eminent masters of medi- tation, chinzb. Although other important Buddha and saviour images also worshiped in Zen monasteries, such as Dainichi Nyorai, Amida, Yakushi, the Bodhisattvas Miroku and Jizo, or the "Bright Kings" of Esoteric Wisdom Fudo and Aizen, are not included in the list of the learned Zen master, Mujaku Dochu- seems to have considered five categories of cult images: 83</page><page sequence="79">1. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 2. Buddha disciples, enlightenment seekers, and successors 3. Guardian deities of the doctrine, of the community, and of individuals 4. Guardians of the monastery and local deities 5. Patriarchs and abbots In the butsuden, a Buddha or Bodhisattva statue usually acts as main cult image, hon- zon. Naturally, priority is given here to the founder of the religion, the historical Buddha Sakyamuni. They are placed on an elevated platform on a pedestal, the so-called shu- midan, the "Sumeru terrace". The step-like graduated platform represents Mt. Sumeru, the holy mountain symbolizing the world axis and carrying tiered heavenly spheres on its top according to the cosmological ideas of ancient India. In many Monks' Halls, sbdb, or Meditation Halls, zendb, an image of Monju Bosatsu acted as spiritual model and mani- festation of the enlightened "Holy Monk", shcsc, visually helping to support the exercises of the monks. In the upper storey of the Triple Gate, sanmon, groupings of Rakan can be found, accompanying a central image of Shaka with Zenzai Doji and Getsugai Choja, in most cases sumptuously painted and gilded like the room itself (Figs. 55-56).

Aid~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i -a:~~~~: '4 , Zen monasteries, the Buddha Hall was flanked by a dojidb where the guardian deities were enshrined, and a soshidb for the images of the patriarchs and spiritual ancestors. In later times, however, such statues were placed inside the butsuden on special plat- forms, dojidan or soshidan in the back part of the hall.148 Of the iconographical categories mentioned above, we are interested above all in the por- trait statues of outstanding masters of meditation for our purpose, since the portrait has pivotal importance in Zen. Called dingxiang in Chinese, it is read chinzb or chinsb in a special Japanese pronunciation. When pronounced chbsb, the same two characters refer to the "protuberance of wisdom", usnisa, the topknot on the head of Buddha. The usntia is one of the thirty-two natural and super-natural physical characteristics of the Tathagata symbolizing the absolute knowledge and perfect wisdom of the Enlightened One. The super-natural characteristics are said to be invisible to ordinary people, which explains the expression wujian dingxiang or mugen chbsb in Japanese, "invisible protu- berance of wisdom". Although originally the term clearly meant usngia, it came probably to be used for Zen Buddhist portraits - occasionally also for images of Tiantai (Jap. Tendai) and LO (Jap. Ritsu) masters - due to obvious analogies and the function of such likenesses. Mujaku Dochu attempts to explain the semantic ambiguity of this rhetorical concept to the effect that: The characteristics of the patriarchs are originally formless, muso. It is like the Nyorai [Tathagata], whose usnisa, chosb, cannot be seen. Therefore [portraits of patriarchs] are called "topknots" chinzo. The Daihokyo darani kyo [Dharanl Scripture of the Torch of the Great Dharma] states: "The usn-ia, chbsb, of the Nyorai is the [corporeal protuberance, nikkei, perfect and complete. It can be seen neither by heavenly nor by human beings."149 Since Zen is seeking after a "special transmission outside the teachings", kybge betsu- den; and postulates "no dependence upon words and letters", furyu monji, "directly pointing at the mind of man", jikishi ninshin; "seeing into his own nature, man attains Buddhahood", kenshbjobutsu, the portrait of a Zen master documents and calls to mind the process engendered between him, the Enlightened One, and his disciples in search of the "gateless barrier", grappling with the breakthrough to enlightenment, when the quiet "transmission from mind to mind", ishin denshin, happened. Of course, this phe- nomenon is invisible and transcends by far common sensory capacity and ordinary ways of knowing and experiencing. Just as the omnipresent wisdom power of the Enlightened One or Tathagata manifests itself symbolically in the "protuberance of wisdom", incon- ceivable in its numinous existence to common perception, the transmission of the Dharma mind is invisible, devoid of delimiting features, since the ultimate truth is "form- less", musb, empty, and yet full of salvific effect and potential. 85</page><page sequence="81">1 I II_ i ._ d -&gt; h t For the portrait statues of founding abbots, a separate hail, the kaisandcd, "Hall of the Mountain Opener", was erected in Zen monasteries (Fig. 57). Portraits of other important prelates were sometimes placed in the tatchO- or "cloister", to which the depicted digni- tary retired after his official term and which often had been founded by him. Here, many of them found their last place of rest. As a rule, chinzcd were sculpted shortly after the death of the master and were then intended to remind succeeding generations of monks of the personality of the deceased and to keep his special transmission of the doctrine alive. But there are also portraits that were commissioned by disciples and followers while the subject was still alive, at the occasion of an anniversary, such as a special birthday, or at the honourable appointment as abbot of a metropolitan gozan monastery. The first recorded case of a Ohan Buddhist portrait done during the model's lifetime was the clay statue of the sixth patriarch Huineng (638-713). An artist named Fangbian from Shu, present day Sichuan, seems to have encountered the aged master of meditation by chance. It probably was during the second half of 712, one year before Huineng's death, when he was seventy-five years old. Fangbian offered to make his likeness much to the amusement of the portrayed patriarch. The erudite Buddhist encyclopedist Daoyuan recorded in his famous hagiological work Jingde chuandeng lu (Jap. Keitoku dent~roku), "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007]", completed in 1004, the incidental meeting between the artist and his model: There was a monk from Sichuan, Fangbian by name, who came to visit the master. "I am good at modeling clay figures'; he said. Keeping a straight face, the master replied: "Try -[I r 1I ! making one then. " Fangbian did not understand the master's intent and made a clay fig- ure of the master, about seven inches high, on which he expended all his ingenuity. Examining it, the master said: "Your modeling nature is good, but your Buddha Nature does not come out so well. But I'll give you some clothing in payment." The monk bowed in thanks and left. 150 Except for a few early clay images there is no indication that chan portrait statuary deanjod great relignio oer artistic recgnition in Cehina Impoertant was not realisticn life-siz or teve meronumnalyo rheprecesentatin, esetia wasp thes rpeal lifelmikprseinc of the deadin masie.Btterhmelf hiaresence prains thet flesh asommmifsioed icn.I mdcipevald timloers thie rp rhefisetationald canon of Japanes Zenhis portrait sttesflowed larigel the onv'sliention for Shpainted imageyNs 19-22).

Most Zen por- trait sculptures are made of Japanese cypress wood, hinoki; although they are hollow inside, they were not intended to be carried around during ceremonies such as proces- sions, but they were, as suggested above, installed in a fixed place; nor were they wor- shiped by individual disciples as "competence seal" confirming attained enlightenment. They were at the disposal of the complete monastic community as devotional and memo- rial images. For the carving of portraits, the sculptors used the well-tried method of join- ing several hollowed wood blocks, yosegi zukuri. In order to hide the joints, minor un- evenness, and tears in the wood liable to occur in the course of time, a thin gauze textile made of hemp, asanuno, was glued on the statue and smoothed with a lacquer founda- tion, urushisabi, in preparation of the pigmentation. No doubt, the sculptor's main con- cern was the face, which was carved into a separate, flat block like a mask. But the hands and the folds of the garments were also given due attention. Some artists may have known their subject while still alive, and thus based their work on "immediate observa- tion", taikan shashb. Others had to fulfill their commission using painted images, sketches, and possibly reports of eye witnesses, as was the case for the two Japanese sculptors Injun and Inko when they sculpted the portrait of the Chinese Chan master Zhongfeng Mingben (Jap. Chuho Mybhon, 1263-1323) (No. 21). Artist and model never encountered each other in this case. Yet almost all chinzd, the ones made postum included, are strikingly realistic depictions of their subjects. What ultimately decides the specific character of a portrait is the degree to which the artist has been able to instill the individuality of the represented person into his work; in the case of a masterpiece, the person depicted is conjured up in his or her full immedi- acy and intensity. Despite all efforts to achieve mimetic resemblance, keiji, however, a portrait is bound to remain the subjective interpretation of an individual by the artist. It can never be the objective representation of a human being, however great the resem- blance achieved may be. A portrait can therefore be defined as the substitute realization of an individual by representative-interpretative depiction of the visual appearance of a certain person. In order to heighten the effect of life-like presence, the medieval Japanese sculptors devised the technique of inserting concave, polished pieces of crystal behind the eye slits (Figs. 58-61). For these "inlaid jewel eyes", gyokugan kannyG, the pupils were painted on tiny pieces of paper or silk, glued or laid on the back of the "contact lenses", and pressed to the small crystal plates by means of a small wooden plate fastened with wooden nails or bamboo pegs. In the case of the portrait sculpture of Ikkyu Sojun (1394-1581) at Shuion'an near Kybto, probably carved immediately after his death, the actual hair of the deceased (?), ihatsu,151 inserted into small, drilled holes around his mouth, at the eye- brows, and on top of the head further contributed to the strikingly realistic character of the sculpture (Fig. 59). The Ikkyu statue at Shinju'an of Daitokuji, too, is characterized by the remains of a dark beard and a "wig" made of black animal hair (Fig. 61 ).152 Obviously, the demand for mimetic representation of the visible appearance was taken to its extreme in this case. The re-animation of the represented master could be intensified effectively in another way, too, by incorporating into the sculpture the ashes of his body, remains of his hair or finger-nails, writings by his hand, or ritual utensils and personal belongings of the mas- ter. Such relics or saintly remains physically substantiated the spiritual presence of the master and intensified it to the level of "real presence", thus removing it from any tem- poral-spatial distance. At the same time, the statue thus magically "animated" took on the function of reliquary. 87</page><page sequence="83">The veneration of relics, ?arfra (Chin. sheli, Jap. shar,), had a long tradition and was widely spread in Buddhism.153 In its original orthodox meaning sarnra refers to the pure crystal- lized grains found after Sakyamuni's cremation, to his ashes and other corporeal remains, such as teeth, hair, finger-bones and -nails, or to the ashes, bones, and similar physical fragments of saints. In our context it shall be used in the wider sense of reliquiae, i.e., "remains", including so-called "contact relics" or "secondary relics", sacred objects and religious paraphernalia that are said to have once been used or belonged to revered ecclesiastics. The fervent cult of relics and their tremendous increase was partly due to their mystic power, to gaining new ?arfra after cremation of saints, to fragmentation, and further distribution within the Buddhist church throughout Asia. The relic of ultimate sub- stance and excellence, however, was the saintly body itself unaltered in its physical and spiritual presence and radiance. In China and Japan as in the ancient Western world non- putrefaction or "terminal incorruptibility"154 was taken as evidence of exceptional sanc- tity. Fantastic accounts frequently encountered in biographies of eminent Buddhist eccle- siastics were obviously introduced to corroborate the conception of a holy man's "liberation from the corpse", shijie, to use a pertinent Daoist term. They emphasize the non-duality of body and soul, of physical body, roushen (Jap. nikushin), literally "flesh body" or "meat body", and spiritual body or "true mind", zhenxin (Jap. shinshin), also called benxin (Jap. honshin), "original mind", meaning the all-embracing Buddha Nature, through transcendental extinction beyond the empirical limitations of life and death. Thus the "flesh body" of a saint is thought to be identical with his "true body", zhenshen (Jap. shinshin), of ultimate reality, i.e., his "Dharma body", fashen (Jap. hosshin), and this, of course, is indestructible. The brilliant elitist Mahayana thinker Huiyuan (334-416), who is known for his strong "Pure Land" faith and his persistent desire to see visions of the Buddha Amitabha and to be reborn in his paradise after death, participated in the dis- course on body and soul with followers of the rival religion, Daoism, and contributed some fundamental ideas to the immortality of the soul or spiritual body. By expressing himself largely in a literary language full of allusions to the ancient classics he wrote among other things: A fool, when he sees a body dissolving at the end of his life, believes that the will (to live) of the soul also perishes, as, when he sees the fire ending with the wood, he thinks that it died together with the burnt up wood. Thus say those who strive for longevity [yang- shen or "alchemists"], but not those who want more (that is the Buddhists). [...] Though body and soul are different, they change together; though what is within and what is with- out are two things, they are of one common substance. Who else but the truly wise know where the boundary line runs. Others get more and more confused (the longer they con- sider the problem). 155 Huiyuan, who carried on an extensive correspondence with Kumarajiva (344-413), the translator of Buddhist texts and influential Indian missionary in China, successfully trans- ferred Indian Mahayanism into terms easily understood by cultivated Chinese. Traditional Indian Buddhism basically denied the immutable survival of the individual soul after death. The status of the Buddha was so exalted and the attainment of Buddhahood such an inconceivable process of past and future that only very few select individuals might eventually reach this goal after incalculably long aeons of religious practice and count- less rebirths. This dogma might have been acceptable to the Indians with their own pecu- liar concept of time and space. In their quest for salvation, however, the practical minded Chinese adherents of Buddhism were seeking a more tangible reward for their religious efforts. Believing in an unaltered Self, so ingrained in Chinese thought, they strove for a rapid attainment of Buddhahood in the present life. Sophisticated revisions of original Buddhist doctrines by native Chinese ecclesiastics gave way to new attitudes toward life after death, toward the relation between body and soul, toward immortality and eternity. The complexity of and the manner in which Buddhist and Daoist elements were amalga- mated into this specific Chinese system of beliefs is nearly impossible to summarize suc- cinctly and to trace into all its facets. At the point of peaceful, noble passing from this world into another realm several Chan masters had turned themselves naturally or were turned artificially into mummies.156 The idea of "seated death", zuosi or zuowang (Jap. zashi or zabb), also called "seated end", zuozhong (Jap. zashO), had its root in the old Indian ascetic discipline of "entering nirvana 88 153 See Kawada Sadamu: Busshari to kyb no shogon.

After complete desiccation it was usually tightly covered with hemp cloth or other textiles, then repeatedly coated with layers of lacquer and, if necessary, partially remodelled with lacquer paste. Finally clay and plaster could be applied as well as gilding. 158 Faure: op. cit.

"Meditation in a cave", yanku ruding (Jap. gankutsu nyujft), aimed at a complete extinction of body and mind, of sensation and thought, of passion and illu- sion; it might be considered identical to death except for a sense of warmth, spiritual presence, and consciousness. The so-called nirodha samapatti or "cessation samadhi", miejinding (Jap. metsujinjd), ranks among the highest forms of Kenosis or "Enlightened Emptiness", which results from ecstatic contemplation, chanding (Jap. zenjf), and qui- escence, and ultimately leads to nirvana. This severe, final meditation of "seated end" combined with the rejection of food or at least its limitation to a minute meagre diet excluding all cereals was the first step toward self-mummification. It was the radical attempt to finalize and complete this existence here and now through the fundamental Buddhist precept of "Becoming Buddha in One's Present Body", sokushinjobutsu, which was to gain prominence as essential doctrine of the Shingon school commented upon by KUkai (774-835) in his Sokushin jdbutsugi. The ideology of self-mummification or preservation of the dead body was obviously influenced by - but not identical with - Daoist eschatological thoughts and practices. After having been properly cleaned, treated with specific desiccatory techniques, lacquered and gilded,157 the mummified masters of meditation were installed in a stupa or special structure for worship known as zhenshenyuan, "Abode of the True Body". Their corpses were turned into sacred icons which became objects of devotional sacrifices and focal points in cultic centers of pil- grimage.158 In his Song gaoseng zhuan, "Song Collection of Biographies of Eminent Monks", completed in 988, the author Zanning (919-1001) mentions the Tang monk Suiduan of the Derun Monastery in Mingzhou who died in the year 861; he is said to have been worshiped in such a sepulchral chapel called zhenshenyuan.159 The distinguished Buddhist scholar Zanning also turns to the question of mummies and relics in his bio- graphical account on the Tang master Anjing. In the year 727 the Westerner Anjing wan- dered eastward to a place called Dingtao in order to contact a certain Buddhist "layman", jushi, by the name of Ding. But he was told that Ding had passed away three years ear- lier. Anjing went to his tomb outside the town and opened it. A five-coloured cloud appeared and Ding's true Bodhisattva Nature became manifest in his "totally golden bones", gujielinse. Zanning comments upon the layman Ding that "now his bones have a locked shape", gu you gousuo xing, like the "linked skeletons" of Buddhist and Daoist saints. But "the norm for a Buddha is, that his entire body is a relic," Fo ze quan shen sheli yan.160 As a rule sacred relics were concealed in stupas and pagodas as proper places for eternal rest. But unlike these invisible relics the "iconized" roushen or "flesh bodies" could be perceived in their lasting existence. They were "present" in a very real sense. Among the early masters of meditation, the fourth patriarch Daoxin (580-651) apparently was the first to be mummified post mortem by his followers. One year after his corpse had been enshrined in a stupa on Mt. Huangmei in Hubei Province, Daoxin miraculously reappeared. Du Fei, probably identical with the Dharma Master Fei, recorded around 720 the incident in his "Annals of the Transmission of the Dharma Treasure", Chuan fabao ji: The stone doors opened themselves and his countenance was as majestic as the days when he was alive. His disciples subsequently added lacquered cloth [to the body] and did not dare to reclose the doors. They cut stone and engraved a tablet. Du Zhenglun (587-658), president of the Department of the Imperial Grand Secretariat, composed the text praising his virtue. 161 The most famous mummy is the one of the sixth Chan patriarch Huineng (638-713). Several accounts unanimously agree that he urged his disciples one year before he died to hurry with the erection of a grave pagoda at his home monastery, the Guoensi. His "flesh body" was probably identical with the lacquered image in the "Hall of the Sixth Patriarch", liuzudian, of the Nanhua Monastery at Caoqi in ancient Shaozhou (modern Qujiang), Guangdong Province.162 U~nfortunately the impressive statue of the emaciated seventy-five year old Chan master is said to have vanished in the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. Before the tragic end Huineng's mortal remains appear to have experienced quite a dramatic fate.163 According to the Song gaoseng zhuan164 and Daoyuan's "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007]", 165 the mas- ter himself predicted that several years after his death someone would come and try to 89</page><page sequence="85">steal his head. For safety reasons his disciples are said to have secured his "true body", zhenshen, by means of iron plates and lacquered cloth. Fragments of the historical Buddha's cranium as well as skulls of eminent ecclesiastics have been treasured and venerated as precious relics by dedicated Buddhists throughout the ages.166 The at- tempted theft of Huineng's head purportedly occurred in 722 on behalf of a Korean monk named Kim Taebi who desperately wanted to worship the skull relic of the sixth patriarch in his homeland. The Korean tradition maintains that this adventurous enterprise ended successfully. In the precincts of the Ssanggyesa, a Buddhist temple founded during the ninth century in a secluded valley at Mount Chiri in the southern part of the Republic of Korea, a seven-storey relic pagoda allegedly protects the cranium of the venerated Chan master until the present day.167 In Huineng's long, emphatic farewell verse for his disciples entitled "Self-Nature True Buddha Emancipation" at the end of "The Platform Su-tra" we find the sokushin jbbutsu idea expressed with slightly different wording: If within your own body you yourself have the True, Where the True is, there is the means of becoming Buddha. If you do not seek the True yourself and seek the Buddha outside, All your seeking will be that of a highly ignorant man. 168 The hair of the sixth patriarch is said to have been enshrined in an octagonal seven-storey pagoda at the Guangxiaosi in Guangzhou (Canton) after he had received tonsure on the 15th day of the first month in the year 676 before a gathering of illustrious monks at the hands of the Dharma Master Yinzong at the Faxing Monastery.169 Although the historical validity of the sources which provide some information on this event may be limited they nevertheless shed some light on the veneration of Huineng's hair as sacred relic through later generations. This appears to be also true for his patriarchal insignia, his robe and his bowl. They were transferred in 760 by the order of Emperor Suzong (reigned 756-762) to the court so that they might be worshiped in the capital. Only five years later, however, his successor on the throne returned them to their original place as instructed in a dream encounter with the deceased Chan master. Again the Jingde chuandeng lu relates the following: On the fifth day of the fifth month of the first year of Yongtai [May 29, 765] the Emperor Daizong [reigned 762-779] had a dream in which the Sixth Patriarch asked for [the return of] the robe and bowl. On the seventh day an imperial order was issued to the prefect Yang Jian. "I have had a dream in which the Chan Master Huineng requested that the robe which represents the transmission of the Dharma be returned to Caoqi. I have now ordered Liu Chongling, the Grand General of Defense, to return it to you with due reverence. I regard it as a National Treasure. Let it be installed properly at the head temple, and be strictly guarded by special priests, who have been recipients of the main tenets of the teaching. Great care must be taken so that it is not lost." Although in later years people did steal the robe, they did not get far with it, and it was always retrieved. This happened several times. 170 During his lifetime Huineng did not attract much notice either among the court elite or the clerical establishment of the north despite his reported popularity in the south. He was untrained in the subtleties of Buddhist metaphysics and liturgical matters. Throughout his entire career he obviously did not pay much attention to formal observance of rituals. In his view ultimate religious enlightenment was to be attained in the context of one's daily life. Along with the relics of the founding patriarch of Chan in China, the Indian Bodhi- dharma, and those of his official heirs Huineng's relics came to occupy a predominant position in the religious practice of the Damozong or Bodhidharma school of the late Tang Dynasty strongly influenced by the ?arfra cult of the esoteric Buddhist schools.171 In Japan the Shingon- and TendaishD also looked back on a long established tradition of veneration of relics and sacred objects, when the Darumashii was supposedly intro- duced toward the end of the twelfth century by the Zen master Nbnin, who died prob- ably between 1189 and 1196. The definite emphasis on the worship and transmission of ?arlra in the Darumashil appears at first glance highly contradictory to the essence of 90 166 In Yang Xuanzhi's sixth-century classic Luoyang qielan ji "The Account of Tao-jung reads: After arriving in the state of Na-chia-lo-a (Nagarahara, in modern Jalalabad, Afganistan) [we found] a piece of Buddha's bone from the top of his skull, square [outside] and round [inside], four inches long and beige in color. At the lower end of the bone was a hole [big enough] to insert a finger; lining the in- side were [tiny pockets] as numerous as the cells of an inverted hornet's nest."

Bodhidharma's and Huineng's intuitive Zen teaching, which was not dependent upon rigid adherence to carefully graded rituals and intellectual exercises, but laid claim to an unwritten doctrine transmitted from mind to mind among ignorant as well as educated people. Patriarchal regalia, however, such as Dharma robes and bowls as well as written documents, portraits, and mummies had long been esteemed as qualifying credentials in the legitimate line of succession. The rivalry over the possession of such patriarchal relics and their importance for the legitimate transmission of the "Buddha Flame" may have sometimes prevailed over doctrinal concerns. Although mummification was by no means restricted to Chan circles, the number of recorded "flesh bodies" of masters of meditation - particularly founders of branches or schools - is remarkably high. The iconized body of Yunmen Wenyan (864-949), the founding father of one of the dom- inant Chan schools named after him, was one of those. His lacquered and gilded mummy was kept in the Founder's Hall of his "Monastery of the Gate of the Clouds" near Ruyuan west of Shaoguan in South China until the mid-1970s. It also disappeared during the Cultural Revolution and was replaced by a modern wooden replica.172 In compliance with his own last instructions, Yunmen's dead body - having remained unchanged for quite some time - was transferred to the burial site in his living quarters and an epitaph was donated by the sovereign. Ten and fifteen years after the master's death two large com- memorative stone stelae were erected at Yunmensi. They provide most valuable infor- mation on Yunmen's biography, his burial ceremony, and the original appearance of the flourishing Chan monastery upon which the last ruler of the Southern Han Empire bestowed the honorary name Dajuesi, "Monastery of the Great Awakening". The dedica- tion of the second epitaph was inspired by a miracle. The imperial official Chen Shouzhong records in his inscription of 964 the dream of the local magistrate Ruan Shaozhuang in which Yunmen appeared and ordered that his stupa be opened. "When it was opened, the master's body was found unchanged except that its hair and finger- and toenails had grown longer. The eyes were half open and glistened like pearls, the teeth sparkled like snow, and a mystical glow filled the whole room. Several thousand monks and lay persons are said to have witnessed this. By imperial edict the mummy of Yunmen was brought with great ceremony into Guangzhou, the capital, where it was hon- ored for an entire month - even by the current ruler Liu Chang, who had more sympathy for Daoism. [...] The mummy was returned to the Yunmen Monastery, where it remained for more than one thousand years."173 If the aspired self-mummification of a Buddhist patriarch failed to be successfully final- ized, his disciples sometimes incinerated his corpse and used the ashes as sacrae reliquiae. The "incorporation" of saintly ashes along with votive offerings into statues was by no means limited to esoteric cult images. Chan statuary made use of it as well. Literary sources tell us that since the middle of the fifth century in China, portrait statues of emi- nent monks were made, into which the mortal remains of the saint were either worked into the clay, after his cremation, so-called "images with bones and ashes", guhuixiang (Jap. koppaizb), or the ashes of the incinerated saint, yihui (Jap. yuikal), were mixed with the clay to be used for the statue. 174 The bookish Tang official Duan Chengshi (803-863) tells us in his "Notes on Temples and Pagodas", Sitaji, compiled in 843 and edited in 853, that he saw at the "Bodhi Temple", Putisi, of the Pingkang Ward in the old capital city of Chang'an the clay statue of an anonymous Buddhist priest who had burned himself and was popularly known as Shucao shi, "Master Straw-Bundle": Also the temple once had a monk, whose name was not told us, who was always carry- ing a bundle of straw on his back. He would sit or sleep in the temple's two verandah corridors, refusing to live in a precinct. After several years the temple's comptroller once urged him to go to a dormitory. He answered, 'You are disturbing me'. That night he used his bundle of straw to burn up his body. On the morrow only his ashes remained, with- out any smell of blood or fat. The brethren realized then that he was no common man. They moulded his ashes into an image, which until the present day was in the Buddha Hall. People call it "the straw-bundle master")175 The Putisi is said to have been founded in 582. Therefore the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that the incident happened centuries ago and that the clay image of the sacred monk could well date back to the seventh or even late sixth century, since Duan Chengshi 91</page><page sequence="87">I -i seems to be slightly surprised that it was still in existence when he visited the monastery. According to the Song gaoseng zhuan a portrait statue incorporating the ashes of the deceased was made of the Korean preceptor Kim, in Chinese known as Jin Heshang or under his clerical name Wuxiang (680-756). "His relics were mixed into clay [to become]. a true form of the original appearance", yuan qi xiang zhi shell fensu zhen xing. Wuxiang is said to have entered China in 726 and taught Chan for over twenty years at the Jingzhong Monastery of Chengdu in Sichuan Province.176 It appears rather paradoxical and yet sophisticated that one of the founders of the Baotang school whose name liter- ally means "without distinguishing features", wuxiang, should be commemorated by a very distinguished icon, xiang, incorporating his original bodily remains. A more affirma- tive rendition of this term stresses the repletion of the fruition qualities of Buddhahood. It suggests the ultimate truth which is so transcendent to ordinary ways of perceiving and knowing that it is basically devoid of any characteristics and features, simply formless. The implantation of a saint's or patriarch's mortal remains hidden to the eyes of poster- ity undoubtedly also hints at the magical nature of relic portraiture. Clay images contain- ing sacred ashes apparently became popular around the middle of the eighth century, when mummies or lacquered "flesh bodies" had already become an established category of Chan portraiture. The oldest extant reliquary portrait of this kind is the 94 cm high, coloured clay statue in cave No. 17 at Dunhuang in Gansu Province, depicting the Buddhist abbot Hongbian immersed in meditation.

When the statue was removed from its temporary place in cave No. 362 and restored to its original site in 1965, an examination showed that there was a sealed aperture measuring 8 x 9 cm in its back containing, besides a sheet of paper with writ- ings on both sides, a silk satchel with ashes inside.177 There can hardly be any doubt that the ashes are the mortal remains of the portrayed prelate Hongbian. Following the Chinese example, it became a wide-spread Buddhist custom in medieval Japan to heighten the redemptive power of cult images by enclosing precious relics and votive offerings. Again and again, careful scientific examination and restoration work bring sacred deposits to light, and such relics have come to be called butsuzdnai nonyuhin, "consecrated objects enclosed in Buddhist statues".178 This custom seems to be particularly apt in the case of portrait sculpture, since the image of a revered master transcended its memorial function as tsuibozo and acquired a deeper dimension by the presence of his physical essence and his doctrine in condensed form. Okotsu Daishi zo, "Effigy of the Great Master of the Revered Bones", is the unusual, popular name of a por- trait statue of the learned Japanese Tendai patriarch Enchin (814-891) with the honorary title Chisho Daishi at the Kara'in of Onjoji, Shiga Prefecture.179 According to traditional sources of the monastery, Enchin commissioned the 85.1 cm high, coloured wooden sculpture and ordered his disciples to keep his mortal remains in it after his death. At the bottom of the statue, a wooden plate covers an aperture of 17 x 10 cm in which the relics of the Tendai patriarch are most likely deposited. Zen Buddhism also sometimes observed this custom in the creation of wooden portrait statuary. Among the most impressive examples is the chinzo of one of the pioneers of Zen Buddhism in Japan, Shinchi (Muhon) Kakushin (1207-1298), better known under his honorary title "National Master of the Dharma Flame", HattO (Hottd) Kokushi. After his ordination at Todaiji in Nara and esoteric studies at the leading Shingon center on Koyasan, he turned to Zen and went to China in 1249 in order to deepen his under- standing of meditative Buddhism in the foremost Chan monasteries. After his return in 1254, he retired to Saihoji, a small monastery in today's Wakayama Prefecture, founded in 1227 and renamed Kokokuji in his honour in 1258.180 This monastery owns one of the most important portrait paintings of the illustrious prelate, signed at the lower edge on the right by Kaku'e, one of his artistically most gifted disciples (Fig. 64).181 Unfortunately, the pigments of the colourful portrait have peeled off the silk just in the area of the face, leaving only vague traces of the distinguished physiognomy with the high front of the bare head, the bushy eyebrows, the marked cheekbones, the angular jaws and the small mouth. In the upper part, the large scroll (174.8 x 84.2 cm) bears an inscription by the influential Chinese Zen abbot Yishan Yining (1247-1317), in which he gives expression to his admiration for Shinchi Kakushin deceased at 92. He did not have an opportunity to meet the subject of the portrait, since he came to Japan only in 1299, a year after Kakushin's death, to take up his activity as a Zen master. In the Founder's Hall, kaisandd, of Kokokuji, a portrait sculpture stands to this day, demonstrating the striking appearance of the ascetic Hatto Kokushi, adamant in the strict adherence to the order's regulations and to meditational sitting, zazen. 182 When restora- tion work had to be done at the 82.5 cm high statue in 1933, a number of votive offer- ings were discovered inside: six fundamental Buddhist suitra texts, a small, gilt bronze "five-ring pagoda" or gorintd183, a cylindrical "[relic] container for the bones", kotsuzdki (H. with cover 22.7 cm, D. 9.7 cm) and a "suitra cylinder", kydzutsu (H. 37.3 cm, D. 20.5 cm), both also of gilt bronze (Fig. 63).184 The smaller of the two covered cylindrical con- tainers was put into the larger one. On the outside of the larger cylinder, the names of 68 disciples of Shinchi Kakushin, most of them with the clerical rank of jdza, "[occupant of the] upper seat", are written in ink. The long list of kechi'ensd, the monks who were espe- cially close to their master, ends with a dedication, ganmon, for their Ddchd Dai Oshd, their "Master of the Halls and High Eminence [Shinchi Kakushin]" as well as the date: "415th day of the third month in the ninth year of the Koan [era, 1286)." It would appear that the followers commissioned the portrait statue for the eightieth birth- day of the master to manifest their deep veneration and their respect for the eminent abbot. In a solemn gathering, they gave expression to their affinity with him. Without a doubt, the aged abbot was present and could pass judgment on his portrait. By having 93</page><page sequence="89">their names inscribed on the container which was to receive not only the sotra scrolls but also the relic container itself with the ashes of the portrayed master, the disciples wanted to ensure their union with the effigy while the master was still alive. Thus, they could sur- round the holy substance of his body at least with their names beyond the boundaries of life and death "in harmony with the Dharma and the totality of all Holy Scriptures", nyohc kyoshO, as the inscription on the kyozutsu says. Shinchi Kakushin died only twelve years later, in 1298. In fact, such a reliquary cult ante mortem - especially in Zen Buddhism - is extremely unusual, and a portrait sculpture made during the lifetime of a Zen master, juzo, used as reliquary, koppaizo, of the portrayed person himself is a paradoxical phe- nomenon. In his "Dharma Talks" the master of meditation speaks in rather pragmatic terms about life and death; the short chapter is entitled "Beginning and End of the Body": If we consider the beginnings of our bodies, the white bones represent the vitality of the father, the red flesh that of the mother. The mother conceives and the four elements come together to produce the form of a human body. After ten months [a child] is born and it gradually becomes a person. When hungry it eats; when cold it wears clothing. The entire life is spent in this way. What can one do? Everything a person does is a cause of karma. You cannot escape the four sufferings: birth, old age, illness, death. The four elements disperse and return to their original state. It is nothing that you or anyone else can escape. How pitiable! How pitiable!185 Shinchi Kakushin had already been portrayed by an unknown sculptor probably ten years earlier, in 1276. The 85.1 cm high sculpture is extant at Ankokuji in Hiroshima (Fig. 62).186 This sculpture, too, contained votive offerings and documents which were discovered during repair works in 1942. In addition to a restoration report dating to 1664, again a miniature gorinto - like the one in the other Shinchi Kakushin statue, but made of crys- tal (H. 6.8 cm) - in a wooden box and a scroll with writings by the hand of the portrayed master were found (Fig. 65). The latter shows, on the one hand, the master's lifelong interest in the mystic thought of esoteric Buddhism, and, on the other hand, his venera- tion for his Chinese Chan master Wumen Huikai (1183-1260) who has gone down in the history of religion and literature as the compiler of the classic kcan collection "Gateless Barrier", Wumenguan or Mumonkan. The scroll is 11.2 cm high and 51.8 cm long; in its last third, it contains a gath5 which Wumen Huikai dedicated to his Japanese disciple and which Shinchi Kakushin made to the fundamental axiom of his creed: The mind is the Buddha The Buddha is the mind. Mind and Buddha, such as they are, Are identical past and present. 187 The gath5 is followed by an unmistakable hint to the religious concept underlying the zcnai ncnyuhin: butsu - "Buddha", ho - "Dharma", so - "monks' congregation". These "Three Treasures", sanbc, constitute the foundation of Buddhism. Relics or reliquiaries, often symbolized by a gorintc, represent the bodily essence of the Enlightened One; sitras and other holy scriptures proclaim his doctrine, the Sacred Law; and the names mentioned in records of dedication, the "Words of Vow", ganmon, and other documents refer to the community of the monks and lay followers, sarpgha. At the end of the scroll, the signature is accompanied by the date: "18th day of the 12th month in the first year of the Kenji[era, i.e., January 5, 1276]." There is hardly any doubt that the Zen master wrote this document in order to have it deposited in his portrait sculpture, and that the statue was consecrated at the beginning of 1276. Maybe the portrait was commissioned for the completion of his seventieth year, an event he could celebrate, in accordance with East-Asian calculation, in 1276, together with the fiftieth anniversary of his tonsure which he received in 1226. If these hypotheses are correct, the Ankokuji portrait sculpture of Hatto Kokushi is not only the oldest chinz5 extant, but at the same time the oldest ]uzo, Zen portrait done during the lifetime of a master. The "incorporation" of relics, votive offerings, and written documents into portrait sculp- tures was by no means only the desire and idiosyncrasy of a Zen master initiated into the magic-mystical practices of the Shingon school. Not only the followers of esoteric Buddhism aspired "to become Buddha in this very body", sokushin ]cobutsu.

Under the deeply sagging upper eyelids of the inlaid crys- tal eyes, gyokugan kannyG, the master appears to be cross-eyed.

A spherical relic container made of green glass, sharitsubo (H. 2.7 cm), contained the brocaded silk remains of a relic satchel, nishiki fukuro. Most likely, one of these relic containers also held traces of the mortal remains of the Zen master. The latter himself supposedly carved another gorintb, made of painted wood (H. 12.4 cm). Beside a cubic, lacquered wooden box (H. 11 cm), a fragrant wood piece, kcboku (L. 5.2 cm), three sil- ver foils, ginpaku, and a bronze ring (D. 1.4 cm), the sculpture contained various written documents, among them a printed version of the Shoson zuzd darani, also known as Kokono'e no mamori (only 7.2 cm high, but 925 cm long), dated to 1285; a copy of the Sanskrit "seed syllables of the Six Saints", Rokuson shuji, brushed by Mukan Fumon, as well as a handwritten list, dated to 1789 and evidently added during an earlier restora- tion, of the reliquary deposits. This is one of the richest treasures of relics inside a Buddhist image ever found (Fig. 69). Upon his return in 1269/70 from a seven years' stay in China, the relatively young, only thirty-six-year-old Zozan Junkul (1233-1308) stayed for a short time at his home monastery, Tofukuji, and was subsequently appointed founding abbot of KOjOji in today's Saga Prefecture in KyushO. There, he taught with great success for more than a decade before he became abbot of Jotenji in Hakata, Fukuoka Prefecture. In 1300, he received a highly honourable appointment to the metropolitan Tofukuji where he was installed as sixth abbot in a solemn ceremony on the 25th day of the 11th month in the second year of the Shcan [era, i.e., January 5, 1301]. Here, he had begun his religious life under the founding abbot Enni Ben'en (1202-1280), and here he had the Yomei'in erected as his retirement residence toward the end of his life. In memory of the "Zen Master of the Round Mirror", Enkan Zenji, the honorary title bestowed on him, his disciples at Kojoji commissioned a 85.8 cm high portrait sculpture and deposited in the head of the statue, in addition to sacred scriptures, two dedicatory documents or "Words of Vow", ganmon, dated to the year 1300 and discovered more than six centuries later, in 1918, during restoration work at the statue.191 The life-like chinzc, showing the abbot at the age of 67 radiating benevolence and human warmth, served his disciples mainly as substitute "re- animation" of their spiritual model, as tsuibozc, "memorial image". Since they could no longer have him among them in persona, they wanted him to be at least present in effigie before their eyes.

Fig. 70 The character Shun, "Spring" from the name Shun'oku, by Musb Soseki (1275-1351) for his disci- ple Shun'oku Mybha (1311-1388), dated 1346. Rokub'in, Kybto (No.40). Sho in Japanese means "writing" or "script" and the "way of writing", shoddy, refers to the creative process as well as the result of the written word as an art form of high aesthetic value. Of old, the command of the writing system has been synonymous with erudition in China since the complexity of the characters - many of them consisting of up to thirty and more strokes - as well as their great number allowed proficiency only to a small elite after years of intensive practice. Together with poetry, music, and painting, the art of writ- ing is considered as the mother of all fine arts. In this culture characterized by painting and the art of writing, the writing system is not only a means for the optical recording of thoughts, but, according to traditional Chinese art theory, it reveals at the same time the character and personality of the writer. Moreover, since many ideographs retain a strong pictorial element, despite highly abstract stylization, they inspire, especially when they are large and powerfully written in an isolated space, an abundance of associations and encompass a whole range of multi-layered meanings. They partake of a larger spiritual dimension than words recorded by the mechanic-analytical means of phonetic letters. There are a number of reasons for the intimate relation between writing and painting. Many ideographs themselves were originally pictures, and painting, at least in its begin- nings, was an art of linear drawing which developed into a genuine, independent art form side by side with the art of writing. In this process the rhythmic laws of the two seem to have fertilized each other mutually. Every educated man was in command of the three disciplines - painting, writing, and poetry - often combining them in a single work of art of highly individual character. Both the art of writing and painting revealed the dialectic between black and white, light and dark, positive and negative. The decisive prerequi- site, however, for the development of the writing system, and, at the same time, for its close relation to painting, is the use of the same materials for both: the absorbent, strong paper or the densely woven silk as ground of the writing or painting, the "colourful" ink, and especially the flexible hair brush with its extraordinary characteristics as writing and painting instrument. The brush follows each movement of the hand and the arm in living flow. It registers almost seismographically the slightest change of pressure and every alteration of direction, whether quick or slow, angular or rounded, and at the same time reveals even minute insecurity of the hand. At the latest since the Kamakura period (1185-1333), writings of Zen Buddhist monks have been called bokuseki, "ink traces", in Japan. In China, where the two characters are read moji, the term seems to have existed since the Six Dynasties period (221 -589), a crucial epoch for the development of the art of writing. But only during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) did it take on the meaning of "the art of writing" in general as one of a num- ber of such expressions. Finally, the compound got its limited, specific meaning still valid today by the Japanese pilgrim monks travelling to China. In the Butsunichi'an kdmotsu mokuroku, an inventory of Chinese art treasures in the collection of the cloister of Engakuji in Kamakura mentioned in the title, compiled in 1363 on the basis of an older list dating to 1320, an anonymous scroll of writing and one by the illustrious Chan mas- ter Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) are called "ink traces".192 However, the term shinseki, 99</page><page sequence="95">"true or genuine vestiges" is used more often, and sometimes "brush traces", hisseki, is encountered. All these terms imply two essential aspects of Zen Buddhist writing: on the one hand, the traces left on the silk or paper by brush and ink during the act of writing emphasize the creative process that can be re-enacted even in its final result, and on the other hand, they refer to the unadulterated individuality and the true character of the writer. In a Chinese treatise concerning the history and theory of art and dating to around 1080, the author Guo Ruoxu likens personal signatures with "seal impressions of the mind", xinyin, and adds that the art of writing springs from the fountainhead of the mind, is completed in the imagination, and takes shape as "trace". By citing the Han Dynasty philosopher and poet Yang Xiong (53 B.C -18 A.D.), he exalts handwritten works as highly expressive documents: Words are the sounds of the mind [xinsheng], writing, its depiction [xinhua]. When the sounds and depiction come into being, the distinction between the gentleman Uunzi] and the petty man [xiaoren] is evident. 193 This attitude was transmitted for centuries and can also be found in the writings of Mi Youren (1072-1152), who liked to call his own paintings innocuous moxi, "ink plays". Ziyun [Yang Xiong] considered written characters to be the depictions of the mind [xin- hua]. If he had not thought [about this matter] profoundly, he could not have reached this conclusion. To give a definition of painting, it is also the depiction of the mind [xinhua]. In the past everyone who was an exceptional talent worked in this way, but how can com- mon painters be expected to understand?194 Like Mi Youren, the highly erudite literatus Huang Tingjian (1045-1105), a contemporary of Guo Ruoxu, often used in his writings Buddhist terminology unmistakably influenced by Chan thought. This is not surprising, since he was close to several masters of medi- tation, among them the painter-monk Huaguang Zhongren (died 1123) celebrated for his monochrome ink paintings of plum blossoms. Thus Huang's "Collected Works" contain the following passage: I used to say of writing that brushwork in characters is like insight in the sayings of the Ch'an masters. 195 By this Huang Tingjian meant that in order to penetrate the spirit and the essence of the art of writing, neither indefatigable study nor zealous exercises and copying were of any help; only intuitive empathy, attained in a flash-like moment of enlightenment, could reveal the substance of the work. Huang Tingjian's "ink traces" were highly esteemed in Zen circles of medieval Japan. Huang himself used to say that there was no acknow- ledged method underlying his art of writing. He felt free from tradition and orthodoxy and his writing style is indeed characterized by spontaneous unconventionality. The declared ambition of Zen masters was to give visible expression to their own true self, following the example of independent literati and aspiring to the ideal of their creed. Mindful of old Buddhist practice, the act of writing was a quasi-sacred part of this endeavour. But for the bunjinsb, the "literati monks", the art of writing was at the same time an artistic-aes- thetic exercise for the cultural enhancement of one's character. Often, the unadulterated individual sediment of the writer's personality in an "ink trace" was bound to open up new, hardly explored boundaries. This kind of writing was not "cal- ligraphy" in the original sense of the word, not "beautiful handwriting" in impersonal con- formity and with aesthetically attractive, decorative intention. It rather lead to a kind of non- calligraphyh, by its unpretentious, almost rustic simplicity in conscious renunciation of classic, conventional writing styles and in opposition to canonical formalism. In this light it becomes evident that the term "calligraphy" - largely avoided here on purpose - does not do justice to the specific character of artistic writing since the bokuseki of the Zen masters are anything but "beautiful writing". Rather, an ideograph, a maxim, a poem, an artistically written text brushed by a master's hand transcends its significance as a 100 93 Bush: op. cit., pp. 20 and 187:16, and Susan Bush and Hslo-yen Shih, compiled and edited: Early Chinese Texts on Painting.

In Bokuseki soshiden, "Transmitted Ink Traces of the Patriarchs", pub- lished by Fujino So'iku in 1805, Zen Buddhist works of written art of no fewer than 223 prominent masters are compiled; 119 among them are Chinese, 104 Japanese.197 Although, or maybe precisely because, Zen set narrow limits to pious text worship and instead emphasized immediate personal transmission of fundamental Buddhist insights, i.e., "transmission from mind to mind", yixin chuanxin (Jap. ishin denshin), the "true trace" inherent in the written word of an experienced religious master was bound to be of even greater importance to the follower. For the Zen adept, the following documents, some of them of great artistic value, had the function - beside their literal content - to allow a spir- itual communication with the writer beyond all spatial-temporal dimensions: 1. hdgo, "Dharma words", in the form of essays or poems, often containing personal suggestions for the Zen disciple to assist him in his search for spiritual maturity or enlightenment. 2. fuhdjd, instructions concerning the succession of the master's doctrine or his office, addressed to the disciple selected for that task. 3. shinddgo, encouraging "words for the progress along the way" toward enlightenment by an experienced master to younger monks and lay followers. Such inciting admoni- tions were sometimes called kydsaku or keisaku, a term referring originally to the admonishing staff used during meditative sitting to maintain the spiritual alertness of the zazen practitioner. 4. inkajf, "certificates of approbation" or "competence seals", certifying that the disciple has fulfilled all conditions required for mastership. 5. jigb or ddgd, "confirmation names", usually written in two large characters and bestowed on outstanding Zen disciples at their approbation. 6. dbgdsetsu, "explanations concerning the name of the way", revealing the meaning and the reasons for the selection of the name. 7. yuige, "death gatha" or "departing verse", written by the master immediately before his death, epitomizing his doctrine and life in Chinese verse, and thus constituting his spiritual testament. 8. geju, verses or gathjs in which essential Zen themes are addressed, sometimes in conventional verse meter and rhyme, sometimes free of any metric norm. 9. shi, classic "old poems", koshi, especially by celebrated Chinese poets, or poems composed by the writer with a personal flair. 10. jisan or gasan, inscriptions by a Zen master on paintings dedicated to a friend or a pupil, especially on chinzb, portraits, sdbetsuzu, "farewell paintings", and hbyuzu, "paintings of visits to friends". 11. sdbetsugo, "farewell words", in the form of poems or short aphorisms. 12. sekitoku or shokan, epistles or letters. 13. shingi, rules and injunctions for monastic life. 14. kankinbb, wooden announcement boards, proclaiming e.g. the title of a sutra to be read. 101</page><page sequence="97">15. haiji, wooden announcement boards with large characters, displayed in the buildings of a monastery on certain occasions. 16. gakuji, "frontal characters", plaques with large, poster-like characters, indicating the function or the name of buildings in a monastery and usually hung above the entrance. As for the form and content of their written works of art, the medieval Japanese Zen mas- ters of the brush followed quite faithfully Chinese models which they knew either first hand from their studies in China or with which they were acquainted by the works of Chinese masters residing in Japan. Schools of writing developed in Zen circles and monasteries just as they did in aristocratic coteries. Along with the master's Dharma mind his writing style would be emulated and transmitted in successive generations of faithful disciples. Among the pioneers and most influential promulgators of continental Zen cul- ture were Lanqi Daolong (Jap. Rankei Doryu, 1213-1287) and Yishan Yining (Jap. Issan Ichinei, 1247-1317), whom the Mongol Emperor Chengzong (reigned 1295-1308) seems to have forced to participate in a diplomatic mission to Japan under the cover of his reli- gious function (No. 20).198 Upon his arrival in Japan, he came under suspicion as a spy of the Yuan regime and was put under house arrest in a remote monastery in Kyushu until the error was discovered and he was rehabilitated. A pronounced intellectual represen- tative of the Chan clergy, Yishan Yining was instrumental in the proliferation of Chinese culture especially in Kyoto and Kamakura. He was as familiar with the ideas of Confucian philosophy as with the traditions of Chinese historical writings and classic literature. Japan is indebted to him for the introduction of Song poetry, its basic rules, techniques, and styles, and he became one of the pivotal founders of the enduring literary movement known as gozan bungaku, "Literature of the Five Mountains". Its most important lumin- aries in the second generation were Gido Shushin (1325-1388) and Zekkai Chushin (1336-1405).199 These two abbots were close friends and are considered the "double pil- lar" of gozan literature: Gido as master of poetry, Zekkai as master of prose. In the great Rinzai institutions, the sinophile Zen monks formed "literary circles", yusha, devoted to philological studies as well as Buddhist theoretical writings, to memoirs as well as kanbun poetry and prose, i.e., literature in Chinese language. All these literary activities of the medieval Zen monks - in the beginning characterized by creative originality, in the course of time, however, increasingly turning into commentary works - have been handed down in numerous, voluminous compilations.200 In his poem "Snowy Night" (No. 37), evidently written on the spur of the moment on an icy winter's night at the beginning of the year 1316, less than two years before his death, Yishan Yining alludes in ciphers to venerable patriarchs who sought and found the path to enlightenment in ice and snow. At the same time, however, the sixty-nine-year-old immigrant monk uses the "quatrain of seven characters per line", shichigon zekku,201 to hint at the uneasiness of his situation brought to his mind once again by the lonely snowy night. The clattering of the wind-shaken window disturbed him: The whole night, the window rattles and makes disturbing sounds; And since / am distressed by other things, too, / have not found clarity for a long time.202 To be sure, Yishan Yining had been entrusted with one of the most prestigious offices of the Japanese Zen clergy when the retired Emperor Go Uda (1267-1324) appointed him as third abbot of Nanzenji in Kyoto. But not even this could abate his homesickness and the dissatisfaction about his teaching efforts in Japan. In addition, he had been suffering since 1306 from badly blurred vision probably caused by cataracts. In the light of these circumstances, his pun with the two characters for "bright" and "shine" in the two auto- biographical statements dedicated to the nun Minghao, the "Brightly Shining One" may assume a further dimension. Frustrated, he blames his fate: [It was not granted to me] to live out my old days on the soil of T'ang [China], but I was forced to cross the seas eastwards. My outward appearance may look dishevelled, but my mind and spirit are exulted, even if I am only rich in years, but poor in [religious] mer- its. I hate the mere blabbering [about] Sakyamuni, [and] about the failure of the Dharma 102 198 Cf. Tamamura: op. cit.

But if I have a [good] sentence for people, they shine [both] brightly before my eyes. Outward I am dried out like brushwood, my heart is hardened like iron. It is quite clear that I do not know how to instruct others [in religion] - all I am doing is to shake my fists noisily and fly into a passion of scolding: on stones I would plant flowers, and fish for turtles in the fire! Thus, all I can do is to entrust myself to the mystic force [of the uni- verse], even if it is not easy for me to [remain aware of] the passing-by of my life.203 In the hanging scroll Setsuya no saku, "Composed in a Snowy Night", belonging to Kenninji in Kyoto, one seems to feel something of the inner anxiety of the old abbot. At first sight, his slender handwriting appears confusing, in disarray like his feelings; the va- riously sized characters stand individually, one by one, in the first line or so, only to lose their firm structure and dissolve into increasingly illegible ciphers in the ever more abbre- viating flow of the brush. Yishan Yining's writing style was characterized by this loose, artless, and sometimes spontaneously abbreviating brushwork using a thin brush, to be seen in numerous extant inscriptions on paintings and other written documents by his hand.204 He was influenced in this style by the "crazy cursive" mode of writing, kuangcao (Jap. kyosc) of the Tang monk Huaisu (737-after 798), admired by the masters of medi- tation as much as by the Song literati around Su Shi (1031-1101) and Huang Tingjian (1045-1105). However, it is also possible that his eye trouble prevented a more rigorous structuring of his handwriting and that he made a virtue of necessity. This psychogram- like scroll by Yishan Yining clearly demonstrates why bokuseki, "ink traces", is such an apt term for the handwritings of Zen monks, and why art theory compared them with "seal impressions of the mind". Before passing away on foreign soil at Nanzen'in in Kybto on the 24th day of the tenth month 1317 at the age of seventy-one (in accordance with eastern calculation) the unhappy Chinese master of meditation wrote the following yuige or "departing verse": I ran wild throughout my life. Buddhas and patriarchs grieve at me in silence. The arrow has already left the bowstring. The void, xukong, is falling to the ground.205 A great admirer of the Yuan master was Muso Soseki (1275-1351), although he did not succeed in finding access to the profound, highly abstract Zen teaching of Yishan Yining. But the young Japanese monk acquired from him a basic knowledge of literature and art. The Chinese literatus advised his Japanese disciples to study the ancient masterworks of writing without slavishly imitating their form and copying their style. He urged them "to strive to understand the idea of purity and simplicity, and to seek the untrammeled, antique qualities lodged within".206 The writings by the hand of Muso Soseki clearly reveal the stylistic debt to his Chinese model in their dynamic freedom and sensitive, graceful brush flow. Among his masterpieces is the pair of scrolls at Rokub'in in Kybto, which he dedicated to his favourite disciple, Shun'oku Mybha (1311-1388), in 1346 (No. 40, Figs. 70-71). The latter had already risen to shuso, the "chief seat", in the monastic hierarchy, when he received the name Shun'oku, literally meaning "Spring Abode". In powerful, dynamic brushstrokes he brought the two jet black characters to paper, placing them side by side and marking the center with his vertical signature: Bokutotsuso, "Old Wooden Stutterer". Notwithstanding his high ecclesiastical esteem and social prestige Muso Soseki often signed his works with this self-deprecating, typical Chinese-style lit- erary name. The seventy-one-year-old master, who at that time had already relinquished his office as abbot of Tenryiji and retired to Ungo'an in Nishiyama, handed the new ]igo or dogo to Shun'oku Mybha together with a "regulated seven-syllable quatrain", shichigon zekku, brushed in elegant gyosho, "semi-cursive writing": A hundred blossoms are originally blossoms of one branch. In the end, I see that all fragrant blossoms are connected with my house. Suddenly, a harmonious life-breath spreads at the opening of the door, And spring's luster accompanies rivers and sandy shores from here. The poem on the right is for Myo5ha, the [occupant of the] chief seat, composed with his 103</page><page sequence="99">name "Spring Abode" Shun'oku, in spring of the year 1346. The "Old Wooden Stutterer" Bokutotsuso, wrote this in Nishiyama. The counterpoint to the abbreviating, resilient brush flow of Yishan Yining and his disciple MusO Soseki is the handwriting of the Chinese Chan master Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339) who arrived in Japan with a group of Chinese and Japanese fellow monks in 1326, barely a decade after Yishan's death. He wrote in a stout, almost portly style, building up the isolated characters of his even, clearly legible "regular script", kaisho, in broad, fat strokes. In their regular sequence, they appear like steady, firm structures. Only rarely does the soft brush saturated with black ink contract certain elements into curves or loops. This is evident, too, in the scroll at the Yamato Bunkakan in Nara, of a shichigon zekku, "regulated quatrain of seven characters" per line, addressed to the abbot of Reishoji, in which Qingzhuo Zhengcheng offers his thanks for a present of mushrooms and chestnuts (No. 39).207 Among the most distinctive and, from a formal point of view, arresting hands is that of Zhongfeng Mingben (1 263-1323). His cursive writings, such as the poem for an unknown disciple, playfully interweaving the name of the recipient, Shanyan or Zengen, "Bene- volent Steadfastness", emanate high formal attraction and reflect the eccentric charac- ter of this self-willed personality (No. 38). At the end, the "Old [Man] of the Illusory Abode [Huanzhu'an]" calls the four-line "five-word poem", gogon zekku, a commentary to the name Shanyan or, if the disciple was Japanese, Zengen. Many Japanese Zen adepts made the pilgrimage to Zhongfeng Mingben, and a goodly number of them returned with a painting or a handwritten certificate. At the Tokiwayama Bunko, Kamakura, there is an encouraging admonition, kybsaku or keisaku, dedicated to a certain Saijisha, the "novice Sai".208 It is thought that the recipient was no other than the eminent bunjinso Tesshu Tokusai (died 1366), the celebrated orchid painter, and, after his return from China, respected Zen abbot. The scroll for Shanyan or Zengen at the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, may have belonged originally with a second scroll showing the two characters of the name in large writing, such as the one written by Muso Soseki for Shun'oku; in that case, the Umezawa scroll would be part of an "explanation of the path name", dbgbsetsu, expounding the mean- ing and reasons for the selection of the monk's name. Most likely, the undated work was written at the beginning of the fourteenth century: it is known that Zhongfeng Mingben constructed the "Illusory Abode", Huanzhu'an, in the year 1300 outside of Suzhou, but left it two years later after declining an appointment to the abbot's chair at Dajuesi on Western Tianmushan and hiding instead in Nanxun (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province). Due to the pliant, pointed brushstrokes, his inimitable writing style is often compared with "wil- low or bamboo leaves". In Chinese, his writing was called liuyeshu, in Japanese sasa no ha kaki. Evidently, the abbot of Tianmushan was much in demand as a passionate, pro- found commentator of Zen Buddhist painting themes. There are numerous independent "ink traces" by his hand, as well as a number of inscriptions - impressive both in style and content - on various kinds of paintings. Such writings are a testament to Zhongfeng Mingben's great artistic empathy and expertise, no doubt partly due to his friendship with Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) - the outstanding artistic personality of that time and one of the most imposing and influential figures in the history of Chinese art - a relationship that was bound to foster Zhongfeng's affinity with the arts. Among the numerous unconventional Zen masters of Japan, Ikkyu Sbjun (1394-1481) is surrounded by a special aura, not only due to his disregard of clerical usage and monas- tic rules in his eccentric life style, but also because, as one of the most eloquent poets and virtuoso writing artists of the Middle Ages, he knew how to give visible expression to his way of thinking, his convictions and his consistent determination. On New Year's day of 1394, he was born as the son of the Emperor Go Komatsu (1377-1433, reigned 1393-1 41 2) and a court lady of the aristocratic Fujiwara family who had to leave the court even before lkkyD's birth. In court circles, he was never acknowledged as a son of the imperial family. When IkkyD was five years old, his mother sent him into a monastery, Ankokuji in Kyoto, to be educated; there he soon caught the attention of his teacher Zbgai Zenkan (1279-1355) by his zeal, deep religious earnestness, as well as by his scholarly and literary talent. At the age of sixteen, lkkyu, discontented with the metro- 104 207Tayama Hbnan: "Seisetsu Shocho no bokuseki", Yamato bunka, No. 28 (Dezember 1958), pp. 31- 33, PI. IX.

At the death of his master, Ikkyut was so desperate that he attempted suicide. In 1415, the young monk found in Kaso Sbdon (1352-1428) a new, extremely severe mas- ter who gave him the "path name" IkkyO, "One Pause" (Fig. 22). Two years later, the twenty-six-year-old monk, intensely longing for enlightenment, was deeply immersed in meditation on a rainy night in a fishing boat on Lake Biwa when he was torn from his trance by the shriek of a crow; in a flash, he attained satori. He refused to accept an approbation certificate, disdaining this often misused practise and, in his opinion, depleted monastic convention. With indignation and holy wrath, he would turn repeat- edly against the corrupt clergy, the hypocrisy, and the abuses in the great Zen institu- tions. Already before the death of his master in 1428, Ikkyui left the Zenkb'an in Katada and spent many years wandering around the countryside, staying in small, secluded monasteries and in the flourishing port town of Sakai where he is said to have been a regular guest at inns and brothels. Not until 1474 did he return to the center of metro- politan life; in that year, the Emperor appointed him abbot of Daitokuji in Kybto in order to supervise the reconstruction of the buildings destroyed during the Onin war. At the advanced age of eighty-seven, he died at Shucon'an, where he had prepared his own tomb years in advance.209 Most of his powerful, rough "ink traces" are characterized by rustic simplicity, arresting spontaneity, and daring nonconformism. They reflect the irritable temper with which Ikkyi confronted his contemporaries, but at the same time they also show his blunt frankness, his confidence in the search for the right Zen way, and not least his exuberant, hard-to- restrain vitality. Even to the viewer unable to read the characters, Ikkyu's handwriting reveals, thanks to its formal quality and spontaneous expressive power, an inkling of the rebellious, impulsive spirit of this popular Zen master. He is the subject of many legends and anecdotes, and a great number of studies about him have been written from the Middle Ages to the present day. One of the extant masterpieces from the hand of Ikkyu Sbjun is the pair of hanging scrolls at Shinju'an of Daitokuji in Kyoto (No. 42, Figs. 72-73); it shows the following old Buddhist maxim: Shoaku makusa - Avoid all Evil. Shuzen bugyb - Pursue all Good. This is the first half of a didactic poem of four lines, the Shichibutsu tsukai no ge, con- sidered to be the source and foundation of the entire Buddhist doctrine; according to tra- 105</page><page sequence="101">dition, it was proclaimed by the "Seven Buddhas of the Past", Kako Shichibutsu. This essential precept can be found in the Ekottarcgama Sutra, Zoichi agongyb in Japanese, which was already translated during the late fourth century into Chinese. In the version of the Sixth Buddha of the Past, the complete verse reads: Avoid all Evil. Pursue all Good. Cleanse your thoughts: This is the teaching of all Buddhas.210 The first two lines are also the core of a tutorial conversation between the Chan monk [Pan] Daolin (741 -824) and the illustrious Tang poet Bai Juyi (772-846) who, during his term as governor of Hangzhou, used to visit the Zen master Niaoke, "Bird's Nest" - a name he received due to his predilection for meditating in the forked branch of a pine tree - on Mt. Qinwang near Hangzhou. It is said that he was so impressed by the teach- ings and the personality of Niaoke that he became his disciple.211 In his KycunshO, "The Crazy Cloud Anthology", Ikkyi Sojun uses this conversation between Niaoke and Bai Juyi to expound to his followers, in a dialectic prose introduction and a poem, the non-dual- ity between good and evil: in answer to the question of the inquisitive poet about the "Broad Meaning of Buddhism", the "Reverend Bird's Nest" is said to have answered with that couplet. Astonished, Bai Juyi replied that even a three-year-old child would under- stand that; whereupon the wise Chan master retorted that, to be sure, a three-year-old child could easily mouth this maxim of the Buddhist doctrine, but that not even eighty- year-old people were able to act upon it. IkkyO concludes his commentary verse in his typical, point-blank directness by noting "That old Zen master's words are worth a thou- sand pieces of gold" and that the saying "Do no evil, do much good" had to be "some- thing the Elder sang while drunk".212 Thus, it is hardly surprising that Ikkyi would keep this quintessential saying of Buddhism in front of his disciples' eyes in large characters on a pair of scrolls. While the first char- acter of each scroll is written in easily legible "regular script", kaisho, the three following characters dissolve in rapid abbreviations into an impetuous, hurried stream of cipher- like, rhythmical brushstrokes. Indeed, the flow of the bristly brush is so fast that in many places it hardly touches the paper, "flying" over the surface, and leaving an "ink trace" lightened by white streaks of the bare paper, aptly called hihaku, "overflown white". Despite the vehemence and the structural dissolution of the individual characters, the trained eye can still follow the writing process in its spontaneous flow, although the abstraction of the characters has reached a degree where reading at first sight is not easy. The same applies to the four characters of Ikkyi's signature in the lower left, writ- ten with a thin brush in one stroke without leaving the paper: Kycunshi hitsu, "Brushed by the Master of the Crazy Cloud". The signature is followed by the square IkkyG seal (Fig. 73) .213 The high, narrow format for a single line quite naturally suggested itself for the couplet. Mycgc ichigy6, "names and titles in one single line", in short ichigybsho (also ichigybgaki or ichigybmono) were used first by Japanese monks and Chinese masters residing in Japan during the thirteenth century, maybe inspired by the custom of Jodo Buddhism to write the six characters of the incantation Namu Amida Butsu in a vertical line of large ideographs. Wu'an Puning (Jap. Gottan Funei, 1197-1276), visiting Japan only for a short time at the beginning of the 1260s, and his younger compatriot Yishan Yining often used this format, although it does not seem to have been used in China. Among the Japanese Zen monks, Jakushitsu Genkb (1290-1367), Sekishitsu Zenkyt (1294-1389), and Tettb Giko (1295-1369) appear to have been the first to attempt and explore this unusual for- mat. Numerous extant portraits, poems, and handwritings reveal lkkyci Sojun as a self-confi- dent personality. Despite his large circle of disciples and many con freres sharing his opin- ions, he felt left alone in his efforts to transmit the true doctrine of authentic Zen that had come down to him from the Chinese masters of old, especially Songyuan Chongyue (1132-1202) and Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269). lkkyu's veneration for the fortieth Jingshan abbot was such that not only did he consider himself as his successor in the seventh 106 i~~~~~~ Fig. 73 Signature and seal of IkkyJ Sdjun (1394-1481) on the Shuzen bugy6 scroll: Kyounshi hitsu, Brushed by the Master of the Crazy Cloud'. 210 Chapter 1, Taisho shinshO daizokyo, No. 125, Vol. 2, p. 551a; cf. also Yamato bunka, No. 41 (August 1964): Special Number Devoted to the Portraits, Autographic Writings and Poetical Works of the Zen Priest IkkyO, No. 18, pp. 71ff. 211 Arntzen: op. cit., pp. 35ff., and Charles Lachman: "Arhats in the Treetops", Artibus Asiae, Vol. LI, 3/4 (1991), pp. 234-256. 212 Yamato Bunka, No. 41 (August 1964), p. 25: 204/ 205, and Arntzen: op. cit., p. 36.</page><page sequence="102">213 Detail photograph in Yamato bunka, No. 41 (August 1964), No. 5 in the compilation of signatures and seals.

Immediately before his death, Ikkyuc wrote the following stanza with large characters in his spiritual testament: South of Mt. Sumeru - Who meets my Zen? Even if Xutang came [in person] It wouldn't be worth half a penny! [So]jun lkkyJ, [the monk] from the Eastern Sea.214 Together with his last, urgent admonitions to his disciples, this death poem is kept and reverently treasured at Shinju'an (Fig. 74). It is a provocative artifact of Ikkyui's eloquent Zen. How much the concentration of the eighty-seven-year-old master was already laps- ing is indicated not only by the uneven size and structure of the characters, but also by the correction in the first line: Ikkyuc forgot the third character, "south", and subsequently had to insert it in small script at the edge.215 What seems to have impressed Ikkyuc about Xutang Zhiyu was his independent, some- times even defiant attitude toward monastic and secular authority. "The master of Mt. Yuwang turned his back on the whole world and abandoned his Dharma robe as though it were a broken sandal", Ikkyui once wrote in praise of his greatly admired Chinese an- cestor whose "poetic message to successive generations", cishisong, at the end of his life has been transmitted in his "Collected Sayings", Xutang Heshang yulu: Eighty-five years, [And still] unconscious of Buddhas and patriarchs. Bracing the arms and going at my convenience, I efface my traces in the greatest void, taixu.216 The tradition of leaving last words of deep religious insight to posterity can be traced back to the beginning of the eighth century when Shenxiu, the patriarch of Northern Chan, died at the "Monastery of the Heavenly Palace", Tiangongsi, in Luoyang on the 28th day of the second month in the year 706. Quietly sitting in meditation posture he set down his brush and wrote the three characters qu qu zhi, which may be translated as "Bent over, curved, and straightened". Shenxiu's spiritual "testament", yizhu, was transmitted by Jingjue (683-ca.750) in his Lengqie shizi ji, "Records of the Masters and Disciples of the Lanka[vatara]".217 The three cryptic words might refer to progressive stages of religious perfection the master felt he had achieved in his lifetime. "Whatever the original intent of this statement, Shen-hsiu's [Shenxiu's] teaching style involved the .4,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I~ 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0</page><page sequence="103">use of perplexingly enigmatic questions, [...] so there is no doubt that his last words were chosen to inspire earnest reflection among his followers." 218 Such "death gcthsas" yuige in Japanese, testifying to the enlightened mind, were expected from every master of meditation. By the Middle Ages the poetic form and con- tent had become rigidly standardized and the custom of writing final statements ritual- ized to a degree that some critical Chan masters expressed serious reservations. Yuanwu Keqin (1063-1135), who also had some doubts about the efficacy of portraiture, wrote at the end of his life on the eighth day of the eighth month in the fifth year of the Shaoxing era: Having already reached the effortless state, wugong, Why should I have to leave a verse? I only have now to yield to circumstances. Farewell! Farewell!219 These reluctant lines may have to be considered as a reaction to an all too inflationary sanctification of yuige as last authentic traces of the brush. Yuanwu's skepticism toward the high esteem of such "departing verses" was shared by other eminent Chan masters of the Song Dynasty. His contemporary Dahui Zonggao (1089-1163) bluntly declared: Birth is thus. Death is thus. Verse or no verse - What's the fuss ?220 Despite their formulaic conventionalism and increasing ritual nature yuige nevertheless represent an essential feature of Zen culture. By the twelfth century death poems had developed into a characteristic genre of Zen writing.221 The majority follows the estab- lished patterns of Chinese prosody, and most of them are composed according to the style of regulated verse as four-character quatrains. Besides observing rather rigid rules that govern tonal system and rhyme scheme, the passing master of meditation had to make a terse enlightened declaration, often combined with a specification of his age and the actual date of writing. To put down one's last will in proper zazen posture was a mat- ter of noble decorum for dying Zen illuminate. Many yuige bear no seals. In place of a sig- nature some medieval Zen masters preferred to use a personal paraph, ka'o (Chin. huaya), a highly individualized cipher of identification. As a compound of "flower", ka, and "to impress one's signature", 6, the term conveys the idea of an elegant flowerlike mono- gram that could not be imitated.222 Generally speaking ka'6, often illegible, were employed with or without signature and seals in order to confirm the authenticity of a document. The funerary ritual for an esteemed Zen prelate included several ceremonies. After the corpse had been enshrined in a coffin, nyugan, and transferred from the abbot's quarter to the Lecture Hall of the monastery, the coffin was closed, sagan, and the death poem attached to the coffin's longitudinal exterior on the left-hand side of the deceased mas- ter. Together with his portrait on a hanging scroll which was hung above the altar, his yuige served as vivid memento especially during the 49-day period of mourning and in later memorial services. The ritual use at the coffin, gan, and the circumstances of cre- ation offer a plausible explanation for the horizontal format of the vast majority of depart- ing verses. They were eventually mounted as hanging scrolls. Yuige represent last concise statements of faith of enlightened individuals, and at the same time they are important historical documents of a monastery's great succession of abbots. They embody deeply moving human vestiges of the ultimate moments in a Zen master's life. The final dark ink traces from the shaky hand of the Japanese Zen pioneer Enni Ben'en (1202-1280) have been treasured for more than seven hundred years at Tbfukuji in Kybto (Fig. 75). They dramatically reflect the dying master's energetic effort for countenance, when he summarized his religious insights in the following words: 108 218 McRae: op. cit.

The old [abbot of] Tbfuku/ji]. Farewell, chinchb!223 One of the most moving written Zen documents altogether was left behind by his disciple and successor on the abbot's chair of Tbfukuji in the ninth generation. It is the death gatha of the eighty-four year old Chikotsu Dai'e (1 229-1 31 2) at Ganjbji in Kybto (No. 36). His words sound admonishing and encouraging, but his hand is barely able to follow his spirit and the rules of writing. With iron willpower and summoning his last force, he brought to paper his spiritual testament while facing death: Surpass yourselves up to the Highest in the means [to be used for salvation], hbben ! Advance the [inner] self-realization [of truth], jishb, and the natural spontaneity, jinen ! Adapt yourselves obediently to the things in this world! Eighty-four year old Dai'e (ka'o, "paraph"). On the 22nd day of the eleventh month in the first year of the Shbwa [era, 1312]. The vertical lines waver, and the individual characters tilt now to the right, now to the left, staggering alarmingly. Already in the first line, the pattern of four characters per line is interrupted abruptly: there was no more space for the fundamental Buddhist term hbben, in Sanskrit upaya, epitomizing the means and methods for salvation. Moreover, the brush dropped off downwards, and the second character of the compound lies at a dizzy angle almost on its side at the top of the second column. The first line, precariously fluttering to the left, thus has only three characters, while the second one has five. Gathering all his physical and spiritual strength, the master has his exhausted hand drag the bristly brush across the paper, painfully adding one character after another. The hand slips, and some parts of the characters turn into rough scratches, loops, and stains. Dramatically, they show the dying master's heroic struggle for composure at the moment his life is coming inexorably to its end. Posthumously he was honoured with the title ButtsG Zenji, "Master of Meditation of the Buddha Permeation". Also associated chiefly with Tbfukuji was Daidb lchi'i (1292-1370), a native of Awaji Island. He came to the capital, studied under Kokan Shiren (1 278-1346) and eventually was appointed to the most prestigious positions in Kybto's monastic society: 28th abbot of Tbfukuji and 31 st of Nanzenji. Daidb lchi'i was renowned not only for his eminence in religious matters, but also for his scholarly accomplishments and literary talents as one of the leading gozan literati of his days. The Komyo'in of Tbfukuji owns his striking depart- 109</page><page sequence="105">ing verse (Fig. 76).224 There is no order and stability to the lines any more and the char- acters are structureless to the degree of illegibility. Most of them tumble loosely around tilting toward the left, as if they were blown by a thunderous storm. The writer's hand seems totally exhausted so that the uncontrolled movements of the brush are only able to produce scratchy and shaky flourishes that can hardly be identified as characters. These last messy "ink traces" of Daidb Ichi'i unmistakably convey the agony of death: A single song of non-birth, mushb,225 Fills the void, koku, with its harmony. "Sunny Spring and White Snow". "Green Clouds and Pure Wind". Daidc Ichi'i (ka'o, "paraph") [wrote this] on the 26th day of the second month in the third year of the O'an [era, 1370]. In his final thoughts the literatus and master of meditation evokes some famous lines of classical Chinese poetry. The picturesque image of "Sunny Spring and White Snow" had been already popular in aristocratic circles of the Chu Empire since the third century B.C. It was recorded by Xiao Tong (501 -531) in his "Selections of Refined Literature", Wen- xuan, and the Yuan poet Yang Chaoying (ca.1270-1352?) chose the immortal theme of Yangchun baixue as title for his anthology of qu, free arias or lyric verses.226 The grace- ful phrase of "Green Clouds and Pure Wind", biyun qingfeng, appears in the third line of a poem by the Dharma master Yuquan Puming, that has been recorded in the sixth chap- ter of Xutang Zhiyu's (1185-1269) collected sayings.227 Many masters of meditation reached the high age of seventy to eighty years. The major- ity of them parted upright in seated meditation posture, in quiet composure to the last breath. The passing of a Zen master was a ritualized solemn event within the monastic community. Due to a crippled left leg the great Daitokuji abbot Shuho Myocho (1282- 1337), better known under his honorary title Daitb Kokushi, had been unable to practice zazen in the full-lotus seat most of his life. When he felt on the verge of final parting, he wrenched both legs into the proper seated mediation posture and broke his left leg at the knee. Daitb's determination to die in conformance with his eminent predecessors was certainly inspired by the Zen ideal of spiritual lineage. Before passing away he picked up the brush and wrote with surprisingly firm hand his yuige which has been kept with high esteem at Daitokuji ever since: I have severed Buddhas and patriarchs. My "blown-hair [sword]" was constantly honed. Where the wheel of moving power [of the universe] revolves, Even the void, kokui, gnashes its teeth.

(1983), p. 666a, and Hoffmann: op. cit., pp. 11Of. The first line is a quotation from the 25th chapter of the "Blue Cliff Record", Biyanlu, and indicates together with the seond line - one of the master's favourite phrases - the discarding of the body, the total freedom from worldly attachment, and the tran- scendence of death by becoming one with it. The last line of the stanza is supposed to imitate the sound effect of a drum and a shouting encourage- ment to aid effort; written with a different initial character it can be also read h6hachi (hc5hatsu) rasatsu, and may be traced back to the middle chapter of the Wuzu Fayan Chanshi yulu. See Shinpan Zengaku daijiten, pp. 894b, 119b-c, and 1140c. The "blown-hair sword" of the second line is an allusion to a legendary weapon that would cut a thin hair blown by the wind against its razor-sharp blade. It is a metaphor for the irresistible sharpness of the enlightened mind cutting aside even Buddhas and patri- archs. The allegory of the "blown-hair sword" also occurs in Linji Yixuan's (died 867) departing verse which certainly was familiar to Daitb. The closing line of Linji's stanza reads: "After the 'blown-hair sword' has been used, it must be quickly honed".229 At the edge of transition from this world into another realm of existence, symbolized by the revolving wheel, even the void gnashes its teeth in the face of the master's intrepid stead- fastness and self-assurance. "Daitb himself, teeth clenching in pain, is none other than emptiness. At the same time, death is about to swallow the master whole, and yet death may be gnashing its teeth in defeat if Daitb is truly free of fear and attachment. [...] For Daitb's heirs at least, this scroll is a crowning emblem of Daitb's eloquent Zen, in which death is transmuted not only through insight but also through poetry and calligraphy."230 His older Chinese confrere Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339), serving in Kybto at that time as 23rd abbot of Kenninji and 14th of Nanzenji, is said to have been deeply impressed by Daitb's death poem. Qingzhuo's own departing verse has been preserved at the Tokiwayama Bunko in Kamakura (Fig. 77) 231 The Chinese prelate must have had forebodings of his approaching death when he celebrated a solemn "retirement high mass", tsui'en jfdc, at Nanzenji on the 17th day of the twelfth month in the first year of the Ryakuo era, i.e. January 27, 1339, and subsequently retired to Zenkb'an at Kenninji: exactly one month later, he died at the age of 65. The tradition concerning his yuige adds a dramatic note to its creation: when a disciple who had not been able to see his mas- ter alive knelt in tears at Qingzhuo's deathbed, the master is said to have opened his eyes once more and to have written the penetrating farewell lines in which he gave expression to his feelings at the threshold between life and death, in the void of the universe, birankO,232 between the waters of the seas and the stars of the firmament. Due to this miraculous event, the testament of Qingzhuo Zhengcheng is referred to in literature as kanwari no bokuseki, "ink traces from the split coffin [or corpse]". Upholding the conventions of his religious heritage and his cultural milieu Muso Soseki (1 275-1351) left behind a departing verse that abounds with literary allusions. The terse- ness of the language bespeaks the master's concentration and mental clarity. He com- posed his yuige on the 29th day of the ninth month in the year 1351. The following day he died in his seventy-seventh year. He was buried at Sane'in of Rinsenji in Kybto. His death poem is recorded in chapter 2 of his collected sayings, Musi Kokushi goroku, the preface of which is dated 1354: Turning the body round all the way, tenshin no ichiro, I erase [my traces] in time and space, ogai jumatsu. What will be the outcome of it? Ponparbsa [the sound of a drum]!233 111</page><page sequence="107">The last ink traces from the brush of his favourite disciple Shun'oku Myoha (1311 -1388) have been preserved at Rokuo'in in Kyoto. Here again we are confronted with the painful aspects of death: In more than seventy years of illusory existence, / have completed the earlier masters' unfinished destiny After having collected the gold in the whole country I leave now. Old sails are hoisted side by side on my boat. The old Shun'oku [wrote this] on the eleventh day of the eighth month in the second year of the Kakei [era, 1388] (ka'o, "paraph").234 The next day he died in his seventy-eighth year. Although Shun'oku Myoha prepared his yuige in advance it mirrors at least visually in its unbalanced spacing, the uncontrollable slanting of the lines, the exhausted rough weakness and fragility of each single charac- ter the final phase of the writer's life. His younger confrere Zekkai Chushin (1336-1405), prominent figure in the gozan literary movement and extremely versed in Chinese poetry even by continental standards, was yet another successful disciple of Muso Soseki. He led a nearly hermitic existence and was by far not as tactful, sociable and politically sensitive as his master. In his final poem he first expressed the agonizing emotions of death, but in the last line also the sover- eignty of his spiritual breakthrough into the realm of ultimate enlightenment: The void, kokO, falls to the ground, And the "fire star" [Mars], kasei, hovers in chaos. [The universe] is upside down and tumbling over. / have straightened and passed through the iron enclosure.235 Such departing verses, written in the face of death, belong among the most moving handwritten testaments in human history. These are not works of art aspiring to a har- mony of form and content. These last ink traces of the brush do not allow any aesthetic experience of art anymore, and the sensitive viewer cannot fail to be shaken and taken aback by them. They speak not of a play with brush and ink, but of the agonizing struggle with death. Of exclusive importance in these documents is the religious message of the writer, often transformed into Chinese characters with a last, almost super-human effort. Yuige are thus imbued with an aura of sacrosanctity from the moment of their inception. In simile-like poetic form, and usually in a few lines, the masters of meditation epitomized the sum of their teachings and experiences at the end of their lives to transmit them to their successors and disciples. "A departing verse was not simply intended to testify to the master's enlightenment; is was producing it and contained, in the literal sense, its 'essence'. As such, it was also a relic 'embodying' ultimate truth, and it sometimes com- peted with other Chan regalia used in the transmission of the Dharma such as the robe or the chinz6.

Fig. 78 Portrait of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323), early 14th century. Detail. Senbutsuji, Kyoto (No. 25). In Japan, the sumptuous decoration of cultic spaces and sanctuaries was part of the essential functions of Buddhist sacred art. Shogon, "sanctification by ornamental splen- dour", has been one of the most distinguished tasks of religious images: unfolding the celestial beauty of the saviour figures and their numinous spheres in front of the believer's eyes and thus eliciting the sacred essence in their hearts. As ritual cult image, a Buddhist painting can become the focal point of sacred veneration and worship; it can be the base for the access to transcendence, or assume the role of precious sacrificial or votive offer- ing. Except for portrait statues of eminent masters and the relatively few sculptures of Buddhist saviour figures in a Zen monastery, Zen art hardly ever assumes the function of establishing contact between worshiper and worshiped deity by magically evoking a tan- gible presence of the deity. Rather, its functions are limited to a few fundamental aspects: it may serve as a memorial effigy, as an admonishing image or a stimulating redemptive picture, as a document of spiritual or friendly ties, as a certificate of inheritance or seal of transmission, as a symbol of ethic-moral values, or generally as an expression of Zen Buddhist ideology. A religious school emphasizing the lives and characters of its religious founders and its outstanding patriarchs, as well as the authentic doctrine transmitted from mind to mind in uninterrupted sequence from its very beginnings is bound to celebrate the decisive events in the lives of its grand paragons, especially birthdays and anniversaries of death. Nevertheless, the liberal Zen school could not entirely escape a certain ritualization of these events. The Zen communities, as, for that matter, most other Buddhist schools, celebrate the birthday of Sakyamuni on the eighth day of the fourth month, while observ- ing his "entry into nirva-na" on the 15th day of the second month with the nehan'e or nehanki, the "nirva-na assembly". The death of its protagonists is commemorated in so- called nenki on the 1st, 3rd, 13th, 17th, 23rd, 25th, 27th, 33rd, 37th, 50th, 75th, and 100th anniversary. In the case of Buddha Sakyamuni, the third ceremonial occasion of highest rank in the ecclesiastical year, after birthday and day of death, is the eighth day of the last month, rbhachi or rbhatsu, the day on which Sakyamuni attained Enlightenment at the sight of the morning star. In Zen monasteries, this supreme saving event is celebrated by a seven days' meditation session, zazen, for which the monks assemble in the Meditation Hall, zendb or sodd, every day from 3:30 in the morning until 21:30 in the evening. This period, during which the monks are released from all routine work and regular administrative duties, is called rbhachi sesshin, which could be trans- lated as "concentrating one's thoughts on the eighth [day] of the last [month]". It begins on the first day of the twelfth month and ends in the early morning hours of the eighth day by the assembly reciting the hymn of "Great Compassion", daihi, in front of an image of "Sakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains", Shussan Shaka. The core of the cere- monies is a kind of "high mass" with a sermon by the abbot, known in Zen circles as rdhachi jodd.237 On the occasion of this day, the painter-monks of the great monasteries would often paint Shussan Shaka images, or inscribe already existing ones. Other monks would write poems, often with a tinge of disappointment about their continuing failure to attain 1 15</page><page sequence="110">enlightenment despite the most intense efforts, adding that an inner spark of hope, how- ever, continued to glow and would have to be fanned into a flaming fire. Thus, Jakushitsu Genkb (1290-1367) composed the following verse, entitled "Snow on rbhatsu": This is the morning that Sakyamuni became Buddha, And here this disaster has befallen man and heaven! Let's go find a spark of fire, Burn some dry kindling, watch the snow, and sleep.238 The fifth day of the tenth month is dedicated to the memory of the first Chan patriarch in China, Bodhidharma. On this day, portraits and paintings showing scenes from his life and career adorn the halls of Zen monasteries. In his honour, an incense sacrifice, nenkb, is offered as the main part of the liturgy. A eulogy written between 1264 and 1269 on Mt. Jing by Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269), the abbot of the Wanshou Monastery, is extant at Daitokuji in Kyoto.239 Portraits of patriarchs representing especially cyclically succeeding generations of Zen Buddhist founding fathers, eminent masters of a school or renowned abbots of a monastery act as quasi timeless carriers of tradition and remind the Zen community of their spiritual and ecclesiastical heritage. They are memorial and worship images, hung in the Founder's Hall, kaisandb, or above the altar of the Dharma or Lecture Hall, hattb, during memorial ceremonies, such as the kaisanki, "memorial service [on the death anniversary] of the mountain opener". In China special structures for ancestral portraits were erected already in Sui and Tang times: they were usually called zutang, "Patriarchs' Halls", or zhentang, "Likeness Halls", dedicated to the veneration of important patriarchs and prelates in the meditation school's lineage. They continued to play a pivotal role dur- ing the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In 1070 the Chan abbot Baiyun Shouduan (1025-1072) complained about the increasing neglect of the early patriarchs' images in favor of for- mer abbots' portraits in his "Preface to the Rules for the Patriarch Hall", Zutang gangli xu: "[...] but, alas, in patriarch halls throughout the empire the founding abbots and their suc- cessors are regarded as the [principal] patriarchs".240 Little more than three decades later he was quoted by the Chan historian and poet-monk Juefan Huihong (1071 -1128) in the first chapter of his "Record of the Forest's Spaces", Linjian lu, published 1107, as saying: It is due to the power of Chan Master [Baizhang Huaihai, 749-814] Dazhi that monas- teries flourish in the land. In the patriarch hall, an image of the first patriarch Bodhidharma should be set up in the center, an image of the Chan Master Dazhi should face west, and images of the founding abbot and other venerables fi. e., former abbots] should face east. Do not set up the images of the founding abbot and venerables alone, leaving out the patriarchal line.241 Baiyun Shouduan's rules, though lost except for their often cited preface, seem to have set a certain standard in Chan public monasteries for the order and display of portrait cycles of masters in successive generations. There is evidence, however, that the orien- tation of images in a larger series was also determined by the position, the portrayed sub- ject occupied in the patriarchal lineage. Facing such portraits properly installed in a Patri- arch's Hall, the masters of odd-numbered generations were lined up to the viewer's right looking toward the left (i.e., west) and masters in all even-numbered generations were lined up to the left facing right (i.e., east).242 Zen portraits painted during the lifetime or shortly after the death of a Zen master - often during the 49 days of official mourning - while the impression of his personality was still fresh, also fulfilled the function of memorial paintings. They were carried along during the funeral, sbgi or sbshiki, and during mourning processions, and took a central place in the annual memorial ceremony, shuki, in honour of the Zen master in question. The ceremo- nial function of such portraits is referred to by the term shin gi, used exclusively for this type of effigy and meaning literally "true cult [image]", gi on its own meaning "ceremony, cult, or ritual". Kashin or keshin, "to hang up the true [likeness]" of a deceased master above the altar after his coffin, gan, had been transferred from the Abbot's Quarters to the Lecture Hall, was one important act in the Zen funerary ritual.243 The significance of portraits in this context is vouched for by the "Pure Rules of the Garden of Meditation", 11 6 238 Pollack: op. cit., p. 33; cf. also the poems about rdhachi by Wuxue Zuyuan (Jap.

Once we abandon this fiction, we are forced to reject the corollary claims that the 'intimacy' of the verse inscription, the 'naturalism' of the portrait, or any other stylistic feature of the 'chinzci genre' can be derived from their function as transmission certificates." 249 See Nishiyama and Stevens: op. cit., Vol. 2, pp. 178-186. Chanyuan qinggui, dated 1103. This influential monastic code instructs the spiritual heirs of the deceased master of meditation in considerable detail: When three days have passed [following the death of the abbot] put the body in the cas- ket following the same procedure as that used for [ordinary] deceased monks. When putting the body in the casket, invite a venerable elder to carry the "spirit seat" lingzuo. At this time dharma verses are recited [by the elder]. Place the casket on the west side of the Dharma Hall and on the east side set up a cot and robe rack with the personal implements [belonging to the deceased]. Hang the portrait, zhen [of the deceased] on the dharma seat [in the center of the hall]. A ritual site for the ceremony should be pre- pared in the Dharma Hall with a plain curtain, white flowers, a lamp and candle set, and offerings placed in front of the portrait. The disciples remain behind the casket screen at the foot of the banners in their mourning robes and guard the casket.244 The funerary services in honour of a deceased Zen prelate focused just as much on his likeness as on his dead body. Prayers, prostrations, food, tea, and incense offerings were made to the portrait for the explicit purpose to "raise the enlightened spirit to a more exalted status".245 When the monastic congregation of Nanzenji in Kyoto celebrated the third death anniversary of the revered Chinese Zen master Yishan Yining (1 247-1317) with a solemn "high mass", the participating ex-Emperor Go Uda (1267-1324) himself wrote a eulogy on the abbot's portrait used in the ceremony.246 While the Chinese prelate was still alive, the Emperor, who had abdicated his throne in 1287, bestowed upon him favours, veneration, and unlimited confidence. The entrance of a new Zen adept into the monastery was celebrated not so much by a "mass" as by a private initiation ceremony in the most intimate circle of congenial friends. For such an event, too, portraits of celebrated Zen masters might be displayed. Of the Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimitsu (1358-1408), we know that upon his entrance into the monks' community in 1395, he received the tonsure, teihatsu, seated in front of a por- trait of the reputed, politically extremely influential founding abbot of Tenryuji, Muso Soseki (1275-1351), and encouraged participating friends, nobles, and military leaders to follow his example (No. 29, Fig. 79).247 Chinzb or portraits painted prior to the depicted master's death fulfill a double task. On the one hand, an effigy of the prelate carrying a dedication from his own brush was for the Zen disciple a visible testimony of his spiritual ties, a Zen auxiliary occasionally hung by the follower on the walls of his monastery and allowing him thus to communicate with his model even in the latter's absence. On the other hand, however, the portrait of a Zen master in the hands of one of his followers was tangible evidence for the authentic suc- cession of the doctrine. In that case, the portrait assumed the symbolic function of a "seal of competence", inka, a certificate of achieved mastery.248 The great importance of "seals of transmission" or "documents of inheritance" has been attested at great length by Dbgen Kigen (1200- 1253) in the 64th chapter of his Shobbgenzb, "Eye-Treasury of the True Dharma"; it is entitled Shisho, "Certificate of Inheritance".249 Summarizing his expe- riences and observations in Song Chinese Chan monasteries, he expounds the principal idea of a "seal of transmission", reports on the careful handling and safekeeping of such certificates of inheritance, and laments their frequent abuses by ambitious monks: Obtaining the seal of Buddha transmitting Buddha should be used to clarify the move- ment of the sun, moon, and stars and the attainment of skin, flesh, bones, and marrow. Sometimes a kesa, sometimes a staff, sometimes a pine branch, sometimes a fly whisk, sometimes an udumbara flower, sometimes a golden robe, sometimes a straw sandal, and sometimes a shippei is used to transmit the Dharma. [..] When the transmission occurs, the seal is made with blood from either a finger or tongue. It may be written with oil or milk. Either is acceptable. Both transmitter and receiver form the Buddhist transmission. [...]. There are some priests of large temples of the Kosetsu District who are said to trans- mit the lives of Rinzai, UJmmon, and Tbzan. However, many self-proclaimed descendants of Rinzai are self-centered and dishonest. They study under a renowned master and then ask for his portrait or a sample of his calligraphy. This is what they use as their standard transmission. Worse than that, there are some priests, no better than dogs, who visit 117</page><page sequence="112">I~~( ,'N'. -,' '': 74~ ~~~~~~~~~~. many different masters and ask for a portrait or a sample of calligraphy Like this, they acquire a large stock of such things. As they get older they bribe officials in order to receive support for establishing a new temple and then become abbot, even though they have not received a seal of transmission from a true master. [. .] It is disgraceful that such malicious deeds occur in this evil age. [..] Generally, samples of one's calligraphy or one's portrait are freely given to scholars, lay people, junior priests, merchants, etc. This can be seen in any of the annals of the various schools.250 After all, certificates of the true Dharma transmission were legal documents and spiritual credentials in the hands of those monks who would aspire to an appointment for the abbot's chair in a public officially recognized Chan monastery.

Detail. Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka (No. 62). Zen Buddhism claims "a special transmission outside traditional doctrines", aims at the absolute nil, the void beyond all form and colour, and renounces almost completely any display of cultic splendour. Its painting was thus bound to diverge from the representa- tional conventions of orthodox Mahayana art, following different creative principles, and using other pictorial means. Zen painting itself never depicted its highest religious beings, Buddha and the Bodhisattvas, in a demonstration of numinous power and sumptuous- ness or in other-worldly rapture, and it could therefore renounce two essential represen- tative principles of traditional Buddhist sacred painting: first, the indication of various spheres of existence, from the highest, intangible Buddha sphere in its heavenly harmony and desensualized abstraction down to the earthly human sphere; and second, the scale of significance which differentiates the figures according to their religious rank and com- positional dominance. The holy figures of Zen always remain on the solid ground of human, worldly life experience; even in idealizing spiritualization or heroic enhancement, they keep to a large extent the measure of mortal companions accessible to this-worldly, concrete-empirical imagination. The figures molded and permeated by the spirit of Zen are - aside from some exceptions - of historical dimensions. Generally, it is safe to say that Zen painting proceeds from the existing and ordinary, that it emphasizes biographi- cal details and integrates anecdotal-legendary events as easily as everyday-common- place aspects. Yet, Zen painting does not attempt to give an inventory survey corre- sponding exactly to visual appearance by using realistic, illusionistic means. Only the portraits of masters of meditation, the chinzd done from life, endeavor to render palp- able, by as high a degree of verisimilitude as possible, the spiritual presence of the per- sonality beyond space and time. In this instance, Zen painting, too, follows relatively strict rules, determining even the arrangement of the inscription according to the line of sight of the portrait's subject, a convention which marked a large part of Zen Buddhist figure painting. In all other respects, however, Zen painting is relatively free from rules, systems, and prin- ciples. Concepts such as asymmetry, plainness, and artlessness were already mentioned in the chapter concerning attitude of Zen toward the arts. Axiality, parallelism, frontality, and everything subject to symmetry are abandoned in favour of seemingly accidental equilibrium and rhythmical coherence which in fact, however, are due to a somnambulist confidence and pictorial command. The depicted objects join each other naturally, not in accordance with any rationally calculated compositional formula or regulatory principle, but obeying an inner logic and necessity. This results often in latent tensions, such as between painted and bare surface, between line and wash, between light and dark, between object and space. Zen painting has succeeded in condensing its subject mat- ter to the essential minimum without, however, reducing the degree of reality achieved; it eliminates all ornamentation detracting from the core of the artistic message. In this process of concentration, colours become subordinate and often discarded altogether. Aside from portrait painting, in which the Zen abbots are shown in resplendent, richly- coloured vestments, colours can be seen to a certain extent in representations of Arhats. Sakyamuni and Bodhidharma often appear in a plain, red monk's robe. 121</page><page sequence="115">The foundation of Zen painting, however, is monochrome ink painting. It answers best the demand of Zen painting for spontaneous, individual expression, for meditative immer- sion, for simplicity, and ultimately for all-encompassing void. During its most flourishing period, Zen Buddhist ink painting could rely on well-tried techniques of Chinese secular painting, some of which had matured for centuries. Ink painting using mostly expansive washes, boku'un, or broadly applied strokes, renouncing on purpose well-defined con- tour lines, was called mogufa in Chinese, "boneless manner", mokkotsuhd in Japanese. The contour is defined by the edge of the wash, rinkakusen. The use of "broken ink", porno or haboku, allowing undreamed possibilities of individual, emotional artistic ex- pression by wet application of the ink in graded washes beyond firm contours and colours, can probably be traced back to Wang Wei (699-759), the model figure of literati painting. It would seem, however, that the full use of the potential of aesthetic expression inherent in this new technique of "broken ink" was reserved for the painters of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), who enjoyed the highest adulation in the Zen circles of Japan and China. At about the same time that broken ink technique originated, toward the end of the sev- enth and the beginning of the eighth century, another technique - accidentally with the same pronunciation, but written with different characters - was invented: porno or hatsu- boku, "splashed ink", a way of painting considered to be eccentric already at that time (Fig. 80). Indeed, its artistic appeal was largely due to the rigorously anti-traditional inner freedom of the artists practising it, to their random, playful handling of brush and ink, as well as to the naturally occurring accidental effects. Chinese art theory soon coined the term moxi, literally "ink play", Japanese bokugi, for this style. Classic examples of such radical abbreviation are the sections of the two extremely sparse versions of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang", in Japanese Shdshd Hakkei, extant in Japan and attributed to the Song masters Muqi and Yujian (Figs. 81 -83).251 In Japan, the tradition was con- tinued by such painter-monks as Tbshun (active first half 16th century) and Sesson Shukei (ca.1504-ca.1589), who used this ink technique, so congenial to the free Zen spirit, to create enchanting interpretations of the eight scenic spots along the rivers Xiao and Xiang (Nos. 61 -62). Similar tendencies could be seen in the art of writing. Around the middle of the eighth century, the style reached its first peak with the impetuous creations of the "crazy monk" Huaisu (737-after 798) who is said to have practised his writing on banana leaves, wooden boards, clothes, and walls when drunk. Significantly, his idiosyncratic style influ- enced not only the unconventional Song literati in China, but had great appeal among Chinese and Japanese Zen monks ever since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The free, cursive brush flow of Yishan Yining (1247-1317), for example, can be traced to this source ultimately (No. 37). To the painter, too, the seemingly haphazard handling of brush and ink opened up the possibility of immediate and unconstrained artistic expression; using it, he could give his momentary feelings visible shape. The emphasis is on "writing down the [instantaneous] idea", xieyi, as the Chinese say, whereby an exact rendering of the objects, i.e., the striv- ing for formal similitude, entirely recedes behind the personal expressive values of the artist's "handwriting". By the dynamic, rough handling of the brush and the intentionally coarse use of the ink, the ink painter creates an effect extremely popular in unconven- tional Zen Buddhist painting; caused by the spreading of the brush's hairs when they "fly over" the surface and leave white streaks in the black stroke, the effect is aptly called "overflown white", feibai in Chinese or hihaku in Japanese. A markedly fleeting, temporal aspect characterizes the execution of such strokes. To achieve such broken, gnarled brushwork, painters as well as calligraphers liked to use old, ravaged "dry brushes", kebi or kappitsu, or plain, rough "rice straw brushes", warafude (Fig. 3). An especially good example of this often tempestuous use of the brush is a pair of scrolls in the Tokyo National Museum entitled N/so chdshin, "Two [Zen] Patriarchs Harmonizing Their Minds" (No. 10, Fig. 84). A short inscription names Shi Ke (died after 975) as painter and dates the paintings to 963. However, the scrolls are most likely copies of lost origi- nals or works of the thirteenth century in Shi Ke's style, originally belonging to a hand- scroll.252 122 Fig. 81 Wild Geese Descending to Sandbar from "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang" by Muqi (active mid- 13th century).

The robes, however, he executed in rough brushstrokes. This statement of Tang Hou's, a connoisseur who probably had the opportunity to see original paintings by Shi Ke during the early Yuan Dynasty, is exactly in keeping with the style of the two scrolls at the Tokyo National Museum. The cowering figure of a bald old monk, immersed in deep meditation, and supporting himself with his right arm on the back of a peacefully sleeping tiger, is no doubt the legendary Fenggan. This eccentric Chan master is said to have lived at Guoqingsi on Tiantaishan during the Tang Dynasty. He was extremely close to a tiger and later painters always depicted him with his tiger. The fur of the tiger is lightly dabbed with a worn, almost dry brush. Together with the dark stripes, this creates an extremely accurate surface characterization which clearly differentiates the textures of contrasting parts of the painting despite the seem- ingly confusing compression. The other patriarch, meditating with his eyes closed, the bearded chin of his sideways inclined head resting in his right hand, is depicted with his torso bare. Possibly, he is the second Zen Patriarch Huike (487-593), whose biography refers to the "harmonizing of the mind" mentioned in the title. The most striking charac- teristic of these two figure paintings is the broad, jet-black brushwork of the robes' con- tours. Inside these splinteringly brittle, arhythmical, broken ink strokes, a graded ink wash indicates the robes' surface and lends the bodies of the meditating monks volume and tangible substance. Within the wide range of pictorial elements and forces, the line holds the most august position. The classical secular and religious painting of East Asia is based on a neutral, detached, line vocabulary free of personal expression. Here, the line does not carry any expressive value of its own. It is even, thin, precise, accurate; despite all its rhythmic- musical qualities and decorative-ornamental effects read into it, its predominating task is to separate surfaces from each other, and to define the surface it outlines as a given 124 Fig. 84 Patriarch Harmonizing his Mind on a Sleeping Tiger, in the style of Shi Ke (died after 975), probably 13th century.

This is achieved in its purest form in the so-called "linear painting on white", baimiao or hakuby6, a technique which renounces all colour. Its domain always remained figure painting, with the painter-poet, connoisseur of antiquity, and court offi- cial Li Gonglin (ca.1041-1106) its most important representative. For Zen Buddhist themes, however, it was hardly ever used. Nevertheless, the hanging scroll of the "Four Sleepers" at the Tokyo National Museum (Fig. 100)253 or the Shoso Monju painting of 1338 at Nanzenji in Kybto (No. 4, Fig. 85) show the sublime expressive potential inher- ent in pure line drawing for Zen themes as well. The Yuan painter-monk Jueji Yongzhong intensified the extremely sensitive and melodious line play of his Guanyin paintings to vir- tually ascetic simplicity. The few even lines, perfectly controlled in each phase, seem to have flowed from his brush in steady tempo and with somnambulistic assurance. They are akin to the graphic clarity and precision of a black and white woodcut or stone rub- bing. Void and line enter into serene, intimate dialogue, thus rendering the figures of the white-robed Avalokitegvara ethereal and dwelling in the empty space of a celestial sphere. The painter, who lived around 1300 at Huanzhu'an near Suzhou, was a disciple of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323). The latter wrote profound verses in his idiosyncratic handwriting on the scrolls of the standing Bodhisattva at the Fujita Bijutsukan, Osaka,254 and in the collection of Soshiro Yabumoto, Tokyo,255 as well as on the version of the seated Balyi Guanyin signed by the painter, at the Cleveland Museum of Art (No. 3, Fig. 86). In his inscription on the last work, he eulogizes the emptying of the mind by deep meditation, as well as the Bodhisattva's perfect harmony attained by mystic means and his all-encompassing compassion satiating infinite time and space. The right thinking [Samkalpa] is embodied within His deep meditation on the Buddha [naga-samadhi]. Retaining not even one single object of thought, A perfect harmony was wonderfully achieved. In the endless time and space, His all-embracing compassion prevails. [signed] Ming-pen [Mingben] of Huan-chu [Huanzhu] paying his respects.256 The counterpart to the austere, permanently even, de-materialized line of the "painting on white" is the lively, expressive, dynamically modulated ink line (Figs. 2, 88, 91). It is by any standard the most important element of Zen Buddhist painting, especially in the case of figure painting. It takes its vitality from the flexible modulation of its thickness which lends it not only a certain independent two-dimensionality, but at the same time allows it, thanks to its shading and modelling capacity, to render the depicted form with bodily substance and sculptural volume. Moreover, the changing thickness of the line and the gradation of ink tones immanent in the brush flow allows the creation of gradual transi- U1 ".V Zi4 *1 . 0.1~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2</page><page sequence="119">tions between line and surface, between light and dark, between object and empty ground, between body and space; in this dialectic interrelation, the ink line acquires a wide open expressive potential congenial with the essence of Zen and overcomes any unilateral definition and predetermined finality. The flowing ink line, ultimately submitting to a canon independent of the object it depicts, does not obscure the process of its cre- ation; it allows the viewer to reenact this process and thus grants him access to the fleet- ing, but simultaneously timeless act of creation. The painter Liang Kai, active at the Imperial Academy during the first half of the thirteenth century, entertained close relations with the Chan clergy of Hangzhou and adopted a number of Zen Buddhist themes in his stylistically extremely varied oeuvre. His name is inextricably connected with an abbreviating artistic idiom called jianbi in Chinese and genpitsu in Japanese (Figs. 13, 87). This spontaneous technique of the "diminishing brushworkk" strives to bring a predetermined concept to paper in as concentrated a con- version as possible and thus corresponds, in its intensity and purity, entirely with the essence of meditative Buddhism. A poem from the anthology of the Chan master Beijian Jujian (1164-1246), who was most likely on close terms with the court painter, begins with a sentence that characterizes the jianbi technique: Liang Kai uses his ink but sparingly, as if it were gold; but when he is getting inebriated, the ink gets ever more condensed into dripping wet [ink traces], no matter if he adds his own sounds to this celestial music or if he remains silent. [.7]257 According to the title, the poem was given to "Liang, active at the palace in the service of His Majesty, as a present" by the 37th abbot of Jingcisi. Beside the extremely abbreviating brush technique, Zen Buddhist figure painting has been using a related stylistic idiom since the thirteenth century; its persuasive effect is based on the intimate relation between the figure suggested with gentle, pale gray ink lines and scant, jet-black accents contrasted with the empty ground. The ephemeral character of this technique is implied in the term wanglianghua, in Japanese mdrybga, meaning "ghostly painting" or "apparition painting",258 already used by the Song official and Confucian scholar Lou Yue (1137-1213). Lou Yue, who was friendly with a number of renowned Chan masters, saw the new style in the works of the painter-monk Zhirong (1114-1193). The latter seems to have lived at Lingyinsi, one of the great Chan monas- teries near Hangzhou; among other typical Zen subjects, he painted the "Oxherding" theme several times. In a poem entitled "Writing about Old Rong's Painting of the Ox Returning Home", Lou Yue lamented somewhat melancholically the ideal of untrammeled freedom of the independent mountain hermit: It has been six years since I departed from the old mountains To hold a low-ranking official position; The mountains only appear in my dreams. Why did I make an effort to bind myself to official cap and robe; While I envy the carefree oxen returning home?259 The Chan painter-monk Zhirong is said to have painted with such thin, watery ink that the object was hardly visible, appearing like a ghost and vanishing again into the wide open space of the painting's ground. Unfortunately, no originals by his hand are extant, but some pictures characterized by an extremely delicate and sensitive line vocabulary rendering the figures as fleeting and ephemeral apparitions may give an idea of such "ghostly painting": the Bodhisattva "Guanyin with a Willow Branch in His Hand and Standing on a Lotus Leaf" with an inscription by Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323),260 the Budai painting at the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, bearing the seals of the painter Zhiweng Ruojing (active mid-i18th century) as well as a poem written by Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263),261 and three scrolls with "Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed". Two of them are Song versions, one with a eulogy by the distinguished Chan prelate Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) (Fig. 90) and the other with an inscription by Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249). The third scroll at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (Fig. 89), has the seal and signature of Jitang Li Yaofu or Kido Rigyofu and an inscription by Yishan Yining (1 247-131 7).262 The hovering wanglianghua or mbrydga is one of the most 126 Fig. 86 White-robed Guanyin, by Jue]i Yongzhong (active around 1300), with an inscription by Zhong- feng Mingben (1263-1323).

"The transparent technique seems almost to express the percep- tion espoused by Ch'an Buddhism of existence as emptiness", writes Wen Fong,263 and Dietrich Seckel describes the ambivalent qualities of Zen painting in the following words: But this act of making visible and conscious these ontologically rooted limits of the phe- nomenal per se and thus indicating that this borderline can be crossed, constitute per- haps the most significant achievement of both pictures and viewers inspired to engage in a spiritual quest. The "sketchy" quality of Zen pictures is, therefore, something entirely different from the way Westerners understand this term; it is an abbreviation concen- trating on the innermost essence of things which we can only sense instinctively. It is also a self-limiting recognition of a borderline. But this recognition is inspired by the goal of crossing this threshold and doing so in a most radical sense. [... Just as Zen religious thought does not recognize any real dualism, these pictures, too, show the realm of the objects they depict as merging imperceptibly into that of the empty ground from which they emerge. They seem at times to re-merge into it like dreams and shadows, but this ground always manages to shine through their transparence. Here, too, a final limit is approached so that we may sense something that is infinite and beyond all antagonism.264 H.B. 129</page><page sequence="123">4. ~ ~ ~ ~ .

(1989), p. 232. Fig. 91 Laughing Budai, by Li Que (active mid- 13th century). Detail. Mybshinji, Kybto (No. 11). Beyond the religious-metaphysical ideology in which the real, given world becomes transparent to the point where the all-encompassing void can be experienced, the Zen artist often refers to quite real figures and events, relating his subjects directly to the Enlightened One himself, to his followers, to the way or the experience of enlightenment. The ideology and art theory of Zen were bound to have consequences: on the one hand, they led to the elimination of a large part of the orthodox Buddhist saviour figures in the traditional Mahayana pantheon; on the other hand, the older figures adopted by Zen, such as the historical Buddha Sakyamuni or the Bodhisattva Avalokitegvara, were sub- ject to a re-interpretation: they were demythologized and brought within the secular realm by making them into human-like models. Their artistic representation was changed from enraptured spiritualization and transcendental holiness with sumptuous, cultic-symbolic paraphernalia into secular-empirical aliveness of straightforward, familiar simplicity. This, as well as the introduction of new painting themes and types, resulted in a quite specific iconography in clear contrast to traditional sacred art, an iconography in which content and form of seemingly disparate things are brought into contact with each other, as we have seen already in the case of the classic Zen triptychs. Moreover, the shifts of emphasis and the innovations mentioned above were accompa- nied by a general re-evaluation of painting themes. While classic Buddhist cult painting was dominated by complex, intricately composed figure constellations, Zen art created, beside the still dominating figure paintings, other themes as well, especially paintings depicting nature. Indeed, nature plays an important part in Zen Buddhist painting. Whenever the figures, freed from all ornaments, are not standing or sitting in deep med- itation before - or maybe better in - the empty ground, they are depicted in intimate har- mony with nature, in understanding, loving unison with their environment, not as its rulers. "Nature is no longer mere background, stage prop or symbolic addition but, rather, is the essential element of the picture and an equal and on occasion even more intense basis for the interpretation of true reality than the sacred figures themselves."265 The nature, meaning, and content of some typical Zen paintings have been touched upon earlier. The following presentation of the main genres and themes of Zen painting shall deal with a number of additional, specifically iconographical questions. We shall follow the order used as a rule in the yulu or goroku, the "Recorded Sayings" of Zen masters, for the purpose of listing the painting inscriptions composed by them, since this sequence is evidently based on an iconographical evaluation. As a typical example, and at the same time as one of the earliest known sources for such a ranking, the list of paint- ings for which the Chan master Foyan Qingyuan (1067-1120) wrote poems is given here. It starts with "8akyamuni Emerging from the Mountains", Shussan Shaka; followed by Avalokitegvara (Guanyin/Kannon; in other goroku replaced by Arhats and Budai/Hotei); the "Three Saints of Mt. Tiantai", i.e., Hanshan/Kanzan, Shide/Jittoku, and Fenggan/ Bukan; the "Great Master Bodhidharma", and other historical Chan patriarchs. These poems, catalogued under the collective term fozuzan, "Inscriptions for [paintings of] Buddhist Forefathers", or zhenzan, "True Inscriptions", are usually followed by the mas- ter's dedicatory inscriptions on his portraits, so-called zizan (Jap. fisan). The final chap- 131</page><page sequence="125">ter of "Recorded Sayings" contains, among others, fisong or geju (gatha), "Laudatory and Didactic Poems", a varied category including inscribed paintings of seemingly secular subject matter, among which there might be allegoric pictures, such as the "Ten Oxherding" series, paintings of bamboo, orchids, or plum blossoms, bird and monkey paintings, as well as landscapes. Based on the hagiographical Zen literature, the fozu group allows an additional sub- grouping: zushitu or soshizu, "Paintings of the Historical Chan Patriarchs", and san- shengtu or sanseizu, "Paintings of Uncommitted Saintly Figures". The last category was especially popular in Zen painting. The main reason for this appeal is probably not so much the fact that a number of its most prominent representatives were considered to be avatjras, "descended traces", of central Buddhas and Bodhisattvas: Bukan as incar- nation of Amitabha, Hotei as the one of Maitreya, Kanzan as the one of Manjusri, and Jittoku as the one of Samantabhadra, to name but a few of the most important ones. Rather, these partly half-legendary "Saintly Figures" of uncertain rank within the Zen genealogy were models for the Zen adept because of their unfettered spiritual freedom, their unconventional life and behaviour, as well as their eccentric statements. 1. The Historical Buddha Sakyamuni The highest ideal of all Zen Buddhists, however, is the historical Buddha Sakyamuni. In the so-called zongpaitu or "Genealogy of the [Zen] School", he is represented in frontal view as the Tathagata bathed in the splendour of Enlightenment. He is seated in medita- tion in a round halo on a lotus pedestal with a flower in his right hand and the charac- teristic marks of his spiritual manifestation, the ur-m5 on the front and the usnisa on the head. Yet, in such Zen paintings he is not depicted as a metaphysical, idealized poten- tate beyond any spatial-temporal materialization, but as a historical initial link of a long chain of Zen Buddhist patriarchs. The posture with the flower is an unmistakable hint to the primal event of Zen ideology. Despite the hierarchic frontality of S5kyamuni, such rep- resentations thus contain a narrative-illustrative component and are not so much formu- laic cult images. A Chinese genealogy dating to the first half of the thirteenth century is extant at Tofukuji in Kyoto.266 Most likely it was given to the founder of that great Zen monastery, Enni Ben'en, by his teacher Wuzhun Shifan, during his sojourn on the conti- nent (1235-1241), since the sequence of Chan patriarchs, their names connected with fine, straight lines, ends with Wuzhun's and his Japanese master disciple's names. Ultimately, this continuous chain leads back to Sakyamuni via the early Chinese and Indian patriarchs indicated only summarily in numbers. Only Sakyamuni appears as an image and thus as the starting point of the complete genealogical system and the very origin of Zen. The Japanese painter-monk Kichizan Mincho (1351-1431) depicted the Supreme Being of Zen Buddhism similarly on the central image of a portrait series of seven horizontal hanging scrolls dated to 1426 at Rokub'in, Kyoto (Figs. 92, 107-108).267 For each of the thirty half figure portraits, the Zen abbot Gencho Shugaku (1359-1428) wrote a short biographical note reading toward the direction of the subject's line of sight. Each scroll shows five masters of meditation in three-quarter profile. The chain starts with 8akyamuni and ends with the renowned Japanese Zen abbots Muso Soseki (1275-1351) and his disciple Shun'oku Myoha (1311 -1388). 8akyamuni's role as earthly religion founder is emphasized even more in two other themes of Zen painting: 8akyamuni during his ascetic exercises in the struggle for Enlightenment, Kugy6 Shaka,268 and Sakyamuni's emergence from the mountains, Shussan Shaka, after subjecting himself to extreme asceticism in complete seclusion until he real- ized that this excessive self-castigation could not bring him nearer to his goal. Precisely these human characteristics of the historical Buddha made especially the second of the two themes one of the most popular painting subjects in Zen circles. The question as to whether the Shussan Shaka represents the Buddha having attained Enlightenment at the sight of the shining morning star or the ascetic saint weakened by hunger and cold can only be answered case by case, in accordance with numerous extant painting inscrip- tions.269 132 266 Zen no bijutsu - The Art of Zen Buddhism, No. 149, p. 205. 267 Brinker: op. cit.

Brinker: op. cit. (1995), pp. 488-495. Every Zen monk studying Sakyamuni's return from the mountains and about to compose a poem for a painting of that subject had to come to a new understanding of Buddha's Enlightenment as well as assess his own progress on the difficult road of this spiritual cleansing process. Ultimately, Zen considers every one-sided definition as a relapse into the confusion of logic-discursive thinking. Zen Buddhism knows no "either - or", but only "as well as". This completely open attitude toward the Shussan Shaka theme, inherent already in the neutral, dogma-free title "Sakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains", not "Appearance or Return of the Enlightened One" or such, is reflected in an extremely subtle poem of Yishan Yining (1247-1317) for a lost painting of this theme: To lead the Self out of the gate is easy. To emerge through the gate from the inside of the Self is difficult. In six years, [8clkyamuni] remained unchanged. [Like] the Big Dipper [ursa major] he faces south.270 This stanza can be found in the "Recorded Sayings" of Yishan Yining, who spent the last eighteen years of his life in Japan, propagating Zen and becoming one of the most influ- ential teachers of the school. Reputed to be an artistically gifted prelate, learned litera- tus, and renowned calligrapher, he was asked again and again by painters, commis- sioning parties, and owners to add inscriptions to paintings. Testament to his popularity in this respect are numerous extant scrolls bearing "ink traces" of his elegant brush,271 among others the "Bodhidharma Meditating on a Rock Plateau under a Pine Tree" at the Tokyo National Museum (Fig. 103), and the "Daruma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed" with the seal and signature of Jitang Li Yaofu or Kido Rigybfu at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (Fig. 89). The episode of "Sakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains" cannot be found in any of the older canonical Mahayana scriptures giving a detailed account of the historical Buddha's life and activity. Thus, in the classic Buddhist art of the Tang and pre-Tang periods it was represented neither in the biographical narrative pictures such as could be seen in the cave temples and the wall paintings of the great monasteries in China - the latter irre- trievably lost by the ravages of the tragic Buddhist persecution in 845 - nor in the tradi- 133</page><page sequence="127">tional painting series showing the "Eight Main Events" of Buddha's life, the Shaka hassb. The absence of such representations suggests that the idea of Sakyamuni's emergence from the mountains has its origin among the Chan Buddhists of post-Tang times attempt- ing the revitalization of Buddhism. The artists associated with these circles developed the theme into a most impressive and compelling painting concept during the tenth century. The uncontested masterpiece of the theme, and at the same time one of the oldest ver- sions extant, dates to the first half of the thirteenth century and is by the hand of the cel- ebrated academy painter Liang Kai (No. 1). Dietrich Seckel has called this painting "one of the most significant paintings of religious man in world art, both in its spiritual content and artistic form".272 It shows the historical Buddha at the mouth of a gorge between steeply towering rock walls as he is hesitating on his way out of the mountain solitude back into the the world. Inner concentration and deep earnestness permeate the ema- ciated figure of the grief-stricken ascetic standing barefoot on the snow-covered path. He has raised his hands to his naked chest; they remain hidden under the garment. The head is slightly inclined. A broad, firmly closed mouth, narrow, upwards-drawn eyes with long eyebrows, and a strikingly long nose characterize 8akyamuni as Indian. The unkempt hair and beard bespeak his long seclusion, and the thin bracelet on his right upper arm is an allusion to his aristocratic origin. The protuberance suggested on his head, as well as the exceedingly large ears are among the most important sacred phys- ical marks of Buddha. Unlike most Japanese painters, however, Liang Kai did not sur- round Sakyamuni's head with a halo. The work dates to Liang Kai's period at the Imperial Academy, since it is signed Yuqian tuhua Liang Kai, "Painted in the Service of His Majesty by Liang Kai". The Emperor Ningzong (reigned 1194-1224) was indeed known as patron and follower of meditative Buddhism. He institutionalized the alliance of the five most important Chan monasteries in Hangzhou and Mingzhou in Zhejiang Province into the "Five Mountains", wushan (Jap. gozan). Liang Kai may have created his Shussan Shaka painting under Ningzong or his successor, Lizong (reigned 1224-1264), but at any rate the wording of the signature indi- cates that he painted it while he was a member of the academy. Almost certainly, the painting is one of Liang Kai's mature, maybe even late masterpieces. Liang Kai's Shussan Shaka painting must have been brought to Japan soon after its cre- ation, at the latest during the fourteenth century - presumably by one of the numerous Chinese and Japanese pilgrim monks - as it is most likely identical with one listed in the collection of the Ashikaga Shbguns in connection with two landscapes. The painting was most inspiring to the Japanese and brought about a rich tradition of the genre in Japan. Thus the Zen monk and painter Yu'e Gukei active between 1361 and 1375, almost cer- tainly knew Liang Kai's painting, no doubt greatly admired in initiated circles, when he painted his version of the theme (Fig. 93).273 In contrast to this tradition after Liang Kai, which generally interpreted the theme of "Sakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains" literally by showing the Buddha figure in a more or less detailed mountain landscape, the painters working in monochrome ink con- centrated their efforts entirely on the representation of the figure. They either left out the landscape completely, or limited themselves to a strongly abbreviated rendering of a few elements. In works of this genre, a consciously unpretentious, spontaneous line suitable for the exclusive use of ink dominated the figures, in contrast to the academically pol- ished, often conservative or archaizing line of the other style. To this date the oldest known Chinese Shussan Shaka painting in monochrome ink was acquired by the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1970. The scroll bears an inscription dated to 1244 by the hand of the eminent Chan master Chijue Daochong (1170-1251): Since entering the mountain, too dried out and emaciated, Frosty cold over the snow, After having a twinkling of revelation with impassioned eyes Why then do you want to come back to the world?

In its plain overall concept, the painting resembles the oldest extant Japanese version of Shussan Shaka at the Seattle Art Museum, probably done after a Song model at the beginning of the thirteenth century at Kbzanji near Kybto (Fig. 94).275 The painting, hastily jotted down with jet-black ink and a relatively dry brush, bears two seals of Kbzanji, the famous Kegon monastery that was turned into one of the most important centers of reli- gious and artistic activity by the great reformer Myoe Shonin (1173-1232). Imported Chinese cult images, Buddhist paintings, book illustrations, iconographical drawings, and stone rubbings were copied in large numbers here, for the enhancement and dis- semination of Buddhist iconography across the country, regardless of the religious school a given painting might belong to. Myoe Shonin was a tolerant, highly educated abbot of manifold interests. Due to his friendship with Myoan Eisai (1141 -1215), who was edu- cated in China, brought the Rinzai school to Japan and founded the first Zen monaster- ies there, the abbot of Kozanji was quite familiar with Zen thought and practice. Thus it is hardly surprising that a number of typically Zen Buddhist paintings were created in this Kegon monastery, among them the Shussan Shaka ink sketch now at the Seattle Art Museum and several stylistically closely related images of Bodhisattva Avalokitetvara.276 The Shussan Shaka painting at Rikkyoku'an in Kyoto, too, shows a copy-like constraint and cautious confinement (No. 2). It bears an inscription by the Tbfukuji abbot Haku'un Egyo (1228-1298). As in his other commentaries concerning this central theme of Zen art, he ponders the question if Sakyamuni was right or wrong in his grave decision to return to the "profane world" out of pity and "compassion for the 'Three Existence Levels', sangai," of the unenlightened living beings. He reaches the conclusion that Buddha committed an error in this case.277 It is quite conceivable that Haku'un Egyo brought back with him, beside other memorial pieces and testaments to his ecclesiasti- cal connections and successes, a Song painting of "Sakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains". Such a painting might well have served as the basis for the version at Rikkyoku'an. If this conjecture is true, the Japanese work would have been painted between 1279 and 1298. In any case, it is probably the oldest Japanese version extant of the theme beside the Kbzanji drawing at the Seattle Art Museum. 2. Bodhisattvas Avalokitegvara is no doubt the most popular of all Bodhisattvas in the world of Zen. But like Sakyamuni, Avalokitegvara, the "Lord Looking Down [on the Suffering of the World]", as his Chinese name Guan(shi)yin, in Japanese Kannon (or Kanze'on), can be translated, does not appear with complex sacred paraphernalia in celestial, solemn loftiness when depicted in Zen art. Rather, the deity appears to those struggling for enlightenment, as a plain, merciful helper on the ground of secular reality. In the case of the Chinese, this ground was even on native soil since they developed from early times a theory accord- ing to which the residence of the Bodhisattva - Mt. Potalaka mentioned in the Ava- tamsaka SOtra, the Huayanjing or Kegonkyb - was situated on a small island off the coast of Ningpo in modern Zhejiang Province. The islet was called Putuoluojia or Butuoluojia (also Buculuojia) in Chinese transliteration; in Japanese the holy mountain was referred to as Fudaraku(sen) or Mt. Hotaraka.278 Thus, Kannon is usually represented in Zen art in relaxed pose seated on a rock amidst frothing waves, in a grotto, a bamboo grove or by a waterfall. An excellent ink painting on silk at Engakuji in Kamakura, traditionally attributed to Muqi, is characteristic for the un-hieratic stance of Zen artists.279 A version found less frequently is the Bodhisattva on a lotus leaf hovering above the waves. Although Zen painting does not completely renounce the frontal pose preferred by orthodox Buddhist painting for saviour figures on such exalted existence levels, the Bodhisattva is usually shown in decidedly informal three-quarter profile, often idly leaning on a rock or, in one case, - on one of the thirty- three Muromachi period hanging scrolls of the fifteenth century showing the miraculous manifestations of Kannon, at Kenchbji in Kamakura - while cooling his feet in the rush- ing waters of a mountain stream.280 Precisely in such voluminous painting sets, there was ample opportunity for unusual iconographical innovations and phantastically decorative details, especially since the type of the Potalaka Avalokitegvara developed on an illus- trative narrative basis. In such Kannon paintings, nature becomes an essential part of the 135</page><page sequence="129">painting and is mysteriously transfigured by the brightly shining presence of the Bodhisattva, often shown with the transparent halo around his head. Guanyin in a land- scape setting is said to have been depicted already by the Tang painter Zhou Fang (active ca. 780-810). The manifestation of Avalokitegvara shown most frequently in Zen painting is the one of PandaravasinT in a simple white robe, known in China as Balyi Guanyin and in Japan as Byaku'e Kannon. It is not quite clear when this type appears first. According to the Xuanhe huapu (chapters 2 and 3), the "Catalogue of the Imperial Painting Collection of the Xuanhe [era, 1119-1125]", dated to 1120 in the preface, the Song Emperor Huizong (1082-1135), himself an art connoisseur and talented painter, owned three early repre- sentations of the white-robed Bodhisattva: two dating to the first half of the tenth cen- tury by Du Zihuai and by Cao Zhongyuan, and a third dating to the eighth century by Xin Cheng, whose origin is unknown. Xin Cheng is said to have moved to the south-western cultural landscape of Shu, today's Sichuan Province, and to have made his name as painter of Buddhist figures. In his catalogue of famous painters in Sichuan, the Yizhou minghua lu (chapter 1), probably finished in 1106, Huang Xiufu reports that in 780, Xin Cheng was commissioned to execute large wall paintings for Dashengcisi, one of the great Buddhist monasteries in Chengdu. The influential Song literatus Li Gonglin (ca. 1041 -1106) seems to have painted the theme of the white-robed Avalokitegvara, too, although no originals by his hand are extant. A copy of one of his versions has come down to us in a stone engraving dated to 1132. Already during the second half of the twelfth century, the Balyi Guanyin, usually rendered in monochrome ink painting, seems to have been well known even in the circles of professional figure painters. On a painting in the series depicting "Five Hundred Arhats" originally consisting of one hundred scrolls painted between 1178 and 1188 for the Huianyuan, a cloister south-east of Ningpo, by the otherwise unknown artists Zhou Jichang and Lin Tinggui, five Arhats are admiring an ink painting showing Guanyin in a white robe (Fig. 95) 281 The Bodhisattva is seated on an overhanging rock plateau with a waterfall in the background. In relaxed posture, he leans sideways on a rock and rests his chin on his right hand. In the colourful surround- ings of the overall composition, this black and white ink painting stands out like an "exotic" element, and the Arhats, too, seem to consider the painting as such: they look at the scroll, in its fundamental concept no doubt a Chan work, with a certain surprise and amusement. The oldest extant independent paintings of Guanyin in a white robe date to the thirteenth century. The most important among them is by Muqi (Fig. 16).282 In its lower left, it bears the signature and the seal of the painter. The Guanyin picture is the central piece of the already mentioned triptych whose flanking scrolls depict a crane and a monkey mother with its young one, respectively. Owner seals on all three scrolls show that the triptych was once in the collection of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) and thus came to Japan at an early date. In the sixteenth century, the 25th Mybshinji abbot Taigen Sufu (died 1555) acquired the work and gave it as a present to Daitokuji, where the scrolls have been reverently treasured to this day. Beside Avalokitegvara, two other Bodhisattvas were included in the iconographical reper- toire of Zen painting, although they were by no means represented as often. They are ManjuAri (Chin. Wenshu, Jap. Monju) and Samantabhadra (Chin. Puxian, Jap. Fugen), already in the older iconography assigned to 8akyamuni as accompanying deities. They embody two aspects of the historical Buddha: his insight and wisdom on the one hand, his redeeming power, energy, and dynamic force on the other hand. They, too, appear in their Zen Buddhist version as secular, human-like, simple beings, sometimes with youth- ful, fresh faces and pendant strands of hair. They are without sumptuous adornment and clad in simple monastic robes. Their traditional vehicles, a lion for Monju and a white ele- phant for Fugen, symbolize their dignity, power, and wisdom; but they do not march proudly on clouds with lotus blossoms under their feet, nor are they equipped with pre- cious, bejeweled harness, saddles, or thrones, as in traditional Buddhist art. Rather, they are mostly lying comfortably on the ground, and the expression of the elephant often shows a mischievous smile. Nor is he equipped with the six tusks symbolizing, in ortho- dox Buddhist painting, the "Six Extra-Sensory Insights or Perfections", paramitas, of the Bodhisattva in respect to overcoming the "Six Sources of Temptation".

Among the old- est Japanese versions of this Zen Buddhist type are two ink paintings on silk at Ybmei'in, Tbfukuji, both inscribed by the sixth abbot of that great monastery, Zbzan Junku (1233-1308), one year before his death (Fig. 96).283 An exception is the Fugen painting - often mistakenly identified as Monju - at the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., by Takuma Eiga (active end of 14th century) showing the Bodhisattva in a landscape set- ting.284 Another unusual depiction of Monju is a scroll at Nanzenji, showing the Bodhisattva ManjuAri as meditating monk, Shdsc Monju, seated on a richly ornamented pedestal in front of an overhanging rock, reverently admired by two representatives of the secular world (No. 4).285 The incarnation of holy beings on another level of existence or in a dif- ferent identity, henyakushin, is not unusual in East Asian Buddhist art. Especially to Zen adepts, the Bodhisattva of the highest insight was the exemplary model in their search for the path to enlightenment. 3. Arhats The strict ascetic discipline of the Arhats (Chin. Luohan, Jap. Rakan), as well as their effort to reach the goal of enlightenment using their own power, zili (Jap. jirikl), made these Buddha disciples - originating from the oldest parts of Buddhist iconography - the very embodiment of Zen Buddhist monastic virtues. These "reverends" are beyond the this-worldly samsara cycle and appear mainly in predetermined formations, most often in groups of Sixteen Arhats. They differ from each other by specific attributes, super-human miraculous deeds, as well as by individual characteristics and gestures; as a rule, they are depicted as gnarled, sometimes bizarre old men with great spiritual powers. Thanks to their imprecisely determined iconography, they gave the artists ample opportunity for creative variety and individuality. Nevertheless, in the course of the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, Arhat sets, painted in Zen Buddhism less for private devotion than for public worship, seem to have congealed into standardized painting series frequently using similar compositions. In this process, the medieval Japanese painters often profited from the Chinese models. Two great traditions of different Arhat representations lead back to Guanxiu (832-912), a poet, calligrapher, and painter active toward the end of the Tang Dynasty, and to the Song master Li Gonglin (ca.1041 -1106). Guanxiu is one of the first outstanding Chan artists to emerge in some detail, although his Luohan figures, said to have been inspired by dream visions, are known only from copies or stone rubbings.286 The eccentric Guanxiu, who was steeped in Daoism, had an uncanny ability to imbue the distorted physiognomies of his Arhats with moments of religious ecstasy and at the same time show them as persuasive models of profound strength of faith, willpower, and inflexible seriousness in the struggle for spiritual deliver- ance. The oldest painted series of the Sixteen Arhats, however, may date to even earlier times. At least the authors of the Xuanhe huapu (chapter 10) mention, at the beginning of the twelfth century, two such Luohan sets of four and eight scrolls, respectively, in the Imperial Collection among the works of the famous Tang poet and painter Wang Wei (699-759). The latter had already made a career as ministerial official in his young years and had turned to Buddhism after the death of his wife in 730. He created wall paintings for a number of Buddhist monasteries in and around Chang'an and, significantly, chose as his artistic name the characters Mojie, analogous to the sinized form of the name Vimalakfrti, Weimojie, of the half-legendary Indian sage who attained the highest religious insight as lay adept. The learned court official, poet, and painter Li Gonglin had close and friendly ties with the leading men of the Buddhist clergy of his time and place. He was known for his inven- tiveness, his unorthodox ideas, and iconographical innovations, due to which many a fig- ure of the Buddhist pantheon appeared in quite a different light. He brought the "linear painting on white", i.e., without colours, the so-called baimiao technique, in Japanese hakubybga, to highest perfection. A handscroll in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., is attributed to the painter-monk Fanlong working in his succession during the 137</page><page sequence="131">twelfth century (Fig. 97).287 The scroll shows Sixteen Luohan with their disciples and wor- shipers in unusually subtle line drawing most likely representing the baimiao style of Li Gonglin very closely. It is hardly an accident that two colophons at the end of the scroll are written by eminent Chan priests: Yuansou Xingduan (1254-1341), the 48th abbot of Jingshan, and Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323). The latter remarks, after having admir- ingly described and eulogized the work: Lao-pien t'i-tien [Laobian Tidian] stores this painting in his sack. One day after medita- tion he brought this out to show me and asked me to inscribe after the painting. Respectfully written by Ming-pen [Mingben], the old priest who resides at the Hsi-t'ien- mu shan [Western Mt. Tianmu]. 288 Arhat paintings in the tradition of Li Gonglin were popular in Zen circles, and favoured particularly during the fourteenth century. In China as well as in Japan, the painters liked to place their Arhat figures into fantastic landscapes, deserted rock grottos, attractive gardens, or at least in front of a screen with a landscape painting. The spiritually released Buddha disciples are often accompanied by a servant, or an animal alluding to their mag- ical powers; but sometimes such animals are just ordinary living beings. Thus we encounter cheerful sparrows on a number of related representations of the 16th Arhat Cuidapanthaka seated in meditation in his cave (Fig. 98). The birds are evidently at ease with the holy man who sits motionless, and no less than twelve of them skip around in his lap and hide in his garment.289 In comparison with this intimate, even loving relationship between common representa- tives of nature and the other-worldly Buddha disciple, the Chan painter-monk Muqi shows the same relationship with a rather dramatic touch in his magnificent ink painting, evidently not belonging to a series, at the Seikadb Bunko, Tokyo.290 He shows the Arhat, his ungainly face marked by the exertions of secluded asceticism, in a fog-veiled cave. A snake with an aggressive appearance and wide-open jaws glides toward the saint. Its head lies already above the Arhat's left thigh and its eyes look up to him in challenge. But the Arhat, protector of the Buddha's teaching appointed by S5kyamuni himself, is immersed so deeply in meditation that he remains unimpressed and effortlessly over- comes the natural threats of his surroundings due to his powerful, enlightened superior- ity. A poem by the gozan literatus Gido Shuishin (1325-1388) about a "Picture of a High Priest" which almost reads like a concise description of Muqi's Luohan painting seems to suggest that the scroll has been known in Japan as early as the fourteenth century: The robe thrown over his shoulders conceals the head of an old Zen monk. By a steep rocky bank he is seated tranquilly on a rock. He only knows that drowsiness becomes meditation And is not aware that his body has been encircled by a python.291 4. Budai/Hotei While the Arhats represent the serious, disciplined, ascetic aspect of the Zen spirit, fig- ures such as Budai/Hotei, Hanshan/Kanzan, and Shide/Jittoku or Fenggan/Bukan sym- bolize a new religious dimension characterized by vitality, unconventionality, and humour. In the course of time, so many legends and anecdotes have surrounded Budai that it has become impossible to filter out the historical facts of his biography.292 It would appear that he was a migrant Chinese mendicant monk by the name of Qici hailing from Siming (Ningpo). He died in 916 (or 905) at Yuelinsi, a Chan monastery at which he spent an exceptional three years. All sources describe Budai as an always good-humoured, jok- ing character with a fat belly and a large beggar's sack to collect alms, but also stones and wood. His popular nickname Budai literally means "burlap sack", but also refers euphemistically to his enormous belly. On his meanderings, Budai is said to have mumbled incomprehensible words half to himself, to have played with children, and to have laughed and danced around. For Zen painting, this scintillating figure, in which posterity saw an incarnation of the future Buddha Maitreya, offered an opportunity for the glorification of the frugal, untram- 138 q N~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i 424 Fig. 97 Luohan from a handscroll with 16 Arhats, attributed to Fanlong (active first half 12th century).

We find Budai represented pointing with a laugh into empty space or to the moon (Figs. 23-24); happily patting his always bare belly (No. 11, Figs. 88, 91); pleasurably yawning and sleepily stretching; relaxing pensively on his beg- gar's sack or sleeping (Fig. 99); teasingly trying to pull away the pillow from under a child that fell asleep on his sack; watching a rooster's fight; having an eye suddenly appear on his back when his follower Jiang Zongba scrubs him there; or happily rambling across the country with his sack hanging from his pilgrim's staff on his shoulder. In Japanese folkloric belief, Hotei is one of the "Seven Gods of Luck" and considered to be the pro- tective patron of children. Soon after his death, according to a source dating to the end of the tenth century, paint- ings of the eccentric Zen monk were made in the east coast region of China, today's Zhejiang Province. The Butsunichi'an kcmotsu mokuroku, an inventory of Chinese art treasures - mainly paintings and writings - compiled in 1363 on the basis of an old list of 1320, at the Butsunichi'an, a small cloister of Engakuji in Kamakura, mentions an imported Budai painting that must have been painted in 1163 or earlier, as it bears an inscription of the eminent Chan master Dahui Zonggao deceased in that year. Perhaps it is identical with one of the two paintings whose inscriptions are recorded in Dahui's yulu.293 In another relatively early source, the "Recorded Sayings" of the Chan master Mi'an Hanjie (1107-1186), we find a reference to a Budai painting of the twelfth century,294 and the Rujing Heshang yulu lists a poem which Ddgen's teacher Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) composed for a painting with the title "Budai Listening to the Wind in the Pines".295 The theme is reminiscent of a short handscroll at the Sen'oku Hakkokan (Sumitomo Collection), Kybto, showing the corpulent, bald-headed mendicant monk standing near a clearing between sturdy pines partly hidden in the fog.296 The intriguing, if little noted, painting in ink on silk, mistakenly attributed to Ma Kui, brother of the court painter Ma Yuan active at the Imperial Academy around 1200, is one of the few Zen Buddhist figure paintings in handscroll format. The horizontal handscroll had been an ideal medium for narrative themes in East Asian painting. It was used occasionally in Zen painting, too, for the depiction of the embellishing, pseudo-biographical stories and the numerous fantastic episodes winding around semi-historical or legendary Zen figures. 139</page><page sequence="133">n III 4,', '4'.. -4,)" It', 4 ' '* F 4 ,. b.-... :l ''L.' 44 t It 140 Fig. 99 Laughing Hotei Resting on his Alms' Sack, with an inscription by Nanpo Jbmin (1235-1308), dated 1290.

(1979), No. 27. Song and Yuan paintings of the sansheng category, mainly hanging scrolls, reached Japan in large numbers at an early date. In the Gyomotsu on'e mokuroku of the fifteenth century, a total of nine paintings of Budai are listed as possessions of the Ashikaga Shbguns, among them a work by Ma Yuan with an inscription - added later - by the Chan monk Jitan Zongluo (1318-1391); an unusual half-figure painting of the mendicant monk inscribed by the Chan priest Jianweng Jujing who lived toward the end of the Southern Song Dynasty;297 and a version by Liang Kai with a poem of the renowned Chan prelate Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263). The latter also wrote the eulogy on a hanging scroll at Mybshinji, Kyoto, while he was abbot of Wanshousi on Jingshan during the last seven years of his life (1256-1263): How restlessly he wanders, how fast he runs! He comes and goes, he is here and there. In front of the Jewel Tower [of Maitreya] there are wet traces, Left by Shancai [Sudhana] - is he still recognized? Where the grass is dense and green. Guangwen, living on Mt. Jing. The humourous rendition of Budai shown in profile and seemingly holding his fat belly with laughter is signed "Li Que" in the lower left corner (No. 11, Figs. 88, 91). Not much is known about this gifted painter. Only Xia Wenyan in chapter 4 of his compilation of artists' biographies, the "Treasure Mirror of Painting", Tuhui baojian, dated to 1365 in the preface, mentions that Li Que studied "Liang Kai's painting on white". This statement does not tell us if he was a direct disciple of the master, although that does not seem impossible considering the dates secured by the painting's inscription. In his radically "abbreviating brush technique", the so-called jianbi manner, Li Que follows unmistakably Liang Kai who brought the genre to unparalleled concentration in the figure of his "Li Bai Reciting a Poem".298 Li Que has sometimes been identified with Li Quan, another Liang Kai follower, also men- tioned by Xia Wenyan. Considering the similarity of the two names, the purported dates for both artists, and the by no means unmistakable readings of artists' names even by Chinese experts, this theory is not necessarily far-fetched. Li Quan was a member of the Imperial Painting Academy at Hangzhou with the rank of an attendant, zhihou, during the Xianchun era (1265-1274).299 The question of whether Li Que and Li Quan were one and the same person cannot be answered with assurance. However, it cannot be disputed that around the middle of the thirteenth century the painter of the Budai painting was in contact with one of the most important members of the Chan clergy of Hangzhou, the reputed prelate Yanqi Guangwen who wrote an inscription for his painting. The stylistic affinity of the Budai painting with its pendant, the hanging scroll depicting the old monk "Fenggan and his Tiger" is also uncontested (No. 11). Even though this work is not signed, it is most likely by Li Que and was inscribed by Yanqi Guangwen at the same time: To understand only how to grasp the tiger's head Without getting a grip on its tail as well, That confused the old LOqiu [Yin]. 300 But this fault was his own. Yanqi Guangwen of Mt. Jing. Probably the oldest independent Japanese representation of Hotei is an ink painting of the late thirteenth century at Shinju'an of Daitokuji in Kyoto (Fig. 99). It bears an inscrip- tion dated to 1290 by the Zen prelate Nanpo Jomin (1235-1308) who was trained in China. The silk hanging scroll - unfortunately not very well preserved - by an anonymous artist showing us the merrily laughing Hotei relaxing on his tightly stuffed sack, is one of the earliest Japanese Zen paintings in monochrome ink.301 141</page><page sequence="135">5. The Three of Tiantaishan The famous hagiological work Jingde chuandeng Iu, "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007]" compiled by Daoyuan and completed in 1004, contains the biographies of a total of 1701 Indian and Chinese Chan masters going back to the "Seven Buddhas of the Past". Among these biographies, there are the ones of Fenggan/Bukan, Hanshan/Kanzan, and Shide/Jittoku, with the preliminary remark that they had reached the "Gate of Zen", but that they were not particularly famous at the time.302 They are indeed legendary figures who are vaguely believed to have a modicum of historical credibility on the basis of the preface to a Tang poetry compilation. The anthology contains three hundred "Poems of the 'Cold Mountain"' under the title Hanshan shi. The preface is attributed to LOqiu Yin, a prefect in the region of Taizhou who seems to have lived at the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth century. He credits Hanshan with the majority of the poems, and Shide as well as Fenggan with a few of them, claiming to have found the verses written on tree trunks and rocks, on house walls or inside rooms in the near village. LOqiu Yin describes Hanshan as a poor, learned eccentric living in the solitude of the Tiantai Mountains (Zhejiang Province). Dressed in shabby clothes and often behaving strangely, he would visit Guoqingsi near the provin- cial capital Tangxing, where a kitchen servant of the monastery by the name of Shide would supply him with remains of food. Shide, whose name means literally "foundling", had been found as a small child by Fenggan who had raised him in the monastery. Hanshan is said to have roamed the corridors of the monastery for hours on end, immersed in soliloquies or laughing out loud; when the monks, disturbed in their medi- tative silence, would chase him away, he would stand still all of a sudden, laugh and clap his hands, and then abruptly disappear. When Luqiu Yin was tormented by a strong headache before his departure to a new office and all medical attempts to cure him failed, only the Chan master Fenggan from Guoqingsi, as always accompanied by his tame tiger, was able to help him. Ltqiu Yin asked Fenggan if there were more Buddhist mas- ters in his old monastery whom he could consult in religious matters. Fenggan answered by telling him about Hanshan and Shide who were actually incarnations of the Bodhisattvas MahjugrT and Samantabhadra. After entering upon his new office, the ma- gistrate went immediately to the Guoqingsi to make the acquaintance of the two "saints". He met them in the monastery's kitchen and bowed to them reverently. But the two eccentrics who were just warming themselves near a stove began to shout and clamor in unison: "Fenggan, this old blabbermouth! You don't even recognize Buddha Amithaba [Fenggan] when you see him! What do you mean by bowing to us?" The monks who had heard the commotion ran to the kitchen and saw the strange situation, whereupon Hanshan took Shide by the hand, and they both escaped to their refuge in the mountains nearby. Later on, when the prefect had presents of clothes and medicaments brought to the hermits, Hanshan shouted at the messengers: "Thieves, thieves!" and crawled into his cave which closed after him. Shide, too, disappeared. On the basis of this appealing story in the preface - quite possibly pure literary fiction - and some poems of the anthology, Zen literature and painting developed three of their favourite figures: eccentric, earthy fellows of untamed mirth, sovereign spiritual freedom, and inner peace. A characteristic poem in the anthology of the "Cold Mountain" can be translated as follows: Do you have the poems of Hanshan in your house? They're better for you than sutra-reading! Write them out and paste them on a screen Where you can glance them over from time to time. 303 Hanshan, often shown with a brush and an empty book scroll, less frequently with a bucket for his food remains, or with his finger pointing upwards into the void, and Shide, usually with his kitchen broom, have been painted since the Song Dynasty as a roguishly laughing pair of fools with dishevelled hair, either together on the same scroll or on a dip- tych. Occasionally, they can be seen together in a painting or a diptych with their older spiritual mentor Fenggan, usually appearing as bald-headed, bearded monk. 142 302 Chapter 27, Taish6 shinshO daizoky6, No. 2076, Vol. 51, pp. 429c and 433b-434a. 303 Watson: Cold Mountain, p. 118.</page><page sequence="136">304Toda: op. cit.

An extremely attractive scroll with the three eccentric Zen sages is one attributed to Muqi, but most likely by an artist of his circle or a slightly later follower.304 With great humour and psychological insight, the scroll shows Hanshan about to use his pointed brush to write something on a steeply rising rock face at the left edge of the picture, while the barefoot Shide has put down his broom to grind ink for his inspired friend. The old Fenggan is cowering in front of a grotto emerging from the mist near a mountain stream. He grasps the pointed end of his beard with his right hand and - like Shide beside him - watches the unconventional, spontaneous writing by Hanshan with amused attention. At a closer look, one sees that Hanshan has already written four characters forming the opening line of a poem handed down by the "Cold Mountain": "My mind is like the autumn moon [...]."305 Among the best works uniting Hanshan, Shide, and Fenggan in a handscroll, a triptych, or a pair of hanging scrolls is the Japanese diptych by the Buddhist figure painter Reisai (known to have been active between 1435 and 1463) in the Burke Collection, New York.306 The right scroll shows the bald-headed Bukan from the back, seated on a flat rock behind which the head of the sleeping tiger can be seen; the left scroll depicts the gesticulating Kanzan, also from the back, in lively conversation with his laughing friend Jittoku. Reisai placed his figures in the lower quarter of both compositions on stage-like, abruptly ending plateaus, and suggested the boundless expansion of space by shadowy clouds rising into the wide, empty ground of the paintings. Most other known paintings of the subject present the unorthodox Zen partners Kanzan and Jittoku in extremely sparse, barely suggested scenic surroundings, or even renounce all decorative details. The latter is the case with the two small hanging scrolls in ink and light colours on silk in the Hosomi Collection, Osaka (No. 13). Both paintings bear the seals of Bokkei Saiyo, a painter active at the same time as Reisai in the middle of the fifteenth century in Kybto. Bokkei Saiyo was in close contact with Daitokuji and its 47th abbot Ikkyo Sbjun (1394-1481), according to inscriptions on two of his portraits of the Zen master dated to 1452 and 1453. On a half-figure image of Daruma at Shinju'an Ikkyu also wrote a eulogy in 1465. The scroll bears the square Bokkei and the round Saiyo seals.307 Bokkei was the oldest representative of a group of artists with the family name Soga, who served the mil- itary potentates of the Asakura clan in the province of Echizen, present-day Fukui Prefecture. Most likely he is identical with Hybbu Bokkei who died in 1473 in Ise and whom the learned monk Kisei Reigen (1404-1489) mentions in his anthology as a pupil of Shubun and frequent fellow traveller of IkkyG Sbjun. With daring, strikingly broad, jet- black brushstrokes, Bokkei defines the robes of the dynamic figures of Kanzan and Jittoku, contrasting the powerful brushwork with the delicate line play in the faces of his mischievously grinning Zen eccentrics. Pale, running ink solutions enhance the plasticity of the wrinkled drapery folds. For this effect, the painter uses the technique of the "con- fined or circumscribed wash", kukuri guma, in which a narrow strip between the edge of the wet wash and the line of the contour remains bare and a double contour is created, i.e., the "wash is circumscribed". During the fifteenth century, the Ashikaga Shbguns had several Chinese Hanshan and Shide paintings in their collection, among them one that Nbami attributes to Li Gonglin (ca.1041 -1106) in his catalogue, and another one purported to be by the celebrated painter-monk Muqi, with an inscription by the no less celebrated abbot Xutang Zhiyu (Jap. Kido Chigu, 1185-1269).308 According to the Butsunichi'an kdmotsu mokuroku, Engakuji, too, owned a pair of hanging scrolls depicting Hanshan and Shide, with an inscription by the same Chan master, already in the middle of the fourteenth century.309 The theme was thus extremely popular in medieval Japan, where a number of most attractive versions have been created since that time. 6. The Four Sleepers Zen painting developed literature's scintillating, farcical trio of Tiantaishan into a new sub- ject of unusual appeal by including the tame tiger of Fenggan as equal partner. Under the title the "Four Sleepers", sishul or shisul, the figures were represented cuddled up to each other and soundly asleep. Exactly when this theme was originally created is not clear, but it seems to have been an established part of Zen painting by the early thirteenth century, 143</page><page sequence="137">although the earliest examples extant date from about a hundred years later. The earli- est reference known to us concerning the artistic treatment of the subject is a poem in the Rujing Heshang yulu composed by the abbot Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) for a now lost painting of the "Four Sleepers": Shide, Hanshan, the old tiger, and Fenggan Are asleep and have arrived at the year of the donkey. The beginning of absolute nothingness, yeh! Suddenly the earth rises, and the future opens vivid eyes For a lot of apparitions and self-delusions.310 The "Recorded Sayings" of other Chan masters of the Southern Song and Yuan Dyn- asties also contain colophons for paintings of this subject. Such poems often mention the dream in which the sleeper attains insight into the true existence of things and his own Self. Thus, the Chan priest Qiaoyin Wuyi (died 1334) wrote the following verse for a lost sishui painting: Man and tiger form a unity. Why are they such fervent companions, When their heart and face are not the same? The dream-thought mutates the confusion. Wind rattles at the pine gate, And the colours of spring are late. 311 Another well-known abbot of the Yuan period, Pingshi Ruzhi (1268-1354), wrote the fol- lowing poem on a Yuan painting at the TOkyO National Museum (Fig. 100): Closely cuddled together and entwined in a tangle, Each is lost in his dream; The tiger into the Self of the tiger, Man into the Self of man.312 Statements of this kind make it clear that the theme of the "Four Sleepers" is meant to demonstrate the "insight into [one's own] Self leading to the realization of the Buddha Nature". They symbolize the absence of opposites in the mind cleansed by Zen practise and freed from the constraint of secular notions. In this merry quartet, the non-duality of man and animal seen in peaceful sleep and dream, the serenity attained by enlighten- ment, and the void expunging all opposites have been given visible shape as in hardly any other Zen painting theme. How surprisingly close together the real and the unreal can sometimes come, and how Zen considers this elimination of all limits as hint to the enlightening insight into the essence of things, is related in a letter of a Chinese Chan monk of the sixteenth century to his friend: In my youth, I once read [in Sengzhao, 384-414] that 'even hurricanes that eradicate mountains are in truth quiet; that the rushing rivers are not flowing; that the air dancing above the lakes in spring is not moving, and that sun and moon advancing in their orbit do not circle'. For many years, I doubted these words. But then, I once spent a winter in Pufan at master Miaofeng's. We were preparing a new edition [of Sengzhao's works] and I was reading the proofs. When I reached these sentences, I suddenly realized their meaning like an enlightenment. My joy knew no bounds. I jumped up and fell on my knees in front of Buddha's image, but, miraculously, my body did not move. I raised the door curtain and went outside to look around. A gust of wind shook the trees in the garden, and falling leaves whirled through the air. But in my imagination, not a single leaf was moving, and then and there I realized that [indeed] the storm that eradicates mountains is completely quiet.313 The central Buddhist notion of non-duality was formulated by the third Chan patriarch Sengcan (Jap. Sbsan, died 592) in his "Inscription on Relying on the Mind", Xinxinming (Jap. Shinjinmei), as follows: 144 310 Chapter 2, Taish6 shinshO daizdkyo, No. 2002A, Vol. 48, p. 131a. 311 Qiaoyin Wuyi Chanshi yulu, chapter 2, Dainippon zokuzdkyo, Vol. 150, p. 553c. 312 Kawakami, Toda, and Ebine: op. cit., No. 15, pp. 27 and 154. 313 Bauer: op. cit.

When the deep mystery of one Suchness is fathomed, All of a sudden we forget the external entanglements; When the ten thousand things are viewed in their oneness, We return to the origin and remain where we ever have been. Forget the wherefore of things, And we attain to a state beyond analogy; Movement stopped and there is no movement, Rest set in motion and there is no rest; When dualism does no more obtain, Oneness itself abides not. In the higher realm of true Suchness There is neither "self" nor "other": When direct identification is sought, We can only say, "Not two" [-] One in All, All in One - If only this is realized, No more worry about your not being perfect!314 In Japan, too, the dream was used from early times as metaphor for the dialectic of Being and Appearance, as well as for the transcendence of all dualities by the realization of the True Being. In the poetry anthology Kokinwakash0, commissioned by the Emperor Daigo (885-930), there is a striking tanka, a short poem of thirty-one syllables, about this sub- ject: Is the world a dream? Is it of substance? Say! - Neither substance-like, Nor dream, as far as I know. A something, a nothing in One. 315 In the traditional Mahayana idea that "Buddha can be seen in a dream", muchO kenbutsu, the notion of enlightenment - eliminating all opposites beyond reality - as dream-like emptying is expressed. Medieval Zen literature often uses "sleep" as a metaphor for "meditation" that transports the conscious mind out of the this-worldly realm, and dreams for the resulting, mutated reality level: the state of enlightenment. However, the concept developed by Zen of "explaining a dream within a dream", much setsumu, demonstrates the ambivalence of such dream notions. The dream could contribute to the ever deeper immersion into the boundless realm of non-consciousness or, on the other hand, to bring up its sub-conscious reality to the surface in order to understand it. In 1242, Dbgen (1200-1253) devoted a special lecture to the question of dreams, recorded in chapter 60 of the Shobbgenzb. He compares the "enlightenment within enlightenment" lived by the patriarchs with "explaining a dream within a dream", muchO setsumu, and reaches the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that a dream contains more reality than reality itself.316 The title of the three-volume work MuchO mondb, "Questions and Answers in a Dream" - written down by the eminent Zen prelate Muso Kokushi (1275- 1351), the "National Master of the Dream Window", upon the request of Ashikaga Naoyoshi in 1344 - was most likely selected with this aspect in mind. The 93 questions and answers of the fictional dream dialogue bespeak the openness, the syncretizing Zen 146 314 Verses 21-23, 25 and 30; see the English transla- tion by Daisetz T.

A relatively easily understood text, the MuchO mondo5 was extremely popular in Zen circles. Reality and dream also seem to have fused in the life of the mys- tically gifted Kegon-reformer Mybe Shbnin (1173-1232), to the extent that his disciples attributed visionary powers to him. His preferred place for meditation was the fork of a tree branch.318 He left a "Dream Diary", Yume no ki, in which hundreds of dreams are recorded in cryptic language.319 To the present day, the masters of the brush have written the character meng or mu (yume) for "dream" again and again. Others chose it for their clerical name, such as Muso Rybshin (died 1281), Muso Soseki (1275-1351), Mu'an Ken'ichi (14th century), Mugan Sob (died 1374), or the Chinese monk Tan'e (1285-1373) who contributed an inscription to the anonymous Yuan painting of the "Four Sleepers" at the Tokyo National Museum (Fig. 100). He was known under the names Mengtang, "Dream Hall", and Wumeng, "Dream of the Void". This profound, philosophical-poetic name was also used by Issei (1294-1368), the 30th abbot of Tbfukuji, who received a laudatory poem - extant in its original version - on his priest name Mumu, "Dream of the Void", by the hand of his Chan teacher Yuejiang Zhengyin (1267-after 1333) during his sojourn in China.320 The eccent- ric Zen master Ikkyi Sbjun (1394-1481) took the name "Dream Chamber", Mukei, in memory of his amorous adventures. In his introduction to four poems full of erotic allu- sions he wrote: If one is thirsty, one will dream of water. If one is cold, one will dream of a fur robe; to dream of the bed chamber, that is my nature. In old times and recently, there have been three named "Dream"; that is, the reverends Mus6 "Dream Window' [Musc Soseki], MusO "Dream High" [MusO Rycshin], and Mumu "No Dream" [Mumu Issei]. I recently took the name "Dream Chamber" [Mukei] and set it on a plaque over my study. Although that name treads in the footsteps of the other three "Dreams" it really does not match their affairs at all. Whereas those three masters were men of a vigorous virtue and flour- ishing apiration singled out by people, I am just an old madman down on my lucky ad- vertising what I like. So I composed four poems, entitling them "Chronicle of the Dream Chamber" 321 Beside the works known from their inscriptions listed in the "Recorded Sayings" of Zen masters, but now mostly lost, the subject of the "Four Sleepers" is also found in a pen- taptych mentioned in the Gyomotsu on'e mokuroku. Together with a version of the "Three Laughers of the Tiger Ravine", the hanging scrolls flanked a Kannon painting with the almost inevitable, but today somewhat questionable, attribution to Muqi.322 However, there are three excellent originals - quite different from each other - dating to the first half of the fourteenth century. Perhaps the oldest extant version of the subject was painted by the Japanese painter-monk Moku'an Rei'en who was active in China for two decades until his death in 1345; a certain Xiangfu Shaomi (or maybe Shaomi of the Xiangfu Monastery) added the inscription which again mentions the "Big Dream" of the four sleepers cuddled against each other (Fig. 101): Old F~ng-kan [Fenggan] embraces his tiger and sleeps, All huddled together with Shih-t6 [Shide] and Han-shan [Hanshan] They dream their big dream, which lingers on, While a frail old tree clings to the bottom of the cold precipice. Shao-mi [Shaomi] of the Hsiang-fu [Xiangfu temple] salutes with folded hands.323 Moku'an's masterpiece at the Mae'da Ikutokukai, Tokyo, is a superb example of a mono- chrome ink painting style - flourishing in Chan circles during the later Song and the Yuan Dynasty - that owes its inner life above all to spontaneity and the unconventional use of the brush. In sharp contrast to the Moku'an painting are the two other examples, both probably dating to the fourteenth century: a painting in colours on silk at the Ryoko'in of Daitokuji, Kybto,324 concentrating exclusively on the figural arrangement; and an almost identical version as regards the figures, but of quite different overall effect: the picture at the Tokyo National Museum is painted in monochrome ink, its fine, detailed line vocab- 147</page><page sequence="141">ulary reminiscent of the stylistic tradition of Li Gonglin (ca.1041 -1106), and enhanced by an intricate scenic background (Fig. 100).325 On the basis of biographical details that can be deduced from the inscriptions of the three Chan priests Pingshi Ruzhi (1268-1357), Huaguo Ziwen (1269-1351), and Mengtang Tan'e (1285-1373), it is safe to assume that the work dates to the period between 1329 and 1348. More than a century later, the shogunal artistic consultant Geiami (1431-1485) and Shutsei, an ink painter evidently active in Kyoto around the middle of the fifteenth century and possibly identical with the Zen monk Sesshin Tohaku (1383-1459), took up the sub- ject of the "Four Sleepers". For the horizontal hanging scroll format of their paintings at the ldemitsu Museum of Arts, Tokyo,326 and at Shoin'an of Nanzenji, Kybto (No. 14),327 they developed a suitable composition formula: on the left, Kanzan and Jittoku, shown en face, are leaning on the also frontally depicted tiger in the middle of the quartet, and on the right, the seated, bent-over Bukan, in profile and turned to the right, is nestled with his back against the soft fur of the tiger. Compared with older versions, this com- position seems looser, less compact, and the suggestive indication of the stage-like land- scape as well as the sparse vegetation further contribute to that impression. If one accepts the identification of the painter Shutsei - known by a few works bearing his seal - with the gozan abbot Sesshin Tohaku, it is not surprising to encounter in his works the stylistic influence of the great painter-monk Shuibun, who was active until about 1460 at Shbkokuji 328 The "Four Sleepers" in their unpretentious garb epitomize the highest Zen Buddhist ideals. Removed from the deceiving circuit of secular realities - in this case subtly empha- sized by their transition into the realm of dreams and peaceful slumber - they are espe- cially appropriate to represent "spiritual depth", yugen; "unworldliness", datsuzoku; and "inner serenity", seijaku, to quote a few of the terms which Hisamatsu Shinichi has stip- ulated as characteristics of a work of Zen art. The great popularity and wide dispersion of the "Four Sleepers" theme created in Zen circles can be seen in a number of seventeenth-century Kano-school shukuzu, sketch- like copies in reduced size of now mostly-lost paintings,329 and not least in a Turkish miniature of the early Osmanic period.330 There can be no doubt that the small tondo, most likely painted at the court of Mehmet the Conqueror in Istanbul during the fifteenth century, is directly indebted to a Chinese Yuan Dynasty prototype, as may be another version in round format in the Langen Collection.331 Fenggan or Bukan was also treated as separate figure subject, resting on his tiger, rid- ing on it, or standing beside it. He seems to have been included into the iconographical repertoire of Zen painting long before his friends from Guoqingsi: even if the famous painting - in spontaneous ink technique on paper - of the monk resting with closed eyes on his sleeping tiger (No. 10) is most likely a thirteenth century copy, the spurious signa- ture of the eccentric artist Shi Ke (died after 975) may be an indication that the legendary theme was already adapted to painting in the tenth century. The work, formerly belong- ing to Shohoji in Kyoto and now kept at the TokyO National Museum, shows Fenggan as the prototype of the enlightened Zen patriarch, sleeping or in meditation, and thus com- pletely oblivious of his surroundings. The scroll is part of a diptych, its pendant showing a monk, perhaps the second patriarch Huike, deeply immersed in meditation. In a slightly modified copy of the pendant to this work, a painter supposedly of the Yuan Dynasty added a sleeping tiger and some landscape elements to change the figure into Fenggan and present him as an iconographical unit in a triptych with Hanshan and Shide on the flanking scrolls. The three little noticed paintings in ink on silk belong to the Fujita Mu- seum in Osaka.332 7. Xianzi/Kensu Another eccentric figure of Zen Buddhist imagery is Xianzi (also Xiazi), in Japanese Kensu OshO, "Reverend Kensu", the "Prawn Fisher". At times, he was shown together with Zhutou or ChotO, the "Pig Head", in a diptych, probably because the two untrammeled figures ignored the conventional vegetarian diet of the Buddhist clergy with their favourite 148 325 Ibid., No. 15, p. 27. 326 Idemitsu Museum of Arts, ed.: Kaikanf jgo shurnen kinenten zuroku - The 15th Anniversary Catalogue, No. 166, p. 27, and Idemitsu Museum of Arts, ed.: Nihon no kaiga hyakusen - One Hundred Master- pieces of Japanese Paintings.

Already the famous Chan master Dahui Zonggao (1089-1163), the 13th Jingshan abbot and 19th prelate of Ayuwang- shan, composed a colophon for a lost Zhutou painting.

Supposedly, Xianzi attained enlightenment while catching a prawn. Chinese and Japanese artists, among them the two important painter-monks Muqi and K'ao, have depicted him since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as a bearded old fellow in shabby clothes, with a fishing net and a prawn held up ostentatiously in the air. The painting of the laughing Xianzi by Muqi bears an inscription, running from left to right toward the line of sight of the figure, by the Chan master Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263) during his term as abbot of Lingyinsi near Hangzhou from 1254 until 1256.335 In his loose, spontaneous brush- strokes, the artist congenially adapted the style of the painting to the subject of the prawn fisher roaming about in torn clothes. Probably just a century later, the Japanese painter- monk Ka'o represented the "Reverend Kensu" in a landscape setting (No. 12, Fig. 2). On a narrow strip of land under an overhanging cliff with lianae dangling down, the laughing, bald-headed old man - shown in profile looking to the left - almost triumphantly holds aloft a wriggling prawn, obviously just caught. Ka'o reduces the figure to a minimum, con- trasting lighter ink accents and sparse, darker ones. He also precisely sets off descrip- tive details, especially on the head, hands, and feet, from the broad lines of the drapery, which lend the casually worn upper garment a certain degree of volume. On the left leg of the trousers, there is a large, roughly stitched patch. Near the right, lower edge, two square seals, Ka'b and Ninga, identify the artist of this masterpiece of early Japanese ink painting at the Tokyo National Museum.336 The painter Ka'o may have been the Zen monk Ka'o Sonen, from Chikugo, modern Saga Prefecture, who spent two years at Kenchoji in Kamakura as a disciple of the experienced Zen master Nanpo Jomin (1235-1308). In 1319, Ka'o Sonen set out to China with a group of fervent Zen adepts, continuing his studies under such renowned teachers as Gulin Qingmao (1262-1329) and Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323). Upon his return, he was successively appointed as abbot of three great Zen monasteries in Kybto, first in the 16th generation to Manjuji. Subsequently, he headed Kenninji for a short time as 28th abbot, and finally he became the 18th abbot of Nanzenji in 1345, shortly before his death. Ka'o Sonen died on the 24th day of the eighth month of 1345. No source explicitly mentions him as painter; but if he did indeed affix the two seals to the Kensu Osho painting, the date of his death would provide an important terminus ante quem. The enchanting paint- ing at the Yamato Bunkakan in Nara, "Sparrow on a Rock and Bamboo", bears practi- cally identical seal impressions.337 However, it is surprising that, in contrast to other paint- ings by Zen abbots, none of the paintings by Ka'o that are considered authentic bears an inscription by a contemporary gozan colleague reliably confirming the dating prior to 1345. 8. Bodhidharma One of the most important subjects of Zen painting has always been Bodhidharma (died before 534), the 28th patriarch after Sakyamuni and traditional founder of Chan in China. While some modern authors question even the historicity of the Indian arch-patriarch, various records by earlier chroniclers inextricably mix historical fact with amply embel- lished legends.338 One of the most popular episodes is the encounter of Bodhidharma with Emperor Wu (464-549, reigned 502-549) of the Liang Dynasty. As sincere patron of Buddhism, the Chinese monarch is said to have summoned the Indian monk to his court in Nanjing in order to have the new ideas of Chan expounded first-hand. But the interested Emperor did not understand the meaning of the peculiar saint's abrupt, para- doxical answers. The Chan patriarch gave the Emperor short shrift, left the court without saying farewell, and headed north to the monastery on Mt. Song in the state of Wei, where he remained in meditation for nine years. None of the traditional Tang texts dating before the late eighth century mentions Bodhidharma's visit at the Liang court. Although later literature has dealt with this encounter over and over again, embroidering it with ever more fictitious details, painters seem to have found no appeal at all in it. In any case, no early representations of the sub- 149</page><page sequence="143">ject have come down to us, maybe because artists of Zen circles wanted to avoid impair- ing the only just consolidated esteem of the school's founder by showing his not exactly reverential behaviour toward the Emperor. The great persecution of Buddhism throughout China in 845 had maimed the church as an established institution. The devastation of Buddhist property, sacred sites and objects, holy scriptures and saints was severe. Buddhism suffered a sharp decline. The less institutionalized Chan school apparently tried to regain its full strength by empha- sizing the mysterious indestructible power of their major figures. In this process apo- cryphal episodes of the Bodhidharma biography glorifying the Indian arch-patriarch as a super-human figure endowed with wondrous powers were given great attention in one phase of the apotheosis. Thus, the legend of his "Crossing the Yangzi River on a Reed" after his impetuous departure from the Liang imperial court enjoyed great popularity among painters as well as literati.339 In Zen Buddhist sources of the thirteenth century, such as the Wujia zhengzong zan, "Eulogies from the Five Houses in the True School", compiled and edited in 1254 by Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?), it is mentioned that Bodhidharma "broke off a reed, crossed the river, arrived at Shaolin[si], and faced a wall for nine years", zhelu dujiang zhi Shaolin mianbi jiu nian. However, this text does not say that the patriarch actually used the reed to cross the river. Common believers simply accepted the tradition originating in this misunderstanding, while the learned masters of meditation interpreted it as a metaphor for the extraordinary, supernatural powers of the self-willed patriarch.340 There are signs that the story of Bodhidharma's miraculous crossing of the Yangzi was already known at the beginning of the twelfth century. But the oldest known images of the subject, called Royo (tokb) Daruma in scholarly literature, date to the thirteenth cen- tury. An outstanding ink painting, unfortunately lost during the disorders of the Second World War, was inscribed by the master of meditation Changweng Rujing (1163-1228), highly esteemed in Japan, too, as Dbgen's teacher (Fig. 90).341 Another version, however, dating to the first half of the thirteenth century, is extant at the Tokugawa Bijutsukan in Nagoya; it bears an inscription by the hand of the eminent Chan abbot Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) who commented upon this theme: He rudely offended the Liang Emperor. In deep sorrow he crossed the stream. For nine years in the cold he was sitting in deep continuous meditation. Repeatedly he defeated his opponents in debate. One flower and five petals all grow on their own, Unaffected by the intentional blows of the spring wind. [/Wuzhun] Shifan of Mt. Jing reverently folds his hands.342 The Masaki Bijutsukan in Tadaoka owns a hanging scroll by an anonymous Yuan painter active around 1300 showing the old Indian founder patriarch, seemingly with three feet, in rough brushstrokes outlining the figure on a reed (Fig. 102). Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) wrote the following poem on the scroll: The ten thousand miles of the Long Stream He navigated on a reed. If you would ask how [that was possible, one would have to say]: One single transmission, direct pointing. From now on who wants to ride with him? [Zhongfeng] Mingben of Huanzhu/an] reverently folds his hands.343 One of the most beautiful Japanese works of the subject, at Jodoji in Shizuoka Prefecture (No. 8), is indebted to the formal discipline of academic Song painting such as demon- strated by Liang Kai in his masterpiece Shussan Shaka (No. 1). This is evident especially in its fluid, rhythmical line vocabulary and the accentuated onset of the brush. The Jodoji painting bears an inscription of the Chinese Zen master Yishan Yining (1 247-1 31 7), active in Japan since 1299.

Dietrich Seckel has shown convincingly that this hand position, specific for Zen iconography and seen as a rule in paintings of Shussan Shaka and Royb Daruma, signi- fies the "silent possession of truth". "For Bodhidharma as prototype of the Zen-enlight- ened person, too, the absence of words is significant. At the same time, the veiling [of the hands] also serves to avoid the otherwise inevitable choice of a Mudr5, i.e., a well formulated statement, words by means of a precise symbolic sign; thus, in the sense of Zen, it may well be appropriate to speak of a non-Mudr6, even an anti-Mudr6."345 Legend has it that during his nine years of meditating in front of a rock face at Shaolinsi on Mt. Song, the central of the five sacred Chinese peaks north of Dengfeng in Henan Province,346 Bodhidharma subjected himself to similarly stringent ascetic exercises as the historical Buddha (Fig. 103). Already the voluminous biographical anthology by Daoyuan, the "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004- 1007]", relates the incident on the Songshan. The Chuanfa zhengzongjl, the "Record of the Transmission of the Law in the True School" by the Chan priest Fori Qisong (1007- 1072), finished in 1061 and dedicated to the Northern Song Emperor Renzong (reigned 1022-1063) one year later, mentions that, because of his peculiar way of meditating, people called Bodhidharma the "wall-contemplating Brahmin". Even earlier sources, con- taining the first reflexes of Bodhidharma's teachings, contain the term biguan, literally "facing the wall" or "wall contemplation". It would appear that this expression originally designated a certain kind of meditation practice in early Chan. Some scholars are of the opinion that the term might be a metaphor for Bodhidharma's unverbalized teaching of mind and its essence of "knowing", for the unprecedented "steepness and suddenness of enlightenment", but hardly an instruction for meditation to be taken literally, as the idiom biguan was understood by some writers.347 Already the noted Chan and Huayan school theoretician Zongmi (780-841) gave explicit reference to and explanation of this troublesome term: Bodhidharma taught people pacification of the mind through wall contemplation, in which externally one ceased discrimination and internally one made one's mind free of 'gasp- ing' (i.e., free of impediments and attachments?). When the mind is like a wall one can enter into enlightenment Ou-tao [rudao]) - truly, is this not a method of meditation?348 The episode of Bodhidharma's nine-year meditation in front of the rock face at Shaolinsi may thus have been born partly from a misunderstanding, and partly from the fertile fan- tasy of Song Dynasty Chan literati and painters. Shokai Reiken (1315-1396) may well have alluded to this tradition from the biography of the Indian founder patriarch when he wrote his four-line poem on a Bodhidharma portrait at Taiko'an of Tofukuji in 1394 toward the end of his life (No. 9): My bed is cold when I'm asleep at night. Mulberry-paper cassock, paper mosquito curtain Following the Dharma, acting as circumstances demand With my hemp-palm chowry, and goosefoot staff Taikb, [age] eighty. 349 No doubt the author of these lines identifies himself with the rigorous meditation exer- cises of Bodhidharma, undergone under the most difficult circumstances. On the hang- ing scroll, which has been preserved at the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, the Indian patri- arch is shown in strict frontality and rendered, except for the delicately drawn face, in one continuous brushstroke. Hence its popular name lppitsubyb no Daruma, "One Brushline Bodhidharma", or Kurukuru no mi'ei, "Round-and-Round Venerable Image". If this dynamic ink painting should also be by Reiken, the 43rd abbot of Tbfukuji, the austere 151</page><page sequence="145">2 M TV W- - 03. 4 9r- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3 . - - 4 -~~ .. -, ', I 4.-' '~~~~~~~~4 TIF,~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~'.- - F X . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-~ - -.4 ~~~~~~~- _ I.' _ ~~~~~- _ . , p 152gs : Fig. 103 Bodhidharma Meditating on a Rock Plateau under a Pine Tree, with an inscription by Yshang Yining (Jap.

The exceptional countenance of the image is certainly not the stereotyped robust exotic physiognomy of the Indian founding patriarch of Chan in China with a rough dark beard, prominent nose, and glaring eyes. The physical characteristics and the individual features of this stern face are rendered with a fine brush in extremely thin and sensitive lines delib- erately juxtaposed with the abbreviated brushwork of the cassock. It is known that Shokai Reiken felt a special affinity for and resemblance to Bodhidharma. Staring out directly at the observer he may have intended to represent himself in the guise of his admired forefather. Comparison with a formal chinzo of Shbkai Reiken owned by the Taikb'an of the Tbfukuji in Kybto and dated 1379 with the sitter's own inscription seems to substantiate this idea of a hidden self-portrait.350 The pensive expression of the face and the long strands of the beard in particular are very similar in both images. By identi- fying himself with Bodhidharma Shbkai Reiken pointed directly at his own mind and his true inner nature. In painting, the subject of "Bodhidharma Meditating Facing a Cliff", also known as Damo mianbi (Jap. Menpeki Daruma), was often expanded by the event immediately succeed- ing in the traditional biography. When a Chan adept by the name of Huike heard of Bodhidharma's unremitting meditation, he set out for Shaolinsi on Mt. Song in order to ask the great master to accept him as disciple. But the Indian patriarch ignored him. In the end, Huike severed his left arm as proof of his determination to make any sacrifice for the sake of the Chan succession. Upon this dramatic demonstration, Bodhidharma accepted the fearless Chinese disciple and made him, after he had attained enlighten- ment, the second patriarch in the long line of his successors. A number of memorial shrines and stelae of various dates engraved with eulogies and images of the first patri- arch were erected on Mt. Song. In one of them, the "Record of the Restoration of the Facing-the-Wall Shrine" dated 1222, the syncretic scholar Li Chunfu (1185-1231) wrote: Of old, when the great being, Bodhidharma, was facing the wall in meditation for nine years, Hui-k'o [Huike, "Spiritual Light"], who had formerly engaged in Confucian studies and had emphasized abstruse [Taoist] learning, met the founder at this place. Only after standing in the snow and cutting off his arm did he understand the ideas that had come from the West. Thus the untransmitted subtleties behind the words of Confucius and Lao-tzu [Laozi] found full expression and became greatly prominent in the world.351 This key event of Zen has come down to us in a large hanging scroll at Sainenji, Aichi Prefecture, by the famous Japanese painter-monk Sesshi Toyo (1420-1506), a stirring rendition full of profound religious gravity (No. 17, Fig. 7). Sessho, who had entered a Zen monastery at the early age of eleven, painted the moving composition in 1496 at the age of 77 (76 in accordance with western calculation), as the signature near the left edge of the painting reveals. He shows the two Zen patriarchs in rigid, parallel profile. The bristle- bearded, bald-headed Huike holds the severed arm in front of his chest, his firmly deter- mined eyes looking straight forward. By boldly cutting off the figure at the lower edge of the painting, the painter alludes indirectly to what textual traditions and numerous Zen poems state in connection with this dramatic encounter: Huike sank into the snow up to his waist when he presented his sacrificed arm to Bodhidharma. An anonymous Song painter of the late thirteenth century depicted the event similarly in a hanging scroll at the Cleveland Museum of Art (Fig. 104).352The black bearded Indian stares - with wide open eyes in imperturbable concentration - at the wall of the rock grotto. In his version of the figure, Sesshi succeeds in representing a typical Zen Buddhist paradox: the seemingly contradictory notion of accomplishing "heavy spiritual labour" until complete exhaustion while remaining completely immobile physically. Accordingly, the striking contrast between the bizarre rocks rendered with vibrating dots and texture strokes and the boldly contoured figure of Bodhidharma in white reserve is to be interpreted most likely as a reversal of natural conditions by the Zen spirit: the rocks seem to have come to breath- ing life, while the meditating man resembles a lifeless, immovable rock. In this master- piece, Sesshti has visualized an alarming event of radical Zen denouement leading to complete self-surrender. He has left those in search of true enlightenment a model, zenkizu, a "Zen auxiliary image" of the highest rank. 153</page><page sequence="147">The fanciful stories glorifying life, work, and character of the traditional Chan founder in China do not end with the death of Bodhidharma. In a visionary apotheosis he was endowed with the qualities of a Daoist immortal and attributed a kind of liberation from the corpse. A legend recorded already in the tenth century relates how Song Yun, a native of Dunhuang and chief emissary of the Northern Wei court, returned to China around the year 520 from a mission to the Western Regions in search of Buddhist scriptures.353 At the "Onion Range", Congling, in Central Asia [i.e., the Pamirs] he met the already de- ceased Indian patriarch Bodhidharma, who is said to have worn only a single shoe on his way West. When Song Yun reported the strange encounter to the Emperor, the latter allegedly had Bodhidharma's grave opened and the second shoe was indeed found there. The legend located the tomb not at Shaolinsi, but on "Bear's Ear Mountain", Xiongershan, not too far away in Henan Province. The account of the meeting with Song Yun occurs in its elaborate, clearly apocryphal "single-shoe" rendition in the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall", Zutang 1l, of 952 and in the "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007] ".354 The subject of the "Patriarch Bodhidharma Returning West with One Shoe", Damo zushi zhilO xigui, in Japanese Sekiri Daruma, was treated not only in literature, but also in art. Chinese as well as Japanese painters turned their attention to it as early as the thirteenth century. In 1222 a stone stele was erected at Shaolinsi that shows Bodhidharma in three- quarter view facing left, i.e., west.355 The bald-headed and barefooted Indian patriarch is wearing a Chinese monk's robe. In his left hand he holds a fly whisk and in his right he carries one shoe. A seven-syllable poem and a eulogy appear in the upper portion of the stele. The four lines of the poem incised in the year 1209 recount the miraculous encounter in Central Asia: Bodhidharma entered nirvana in the years of the Taihe [era of the Northern Wei Dynasty, 477-499]. On "Bear's Ear Mountain" Xiongershan, his pagoda and temple were complete. Had it not been for Song Yun's meeting at the "Onion Range" Congling, Who would know that he went to the Western Heavens with a single shoe?356 Perhaps the best version extant of the theme is at the Masaki Bijutsukan in Tadaoka near Osaka (Fig. 105).357 Bearing an encomium, dated to 1296, by the Suifukuji abbot Nanpo Jomin (1 235-1308), a prominent Zen master trained in China, the scroll demonstrates the reception of Chinese ink painting in Japan at the time of the Song Dynasty and thus is an extremely important work in the history of East Asian painting. Its type and certain motifs, such as the forward fluttering robe, has a close similarity with representations of Royb Daruma and Shussan Shaka. Although the development of each single case cannot be traced exactly, it is safe to assume that there was a stimulating mutual effect - rooted in the spiritual-artistic climate - responsible for the typological affinity among these three subjects. After all, these sub- jects deal with the depiction of legendary biographical details; they are dynamic "narra- tive paintings" commemorating historical events of fundamental importance for the Zen school and thus are clearly disparate from the type of static saviour images - to avoid the word "cult image", a term that is not quite appropriate in the case of Zen art - such as representations of the historical Buddha or some paintings of the Bodhisattva Avalokitegvara. 9. Portraits of Patriarchs In contrast to the subjects already discussed, which are characterized by transient action, the rather static portraits of the great Chan patriarchs are aimed at independence from space and time. The classic way of representing Bodhidharma, enhanced to super- human magnitude, is the half-figure three-quarter profile view, hanshinzb. Among the striking characteristics of this idealized portrait are the un-Chinese facial features of the patriarch - clad in a simple monk's robe -, his luxuriant beard, his large ears with orna- mental earrings, and especially the hypnotic, riveting glare of his eyes (Fig. 106). The exaggerated size of the eyes and the intensity of the gaze are no doubt an allusion to the 154 Fig. 105 Bodhidharma Returning West with One Shoe, Sekiri Daruma, with an inscription by Nanpo Jbmin (1235-1308), dated 1296.

Song, a tradition that is further embroidered by an apocryphal legend: it is said that when Bodhidharma was overpowered by fatigue and his eyes closed at one point during these nine years, he became so angry with himself that he cut off his eyelids. At the spot where they fell to the earth, a tea bush sprouted miraculously; and indeed, tea was drunk in Zen circles from early times to overcome fatigue during long periods of meditation. The category of the half-figure patriarch portrait can be traced back to the twelfth cen- tury on the basis of extant originals. The image at Mybshinji, Kybto, is among the most impressive of such portraits (No. 6). Brought to paper with a few powerful brushstrokes and a velvety ink wash, it has been the central part of a triptych in Japan for a long time. The flanking hanging scrolls show Budai and Fenggan (No. 11); they are by Li Que, who signed his name on the Budai scroll in the left lower corner. The upper half of the anony- mous Bodhidharma painting bears a four-line gatha by Mieweng Wenli (1167-1250), read from left to right. The eminent Chan abbot alludes to two episodes of the first patriarch's biography: the fruitless encounter with the Emperor Wu of Liang, and the mysterious return of Bodhidharma across the Central Asian desert after his death. One of the earliest, and at the same time best, Japanese half-figure portraits of Daruma is owned by the Izumishi Kuboso Kinenkan (No. 7). The anonymous painter depicted the bearded, bald-headed Indian with fierce, awe-inspiring facial expression and luxuriant chest hair. The robe is characterized by broad, bursting strokes applied with a bristly brush accentuating the rough effect of "overflown white", hihaku. The upper half of the scroll bears a eulogy by Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339). The Chinese Chan master wrote the inscription in 1326, only two months after his arrival in Japan, while staying at a Zen monastery in or near Hakata in today's Fukuoka Prefecture. He devoted his sojourn in Japan above all to the adaptation of Chinese monastic rules, meticulously adhered to by himself, to Japanese conditions. As one might suspect, the portrait group rather than the single portrait is the oldest cat- egory in the development of Zen Buddhist portrait painting. The earliest recorded as well as the earliest extant examples are portraits of patriarchs in generational succession. Because of the iconographical program, the portrait series was obviously the most appropriate form of representation. Such portrait series were usually composed as sets of contiguous single portraits on separate hanging scrolls. Sometimes, however, the artist would unite about five patriarchs on the same hanging scroll, and join a number of such scrolls into a continuous portrait series (Figs. 107-108). The size of a series, usually ranging from three to forty hanging scrolls, is thus not determined exclusively by the num- ber of the persons depicted. As for the placement of the portraits, great attention was paid to assigning the portrayed Zen masters a place, in accordance with their genealo- gical position, to the right or the left of a central axis, often marked by a Sakyamuni image. As a rule, the patriarchs with odd place numbers face toward the left, i.e., their portrait was hung to the right of a central image or of an imaginary central axis; the mas- ters with even place numbers appear in three-quarter profile toward the right on the other, i.e., the left, side. Since such sets of images usually show the old key masters of Zen, the half-figure effigy, preferred for patriarchs' portraits, is predominant.358 Portrait sets of Buddhist patriarchs have a long tradition in a number of different East Asian schools. However, in contrast to portraits of other schools, such as Zhenyan (Jap. Shingon) or Tiantai (Jap. Tendai), marked by their idealistic style, Zen portraits are espe- cially characterized by their realism. On the other hand, representations of early Chan patriarchs in the so-called soshizo, "patriarchs' portraits", are almost exclusively based on ideal concepts of the master's personality and - similar to other schools - fulfill gen- eral ceremonial tasks. Among the oldest recorded portrait sets of the six first Chan patriarchs in China are the now-lost hanging scrolls which, at the beginning of the twelfth century, still belonged to the voluminous collection of the Song Emperor Huizong (1082-1135). This is recorded in the Xuanhe huapu (chapter 5), where the paintings are attributed to the figure painter Chen Hong active at the Tang court around the middle of the eighth century. If this attri- bution is correct, the scrolls were painted just at the time when Shenhui (684-758) fought 155</page><page sequence="149">~~~~~~~~~~A w . _ 4 - . t 4 ~~4 II ~~~~*~~~~~~~~~f A ~~~~~~~~~~A 44~~~~~~~~~~ ~"A~A f -V -St~~~~~~~~S 41 I,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~M over the correct succession as sixth patriarch with his master Huineng in a struggle that was not resolved until a council was convened by the Emperor Dezong in 796. Subsequently, portrait series of the first six Chan patriarchs in China became part of the standard repertory of Zen Buddhist figure painting. In the Yizhou minghua Iu, dated in the preface to 1006, we find several references to such wall painting cycles in various impor- tant monasteries of present-day Sichuan Province, e.g. by the emigrant artist Zhang Nanben (active during the second half of the 9th century) and by the Chan painter-monk Lingzong at Dashengci Monastery, also active in Chengdu around the middle of the tenth century, as well as by his cousin Qiu Wenbo (active ca.932-965) at a Chan cloister, the Qianmingchanyuan. At that time, the Dashengcisi already had a special cloister, the Liuzuyuan, dedicated to the "Six Patriarchs". Unfortunately, Huang Xiufu, the author of that "Report on Famous Painters in Yizhou", does not tell us anything about what those early patriarchs' portraits looked like. Perhaps they were half-figure portraits, such as became customary later; but they may also have been series of small scenes in which the Chan patriarchs were shown in the circle of their disciples during the official investi- ture of the successor, i.e. a kind of "ordination painting". Two early Japanese versions reflect the type: the copy of the Chuanfa zhengzong dingzu tujuan, the "Illustrated Scroll of the Transmission of the Law in the True School by the Invested Patriarchs", copied by the Japanese monk Jo'en in 1154 after the Chinese original dating to 1061 (Kanchi'in of TOji in Kybto, now at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami) (Fig. 109); and an ink drawing 156 Fig. 107 Half-figure portraits of five Zen masters, by Kichizan Minchf (1351-1431) and biographical inscriptions by GenchO Shugaku (1359-1428), from a set of seven scrolls, dated 1426.

Priest Portraits Priest portraits, dingxiang in Chinese and chinzb in Japanese, - to be distinguished from patriarchs' portraits, zushixiang or soshizb, - are almost always painted in three-quarter profile view facing toward the right or the left. The pure profile does not exist in Zen Buddhist single portraits, the full frontal view only very rarely. Unless required by icono- graphical circumstances, there is no indication of any background. The question of whether the painting is an outdoor or indoor portrait is thus left open, and the attention of the viewer is fully concentrated on the portrayed person. In a few exceptional cases a Zen master is shown in scenic surroundings, e.g., Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) in meditation under a pine tree (No. 26, Figs. 111 -112) or Enni Ben'en (1202-1280) on a rock (No. 27).360 This type of open-air portrait may be considered the most informal kind of Zen Buddhist imagery since it offered the artist opportunities to depart from the strictly predetermined, official portrait formula and to evolve independent artistic ideas. A recorded self-eulogy of the respected Chan master Xiyan Liaohui (1198-1262) for a lost double portrait suggests, that such informal paint- ings may have been given predominantly to laymen, jushi, to generous donors, patrons of the monastery, or fervent admirers of the prelate. In the Xiyan Liaohui Chanshi yulu, published one year after the prelate's death in 1263, it is said that the anonymous recipi- ent of the painting "donated money, sheqian, for the erection of a pavilion at Shendu Monastery", and that "he painted a portrait of the master side by side with his own like- ness, zizhen, his 'true Self', [as they are] relaxing together under a pine tree, and asked [Xiyan Liaohui] for a colophon".361 Perhaps the generous sponsor was a well-to-do artist- friend of the abbot. Such informal open-air pictures reminiscent of elegant literary gath- erings were certainly the most appropriate form of portraiture in the mutual exchange of friendly gifts and favours among illustrious representatives of the Chan clergy and wealthy members of the high society. Xiyan Liaohui who wrote the colophon for a monochrome Shussan Shaka painting in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.,362 came from Pengzhou in Shu, i.e., modern Sichuan Province. At the age of eighteen he received the tonsure, and after extensive studies with leading masters in the renowned eastern med- itation centers of Zhejiang and Jiangsu he headed several Chan institutions of that area. In 1252 he was appointed to one of the most prestigious ecclesiastical positions in the country: abbot in the 39th generation at the Tiantong Jingde Chan Monastery on Mt. Taibai in Qingyuanfu near present day Ningpo. The difference in brushwork, pictorial presentation, and artistic temperament evident between the figure and the landscape elements suggests the hands of two painters in the outdoor portrait of Zhongfeng Mingben at Jishb'in. Joint works, hezuo, of this kind were common during the Yuan Dynasty. The pine and the bamboo, as well as the treat- ment of the rocky ground, are reminiscent of the style of Li Kan (1245-1320), greatly admired by no less a master than Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), as several colophons on Li Kan's bamboo paintings show.363 Moreover, six extant letters by Zhao to Mingben, dat- ing to the years around 1311, clearly document the close personal ties between these two men.364 In addition, we know from a copy of the Qing painter Pan Gongshou (1741 -1794) that Zhao Mengfu painted a portrait of his Chan friend in 1309.365 On impe- rial request, the famous Hanlin scholar was also chosen to compose the text for a memo- rial stele to be erected in the home monastery of the popular prelate on "Heaven's Eye Mountain", Tianmushan, to the west of Hangzhou, when Shiziyuan was renamed Shizizhengzong Chansi, "Chan Monastery of the True School on the Lion's Rock". On the other hand, Zhongfeng Mingben, at the request of Zhao Mengfu, wrote a short philo- sophical essay on the relation between Confucianism as a worldly teaching and Buddhism as an otherworldly teaching entitled Fangqing fuxing, "On Preventing Passion and Recovering Nature". Zhongfeng Mingben was the youngest of seven children of the Sun family in Qiantang in today's Zhejiang Province.366 He is said to have been exceptionally serious-minded 157</page><page sequence="151">W.7, F I .. I "! ~ ~ ~ ~ . * - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4~~~~~~~.1~~~~~~~~~~4J1. pi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~i~~~~~~~j;~~~~ e already as a small boy, to have had a preference for the "lotus seat" position, to have sung Buddhist hymns, and - to the astonishment of the neighbours - to have celebrated Buddhist rituals as children's games. When Mingben was nine years old his mother died, and the highly gifted child left school. Some years later he began to subject himself to rigorous ascetic exercises in addition to the daily routine of a Buddhist lay follower, such as the reciting of holy texts. Often he would climb Mt. Lingdong to meditate alone in the seclusion of nature. Because he wanted to remain awake even at night during his spiri- tual exercises at home, he kept walking around; when he felt drowsy, he would hit his head on the pillars of the house. At the age of fourteen, Mingben sacrificed - following shining examples of the past - a part of his body to the Buddha by burning off the small finger of his left hand. Earlier the second patriarch Huike had severed and sacrificed his arm, and the customs of "burn- ing off a finger", ranzhi, and of inflicting fire scars on the body, shaoba, especially on the chest with sticks of incense, have been practiced by fervent Buddhist monks for cen- turies to the present day.367 Self-mutilation and self-immolation were considered a higher level of religious enthusiasm and devotion. There are frequent references in early Buddhist texts to bodily sacrifices of the Tathagata himself. Stuipas and monasteries were built to commemorate these noble deeds. The learned medieval Buddhist biographer Zanning (919-1001) commented in his introduction to section 7 entitled "Discarding the Body" of his Song gaoseng zhuan with the following verse on this concept of physical self-destruction: To give away the thing that is difficult to part with, Is the best offering among the alms. Let this impure and sinful body, Turn into something like a diamond.368 158 Fig. 111 Head of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) in Meditation under a Pine Tree. Anonymous, first half 14th century. Detail.

Cit. (1982), p. 425. At about the age of twenty, Mingben met the severe master of meditation Gaofeng Yuanmiao (1238-1295) who lived in the inaccessible "Death Pass", Siguan, on top of Mt. Tianmu in modern Zhejiang Province. To his great surprise, the eminent prelate - reputed to be highly dismissive - was immediately willing to accept him as novice. But Mingben's father would not consent and the young man had to content himself with studying as a lay brother under the Chan teacher for three years. In 1287, Mingben finally received ton- sure from Gaofeng Yuanmiao in the "lion's den", the Shizizhengzongsi, "Monastery of the True School on the Lion's Rock", thanks to the support of the pious lady Yang Miaoxi who donated the monk's robes and other paraphernalia. She became such an ardent admirer of the young Chan monk that at home she worshiped some strands of Mingben's hair shaved off at tonsure. After some time the hair allegedly produced lustrous five-coloured ?arira and these are said to have rapidly increased in number. Eleven years after Mingben's death, in the winter of 1334, a stupa was built at the "Cloud Abode", the Yunju'an near Hangzhou, to house the Chan master's miraculous hair together with the venerated relics that had grown from it. Two years after receiving the tonsure, Zhongfeng Mingben had already attained enlight- enment. In order to celebrate and to certify this attainment Gaofeng Yuanmiao gave him a portrait of himself with the following eulogy: My face is inconceivable, Even Buddhas and patriarchs cannot have a glimpse, / allow this no-good son alone To have a peep at half of my nose.369 Mingben remained in the monastery until 1295, serving in a number of various monastic offices. But he felt increasingly constricted and limited by the obligations of monastic life. When his master felt death approaching he asked Zhongfeng Mingben to assume the leadership of the newly-erected "Monastery of the Great Enlightenment", Dajuesi, built on "Lotus Blossom Peak", Lianhuafeng, of western Mt. Tianmu with the help of a wealthy patron. Mingben, however, declined and suggested another disciple as successor. After the funeral of his master, he left Tianmushan and began a free, restless life of roaming about more suited to his eccentric, individualistic character and his craving for personal independence. Mingben wanted to be a true mendicant. From 1298 onwards, he erected a number of hermitages which he often called Huanzhu'an, "Illusory Abode". Repeatedly, he rejected honourable calls to direct renowned Chan institutions. In 1304, he settled near the grave of his teacher Gaofeng Yuanmiao, and a year later, urged by the authori- ties and his ever-increasing flock of disciples, Mingben accepted the abbacy of his old home monastery on Mt. Tianmu. In 1309, he retired to a house boat in Yizhen, Jiangsu Province. He was recalled to Tianmushan in the following year, but in 1311 he eschewed all clerical obligations again and withdrew to a boat on Wujiang, a river flowing into the "Great Lake", Taihu. Subsequently, he tried to live incognito in various places, avoiding official summonings. Despite high courtly honours and titles, and despite a large number of devoted disciples who kept tracking him down, shunning no difficulties or dangers in their efforts to receive religious instruction from the master, Zhongfeng Mingben could not be persuaded to live in a monastery for any extended time until an advanced age. Repeatedly, he spurned prestigious appointments and even an audience with the Emperor. At the bottom of his heart, he was an individualist and a hermit. Again and again, he vanished into small, idyllic hermitages and returned only sporadically to his home monastery as well as to a Huanzhu'an on western Mt. Tianmu built for him in 1317 by a lay adherent called Jiang Jun. Not until the age of fifty-five did Mingben reconcile himself to the fact that he had to take on the burden of an abbacy: in 1318, he started shaving his head again in accord- ance with monastic custom (Fig. 113). This change of his outer appearance may also have had something to do with the monastic behaviour codex Huanzhu qinggui, the "Pure Rules from the Huanzhu[an]" written down in the previous year and meant not so much as generally binding order rules, but rather as a practical manual for his own circle of disciples. He died in 1323 at the relatively early age of sixty. 159</page><page sequence="153">} [ ~*; Ww&gt;;t | i | ::i~~~~~~llglE-E~~~~il 1 t~~ I__ty I_ n t - _ , , s~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i_ - | . l tw~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I _ _- _I_ 4 1? i _ IJ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SI _ ?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 160 Fig 113 Portrait of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323), by Yi'an (active around 1300), before 1315.

For Zen practitioners in his line gong'an as regular part of instruction came to represent the true essence of meditative vocation. The master himself called gong'an a "senseless and tasteless phrase", wuyiwei huatou, which was made up to stop the adept's excessive intellectual approach and to artificially create the "great doubt", dayi. He left behind a number of ser- mons, individual didactic sayings, commentaries to Buddhist texts, essays, poems, let- ters, and painting inscriptions compiled by a disciple in the Zhongfeng Heshang guanglu as well as a three-part supplementary volume. Among the extant portraits of Zen priests, those showing a priest as abbot seated in cathedra are by far the most numerous. Preferred representational formula for contem- poraneous priests' portraits, juz6, but also for posthumous effigies, izd, painted soon after the death of the master, is the "portrait on the chair", isuz6, showing the master with folded legs in the so-called kekkafuza position on an abbot's chair with arm rests and, often, a high back rest. This dignified posture is most common in the official type of chinz6. In front of the abbot's chair, kyokuroku, often covered by a richly ornamented, precious textile, happi, the shoes, kutsu, stand on a low foot-stool, fumidoko. In his hands resting in his lap, the master usually holds a flywhisk, hossu, or an admonishing staff, a shipped or a kydsaku (also keisaku), used to dispense well-meant blows on the shoulders of disciples, furthering their concentration during zazen. In contrast, half-figure portraits, hanshinzd, painted during the lifetime of the respective master and conceived from the beginning as individual portraits, are relatively rare. Sometimes, they can be found set in a circle, ensdzd, so that the portrayed Zen master appears to be encircled by a halo and the portrait is reminiscent of a mirror image. Ikkyu Sbjun (1394-1481) especially liked to be portrayed this way (No. 30, Fig. 21). The dedi- cation for his disciple Soshin Sho'etsu (Tamagaki Koji, 1441 -1519) on the double portrait with his blind paramour Mori at the Masaki Bijutsukan begins with a statement about the "Great Circle", dai'ens6. Evidently, Ikkyu recognizes in the round portrait his true Self as a mirror-image of his revered Chinese ancestor Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269), with whom he identified himself in other portraits to the extent of giving up his own outer appearance. Three portraits, dated 1462, 1464, and 1468 and inscribed by himself, as well as a fourth, undated version at the Idemitsu Bijutsukan in Tokyo, show Ikkyui assuming the exterior appearance of his Chinese model (Fig. 114).370 Ultimately, the circle symbolizes the true nature of all creatures, the "primordial countenance before birth" revealed in the round mirror of perfect wisdom. With the elevation of the portrayed master in the round halo, and with the reflection of his innermost nature, the ensbzd assumes the character of a "pathos formula". The inscribed eulogies (Chin. zan, Jap. san), usually added in the upper third of the paint- ing, i.e., above the head of the portrayed master, are an integral part of the chinzo. In the case of contemporaneous portraits, they were composed and written on the scroll by the master himself (Chin. zizan, Jap. ]isan), not rarely upon the request of his disciples, con- freres, lay adherents, or patrons. Yuanwu Keqin (1063-1135), the famous compiler of the "Blue Cliff Record", wrote no less than twenty eulogies for an ardent admirer which are listed in his "Recorded Sayings" under the heading: "A Chan adherent had portraits, zhen, [of me] painted and begged me to inscribe them. Twenty poems."371 In all likelihood Yuanwu was portrayed on twenty hanging scrolls. One of these inscriptions begins with the critical statement: "The dao does not consist in the reds and greens [of this portrait]; nor does [the true nature of] Chan come alive in the features of this face".372 The 25th Jingshan abbot Mi'an Hanjie (1107-1186), who headed the Lingyinsi in the 18th and the Tiantongsi in the 21st generation, wrote on one of his portraits a dedication upon the request of a "great layman", dajushi, by the name of Zhang Zhige with the Buddhist sobri- quet Yuezhai, "Frugal Fasting".373 In the "Recorded Sayings" of the eminent Chan mas- ter Dachuan Puji (1179-1 253) we find a colophon for a certain Mu Zhige with the religious name Yuetang, "Hall of Happiness", who had a portrait of the 37th prelate of Lingyinsi and 38th of Jingcisi painted and inscribed by the master. The eulogy opens like a piece of pure nature lyrics with evoking images of seasonal charm and beauty: 161</page><page sequence="155">Spring water fills the four marsh-lands. Summer clouds abound over marvelous peaks. Autumn moon spreads its shining brightness. Wintry mountain ranges adorn a solitary pine-tree.374 Another recorded inscription by Dachuan Puji alludes to a famous Zen encounter: the dialogue between Governor Li Ao (died ca.844) and the Chan master Yaoshan Weiyan (751-834), whose "mountain name" seems to suggest a punning association with the dedicatee's almost identical Buddhist sobriquet Leshan, also pronounced Yaoshan. The eulogy is preceded by the statement: "The layman Wang [with the spiritual name] "Mountain of Happiness", Leshan, from Changxi in Fuzhou sent his son to sponsor the master's tonsure, tifa. He had a portrait, dingxiang, of the master painted and asked him for an inscription on it. "375Wealthy patrons of monasteries and secular admirers of extra- ordinary Chan monks often donated the robes and other costly implements to indirectly partake in the reception of tonsure. The 34th Jingshan abbot Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) gave his formal chinzo in 1238 to one of his brightest followers, the thirty-six-year-old Japanese pilgrim monk Enni Ben'en (1202-1280) (Fig. 117). In response to the expressed wish of his advanced disciple Wuzhun Shifan wrote the following eulogy above his head on the hanging scroll which has been treasured at Tbfukuji in Kybto:376 The Great Song Empire and the Japanese Empire - The heaven is without boundaries and the earth has no poles. With one sentence he settles a thousand errors. Is there anyone else who can distinguish between wrong and right? He startles the "worm with the white forehead' bai'ehui, from "South Mountain" Nanshan, So that an exceedingly clear breeze makes him grow feathers and wings. The "Honorable Elder" zhanglao (Jap. chorb), of Kunc3zan] in Japan [i.e., Enni Ben'en] had this illusory image of my [Self] painted and asked me for an inscription. In the mid-summer of the wuxu [year] of the Jiaxi [era, 1238, written by] the old monk Wuzhun [Shifan] residing on the Great Song [Dynasty's] Mt. Jing. "Paraph" (Chin. huaya, Jap. ka'o). At the beginning the author praises the limitless promulgation of Zen. Bai'ehui is a typi- cally self-pejorative epithet which was more frequently used in Daoist writings. The Chan monastery on Nanshan near Hangzhou is the Jingcisi where Wuzhun Shifan had received part of his own religious education and monastic training. He seems to have been deeply impressed by the discerning insights of his guest student from Mt. Kuno in the old province of Suruga, present-day Shizuoka Prefecture. Some of these eulogies, mostly composed as verses and rhymed, are of such a personal nature, or allude to the rela- tionship between the master and the dedicatee in enigmatic images and metaphors so veiled as to be only partially comprehensible for the uninitiated. A number of recorded early self-eulogies on portraits employ wordplays with the character zhen, the meaning of which oscillates between "true" or "genuine" and "portrait". They sometimes question the validity of portraiture altogether. How can the genuine nature and character of a per- son be "truly" reflected in a mirror image of his outer appearance, and how can his "true" Self be captured by colour and ink in a likeness? An early example of a dedicatory inscrip- tion on a lost portrait is the one by the Chan prelate Huanglong Huinan (Jap. Oryo E'nan, 1002-1069). It illuminates the circumstances of production of such paintings and at the same time shows the partly critical and even skeptical attitude of many masters of med- itation toward the practice of inscribing one's own images. The abbot of the monastery on the "Yellow Dragon Mountain", Huanglongshan in Jiangxi Province, whose Rinzai doc- trine was introduced to Japan by MyOan Eisai (1141 -1215), writes: A Chan adherent had a picture painted of my true Self, wu zhen, and asked me to write a eulogy, zan, for it. Alas, misshapen as the painting already is, the eulogy will most likely end up to be even more nonsensical. But as I cannot evade his insistent begging, I shall accede to his wish [and write]: This one scroll of white silk and red and blue stripes then is supposed to be a portrait of me, wu zhi zhen, I am told, - when in fact it is a robber of myself! My true Self, wu zhen, cannot be captured by forms, my shape cannot be revealed in this way. [Thus, I 162 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Z _j * Fig. 116 Portrait of Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249).

The trees of my hometown stood on "Jade Mountain" Yushan, and my secular name was Zhang.377 The notion that a portrait was condemned to fail from its inception in capturing the true Self of the sitter was also a favourite topic of the eloquent Chan master Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323). In one of his self-eulogies he played with the phrase wujian ding- xiang, "the invisible portrait", by writing: One does not use color [in depicting] the invisible ting-hsiang [dingxiang]; what need is there to hang up [the portrait] when everything is [already] fully manifest?378 Zen masters wrote their dedications in both directions on the portraits, from right to left as well as, contrary to general convention in East Asia, from left to right. The direction of the san was predetermined by the line of sight of the portrayed master, since the inscrip- tion begins usually on that side of the painting which the subject of the portrait is facing. This is also the case in most other Zen Buddhist figure paintings. We owe to the Chinese master of meditation Zhuxian Fanxian (Jap. Jikusen Bonsen, 1292-1348) a most revealing commentary concerning the representational principles of contemporaneous and posthumous Zen portraits. He was active in Japan as of 1329, making himself a name not only as teacher and abbot of important monasteries, but also as a renowned master of writing and painting. In the "Colophon to the Proper Facing Direction in Portraiture", Ba dingxiang chaoxiang suoyi, of his "Heavenly Pillar Collection", Tianzhuji, transmitted in his "Recorded Sayings", he argues against the rule - evidently a traditional custom already during the Yuan Dynasty - according to which a master who was portrayed prior to his death always had to face toward the right, while a posthumous portrait was supposed to show the master in three-quarter profile looking toward the left: Everyone painting the portrait, dingxiang/chinzo, of a master of our school should let [the subject] face toward west [i.e., left]. Some maintain that when it is painted while [the por- trayed master] is still alive it should look toward east [i.e., right]. Such words should not be listened to.379 In Japan, too, learned Zen monks, such as Mujaku Dochu (1653-1744) in chapter 5 of his Zenrin shbkisen completed in 1741, vehemently opposed this request for the differ- entiation of contemporaneous and posthumous portraits, as well as the related condi- tion that the inscription has to run toward the line of sight of the portrayed subject. Nevertheless, most painters of such portraits complied with the injunction, as the volu- minous body of extant works confirms.380 As a rule, posthumous portraits, izd, were inscribed by disciples or successors of the portrayed master from left to right, i.e., opposed to the customary way of writing. Many of them were commissioned by the monastery or the deceased's successor during the 49 days of mourning immediately fol- lowing the master's death, since chinzd played an important part in the funeral cere- monies, sbgi or soshiki, and in the rituals commemorating the death day, shuki. The most important extant chinzb were created from the thirteenth to the fifteenth cen- turies. The subjects of three of the best works of all Chinese portrait painting presented their inscribed portraits to Japanese disciples. In 1238, the great prelate of Mt. Jing, Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), dedicated his portrait to Enni Ben'en (1202-1280), who returned to Japan in 1241 and became founding abbot of Tofukuji in Kybto in 1255 (Fig. 117). This precious scroll has been kept and revered at Tbfukuji from the thirteenth cen- tury to this day. From as early as the fourteenth century, it was copied many times (Fig. 116) and parts of it were closely imitated in other paintings. The anonymous painter who portrayed the Tbfukuji abbot Chikotsu Dai'e (1229-1 31 2) in 1301 on the impressive scroll at Ganjbji must have known it exactly, adopting as he did all the strong and weak points of the Chinese model (No. 24, Fig. 118). He made use of the elegant line vocabulary of the Song artist, espoused his overall composition, but encountered the same difficulties in the attempt to find a convincing organic connection between the seated figure in three- quarter profile and the perspectivally rendered chair. Although he took into account the broad-shouldered posture and the individual, almost aggressive facial features of the 163</page><page sequence="157">-. n*. . L ' Ng t~ ~ ~~-- lp-~~ 4j ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~A stern Zen master and changed the colour scheme, he took over the basic lines of the body as well as of the abbot's chair quite faithfully. This is especially striking when com- paring certain expressive details, such as the unusually spread fingers of the left hand or the drapery of the chair cover and the garment, especially on the left side where even the mannered flourish above the chair's rear leg has been copied with startling similarity. The close affinity between the two portraits is not immediately noticeable, since the overall effect of the two effigies as well as the aura of the two Zen masters - evidently as differ- ent in their outer appearance as in their character - are quite disparate due to their extremely different faces.

Kybto - to a Japanese disciple, Senpo Honryu of Jomyoji in Kamakura;381 and in 1315, the pilgrim monk Enkei Soyu (1 285-1344) returned from a nine-year sojourn in China with a portrait of his master Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) signed by an otherwise un- known painter by the name of Yi'an (Fig. 113).382 In his old home province Tanba, Enkei erected Kogenji in 1325, where the magnificent painting of the corpulent, long-haired Chan master has remained to this day. The number of Japanese chinzd is vast, and only a few of the most important portraits of eminent masters, such as Enni Ben'en, Chikotsu Dai'e, Muso Soseki, or Ikkyui Sbjun can be mentioned. It is striking, however, that some masters of meditation were often portrayed while still alive, whereas of others there seem to be no contemporaneous images at all. In contrast to his master Muso Soseki and his older friend Shun'oku Myoha (1311 -1388), the gozan poet Gido Shuishin (1325-1388) is not known to us through any portrait painted during his lifetime. Evidently, he does not seem to have been interested in being portrayed as he reports - with unworldly distance and delicate puns on his literati name Kucge Dbjin - in an encounter with an otherwise unknown artist: The portrait painter monk Kosei [Dorin] passed by my gate and asked if he could paint a "Portrait of Kuge" [Gido]. Refusing, I said jokingly, "This mountain priest's elusive face is like 'blossoms in the air' [kuge] -just as they are revealed they are annihilated. Where do you propose to begin painting that?" The monk laughed, "I'll start with the 'revealing and annihilating' part." I laughed and wrote this poem in thanks: There could never be an accurate portrait of "blossoms in the air" [i.e., "Flower of the Void"] - When the visage is done, it won't be a true likeness; Put down your brush and look again closely: It's in the blank space of the background that the figure materializes.383 In this episode, Gido Shuishin emphasizes that ultimately the true nature of a personality and the essence of Zen literally embodied by that person cannot be rendered by even the best of portraits; that the "transmission of the mind by the mind", ishin denshin, is an invisible process attaining form in the empty void of the ground, "materializing in the blank space of the background" since it transcends the limits of the human capacity of per- ception and image-making. Gido may have selected his sobriquet Kuge, "Blossoms in the Air", because he suffered like Yishan Yining from an annoying eye disease through- out his life. His blurred vision was probably due to a cataract. In a positive Zen percep- tion, the term can also mean "flower of the void". In Buddhist parlance the phrase was employed as a pertinent metaphor for the delusion of those who have eye trouble and cannot see things in their true appearance. Kuge is the title of the twelfth chapter in Dbgen's (1200-1253) Shobdgenzd, "Eye-Treasury of the True Dharma". There we read: Once Shjkyamuni said, "If people have eye disease, their vision is faulty and they see a flower in the sky. This flower is kuge." One interpretation of this is that "eye disease" here means an upside down viewpoint; consequently, the flower appears misshapen. If this is not clarified a flower may be seen where none exists. If eye disease is cured kuge can no longer be seen. It is truly regrettable that many people do not know the meaning and circumstances of kuge. It cannot be grasped by ordinary people or non-believers but Buddhas always strive to clarify kuge.384 In harmony with Dbgen, Gido Shushin developed the idea that even deceptive visions may be aspects of true enlightenment, "that his deceptive eyes kept pointing up the illu- sory nature of what others accepted as 'reality', and wrote the following Zen poem on his name" :385 Emptiness without form, Flowers without fruit - Only those who can see these May enter my temple. 165</page><page sequence="159">The master's negative attitude toward the art of portraiture may have been a reaction to the beginnings of an all too inflationary evaluation of chinzo as official seals of succes- sion in the authentic line of tradition, as well as to the self-glorifying prestige-seeking deportment of some of Muso's disciples. Gido wanted to "point to an intrinsic contra- diction by definition inherent in every portrait attempting to reflect the 'true' nature of a person. It is therefore doomed to failure before it is begun, just like any self-characteri- zation trying to re-enact in words what the brush already failed to accomplish".386 This critical reservation was deeply rooted in Zen thought and history. Though probably lack- ing historical value, there is an anecdotal reference found in the biography of the wise Chan master Zhaozhou Congshen (778-897), which Daoyuan included in his hagiologi- cal "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007]": There was a [painter-]monk who painted a true [likeness], zhen, of the master and pre- sented it to him. The master said: "Now, tell me, does this resemble me or does it not resemble me? If it resembles me, then immediately kill the old monk. If it does not re- semble me, then immediately get rid of the portrait, zhen, and burn it." The monk had nothing to reply.387 What Zhaozhou Congshen tried to convey in his dialogue with the anonymous painter- monk was the message, that even the most genuine and original likeness cannot replace the corporeal substance and lively presence of a enlightened master of meditation. Yuanwu Keqin (1063-1135) also felt reluctant to accept portraits as substitutes for the actual presence of religious teachers. Nevertheless, he left more than forty self-eulogies on portraits though partly of sceptic content, and he could not hide his curiosity con- cerning the artistic interpretation of his personality in his visibly mirrored image. When Yuanwu Keqin was asked by an acolyte, shizhe, named Jingyuan to inscribe his portrait he composed a rather disillusionized eulogy which has been transmitted in chapter 20 of his "Recorded Sayings", Yuanwu Foguo Chanshi yulu: All my life, I have preached meditation, chan, for slow-witted heads, And have run against them with my writings as against an iron wall. I have tried to do away with the interwoven-entangled [errors] and to cut them off at the roots, And I have tried to gather everywhere only the black of ink and lacquer for me. In my later years, as time passed by, I either succumbed to melancholy, Or I wanted to raise the [diamond-like vajra] thunderbolt, jin'gang, to destroy the nests and holes [of the heretics]. But one day, I was seized by the urge to get to know the countenance of this Yuanwu, And somebody [as painter of this face] has conjured it up for me in all its details. 388 According to Donald Keene, medieval Japanese portraitists usually drew about six or seven sketches in front of the living model, submitting them to their subject for approval.389 If none of the drawings appealed to the sitter, he would request a new selec- tion; if the sketches were still not to his satisfaction, he had the right to change the artist. The only reason for rejection of a sketch given in medieval sources is the lack of resem- blance. This suggests that not only did the sketches extant today earn the approval of the sitters, but also that the priests are portrayed with great similitude. An impressive document of this kind is the portrait sketch at Rikkyoku'an in Kybto show- ing Haku'un Egyo (1228-1298), the founder of this cloister established within Tbfukuji in 1294 (No. 23)390 Most likely the sketch was drawn while the fourth abbot of Tbfukuji was still alive and no doubt it did serve as a model for a number of other portraits later on. It seems to have been a custom among medieval portrait painters to draw portrait sketches of only the face or of the shoulders with the head, almost exclusively in three-quarter pro- file. About two hundred years after the anonymous Haku'un Egyo sketch, the painter- monk Bokusai (1412?-1492) also painted his master lkkyui Sbjun (1394-1481) in a some- what more elaborate draft following the same model (No. 31). It is safe to assume that on the basis of this outstanding study - evidently approved by the irritable Zen abbot - a number of official portraits of the "Master of the Crazy Cloud", Kybunshi, as he liked to call himself, were painted (Fig. 115). 166 386 Bauer: op. cit.

Paintings of Zen Encounters A specifically Zen Buddhist type of painting is the so-called zenkizu, "Paintings of Zen Events or Zen Actions". The category has also been called "Zen assistance paintings" since the narrative painting scenes, originally often lined up in handscroll format, but also occurring on individual hanging scrolls, endeavour to offer help and encouragement to the disciple. They did this by showing examples of fundamental themes of Zen trans- mission, decisive events in the life of a paradigmatic Zen patriarch, or encounters and dialogues between enlightened, worthy masters of meditation and representatives of other intellectual milieus. Zenkizu are somewhat like the original redemptive literature, Erbauungsliteratur, in Christian antiquity and the Middle Ages, and in that sense they can be interpreted as "edifying or encouragement paintings", and by extension as "Zen as- sistance paintings". The titles of many of these scenes contain the compound mondd, literally "question and answer". In Zen Buddhist writings, these "dialogue paintings", characterized by a strong historical, narrative component, are called chanhui tu or zen'e zu, "paintings of Zen encounters". The selection of such themes appears to have been subject to a certain sys- tematic approach as early as the thirteenth century, since the "Recorded Sayings", yulu or goroku, of renowned Zen masters often contain twelve or thirteen illustrated episodes in the same, or at least in a similar, order. Such cycles often begin with the story of the Chan priest Huangbo Xiyun (died around 850) who answered the challenging question of a young monk by hitting him three times in the face; later, the novice treated so harshly became the seventeenth Emperor of the Tang Dynasty under the name of Xuanzong (reigned 846-859). Another typical Zen encounter describes the visit of the high official Li Ao (died ca. 844) to the Chan master Yaoshan Weiyan (751 -834). One of the sources where the story can be found is the Jingde chuandeng lu, the "Record of the Transmission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007].391 The meeting is also recorded in the "Original Assembly of the Five Flames", Wudeng huiyuan, completed by the 37th abbot of Lingyinsi, Dachuan Puji (1179-1253), in 1252.392 When the Confucianist Li Ao, Governor of Langzhou and friend of the famous Han Yu (768-824), restorer of the Tang Dynasty's political and cul- tural fortunes and an anti-Buddhist, asked Yaoshan Weiyan for instruction, Yaoshan at first ignored the illustrious guest. Thus provoked, Li Ao grew impatient and blurted out: "Seeing you face-to-face is not as exciting as hearing about your great reputation." Yaoshan Weiyan replied calmly: "Would you trust what you hear rather than what you see?" Impressed, Li Ao bowed and asked: "Which is the [right] way [toward enlighten- ment]?" Yaoshan answered by pointing upwards with one hand and downwards with the other. But Li Ao did not understand the strange gesture supposed to indicate that the ultimate reality is what you have in front of your eyes. So finally the Chan master added: "The clouds are in the sky; the water is in the vase." Now, Li Ao grasped the master's meaning and spontaneously recited the following verse: His ascetic body is parched like that of a crane. Under myriads of pines are two sutra boxes. When / came to ask the way [of enlightenment] he only said: "The clouds are in the sky; the water is in the vase." Two outstanding extant works show this scene. Dating to the Song Dynasty, they are styl- istically opposite and thus prime examples of the extreme poles of Zen Buddhist paint- ing. One of them bears in its lower right the signature of Ma Gongxian, according to Zhuang Su's Huaji buyi, "Supplement to 'Painting' Continued", of 1298, a grandson of Ma Yuan and thus active during the thirteenth century and not in the middle of the twelfth century as some standard sources maintain. The hanging scroll at Nanzenji in Kyoto (No. 15, Fig. 119), painted in light colours on silk using a lucid, linear composition, shows Li Ao in his official's garb and with his hands reverently held together in front of his chest. He is standing by a large table of natural stone slabs behind which the emaciated old Yaoshan Weiyan is seated on a bamboo chair under a huge pine tree. His hands are in the telltale gesture and his face is full of laughter. On the table in front of the Chan mas- 167</page><page sequence="161">wn,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~s S,4~~~~~~~~* W-nS: - ~ i W *-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ter there is a plum branch in a long-necked round vase; beside it are two book scroll boxes, an open, oval ink stone, and a small cup. In contrast to this work, indebted to the academic tradition and rendering the painting's content in poignant, descriptive terms, the anonymous painter of a version at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, harks back to the suggestive potential of delicate ink lines and watery, grey washes in loose, unfettered simplicity (Fig. 120). The work is now mounted as a hanging scroll, but was most likely part of a handscroll originally. It bears an inscription by the Chan abbot Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263), written during his abbacy at Lingyinsi between 1254 and 1256 when he resided at Lengquan: The moment of enlightenment comes in a flash, Why do we mistrust what we see and value what we hear? Do not say there is no truth Between the water and the clouds! Guangwen, living at Lengquan.393 Another encounter often taken up by painters tells us about the dialogue between the Chan patriarch Mazu Daoyi (709-788) and the hermit Pang Yun, who is sometimes iden- tified with Vimalakirti.394 The layman Pang once asked the enlightened master: "What kind of a man is he who does not accompany a myriad of things?" This question seems to have been of great importance to the hermit, since he had confronted another master of meditation, Shitou Xiqian (700-790), with the same query. Shitou had reacted by silently holding his hand over the inquisitive layman's mouth. Mazu Daoyi promised an answer on an impossible condition by replying: "I shall respond if you can drink all the water in the West River in one gulp!" In the sense of Zen, the liberation from one's attach- ment to all things of this world is utter depletion, inexpressible in words, leading in the end to a condition of absolute enlightenment; thus, any attempt to answer Pang Yun's question would already be a hopeless relapse into the entanglement of analytical, logi- cally discursive thinking, into the dependence on theories and words. This is why Shitou 168 Fig. 119 The Chan Master Yaoshan Weiyan in Con- versation with the Governor Li Ao, by Ma Gongxian (active 13th century). Detail. Nanzenji, Kyoto (No. 15, Photo H.B.). 393 Cf.

The painting at Tenju in of Myoshinji shows Mazu Daoyi as a dig- nified abbot on his chair flanked by two acolytes (No 16) In front of the wise Chan mas ter of the Tang Dynasty, Pang Yun is reverently kneeling, marked by his official's cap as representative of the secular world. The bald-headed monks on the empty ground of the painting are characterized by composed calmness and inner repose, while the face of the hermit seems to betray pensive bewilderment over the cryptic dialogue. The inscrip- tion dated to 1325 is by Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339). One year before his depar- ture for Japan, he dedicated the eulogy and probably the painting to an advanced, most likely Japanese disciple by the name of Don'an [?]shun who occupied the "chief seat", shuso, of the Monks' Hall at Zhenjingsi. This disciple may well have brought the scroll to Japan at an early date. 12. Parables and Allegories The last category of the zenkizu, the "parable paintings", at first reveal their paradigmatic character as little as the representations of typical Zen dialogues. Especially popular was the "Oxherding" theme, verbally and pictorially alluding to the various possible stages on the way toward enlightenment.395 When in 1395 the Ashikaga Shbgun Yoshimitsu re- quested that Zekkai Ch~shin (1336-1406) expound the fundamental tenets of Zen Buddhism for him, the master used the parable, existing in various versions as a series of poems and paintings, in his lectures to the regent. The famous story's main role was to help ease the way toward insight into the true nature of things in stages, usually ten, ]OgyOzu, with the simile of the herdboy who has "lost" the animal in his care; searches for it laboriously; and finally finds it again. It may well be that for Yoshimitsu's instruction Zekkai Ch'shin used the famous set of prose lines - most likely accompanied by ten paintings originally - with explicatory poems in carefully written "regular script", kaisho, now mounted as ten hanging scrolls extant at Shbkokuji in Kybto (No. 41, Fig. 121). At least the precious, imported paper, sumptuously decorated in a batik-like technique, rc~sen, and possibly brought back from China by Zekkai Ch~shin in 1376 after an eight- year sojourn on the continent, would indicate use in aristocratic circles. The influential Zen abbot Zekkai Choshin sprang from the Tsuno family, a branch of the Fujiwara clan, in Tosa, today's Kbchi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. At the age of twelve, he entered Tenrysji in Kywto, receiving tonsure in 1350. Zekkai Choshin was instructed by Musc Soseki whom he followed to Saihbji. After the death of his revered teacher, he moved to Kenninji in 1353. There he studied, together with Gido ShTshin, for more than a decade, especially the fundamental principles of Chinese prose and poetry under the 35th abbot Ryzan Tokken (1 284-1358). Tokken in turn had thoroughly famil- iarized himself with Chinese literature, above all with gdthm poetry or the gebu style, under the master Gulin Qingmao (1262-1329) during his sojourn in China.

At this occasion, the Emperor wrote a poem for his Japanese guest as a return gift for a verse Zekkai Chushin had given to him. Shortly thereafter, Zekkai Chushin, by now forty years old, set out on his home journey. After landing at Hakata, he travelled on to Kybto and was joyfully received by his old friend Gido Shushin. In 1379 he entered Tenryuji as the responsible occupant of the chief seat for the monks in the front part of the Meditation Hall, zendc shuso, under the 17th abbot Shbkai Reiken (1315-1396). Disappointed by the prestige fights among the Muso heirs, Zekkai Chushin retired and settled in 1380 as prelate of Erinji in Kai, today's Yamanashi Prefecture. Three years later, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu appointed him back to Kybto into the Rokuon'in of Shbkokuji; but already in the following year, the two men had a falling-out and the Zen master was banished from the capital. When the Shbgun regretted his thoughtless decision, Gido Shushin was finally able to prevail upon his old friend to return to the capital and assume the abbacy of Tojiji, the tutelary temple of the Ashikaga fam- ily. When Gido died in 1388, the task to keep alive the spiritual heritage of Muso Kokushi and to continue the literary tradition of gozan fell to Zekkai Chushin alone. He regained the trust of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, who appointed him sixth abbot of Shbkokuji in 1392. Twice he retired from the abbacy of the monastery, only to be appointed back - in 1397 as well as in 1401 - to the prestigious post in which he had, as head of all gozan institu- tions in the country, scroku, immense administrative obligations. At the third appointment of Zekkai Chushin, the Shbgun honoured the eminent Zen master by ranking Shokokuji at the top of the "Five Mountains" in the capital. Zekkai Chushin died on the fifth day of the fourth month 1405 at the age of sixty-nine. In various monasteries in Kybto, tomb pagodas were erected, and the Imperial House bestowed several honorific titles on him posthumously, among them the title Butchi Kcshc Kokushi, "National Master of the Spreading Light of the Buddha Truth". The parable of the ox and his herdboy played an especially important part in the intro- ductory instruction of disciples and lay followers of meditational Buddhism. One of the pioneers of Zen, the Chinese master Wuxue Zuyuan (Jap. Mugaku Sogen, 1226-1286), active in Japan from 1279 until his death, had already instructed a pilgrim along the same lines when he acceded to the latter's request for a poem and alluded to the parable of the ox and its herdboy: The Buddha is just an old monk in the Western Heaven - Is that something to look so hard for day and night? It's you who are the Buddha, but you just won't see - Why go riding on an ox to search for an ox?!396 Most likely, what Mugaku Sogen had in mind was the famous dialogue between Baizhang Huaihai (720-814) and Changqing Da'an, recorded in Dachuan Puji's (1179-1253) Wudeng huiyuan, the "Original Assembly of the Five Flames", dating to 1252. In his fruit- less struggle for enlightenment, Changqing in his confusion turned to the master Baizhang and asked: "I am in search of the Buddha, but I do not yet know how to con- tinue my quest." Baizhang: "It is as if one were looking for a ox on which one is riding." Changing: "What is a man supposed to do when he knows this?" Baizhang: "It is as if one returned home on the back of a ox. 397 The first "Painting Sets of the Oxherding" Parable, muniutu, seem to have their origin in China around the middle of the eleventh century.398 In the series designed by Dabai Puming (11 th century?), the steps of the Zen way are symbolized in ten stages by an ox turning from a jet-black animal to a gradually lighter one, becoming a snow white beast that turns completely invisible in the end, showing in logical conclusion an empty circle symbolizing the absolute deliverance from any adherence to the world of phenomena.399 In a monumental relief cycle hewn into the rock and measuring about 4.5 m in height and 27 m in length, the parable was included - probably with didactic intent - among the Buddhist themes selected by the head of the grandiose project, the Buddhist monk Zhao Zhifeng (1159-ca.1240) from Dazu, when he began with the construction of the "Great Buddha Curve", Dafowan, at Mt. Baoding in Sichuan Province.

In it, the stages on the way toward the highest insight are introduced by the following similes, accompanied here by the concise, excellent comments by Dietrich Seckel:401 1. The bewildered anxious search of the herdsman for his lost buffalo fiingyG] (meaning that craving and fear arise from ignorance about the true nature of the world); 2. He discovers its footprints [kenseki] (the beginning of the insight, through the study of the teaching, so that man can discover the path leading to the truth at least from a distance); 3. He sees the buffalo [kengyG] (insight into the essence of things and of his own self which are both essentially the same); 4. Catching the ox [tokugyG] (the resisting power of the world of phenomena which has to betamed); 5. Leading the buffalo by a rope [bokugyQ] (the truth, now securely grasped, can no longer be lost as the result of illusion); 6. Riding home on the back of the buffalo [kigyG kika], who walks freely and securely, accompanied by the herdsman playing the flute (the sure, joyous quietude of enlight- enment; everything happening spontaneously); 7. Having forgotten the buffalo, he is alone at home [bogyG sonjin] (a consciously for- mulated "insight" has now become superfluous; since the desired essential stage has been reached, the ontological transformation has been accomplished); 8. Both buffalo and man disappear [ningyG gubb], an empty circle remains (meaning all duality has been dissolved in the ultimate clarity; "everything is empty"); 9. Return to the origin [henpon gengen]; blossoms at a stream (the simple existence of things; there is no longer a need to speculate over the essence of their existence); 10. Strolling through the market [nitten suishu] (in the unassuming figure of Pu-tai [Budail: free from desire, joyous, beyond the world, not flaunting his wisdom, the enlightened man mingles with the people, all of whom will reach Buddhahood). From one of the early "Oxherding" sets, four paintings are known to us, one of them in the form of a Kano copy of 1675.402 Already in that copy, the small, square hanging scrolls are attributed to Li Song (active ca.1190-1230). Although one may doubt this traditional attribution, the scenes, composed with light washes in a circle, bespeak the hand of a talented Song painter, and the probably authentic inscriptions by the Chan monk Shaolin Miaosong, 29th abbot of Jingcisi and as 33rd abbot on Jingshan predecessor of Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), allow a dating of the series to the first third of the thirteenth century (Fig. 122). About one hundred years later - according to reliable sources - the Japanese painter-monk Muto Shui, to whom we owe the magnificent half-figure portrait of his Zen master Muso Soseki (1275-1351) at Mybchi'in in Kybto, painted a now-lost "Oxherding" series. It must have been an extremely important work, since shortly before his death, Muso handed it - with a title inscription by his own hand - to the young ex-Emperor Suko (1334-1398) who had reigned only for three years (1349-1351) and resided subsequently at Kbmyb'in. In 1382, the handscroll moved the experienced Zen literatus and art con- noisseur Gido Shushin (1325-1388) to two entries in his diary, the Kuge nikki shQ.403 Among the long-standing treasures of Shokokuji in Kyoto is a handscroll containing a complete series of ten round paintings showing the parable of the ox and the herdboy, traditionally attributed to the famous Zen painter-monk Shubun (active ca.1423-1460) (No. 18). The composition and certain stylistic features no doubt have their origin in one or several printed Guo'an versions. A]jugyuzu handscroll kept at Hoshun'in of Daitokuji 171</page><page sequence="165">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~sIk ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. was probably painted after =51ial simia model Jaaes.colr .paeititoteinta In~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ phase of the Kano school, i.e., the fifteenth century.404 The "Oxherding" theme of the popular Zen parable can be traced back to old-Indian Buddhist traditions. A Hinayana scripture, the Ekottaragama Sutra, in Japanese Zdichi agongyb, describes eleven kinds of cattle herding and compares them with the various duties of a Buddhist monk.405 Paintings of wild geese and reed grass, popular in China since the end of the tenth century, acquired a similar religious facet in medieval Zen circles of both China and Japan. The wild geese shown in four of their basic behaviour posi- tions, i.e., in flight, hi, in cackling clamour, mel, sleeping, shuku, and feeding, shoku, were likened to the "Four Dignified Demeanours", shi'igi, of monastic discipline, i.e., correct walking, gyd, appropriate dwelling, 10t, correct sitting, za, and reclining, ga. Even though these aspects cannot be exactly matched, their relationship no doubt exceeds mere numerical identity. it is not clear if such wild geese pictures were created with allegorical intent from the very beginning, or if the Zen masters of the thirteenth and fourteenth cen- turies imbued them with that paradigmatic value. The second part of the Kundaikan sayuchdki, the manual of the shogunal collection of Chinese art compiled toward the end of the fifteenth century, deals with the question of how works of art are to be arranged in the official reception room, zashiki, of the Ashikaga residence. On a sketch in this work, four hanging scrolls can be seen on the tokonoma wall showing, from right to left, wild geese in reed grass flying, cackling, sleeping, and feeding.406 This arrangement of the wild geese, strikingly rendered in their four typical behavioural patterns, is certainly no coincidence, and the thus intended hint - at the time presumably within everybody's grasp - to exemplary monastic discipline no doubt reminded monks as well as lay brothers of their duties on their frequent visits to the Zen- supportive Ashikaga Shoguns. Clearly, wild geese paintings of this kind were created and hung with the intent to encourage and instruct, not only for decorative purposes. This explains why many rooms in Chinese and Japanese Zen monasteries were decorated with this iconographical theme. Evidence is found not only in literature, but also in medieval handscrolls or emaki, e.g., in the twelfth scroll of the fourteenth-century Genjb sanzd'e, the illustrated Biography of the famous Chinese Tang priest Xuanzang (600-664) at the Fujita Bijutsukan in Osaka.407 To this day, the theme of wild geese and reed grass can often be seen on sliding doors, fusuma, and screens, bybbu, in Japanese Zen monasteries. It is not known exactly why wild geese came to be chosen as symbol of monastic disci- pline. We do know, however, that the water fowl were admired in China for their precise instinct concerning time and place in their migration, for their extremely disciplined flight pattern, and for their lifelong faithfulness among pairs. Ethology considers the exemplary fidelity between partners one of the most remarkable characteristics of the anatidae.408 In China, they have been considered for centuries as symbol of matrimonial faithfulness, 172 Fig. 122 Seeing the Ox, the third stage of the Ten Oxherding Parable, with an inscription by Shaolin Miaosong (first half 13th century).

The wild goose is also said to be a reliable courier in Chinese literature and history. In Buddhist sources, the bird is sometimes used as motif of Zen Buddhist kban, but such passages do not shed any light on our ques- tion. Closer to a solution of the problem is an ancient Indian wild goose story that came to be included in the didactic, moralizing literature of Buddhism, adapted in the sense of Buddhist ethics.409 Various of its oldest parts have come down to us in Jitaka No. 502, 533, and 534, as well as in other old text compilations. Leaving out differences of liter- ary embellishing details, the contents of the story can be summarized as follows: In one of his earlier existences, Buddha Sakyamuni was king of the wild geese. One day, he led his flock from Mt. Citrakuta to a magnificent, famous pond near Benares. There, the goose king was caught in a trap, his one leg ensnared in a noose. Patiently, he waited for the flock to eat their fill before sounding his warning cry. The geese took to flight in a great flurry and escaped. Only Sakyamuni's faithful military commander Sumukha, an incarnation of the Buddha acolyte Ananda, stayed by the side of his master despite the latter's urgent pleas to leave. When the trapper came he was greatly surprised to see that only one of the two geese was caught. Sumukha told him about the virtue of devotion between friends and the loyalty toward his master, and the deeply impressed trapper freed the snared goose king. To thank the hunter for his magnanimous act, and to help him receive a reward, the two birds decided to meet the King of Benares, in whose ser- vices the trapper was employed. The king was greatly moved by the story and had the trapper richly rewarded. The king of the wild geese proclaimed his doctrine to the king of Benares and discussed the law of righteous behaviour with him. Then he returned with Sumukha to his subjects on Mt. Citrakuta. Illustrations of this so-called Hamsa Jataka are known from wall paintings of the fifth to sixth centuries in the Ajanta caves (cave No. II and XVII) and from reliefs at Borobudur in cen- tral Java dating to around 800.410 It may well be that this legend from one of the earlier existences of the Buddha gave rise to the wild geese allegory so popular in medieval Zen circles in China and Japan; after all, the story shows the prototype and model of all Buddhist monastic life, the historic founder of the religion, Sakyamuni, and one of his two first disciples, Ananda, in the guise of wild geese as the essence of dignified monastic behaviour in every situation of life, as symbol of Buddhist ethics. The Japanese Zen abbot Tesshu Tokusai occupied himself especially intensively with the subject of wild geese, no doubt as a reflection of his innermost conviction and his own ethical principles, since his life was marked by strict monastic propriety and discipline. He was deeply inspired by his intellectual and artistic tasks. His interest in painting was focused almost exclusively to secular subjects. Beside bamboo and orchids, he painted monkeys and water buffaloes.411 Tesshu Tokusai studied under Muso Soseki (1275-1351) in Kyoto and during the thirties of the fourteenth century in China. In 1362, he was appointed abbot of Manjuji, one of the most important Zen monasteries in Kybto. Four years later, he died at Ryuko'in, a small cloister of Tenryuji. His literary work, entitled Enbushu, contains a poem in honour of a dead wild goose. It is imbued with the Zen monk's great compassion for the helpless creature and in that sense reminiscent of Ikkyu's "requiem" for his sparrow Sonrin (Fig. 138).412 Tesshu's elegy is entitled Tdgan, "Mourning [the death] of a Wild Goose": Long ago / dug a pond and planted reeds for you, Always anxious that you might be bitten by a fox and die. How / regret that you spent your life evading hunter's arrows Only to leave me now, but not as a messenger carrying my letter. I could make friends with ground birds, but I have little time for them, I could talk with parrots, but I have no interest in their chatter. I pray that you will revive as a bird on the Pond of the West And await me there, preening the feathers of your green coat.413 In one of his best works, a pair of hanging scrolls at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the talented artist and literates united the four aspects of the wild geese in each 1 73</page><page sequence="167">picture respectively (Figs. 123-124).414 Each composition shows twenty-five wild geese, six in flight, and the others on shallow sand banks busily eating, peacefully sleeping, or raising their heads in shrieking cackle. Despite palpable caution in the execution, a cer- tain uniformity in some parts, and a striking tendency toward parallel repetition, the paint- ings are imbued with the restless bustle of pulsating life. At the same time, they render the atmosphere of autumnal desolation and chill, intimated especially by the withered, spiky reed grass rustling in the wind, painted by Tesshi with arresting, almost aggres- sive sprightliness. On the upper right and left edge, respectively, the two scrolls bear the square seal of the artist; one of the paintings also has a short, unfortunately incomplete dedication by the artist to a Chinese friend. Among the oldest known paintings showing wild geese in their four basic activities matching the correct behaviour of a Zen monk are two hanging scrolls dating to the early fourteenth century in Japanese collections.415 Originally, the two paintings probably belonged together as a pair, but they have slightly different dimensions due to new mountings. On the left scroll, three wild geese are sitting one close behind the other on a strip of land: the one in front is eating, the one in the middle is asleep, and the one in the back is craning her neck and clamoring; on the right scroll, at the Gumma Kenritsu Kindai Bijutsukan, two wild geese are flying above the reed grass in wind and rain. The poems inscribed at the edge of each painting are by the Chinese Zen master Yishan Yining (1247-1317) who was active in Japan from 1299 until his death, enjoying high repute in Japanese clerical, intellectual, and political circles. Numerous paintings with inscriptions by his hand are extant in Japan. In these two four-line poems - written in two vertical lines each -, the versed literatus evokes the mood of beginning winter and the longing for the clear autumn days of the rivers Xiao and Xiang. These two rivers flow into Lake Dongting in the northern part of Hunan Province in the south of China, a region cel- ebrated for its scenic beauty. Wild geese would migrate there during winter. It would seem obvious therefore that the pictorial representation of wild geese and reed grass has its origins in this area. The theme came to be treated as independent subject toward the end of the tenth century and its spread during the eleventh century was closely associ- ated with the names of the court painter Cui Bo, the painter-monk Huichong, and the imperial descendent Zhao Zonghan. During this early period, the subject of wild geese gave expression to a melancholic feeling. It elicits thoughts of the withering of plants and grasses in the cold of winter; of the change of seasons and the migration of many birds; of the unremitting rhythm of nature; of the impermanence of things and of parting; but also of renascent life, return, and reunion. Such ideas were bound to inspire Northern Song literati. The famous Su Dongpo (1036-1101) composed the following poem when he saw a painting of wild geese and reed grass by Huichong: Huichong's reeds-and-geese in mist and rain Lure me out to sit by the Xiao and Xiang Rivers and Dongting Lake, And make me want to hire a skiff to go home. Such is what a painting must do, as the ancients rightly said.416 Beside the encouraging, didactic "Oxherding" parable and the wild geese allegory, Zen art also created simile-like representations with warning, prophylactic intent showing the erroneous paths leading far away from the Zen goal and tempting the adept in search of his true, own Self. The most popular simile for the hopeless entanglement of unenlight- ened nature in the world of secular phenomena is the monkey trying to grasp the moon - usually not shown in the painting - reflected in the water and thus failing to see the real moon. Among the numerous monkey paintings connected - some of them already in early Japanese sources - with the name of the famous Chinese Chan painter-monk Muqi, there is a hanging scroll with a poetic inscription by Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1 269). The paint- ing, listed in the Butsunichi'an k'5motsu mokuroku and thus already at Engakuji about a century after its purported date, shows a "Monkey Practising zazen".417 The practice of sitting in meditation was of great significance in most Zen monasteries and had a high moral value for almost all serious adepts.

Japan, wrote in one of his early works, the Fukan zazengi, "General Instructions for the Promotion of zazen": If you want to attain enlightenment, hasten to practice zazen. For zazen, a quiet room is suitable, food and beverage be moderate. Cast all ties away, curb the ten thousand things, do not think of good and evil, do not judge right and wrong, keep in check the course of consciousness, cause to cease the activities of desire, imagination, and judg- ment.418 But what does it mean when a Chan monk familiar with the custom of meditation, such as Muqi, shows a monkey steeped in meditative oblivion? Is it parody; is it a veiled sar- castic reprimand of the clergy of that time; or is it a tribute to the monkey as the "Great Saint Resembling Heaven", qitian dasheng, to whom even temples are consecrated in South China? Most likely, it is satiric criticism of a religious exercise debased all too often by thoughtlessness, even selfishness, and which even a monkey in the mood for all sorts of pranks can imitate. Already the Tang master Nanyue Huairang (677-744) mentioned repeatedly the danger of spiritual rigidity during zazen. Once, he embarrassed his extremely talented, incessantly meditating disciple Mazu Daoyi (709-788) with a simile mocking reason when he asked why Mazu was practicing zazen. The disciple answered: "I want to become a Buddha." Whereupon Huairang picked up a tile and began to pol- ish it on a stone. Confused, his pupil asked him what the meaning of this strange activ- ity was. The master explained that he wanted to make a mirror out of the tile. "How can a tile be turned into a mirror by polishing?" Mazu said incredulously, and the master retorted: "How can anybody be turned into a Buddha by zazen?" By literally holding up the mirror - already at that time a metaphor for a pure, enlightened spirit in Zen circles - to his disciple, the master makes unmistakably clear that the notion of having to become a Buddha is an impediment on the way toward the fundamental experience of Zen, to wit the insight that each and every creature has always partaken of or been the Buddha Nature. Another amiably encoded, ironizing criticism such as Muqi may well have intended with his meditating monkey was implied by the last great representative of Edo period Zen, Gibon Sengai (1750-1837), when he had a frog - quickly rendered with a few pale grey strokes - exclaim in the painting's inscription: "If a man becomes a Buddha by practis- ing zazen ."419 The next line remained unwritten, but the continuation of the thought seems inescapable: ... a frog, practising incessant zazen due to his natural posture, would then have become a Buddha long ago. A facetious painting by the "Old Man" Sesson Shukei (ca.1504-ca.1589) in the Yanagi Collection, Kyoto, is also permeated with a profound humour so typical of many Zen paintings (No. 51). A young monkey on a descending slope is stealthily trying to catch a crab by grabbing it by its legs, while three older monkeys in the background watch the curious encounter with visible amusement. It is not clear exactly what this grotesque crab hunt is alluding to. Of course, the catching of crabs brings to mind "Reverend Kensu", the prawn fisher, who is said to have experienced enlightenment while catching a prawn. Did the inventive painter-monk Sesson intend to imitate this situation with his monkey and exaggerate it thus ad absurdum? We do not know. However, it is a fact that he sel- dom bowed to convention in his paintings, turning the most elementary contexts of life on their head and contorting the natural state of things in this world, subjecting them to his artistic purposes, "bending" them in his sense. Thus, he juxtaposes monkeys living in trees and bamboo groves with the crab used to water and the river shores, or he paints the bamboo - usually characterized by its straight, upright growth - unnaturally crooked and bent, almost reminiscent of the long arms of the monkeys. It is tempting indeed to think of a visualized kdan when viewing this enigmatic painting. The Zen monk and painter Josetsu, active at the beginning of the fifteenth century at Shbkokuji, also used metaphorical distance to render the senselessness of frantic attempts to apprehend the nature of Zen with unfit means, methods, or contraptions. On his celebrated painting in ink and light colours on paper at Taizb'in of Mybshinji, Kybto, an old man tries to catch a slippery catfish with a narrow-mouthed gourd - an attempt conspicuous for its very hopelessness (Fig. 125).420 Most likely, the Ashikaga Shogun 175</page><page sequence="169">-f - i-i ~U .d;k -7k" -1 V 71F- 4I~~~~- IM :fi1- _NA4i Ss||| .,.4 Yoshimochi (1386-1428), himself a Zen enthusiast of some artistic talent, commissioned this work, known in scholarly literature as Hyonen zu, at the occasion of a gathering of the literary clergy of Ky-to around 1413. No fewer than 31 Zen "literati monks", bunjins6, among them such eminent gozan representatives as Daigaku ShusO (1345-1423), Gyoku'en Bonpb (1348-after 1420), Genchf Shugaku (1359-1428), and Daigu Shochi (died 1439), composed short poems that were subsequently mounted with Josetsu's painting as one hanging scroll. Such combinations of painting, poetry, and writing became an art form popular especially in Zen circles during the first half of the fifteenth century. At the latest since the time of the creative Chan master Zhaozhou Congshen (778-897), known for his paradoxical statements, the bottleneck gourd - in China an old attribute of Daoist magicians - came to be considered as a special object in Zen circles, too.

(1973), Nos. 38-39, pp. 80f. In the spiritual climate of Zen, enlightenment could be attained by means of plain, every- day activities. A pair of scrolls showing a monk "Sewing his Ragged Robe under the Morning Sun", zhaoyang chuan pona, and another monk "Finishing the Rest of his Suitra Reading in the Moonlight", duiyue Iiao caning, give this fundamental attitude artistic expression.421 In Japanese art-historical writings these subjects are usually referred to as chdyd hotetsu and taigetsu rybkyb. According to the Zen monk Zuikei Shuho (1391 -1473) of Shbkokuji in Kybto, the impulse for this purely Zen theme originated with a Song poet by the name of Wang Fengchen and his above-cited two-line verse. The recording of short painting inscriptions in the collected works of renowned Chan masters, such as Beijian Jujian (1164-1246), Shitian Faxun (1171 -1245), Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269), Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263), Xiyan Liaohui (1198-1262), Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?), and others, bespeaks the popularity of these two themes - they always occur together - during the late Song Dynasty.422 The oldest extant version, and at the same time the best, emanating charm and subtle humour, is a pair of hang- ing scrolls of the otherwise unknown painter Wu Zhuzi dating to 1295 at the Tokugawa Bijutsukan, Nagoya.423 The right-hand scroll shows a bald monk on a rocky promontory trying to pass a thread, fixed in his mouth and drawn around his toe, through the eye of *. . ... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 1.4* .. . . . . : : . . * . . - . ~ ~ ~ ~ &amp;. 4 - ;., *.s *-.z - .;&amp; -J"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ , .. ,..- , * ,., Ec X 177</page><page sequence="171">a needle. On the left-hand painting, another old monk is seated cross-legged on a rock and holds a book scroll closely in front of his eyes in order to read the sutra text in the moonlight that is not indicated in the painting. The two figures of the diptych's interre- lated compositions, rendered in vigorous grey brushstrokes with a few black accents, are turned toward each other. In accordance with traditional conventions, the inscriptions by the hand of the artist near the upper edge of each painting correspond in their direction with the sight line of the two represented figures. The subject of chbyb-taigetsu, of great popularity in Japan, too, since the early fourteenth century, reminds the Zen adept of two important aspects of monastic life (Fig. 126): on the one hand of the equality of intellec- tual and manual activity, of spiritual-religious discipline and physical labour relaxing the intellect; on the other hand of the obligation, lasting from the first rays of the sun to the moonlight, to remain awake and alert in all activities for the sudden, immediate insight into the Self, for the awakening of one's own Buddha Nature. 13. Plum Blossoms, Bamboo, and Orchids The iconographical significance of some animals and plants, such as monkeys, water buffaloes, wild geese, or plum blossoms, in Zen art has already been mentioned; a few supplementary remarks may thus suffice to suggest the hidden, complex meanings of some seemingly innocuous, every-day subjects. For the painting of plum blossoms, the artists could refer to elaborate theoretical treatises and to illustrated books with practi- cal advice dating to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.424 The earliest pioneer of monochrome "ink plum blossoms", momei (Jap. bokubai), is considered to be the Chan painter-monk Huaguang Zhongren (died 1123) from Guiji near Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province. His style is said to have been continued and further enriched with variations by the Song literatus Yang Buzhi (1098-1169) whose own contributions were sometimes rejected as deviations by later art critics. One of the earliest Japanese examples follow- ing this Chinese tradition is the hanging scroll at the Masaki Bijutsukan in Tadaoka (No. 45), dating to the eighties of the fourteenth century and bearing a short poem by the gozan literatus Zekkai Chushin (1336-1405): When visiting Zhongyongzi on Mt. Gu The plum blossoms are reflected in the water by his hermitage. Although the courier did not deliver a letter from southern lands One can see the silhouette of the branches against the moon at dusk. Sho ken.425 Indeed, the snow-white plum blossoms shine on the even, pale-gray, watery ink ground, tanmo (Jap. tanboku), like glimmering stars in the evening sky. Because the wind blows the petals dancing through the air, literary allusions often introduce the plum blossom with the metaphor of the "courier". The Song poet Lin Bu (967-1028), who is said to have surrounded himself with plum blossoms and cranes in his hermitage, lived on Gushandao, the "Lone Mountain Island", in West Lake near Hangzhou in today's Zhejiang Province. He shared his deep love of nature with his neighbour, the monk Zhiyuan Wuwai, known as Zhongyongzi. The Emperor Renzong (reigned 1022-1063) honoured the reclu- sive, modest poet posthumously with the title Hejing Xiansheng, "Master of Harmonious Tranquillity". Ever since the time of Lin Bu, the cold of winter and plum blossoms bloom- ing in the snow are considered the symbol of moral integrity and self-chosen reclusion removed from the bustle of this world, an ideal to which the Zen masters felt a deep affin- ity in their search for the pure void and enlightenment.426 The colophon by Zekkai Chu-shin can be found in the compilation of his poems and prosa, Shokenko, "Shoken's Draft Manuscript", and from the same source we know that originally, the scroll at the Masaki Bijutsukan must have formed a diptych with another painting. Moreover, the Zen abbot writes the following about the artist: The real name of the painter is not clear. I only know that his nickname is "KyushO Kybkaku" [i.e., the "Mad Guest from KyushO'7. I once met him on the road, carrying his own bedding. Whenever he saw beautiful scenery, he would lie down upon his mat at once and start whistling and singing, and whatever he said would be very strange. I think that he is a person who is good at painting, but who deliberately takes refuge in mad- 1 78 424 Concerning the depiction and significance of the plum blossom in Chinese art, see Maggie Bickford: Bones of Jade, Soul of /ce.

However, his brushwork is too thin and stiff and does not satisfy people. Have therefore added these poems to allay these shortcomings. 427 The "Mad Guest" from the southwest of Japan may have been no one else but Josetsu who hailed from Kyu-shu- and came to Kyo-to, where he worked at least temporarily for Shbkokuji. Around 1400, he must have had contact with Zekkai Chu-shin since it was the distinguished abbot who gave him his name Josetsu. At any rate, the artist was most familiar with the Song and Yuan tradition of plum painting, and his well-balanced com- position was in no great need of the three line inscription. The plum branch, painted with- out contours in the so-called "boneless" manner, mogu (Jap. mokkotsu), and running in an elegant curve across nearly the entire height of the painting, follows a compositional model compared by painting treatises with the stellar constellation of the "Big Dipper", hbnidou ingy (_ Inn ho~ki tosei).

The counterpart of this unmistakably virtuoso, professional plum blossom painting is an unassuming, truly amateurish scroll of the same subject by the eccentric Zen master Ikkyut Sbjun (1394-1481), who considered himself also as a "mad" literatus and used the name "Crazy Cloud", Kybun. In his narrow hanging scroll at the MOA Museum of Art, Atami (No. 46), the inscription is an integral part of the painting. The vertical, written line along the left edge of the scroll, essential for the composition and used by Ikkyui to unfold his patriarchal pedigree, corresponds with the almost bare, vertically rising branch pushed to the very edge on the right side of the painting. The upward movement of the branch creates an exciting tension with the downward reading direction of the written line on the left. With this conscious, formal juxtaposition Ikkyui may well have intended an allu- sion to his own situation since he considered himself the only true heir and guardian of the Zen of his spiritual forebears: solitary, almost without blossoms, and with little life left in him, but indestructible and upright like a plum branch surviving even the most bitter winter cold. Preceding his own seal and signature Ikkyui listed his Zen ancestors as fol- lows: [Descendant] in the seventh generation of Xutang [Zhiyu, 1185-1269]; In the sixth generation of Nanpo [Jdmin, 1235-1308]; Fifth leave [at the branch] of Daito [Kokushi, 1282-1337] as "Guest at the Gate" of Ryuho/zan, i.e., Daitokuji]; Offspring of the Reverend Ryozen [Tettd Giko, 1295-1369]; Grandson of Gengai [SdchO, 1305-1390]; Single son of Kaso [Sodon, 1352-1428]. [Soijun of the Eastern Sea, Ikky0, the "old cassock" rono, [made] this poem and paint- ing with one brush. It would seem that Ikkyui had a predilection for the theme of the flowering plum with its complex, profound meanings and allusions, since he used it repeatedly in his unassum- ing paintings as well as in his poetry. Numerous poems in his Kyounsh0, "Crazy Cloud Anthology", attest to this preference.428 The pictorial and literary motif of the flowering plum derived its special place from the actual appearance and situation in nature. Since early times the plum, women and their beauty, transience of values and the passage of time were drawn together in a single theme. Ikkyut's verse on the Atami painting which is identical with his inscriptions on three other plum blossom pictures was inspired by tra- ditional Chinese images and associations: The clear moon adorns the Princess of Shouyang. Why does such a flowering face harbor the emptiness of icy smile? If tonight's spring fragrance transmits my message, Sad dreams of many years will disappear like a single zephyr. Ikkyut identified the flowering plum with the elegant daughter of Emperor Wu of Song (reigned 420-422), the Princess of Shouyang. She is said to have fallen asleep in the palace garden "when a plum blossom dropped on her forehead, forming a five-petal flo- ral pattern. She was unable to shake it off. [Her mother] the empress made her keep it, wanting to see how long it would last. After three days it finally fell off when washed. The palace ladies admired it and ended up imitating it. This is [the origin of] the present-day plum-blossom make-up pattern."429 Two other themes were frequently borrowed by Zen artists from the painting tradition of the highly erudite scholar-amateur painters: bamboo and orchids. Because of their attractive appearance, their elegance, and the characteristics associated with them gen- erally in East Asia, both plants are an inexhaustible source of inspiration and an ideal medium of expression for Zen Buddhist ideas. Moreover, the close technical-artistic rela- tionship between painting and the art of writing offered the monastic literati painters, for these subjects especially, opportunity for the immediate visual recording of spiritual insights or personal experiences. In such scrolls, polished virtuosity was consciously shunned, and an artless and unassuming, playful carelessness took precedence.

Shunjo (1358-1422), appointed to the position of 23rd abbot of Shokokuji in 1414, wrote about the enticing visual effect of bamboo shadows: Uneven bamboo shadows on still, dark moss, Lie half across the front porch, half across the rear, Some nearly gone, carried off by the setting sun, While others approach with the rising moon.430 Beyond its visual and formal attraction, bamboo is especially treasured in East Asia since it has symbolized for centuries fundamental ethical values: its straight upward growth has been compared with the upright character of an exemplary person; its hard, even, and flexible stem symbolizes inner honesty and the steadfastness and firmness of a noble being, despite apparent leniency; its fresh, green leaves throughout the year are the image of constancy, resilience, and unflinching loyalty of a morally irreproachable char- acter. Moreover, its inner hollowness, in seeming contradiction with its strength, corre- sponds with the Zen ideal of the "Inner Void", kO. All these virtues are inherent in bamboo in plain, unpretentious fashion. It is therefore not surprising that the characteristics sym- bolized by it, such as uprightness, strength, plainness, or purity, were deeply admired in Zen circles. The universal appeal of bamboo in East Asia also explains why Zen abbots in China as well as in Japan had many rooms in their monasteries decorated with bamboo paintings, a custom that goes back at least to the tenth century. In the "Three Wintry Friends", sui- han sanyou or setsuri sanyO, bamboo - together with pine and plum tree - represents the elementary, primordial life force of nature, tenaciously surviving even in the cold of winter. In a magnificent hanging scroll belonging to the Bunkacho, Tokyo, an anonymous master created a striking image of the "Three Friends" in deep snow sometime between 1413 and 1420, and five renowned Zen monks composed poems for the scroll (No. 48) 431 As one of the "Four Gentlemen", sijunzi (Jap. shikunshl), bamboo, together with plum blossom, orchid, and chrysanthemum, represents the four seasons; and as one of the "Three Pure Ones", sanqing (Jap. sansel), bamboo, old trees, and rocks or, according to another tradition, bamboo, plum blossoms, and rocks, were associated with high ethical and aesthetic tenets ever since the time of the statesman, poet, painter, and calligrapher Su Shi (Dongpo, 1036-1101). This explains why Su and his friends exacted again and again in their writings meditative immersion into the nature of bamboo to the point of mystical identification with the plant's essence. Of course, such ideas fell on especially fertile soil among Zen adepts, and the numerous extant poems and painting colophons of Zen Buddhist monks on the subject of bamboo show deep sympathy and ardent affec- tion. The Chan master Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339) begins a poem on an ink painting showing "Windblown Bamboo among Rocks" at the Nezu Institute of Fine Arts, Tokyo (Fig. 129), with the line: "The purity of rocks, how could it resemble the purity of bamboo!" The word qing, "pure", which is also the first character of the author's four- character name, occurs no fewer than five times in the four lines of the poem.432 This emphasizes symptomatically the high esteem in which the ethical ideals symbolized by bamboo were held in the consciousness of Zen adepts. Nor did the pictorial rendering of the orchid (epidendron) with its supple, thin, long leaves and its fragrant blossoms remain the monopoly of literati painting; on the contrary, it is certainly no coincidence that some of the most famous and capable orchid painters were Zen Buddhist monks, such as Xuechuang Puming (died 1349), active at Yunyansi and Chengtiansi in Suzhou in China (Fig. 131),433 and in Japan the two followers of his style, the abbots Tesshi Tokusai (died 1366) (Fig. 130) and Gyoku'en BonpO (1348-after 1420).434 Bonpo painted the bold, contrapuntal composition at the Kyoto National Museum with "Orchids, Bamboo, and Thorns" (No. 44). The skilfully integrated inscrip- tion by his own hand is dedicated to an unidentified "silitra prefect", zosu, whose name cannot be clearly read, but may have been Sodei or Soko. Even though conservative contemporaneous art critics judged Puming's paintings as barely good enough for dis- play in monks' quarters, but not enough for the decoration and enjoyment in literati stu- dios, the popularity of his work must have been considerable: according to other sources, every household in Suzhou had an orchid painting by his hand. Obviously he enjoyed great public prestige and success as an artist, for high officials and influential 181</page><page sequence="175">personages are said to have requested and collected his works; famous connoisseurs of his own time composed commendable poems and provided appreciative colophons for his pictures which he used to sign Xuechuang, "Snow Window". Some of Puming's ideas on his method of orchid painting are recorded by one of his followers named Kong Qi: [. 1 One should grasp the brush firmly with his index finger, support it with his middle and fourth fingers, and use his little finger to guide the movement of the brush by touching the surface of the paper and supporting the brush from underneath. The initial stroke should be heavy, the middle one light, the last one heavy, and the closing one somewhat light. This will show the leaves in their back, side, oblique and frontal views just as in nature. There are three-turn strokes and four-turn ones. Leaves are shown in the man- ner of big fishing poles and small fishing poles. [..] The brush should break the ink in order to show the middle part of the leaves in thin ink and the two edges in darker shades. [...]435 Moreover, in his orchid paintings, the Chan abbot's intention seems to have been the expression of Buddhist ideas: among his leaves, mostly arranged in pairs, he saw the long ones as emblems of the spiritual traditions of Mahayana, "Leaves of the Great Vehicle", and the short ones as "Leaves of the Small Vehicle", i.e., of H-nayana. In Chinese poetry, the inconspicuously blooming orchid has been a symbol of untouch- able purity and selfless modesty since oldest times. With great empathy, numerous poets sang of its gracefulness and lofty reticence, and thus the orchid came to stand as a metaphor for unobtrusive feminine elegance, harmonious fragrance, and self-sufficient joy. Li Bai (Taibo, 701-762) dedicated the following verse in its honour: The orchid blooms alone in a comer of the garden, Quite overgrown by masses of weeds. Even if the spring sun shines its light on it, The autumn moon will frighten it soon. For when dew drizzles down early in the morning, Its emerald charm fades but all too easily. But - if the fresh winds did never blow, Would its fragrance ever waft to anybody?436 The locus classicus for the orchid, however, is the famous opening poem of the "Elegies of Chu", Chuci, the elegy "On Encountering Sorrow", Lisao, perhaps the only authentic work of Qu Yuan (343?-277 B.C.). The poem is considered to be an encoded self-por- trait of the poet who, as minister at the court of King Huai of Chu (reigned 328-299 B.C.), repeatedly suffered misunderstandings, slanders, and intrigues. Finally, he was dis- missed from his office and, after years of aimless roaming in exile, he put an end to his desperate life by drowning himself in the floods of the Miluo river. Again and again, Qu Yuan returns to the image of the orchid: The day was getting dark and drawing to its close. Knotting orchids, I waited in indecision. The muddy, impure world, so undiscriminating, Seeks always to hide beauty, out of jealousy 437 His undisputed, persistent striving for purity and integrity in the face of flagrant injustice was bound to "isolate Qu Yuan from his social environment" like the lone orchid in seclu- sion.438 The figure of the misunderstood and banished statesman elicited the most diverse ideas all of which dealt with the loneliness of the individual among the mass of the ordinary people, thoughtlessly leading their lives in exasperating security. In Qu Yuan, one can re-discover the descendant of all the many statesmen of the 'Book of Songs' who protested in vain against the injustices of their rulers. But he also personifies the fate of those banished whose 'being dispatched' to the boundaries of the cultured world was part of a sacrifice by which the culture was supposed to be safeguarded. Moreover, with his persistence in purity, he was an incarnation of those self-exiled 'escapees' who avoided the government seat in the center unless it was not rigorously clean."439 It was 182 * Ar 4*:|EsSS1'v S ~~~~~~4Th k |~ ~ l: Wi~~~~~gE &lt; .a E-- Ft5S -R-~~ 4 * j III I.

Some commenta- tors of this innovative masterpiece of early Chi- nese poetry think that the frequently mentioned flowers and plants stand for historical figures in the immediate circle of the author.

Thus the orchid became - especially when it appeared as graphical ink play on empty ground, i.e., not growing from the soil (robbed by the foreign rulers) - the symbol of clandestine political and intellectual resistance among artists and thinkers.440 Many poems and painting colophons show how intensively the complex ramifications of the orchid's symbolism in traditional China were present in the consciousness of the lit- erary Zen masters in Japan. On a painting with orchids, bamboo, and rocks by his already deceased friend Tesshu Tokusai (died 1366), Gido Shushin (1325-1388) wrote a melan- cholic poem in which the following lines occur (Fig. 130): His orchid flowers capture the likeness of Ch'0 P'ing [i.e., Qu Yuan]. At daybreak rain dampens lakes and mountains under its clouds, In spring mist conceals the colors of bamboo at Ch'u rivers.44 On another hanging scroll depicting an orchid, this one in the Burke Collection, New York, the painter himself wrote a short verse. He, too, alludes to the long-past kingdom of southern Chu, the home country of Qu Yuan, the exemplary, unjustly exiled official and poet who was to make the orchid immortal with his elegiac "On Encountering Sorrow". In his colophon Tesshut Tokusai wrote: The river of the Chu country is one hundred thousand miles behind me, But my thoughts are with it. Let me ask the fragrant orchids - Are you still the flavor of flavors?442 Literati as well as the Zen clergy had a predilection for depictions of the orchid in differ- ent seasons and atmospheres, in the sunshine or under the moonlight, in wind, clear weather, rain or snow. Thus, the Chan abbot Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?) composed poems that can be found in his "Recorded Sayings" for three such sets of four paintings each,443 and the Chan master Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263), known from numerous colophons on paintings, added a four-line verse to an orchid painting traditionally attrib- uted to Yujian.444 Ever since the thirteenth century in China, and since the fourteenth in Japan, the combination of the orchid with bamboo, thorn bushes, and rocks has firmly belonged to the standard repertoire of literary oriented ink painters. 14. Vegetables and Fruits The representation of vegetables and fruits - rather prosaic subjects when compared with the elegant plum, bamboo, and orchid - may well have been exclusive to the monas- terial atmosphere of Zen. Especially the radish, rafuku or daikon, and the turnip, kabura, - both important parts of the vegetarian Buddhist monastic diet - were often depicted. Dbgen (1200-1253), always intent on the strict adherence to monastic rules, points out that the daily chores in the monastic kitchen are just as important as daily meditation or pious recitation of sutras, and that eminent Chan masters had held the office of "kitchen chef", tenzo, already centuries ago. In his instruction manual for the monastery cook en- titled Tenzo kydkun and written in 1237, he maintains that the vegetables selected for the meals are close in taste to the daigo (Sanskrit: sarpirmanda), a fine, nourishing milk extract also used as medicament and thought to be a simile for the Buddha Nature, the true doctrine, or nirvana: If one selects a simple vegetable and serves it to the monks, the meal will be quite equi- valent to food with daigo taste, provided [the cook] prepares it with due devotion to the Buddha Law. Just as all rivers flow into the great sea of the Buddha Law, there are essen- tially neither daigo nor vegetable taste, but only the one of the great sea. [.1.. If one nour- ishes the sprout of the Righteous View, dbge, and tends the Holy Grain of Buddha, the taste of daigo and the one of vegetables are all the more identical and in no way differ- ent. [.1. This should be taken to heart. Concentrate your thoughts on the fact that ye- 183</page><page sequence="177">getables nourish the seed from which springs the Buddha, and that it makes the sprout of the Righteous View grow. Therefore do not malign vegetables, but hold them in high esteem. Whoever wants to progress [toward the truth] among people and in heaven must be capable of bringing people closer to enlightenment by means of simple vegetables.445 Considering such requests, it is not surprising that vegetables and fruits, such as radishes and turnips, eggplants and cabbages, persimmons, kaki, and horse chestnuts were elevated to dignified subjects of Zen art. Painter-monks such as Muqi, Jonan Etetsu (1444-1507), or Sesson Shuckei (ca.1504-ca.1589) made such subjects an important part of their iconographical repertory.446 Even the most humble products of nature con- tain, as Dogen explains, the essence of the Buddha doctrine; they provide an authentic and - in the ink paintings - a visual-metaphorical "foretaste" of the ultimate truth of Zen. They are thus not, as one might suppose at first sight, unpretentious still lives, but specif- ically Zen Buddhist "ciphers of transcendence" imbued with objectivity and straightfor- wardness. Bizarre, leafy grapevines with succulent grapes also belong to the subject range of Zen painting. Yuc'e Gukei may well have been the first Japanese painter to use the subject during the second half of the fourteenth century (No. 43).447 Most likely, he was inspired by Chinese "ink plays", moxi, Japanese bokugi, such as the thirteenth-century painter Riguan Ziwen (also Zhongyan) used to specialize in. A fervent Song loyalist, Riguan reacted to the foreign rule of the Mongols by wandering around the country for years before he became a monk and retired to Ma'naosi on West Lake near Hangzhou.448 The gifted poet, calligrapher, and painter revered the eccentric Chan artist Guanxiu (832-912), whose verses he sometimes cited in his own works.449 He loved wine, and pursued his artistic inclinations often while inebriated. He is said to have found his new painting subject when he saw the bizarre shadow of a grapevine on a moonlit night. His fluid cursive script goes hand in hand with the unorthodox style of his paintings, remind- ing a critic of "torn monks' robes".450 The grapevine painting that can be attributed most reliably to Riguan was painted in 1291. The horizontal composition as well as the free handling of the ink are very similar to the scroll by Yu'e Gukei, who may well have seen one of Riguan's paintings that are said to have been brought to Japan by the Zen mas- ter Yishan Yining (1 247-1317) in 1299. Such paintings were most likely to have appealed to the free spirit and the unbiased artistic eye of the unconventional Gukei. With great accuracy, he captured the vigorous growth and the tangled character of the grapevine spreading in all directions, signing his vibrant "ink play" on the left edge of the painting. The cursive brushwork of the inscription as well as the unusual inclination and composi- tion of certain characters in it are well adapted to the vehement handling of the ink in the painting. At the same time, the inscription acts as compositional counterweight, creating a latent tension with corresponding and contrasting formal elements. The otherwise unknown author of the colophon, Baisetsu Sei'in, has at times been identified with the Zen master Sesson Yubai (1290-1346), one of the dominant pillars of gozan literature. While the inscription is signed Baisetsu'd, "Old Baisetsu", however, the round seal clearly reads Se'in.451 The stylistic counterpoint to Gukei's grapevine in the Kozo Yabumoto Collection, Amagasaki, are the enchanting two scrolls by the painter-monk Gu'an, probably active toward the end of the fourteenth century, in the Burke Collection, New York (Fig. 133), and at Honpbji, Kybto (Fig. 132).452 They show nothing of the expressive power and unbridled vehemence of Gukei, but they are characterized by high formal discipline of the pictorial presentation, by sensibility in the handling of the most delicate nuances of the ink, and a careful, almost realistically objective representation of the subject. In masterly fashion, Gu'an uses the "boneless manner", mokkotsuho, renouncing outlines and using dark-light contrasts to achieve volume and surface characterization of the light and dark ripe grapes as well as of the overlapping, brittle leaves. A solitary cicada further con- tributes to the autumnal ambiance of the painting. With great empathy and precision, the painter has captured the mainspring of insect and plant, the ripening and withering of nature. Most likely, the two paintings were originally a diptych. At least the placement of the identical seals on both scrolls, Gu'an and Bokurin Gu'an, on the lower right and left side, respectively, the composition, and the dimensions would indicate that much.453 According to the Honcho gashi, published in 1678 by Kano EinO (1 634-1 700) and one of 184 445 After the German translation by Oscar Benl: "Die Lehre des Kuchenmeisters.

Nardiello). the oldest Japanese art-historical works, Gu'an Shichi was a painter-monk who emulated the style of Muqi and was renowned for his paintings of monkeys. However, his two extant grapevine paintings in their light, almost transparent delicacy are rather reminis- cent of a work in the Tokyo National Museum, entitled Putao chuijia (Jap. Bud5 suika), "Grapevine Dangling from Trellis", attributed traditionally to the Yuan master Ren Renfa (1255-1328) on the basis of the calligraphic brushwork of the short inscription.454 Exactly why the exotic grapevine inspired such unconventional painter-monks as Riguan, Gukei, Gu'an, the Ikkyi disciple Bokusai (1412?-1492),455 and Sesson Shikei (ca. 1504-ca. 1589)456 is not clear. Perhaps the fact that it was imported from the west, like Buddhism, contributed to its appeal, beside its formal attraction, such as the light and shadow play created by its winding vine, its lush leaves, and its glistening grapes. Zheng Yuanyou (1292-1364), a younger contemporary of Riguan, commented in a poem on a painting by the latter: "Why did the master choose only this subject for his paintings? It was only because the Han envoy brought it back from afar."457 Zen monks always asso- 185</page><page sequence="179">ciated foreign imports with the origin of their own school, with the coming of the Indian founder patriarch Bodhidharma from the west. In the case of the grapevine, its vigorous growth and the ripening of its succulent grapes may have suggested the spreading and fruition of Zen in Japan. 15. Birds Simple animal paintings, seemingly irrelevant from a religious point of view, often show essential concepts of Buddhist ethics allegorically, while manifesting at the same time Zen's spiritualized view of nature. The Chan painter-monk Luochuang - active in the sec- ond half of the thirteenth century at Liutongsi on "West Lake" near Hangzhou, i.e., the monastery headed at the time, or shortly before, by Muqi458 - gives a straightforward interpretation of his painting of a white rooster under bamboo in the Tokyo National Museum (Fig. 134). The rooster, tenth animal in the Chinese zodiac, has traditionally been considered one of the main representatives of the male principle yang in China. The white rooster was revered as a holy animal with the power to ban evil influences; the colour of his plumage was an unmistakable hint to his purity and the sincerity of his disposition. In his ink painting, Luochuang left the white rooster in reserve on the evenly grey wash of the background. It is night. The rooster's proudly raised head, shown in profile looking toward left, is characterized by a firmly resolved, stern expression. Following tradition, the painter wrote his four-line poem against the sight-line direction of the rooster, i.e., from left to right. Evidently, he did not consider the inscription as equal partner of the painting, but rather in its inconspicuous, compositional subordination as explanatory means in the service of the represented subject: His thoughts are intent on the beginning of the fifth night watch. He keeps his five virtues mysteriously hidden deep inside. Looking up, he awaits the time of light. The East is already softly tinted. Luochuang. The first, third, and fourth lines characterize the nocturnal ambiance. In anticipation of the dawn, the rooster concentrates on his daily duties as the responsible head of a flock of chickens, mindful of his five virtues, as the second line indicates. An old commentary, the Hanshi waizhuan by Han Ying (ca.135 B.C.), expounding moral precepts of the clas- sic "Book of Songs", Shijing, says that the rooster is characterized especially by the fol- lowing five virtues: his crown-like comb symbolizes his literary learning, wen; the spurs on his legs indicate his fighting spirit, wu; his intrepidity and braveness in the face of the enemy show his courage, yong; his call-notes when he finds food show his selfless benevolence, ren; and his precise, reliable instinct for time and punctuality points to his trustworthiness, xin. These five virtues, which the rooster has been embodying for edu- cated Chinese ever since the Han Dynasty and with which Luochuang was no doubt familiar, may generally refer to a venerable person, but in the present case - depicted by a Chan monk - they are probably meant to apply to an exemplary abbot. Daily life in a Zen monastery begins with the fifth night watch, i.e., at four o'clock in the morning, and the abbot's thoughts are concentrated on this moment; already before daybreak, he is concerned about the well-being of the monks entrusted to him, and always mindful of the five virtues. In our opinion, Luochuang's painting of a white rooster, maybe his only extant work, serves to bring to mind fundamental principles of Zen Buddhist ethics by means of an established emblem. Moreover, the white rooster reminds the thoughtful viewer of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni who experienced his Great Enlightenment - the "time of light" - when he saw the morning star on the eastern sky at the beginning of the fifth night watch, an experience toward which all Zen Buddhists strive. "Two Sparrows in Bamboo", unfortunately in very had condition, by the Zen painter-monk Yu'e Gukel - known to have lived in Kamakura between 1361 and 1375 - a disciple of Tesshh Tokusai, is imbued with metaphorical allusions to central figures in the succes- sion of Sbkyamuni.459 The enchanting small work, signed in the lower right corner, belongs to Daijiji in Kumamoto Prefecture (Fig. 135).

Out surges the dragon of Maudgalyyana. In the grove is the sacred child. Who is to open a Bodhisattva's palace? Ten'an. 460 Kagyapa (called Mahakasyapa after his enlightenment) and Maudgalyayana are among the Ten Great Disciples of the historical Buddha. Buddhist tradition endows Maudgalyayana with spiritual power and supernatural might; Kayapa is known for his silent understand- ing of the core of Buddha's teaching: when Sakyamuni answered a fundamental ques- tion of faith simply by showing a humble flower without any comment, Katyapa was the only one to show his grasp of the master's meaning by smiling. No doubt, sparrows were a favourite subject of Zen Buddhist painter-monks and literati, since they embodied, in their unfettered freedom and joy of living, the Zen adept's ideal of detachment from this- worldly strictures. On a lost fan painting showing "Sparrows and Bamboo", the gozan monk Kisei Reigen (1404-1489) commented on the subject in a poem: A branch of bamboo stretched over the wall Rises and falls unpredictably in the wind, While sparrows, trying to perch for the evening, with unsettled hearts Flutter up to it and then away again...461 There are no inscriptions specifically expounding the meaning of sparrow paintings such as Ka'o's "Sparrow on a Rock by Bamboo" (No. 47, Fig. 19) and its pendant in the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, showing three sparrows and a flowering plum branch and dating to the first half of the fourteenth century (Fig. 137). Nevertheless, they probably have to be interpreted under the aspect indicated above, including the religious inten- tions of the artist. It is no accident that such unpretentious paintings were especially appreciated by followers of the tea ceremony in Japan, a ritual that has its origin ulti- mately in Zen monasteries. The Suzume no hosshin monogatari emaki even describes how a young sparrow, after intensive "discussions" with other birds, decides to leave his family and become a monk, hosshin (Fig. 136).462 Three charming scenes at the end of the scroll show the sparrow, clad in a monk's robe, devoutly kneeling while receiving ton- sure; on his way as a carefree wandering monk with a large straw hat and a bamboo staff; and finally in a simple straw-thatched hut, holding a rosary and invoking the name of Buddha. A truly moving testament to the faith that the absolute is revealed in the most humble form, and to the loving affection for the most common species of nature is Ikkyi Sbjun's "Eulogy for a Dead Sparrow" at the Hatakeyama Kinenkan, Tokyo (Fig. 138).463 In this "requiem", the eccentric Zen priest treats the bird like a disciple who has attained enlight- enment; in accordance with Zen Buddhist custom, he bestows a confirmation name on him, and even compares the death of the bird with Buddha's entry into nirvana: I nurtured a little sparrow and loved it very much. One day it suddenly died. My grief being extraordinary, I buried it with a funeral ceremony just as if it had been a person. At first I had called it Jakujisha, "Sparrow Attendant" And later changed the character jaku ["Sparrow"] to Shaku [Sakyamuni]. I also gave it the formal name, Sonrin, "Forest of Venerability". Hence, I commemorated this with a poem. Sixteen-foot burnished golden body, When he entered nirvana in the grove of paired saIa trees. He escaped the infidels' hands that kill or let live at will.

One of the most beautiful hahachi paintings is by Sesson Shukei (ca.1504-ca.1589). On the horizontal hanging scroll at the Tokiwayama Bunko, Kamakura (No. 50), the bird, not exactly over-endowed by nature with conventional beauty, is shown in "classical" profile view, as if Sesson had had a "portrait" in mind. The mynah bird was considered to be a markedly pleasant, jaunty, and loquacious companion, and was also favoured as a pet.467 In 1555, the 152nd abbot of Engakuji, Keisho Shuzui (1476-1557), added an inscription which mentions that the "painter created the hahachi in one single stroke of the brush". The Zen master also alludes to the famous sixty-four hexagrams canonized in the oldest Chinese oracle text, the "Book of Changes", Yijing, symbolizing the fundamental exis- tential situations. The inscription maintains that the fateful sanctions summarized therein apply to sages as well as to all kinds of birds, and thus also to this hahach6. In East Asia, the mynah bird is the bearer of good omen, and considered to be a zuichi, a "lucky bird". It is quite possible that the black plumage of the bird so beloved in Zen circles, like that of the crow, was associated with the black robe of common Zen monks. The erudite lit- eratus Gido ShOshin (1325-1388) hints at such an interpretation in the following humor- ous poem: I've watched you bathe for quite a while, old crow, And it's going to take some doing to get you white as a gull; Why not just stay your usual pitch-black self, And avoid giving the other birds reason to be suspicious?468 Gido ShOshin may well have meant these verses as a reminder to monks who might have preferred to wear colourful robes and thus assume a more aristocratic appearance. Quite possibly, he wanted to react against a tendency toward superficial pomp discernible in certain Zen circles of the capital at that time. Among the literary conventions of gozan poetry was the use of a row of crows on a branch or flying into the sunset. The subject was a metaphor for a group of black-clad Zen monks returning to their monastery at dusk after their long, daily routine of ritual alm begging, known as takuhatsu orjihatsu (Fig. 10). Some poets developed the image of a flock of flying birds further and compared it with the formal structure of a fluidly written line of a poem on a painting. 16. The Landscape: Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang The frequent occurrence of flocks of flying wild geese in one of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang", entitled "Wild Geese Descending to Sandbar", also has to be seen as a purely literary, impressionistic image. The first sets of the so-called Xiao Xiang baling, in Japa- nese Shdshd hakkei, were probably painted by Song Di (ca.1015-1080). The statesman, erudite natural scientist, and literatus Shen Gua (1031 -1095) once saw the painting series. Around 1090 he noted the titles of these "eight views widely known among con- noisseurs" in his "Casual Brush Sketches from [the Garden of] the Stream of Dreams", Mengqi bitan (chapter 17): Wild Geese Descending to Sandbar, pingsha yanluo Returning Sails Off Distant Shore, yuanpu fangui Mountain Market, Clear with Rising Mist, shanshi qinglan River and Sky in Evening Snow, jiangtian muxue Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting, Dongting qiuyue Night Rain on Xiao and Xiang, Xiaoxiang yeyu Evening Bell from Mist-shrouded Temple, yansi wanzhong Fishing Village in Evening Glow, yucun luozhao 189</page><page sequence="183">.gE na. . _ . Following Shen Gua's sequence, the Chan monk Juefan Huihong (1071 -1128) wrote eight poems shortly afterwards which have been recorded in chapter 8 of the "Medita- tions on Literature from the Stone Gate", Shimen wenzi chan. Huihong was apparently encouraged by the flattering remark of a confrere named Yan, perhaps Wuzu Fanyan (1025?-1104), to compose verses on the Xiao and Xiang themes: "Song Di painted Eight Views of excellent quality. People say he creates language without sounds. The Reverend Yan playfully said that I make pictures with sounds. Therefore I have taken each scene and composed a poem."469 The oldest version extant today is signed by Wang Hong (active ca.1131 -1161); the two handscrolls in the Art Museum of Princeton University were probably painted around the middle of the twelfth century.470 The subject of Xiao and Xiang, however, most likely goes back to the Tang Dynasty. In a eulogy on a new screen painted by an amateur painter by the name of Liu, who was a judge by profession, the celebrated poet Du Fu (712-770) suggests the possibility that the landscape depicted may be a representation of the two famous rivers: I have heard that you used to paint landscapes of your district, and now you yield to your inclination to paint interesting ideal landscapes. [...1 This painting satisfies spirit and heart, and it is clear that you are devoting yourself most earnestly to the art of painting on silk. [...] If this painting does not show a section of the rocky Xuanpu of the Kunlun Mountains, it might represent the region of the rivers Xiao and Xiang flowing by here. [...]471 Such landscapes full of poetry and characterized by atmospheric moods, by weather and light effects changing according to season, even according to the time of day, must have had particular appeal to the eyes and the spirit of Zen adepts. For here was nature reveal- ing herself at the same time in all her inexhaustible variety and unity, her timeless quiet- ude and motion. These were landscapes for the mind as well as for the eye, mappings of existential experience into which the enchanted beholder could transpose himself. In such sceneries, the viewer could experience the infinity and richness of nature, and the ceaseless flux in the stream of existence. One of the most beautiful ink paintings extant from any period - probably dating to shortly before 1170 - depicts such a scenery. It is a handscroll, more than four meters long, now in the Tokyo National Museum, entitled "Dream Journey on the Xiao and Xiang", Xiao Xiang woyou tu (Fig. 139)472 According to the colophons dated 1170/71, the otherwise unknown Chan monk Yungu Yuanzhao from Wuxing in today's Zhejiang Province commissioned the painting from an 190 Fig. 139 Dream Journey on the Xiao and Xiang, Xiao Xiang woyou tu, by Li from Shucheng (active mid- 12th century).

In delicately evanescent, aqueous greys, a wide panorama of rivers and mountains opens up before our eyes. The large areas of unpainted paper have an important function as integrating component of the overall composition of the painting. This blank ground sug- gests extended water surfaces, mist-shrouded ravines and valleys, as well as the vast- ness of the sky. The velvety softness of the painterly treatment with its richly modulated ink handling yields a unified atmosphere into which melt all individual elements. At the same time, it determines the flow of the movement in the painting from right to left based on undulating transitions and spatial intersections. Nowhere are there abrupt interrup- tions liable to create stagnation. The painter almost completely renounces sharp con- tours and precisely circumscribing line structures. Only when suggesting buildings, bridges, boats, and figures, he uses a delicate, subdued line drawing. Yet, such misty haziness is by no means amorphous. To be sure, if one enlarges a detail of the scroll, the washed and dabbed ink traces - in intimate counterpoise with the empty ground - do not reveal anything about the depicted object; but they bespeak all the more the imme- diacy of the creative act itself, and in turn are testament to the sensitive, spiritualised character of the artist. Contemplating this enchanting dream landscape, the Chan monk Yungu surely had no difficulty in satisfying his travelling urge while staying at home, wan- dering hundreds of miles in his mind, immersing himself in the happiness of the longed- for vision of Xiao and Xiang. "The character of fleeting evanescence retracting the defined into the indefinite, the shaped into amorphousness, and thus affording a vision of the ultimate origin";473 this 191</page><page sequence="185">character is an integral part of the two versions of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang" done toward the end of the Muromachi period by the painter-monks Tbshun and Sesson (Nos. 61 -62, Figs. 80, 140). Both works - Tbshun's eight hanging scrolls and Sesson's handscroll in the style of the Song master Yujian474 - are at the Masaki Bijutsukan, in Tadaoka near Osaka. By continuously loosening and abbreviating the formal structure, and by reducing the depicted objects to abbreviated hints, both artists have created works of great suggestive power, challenging the viewer to direct participation and stim- ulating his fantasy. In such paintings, only the barely necessary elements are brought to paper; but the sketch-like effect has nothing to do with our idea of a sketch: we are con- fronted with the definitive result of intense spiritual concentration in a spontaneous for- mulation. These painters were in no way concerned with any exact rendering of reality; what mattered to them was the capturing of the life core of things and their essence, the silent hearkening to the "reverberation of the life breath", qiyun, to use a classic term of Chinese art theory. The poetical theme of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang" has inspired Chinese and Japanese poets and painters again and again. The Song literatus monk Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?) wrote a series of eight evocative poems, and the Zen mas- ter Ikkyui Sbjun (1394-1481) also contributed poetic renditions of the Shosho hakkei, which were included in his Kybunshu, "Crazy Cloud Anthology".475 The literati painter Ike no Taiga (1723-1776) created a series of highly original interpretations of the theme in fan format which has been preserved in the collection of ShOhei Kumita, TokyO;476 and even the popular woodblock artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used the theme for some of their most successful landscape series. 17. Shigajiku: Scrolls with Poems and Painting In Japan, where landscape painting as practised by Zen Buddhist monks had been under strong Chinese influence ever since the fourteenth century, paintings depicting the four seasons, shiki sansuizu, had - beside the classic Xiao and Xiang theme - great appeal among Zen adepts. Their eyes and senses were fascinated by the cosmic forces and the atmospheric effects in the perennial flow of nature. Such landscapes brought to their minds on the one hand the concept of the Buddha Nature present in all things, and on the other hand they reminded them of the evanescing insignificance of their own self in the endless flow of being. Such ideas may have guided the painter-monk Sesson Shukei (ca.1504-ca.1589) in the creation of his magnificent masterpiece in small format "Wind and Waves" now at the Nomura Bijutsukan in Kyoto (No. 60). The painting bears the name seal of the artist in the upper left corner. A few sparse bamboo branches and a leafless old tree are bent in the raging storm. Behind the shoreline rising on the left, the straw-thatched roof of a house comes into view. The largest part of the bold composi- tion is taken over by blank ground. Delicate grey, diagonal washes suggest rain whipped through the air by the gale. In the foreground, a single wave, indicated by sparse lines and a wash in reserve, is clashing against the rocky shore. The striking focus of the paint- ing, however, is a solitary boat, battling the storm with inflated sails far away from the coast. Firmly brushed with energetic, dark strokes, it seems to be willing and able to resist the forces of nature. The painting has been interpreted as a work with autobio- graphical overtones, the solitary, but stable boat with its unwavering, upright mast a sim- ile for the painter in his personal difficulties and storms that he tried to fight at first; once he had become a monk, however, he succeeded in navigating around the rocky obsta- cles of life and steer an independent course away from the influential monasteries in Kybto.477 An unusual self-portrait at the Yamato Bunkakan, Nara, shows the bald-headed old master on a moonlit night in front of snow-covered mountains (Fig. 27). He is seated on a low bamboo stool covered with a rough fur, and above him Sesson brushed a short poem in which we read the following lines: Gone is the impulse that brought me; my boat is poled homeward. Moonbright water flows before a brushwood gate.478 Searching for a comprehensive, convincing artistic format to express their culture and erudition, their taste and their common interests, the "literati monks", bunlinsb, of the first half of the fifteenth century created a type of painting they called shigajiku, "scroll with poems and painting".479 On many of these narrow, extremely high hanging scrolls, the 192 474 In an unpublished paper, Frangois Louis has con- cisely investigated "Sesson's Involvement with the 'Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang"' (Written examina- tion for lic. phil. at Zurich University, Dec. 1991). 475 Xisou Shaotan Chanshi guanglu, chapter 7, Dai- nippon zokuzbky6, Vol. 122, p. 157c-d, and Yamato bunka, No. 41 (August 1964), p. 49, No. 890-906. 476 James Cahill: Scholar Painters of Japan: The Nanga School.

The main purpose of such scrolls was the documentation of gatherings among congenial friends, the convening of literary circles headed by esteemed and highly edu- cated abbots, such as were formed in Kyoto around the great Zen monasteries, the gozan. The attractive combination of writing and painting, of word and picture, of brush, ink, and paper were only of secondary concern. For the owners, such complex works of art had a special emotional value, since they were predominantly given to fellow monks as testament to friendly ties, in memory of times spent together, or as farewell keepsakes. This kind is called hdyuzu, "paintings of friendly visits", and sbbetsuzu, "farewell paint- ings". Many Japanese pilgrim monks came back from their study travels to China with such "farewell" pictures.480 A few years before 1446, a young monk by the name of Shikei left his monastery in order to return to the "capital", as Nanko Sbgen (1387-1463) writes; for the occasion, Shikei received a painting with farewell poems by six renowned Zen masters connected especially with Kenninji and Shbkokuji in Kybto (No. 54). The poems cover almost three quarters of the narrow hanging scroll entitled Shikei shbnen sobetsu. Kosei Ryuiha (1375-1446), who received the "inauguration document", zakumon, as 154th abbot of Kenninji in 1437 from the hands of Ashikaga Yoshinori (1394-1441, reigned 1428-1441), wrote the following verse in the scroll's upper centre for the young Shikei: The ebbing tide sees off the moon as it sinks below the water's edge You depart, / remain; tears wet my robe. Even the birds on the beach understand men's grief at parting; Following the boat, they fly off and scatter amidst the blue waves. Ryuha of the Yashakuhin'an.481 A solitary boat with wind-blown sail floats almost lost in the vast expanse of the lake. Accompanied by seven other people, the young monk sails toward unknown shores. Close to the lower edge of the painting, three wild geese are flying - perhaps they were startled by the passing boat -, while three others are still afloat on the waves. The painter has omitted any suggestion of far-away mountains or of a group of friends gathered for the farewell; the bold composition thus is imbued with a sense of floating evanescence and an openness toward all sides. By reducing the objects depicted to an absolute min- imum, ascetically limiting his pictorial means, as well as by concentrating the painting in the lower part of the scroll, the painter has subtly captured the melancholic feeling of loneliness and the sadness of leave-taking described in the poems. It is easy to imagine the pain Shikei must have felt at that farewell, and what the painting - plain in its appear- ance, but extremely complex in its contents and emotional dimension - must have meant to him later on. The painting Kanbaku so, "Monk Viewing a Waterfall", also was a farewell present of the shogunal art consultant, dobbshG, for a disciple (No. 58, Fig. 141). The scroll was painted by the "Studying Old Shingei in his fiftieth (according to the western calendar forty-ninth) year" and signed at the lower left edge. Geiami (1431 -1485) and three leading represen- tatives of the Zen clergy of Kybto dedicated it to the painter-monk Kenko Shbkei, also called Kei Shoki because he held the office of "registrar" or "secretary", shoki, at his monastery. He went from Kamakura to the capital in 1478, in order to deepen his spiri- tual studies with the renowned Zen masters of the metropolitan gozan, get acquainted with the important art collections, and be instructed in painting by competent masters. When Shokei was about to return to Kenchoji in Kamakura after a three-year stay in Kyoto, he was presented with this impressive painting, now at the Nezu Museum, Tokyo. A waterfall is rushing over a hermitage, protected inside a grotto, into a roaring mountain stream. On a bridge in the foreground, a monk with his servant is returning to the empty hermitage. This may well be a hint to the recipient of the painting and his return home. The three authors of the inscriptions, Osen Keisan (1429-1493), Gettb Shukyo (died 1500), and Ranpa Keishi (1409-1501), all highly learned in literature, were reminded by Gelami's painting of the celebrated waterfall at Lushan in the northern part of present- day Jiangxi Province, as well as of other famous mountains in China. Their verses con- tain allusions to poems of Li Bai (Taibo, 701 -762), Bai Juyi (772-846), and Su Shi (Dongpo, 1036-1101).482 During the Muromachi period, "Viewing of a Waterfall" became a classic theme of landscape painting inspired by Chinese models. Other shigaiiku often 193</page><page sequence="187">IL~ We a:&gt; ft getty aw s Ars-s * . * . X a't I - a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 011 show a hermitage, a studio, or a pavilion at the shore of a lake or a river in the seclusion of the mountains. However, the mountains are never familiar native ones, but the far- away, idealized peaks of China. Most Japanese monks never saw that scenery; but they knew it all the better from eyewitness reports, literature, and painting. Thus Osai, active in the late fifteenth century, even painted an extremely detailed and accurate view of "West Lake", X~hu, on a pair of large six-fold screens (No. 63). The Tbfukuji monk Kbshi Ehb, who had been in the Ohan monasteries near Hangzhou on Nanshan and Beishan from 1432 until 1436, was also reminded of the picturesque landscape at the famous West Lake when he saw the "Small View of Lake and Mountain", painted by Shbkei Ten'yo most likely shortly after 1460 (No. 56); Eh6 inscribed the painting and mentions the resemblance to Xhu. The elegant estate in the midst of plum trees and bamboo may well have reminded him of the residence of the Song poet Lin Bu (967-1028), a literatus who was most at ease on Gushandao, the "Lone Mountain Island", in West Lake, under blossoming plum trees and among cranes.

I saw the willows of the immortal Su [Shi, 1036-1 101] and gazed out over plum trees of the scholar Zheng [Lin Buf. The nobleman's ancestral shrine, citang, and his grave stele were lying broken among the grass. Now when I look at this scroll, I can visualize the master exactly, who four hundred years ago preferred the pure fragrance of spare plum branches to the jade tablet and cap of a high official. The Honorable Fan [Zhongyan, an eleventh century official] once said: "It is more important to have the nobleman in the southeast than the court. " From this one may per- ceive the subtleties of this painting: it not only gratifies the eye for the time being, but can also move the heart after several hundred years. I consider writing and painting as a boat and a chariot that carry away human hearts. Therefore I feel I could wish for nothing else in this life if I might drift on the lake, viewing blossoms, drinking 'jade wine' Idjiu, and visiting monasteries with this man. But we can never again see the ancient people; so I have just recorded this. Impromptu verse by Eho.483 Shokei Ten'yUs composition is most likely a late work of the artist. It is characterized by open vistas and atmospheric clarity, the sharp-edged rocks and mountains painted partly in staccato structural brushwork, shunpd, partly in broad washes, boku'un. Ten'yu's landscape paintings exerted great influence on the style of Gaku'o Zokyu, active around 1500,484 as a comparison with a scroll at the Masaki Bijutsukan bearing two inscriptions by the Zen monks Shitsti Shuryo (before 1458-after 1487) and Ryo'an Keigo (1 425-1514) shows (No. 57) 485 But in contrast to Gaku'o's mannered straw-thatched "Vista Pavilion at the River in the Mountains", Shokei Ten'yu depicts his buildings with loving attention to detail and great precision of line, emphasizing the specifically Chinese character of the architecture. Only few shosaizu, "pictures of a [scholar's] studio", as this type of shigajiku is called,486 show an actually existing study at a specific, unmistakable location. Most of them depict idealized hermitages, some of which have been given names inspired by literary conno- tations, such as the "Study of Spring Expectation", Taishunken, sometimes also called "Study of Blossom Anticipation", Taikaken. The atmospheric scroll at the Idemitsu Bijitsukan, Tokyo (No. 53), which must have been painted before 1419, is attributed to the painter-monk Shubun of Shbkokuji on the basis of a dubious seal most likely impressed at a later date. The character ken in the poetic name of such a hermitage often refers to a subsidiary building or living quarters within a monastery's precinct to which older masters would retire. There would be a shosai, "writing study", usually with a view of the monastery's garden. There, the retired master might listen to the chirping of birds, to a gurgling stream, or to the sound of the wind in the pines and the bamboo. Such optical and acoustic impressions inspired the bunjinso in their artistic endeavours. This is borne out by the poem of the Zen abbot Daisho Shuchb (1348-1419), 17th abbot of Shbkokuji and 87th abbot of Nanzenji: Green grass grows atop small hills; spring awakening is close. The trees do not have leaves yet; they stand amidst the melting snow. Anticipating the [plum] blossoms is like awaiting elegant guests. I have swept the floor and lit the incense; presently, I should devote myself to writing. SanshO Ddjin Shuch6.487 The celebrated orchid painter Gyoku'en Bonpb (1348-after 1420), too, writes about the impending arrival of spring, although in a more personal way, in his inscription at the lower left edge of the scroll: The long awaited spring wind has come and sweeps away the [grey] shimmer from my temples. Where else but among the immortals could I find pure joy? Near the grove, crimson blossoms are sprinkled among the branches, Bursting forth all at the same time, it seems, for me.

In order to escape the busy world of metropolitan monastic life at least in his spirit, he would hang a shosaizu in his private study with the intention to project his thoughts and his desire for quietude into the painting. One of the earliest extant shosaizu is the Kei'in shbchiku, "Hidden Cottage by a Mountain Brook", at Konchi'in of Nanzenji in Kybto and traditionally attributed to Minchb (1351 -1431) (No. 52, Fig. 142). In the pre- face to the scroll, dated to 1413, the renowned Zen prelate Taihaku Shingen writes, two years prior to his death, that the monastery had become a noisy and annoying place; but that one had to encounter the bustle of the market place with a heart as tranquil as water, and thus such a scroll was a "painting for the heart", kokoro no ga.489 Six more promi- nent contemporaries of the literary Zen clergy in Kybto, among them again Daishui Shuchb (1348-1419), Gyoku'en Bonpb (1348-after 1420), and Daigaku Shisi (1345- 1423), contributed colophons strongly influenced by Chinese models, as was the pain- ting itself.490 Zen luminaries such as these literati monks not only shared their poetic interests and their high esteem as abbots of the influential gozan, but they also enjoyed the patronage and privileges extended to them by Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428, reigned 1394-1423). The programmatic character of the shigajiku, "scrolls with poems and painting", and the aspiration toward a complex Gesamtkunstwerk have taken pion- eering shape in the shosaizu. Only rarely did the sinophile Zen painters of Japan depict the beauty of their own native scenery. A view of Mt. Fuji, a perennial subject of the later woodblock print artists, is therefore a rarity in early Zen painting. One of the exceptions is a painting by Chilian 196 Fig. 142 Hidden Cottage by a Mountain Brook, Kei'in shbchiku, attributed to Kichizan Minch5 (1351-1431). Detail.

Shinko, showing the grandiose silhouette of the 3776 m high volcanic peak at the bor- der of the two old provinces of Suruga and Kai (No. 55). The eccentric Chu'an Shinkb was active in Kamakura around the middle of the fifteenth century, and is thus likely to have seen the "Sacred Mountain" of Japan with his own eyes. The painting shows Mt. Fuji towering majestically behind the misty Suruga Bay; above a hazy veil of clouds tower the characteristic three eruption cones at the peak of the mountain. In the foreground, a few grassy knolls, a few roofs, stencil-like trees, and the top of a bamboo grove rise above the mist. A few fishing boats on the water and people carrying loads tell the viewer of busy everyday life. In the foreground, a sandy spit of land protrudes into the painting from the left, densely overgrown with pine trees bent by wind and age. This is the celeb- rated "Pine Grove of Miho", Miho no matsubara. The 3.2 km long sandbank, situated northwest of Shizuoka, provides a natural protection for the harbor of Shimizu; at the same time, it offers a spectacular view of Mt. Fuji on clear days. Since ancient times, this view has moved painters and poets to ever new eulogies. A disciple of Cho'an Shinkb, Kenkb Shbkei (active ca. 1478-1506/1518), also a painter-monk at Kenchbji in Kamakura, seems to have been equally fascinated by the immaculate beauty of Mt. Fuji. A hanging scroll at the Tokyo National Museum is convincingly attributed to him, although it lacks signature and seal.491 However, a long inscription dated to 1490 from the hand of the 159th Kenchbji abbot Shijun Tokuyo provides evidence concerning the origin of the hand- scroll. The painting was probably commissioned by Ashikaga Masa'uji (1466-1531), who at that time was in charge of government business at Koga in the old province of Shimbsa (today's Ibaraki Prefecture). In his capacity as shbgunal administrator, Koga kubb, he was especially intent on bringing about peace among the rival parties of that region. The young politician loved "the grandeur of Mt. Fuji, commissioned an artist to capture it in a painting, and had it mounted as a hanging scroll". He then sent the scroll to the Zen mas- ter Shijun Tokuyo with the request for an inscription.492 H.B. 197</page><page sequence="191">PART TWO: MASTERWORKS OF ZEN ART</page><page sequence="192">I Figures of the Traditional Buddhist Pantheon 199</page><page sequence="193">1 Sakyamuni Emerging from the M ountains By Liang Kai (active first half 13th century). Shussan _,ak, Hanging scroll. Ink and colour on silk. Shussan Shaka 119 x 52 cm. Agency for Cultural Affairs, Bunkachb, Tokyo. Important Cultural Property, JOyc Bunkazai. This celebrated scroll by Liang Kai, dating to the first half of the thirteenth century, is an outstanding masterpiece and at the same time one of the oldest extant rendi- tions of this theme. Marked by his ascetic exercises, the Buddha stands in an arid winter scene. Sakyamuni's eyes are not looking anywhere specific; they seem to be turned inwards in enraptured concen- tration. A light wind from behind is rippling the seam of the garment and blowing it forward, as if to encourage the hesitating saviour in his difficult decision to return into the world. The subdued red of the garment, the lips, and the arm band is the only colour in this painting in ink on silk. The three-quarter profile of the figure, the fluttering robe, and the path gradually descending toward the foreground give the complex composition a clear direction toward the right. And yet, the Buddha fig- ure between the diagonally crossing lines of the composition is the latent center and focal point, the only striking vertical ele- ment in the painting. Parallel to the silhou- ette of the foreground rock declining toward the lower right runs the border of the snowy path along the suddenly rising, strangely intangible rock wall. The wall is intersected by a rocky mountain side cut- ting across the complete painting from the lower left to the upper right. Like the upper part of the leafless, ghostly tree, that diag- onal runs perpendicular to the other two main compositional lines of the foreground rock and the path. Only the thick, gnarled, bizarrely-shaped old tree trunk with its spreading roots, jutting out of the scroll's left edge, breaks this subtly conceived, asymmetrical composition of two pairs of parallels opposed to each other at a right angle. The painter has created a sense of almost unfathomable depth by this mas- terly staggering of the compositional ele- ments and by clearly differentiating their 200 formal treatment. Wet, broadly applied washes of delicate, hazy greys immerse the gorge, especially in the upper part, into a vague veil of mist. Against this misty ground, the bare branches and twigs of the tree in the closest spatial layer are sharply contrasted. Short, T- and cross- shaped stroke combinations executed with a pointed brush and jet-black ink have a certain abstract quality related to calli- graphy. The precise articulation of the forms is thus decreasing from the fore- ground to the background. It leads from linear, graphic values to broad, painterly ones, and these finally dissolve in the empty ground. On the left, near the massive old tree trunk, the scroll bears the signature of the artist: Yuqian tuhua Liang Kai, "Painted in the service of his Majesty by Liang Kai." Thus, the work dates to the period when Liang Kai was active as court painter of the Imperial Art Academy, Hanlin tuhua yuan. Among the monks of the Chan monaster- ies in and near Hangzhou, he had many congenial friends who would write inscrip- tions for his paintings, such as the 37th abbot of Jingcisi, Beijian Jujian (1164- 1246), and Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263), abbot of a number of other important Chan institutions in that region. This fact not only throws light on the good relations between the leading Chan clergy with the artists at court, but it also shows the open-mindedness of the court as con- cerns religious themes and new artistic forms of expression at the Imperial Art Academy, an institution generally devoted to the classic traditions of secular paint- ing. This explains the unusual formal dis- cipline of the artistic presentation, the carefully calculated composition, the pre- cision in the handling of the figure - a characteristic occurring but rarely in Liang Kai's oeuvre -, the interest in detail, and the use of colour.

That the three hanging scrolls did not belong together originally can also be seen in the different quality of the paper: the Shussan Shaka scroll has a mat yellowish tint, while the plum blossom scrolls are on a somewhat colder, whitish- grey paper. The left scroll with the branch partly immersed in water is probably a Chinese Song Dynasty work which Haku'un Egyo brought back in 1279 from his journey to China. The right scroll with the plum blossoms in the moonlight was most likely painted by a Japanese artist in the last two decades of the thirteenth cen- tury. The paper he used for the delicate work was imported from China and embellished with a flower basket decora- tion in a kind of batik technique, rosen. The three works are, however, most clearly connected with each other by Haku'un Egyo's inscriptions on all three of them. The year of Haku'un's death thus provides a secure terminus ante quem for the triptych. The poem of the fourth Tofukuji abbot on the Shussan Shaka scroll is the following: A leader of all living beings - Condescending compassion for the "Three Existence Levels" sangai To move about unfettered in the secular world - Would it not be better to spend one's time in the mountains instead? Inkokushi, the "Master of the Hidden Valley" Egyo reverently [wrote] this verse. In several details, the monochrome ink version at the Rikkyoku'an of TOfukuji reveals a certain copy-like constraint and hesitating reserve. The anonymous painter 202 cannot hide insecurities in his handling of the Buddha figure, evident especially in the inorganic distortion of the figure turned toward the left in a three-quarter profile; in the indecisive brushwork lacking energy; as well as in the undifferentiated handling of the ink in the robe. No doubt the Japanese painter tried to emulate the so-called "abbreviating brush technique", jianbi, brought to perfection by Liang Kai in the first half of the thirteenth century. But he lacks the Chinese master's spon- taneous freedom and ingrained assurance in his use of the pictorial means, and the Shussan Shaka thus looks rather like the result of a groping search. Closer scrutiny of the scroll reveals a fine line of pre-drawing with a pointed brush in darker ink under the broad grey brush- strokes. This line, especially evident on the head and the shoulder, is quite similar to the one seen in the portrait sketch of Haku'un Egyb at the Rikkyoku'an, a work that is related in its physiognomical type, especially around the chin, the mouth, and the nose. Indeed, Sakyamuni's emaciated face is almost reminiscent of the ascetic physiognomy of the Japanese Zen master. Could it be possible that both works are by the same artist, maybe a monk active at the atelier of Tofukuji, or Haku'un Egyo himself? At any rate, the painter did not have enough self-confidence to render the figure of the Buddha using the technical means of ink painting at his own will. Rather, he seems to have closely followed a Chinese model dating to the first half of the thirteenth century. Even an insignifi- cant detail, such as the rock protruding into the painting from the right edge, appears as a hesitating, hardly perceptible intimation. Haku'un Egyo stayed in China between 1266 and 1279 to further his studies; it would be quite reasonable to assume that, on his way back to Japan, his luggage contained, beside written cer- tificates and other documents of his ecclesiastical connections and accom- plishments, a Song painting showing the emergence of Sakyamuni from the moun- tains. Such a painting might well have served as the model for the version at Rikkyoku'an. If this theory is correct, the painting would date between 1279 and 1298. In the Rikkyoku'an version of the Shussan Shaka theme, the head of Sakyamuni is surrounded by a round halo indicated in reserve with a thin ink wash. It is striking and maybe even significant that the large majority of Japanese Shussan Shaka paintings show the Buddha with a halo, while Chinese painters hardly ever used this iconographical detail. To be sure, this does not allow any conclusions as to the subject of the painting: it is not possible to say that the enlightened Buddha was always represented with a halo, and Sakyamuni returning un-enlightened from the mountains without one. Inscriptions on paintings by Zen Buddhist monks reveal controversial opinions on this ques- tion. H.B.</page><page sequence="196">Wi i' .-; 7' , vmlEn ; |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~r.

Inscription by Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323). Hanging scroll. Ink on Paper. 65.9 x 30.2 cm. Fujita Bijutsukan, Osaka. Cf. Nos. 21, 25, 26, and 38. The Bodhisattva "whose nature is enlight- enment" has reached the highest religious wisdom by passing through many exist- ence levels. Thus purified, however, Ava- lokitegvara renounced of his own will to become a Buddha and resolved to help un-enlightened living beings on their way toward redemption. Avalokitegvara or Guanyin in Chinese and Kannon in Japa- nese, the Bodhisattva of inexhaustible compassion, is among the few orthodox redeeming figures in the traditional pan- theon of Mahayana Buddhism to have been taken over into the thought and iconography of Zen Buddhism. Painters commissioned by this school prefer to represent him in a plain white robe as Balyl Guanyin or Byaku'e Kannon. In that unadorned manifestation he is shown in this painting, too, turned toward the left in three-quarter profile. The ideal- ized figure in front of the empty ground seems to be hovering in that other-worldly sphere of absolute transcendence that eludes the empirical world of experience. In his other-worldly sublimity, his abundant wisdom, and his unselfish compassion, the "Lord who looks down [on the suffer- ing of the world]", as Avalokitetvara's name can be translated, comes to meet the believer who trusts in his redemptive power. His gentle face, the naked feet, the pearl necklace on his chest, and the round halo around the head are drawn in pre- cise, hair-thin lines; the long robe, drawn over the high hair knot and showing the black hair framing the face, but hiding the hands, is represented with highly disci- plined, firm contours in a somewhat thicker line. This austere, subdued, and highly objec- tive language of line lends the white-robed Guanyin an almost glass-like transpar- ency, giving the idealised Bodhisattva fig- 204 ure an ethereal beauty of abstract formal quality. The pictorial means are reduced to the barest minimum of essential compo- nents. Line and empty surface, volume and void enter into a wordless dialogue with each other in this painting. This mas- ter of "linear painting on white", baimiao (Jap. hakubyb), uses his sensitive, ex- tremely sparse handling of the line to com- municate the Bodhisattva's asceticism. As a result, the painting is reminiscent, in its graphical lucidity and precision, of a mono- chrome woodcut or a stone rubbing. Indeed, printed black and white versions of the theme may have served the artist as inspiration or model. The gifted Chan painter-monk Jueji Yongzhong, a disciple of Zhongfeng Ming- ben (1263-1323), lived in the Huanzhu'an near Suzhou at the beginning of the four- teenth century. In 1302, when Mingben took leave from the monastery he had founded in 1300, Yongzhong took over his master's administrative duties. As we know from a signed work showing a seated Balyi Guanyin at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Yongzhong was particu- larly skilled in the unmistakably cool, dis- tanced style of figure painting shown in the Fujita Museum's picture. Both scrolls bear eulogies by Zhongfeng Mingben. However, the style of handwriting on the Fujita Museum's rendition deviates from the prominent Chan master's usual style. Since the two pure line drawings show stylistic affinities, an attribution to Jueji Yongzhong seems plausible. A third, closely related painting, depicting the standing Bodhisattva Avalokitetvara, most likely also by Jueji Yongzhong, in the col- lection of Soshiro Yabumoto, Tokyo, also bears a colophon by Zhongfeng Mingben.

Seisetsu Shbchd, 1274-1339), dated 1338. Hanging scroll. Ink on silk. 86.2 x 41.7 cm. Nanzenji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juyd Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 7, 16, and 39. Bodhisattva Manju~rT (Jap. Monju), the "auspicious youth", as the name might be translated, is - like Avalokitesvara - one of the oldest redeemer figures of Mahayana Buddhism. Vivid religious fantasy has en- dowed him with a rich panoply of attrib- utes and roles in the course of time. As companion of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, and as embodiment of the highest insight and wisdom, he served Zen adepts as spiritual model and as the embodiment of the "Holy Monk", shdsb, i.e., the monk that has attained absolute enlightenment. In this capacity, cult im- ages of Monju Bosatsu came to be placed especially in the Monks' and Meditation Halls of Zen monasteries. In that context, it was natural to depict Monju not neces- sarily in idealized rapture with sumptuous, princely garb and precious jewelry as in orthodox Buddhist art, but to show him in his benevolent incarnation as a plain monk with shorn head and wearing a simple priest's robe. The anonymous master of this scroll shows him as a meditating monk, Shdsd Monju, seated on a richly ornamented pe- destal in front of an overhanging rock and reverently admired by two representatives of the secular world. One of the two for- eign-looking figures, a bearded man with long, black hair and a straw hat, offers Monju a basin with bizarre, petrified coral or a gnarled root, a bonkei or bonsai ar- rangement. The incarnation of holy beings on another level of existence or in another identity, henyakushin, is often depicted in East Asian Buddhist art. No doubt, the subject of outward transformation refers to the inner identity of Bodhisattva and monk, as already the Lotus Sutra says: "Internally [he is] a Bodhisattva, externally a ?ravaka 206 [monk]", in Japanese shdmon, "one who listens to the voice". The monochrome ink painting on silk is characterized by its high degree of techni- cal perfection and precision, its sensitive elegance, and the vibrating 6lan of its sub- tle ink lines. The delicate washes convinc- ingly evoke volume and surface textures. The painting is thus in the tradition of the "linear painting on white", hakubydga, practised especially during the late thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries by such painters as Wang Zhenpeng (ca.1280- 1329). The colophon of the painting is dated to 1338. Contrary to East Asian convention, it runs from left to right, and thus against the line of sight of the main figure, in latent contrapuntal response. It was written by Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339) one year before his death. He was then abbot of Nanzenji in Kyoto, where the scroll has remained to the present day.

Inscriptions by ShojD Ryut6 (1429-1498), dated 1493, and by a certain "Old Kant6" (or Kanjos6). Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 98.3 x 21.8 cm. Ryosoku'in, Kenninji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, Juyi Bunkazai. Like subjects such as the "Three Vinegar Tasters", sansan, and "The Three Laughers of the Tiger Ravine", Kokei sansh6, the theme of the "Three Creeds" was meant to symbolize the essential unity of the three great East Asian doctrines, i.e., Bud- dhism, Confucianism, and Daoism. The ecumenical ideal of their inner identity, strikingly summarized in the term sankyc itchi, the "Three Creeds [spring from] One Source", found its artistic expression in this subject. In this painting, attributed to the painter-monk Josetsu, the founders of the three doctrines are shown standing close to each other on the empty ground: in front, the bald sage Confucius, behind him, in frontal view, the bearded, dark- haired Buddha 8akyamuni characterized as Indian, and on the right the roguishly laughing Laozi with long, streaky hair. In Chinese painting, this theme goes back to the ninth and tenth centuries; the earliest extant versions, however, are works of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279). In Japan, paintings of the "Three Creeds" became popular among adepts and artists of Zen Buddhism during the Muro- machi period (1333-1573). In the upper part, the narrow hanging scroll bears an inscription by ShojO Ryuto dated to 1493, and above it another one by the unknown "Old Kantb", Kantbsb. However, the painting and the two inscrip- tions are on three separate sheets of paper that were subsequently mounted together. Therefore the exact date of the work cannot be determined on the basis of the colophons. Only the inscription of Kantbsb mentions Josetsu as painter of the scroll. It further states that the pur- ported artist got his name Josetsu from the esteemed Zen abbot and gozan litera- tus Zekkai Chushin (1336-1405). The name might be translated as follows: "The greatest skill 'is like', jo, 'clumsiness', 208 setsu." The inscription of the otherwise unknown Kantbso is thus an important document concerning the relationship between Josetsu and Zekkai Choshin, both of whom were active at Shbkokuji in Kybto. The "abbreviating brush technique", gen- pitsu, used in the figures of this painting can also be seen in Josetsu's most fam- ous work, the so-called Hyotan namazu'e or Hyonen zu at Taizbin of Mybshinji in Kybto. The painting shows how an old man at the shore of a mountain creek is trying to catch a slippery catfish with a narrow-necked gourd, a parable for the use of unsuitable means on the way toward enlightenment. The stylistic re- semblance further reinforces the claim of Kantbsb that the "Three Creeds" scroll is by the hand of Josetsu. H.K.

Inscription by Mieweng Wenli (1167-1250). Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 83.5 x 33 cm. Myoshinji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 11. Early Bodhidharma paintings of the el- eventh and twelfth centuries show the Indian founder of Chan in China accompa- nied by Huike, his first disciple and official successor. They are scenic representations that could be called "ordination paintings", since they record the transmission of the patriarch's insignia, the robe, and the alm's bowl. From the thirteenth century on, how- ever, the half-figure portrait, hanshinzb in Japanese, became the clearly dominating type of portrait to depict Bodhidharma, who had turned into a super-human, virtu- ally messianic figure. Most images of this type show the Indian patriarch as a bearded man with broad shoulders and a short neck. He often wears large, exotic earrings and his lid-less eyes stare fiercely at the viewer. The patri- arch is shown either bald-headed or with a robe pulled over his head. Most of these characteristics can be traced back to the much-embellished biography or to the nu- merous legends surrounding the patriarch. The hypnotic stare of Bodhidharma's wide- open eyes has two possible explanations: he may be depicted while glaring at a rock wall during his famous nine-year meditation at Shaolinsi; or the bulging eyes may refer to the legend that Bodhidharma cut off his lids in anger when his eyes once closed during that ascetic feat. The legend goes on to say that where the eyelids fell to the ground, a tea bush grew miraculously. And indeed, tea was used in Zen circles to over- come fatigue during meditation, zazen. The Myoshinji portrait of Bodhidharma, no doubt one of the most impressive exam- ples of this type, is done on paper with a few powerful strokes of the "abbreviating brush", jianbi, and contrasting velvety washes. The painting probably came to Japan during the Middle Ages and has 210 been the central scroll of a triptych there for centuries. Two paper strips were added on top and at the bottom of the painting, in order to equal the size of the two flanking scrolls. They show Budai and Fenggan painted by Li Que, the only works known by that artist. The Budai scroll is signed in the lower left corner. The anonymous painter of the Myoshinji image used a bristly, rough brush, maybe a "rice straw brush", warafude in Japanese, to depict the garment. The brush was swept across the paper in quick strokes, leaving blank portions of the paper bet- ween the ink traces, so-called "overflown white", feibai, (Jap. hihaku). The face, how- ever, is painted with a soft brush. A similar technique can be seen in an approximately contemporary half-figure portrait of Bodhi- dharma with an inscription by Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249) at the Hatakeyama Kinenkan in Tokyo. Above the portrait, a four-line stanza or gatha by Mieweng Wenli (1167-1250) runs against the line of sight of the patriarch, i.e., from left to right. In it, the eminent prelate refers to two episodes from the life and the mysterious "afterlife" of Bodhidharma: his unsuccessful encounter with the Emperor Wu of Liang, and the miraculous return of the Indian master of meditation across the Central Asian desert after his death: He murmured only: "I don't know". How could he understand Chinese, when he spoke only in a barbarian tongue? If Old Xiao [Emperor Wu] had had more blood under his skin, He would have pursued [Bodhidharma] beyond the flowing sands [of the Central Asian deserts] in search of the Dharma. The fire wood gatherer of [Mt.] Tianmu. The uppermost of the three seals contains the two characters Tianmu which also appear in the signature; the middle seal in the shape of an archaic bronze vessel shows the first part of the Chan master's name, Mieweng, and the lower seal reads Wenli. Apart from a Buddhist hymn in a Japanese private collection and a poem at the Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, this eulogy is the only example extant from the brush of Mieweng Wenli. His highly original handwriting is characterized by a brittle fragility and the tendency of the characters to lean toward the right. He was a disciple of Songyuan Chongyue (1132-1202) and became the 37th abbot of the great Chan monastery on Tiantongshan, and the 35th abbot of Jingcisi near Hangzhou. Mieweng Wenli is considered to be an extremely intellectual representative of the Chan clergy, familiar with both classic literature - such as the famous "Book of Changes, Yijing, and Neo-Confucianism. The learned Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the actual founder of Neo-Confucianism, is said to have visited a lecture of the young Wenli about funda- mental questions of Buddhist thought.

Inscription by Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (Jap. Seisetsu Shdchb, 1274-1339), dated 1326. Hanging scroll. Ink on silk. 94 x 43.4 cm. Izumi'shi Kubbso Kinen Bijutsukan. Important Cultural Property, Jiyo Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 4, 16, and 39. Bodhidharma's nine-year meditation at Shaolinsi "Facing a Rock Wall", Menpeki Daruma, is one of the fundamental themes of Zen painting. There are representations in which the famous episode of the Indian founder patriarch is elaborately depicted, often in a landscape setting and showing the full figure of the protagonist. In contrast, the half-figure portraits emphasize the exotic facial features of Bodhidharma, showing his tenacious character and his iron will to persevere in his rigorous ascetic exer- cises. For this painting on brownish silk, the anonymous artist used a stiff, hard brush. Especially the garment, but also the hair of the bearded Indian monk are rendered with rough brushstrokes containing "over- flown white", hihaku. The face, however, is done in fine, flexible lines and delicate ink washes. The Chinese Zen master Qingzhuo Zheng- cheng, who wrote the inscription, came to Japan in the eighth month of 1326. He stayed first in Hakata, Fukuoka Prefec- ture, and moved to Kybto in the first month of the following year. The painting must date from Zheng- cheng's sojourn in Hakata, since the inscription is dated to the tenth month of 1326. The fifty-two-year-old Seisetsu Shocho, as the master's name is pro- nounced in Japanese, extols the Bodhi- dharma, and refers to the patriarch's hard- ships during his nine-year meditation in front of a rock wall on Mt. Song north of Dengfeng in Henan Province. 212 It is safe to assume that this painting, from the early phase of Japanese ink painting, i.e., the beginning of the fourteenth cen- tury, was created by an artist trained in a Zen monastery at Hakata or nearby.

Inscription by Yishan Yining (Jap. Issan Ichinei, 1247-1317). Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on silk. 101.6 x 40.8 cm. Jodoji, Shizuoka Prefecture. Cf. Nos. 20 and 37. Beside the theme of Bodhidharma facing a rock wall at Shaolin Monastery, the le- gend of his miraculous crossing of the Yangzi river on a reed is frequently de- picted in Zen painting. Tradition has it that after his arrival in China, where he wanted to spread his new doctrine, Bodhidharma was granted an audience with the Emperor Wu (464-549, reigned 502 -549) of the Liang Dynasty. The Emperor asked questions concerning the new faith, but he could not understand Bodhidharma's gruff answers. Seeing the Emperor's incomprehension, Bodhidharma realized that the conditions for preaching his faith did not exist at the court. He dealt abruptly with the Emperor and left the southern Chinese court without asking for leave. Going north, he is said to have crossed the Yangzi on a reed. The earliest literary records concerning this event, however, go back only as far as the twelfth century. In one version of the Biyanji, the "Green Cliff Collection", com- monly known as Biyanlu, we read: "Since the Emperor [Wu of Liang] was not agree- able, he [Bodhidharma] left the empire. Deeply hurt, this old man crossed the river and went to the kingdom of Wei. Later, it was said that he snapped a reed and crossed the river [on it]. Perhaps this was not entirely accurate, but a form of prais- ing him." The Wujia zhengzong zan, "Eulogies of the Five Houses in the True School", compiled in 1254 by Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?), also mentions that "he broke off a reed and crossed the river". Another source, the Shishi tongjian by Ben Jue dating to the year 1270, states: "On the 19th [day], he consequently departed from Liang. He broke off a reed, crossed the river, and hastened north, and on the 23rd [day] he was at the border of Wei." But in that text, too, the mysterious crossing of the river is not exactly clear. 214 Earlier sources, such as the Jingde chuandeng Iu, the "Record of the Trans- mission of the Flame from the Jingde [era, 1004-1007]", or the Chuanfa zhengzong ji, the "Record of the Transmission of the Law in the True School", dedicated to the Northern Song Emperor Renzong in 1062 and completed one year earlier, do not mention anything about a reed. Perhaps the legend is based on a misunderstand- ing, the wrong interpretation of a passage in a text, or on an embellishment with the intent to save Bodhidharma's honour after his failure with the Liang Emperor Wu. On the Jodoji scroll, the bearded, bald patriarch throws back his head as if he were glaring backwards in anger. A large, round halo marks him as a saint sur- rounded by the lustre of enlightenment. His facial features, the fluttering garment, the priest's staff, shakujo, the reed stalk, and the waves of the river are painted in fine, flexible lines. This style is different from the wet washes, unsen, and power- ful brushstrokes usually preferred by Zen painters. Perhaps the Jodoji scroll was created after a model that was in turn influenced by the "style of linear painting on white", hakubybtai. This brushline tech- nique was a favourite style for Arhat paint- ings among Buddhist artists of the Jiangnan region in China. Although the technique seems somewhat awkward in certain passages of this painting, the work is an important early example of Zen Buddhist figure painting in Japan. The terminus ante quem for the Jodoji scroll is 1317, the year in which Yishan Yining, the writer of the partly-illegible colophon, died. The inscription refers to Bodhidharma's "ten thousand mile jour- ney from the West [India]", and alludes to the cryptic, unsuccessful conversation with the Liang ruler, as well as to the unusual "turning of the head" which the anonymous painter has chosen in con- trast to most other versions.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 65.7 x 32.6 cm. Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo. In this extraordinary painting, the artist never lifted his brush from the paper while painting the garment. He began below the chest and surrounded the face in two ovals. Then he guided the brush in gradu- ally decreasing horizontal loops over the right and the left leg, continued the brush- stroke in a wide arch over shoulder, head, and legs, and finally brought it to an end at the lower left. Paintings done in this cir- cling technique used to be called kurukuru no mi'ei, "Round-and-Round Venerable Images". The colophon was written by Shokai Reiken, who had retired to Taiko'an at Tofukuji in his seventieth year. At the end he indicates his age: eighty (seventy-nine according to Western calculation), and thus the scroll can be safely dated to 1394. The poem, an extremely personal statement of Reiken, the 43rd Tbfukuji abbot, cannot be found in his collected works entitled SekibybshG, "Rock Screen Anthology", compiled posthumously. In a commentary concerning such painting inscriptions, there is a reference to such a "Round-and-Round Venerable Image". Moreover, in an introduction to a eulogy on a portrait Reiken mentions that he resem- bles Bodhidharma. It is therefore quite possible that the old Reiken created a self portrait in the guise of the Indian Zen patri- arch. Indeed, the bearded face of the fig- ure - painted with an extremely fine brush in contrast to the thicker line of the gar- ment - shows unusually individual traits. One might easily interpret it as either the face of Bodhidharma or of the aged Zen monk Reiken. ShOkai Reiken began his Zen studies under the Chinese master Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-339) at Kenninji in KyOto. In 1343 he set out on a seven-year journey to China to further his studies. 216 After his return, Reiken enjoyed the patronage of the two Ashikaga Shoguns Yoshiakira (1330-1368) and Yoshimitsu (1358-1408). He was the Zen teacher of the famous painter-monk Mincho (1351- 1431) who is thought to have led an im- portant painting atelier at TOfukuji. From several inscriptions by Reiken on paint- ings by Mincho we know that the 43rd abbot of Tofukuji shared his artistic inter- ests with Mincho. The suggestion that the Zen prelate may have been active as painter as well is, therefore, not far- fetched. H.K.</page><page sequence="210">... . .............. ....... .... . .. .... . ..

Ink on paper. 35.4 x 64.3 cm each. Tokyo National Museum. Important Cultural Property, Juyb Bunkazai. The two paintings, now mounted as hang- ing scrolls, were originally parts of a hand- scroll bearing a colophon by the Yuan lit- eratus Yu Ji. The two old patriarchs in deep meditation are rendered in a highly unconventional style using bold, rough lines applied by a coarse brush and broad, grey washes. The bald-headed masters of meditation are seated - collapsed, really - in frontal posture with their eyes closed. The patriarch on the right scroll leans his chin on the back of his right hand; the elbow of the right arm rests on the right knee. The robe has slipped down from the shoulders, baring most of the torso; the left arm, however, remains hidden under the agitated folds of the garment. The patriarch of the left painting leans com- fortably on the neck of a tiger slumbering at his side. The soft fur of the tiger is dabbed on to the paper with a rough, dry brush, and strikingly characterized by somewhat wetter, black stripes. The peaceful companionship of monk and tiger in meditative immersion conveys fun- damental Buddhist ideas about man and nature. On the left edge, the scroll with the tiger has a signature which reads: "On the eighth day of the eighth month in the first year of Qiande [era, 963], Shi Ke from western Shu [Sichuan] painted the images of the two patriarchs harmonizing their minds." In addition, there are Imperial seals such as the one of the art-loving last Northern Song Emperor Huizong with the reign titles Zhenghe (1111-1118) and Xuanhe (1119-1125), as well as one of the Southern Song Emperor Gaozong with the reign title Shaoxing (1131 -1162). How- ever, the two paintings are certainly not originals by Shi Ke dating to the tenth cen- tury, but faithful copies probably dating to the end of the Southern Song or the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty. 218 One of Shi Ke's names is Zizhuan. He hailed from Shu in western China, modern Sichuan Province. After the Song had conquered Shu in 965, Shi Ke moved to the new capital Bianjing, modern Kaifeng in Henan Province. There he earned fame and great esteem: the Imperial court com- missioned wall paintings from him for the restoration of the Xiangguosi, one of the most important metropolitan monasteries, and offered him a post at the Imperial painting academy, the huayuan. However, Shi Ke declined the offer and asked for permission to return to his home province. He died on the way back to Shu. Traditional sources tell us that Shi Ke's painting belonged to an unconventional school of monochrome ink painting, prac- tised in spontaneous, untrammeled free- dom by eccentric artists, yipin, since the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Face, hands, and feet of figures were painted with fine brushstrokes. For the garments, however, a rough, sometimes even wild, brush technique was used. The copies at the Tokyo National Museum showing the two patriarchs are representative examples of this style. H.K.</page><page sequence="212">-----.- - -- -- - - . ---.

Inscriptions by Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263); datable to between 1256 and 1263. Pair of hanging scrolls. Ink on paper. 104.8x 32.1 cm. Myoshinji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 6. This pair of hanging scrolls originally formed a diptych. However, when the two paintings entered the collection of the Ashikaga Shbgun Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) in Kybto, they were used as the flanking scrolls in a triptych with the Bodhidharma image inscribed by Mieweng Wenli (1167-1250). Only the Budai painting is signed in the lower left corner by Li Que. The stylistic affinity between the two paintings, how- ever, indicates beyond doubt that the scroll with Fenggan and his tiger is also by Li Que. Unfortunately, we know hardly anything about this gifted painter. Only Xia Wenyan mentions him shortly in chapter 4 of his "Treasure Mirror of Painting", Tuhui baofian (preface dated 1365), saying that Li Que "studied Liang Kai's 'linear painting on white', baimiao". The passage does not clarify whether Li Que was really a direct disciple of the great Song master. Li Que's dates as known from painting inscriptions at least do not exclude this possibility. The remark of Xia Wenyan, however, indicates Li Que's stylistic debt to Liang Kai, the first figure painter to practise the style of the "abbreviating brush", jianbi, popular in Zen circles and used so successfully by Li Que in the present two works. Fenggan, usually depicted by Zen painters in the company of a tiger, is a figure in the stories about the eccentric, half-legendary hermits Hanshan and Shide. Li Que depicts the bearded old man in frontal posture, leaning on his gnarled staff painted in wet, jet-black ink. Vigorous, pale grey brushstrokes summarize the fall of his wide monk's robe, while the tiger, cuddling up to his master from behind, is done with a dry brush. Especially the raised tail shows the bristly hair of the fur. 220 Budai, a Chinese wandering monk of the Tang Dynasty, was originally called Qici. In this painting, he is shown in profile, look- ing up toward the right. With a few swelling and ebbing strokes of the flexible brush, Li Que succeeds in showing us Budai as a portly, affable monk who holds his paunch while laughing. Extremely sparse and dexterous accents convin- cingly characterize his cheerful face, the fingers of his hand, and the right foot peeking from under his long robe. In the upper part, each scroll bears a colophon running from left to right, each with three seals of the renowned Chan prelate Yanqi Guangwen (1189-1263). Powerful, striking accents and variations of the line achieved by changing pressure of the brush give his handwriting a robust and highly individual note. For his painting inscriptions, Guangwen usually preferred a flexibly taut form of "semi-cursive writ- ing", xingshu or gyosho in Japanese, such as in these two scrolls. Guangwen's sig- nature mentions Jingshan as his resi- dence; it can therefore safely be assumed that he wrote the eulogies in the last years of his life, after he became abbot of the Wanshou Monastery in 1256.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 87 x 34.2 cm. Tokyo National Museum. Important Cultural Property, Juyb Bunkazai. Cf. No. 47. According to an early eleventh-century source, the Chinese Chan monk Xianzi studied under Dongshan Liangjie (807- 869), the founder of the Caodong (Jap. Soto) school. It is said that Xianzi did not have any permanent residence, and that he liked to keep the company of the peo- ple in the streets. For his daily living requirements, he fished for shrimp, ebi, and a kind of mussels, shijimi, in the nearby lakes and rivers. In this painting "Reverend Prawn Fisher", Kensu Oshc, is standing on a narrow strip of land below an overhanging rock from which dangle branches and vines. He is barefoot; under his loose upper garment he wears a ragged, mended pair of pants held together by a black cord. With his left arm he holds a long bamboo pole to which the catching net is attached. He has just caught a shrimp and is holding it aloft with his right hand in joyous and grateful tri- umph (Fig. 2). The bald-headed old shrimp catcher sym- bolizes the unadulterated, natural joy of life and spontaneity characterizing the Zen spirit freed from all clerical conventions. For this untrammeled Zen master, every- day life itself is already a religious exercise. Everywhere, the phenomena of this world offer him countless possibilities to strive after his final goal, i.e., enlightenment. In the sound composition of the painting, the overhanging cliff, the dangling vines, and the central figure of the shrimp catcher emphasize the vertical axis. The horizontal bamboo pole, the sandy shore, and the suggested water surface form the harmonious balance to these vertical ele- ments. The lower right corner of the painting bears two red seals. The upper, square 222 relief seal shows the name of the artist, Ka'o. The small seal below is usually read Ninga. None of the accepted paintings by Ka'o bears any inscriptions. The high quality and the unmistakable Zen spirit of his paintings, however, have led scholars to believe that the artist was the high-ranking Zen monk Ka'o Sbnen. At first Sbnen studied under Nanpo Jbmin (1235-1308) at Kenchbji in Kamakura. In 1319, he travelled to Yuan China with a group of renowned Japanese Zen monks, returning only seven years later, on the same boat as Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339) and his confreres. In Kybto, Ka'o Sbnen was first appointed 16th ab- bot of a gozan monastery, the Manjuji; 1343 he became the 28th abbot of Kenninji; two years later, he was inaugur- ated as abbot of Nanzenji. He died on the 24th day of the eighth month in 1345. Ka'b is one of the earliest representatives of monochrome ink painting, suibokuga, in Japan, and thus, together with Moku'an Rei'en, one of the most important artists of that period. H.K./H.B.

Pair of hanging scrolls. Ink and colours on silk. 36.5 x 19.7 cm each. Minoru Hosomi Collection, Osaka. Hanshan (Jap. Kanzan) was a legendary Chinese monk during the Tang Dynasty. He lived in the solitude of the mountains and was friendly with Shide (Jap. Jittoku), a hermit connected with the Guoqing Monastery on Tientaishan in present-day Zhejiang Province. The two eccentric "jesters of Zen" are among the most pop- ular subjects of figure painting. It is not certain that Hanshan is actually the author of the famous anthology Hanshan shi, "Poems of the Cold Mountain", often translated into Western languages. Since the Song Dynasty, painters have not ceased to depict the cheerful pair with their roguish, youthful faces either to- gether in single hanging scrolls, or as dip- tychs. In these humorous paintings, the joyful laughter, the wild hair, and the rag- ged clothes of the duo suggest their ec- centric, un-worldly character which made them lead a life free of monastic discipline. Zen monks liked to have such paintings near them to imagine themselves in the role of these unfettered hermits, sharing their world of ultimate freedom to which they aspired. The painter of the scrolls is Bokkei (died 1473) with the sobriquet Saiyo. He shows Kanzan and Jittoku in agitated, powerful ink lines, accentuating the volume and the folds of the rumpled garments with dilute washes. The faces, feet, and hands are enhanced by a delicate flesh-coloured hue. Kanzan, immersed in the text of a handscroll, has his hair in a double knot as was the custom for boys during the Tang Dynasty. Jittoku holds a fan decorated with calligraphy in his right hand, and points up in the air with his left. Both fig- ures are prankishly laughing. Bokkei Saiyo was a painter-monk of the Soga school, which was connected with 224 Daitokuji in Kyoto. Bokkei also painted two extant portraits, chinzo, of lkkyo Sbjun (1394-1481), dated to 1452 and 1453, both with inscriptions by the popu- lar Daitokuji abbot. This shows not only that Bokkei was active around the middle of the fifteenth century, but also that he was in contact with one of the most important Zen masters of his time (Fig. 20). Both scrolls bear the seals Bokkei and Saiyo in the outer lower corner. H.K.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 54.1 x86.7 cm. Shoin'an, Nanzenji, Kyoto. It is not exactly clear how far back the subject of the "Four Sleepers" dates, and who first painted it. Since the thirteenth century, however, the theme seems to have belonged to the basic repertory of Chinese Chan artists. The earliest known reference to the theme is a poem in the "Recorded Sayings" of Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) which the eminent master of meditation composed for a lost painting depicting the "Four Sleepers". However, the oldest versions extant today date to the first half of the fourteenth century, among them the well-known masterpiece of Moku'an Rei'en (died 1345) at the Mae'da Ikutokukai, Tokyo, and the out- standing baimiao version of an anony- mous Yuan master at the Tokyo National Museum. In the Shbin'an painting, Kanzan, Jittoku, their mentor Bukan, and his steadfast companion, the tiger, are cuddled up to each other in deep slumber. The peaceful, quiet scene emanates the gravity of the Zen spirit as well as the pure harmony of creation, since the unifying power of the Buddha Nature is dormant in all living beings. One is under the impression that the delicate balance of the four figures would waver at the slightest movement of any of the four sleepers. The brushwork of the painting shows no professional polish. It is refreshingly simple, even amateurish, and the painter was most likely a monk who painted as a dilet- tante in the best sense of the word. The plain monks' robes are rendered in angu- lar brushstrokes in dark ink, together with lighter grey lines, while the striped fur of the frontally shown tiger is characterized by short dabs with a dry brush over a gray wash. 226 Near the lower left of the painting's edge, there is a rectangular relief seal showing the two characters of the painter's name ShOsei. An extremely high landscape scroll with the title "Night Lodging Near the Maple Bridge" at the Tokiwayama Bunko, Kamakura, bears the same seal, and has an inscription by the Zen monk Sesshin Tohaku (1383-1459). This has led some scholars to believe that Shusei may be the artist-name of Sesshin Tbhaku, who was active in Kybto in the patriarchal line of Muso Soseki (1275-1351). In 1446 he became the 63rd abbot of Shbkokuji, and a year before his death the 129th head of Tenryuji. No doubt the painting tradition of Josetsu and Shubun was still alive then at Shbkokuji, and Shusei was most likely one of those painter-monks who kept alive the heritage of the great ink painters as best their talent would allow. Landscape paintings with the ShOsei seal, among them a series of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang" (Jap. Shdshd Hakkel) in the Hosomi Collection, Osaka, support this view. H.K./H.B.

Hanging scroll. Ink and colours on silk. 115.9 x 48.5 cm. Nanzenji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, Jujyo Bunkazai. In his "Original Assembly of the Five Flames", Wudeng huiyuan, of 1252, the renowned abbot Dachuan Puji (1179- 1253) recorded the encounter between the Chan monk Yaoshan Weiyan (751- 834) and the high-ranking Confucian court official Li Ao (died ca.844). During this meeting, Li Ao, the governor of Langzhou and friend of the anti-Buddhist Tang offi- cial Han Yu (768-824), asked the cele- brated Chan master for instruction. In the course of the conversation, Li Ao asked: "Which is the [right] way [toward enlight- enment]?" Yaoshan Weiyan was silent for a moment, pointing upwards with one hand, downwards with the other. Li Ao did not understand the cryptic gestures, so that the wise Chan master finally added: "The clouds are in the sky; the water is in the vase." That critical moment is captured in this painting. The subject, very popular in Chan circles during the Song Dynasty, belongs to the type of paintings of "Zen encounters", chanhui (Jap. zen'e), which show eminent Zen patriarchs in exemplary didactic conversations with representa- tives of the secular world. On a fenced-in terrace, a huge pine tree on the left towers over the scene of the painting. Yaoshan Weiyan is seated in a bamboo abbot chair behind a magnificent stone table. He is wearing a rumpled monk's robe, while Li Ao is reverently stan- ding opposite him in his formal garment of a Chinese official. Opulent stone tables of this kind were quite common in the parks of a noble estate or in the gardens of pros- perous monasteries. On the table, a vase with a blossoming plum branch, two sutra boxes, an open ink stone, and a cup are all neatly arranged. In the foreground, a lotus-shaped stone basin is standing on a pedestal. 228 This painting in ink and colours on silk does not show the style of the "abbreviat- ing brush", jianbi, but rather the meticu- lously descriptive painting technique of the Imperial painting academy during the Song Dynasty. The lower right corner of the painting bears the signature of the artist Ma Gongxian. According to standard Chinese sources, Ma Gongxian was an uncle of the celebrated Ma Yuan, who was active around 1200 at the Imperial Court, bring- ing the elegant style of the Southern Song academy to full bloom. During the Shao- xing era (1131 -1162), Ma Gongxian is said to have held the high rank of daizhao, an "artist-in-attendance", of the monarch in the "Forest of Brushes", the Han/in Im- perial Painting Bureau. In the Huaji buyi of 1298, however, Zhuang Su records that Ma Gongxian was a grandson of Ma Yuan, and thus active as court painter not in the middle of the twelfth, but during the thir- teenth century. The somewhat stiff style of the painting would support the latter the- ory. Nor does the general composition suggest the evocative spatial depth and perfection of the so-called "one-corner composition", henkakukei in Japanese, as it became customary after Ma Yuan.

Inscription by Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (Jap. Seisetsu Shocho, 1274-1339), dated 1325. Hanging scroll. Ink on silk. 37.8 x 28.8 cm. TenjO'in, Myoshinji, Kybto. Cf. Nos. 4, 7, and 39. Mazu Daoyi (709-788), a Chinese master of meditation, continued the tradition of Nanyue Huairang (677-744). One day, the recluse Pang Yun, originally an adherent of Confucian thought, visited him and asked: "What sort of man is he who is not the companion of all things?" Mazu Daoyi answered: "I shall tell you if you can drink all the water of the Western River in one gulp!" Upon this, Pang Yun is said to have attained enlightenment. Not to be tied to things indicates a state of utter freedom and total non-attachment. Such a state cannot be explained in a lo- gical discourse, since explanatory thoughts and words themselves would constitute a form of attachment. Therefore the wise Chan master made his answer to the question of the insistent recluse depen- dent on an absurd condition that was impossible to fulfill. Illustrations of such conversations and meetings between wise Zen patriarchs and laymen in search of enlightenment are called chanhui tu or zen'e zu, "paintings of Zen encounters". The anonymous painter has represented the scene, not in a landscape setting, as was customary in the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, but on empty silk. Thus, the viewer's complete attention is directed toward the figures. In reverential posture, Pang Yun kneels in front of Mazu Daoyi, who is seated on an abbot's chair and accompanied by two acolytes. The en- counter between the man of the secular world and the enlightened, majestically dignified master of meditation emanates a feeling of almost monarchic sublimity. The dense structure of meticulously drawn lines and the absence of washes indicat- ing volume lend the painting a strongly graphic character. This austere style of 230 painting seems to have been widely used in the Chan monasteries of the Yuan Dynasty. The eulogy of Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274-1339) is written in a rectangular block above the figures, commanding al- most the same attention as the painting. It is dedicated to an advanced, probably Japanese pilgrim monk by the name of Don'an [?]shun, who occupied the "chief seat", shuso, in the Monks' Hall. The Chi- nese Chan abbot wrote the inscription shortly before his departure to Japan in 1325, while he was still residing at the Zhenjing Monastery. His disciple Don'an may well have accompanied him to Japan and brought the painting with him.

Ink and light colours on paper. 183 x 113.5 cm. Sainenji, Aichi Prefecture. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 59. In a famous episode, Bodhidharma, the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism in China, spent nine years in deep meditation in front of a cliff at Shaolin Monastery on Mt. Song. During that period, the Chan adept Huike visited the Indian patriarch and asked to be admitted as disciple. But Bodhidharma ignored him at first. Only when Huike spent an icy winter's night outside and finally cut off his arm to show his determination, did the severe Indian master show mercy and accepted him as a disciple. Sesshu's version of this moment - of extreme importance to any Zen adept - shows the two figures in striking profile with thick, powerful brushstrokes of little modulation. Especially emphasized are the realistic facial features of the two bearded monks with sharp eyes. Complex curvatures characterize the inside of the cragged rock grotto. In contrast, the ground is rendered with a few horizontal lines, black dots, and washes, all convinc- ingly suggesting untouched snow. The painting creates a secluded atmosphere surrounding the two figures, isolating them completely from the outside world. Quite consciously, Sesshu renounces spatial depth, so important in his other paintings. Although he is most celebrated as a painter, Sesshu's essential nature was that of a Zen monk. Thus, he devoted all his power and his prodigious artistic tal- ent to render the decisive encounter between the first two Zen patriarchs on Chinese soil in truly monumental format. The signature on the left edge reads: SesshG, "[Occupant of the] First Seat" dai'ichiza, at the Tiantong [Monastery] of Siming reverently painted this picture at the age of seventy-seven. 232 Thus we know that the painting was done in 1496; it is a mature masterwork of the famous painter-monk's late period. In 1467 or 1468, Sesshu had travelled to China, and obtained the rank of "Occu- pant of the Chief Seat", shuso, during meditation sessions in one of the most important Chan monasteries, the Tian- tong Jingde Chansi on Mt. Taibai. Evi- dently, Sesshu was still proud of this great honour decades later when he signed this painting. The brushwork of the signature, like the painting itself, shows no signs of weakness due to old age. The jet-black regular script, kaisho, is firmly structured and lucid. The two seals show the artist's names, SesshO and Tcyc. An accompanying document states that the local Daimyb, Saji Tamesada, gave the scroll to Sainenji when that monastery was established in 1532.

Ten round paintings (diameter 14 cm each) mounted as a handscroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 32 x 181.5 cm. Shokokuji, Kybto. Cf. Nos. 41 and 53. The first sets of "Ten Oxherding Pictures", jugyuzu, seem to have originated in China around the middle of the eleventh century. During the fourteenth and fifteenth cen- turies, a set of the theme with paintings and text, going back to the Chan master Guo'an Shiyuan (active around 1150), was widely circulated in Japan and existed in several handwritten and painted versions, as well as in printed editions. In that work, the steps on the steep road toward en- lightenment are presented in the following similes: 1. Looking for the Ox 2. Seeing the Footprints of the Ox 3. Seeing the Ox 4. Catching the Ox 5. Herding the Ox 6. Returning Home on the Back of the Ox 7. The Ox Forgotten, the Man Remains 8. Both Man and Ox Forgotten 9. Returning to the Fundamental, Back to the Source 10. Entering the City with Hands Hanging Down These ten stages of the herdboy handling the foolish ox were frequently illustrated in hanging scrolls and handscrolls. The round format was often preferred, since the circle as a geometric figure without beginning or end includes the elimination of all opposites into absolute unity, i.e., the "true void", shinkO. It points to the deep "insight into one's own essential nature" and symbolizes the fundamental charac- ter - devoid of shape and colour - of all liv- ing beings, simply but significantly alluded to in Zen painting by the empty ground. Thus, the eighth stage, "Both Man and Ox 234 Forgotten", i.e., all differences and oppo- sites have been dissolved in ultimate clar- ity, is represented here, too, by an empty circle. The return to the initially clear and pure source of the true teaching is sym- bolized in the ninth stage by the "Three Pure Ones", bamboo, plum, and rock. Finally, the enlightened adept goes among the people, relaxed - "with hands hanging down" - and far above worldly concerns, cheerfully and without any want. The work at Shokokuji is the oldest extant Japanese jugyuzu. It is attributed by tradi- tion to Shubun, who was active as official painter, goyo eshi, of the Muromachi Bakufu government during the first half of the fifteenth century. However, judging from the rigid spatial composition and the somewhat formalized details, the hand- scroll seems to date rather from the end of the fifteenth century. The "Oxherding" parable seems to have been of special importance at Shokokuji: already toward the end of the fourteenth century, the outstanding gozan poet-monk Zekkai Chushin (1336-1405) wrote a set of poems for an "Oxherding" cycle which is still extant at the monastery in ten hanging scrolls.

Wood with remains of pigment. H. 78.3 cm. Hbkokuji, Ehime Prefecture. Important Cultural Property, JCiyb Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 24 and 36. This portrait sculpture, chinzb, depicts Chikotsu Dai'e, also known under his posthumous title "Master of Meditation of the Buddha Permeation", Buttsu Zenji, in strictly frontal posture. Most likely, the portrait dates to the years immediately fol- lowing Chikotsu Dai'e's death. The sculp- ture was constructed by joining several blocks of Japanese cypress wood, hinoki, together in the so-called yosegi tech- nique. Under the remains of the extant pigment one can see, especially at the front part of the overhanging robe, hori- zontal seams where the wood is joined. The face and the backpart of the head, as well as the neck and the hands were carved separately and joined to the body. Only slight traces remain of their flesh- coloured pigmentation. The collar, er, of the robe and the borders of the wide sleeves hanging down almost to the seam of the robe, were originally embellished with ornamental flowers on a slightly relief ochre ground, odo, especially with "peony vines", botan karakusa. Remains of pig- ment on the stole, kesa, show that it was originally decorated with "lotus arab- esques", renge karakusa, and a "triple jewel motif", sanben hbjumon. No doubt these ornaments admirably captured the sumptuous material of the kesa - fastened by a cord to an octagonal ring on the left side of the chest - in the original state of the sculpture. The abbot holds an admonition staff, kybsaku or keisaku. Unexpected blows with the staff - often sounding more frightening than they actually are - admin- istered on the shoulder served to induce spiritual concentration and correct phys- ical posture in students faltering during the tiring meditation exercises. However, the most impressive part of this - and most other - chinzb is the head of 238 the broad-shouldered, corpulent Zen prelate. With an almost hypnotical glare from his inlaid crystal eyes, gyokugan kannyu, Chikotsu Dai'e stares at the viewer, making his posthumous title of "Master of Meditation of the Buddha Permeation" easily understandable. Chi- kotsu Dai'e must have been an extremely severe man of great willpower. His eye- brows at the root of the nose are energet- ically contracted into a "lion's nose", shishibana, and two deeply carved creases run from the wings of the nose to the cor- ners of the mouth. The round, bald head with the fleshy cheeks and ears, the dou- ble chin and the short, thick neck lend the figure its squat character. It has been reported that relics of the por- trayed founder abbot or "mountain opener", kaisan sharia, were found inside the sculpture. There were allegedly re- mains of his beard and fingernails; a rock- crystal reliquary, suishb sharito; and a Chinese edition of the "Lotus Sutra", Hokkekyb, in small print dating to the Song Dynasty. According to the tradition of Hokokuji, where the portrait is kept today, the mo- nastery was founded by Chikotsu Dai'e in the seventies of the thirteenth century. It is thought that the sculpture was originally made for Daiji'in, a cloister of Tbfukuji where Dai'e's tomb is located, and that the image was transferred to Hbkokuji in November 1853. The high quality of the sculpture would certainly suggest that it was made in the capital rather than in remote Shikoku. Little biographical information is available. Chikotsu Dai'e was born in Ise in 1229, a descendant of the famous warrior hero Taira Kiyomori (1118-1181). At first, Chi- kotsu Dai'e studied esoteric Buddhism on Hi'eizan. During a religious discourse with the experienced Zen abbot of Tbfukuji, Enni Ben'en (1202-1280), he realized that the tolerance of Zen, with its simultaneous discipline in monastic practice, was supe- rior to his own religious convictions and to the rigid doctrines of Tendai and Shingon Buddhism. Thus, he decided to "change his robe" and to continue his studies among the monks of Tofukuji in Kyoto under the guidance of its great founding abbot Enni Ben'en. Probably some years after the death of his master in 1280, Chikotsu Dai'e returned to his native Ise and founded the monas- teries Annybji and Daifukuji. One year before his own death, in 1311, the aged prelate was called back to Kybto and appointed to serve as the ninth abbot of Tbfukuji. On the 22nd day of the eleventh month the following year, Chikotsu Dai'e died at the age of eighty-three. In his last moments, he mustered all his remaining strength and put his spiritual testament, yuige, to paper. Apart from a "Commentary to the Maha- Vairocana SOtra", the Dainichikyo kenmon, Chikotsu Dai'e's two most famous literary works are the two-volume Kobokushu, "Collection of the Withered Tree", and the "Secret of the Ten Oxherding Parable", Jugyuketsu. The former is an anthology of didactic maxims written in Japanese, kana hbgo, which Chikotsu Dai'e compiled in 1283 at the request of a Zen Buddhist nun; it was printed in 1641. His Jugyu- ketsu was edited in 1402 with a postscript by GuchO Shugyu (1323-1409), and prin- ted in 1645.

Wood with remains of pigment. H. 76 cm. Nanzen'in, Nanzenji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 8 and 37. This outstanding chinzd, probably carved shortly after Yishan Yining's death, pre- sents one of the most important Chinese masters of meditation. A major participant in the introduction of Zen to Japan, he helped the new school to gain its cultural, literary, and artistic influence. At Nanzen'in, where the portrait statue is revered to this day, Yishan Yining found his last resting place. The Emperor Kameyama (1249- 1305, reigned 1259-1274), responsible for the founding of Nanzenji, is also buried there. Although Yishan Yining was seventy years old and seriously ill in the tenth month of 1317, he led a procession as head, hitsu, to Nazen'in with the ex- Emperor Go Uda (1267-1324), a fervent admirer of the Chinese prelate. Shortly afterwards Yishan Yining died, after the monarch had visited him on his death bed on the 24th day of the same month, and after he had written his "departing verse", yuige. The sculpture, originally painted, is made of Japanese cypress wood, hinoki. Several blocks of the wood are joined together in the yosegi technique. The statue is hollow inside. The eyes, made of rock-crystal, are inlaid from inside the head, gyokugan kannyu. From 1306, Yishan Yining suffered from an eye ail- ment, and one cannot help feeling that this is expressed in the serious, melan- choly look of the master, who was never quite happy in Japan. The abbot is seated with crossed legs in meditational posture. His plain monk's robe and the kesa, hung over his left shoulder with an intricately knotted ribbon tied to a decorated ring, fall over his knees in deep, vertical folds. In his right hand, he holds an admonition staff, kydsaku or keisaku, with which he would administer his disciples well-meant blows to make them overcome their 240 fatigue and further the process of enlight- enment. Yishan Yining came from a family sur- named Hu in Taizhou in the old province of Linhai (present-day Zhejiang). He en- tered a monastery as a boy and studied various Buddhist doctrines before he de- cided to devote his life to Chan. Beginning in 1283, Yishan Yining studied especially under Yuxi Ruzhi, who, in 1294 proposed him as his successor at Guanyinsi on Mt. Putuoluo. Later, he spent time at the great Chan centres of Mingzhou on Mt. Ayuwang and Mt. Tiantong. Yishan Yining enjoyed the patronage and confidence of the lib- eral Mongol ruler Chengzong (reigned 1295-1308), who put him in charge of Buddhist affairs in Zhejiang. Chengzong presented Yishan Yining with a precious brocaded robe and bestowed on him the title "Great Master of the Wondrous Com- passion and Magnificent Crossing", Miaoci hongji dashi. In 1299, the successor of Khubilai Khan on the throne sent the diplomatically gifted Chan master to Japan together with Xijian Zitan (1249-1306) in order to renew old contacts; for eighteen years, since the second, aborted Mongolian invasion attempt, formal relationships between the mainland regime and Japan had been severed. After landing in Hakata, the monks were at first arrested on suspicion of espionage and kept confined at Shuzenji on the peninsula of Izu. However, they were soon released and rehabilitated. HOjo Sadatoki (1271 -1311), the regent of the military government in Kamakura, appointed them as abbots at two of the most important Zen monasteries in Japan: Yishan Yining was inaugurated as tenth abbot of Kenchbji, and Xijian Zitan as sixth head of Engakuji. When the ex-Emperor Go Uda heard of the -extensive learning of Yishan - among other things he intro- duced the Japanese to the neo-Confucian thought of Zhu Xi (1130-1200) - he invited him to Kyoto in 1313 and made him the abbot of Nanzenji. Yishan's exacting teachings, intellectual capacity, and especially his literary erudi- tion and talent were greatly appreciated not only by the Zen clergy, but also by the Imperial court and the aristocracy. He is considered the father of gozan bungaku, "Literature of the Five Mountains". The day after Yishan Yining's death, ex-Emperor Go Uda bestowed upon him the title of a "National Master", kokushi.

Wood with remains of pigment. H. 82.5 cm. Seiunji, Yamanashi Prefecture. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 3, 25, 26, and 38. Zhongfeng Mingben was one of the most important and influential masters of me- ditation. In China as well as in Japan, he was highly regarded not only in Zen circles, but also among Emperors, scholars, poets, and artists. Among his admirers and closest friends were the celebrated poet Feng Zizhen (1257-after 1327) and the great painter, calligrapher, and Han/in scholar Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322). The well-preserved portrait statue at Seiunji, carved out of several blocks of Japanese cypress, hinoki, is characterized by the marked sculptural contrast be- tween the smooth, sensitively modelled face with its bright inlaid rock-crystal eyes, gyokugan kannyG, and the agitated, pow- erfully molded folds of the garment. In several aspects, the statue is a remark- able work of Japanese sculpture: it is of outstanding artistic quality, a striking por- trait of the important Chinese Chan mas- ter with all his characteristic qualities; at the same time, it is dated and signed; moreover, it must have been carved after painted portraits, sketches, or reliable eyewitness reports, for the artists never met their model in person. Finally, the por- trait is testament to the almost limitless, enduring popularity and reverence en- joyed by Zhongfeng Mingben among Ja- pan's medieval Zen circles. Most likely the sculpture was commis- sioned by the Zen abbot Gbkai Honjb (died 1352). Together with several other Japanese pilgrim monks, among them Enkei Soyt (1285-1344) and Mu'in Genkai (before 1310-1358), Gbkai Honjb had been in China from 1318 until 1326, where he studied under Zhongfeng Mingben. Emulating his revered meditation master, in 1348 Gbkai Honjb built a monastery in a secluded valley of the old province Kai on a mountain that he named Tenmokuzan 242 (Chin. Tianmushan). He called his new Zen institution "Monastery to Live in the Clouds", Seiunji, expressing his wish to be living undisturbed in solitary reclusion. Perhaps, Gokai Honjo intended to conse- crate a portrait statue in his new residence at the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the great Chinese master's death, which was also his ninetieth birthday, for the sculpture was completed on the ninth day of the fourth month in 1353. This information is given in a red inscrip- tion inside the neck of the separately carved head. The two sculptors are iden- tified by their ecclesiastical ranks and names: Hokkyo, "Dharma Bridge", Injun and Hogen, "Dharma Eye", Inko. The statue is thus the joint work of the two Buddhist sculptors or busshi, who are also responsible for the Sakyamuni statue at the same monastery. Other statues extant by Inko are an image of the Bodhisattva Fugen dated to 1347 at Hozoji in Tochigi Prefecture, and a Hokan Amida figure of 1349 at Zendbji in Fukuoka. Gokai Honjo did not live to inaugurate the Zhongfeng Mingben statue at Seiunji him- self. He died on the 27th day of the sev- enth month of 1352, nine months prior to the completion of the work. A portrait sculpture at Seiunji also dated 1353 is a memorial to the founding abbot. While still alive, Gbkai Honjb probably supplied the two Japanese sculptors with reliable material concerning the famous Chinese master of meditation, perhaps even a chinzo he may have received from Ming- ben himself. Otherwise, the artists could hardly have known such details as Mingben's missing small finger of his left hand, burned off as a Buddha sacrifice. H.B.

Early 15th century. Wood with remains of pigment. H. 65.2 cm. Jisai'in, Tenryuji, Kyoto. Cf. Nos. 33, 41, and 45. The portrait statue at Jisai'in of Tenryuiji depicts the illustrious Zen master Zekkai Chu-shin, considered - together with his friend Gido Shucshin (1325-1388) - to be the most prominent representative of gozan literature. The two monks are often called "The Shining Double Jewels", sbheki, of the gozan bungaku movement. The sculpture is made of Japanese cypress, hinoki, of which several blocks were joined together in the yosegi tech- nique. The eyes are inlaid with rock-crys- tal, gyokugan kannyu. Only traces of the original pigmentation are left. Most likely, the sculpture was carved soon after the death of the master, at the beginning of the fifteenth century. The face of the sculpture emanates the determined, un- compromising character of this proud man, who could be dismissive and gruff, sometimes even daring to resist instruc- tions by official authorities. At times, Zekkai Chu-shin led the life of a scholar and poet recluse away from the capital, disappointed at the political disorder, his disagreement with the Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimitsu (1358-1408, reigned 1367- 1394), and the unworthy factional quarrels among the disciples of his teacher Muso Soseki (1275-1351). Toward the end of the fourteenth century, however, he took an active and decisive part in metropolitan Zen in his capacity as soroku, "Registrar General of Monks", to whom all monaster- ies and the clergy of the extensive gozan network were subject. The anonymous sculptor has rendered Zekkai Chu-shin seated in the conventional posture with his legs crossed and his hands in his lap in the "seal of meditation", zenjb'in. The master's head is large and oval. Deep creases in the cheeks and at the corners of the mouth characterize the sagging facial skin of the old, bald-headed 244 prelate. Smaller, horizontal lines show the furrows in his high forehead. The forceful chin and the determined mouth are espe- cially striking as individual traits. It would seem that Zekkai Chu-shin was cross- eyed. Over the monk's robe, he wears a kesa on a cord knotted to an octagonal ring. The robe hangs over his knees in deep diagonal and V-shaped folds, in con- trast to the smooth surface-planes of the robe on the torso and on the long sleeves. The statue, originally at Shokei'in, a clois- ter founded by Zekkai Chu-shin, was sold, along with the building, to the city of Kobe. In 1941, the portrait was brought to Jisai'in at Tenryuiji in Kyoto, together with the printing blocks of the Shbkenkb, the two-volume anthology of the master, con- taining 163 poems and 38 prose pieces. Two years later, the sculpture underwent careful restoration work.

Ink on paper. 13.4 x 9.3 cm. Rikkyoku'an, T5fukuji, Ky5to. Important Cultural Property, Juyd Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 2 and 32. This small, most impressive portrait sketch shows Haku'un Egyo, also known as Inkokushi, "Master of the Hidden Valley", the fourth abbot of Tofukuji and founder of Rikkyoku'an in 1294, a cloister of Tbfukuji. Probably the sketch dates from Haku'un Egyo's lifetime and subse- quently served as model for a number of finished, formal portraits. Medieval portrait painters seem to have used sketches only for the facial features, mostly preferring the three-quarter profile. In this magnifi- cent ink sketch, too, the Zen master has turned his head slightly to the left. With an extremely precise and pointed brush, the anonymous painter first captured the cru- cial parts of the face in delicate ink lines. Then he emphasized details, such as the eyebrows, the chin, and the contour of the head, with a somewhat broader brush and blacker ink, while at the same time chang- ing certain parts of the original sketch. The physiognomy of the bald-pated Zen prelate is characterized by the grave, almost melancholic look in his eyes half covered by the drooping lids and the bushy eyebrows. The protruding cheek bones, the prominent chin, the narrow mouth, and the knotty nose are other striking facial features. Creases between the eyebrows, on the forehead, and on the cheeks further contribute to the care-worn expression of the face. The short hair bristles around the mouth, the chin, and on the side of the cranium are dabbed on the paper with an extremely fine brush. Most striking in the sketch is the contrast between the comparatively precise ren- dering of the face and the loose, light-grey lines of the almost casually drawn shoul- ders. The latter almost seem to be added for the sake of completeness. Haku'un EgyO came from Sanuki in the old province of Mino, present-day Gifu Pre- 246 feature. While he was still a child, his par- ents sent him to Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei to study esoteric Buddhism of the Tendai school. Only sixteen years old, he re- ceived tonsure in 1244. In 1252, he moved to Yamashiro (Kybto) where he entered Senyutji in Higashiyama. Discontent with his religious instruction, he turned to the Zen monastery of Tofukuji in the neigh- bourhood. Here, he found the fulfillment of his spiritual goal under the guidance of Enni Ben'en (1202-1280), and in 1260 he converted to Zen Buddhism. Between 1266 and 1279, Haku'un Egyo spent the decisive years of his career in China, studying under renowned masters, such as Xisou Shaotan (died 1279?) at Ruiyansi in Taizhou and Duanqi Miaoyong (active 1239-after 1269). The latter be- stowed the name Haku'un, "White Cloud", on him. This can be seen in a written document extant at the Tokiwayama Bun- ko, Kamakura, a "confirmation name" cer- tificate by the hand of his spiritual teacher. After the death of Xisou Shaotan, Haku'un Egyo then fifty-one years old, started his journey home in 1279. Soon after his return to Japan, he was selected by Enni Ben'en as his official successor in a ceremonial act, denbb kanjd. In 1292, he was called to Tofukuji as abbot. Shortly afterwards, however, he retired from his official duties to Rikkyoku- an, a cloister he had founded in 1294. There, he died at the age of seventy after a short illness, having written his "depart- ing verse", yuige, on the 25th day of the twelfth month in the fifth year of the Einin era, i.e. January 9, 1298. His mortal re- mains were buried in the tomb pagoda at the north-west corner of Rikkyoku'an. Two years after his death, the Imperial House honoured him with the title "Master of Meditation of the Buddha Light", Busshb Zenji. His most important literary works were compiled by one of his successors, Kyo- shitsu Kihaku, and published in two vol- umes under the title Busshb Zenji goroku. An anthology of his didactic sayings in Japanese, kana hdgo, is entitled Yumei nOki, also known as Yume no ki, "Dream Record".

Ink and colours on silk. 111 x 53 cm. Ganjbji, Tbfukuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 19 and 36. The portrait of Chikotsu Dai'e at Ganjoji of Tbfukuji follows traditional tenets of Zen Buddhist painting for the representation of eminent abbots during their lifetime. It shows the seventy-two year old master in three-quarter profile turned to the right. The inscription runs from right to left. It is dated to the first day of the fifth month of 1301 and states that at that time, Chikotsu Dai'e was abbot of Annydji, a monastery founded by himself in Ise. He is seated in meditation pose with crossed legs on an abbot's seat, kyokuroku, of black wood, with a high back rest, curved legs and arm rests. The chair is covered with a precious, brocaded green textile, happi, with a pattern of overlapping rings and blossoms, and a lighter coloured bor- der with arabesques. Over the plain brown monk's robe, the abbot is wearing a brown stole, kesa, with grey-blue stripes. In his right hand, he holds an admonition staff, kydsaku or keisaku, while the left hand with its strikingly long fingernails lies on the left knee. With great perspicacity, the anonymous artist has captured the full, roundish face of the impressive Zen master. The pene- trating and severe, almost angry look of the prelate makes us feel the presence of the enlightened master. He has a low, receding forehead, white eyebrows, and white hair bristles on the mostly bald cra- nium, around the mouth, and on the cheeks. In this awe-inspiring face, the focal point of this spellbinding portrait, the personality of the energetic, strong-willed master is revealed. The painter has rendered the head with fine lines and light, modelling washes. This subdued, economical treatment of the face is in contrast with the dynamic, pow- erfully flexible brushstrokes delineating the robe. The changing width of the line, the 248 accentuated points marking the onset of the brush, and the abrupt changes of direction in the lines serve to represent bodily volume and folds in the garment and give the painting an almost calli- graphic character. Such affinity with calli- graphic lines was typical of Japanese fig- ure painting of the fourteenth century based on Song painting. Despite the technical dexterity of the artist, the perspectival representation of the chair and the kidney-shaped foot stool, fumidoko, with the shoes, as well as their relationship between each other pre- sented certain difficulties. While the sur- faces of the chair and foot stool appear to be rising upwards at a steep angle, the curved legs of the chair suggest only a slightly rising standing plane. The propor- tions of the body show similar incongru- encies. The lower part of the seated figure is somewhat too small in comparison with the weighty, mighty torso of the corpulent, broad-shouldered master; this gives the impression that the abbot is not actually seated in the chair, but precariously perched on its front edge. The same discrepancies can be seen in the celebrated portrait of Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), dated 1238 and brought back from China to Tofukuji in Kyoto by Enni Ben'en (1202-1280). The painter of Chikotsu Dai'e's portrait must have been familiar with the Wuzhun Shifan likeness. Striking similarities, down to the smallest details, cannot be explained otherwise: the rendering of the capriciously spread fingers of the left hand; the abbot's chair; the fall of the folds in the chair cover and in the garment, especially on the left side, including the unusual calligraphic flour- ishes immediately above the back leg of the chair, are almost identical in the two paintings. Most likely, the Japanese por- traitist took the Song masterwork - accessible in Kyoto from the middle of the thirteenth century at the latest - as model for the overall composition and especially for the rendering of the body, but then concentrated his creative powers on the telling face of his subject. The tension be- tween these two elements makes for the fascination exerted by this early outstand- ing example of Japanese Zen portraiture.

Ink and colours on silk. 125.2 x 51.9 cm. Senbutsuji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, JLjy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 3, 21, 26, and 38. Many literary sources and extant portraits characterize Zhongfeng Mingben as a highly unconventional, original personality. Among Japanese pilgrim monks he was one of the most popular Zen teachers and a number of his portraits made their way to Japan as early as the beginning of the fourteenth century. Thus, the Zen monk Enkei Soyuc (1285-1344) returned to Japan in 1315 from a nine-year stay in China, bringing with him an image of his master signed by the otherwise unknown portraitist Yi'an. In 1325, Enkei built the Kogenji in his native province of Tanba, and the monastery still owns the magnifi- cent portrait of the important Chan mas- ter. The main difference between the early and later portraits of the master is that in the former he is not shown with a shaven head. His dark hair hangs into his fore- head, over the ears, and down his short neck. He seems to have adopted this unconventional and not very clerical hair- cut from his master Gaofeng Yuanmiao (1238-1295). Only from 1318 on, when Zhongfeng Mingben gave up his role as itinerant hermit-monk and accepted the honourable post of a Chan abbot, did he shave his head in accordance with the order's rules. This is how Zhongfeng Mingben is shown in the portrait at Senbutsuji in Kyoto. As it is inscribed by the portrayed abbot, it probably dates to between 1318 and 1323. In its composition with the master turned slightly to the right, the painting is in accordance with the conventional type of Zen portrait painted during the lifetime of the prelate. In such images, the master appears in the dignified regalia of his of- fice, seated in the abbot's chair, yizixiang (Jap. isuz6), "image in the chair". The cor- pulent abbot is seated with crossed legs in meditation pose, his robe falling down over his knees. In front of the chair, his 250 shoes are standing on a footstool with short, ornamented feet. His brown monk's robe hangs loosely around his round shoulders, comfortably open from the chest to his stomach. At the seam of the collar and the sleeves, a white under-gar- ment is visible. A black ring over Ming- ben's heart, fastened with a white cord over the shoulders, holds his stole, kesa. On the left, a long priest's staff, bang (Jap. bo), with red ends leans against the orna- mental cloth covering the back rest of the abbot's chair. In his hands, the abbot holds a whisk, fuzi (Jap. hossu), another symbol of his rank as abbot. Originally, the fly whisk was intended to chase away molesting insects during meditation; meta- phorically, however, it came to signify the sweeping away of all doubts, worldly thoughts, and desires; the symbol for purity of heart, for the removing of "dust from the mirror of the mind", as the patri- archs put it. At his left hand, the mutilated little finger is clearly visible: as young, pas- sionate follower of the Buddhist creed, he had burned it off, to present it as a sacri- fice to Buddha. Zhongfeng Mingben's round, full face with the small, narrow eyes emanates benevolent understanding, his overall posture composed authority. The linear vocabulary of this portrait, typi- cal of one aspect of figure painting during the Yuan Dynasty, is fundamentally differ- ent from the modulated, swelling and ebbing calligraphic line of the Song Dyn- asty. The evenly flowing, thin "iron wire lines", tiexian miao (Jap. tessenbyb), of the garment are partly accompanied by light shadings adding modulation to the folds. The inscription by Zhongfeng Mingben is partly illegible due to fire damage, and it is not to be found in his "Recorded Sayings". The date and the recipient of the portrait are therefore not known. However, some conjectures can be made. Originally, the scroll was at Genjuc'an of Nanzenji in Kyoto, where Mu'in Genkai (before 1310- 1358), a former disciple of the portrayed abbot, was appointed 21 st abbot in 1349. In 1326, three years after the death of his master on Mt. Tianmu near Hangzhou, Mu'in Genkai had returned to Japan, together with a group of monks among whom was Qingzhuo Zhengcheng (1274- 1339). Therefore it is not impossible that Muin Genkai, the future Nanzenji abbot, carried the portrait of Zhongfeng Mingben in his luggage. A document accompanying of the work explains why the scroll had to be newly mounted in 1538: the scroll had been stored in the library of Nanzenji, where there had been a fire shortly before 1538. On the day after the accident, a monk had found the rolled-up scroll in the ashes. Miraculously, only the outer layers of the scroll, i.e., the inscription in the upper, "outer" part, were damaged; the lower, "inner" parts, however, with the actual portrait, were left undamaged.

Inscription by Guangyan (14th century?). Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on silk. 123.5 x 51.2 cm. Jishb'in, Kybto. Cf. Nos. 3, 21, 25, and 38. This portrait of Zhongfeng Mingben is unsigned and without any seals of the artist. It shows the corpulent Chan abbot seated with crossed legs on a rock, the hands in his lap in the "seal of meditation", zenjo'in. Mingben's robe is wide open at the chest, as in other portraits of him. The rock is covered with a precious textile, and his shoes are placed on a smaller rock in front of him. The ground is uneven and partly covered with grass. On the right side, a magnificent pine tree and two bamboo stalks lean over the master like a canopy. It seems as if the Chinese Chan master had selected and prepared an ideal place for meditation in the calm of nature. An inscription in the upper right corner of the scroll probably was added later by an unidentified monk called Guangyan, one of Mingben's numerous disciples: Old Huanweng [Zhongfeng Mingben] here loved pines and bamboo. He received and maintained [Bodhidharma's tradition of] Shaolin[sif. To continue roughly his true school, no matter how far-reaching, His heirs will have to shoulder responsi- bility. [But] who knows [Mingiben Zhongfeng from Tianmu[shan]? His follower Guangyan reverently [wrote] this eulogy. Evidently, this unorthodox open-air por- trait of Zhongfeng Mingben reminded Guangyan of the great founding patriarch Bodhidharma whose celebrated episode of nine-year uninterrupted cliff contempla- tion took place at Shaolinsi. The second line of the poem mentions the monastery on Mt. Song north of Dengfeng in present- day Henan Province, founded in 496 by Emperor Xiaowen (reigned 471 -499) of 252 the Northern Wei Dynasty. A simple shrine, Mianbi'an or "Facing-the-Wall Her- mitage", to the northwest of the monas- tery preserves the memory of the origin of Chan Buddhism in China. The discrepancy in style between the fig- ure and the landscape seems to indicate that two painters collaborated on the composition. While the rocks and grasses, the pine and the bamboo are painted with vigour and fantasy, the somewhat stiff fig- ure - rendered with even "iron wire lines", tiexian miao (Jap. tessenbyb) - is painted in slavish adherence to the preliminary drawing that is partially visible. Such joint works, hezuo, were quite com- mon among literati circles of the Yuan Dynasty. The pine tree and the bamboo in this portrait bear a striking resemblance to the style of Li Shixing (1283-1328) and, even more so, of his father, Li Kan (1245- 1320). The latter was greatly admired by Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) as is vouched for by his colophons and eulogies on Li's bamboo paintings. On the other hand, Zhao was a close friend of Zhongfeng Mingben, as witnessed by six extant let- ters of Zhao to Mingben dating to ca. 131 1. Moreover, there exists in Taipei a copy by the Qing Dynasty painter Pan Gongshou (1741-1794) of a painting showing Ming- ben as portrayed by Zhao Mengfu in 1309. Most likely, this was not the only likeness Zhao made of his abbot friend. It is thus not far-fetched to suggest that such a work or a sketch by Zhao Mengfu might have served as the model for the portrait at Jishb'in. The anonymous artist might have faithfully copied his model, meticu- lously clinging to every line. To some degree this would also explain the stiff- ness of the brushwork. If one is to accept the collaboration of two artists and perhaps even the active partic- ipation of Zhao Mengfu and Li Kan, or members of their circle, several questions remain unanswered. Since Zhongfeng Mingben survived both artists by a few years, the painting must have been done during his lifetime. In that case, however, the sitter should - according to orthodox rules of Chan portraiture - look toward the right. But this highly unconventional Ming- ben portrait was probably not intended to be presented to a disciple confirming his advanced stage of spiritual perception or his legitimate place in the master's line of succession. It was perhaps simply done to demonstrate the Chan abbot's love for nature. Mingben preferred to lead the life of a religious recluse among bamboo, rocks, and old trees, unhampered by the organized hierarchy of his school in major busy meditation centres. The portrait may have been done for the abbot's or the painters' own amusement. One may see it as an enchanting, complex mirror image of the character of an unconventional her- mit monk, maybe even as a token of close friendship between congenial personali- ties of the Yuan Dynasty.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 35.5 x 41.8 cm. Tbfukuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOyb Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 28 and 52. Enni Ben'en, who is better known by his posthumous title Shbichi Kokushi, "National Master of the Holy Oneness", bestowed on him by Emperor Hanazono (reigned 1308-1318), was one of the out- standing figures of early Zen in Japan. At the early age of four, he is said to have entered the Buddhist monastery on Kunbzan in his native province Suruga, present-day Shizuoka Prefecture. At sev- enteen, he received tonsure at Onjoji, one of the leading Tendai centers, and shortly afterwards was ordained as a monk at Tbdaiji in Nara. In the following year, he went to Kyoto to study Confucianism. Soon, however, he moved to Kamakura in order to deepen his Buddhist studies with the great masters there. In 1235, at thirty-three, he travelled to China where he devoted himself com- pletely to Zen. After short stays with Chijue Daochong (1170-1251) and Shitian Faxun (1171 -1245), Enni Ben'en went on to the famous Jingshan abbot Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), who was deeply im- pressed by the religious fervor and the learning of the young Japanese pilgrim monk. After only two years of study, Enni Ben'en received the confirmation certifi- cate, inkajd, from his master in 1237; one year later, the Chinese Chan prelate dedi- cated an official portrait, chinzd, to his Ja- panese disciple. In 1241, Enni Ben'en brought both of these works back to Japan with him. They are still extant at Tofukuji, where they are revered as docu- ments of eminent religious and artistic sig- nificance. After a short sojourn at Hakata, Enni Ben'en was appointed the founding abbot of Tbfukuji in Kybto in 1255. Shortly before his appointment, he lost his right eye at the age of fifty-two. In 1280, on the 17th day of the tenth month, he died at the high age of seventy-eight. 254 The small ink painting at Tbfukuji depicts Enni Ben'en seated on a rock at the side of a mountain slope inclining toward the left. He sits with loosely stretched legs in the shadow of a tree branch, his left elbow resting on the rock. In this informal pos- ture and environment, the portrayed mas- ter seems to have come back to life, as if the artist had seen him in the garden of his monastery and went on to portray him thus. The artist, however, had probably never seen his model face to face: by tra- dition, the work is attributed convincingly to Kichizan Mincho (1351 -1431), the highly gifted and prolific painter-monk active at Tofukuji from about 1380 onwards. For his work, however, Mincho could rely on the abundant art treasures of his monastery, as well as on other magnif- icent painting collections in Kyoto. Thus, official chinzd signed by Minchb indicate that he was familiar with Enni Ben'en's appearance. According to an old anec- dote, the 28th abbot of Tofukuji, Daidb Ichi'i (1292-1370), threatened to sever his master-disciple relationship with Minchb because the young novice devoted him- self almost exclusively to the study of the arts, especially painting, while neglecting his actual religious tasks and the Zen Buddhist exercises. Under this threat, Minchb is said to have felt like a dis- carded, useless, "torn straw sandal", hasdai. In the end, the rift seems to have been mended, and Daidb Ichi'i turned to his gifted pupil with more understanding. Mincho, however, chose the word Hasdai as one of his artist's names seen in his seals. The open-air portrait is the least conven- tional form of Zen Buddhist portraiture. Apart from secular paintings of poets and scholars in landscapes, especially Arhat images as well as individual biographical episodes, seem to have stimulated por- traits of Zen masters in landscape set- tings. This was an opportunity for the artists to free themselves from the strictly formalized, official portrait scheme and develop their own ideas. This approach to the subject seems to have appealed to the artist of the Enni Ben'en painting, too. The wrinkled face of the one-eyed old master is painted with a pointed brush. The folds of the garments are rendered with more vigorous, swelling and ebbing ink lines. Delicate grey washes and short, darker texture lines characterize the surface of the rocky ground. From the upper edge of the composition, the branch of a conifer protrudes into the painting, acting as a counterpoint to the central figure and the outline of the slope running diagonally from the upper right to the lower left. Even though the attractive ink painting bears neither signature nor seal, it can be easily fitted into Minchb's oeuvre. In its flexible, energetic brushwork, it is closely related with the Byaku'e Kannon image at the Nara National Museum, as well as with the portrait of Shun'oku Mybha (1311 -1388) at Kogen'in, Kybto (Fig. 71). This scroll was eventually taken to China, where the ab- bot of Jingcisi, Zufang Daolian, added a eulogy dated 1404. It is dedicated to one of Mybha's disciples named Shozen, who studied in China at that time. The outdoor portrait of Daido Ichi'i (1292-1370) on a rocky plateau under a pine tree, accom- panied by a deer and a goose, at the Nara National Museum, traditionally attributed to Minchb, also shows a thematic as well as stylistic affinity with the Enni Ben'en portrait. Shbkai Reiken (1315-1396), a suc- cessor of Daidb Ichi'i, inscribed the por- trait in 1394.

First half 15th century. Hanging scroll. Ink and colours on silk. 85.7 x 37.5 cm. Tbfukuji, Kybto. In western art history, the term "triple por- trait" usually refers to three views of the same person, two profile views from right and left, and one frontal view. Therefore, it might not be entirely appropriate to trans- late the Japanese term for a painting showing three patriarchs, sansozd, with "triple portrait". Although Zen art was always open to experimentation, this type of portrait remained isolated. Among the few extant examples is the scroll owned by ShOfukuji at Fukuoka showing the long haired Chan master Gaofeng Yuanmiao (1239-1295) and his two disciples, Zhongfeng Mingben (1263-1323) and Duanya Liaoyi (1263-1334). The inscrip- tion of the painting, added by Mu'an Wenkang around 1460, states that the three portrayed masters, like fathers and sons, will always transmit the spirit of Zen of the "Lion's Rock", Shiziyan, on Mt. Tian- mu. It is therefore a generational portrait, depicting the ancestor on the central axis on a special, heightened chair in the back, and his two successors at his feet to the right and the left, seated in common abbot's chairs and turned toward each other. A similar genealogical image of three Japanese Zen masters has been preserved in a portrait scroll at the Masaki Bijutsukan. It represents Muso Soseki (1275-1351) elevated in his abbot's chair and flanked by his followers Mokuo Myokai (1311-1384) and Daigaku Shusut (1345-1423) in half-figure portraits at his feet rising above mystic clouds. The latter also provided the inscription. The three renowned abbots of TOfukuji also appear in hierarchical order. The anonymous artist of this scroll, however, preferred the half-torso portrait, placing his three plain-robed monks in a circle. Like the Yuan artist and the painter of the Masaki scroll, he did not render the cen- tral figure in frontal view, although that 256 would have seemed to be the most logical choice. Only in rare exceptions did Zen Buddhist portrait painting abandon the three-quarter profile. Flanked by ZOzan Junkut on his left and Daido Ichi'i on his right, Enni Ben'en, the one-eyed founder abbot of Tofukuji, stands slightly raised in the back. Enni Ben'en was the teacher of ZOzan Junku, and the latter instructed Daido Ichi'i; thus the portrait also indicates a generational sequence. The triumvirate is introduced to the viewer by title inscriptions at the top, worded and placed in accordance with rank and age: Shdichi Kokushi, "National Master of the Holy Oneness", in the cen- ter; Enkan Zenji, "Zen Master of the Round Mirror", on the right; and Daido Osho, "Reverend of the Great Way". The enig- matic name Enni Ben'en is reminiscent of an unsolvable, paradoxical meditation task; translated literally, it means "The Differentiating Round of the Encircled You". Zozan Junk-u's posthumously given honorary title also refers to the roundness of the mirror, most likely because Zozan was considered to be the "embodiment of calm and enlightenment", jakushb, and an incarnation of Enzut Daishi, the "Great Master of Circular Penetration", the Bodhisattva Kannon. It is quite possible that the anonymous painter, active in the first half of the fif- teenth century and perhaps a monk in the Tofukuji atelier, was guided in his choice of format for the painting by the Buddhist ideas encoded in the names and titles of the portrayed prelates. For the even grey of the circle in reserve on the silk ground makes the three Zen masters appear as if surrounded by a halo, and at the same time as if they were reflected in a round mirror. Enso, the circle, a shape without beginning or end, and thus of all-encom- passing perfection, had been considered for centuries in Zen as a manifestation of the Buddha wisdom springing from the absolute essence of nature, pervading and penetrating everything, transcending all opposites and emptying them to absolute unity. It symbolizes the innermost ground of all living beings, devoid of colour and shape, the "original counte- nance before birth", since the primal "round knowledge", engaku, of the Buddha is latent in all creatures. The popular metaphor of the "Great Round Mirror", dai'enkyb, may be applied to this portrait scroll, too, expressing the universal unity eliminating all particulars and levels of Zen knowledge. The name of Engakuji, the "Monastery of the Round Knowledge", one of the most important medieval Zen centres of Japan in Kamakura, must also be based, at least in part, on such reli- gious-philosophical concepts.

Inscription by Muso Soseki, ca.1349/1350. Hanging scroll. Ink and colours on silk. 119.4 x 63.9 cm. Myochi'in, Tenryuji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, Juyo Bunkazai. Cf. No 40. The distinguished Zen prelate Muso Soseki is depicted here in a half-figure portrait which he inscribed probably a few years before his death. Half-figure por- traits, hanshinzi, painted during the life- time of the subject are relatively rare. Medieval Japanese Zen artists reserved the half-length format rather for the depic- tion of patriarchs and founder figures in ideal portraits long after the death of the subject. Often, such portraits were grouped together in voluminous sets. The painting of Muso Soseki at Mybchi'in of Tenryiji is the only extant painting by the highly gifted painter-monk Muto Shii, a pupil of the portrayed Zen master. His signature along the lower right edge reads: "By the brush of Muto Shii". Re- liable sources tell us that he painted his master several times. The Mukyoku Oshc den cites the colophon by Muso Soseki on such a portrait by Muto Shui which the second Tenryiji abbot Mukyoku Shigen (1282-1359) had commissioned in 1349, at a time when his teacher and predeces- sor was living at Saihbji. According to the TenryG Kaisan Kokushi shinsoki by Chuhb Eni (1354-1413), Muto Shii had already painted a portrait of his master in 1341, also bearing a dated inscription by Muso Soseki. This portrait was owned by the Muso disciple Kyib Fukan (1322-1410). From other early sources we know of wall painting cycles which Muto Shii painted for monasteries in Kybto. He seems to have been one of the first Zen Buddhist painter-monks who could sustain com- plex atelier activities beside his clerical duties. Unusual for a Zen portrait, painted after the living model around 1349/50, is that Muso Soseki in three-quarter profile looks toward the left, so that his five-line colo- phon, adjusted against the direction of his 258 eyes, runs from left to right. The inscrip- tion reads: The lower parts [of the body from hips] to heels cannot expound a theme. Thus, there appears in the "Gate of Erection and Change" kenkemon, [only the upper] half of the body, hanshin. Muso Soseki accuses himself. Kenkemon is the gate to Zen accessible by provisional methods and instruction. They are tentative, sometimes unconven- tional ways to guide unenlightened peo- ple, to "erect" and to "change" them. The colophon sounds almost like an apology for the fact that the portrait is not a con- ventional full-figure one; and that artist and model preferred a half-figure portrait which concentrates on the essential, the facial features, while less important parts, such as richly decorated robes, were omitted. Indeed, Muto Shui succeeded in captur- ing the tolerant character and the pro- gressive spiritual attitude in the solemn face of his illustrious master. This impress- ive rendering is testament to the artist's intense relationship with his model, his sensitive perceptive grasp, and his talent for conveying to the viewer the individual- ity of the portrayed master by an interpre- tative counterfeit. Sparse, fine lines and delicate colours indicate the essential details. A few ink lines describe the fall of the steel-grey monk's robe. The seams of the broad, rust-red strips of the kesa are contrasted from the brown ground of the stole by light washes. Such extremely economical means give the figure volume and convincingly render the textiles' spe- cific surface quality. The sophisticated combination of subdued colours and few, rhythmically coordinated lines show Muto Shci's artistic genius. In its unobtrusive overall effect, the work represents the general style of Zen Buddhist portraiture in Japan around the middle of the fourteenth century, as it developed on the basis of Song painting.

Inscription by IkkyO Sbjun; datable to 1471. Hanging scroll. Ink and colours on paper. 81.6 x 34.5 cm. Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, Osaka. Cf. Nos. 31, 42, and 46. Ikkyi Sbjun was an extremely eccentric personality, full of spiritual as well as phys- ical passion. There are innumerable anec- dotes and legends concerning Ikkyut that inspired painters to ever new representa- tions of the idiosyncratic Zen master, dur- ing his lifetime as well as long after his death. Although the official biography does not mention it, other sources tell us that when he was already above seventy, the vigorous Zen master fell desperately in love with a blind singer called Mori (also read Shin), who, although considerably younger than him, died several years before Ikky0. A series of erotic poems he dedicated to her has come down to us in the Kybunshu, "Crazy Cloud Anthology". The double portrait showing lkkyu and Mori also tells of their love relationship. Ikkyu, presumably seventy-seven years old, is shown in a circle as a half-figure, three-quarter profile view looking to the right. Below him, his somewhat stout paramour kneels on a mat with colourfully decorated borders. She is depicted con- siderably smaller than Ikkyu-, looking to the left in three-quarter profile. In front of her lies a hand drum, kodo, and beside her a blind person's staff. Above the circle and below it, the rest of the scroll is filled with two poetic inscriptions: the upper one in Chinese, by Ikkyu-, and the lower one in cursive Japanese syllabary by Mori: Within the "Great Circle" dai'enso, appears the entire body. This painting expresses the true features of Xutang [Zhiyu, 1185-1269]. The love song of the blind woman derides the girls in their pavilions. One song in front of this flower [brings] ten thousand years of spring. Formerly at Daitoku~li], the "old cassock"' rono, from the Eastern Sea [So]jun fkkyu in the seventh generation of Tianze 260 [Xutang Zhiyu] dedicated this self-eulogy to the layman Tamagaki. The short poem by Mori, introduced on the right edge as a "poem by Mori Shoro", reads: Sleep of yearning, Sleep of worries, in bed, Floating and sinking, But for tears, There is no consolation. The recipient of this double portrait, who may also have commissioned it, was Tamagaki Koji with the Zen Buddhist name Soshin Sho'etsu (1441 -1519), a follower of Ikkyo's. As the scroll bears neither sig- nature nor seal, the artist's identity can only be surmised. Given the very personal subject, however, it is reasonable to assume that the painter was close to both Ikkyut and Soshin. In this respect, the most likely candidate is the painter-monk Boku- sai, an elder confrere of Soshin Sho'etsu who was abbot of Shuton'an and Shinju'an two and three generations before him, respectively. A devoted disciple, Bokusai had accompanied Ikkyu ever since 1452. He became his successor as head of Shuton'an in Takigi, wrote his biography, and portrayed him in the famous half-fig- ure sketch at the TokyO National Museum. The fine line drawing in the face of the grave-looking abbot corresponds closely to that sketch - evidently approved by the sitter -, except for the direction of lkkyu's eyes and the bristly hair. The creases and wrinkles which characterize the old face are identical almost line by line, although drawn somewhat more carefully in the double portrait than in the sketch. The colour scheme of the double portrait, such as the pale-reddish flesh tones, the red of the lips, the light brown of the robe, the emerald green of the kesa and the mat, as well as the intense cinnabar red of Mori's upper garment, matches that of the half- figure portrait sketch as well as that of an official chinzb of Ikkyt at Shton'an (Fig. 115). The latter also seems to have been painted after the famous sketch, and it seems safe to add the Shuton'an portrait to Bokusai's oeuvre as well. The technical treatment of the background, too, is the same in the sketch and in the Masaki scroll: an even, gray wash vividly accentu- ates the portrayed figure in reserve. The scroll shows marked differences not only in the format of the two portraits, but also in the stylistic treatment of the two figures. The blind woman is seated on a mat raised at an angle, agedatami, which runs horizontally across the full width of the scroll. The roundish, feminine face, heavily made up with white powder, is indicated rather summarily. A few lines characterize the mouth, nose, and eyes of the blind woman singer with the black hairknot. The face is clearly reminiscent of the old, conventional technique of hikime kagihana, which reduces facial features to "a stroke for the eye and a hook for the nose'. The Mori portrait has nothing of the acutely observing realism so highly char- acteristic of the half-figure Ikkyut portrait. To these differences are added the dis- crepancy in the lines of the garments. The briskly dynamic brushwork of Mori's kimono is related to the line vocabulary of the Tosa school, which used the tech- niques and themes of old yamato'e. But ultimately, it is the tradition of kasen'e, ideal portraits of famous Japanese waka poetesses and poets, that stands behind the Mori portrait.

Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 43.3 x 26 cm. Tokyo National Museum. Important Cultural Property, Juyd Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 30, 42, and 46. The Zen monk Bokusai painted a number of portraits depicting his master Ikkyui Sojun. For this purpose, he probably made a carefully elaborated draft ap- proved by Ikkyui. Bokusai came from the monastic community of Tenryuiji in Kyoto and became a disciple of the intractable Ikkyui in 1452. His new master bestowed the Buddhist name of Motsurin Joto on him. Later he was appointed the second abbot, and thus the direct successor of his famous teacher, of Shuion'an in Takigi near the capital. It was Bokusai who wrote the biography of Ikkyu-, the Ikkyu Oshd nenpu. In 1491, one year before his death, Bokusai started the construction work of Shinju'an, a cloister on the precincts of Daitokuji, to be erected in memory of the tenth anniversary of Ikkyu-'s death. To hon- our his teacher further, he had the Katsuro'an, destroyed in 1467 by a fire, reconstructed in the same year. The painter-monk Bokusai did not focus exclusively on figures and portraits. His interest turned also to landscapes and fruits as well as to the art of writing. A loosely brushed painting of a grapevine, a stylistically closely related scroll of a melon, and two mountain landscapes in "splashed ink" technique, hatsuboku, at Shinju'an and at the Masaki Museum, Tadaoka, are testament to his interest in this "impressionistic" style of eccentrics and Zen monks. All four works of the artist mentioned bear colophons by Bokusai himself. On the half-figure Ikkyui portrait study at the Tokyo National Museum, Bokusai stamped his seal - in the shape of an archaic Chinese bronze tripod - at the end of the inscription. IkkyO's self-eulogy is written in the style of the portrayed master on a separate sheet of paper which was then joined to the sketch. The text can be 262 found, with slight variations, written by Ikkyui on other portraits of him. Bokusai shows the "former" 47th abbot of Daitokuji in three-quarter profile turned to the right. He indicates the shoulders only with a few terse strokes. The face, how- ever, is carefully delineated in a fine, detailed drawing. The portrait is clearly brought into relief against the even grey wash of the background. Closer scrutiny of the original shows that the painter first drew the lines of the face and the contours with pale ink and a fine brush. Especially around the eyes, he re- touched several unsatisfactory lines. In the end, light colours were added, and the delicate lines of the face were re-drawn with an intensifying rust-red. This tech- nique was customary in medieval East Asian painting, and can be seen in other Zen portraits and Buddhist figure paint- ings. One wonders which of the many extant portraits of Ikkyu- Sojun were painted after this sketch. Shion'an south of Kyoto, where lkkyui found his last resting place and where Bokusai resided as second abbot, owns a full figure portrait of IkkyO (Fig. 115). This scroll is very close to Bokusai's half-figure sketch in its overall style as well as in details of the line treat- ment. Moreover, the colophons, except for a few minor name changes, are the same on both paintings. However, the most striking resemblance in the two works is the penetrating facial expression of the portrayed master, his critically searching, even challenging look peering from the corners of his eyes. It is this look, not seen on any other Ikkyu- por- traits, and generally unusual in Zen por- traiture, that vividly intensifies the immedi- ate communication between the por- trayed master and the viewer.

Patterned silk. 119.5 x 254 cm. Rikkyoku'an, Tofukuji, Kyoto. Cf. Nos. 2 and 23. The Chinese term zhizhui (Jap. jikitotsu) may be translated as "sewn together straight". The name can be explained by the fact that this garment - belonging to the "liturgical attire", ho'e, of a Buddhist monk - originally consisted of an upper part, hensan, and a lower part, kunsu. The latter covered the body from the hips on down and is thought to have been origi- nally worn as a night gown. Since the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), monks and nuns of Zen monasteries preferably used this type of robe. In Japan, the jikitotsu came to be popular especially with the followers of the Rinzai school. Haku'un Egyo studied in China from 1266 until 1279. In 1292, he was appointed fourth abbot of Tbfukuji. Two years later, in 1294, he retired to Rikkyoku'an, where he died after a short illness in 1298 at the age of seventy years. This jikitotsu, kept at Rikkyoku'an with other garments that belonged to Haku'un Egyo, is sewn together of seven different kinds of material in pieces of varying size. The dark blue pieces of the patchwork- like robe can be described as follows: 1. Silk gauze, kenmonsha, with a bro- caded pattern of blossoming branches, ori'edabana mon, joined together into quadruple "sceptre heads", nyo'iga- shira. 2. Silk gauze with brocaded pattern of blossoming single branches, ori'eda- bana mon. 3. A type of silk called komesha with quadruple "scepter heads", nyo'iga- shira and blossoming single branches, oriedabana mon. 266 4. Loosely woven gauze, ukimonsha, with a pattern of peony arabesques, botan karakusa mon. 5. A more densely woven material, kata- ji'aya, with a rhombus-shaped pattern of stylized blossoms, saiwaibishi mon. 6. A more densely woven material, kata- ji'aya, with a tripartite rhomboid pat- tern, mi'edasuki mon. 7. A more densely woven material, kata- ji'aya, with a lattice pattern, kbshi mon. These seven types of material can be divided into two groups: the first four have several qualities in common, and the last three are all woven rather densely. The first three silks have a pattern of blossoming branches. This kind of material can some- times be seen on portraits, chinzo, of the Kamakura period and the Nanbokucho painted during the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, in which the portrayed masters wear stoles, kesa, and jikitotsu with com- parable patterns. Fragments of similar materials have also been found in a Southern Song tomb of the Zhou family in De'an, Jiangxi Province. On the basis of that find, it is thought that the pieces of the materials 1 to 4 of Haku'un Egyo's jikitotsu are of Chinese origin, dating to the twelfth or thirteenth century. The textiles of the second group, however, represent a quite different type of weave. They are embellished with rhombus and lattice patterns, and belong to a type of textile called yushoku orimono, tradition- ally woven in Japan for use in aristocratic circles. These Japanese parts of the gar- ment may well have been added after Haku'un Egyo's death, while he may have brought the Chinese parts with him from China in 1279. Perhaps they were frag- ments of a robe already worn by one of his Chinese teachers. Thus, at least the orig- inal parts of the jikitotsu worn by Haku'un Egyb can be dated to the time between 1279 and 1298.

Patterned silk. 121.5 x 189 cm. Chbtoku'in, Shbkokuji, Kybto. Cf. Nos. 22, 41, and 45. A kasciya or kesa in Japanese is a rectan- gular priest's stole sewn together of vari- ous pieces of material in patchwork fash- ion according to type. It is put on in accordance with ritual rules, and usually fastened with a cord and a ring, kan, on the left side of the chest. According to tra- dition, the kesa at Chbtoku'in of Shbkokuji once belonged to Zekkai Chushin, the sixth abbot of this important gozan monastery in Kybto. Consisting of twenty- five pieces of outstanding quality, nij]go- jogesa, it is considered an especially valu- able piece. The rectangular central fields, denscbu, are made of red silk, donsu, with a pattern of auspicious Buddhist symbols and "floating clouds", hiun. The somewhat nar- rower red silk strips in between, teiyo or joyO, are embellished with lotus arab- esques, renge karakusa mon, and the "eight Buddhist treasure emblems", happo. The border, en, shows a similar pattern, but is made of gold brocade, kinran. All four corners, the "four heavens", shiten, are adorned with a square piece of another gold brocade textile showing a blossom, hosoge, rising from a stylized wave pattern. All Buddhist symbols shown on the kesa are auspicious. Thus the lotus blossom signifies purity, uprightness in adverse cir- cumstances, and creative power. The pair of fish promise double gain, fertility, and protection against evil. The treasure bowl means eternal harmony and - as reliquary - triumph over life and death. The endless knot symbolizes giving and taking in abun- dance and the entrails of Buddha. The conch shell, which also served as wind- instrument, signals Buddha's voice. The flame-engulfed wheel of the law repre- sents the irresistible spread of Buddha's teaching. The honorary parasol indicates 268 L ~ ~ S. kl ~ - ' ? &gt;?-K 4&gt;f B 4rR spiritual authority and respect, while the canopy stands for royal dignity. The bro- caded patterns are arranged in accor- dance with the size of the fields. When the kesa is worn, none of the patterns is the wrong side up or lying on the side. Thus, the kesa was carefully and meticulously planned, from the selection of the textiles to the sewing together of the different pieces. Zekkai Chishin, who held the eminently important office of soroku, "Registrar General of Monks", and thus resided at Rokuon'in on the precincts of Shbkokuji, is considered one of the most important literati monks, bunjinso, of his time, with decisive and lasting influence on the "liter- ature of the five mountains", gozan bun- gaku. In 1368 he set out to China, where he remained several years for his studies. The learned monk was well received, and came even to the attention of the Imperial court. It is thus not unreasonable to sur- mise that he may have received this stole from one of his Chinese teachers, perhaps as a farewell gift. Whatever its origin, the nijygojogesa of Chbtoku'in is a magnifi- cent work of early Ming textile craft, out- standing in its quality and artistic creativ- ity. Precious import textiles such as this kesa are known in Japan under the term meibutsu gire, "celebrated fabrics". S.K.</page><page sequence="262">34 Ming Dynasty Monk's Stole, kasjya, Made of Nine Parts Kujdgesa Worn by Fusen Hojo (1313-1383), 14th century. Patterned silk. 130.5 x 374 cm. Sanshi'in, Tenryuji, Kyoto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. According to Tenryiji tradition, this "nine- part kesa", kujfgesa, was worn by Fusen Hojo. He came to the metropolitan monastery as a young man between 1345 and 1349, learning to "hold the whisk", hinpotsu, from Muso Soseki, i.e., he passed the access examination. In the eighth month of 1378, Fusen Hojo became the 16th abbot of his monastery, and one year before his death, at the age of sixty- nine, he was appointed the 42nd abbot of Nanzenji. He was among the renowned Zen masters of Kybto, and even the young Shbgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) is said to have asked him for instruction in Zen meditation. If the monastery's tradi- tion is true, Fusen Hojo's year of death, 1383, provides a terminus ante quem for the sewing of the kujogesa. Since Hojo does not seem to have travelled to China, another pilgrim monk may have brought back the stole - or at least the material for it - from Yuan or early Ming China. The rectangular areas, densobu, of the kesa consist of brownish silk, aya, with a pattern of tripartite rhombi, mi'edasuki, swastika, manji, and plum blossom branches, ume'eda. The somewhat nar- rower strips, teiyo, between the rectangu- lar areas are made of gold brocade on a light ground, shiroji no kinran, embellished with a main motif of luxuriant peony blos- soms in double arabesques, futa'ezuru botan mon. However, not all of the strips of the brocade motif are of the same size, i.e., two kinds of brocaded materials were used for the stole. Both kinds, however, use gold thread not only for the decorative pattern, but also for the background, a technique that is called kanaji kinran, "bro- cade on gold ground". The kanaji kinran parts in Fusen Hojo's stole belong to the oldest examples extant of this precious Chinese textile type.

Model for the name plaque of a monastery building. Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 45.5 x 103 cm. Tofukuji, Kyoto. National Treasure, Kokuho. Writings from the brush of important Zen masters are called "ink traces", moji or bokuseki. As a rule, they are read from right to left. The two characters on this scroll, fangzhang in Chinese, hojo in Japanese, are an abbreviation of the term yizhang sifang, "one zhang of four squares, fang", a surface area that corre- sponds to about ten square feet. The expression originally applied to the mod- est hermitage of the wise Buddhist layman Vimalakirti, but since Tang times refers to the abbot's residence as well as to the prelate himself. The two powerful characters are brought to paper with a broad brush. They were the model for large name plaques to be hung over the entrance of an abbot's res- idence, announcing the office and rank of the occupant. Such carved wooden tablets with "frontal characters", gakuji, were designed to be clearly seen from a great distance. Two wooden plaques showing the two characters of the present scroll can still be seen above the Abbot's Quarters of Tbfukuji and Kenninji in Kybto. The scroll is neither signed nor sealed. But the bold, vigorous brushwork leaves no doubt that this is a masterwork by the cel- ebrated Song official Zhang Jizhi (Jap. Cho Sokushi, 1186-1266), whose ener- getic writing style was greatly admired by Japanese pilgrim monks. Zhang was in close contact with the Buddhist clergy of his time, and unquestionably knew the illustrious Chan master Wuzhun Shifan (1177-1249), the abbot of the renowned monastery on Jingshan and other impor- tant meditation centres. A number of outstanding works of writing show similar large characters; they are extant at Tbfukuji in Kybto. These works were sent originally by Wuzhun Shifan to 272 his former disciple Enni Ben'en (Shbichi Kokushi, 1202-1280), who had studied with the Chinese master for almost seven years from 1235 until 1241. Enni Ben'en was a fervent adept of continental Chan culture and art. Upon his return from China, he founded a monastery at Hakata, the Jbtenji. The written masterworks were intended to serve as models for carved wooden tablets at this new Japanese Zen institution. When Enni Ben'en was ap- pointed "mountain opener" or founder abbot of Tbfukuji in 1255 and moved to Kybto, he took along the precious writings he had received from his Chinese master. Although the two magnificent characters fangzhang are not written by a Zen mas- ter, but a court official, they nevertheless belong among the most outstanding "ink traces" of Zen art extant. Majestic and momentous, clearly legible, and written with a strong hand in "regular script", kaisho, the work emanates vigorous energy and decisiveness. Between the two characters can be seen the rectangu- lar property seal of Fumon'in, a cloister erected in 1246 in the northern part of the Tbfukuji precinct. After his move from Hakata to Kybto, Enni Ben'en resided there temporarily. E.A.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 39.3 x 56.7 cm. Ganjbji, Tbfukuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 19 and 24. Eminent Zen masters often wrote a few lines or a complete poem in their last moments of life, in order to leave their dis- ciples a last testament of their enlightened spirit or a summary of their teachings and lifelong experience. Such poems or gathjs are called yuige, "departing verses". Al- ready marked by death, the ninth abbot of Tbfukuji, Chikotsu Dai'e, wrote his spiri- tual legacy and admonition to his followers on the 22nd day of the eleventh month in the first year of the era Shdwa, 1312, at the age of eighty-three (according to Western calculation). He speaks of the means to be used for salvation, hdben, of the inner self-realization of truth, jishd, and the natural spontaneity in response to the demands and tasks in this world, jinen. The short stanza, running from right to left, consists of four lines of four characters each. However, the characters are un- evenly distributed: there are three in the first line, five in the second, and four char- acters each in the third and fourth line. On the lower left, there is the signature Dai'e, followed by his paraph, ka'c. The date is given along the left edge. The arrange- ment and brushwork of the characters are somewhat confused. The lines are waver- ing, and only a few characters show any relation with the conventional rules and structure of Chinese writing. But it is precisely this waning of the mas- ter's command over his handwriting that shows dramatically the extreme situation of the dying man. With a heroic effort, he tries to mobilize his last forces. Thus, this work must not be judged according to the usual criteria and aesthetic requirements of calligraphy; rather, it must be seen as a moving human and religious document of a master who was extremely vigorous and energetic during his lifetime. Up to his last moment, he endeavoured to fulfill his duty 274 in unison with the tradition of his school, after a long life fully devoted to the goal of enlightenment. The yuige of Chikotsu Dai'e is considered a representative example of this special type of Zen Buddhist "ink traces". It is deeply revered as outstanding religious testament full of human closeness and immediacy. Ganjoji of Tofukuji in Kyoto, where this moving bokuseki scroll is extant, also has a portrait painting of Chikotsu Dai'e with a self-eulogy dated 1301, giving us a vivid impression of the master's strong personality.

Issan Ichinei, 1247-1317), dated 1316. Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 89.4 x 30.3 cm. Kenninji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 8 and 20. Setsuya no saku, "Composed on a Snowy Night", is a Chinese quatrain that Yishan Yining wrote at the age of sixty-nine. The poem is composed in the classical meter of seven words per line, a so-called qiyan jueju (Jap. shichigon zekku), "regulated seven-character stanza". At the beginning of his verse, the poet muses about rever- ent patriarchs of old times, while outside the snowstorm lashes against his window. In the second part, Yishan Yining, who had come to Japan in 1299 under un- happy circumstances, expresses his per- sonal sentiments of the moment: In the cold, small room, my loins are dis- content while fasting; On Mt. Ao, frozen in frost, the wandering paths can hardly be made out. All night long, the window rattles and makes an unpleasant noise; And since there are matters that haunt me, I did not find clarity for a long time. Composed on a snowy night in the twelfth month of the fourth year in the Shbwa [era] by Yishan, the "old cassock" Yining. In the first line, the poet relates his own frosty situation to the second Chinese Chan patriarch Huike (487-593). At the age of forty, Huike is said to have remained up to his hips in the snow on Mt. Song, patiently waiting to be accepted as disciple by Bodhidharma, who was him- self seated in a nine-year uninterrupted meditation in front of a cliff at Shaolin Monastery. The second line alludes to an episode in which Xuefeng Yicun (822- 908) was snowed in on Mt. Ao and sud- denly attained enlightenment upon a word by his companion Yantou Quanhuo (828- 887). The two last lines of the poem describe how the snowy wind of the winter's night 276 rattles at the window of the poet's her- mitage, and how Yishan Yining ponders melancholically his situation in the dark- ness of the night, probably especially his teaching activities in Japan and his life in a foreign land. At the end, on the left edge of the scroll, he indicates the date of these "ink traces": the twelfth month of the fourth year of the era Shdwa. The Western equivalent of the last lunar month, rbgetsu, of this year is the very beginning of 1316. Although the scroll is only a small, cursory work, it has been traditionally considered as an outstanding example of the abbrevi- ating, dynamic "cursive script", sbsho, from the brush of the great Zen master and gozan poet Yishan Yining.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 29.4 x 38.8 cm. Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo. Cf. Nos. 3, 21, 25, and 26. This gathj is a quatrain with five charac- ters in each line, a poetic form that is called wuyan jueju in Chinese, and gogon zekku in Japanese. The revered master of meditation Zhongfeng Mingben wrote it for a certain Shanyan or Zengen. The first character of that name means "good, benevolent, virtuous" and the second strictc, severe, dignified"; the name can thus be translated as "benevolent strict- ness". In the poem, the author plays on the two characters of the name, weaving them into the first line and morally encour- aging the recipient of the name: If your benevolent spirit remains in place firm and pure; If you have strength on the way, are skill- ful and diligent in time; Then you do not have to think up artificial means, Because a spirit of natural spontaneity, ziran, does not stray. The Oldster of the Huan[zhu'an] wrote this, As explanation of [the name] Shanyan. As the eulogy indicates, the poem is a commentary on the confirmation name for a disciple of Zhongfeng Mingben. We do not know if this Shanyan was Chinese or Japanese. If the recipient was one of the numerous Japanese visiting disciples of Zhongfeng Mingben, the name has to be read Zengen. In keeping with his eccentric character, Zhongfeng Mingben had an extremely individual style of writing. Because his brushwork was compared with the leaves of bamboo grass, sasa, he was called Sasa Myohon. A number of "ink traces" from his brush are extant. The scroll at the Umezawa Kinenkan, with its relatively large characters, clearly shows the idio- syncracy of his handwriting. The signature 278 "The Oldster [from the Hermitage of] Illusory Existence" indicates that the work dates probably from Zhongfeng Mingben's late years.

Seisetsu Shocho, 1274-1339); datable to between 1326 and 1339. Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 32 x 39.5 cm. Yamato Bunkakan, Nara. Cf. Nos. 4, 7, and 16. Qingzhuo Zhengcheng sprang from the Liu family in Lianjiang, Fuzhou, present- day Fujian Province. He was a younger brother of the Chan monk Yuejiang Zheng- yin (1267-after 1333). At the age of four- teen, Zhengcheng entered the Bao'en Monastery of Zhounan, where he studied under the guidance of his uncle Yuexi Shaoyuan and received tonsure. In the fol- lowing year, he was ordained a monk at Kaiyuansi. In 1296, he moved to the Jingci Monastery in Zhejiang Province, where the abbot Yuji Zhihui promoted him to the "chief seat", shouzuo (Jap. shuso). After his teacher died in 1300, Qingzhuo joined the monks of Lingyinsi and of the monastery on Ayuwangshan. Among his confreres was Gulin Qingmao (1262- 1329) who was to become a very influen- tial Chan master. In the sixth month of 1326, at the age of fifty-two, Qingzhuo Zhengcheng travelled to Japan at the invitation of HOjo Takatoki (1303-1333, reigned 1311 -1333). The group he journeyed with included the returning Japanese pilgrim monks Mu'in Genkai (before 1310-1358), Jakushitsu Genkb (1290-1367), Kosen Ingen (1295- 1374), and Sekishitsu Zenkyui (1294- 1389). His friendship with these monks greatly facilitated his beginnings in Japan, and after a short time he was able to take over the abbacy of great Zen institutions in Kamakura. There, he was appointed the 21 st abbot of Kenchbji on the twelfth day of the third month in 1327. Two years later, he was called to Jbchiji as abbot, and in 1330, he became the 16th abbot of Engakuji. The efforts of Seisetsu Shocho - as Qingzhuo Zhengcheng was called in Japan - to adapt Chinese monastic rules to Japanese conditions, and his erudition in classical literature, especially in the reli- 280 gious poetry epitomized by his fellow stu- dent Gulin Qingmao, brought him high esteem in Japan. His fame preceded him to the capital, and the Emperor Go Daigo (reigned 1318-1339) invited him to Kyoto. On the twentieth day of the tenth month in 1333, the Emperor appointed him 23rd abbot of Kenninji. Three years later, the monarch offered him the prestigious posi- tion of 14th abbot of Nanzenji. The pow- erful Ogasawara Sadamune (1294-1350), ruler over several provinces, had also heard of the Chinese Zen master, and asked him to found the Kaizenji in the old province of Shinano, modern Nagano Prefecture. On the 17th day of the first month in the year 1339 Qingzhuo Zhengcheng died at the age of sixty-five. Before departing this world, he wrote his "death poem", yuige, which is still extant at the Tokiwa- yama Bunko in Kamakura (Fig. 77). Post- humously, the Imperial court honoured him with the title of Daikan Zenji, "Master of Meditation of the Great Mirror". His most important work is the monastic code entitled Daikan shingi, allegedly based on the classical canon of the Tang master Baizhang Huaihai (720-814). The last Hojo regent Takatoki, who had invited the Chinese abbot to Kamakura, was greatly concerned that these rules be adhered to in the monasteries under his patronage. The Yamato Bunkakan scroll shows a "regulated seven-syllable poem", shichigon zekku, in four lines. It is an answer to a Zen abbot, ho]o, of Reishbji, in which the author Seisetsu Shocho expresses thanks for a gift of mushrooms and chestnuts he had received from his colleague. Judging from the full, fluid brushwork, the poem was composed during the prelate's late years. It is dated to the 13th day of the ninth month, but without indication of the year: The following rhyme reverently presented with many thanks: [To the] abbot, hojo, of Reish i/i], [the for- mer] head trainee, zagen, Kikushu, master of meditation.

Pair of hanging scrolls. Ink on paper. 34 x 77.7 cm and 35.2 x 74.4 cm. Rokub'in, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 29. One of the two scrolls shows the name Shun'oku, "Spring Abode", in two large, vigorous characters. This is the spiritual "path name", ddgd, which Muso Soseki gave to his nephew and one of his most important successors, Myoha, in 1346. Zen disciples were given such clerical names by their teachers when they had successfully completed certain parts of their studies. Names of monasteries and localities, or terms for the positive qualities and virtues of the candidates were often selected for such epithets. On the other scroll, there is a dogoju, a verse explaining and poetically elaborating the name in four lines of seven syllables each, shichigon zekku. However, the qua- train is written in five lines, followed by a two-line dedication to the recipient, and a signature. At first sight, the poem does not seem to be a religious verse at all, but rather a lyri- cal impression of the beginning of spring. Muso Soseki eulogizes the fragrant blos- soms that adorn the branches; he praises the harmonious life-breath in front of his house and the lustre of spring at the rivers and shores. The erudite author employs for this poem a flourishing metaphorical language. The hundred blossoms of a branch in the opening line refer to the dis- ciples of his Zen lineage, who disperse their master's doctrine - like the fragrance of the blossoms spreading in all direc- tions. The two "ink traces" were brushed in the spring of 1346, when Muso Soseki had retired from his duties as abbot of Tenryuji to Ungo'an at Nishiyama, five years prior to his death. For the name, the seventy- one year old master and eminent gozan poet chose a powerful, dynamic style of cursive writing, sosho, while the accom- 282 panying verse is written in a softer, fluid, almost dancing form of semi-cursive script, gydsho. Both scrolls are signed Bokutotsusd, the "Old Wooden Stutterer", and sealed Muso; the scroll with the poem bears in addition the seal Shamon [monk] Soseki.

Hanging scroll from a set of ten. Ink on decorated paper. 33.4 x 33A4 cm. Shbkokuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juyd Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 18, 22, 33, and 45. The "Ten Oxherding Poems", jugyuju, are a classical Zen parable for the spirit of enlightenment which the Zen adept has to capture, tame, and overcome. The way toward this goal is described in ten stages, and often illustrated with corresponding scenes frequently shown in a circle. The first series of text and illustrations known is by the Chan master Guo'an Shiyuan (active around 1150). According to that version, the ten stages of the popular parable are the following: 1. JingyD - "Looking for the Ox", i.e., the start of the search for the primeval, true Self, honshin. 2. Kenseki - "Seeing the Footprints of the Ox", i.e., slowly approaching the ox and beginning its pursuit. 3. Kengyu- "Seeing the Ox", i.e., keep- ing the goal of enlightenment, satori, before one's eyes. 4. Tokugyu - "Catching the Ox", i.e., to grasp and hold the possibility of satori. 5. Bokugyu - "Herding the Ox", i.e., to tend and further the attained enlight- enment. 6. Kigyu kika - "Returning Home on the Back of the Ox", i.e., to resume one's daily life while keeping one's attained enlightenment. 7. Bogyu sonjin - "The Ox Forgotten, the Man Remains", i.e., the goal has been reached, the objective world and one- self have become one. 8. Ningyu gubb - "Both Man and Ox Forgotten", i.e., everything dissolves in the primeval emptiness, ku. 284 9. Henpon gengen - "Returning to the Fundamental, Back to the Source", i.e., all things of this world have attained their original nature and com- pleted Buddhahood, honraijobutsu. 10. Nitten'suishu - "Entering the City with Hands Hanging Down", i.e., to mingle with the people in one's enlightened condition and instruct them. This set of ten hanging scrolls has tradi- tionally been revered as representative masterwork from the brush of the Zen abbot and great gozan poet Zekkai Chu-shin. The prose lines by Guo'an Shi- yuan and the explanatory poems in "re- gulated four-line seven-syllable" meter, shichigon zekku, by the Japanese literatus monk, bunjinso, are brushed in careful "regular script", kaisho. The paper used for the scrolls is imported from China. It is decorated, in a batik-like technique, called rosen in Japanese, with figures, waves, fish, and water plants. Ornamental bor- ders lined with pearl-strings frame the cel- ebrated handwriting. When the prominent Zen prelate Zekkai Chushin was asked by the just abdicated third Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimitsu (1358- 1408, reigned 1367-1394) in 1395 to ex- plain the fundamental tenets of Zen, the illustrious master based his lessons on the easily understood "Oxherding" parable. It does not seem far-fetched to surmise that for these lessons, Zekkai Chu-shin wrote this set of prose lines with his explanatory poems extant at Shbkokuji in Kybto. Perhaps a set of paintings originally ac- companied the master's "ink traces". The paper of the scroll selected here is decorated with carp and sea grass. The text refers to the second stage on the way toward enlightenment, entitled at the right Kenseki - "Seeing the Footprints of Ox". It signals the beginning insight attained by the study of the doctrine and the holy scriptures. At this point, the student catches at least a glimpse of the truth, but without being able himself to differentiate between erroneous and correct teaching, between deception and truth. Although he has found the footprints of the ox, he is still removed from the gate to the true insight. Zekkai Chu-shin's explanatory verse at the left may be translated as follows: Under the trees at the shore, footprints of the ox can be seen here and there. Has the herdboy found the way in the midst of the dense, fragrant grass? However far the buffalo may run, to the farthest corner of the deep mountains, His nose reaches nevertheless the heavens, and he cannot hide himself. E.A./H.

Left hanging scroll of a diptych. Ink on paper. 133.3 x 41.8 cm. Shinju'an, Daitokuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 30, 31, and 46. The Japanese term for a calligraphy con- sisting of a single line on a narrow, vertical scroll is ichigycsho, "one line writing". The type was used first by Japanese Zen mas- ters in the thirteenth century. It does not seem to have been practised in China, but Chinese masters staying in Japan used the format. Vertical scrolls of this type were especially suitable for titles, honorary names, or short, striking sentences. The two scrolls by IkkyO Sbjun at Shinju'an of Daitokuji belong to the great master- works of the East Asian art of writing. The Buddhist maxim shown on the scrolls consists of two parallel lines of four char- acters each. It comes from a didactic stanza of four lines, the Shichibutsu tsikai no ge, regarded as a fundamental source of Buddhist belief. Since time immemorial, this maxim proclaimed and commanded by the "Seven Buddhas of the Past", Kako Shichibutsu, has served as admonishing tenet for the Buddhist way of life. In the version of the sixth Buddha of the Past, Kashb Butsu or Kayapa, the complete verse reads as follows: Avoid all Evil. Pursue all Good. Cleanse your thoughts: This is the teaching of all Buddhas. The magnificent "ink traces", bokuseki, by the courageous, self-confident, and up- right Zen master IkkyO Sbjun show the first two lines of this clearly evident maxim, to be read in Japanese: Shoaku makusa, shuzen bugyc. On the left scroll of the dip- tych, rendering the second line of the striking stanza, IkkyO brushed the first character in well legible regular script, kaisho, setting it slightly apart spatially as well as by the jet-black tone of the ink. The three following characters are joined together under the pressure and the speed 286 of the bristly, spreading brush in increas- ingly abbreviating "cursive script", scsho. Not once did the brush leave the paper in its racing course through the three char- acters. The same applies to the signature Kycunshi hitsu, "By the brush of the Master of the Crazy Cloud" (Fig. 73). Flex- ibly undulating, the epithet flows down in elegant flourishes and is visually sup- ported by the square IkkyG seal. Even without signature and seal, the writer of this striking line would be easy to identify, especially because of the inimitable feel- ing of fleeting speed in the characteristic rough brushwork. These "ink traces", which deserve that designation as does no other type of writing, fully reveal the strong, outspoken personality of the un- compromising Zen master.

Inscription by Baisetsu Sei'in (unknown). Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 65.7 x 48.4 cm. Kozo Yabumoto Collection, Amagasaki. As early as the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), grapevines and grapes were part of the repertory of some painters in China. But they became a common sub- ject only during the Yuan Dynasty (1279- 1368), when artists such as Riguan Ziwen (also Zhongyan, active late 13th century) turned to the subject in free, playful handl- ing of brush and ink. Riguan's paintings did not aspire to a realistic representation of the outer appearance of the plant and its fruit, as his contemporaries did with the so-called "boneless manner", mokkotsu- ho. Riguan's objective was to capture the inner character of his subject. For this, he preferred to use rough, dynamic brush- work, a wide range of ink tonalities, as well as contrasts resulting from wet and dry ink, shbboku. The grapevine by Yt'e Gukei is greatly influenced by the style of the Yuan master Riguan. His rhythmically painted vine with its supple leaves, some of them already withered at the edge, is skillfully rendered with dry and wet ink freely running into each other. The result is a convincing impression of the plant's life force which has ripened the succulent grapes. Growth and decay, ripening and wilting within the rhythm of nature are vividly shown in this grapevine, flung on the paper in rapid, vir- tuoso brushstrokes. The eminent painter-monk and Zen abbot TesshO Tokusai (died 1366), YuL'e Gukei's teacher, is also said to have painted grapevines. It seems as if Gukei wanted to emulate Tesshui in his work. The painter signed the scroll at the left edge: Gukei Dalin hitsu, "By the brush of Gukei Dojin". The unpretentious brushwork of the five rapidly written characters of the signature is well adapted to the untrammeled style of the painting. 288 The same evaluation applies to the in- scription in the upper right, written by a certain "Oldster Baisetsu", Baisetsu'c. It has been suggested that this Baisetsu'o is identical with Sesson Ytbai (1290-1346), one of the eminent founding figures of "Five-Mountain Literature", gozan bun- gaku, a literary form imported from China and practised in the great Japanese Zen monasteries. In 1343, Sesson Ytbai be- came abbot of Manjuji in Kybto, and one year before his death he was appointed the 30th abbot of Kenninji. The round seal contains the two charac- ters Sei'in; the author of the inscription thus is known to have used the name Baisetsu Sei'in. H.Y.

Inscription by the painter. Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 98.2 x 37.5 cm. Kybto National Museum. Cf. Nos. 48, 52, and 53. Gyoku'en Bonpo was a Rinzai monk from the school of Muso Kokushi (1275-1351). Unfortunately, contemporary sources pro- vide but scant material on his life and work. The gozan literatus Gido Shutshin (1325-1388) mentions him several times in his diary notes, the first time in 1370. At that time, Gyoku'en Bonpo was a monk at Toshoji in Kamakura. At the beginning of the 1380s he must have moved to Kyoto, where he was to become one of the most important figures in the Zen coterie of the capital. In the third month of 1413, he was called to the office of the highest Zen prelate in Japan, the abbacy of Nanzenji in the 81 st generation. The fourth Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimochi (1386-1428, reigned 1394-1423), himself a fervent Zen adept and enthusiastic painter, admired and favoured Bonpo greatly, and turned to the eminent painter-monk for his instruction in Zen Buddhism. Gyoku'en Bonpo showed his talent as poet in numerous inscriptions on paint- ings, extant especially on shigajiku, "scrolls with poems and painting", brushed at gatherings of learned literati monks, bun- jinso. For his paintings, Bonpo favoured the subject of the fragrant orchid with its supple leaves. Quite a number of enchant- ing paintings of his showing this typical lit- eratus subject are extant. The scroll at the Kyoto National Museum is an outstanding example of this type. The colophon by Gyoku'en Bonpo is judi- ciously and unusually placed into the bold composition at the lower left side. It is dedicated to a monk occupying the office of a "su-tra keeper", zosu. The second character of his name cannot be clearly deciphered, and his name may thus be Sodei, Soko, or K6 zosu. 290 In the upper left corner, the orchid has sunk its roots into the sparse ground of an overhanging cliff, kengai, while its long, slender leaves droop down in elegant curves. From the lower right, a thin bam- boo accompanied by a thorny branch grows upwards toward the left, creating a juxtaposed tension with the dangling orchid. Evidently, the artist projected his own rela- tionship with the recipient into the paint- ing: in the colophon, he compares himself with the bamboo, while likening the virtue and the eminence of the suttra keeper with the distinguished orchid, growing at an un- reachable height. In this painting, Gyoku- en Bonpb is reverently looking up to one of his confreres. The scroll is an impres- sive example of how painting and poetry can complement each other, and finally reach a synthesis: shiga itchi, "poem and painting in perfect unison".

Inscription by Zekkai ChOshin (1336-1405). Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 129 x 35.5 cm. Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, Osaka. Important Cultural Property, Juyo Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 22, 23, and 41. Ever since the early Southern Song Dynasty, plum blossoms, bamboo, and similar subjects were favourite topics for "ink plays", moxi, of the Chinese literati. During the fourteenth century, they became popular in Japan as well, espe- cially among learned Zen monks. This enchanting scroll with blossoming plum branches, owned by the Masaki Bijutsu- kan, belongs among the oldest plum blos- som paintings extant in Japan. It bears a colophon by the Zen abbot Zekkai ChO- shin, who played a central part in the "Literature of the Five Mountains", gozan bungaku. The inscription is signed with his literatus name Shoken, and bears his seal Zekkai. The blossoming plum branches are painted with fluid brushstrokes. The white blossoms stand out from the even, grey ink wash of the background. In the inscription, Zekkai Chushin mentions the "silhouette of the branches against the moonlight of the dusk", an evening mood that has been captured convincingly in the painting. There is no signature or seal of the painter on the scroll. The anthology of poems and prose texts by Zekkai Chtshin, known under the title Shbkenkb, "Draft Manuscript of Shbken", mentions that this scroll originally be- longed to a pair. The companion piece, however, is no longer extant. The well- informed Zekkai Chtshin indicates a cer- tain "Mad Guest from KyushO", KyushO Kyokaku, as the painter of the diptych, but he gives no further details. According to a quite convincing theory, the artist is the celebrated Josetsu, who came from KyushO and was active at Shbkokuji around 1400. There, Zekkai Chushin bestowed the name Josetsu on him. Even though it cannot be ascertained that Josetsu is actually the painter of this scroll, it is known that the great Zen 292 monasteries as well as the Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimochi (1386-1428) commis- sioned paintings from him. It is thought that it was Yoshimochi who asked Josetsu to render a Zen parable in a painting, and thus caused the painter- monk to create his most famous painting, the Hyonen zu, on which an old man at a mountain creek tries to catch a slippery catfish with a narrow-necked gourd. Thirty- one Zen monks, among them such lumi- naries as Daigaku Shcsc (1345-1423), Gyoku'en Bonpb (1348-after 1420), Gen- chl Shigaku (1359-1428), and Daigu Shbchi (died 1439), composed short poems on that subject, most likely during a literary gathering. These poems were subsequently mounted together with Josetsu's painting "Trying to Catch a Catfish with a Gourd" at Taizb'in of Myo- shinji (Fig. 125).

Ink on paper. 68.4 x 34.5 cm. MOA Bijutsukan, Atami. Cf. Nos. 30, 31, and 42. The Zen master Ikkyu Sbjun, extremely popular in Japan to this day, was a rest- less wanderer who disliked assuming offi- cial positions. Only for a short time did he consent to be the abbot of Daitokuji in Kybto, which is not one of the gozan monasteries. He sought to teach Zen in the open streets among the common peo- ple, using unconventional methods. He was in contact with the most important representatives of the then popular and widely spread school of linked verse, renga, of the tea ceremony, chadc, of the No theatre, as well as with eminent painters and writers. On many of these artists, he exerted great influence. Ikkyt's own artistic efforts were devoted mainly to poetry and the art of writing, but he was also an amateur ink painter. Among his favourite subjects was the plum blossom; several truly artless ver- sions of this theme by his hand have come down to us. The narrow hanging scroll at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami shows a bare plum branch with a few sparse blos- soms, rising vertically along the right edge. Along the opposite, left edge, the signature, giving the clerical lineage of the artist, runs down almost from top to bot- tom of the scroll, ending just above the name seal IkkyG in the lower left corner. The long signature thus forms a counter- weight to the upwards growing plum branch on the right. The three-line poetic inscription in Ikkyt's unmistakable hand- writing at the top of the scroll lends the composition a certain stability. This ama- teurish "ink play" or bokugi reveals the joy of handling brush and ink, as well as the free, untrammeled spirit of a master of meditation who ignored conventions and rules, even likening himself to a "Crazy Cloud", Kybun.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 90.6 x 30.3 cm. Yamato Bunkakan, Nara. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 12. A number of ink paintings bear the seals Ka'o and Ninga, such as the Yamato Bunkakan scroll, but not all are authentic beyond doubt. The charming painting of a solitary sparrow on a rock under a bam- boo, considered among the best of its kind, is generally thought of as an undis- puted masterwork by Ka'o. From the left, two wind-blown bamboo branches - painted in different ink tonalities - project into the picture. The leaf ends are dishev- elled, rapidly brought to paper with a bristly, jumping brush. Below, a small sparrow is standing on one leg on a rock rendered with broad, light-grey ink washes. The bird holds up its head, as if to test the wind with its beak. With a skill- ful mixture of delicate washes, dots, and somewhat broader strokes in various nuances of grey, as well as with a few pre- cise, jet-black accents, the painter has successfully breathed life into the bird, characterized its soft plumage, strikingly rendered its legs and the pointed beak, and firmly captured its movements. In all this, he does not use any contour lines. A closely related scroll bearing the same artist seals at the Umezawa Kinenkan in Tokyo shows three sparrows on and around a blossoming plum branch (Fig. 137). No doubt the artist observed the birds over a long period of time, intensely and with loving affection, before he could conjure them up on paper as convincingly. In its composition limited to a few basic elements, the Yamato Bunkakan scroll is reminiscent of a work at the Nezu Museum, Tokyo, attributed to the Chinese painter- monk Muqi (active 13th century). On that scroll, a pair of sparrows are closely hud- dling together on a rain-soaking branch protruding from a cluster of bamboo leaves; early connoisseurs already called the scroll affectionately "Wet Sparrows". Even if that painting may not actually have 294 been the model for Ka'b's sparrows, there is no doubt that the Japanese painter- monk intensively studied monochrome ink painting as practised by the Chinese Song masters, a mode of painting which was greatly admired in medieval Japanese Zen circles. Due to its superb quality, the sparrow scroll is a key work in the oeuvre of Ka'o. It is stylistically closely related to the pic- ture of Kensu Osho, "Reverend Prawn Fisher", at the Tokyo National Museum, in its overall composition as well as in the technique of the sparse landscape ele- ments (Fig. 2). The small, angular rocks cut off by the lower edge, painted with intensely dark ink without any contours and showing the white of the paper ground in places, indicate the same hand at work. The empty ground remains unde- fined in both works, lending the composi- tion open width. The eye of the viewer is immediately directed to the small bird. Its presence defines spatial depth in the painting. Without the bird, the environ- ment would remain undefined, flat, and incomprehensible. The reduction of the depicted elements to sparrow, bamboo, and rock, their bold compositional arrange- ment on the left side of the scroll, and the line of sight of the bird convey a feeling of limitless space and atmospheric depth, a sensation of secluded calm, emptiness, and the infinite life breath of nature. The inclination of many Zen masters toward the simple joys of life made them so affectionate toward sparrows that they would dedicate poems to the bird. IkkyO Sojun (1394-1418) even wrote a requiem upon the death of his beloved sparrow, to whom he had given the name Sonrin, "Forest of Venerability" (Fig. 138). H.Y./H. B. !'

Ink on paper. 131.7 x 37.3 cm. Agency for Cultural Affairs, Bunkachb, Tokyo. Important Cultural Property, Juyd Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 44, 52, and 53. The traditional Chinese literati theme of the "Three Wintry Friends", suihan sanyou or setsuri sanyO, was very popular among poets and painters in medieval Zen circles in Japan. Pine, bamboo, and plum remain strong or even green in the midst of win- ter; the plum tree may even burst into bloom under the weight of fresh snow. These three trees represent the elemen- tary, unbroken life force of nature. They are therefore a most suitable metaphor for the ideal of the Zen monk, who does not yield to the temptations and threats of the world, but remains true and unaffected by change and outside influences. This painting is highly esteemed because of its outstanding quality and because it is the oldest representation of the setsuri sanyO theme extant in Japan. The eulo- gies by five prominent Zen monks indicate that the work dates probably to the sec- ond decade of the fifteenth century. The composition is dominated by two upright, sturdy pine trees standing close by each other. They are joined by a bam- boo bending under a heavy load of snow, and a blossoming plum tree with bizarre branches. The long pine needles seem to have ice at their pointed ends; the abun- dant clusters seem to be bristling from the cold. Effective contrast of light and dark gives the tree trunks their plasticity and their characteristic surface texture. Every- thing is painted with wet, vigorous ink and partly with graphic precision and detailed density, conveying a feeling of heaviness and profusion. The background is covered with a light-grey ink wash, ji'nuri, while the ground and other parts are left white in reserve. This gives the effect of snow cov- ered parts and a sombre, wintry mood. 296 Although the scroll bears neither signature nor seal, the exceptional technique and the style of the painting indicate a master in the circle of the Zen painter-monk Mincho (1351 -1431) active at TOfukuji in Kybto.

Ink on paper. 96.5 x 39.7 cm. Klaus F. Naumann Collection, Tokyo. Magnificent, colourful lotus flowers and water birds in a pond were a popular sub- ject in China ever since the Five Dynasties (907-960), especially in the environs of Suzhou and Hangzhou within the Jiangnan region. The professional painters of the Southern Song and Yuan Dynasties con- tinued this tradition, but besides the colourful versions, they also created ink paintings, either monochrome or in ink and only light colours. Under the influence of such works, the subject was taken up by Japanese painters as early as the Kamakura period (1185-1333), although no such works are extant. The scroll in the Naumann Collection be- longs to this genre. It has been suggested that the painting may have been part of a seasonal diptych, showing the birds in a summer and a winter setting. While the companion piece in the Powers Collection represents the summer setting, the pre- sent scroll shows the winter scene. In the center, two white egrets, shirasagi, stand closely side by side in the shallow water of a lotus pond. At the right edge, a lotus leaf destroyed by the frost is hanging limply down, and the chalice of a withered lotus flower on a dry, angular stem juts into the painting from the right. A king- fisher is perched on a precariously sway- ing reedgrass. The egrets with their white plumage and the icy, only slightly agitated water surface are left in reserve against the grey wash of the background in a technique called sotoguma. The long beaks and legs of the egrets as well as the beak and the wing feathers of the kingfisher are accentuated with jet-black ink. The other elements of the composition are painted without con- tours, in the "boneless manner", mokkotsu- ho, using loose, free brushstrokes of a 298 light grey. The whisk of the reedgrass on the left edge of the painting is done in a technique called fukizumi; having satu- rated the brush with ink, the artist blew over the top hair of the brush, spraying the ink on the paper in a mottled pattern. In the upper half, near the right edge, the scroll bears the square seal Kinkei. The artist was most likely the painter-monk Kinkei Ryobin, active toward the end of the fifteenth century and, by various accounts, said to have studied under Shubun (active ca.1423-1460). He is also said to have emulated the Song master Muqi (died between 1269 and 1274) so popular in Japan, and to have specialized in figure painting as well as in bird and flower subjects.

Ink on paper. 26 x 48 cm. Tokiwayama Bunko, Kamakura. Important Cultural Property, JOyb Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 51, 60, and 61. The mynah bird, acridotheres cristatellus, with black plumage, a white wing dot, and a prominent front protuberance, is native to Southern China. In East Asia, the mynah is revered as auspicious bird, zuichb in Japanese. The Chinese painter-monk Muqi, active during the first half and the middle of the thirteenth century, played a major role in the popularity of the bird as a pictorial subject especially among Japa- nese Zen artists. Several versions of the theme by the painter-monk Sesson Shukei are extant. But the scroll at the Tokiwa- yama Bunko has traditionally been con- sidered one of his undisputed master- works. In the upper right corner, the painting bears the often-used seal Sesson in the shape of an archaic Chinese ding bronze vessel. Sesson hailed from the north-eastern coastal province of Hitachi and spent most of his life in Kantb, far removed from the capital Kybto. As a young man, he entered a Zen monastery, most likely Shbsbji, founded in 1341 by Muso Soseki (1275- 1351) and known as the family monastery of the Satake clan, rulers of the region. There, Sesson seems to have received tonsure. He is said to have learned paint- ing on his own, and he came to consider himself as the successor of Sesshui (1420-1506). The first character of his name, "Snow Village" and some remarks in his Setsu monteishi, "Instructions to Students", are testament to this aspiration of his. The treatise written before 1542 contains the following self-confident pas- sage and, in the translation of Barbara Ford (1980, p. 18), reads: Now, as for studying the paintings of for- mer masters, if you strive only to emulate their brushwork, your own painting will not profit. For example, even with the paint- ings of SesshO whom / took as master, it 300 was difficult to borrow and still maintain the integrity of my own brush. When copy- ing in reverence to a master of the past, it is not your own brush at work. Therefore, in painting, in other words, in the patterns which recreate the universe, the brush should be handled with the strength of your own conviction, even though mod- eled and trained on the brushwork of your teachers. If you do not perform in this way, you cannot call the painting your own. I have studied Sesshu many years, but see how different my style is from his. Around the middle of the sixteenth cen- tury, Sesson stayed for a short time in Kamakura and Odawara, where he en- joyed the favour and support of the influ- ential Hbjb rulers. Through the Hojo family he was likely to have had access to origi- nals of the Song painters Muqi and Yuqian in their old family collection. These models Sesson kept studying throughout his artistic career. It is therefore not surprising that he came to master the spontaneous, abbreviating ink technique so success- fully. This mastery can also be seen in the mynah bird scroll. With a few bold washes in fine gradations of the ink tonalities, he has, so to speak, "portrayed" the bird in profile on a promontory slightly descend- ing toward the right. The humorous ex- pression and the impudent attitude of the bird admirably reflect the self-conscious idiom of the independent artist. The left third of the horizontal scroll bears a four-line inscription dated to the "ninth month in autumn" of 1555. The author of the eulogy, Keisho Shu-zui, signed with the name Shin Dojin, "Sage of the Four Seals", and added three seals: one in the shape of an archaic Chinese bronze ves- sel, and below it two square name seals, Emo and Keisho. He was the 152nd abbot of Engakuji in Kamakura. The colophon is testament both to Sesson's presence in Kamakura and his close contacts with the leading Zen clergy there. He was probably fifty-one years old when he painted the Tokiwayama Bunko hahachd. With its exactly dated inscription, the scroll is of inestimable value for the reconstruction of Sesson's artistic career.

Ink on paper. 120.7 x 47.2 cm. Takashi Yanagi Collection, Kyoto. Cf. Nos. 50, 60, and 61. According to tradition, Sesson Shukei was born in the small village of Hetare in Ota in the province of Hitachi, present-day Iba- raki Prefecture, probably in 1504. He is said to have been a descendant of the Satake family, which ruled the region at the time. Sources further tell us that for some un- specified reason, Sesson became a Zen monk. In the 1540's, he went to the province of Iwashiro, modern Fukushima Prefecture, where he worked under the patronage of Ashina Moriuji (1521-1580) and in 1546 instructed the powerful lord of Aizu in painting. Around the middle of the century, Sesson stayed in Odawara and Kamakura, returning to Aizu sometime during the 1560s. Toward 1573, he seems to have stopped his peregrinations, and settled in neighbouring Miharu, a village in the province of Iwaki, today's Fukushima Prefecture. There, he seems to have spent the rest of his life, more than a decade, in prolific artistic activity under the patronage of the Tamura family. As models for his painting, Sesson chose the revered Zen master SesshO Toyb (1420-1506), and the Song artists Muqi and Yujian, at the time highly influential in Japan. Although Sesson could paint in a quite conservative manner, as his chinzb of the Zen abbot Iten Sbsei (1472-1554) dated to 1550 shows, he also developed his own style from the very beginning. Thus he introduced new forms of compo- sition and expression, atmospheric and emotional effects, as well as unusual sub- jects. In some works, he also brought the combination of painting and writing to new heights and innovative dimensions. The charming scroll of monkeys hunting a crab is a representative example of Ses- son's animal paintings. An almost roguish sense of humor emanates from it. In a bamboo grove, half hidden behind a small 302 knoll, three elder monkeys watch with amusement a younger monkey in the fore- ground trying to catch a frightened crab, most likely to play with it. Especially strik- ing are the frontal views of the monkeys' almost human faces, indicated with a few vigorous dots and lines. Their bristly pelt is rendered with a dry brush in dense hatch- ings. The strangely bent bamboo veering to the left and the right give the composi- tion a dynamic vertical element, typical of Sesson's innovative handling of pictorial motifs. The volume of the bamboo stalks is convincingly rendered with gradated washes by a broad brush and accentu- ated, jet-black lines indicating the joints. The scroll consists of four sheets of hori- zontal paper joined together. Their size and the unusual placement of the signa- ture seem to indicate that the painting was originally the extreme left panel of a six- fold screen. The signature reads: "Painting by the Old [ShO]kei Sesson". The seal below contains the characters of his sobriquet Kakusen, "Crane Boat". vahI US Mv. ta 4;R -v-- at 'a, Sintr'4 el fSso hje</page><page sequence="295">SEf \ --i * NhE ::'''' S ::&lt;&lt; ... . .. 1 | 5 .................. ^ 7 ' ','._, . i ;,f,+7wS 7 ... . t w ) '* t ''.: : m 2 r ''* w ,' 5 .

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 101.5 x 34.5 cm. Konchi'in, Nanzenji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juy5 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 27, 44, 48, and 53. "Hidden Cottage by a Mountain Brook" represents the shosaizu, "pictures of a [scholar's] studio", as this type of shiga- jiku, "scrolls with poems and painting", is known. The enchanting landscape paint- ing at Konchi'in is the oldest extant exam- ple of this kind, which became popular in the first half of the fifteenth century. The cottage mentioned in the title stands at the centre of the well-balanced compo- sition. Built partly on the shore of the brook, it is an open, straw-thatched hut, bO'oku, partly on stilts in the water, sur- rounded by a narrow terrace with a low railing. A door curtain is drawn sideways, showing the floor of the room with the square slabs. The cottage is empty. No one is to be seen anywhere. The calm of nature emanates from the scene, and the man-built structure blends into its natural environment harmoniously. Above the ridge of the roof, the gable of an added structure is visible. From the right, a mas- sive rock with a group of trees on top juts into the painting in front of the hut. On the left shore of the widening brook, another cluster of trees grows on the steep shore. Three angular boulders protruding from the water indicate the shallowness of the brook. In midground, partly leafless tree tops emerge from the mist. The mountain chain in the background, cleft in the centre and vanishing in the haze on both sides, aligns the composition clearly along a central, vertical axis; at the same time, it gives the painting convincing spatial depth and width. This older composition is different from the so-called "one-corner mode", henka- kukei, transmitted by Josetsu (active early 15th century) and Shubun (active ca. 1423-1460). The artist of this evocative painting is not known, but it has been tra- 304 ditionally attributed to the painter-monk Kichizan Minchb of Tbfukuji. Immediately above the landscape painting is a preface, jo, dated to 1413, by Taihaku Shingen, 90th abbot of Kenninji in Kybto. Above the preface, six more renowned Zen monks from Kybto, among them the celebrated orchid painter Gyoku'en Bonpb, added poems, daishi, to the scroll. The preface tells us that the scroll was painted for a special occasion. The painter-monks had gathered at Nanzenji in order to inaugurate a new study which the monk Shihaku [?Ijun had named Kei'n, "Hidden by the Mountain Brook". Although the name of the painter is not mentioned, the preface and the poems contain valu- able information about the background and the date of this important work. "Paintings of a Scholar's Study" with their poetic overtones are not only testament to the common artistic interests of the Zen masters, but they also document their fre- quent gatherings for literary activities and intellectual exchange. They are multi-lay- ered, complex works of art of extremely personal character, a synthesis of poetry, painting, and writing. Their popularity reveals the Zen masters longing for a sim- ple life in the calm of seclusion. Thus, numerous small structures, tatchu, with a study, shoin, imitating secluded straw- thatched hermitages in the mountains, were built on the vast precincts of the metropolitan Zen monasteries at that time.

Inscriptions by DaishO ShOchb (1348-1419), Gyoku'en Bonpb (1348-after 1420), Kengan Genchu (died 1421), Sei'in Shunjo (1358-1422), Daigaku ShOsu (1345-1423), Kiyb Hoshu (1361 -1424), Keichu Shbga (1363-1425), IchO Tsujo (1349-1429), and Isho Tokugan (1360-1437); datable to before 1419. Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 119.8 x 35.4 cm. Idemitsu Bijutsukan, Tokyo. Cf. Nos. 18, 44, 48, and 52. The "Study of Blossom Anticipation", Taikaken, also known as the "Study of Spring Expectation", Taishunken, is situ- ated at the bottom of a gorge on the far side of a lake or river limited by the lower edge of the scroll. It is framed and pro- tected by two steep slopes on its left and right. Two gnarled pine trees on the right contrast with the bizarre branches of a plum tree, as well as with the ground from which they grow. They stand on more gently descending, softer ground than the plum tree growing from behind a jagged, steep boulder. Mist clouds the midground, and only a solitary top of a fir tree appears as if before a veil. In the background, a mountain range rises from the mist in the right half of the painting. The centre of the painting shows a solidly built, well tended estate. In the courtyard, a servant is sweeping away fallen leaves. The roofs of the buildings, as well as the wall surrounding the garden on the right, are covered with tiles. The sliding doors, shbji, of the entrance building are open, revealing the interior. Evidently, the build- ing is an "attached writing study" of a scholar, tsuke shoin, since in the elevated back of the room, one can see stacked boxes of book or painting scrolls. The owner, however, is absent. The picture seems to intimate that this is the home of a learned master of medita- tion who retired to the mountains, devot- ing his time fully to his artistic and literary endeavours and to the study of his books. He may have had a visitor and gone out, or he may be in another building of the estate. The empty study, the open doors, as well as the absence of the owner give the painting a sense of inviting openness and a certain general validity. The viewer is virtually asked to enter and make himself at home. The feeling emanating from the 306 painting lets the viewer project himself into this ideal realm of an unfettered scholar's life. The poets who wrote the colophons may have entered that scholarly retreat. In poetic form, they connect personal state- ments with the painting, and mention how the imminent arrival of spring and the opening of the plum blossoms can be compared to the anticipation of distin- guished guests. The first inscription in the upper right corner is by Daigaku Shus-s, the 46th abbot of Tenryutji and 71 st abbot of Nanzenji. The other writers, too, were eminent Zen masters in the gozan monas- teries of Kybto. The last inscription, along the lower left edge and intruding almost into the painting, was added by Gyoku'en Bonpb, famous for his elegant orchid paintings. The empty space between the second and the third inscription might indicate that another guest was expected at the meeting and did not come. Daishul Shulchb, a Zen master from the school of Muso Kokushi appointed the 17th prelate of Shbkokuji and 87th abbot of Nanzenji, died on the 24th day of the seventh month of 1419. Thus, we have a safe terminus ante quem for this work. Closely related in style as well as in the choice of motifs is another shosaizu, "pic- ture of a [scholar's] studio", dating to 1418, at the Seikadb Bunko, Tokyo, with the title San'ekisai, "Studio of the Three Worthies". Here, too, a scholar's retreat lies hidden in the mountains near a creek, surrounded by pine and plum trees, and a servant sweeps up fallen leaves in front. Gyoku'en Bonpb wrote a preface, jo, for the paint- ing, which is mounted on a separate hanging scroll. On the painting scroll itself, eight prominent Zen poet monks from Kybto wrote poems, daishi; four of them also contributed to the Taikaken scroll: Daishui Shutcho, Kengan Genchul, Kiyb Hoshu-, and Isho Tokugan. On the right edge above the background mountains, the scroll at the Idemitsu Museum bears a spurious seal - most likely added later - of the famous painter- monk Tenshb Shibun, active at Shokoku- ji. He is considered the actual founder of a typically Japanese tradition of ink painting to which the landscape painters of the Muromachi period are especially indebted. Although a number of works associated with Shutbun are characteristic for their Song-derived one-corner composition, henkakukei, the balanced composition of the Idemitsu scroll lacks the concentration of all pictorial elements in one corner. However, the brushwork and the skillful, sparse use of sharp contour lines as well as gradated washes bespeak a high tech- nical level. The work is likely to date to the initial phase of the typical Shutbun style in which elements of Chinese academic painting can still be detected.

Hanging scroll. Ink on paper. 100.9 x 29.8 cm. Agency for Cultural Affairs, Bunkachb, Tokyo. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. On this scroll, also known as Shuko sdbetsu, "Farewell with Boat", the inscrip- tions assume a much more important place than the painting itself. It is a "fare- well painting", sdbetsuzu, which the writ- ers of the colophons gave to a friend and confrere. In the upper right corner, Nankb Sogen (1387-1463) has written the title of the scroll: So - Shikei shdnen kankyb, "Farewell - Return of the Youngster Shikei to the Capital". The title is followed by a melancholy poem, also by Nanko Sogen, of the "regulated seven-syllable" type, shichigon zekku. The poem talks about the ship leaving toward the north, about the vastness of the water outlasting the pain of parting, and about the solitary sea- gull ten thousand miles away sighing night after night. The next two verses are by Kosei Ryuiha, the 154th abbot of Kenninji and 144th abbot of Nanzenji, and by Shinden Seiha, the 157th and 161 st abbot of the same monasteries, respectively. The two poems below are by Zuikei Shihob (right) and Zuigan Ryusei (left). The sixth poem in the lower left is by the otherwise unknown Zen monk Bonki. Shuho was the 50th abbot of Shbkokuji, and Ryusei the 171st prelate of Kenninji, as well as the 181st of Nanzenji. All participating monks were evidently high-ranked members of the Zen clergy in Kybto. The poems deal with parting, the pain of taking leave, the vastness of the sea and the drifting clouds, wild geese, and sea- gulls. Some of the poet-monks use classi- cal metaphors for the parting young fellow monk, comparing him to the sun sinking below the horizon, and the vanishing moon. One poem says that even the birds following the boat understand the grief of parting in the hearts of men. The biography of the young monk Shikei is not clear. According to the inscriptions, he 308 studied several years under Nankb Sogen at Izumi in the old province of Kawachi, the region of present-day Osaka, and then returned to the capital. "Farewell scrolls with poems and painting", sdbetsu shiga- jiku, together with "[scholar's] studio scrolls with poems and painting", shosai shiga- jiku, were a common and popular type, although few are extant today. The in- scriptions on the scroll seem to be all from the same hand. However, this does not necessarily mean that the scroll is a later copy; there are other genuine examples where this is the case. The painting can- not be later than 1446, the year of death of Kosei Ryuha, but this date is not a secure terminus ante quem for the dating of the scroll. However, the style of the painting as well as of the calligraphy sup- ports a date around the middle of the fif- teenth century. The extremely sparse painting shows a sailing boat reduced to a drawing-like sim- plicity floating on the vast water's surface with a small boat in tow. Eight people are in the boat. Although the sail is fully swollen by the wind, the water, perhaps Lake Biwa, is calm and its surface shows only small waves. Close to the lower edge of the scroll, three wild geese fly toward the right, while three more swim toward the left. By showing the birds moving in opposite directions, the artist may have wanted to express the idea of separation and of possible reunion. He has re- nounced any indication of background, such as distant mountains, in order to inti- mate the vastness of space. The feeling of solitude in this ascetic, but extremely ef- fective composition is further enhanced by the distance between the wild geese near the shore and the sailing boat on the water.

Medieval Japanese Zen painters rarely depicted the scenery of their native coun- try. In this scroll, however, Mt. Fuji, the "Sacred Mountain" of Japan, towers maj- estically in the centre of the painting. Below the pine-grown shore of Miho can be seen. The painting thus shows a clearly identifiable scenic view based on the local characteristics of the place. Fishermen are at work in their boats and on the shore. A small village is half hidden in a bamboo grove, and the roofs of a monastery emerge from the mist in midground on the left edge. In front of Mt. Fuji, a steep, craggy mountain on the left, and a more gentle hill on the right form a spatial bar- rier behind which the holy mountain rises in reserve against the gray wash of the background. Medieval poems and prose texts by literati monks, bunjinso, often mention Mt. Fuji; in Muromachi period ink painting, however, the theme occurs but rarely. This scroll is the earliest example extant. The scarcity of paintings representing actual land- scapes, so-called "true view pictures", shinkeizu, in Zen-related ink painting can be explained by the tendency in Zen thought to idealize nature. The poetic idyll of the shosaizu, "picture of a [scholar's] studio", praising the ideal of solitary med- itation far from the bustle of the world, could hardly be made to agree with harsh everyday reality, with the immediately inhabited and perceived environment. But not only the subject of this painting is unusual; the "boneless manner", mokkotsu- ho, which the artist used is notable, too. The objects are defined by the contours of ink washes like silhouettes, rinkakusen, and their surface quality is represented by texture strokes, shunpo. This is what dif- ferentiates this style of medieval ink paint- ing from the somewhat younger school of 310 Shubun (active ca.1423-1460) in Kyoto and his successors. Near the left edge of the scroll, immedi- ately above the little hut near the fence, the artist has affixed a seal, in the shape of an archaic Chinese bronze vessel, reading Shinko. Chui'an Shinko was a Zen monk at Seirai'an of Kenchoji in Kamakura. There he occupied the "chief seat", shuso, and was allowed to use the title seido, "West- ern Hall". Thus in the few passages in old sources mentioning Chui'an Shinkb he is referred to as [Shin]Ko seido. He followed the tradition of the influential painter-monk Kichizan Mincho (1351 -1431) at Tofukuji in Kyoto, and was the teacher of Kenko Shokei (active ca.1478-1506/1518). He is considered the founder of the Kamakura school of ink painting (Figs. 18 and 126). H.K.</page><page sequence="303">M.

Inscription by Kbshi Eho (died ca.1465), around 1460. Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 121.5 x 34.7 cm. Agency for Cultural Affairs, Bunkachb, Tokyo. Important Cultural Property, JOyd Bunkazai. In his "Small View of Lake and Mountain", the artist directs the viewer's attention immediately to the elegant estate, yashiki, in the right foreground surrounded by plum trees and bamboo. The airy, bright buildings of the summer residence, azuma- ya, with their lightly curved, flat-tiled roofs are built on a spit of land projecting into the lake, and connected with the left shore by a sturdy wooden bridge. On the left, a steep, rugged rock with slender pines and gnarled leaf trees rises. Behind the rock, a path leads toward the bridge. A wanderer with his small servant is on the way to the villa by the water, to visit the two scholars immersed in conversation. Behind a stony island in the foreground, two boats are secured with crossed poles. On a small plateau on the right beside the large rock, there is an open vista pavilion. A solitary man inside enjoys the view over the lake and the waterfall plunging into the valley beyond a mist-shrouded gorge. On the other side of the lake, sand banks, suna- hama, with sparse vegetation project into the lake. There, boats are anchored, fish- ing nets are hung for drying, and a few water birds have descended. In the dis- tance, steep mountains rise one behind the other from flat spits of land. Two sail- ing boats are returning to a nearby fishing village. Thanks to its well-balanced, open compo- sition and the empty space between the painting and the inscription, this "Small View of Lake and Mountain" emanates unfettered breadth and depth. Unlike the landscapes of the Shubun school with their high, distant mountains, kb'en sansui, this painting emphasizes the horizontal element in the foreground, thus decisively enhancing the effect of a deep spatial recession. 312 On the lower right edge, the artist identi- fies himself with a seal reading Ten'yu. Unfortunately, we know hardly anything about this artist. A Hotei painting at the Kosetsu Bijutsukan in Kobe bears the same seal, together with one reading Shokei. The Shokei seal in turn appears on stylistically related landscape paintings at the Umezawa Kinenkan, Tokyo, and in the Kimiko and John Powers Collection. Evidently, Shokei Ten'yu was a painter active around the middle of the fifteenth century who wanted to maintain a clear distance from the Shubun tradition with its poetic "landscapes on scrolls with poems and painting", shigajiku sansui. He tried to structure the surface of the painting clearly and distinctly, and thus suggest space. In this, he was influenced by the atmospheric, evocative landscapes of the Chinese artist Ma Lin (active around 1216-1255). For his architectural repre- sentations, he used the "ruled-line paint- ing" technique, jiehua in Chinese and kaiga in Japanese, of painters such as Sun Junze (active first half of 14th cen- tury), as well as other stylistic elements of the Southern Song academic tradition. The Zen master Kbshi Eho, who wrote the long inscription, was a close friend of the painter-monk Sesshu Toyo (1420-1506). In 1419, Eho entered Tofukuji in Kybto, where he studied under Kiyo Hoshu (1361 -1424). From 1432 until 1436, he travelled in China, visiting the important traditional meditation centres west of Hangzhou. In the inscription of the "Small View of Lake and Mountain", he eulogizes the historical past of this region, mention- ing the poets Lin Bu (967-1028) and Su Shi (Dongpo, 1036-1101), both of whom lived near West Lake. There, Eho still found evidence of their former presence during his wanderings. Evidently, Ten'yu 's landscape painting reminded the Zen monk - having travelled far - of past days in Ming China. Koshi Eho died in 1664 or 1665, thus providing a firm terminus ante quem for the date of this work. H.K./H.B.</page><page sequence="305">1.L,14 g#~~~~~~~~~m1 IN . r ~~~~~It' P.~~~~~~~~~~.t M.

Inscriptions by ShitsG Shuryb (before 1458-after 1487), and Ryo'an Keigo (1425-1514). Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 89.5 x 37.5 cm. Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, Osaka. Important Cultural Property, Juyo Bunkazai. In the shadow of a steeply rising, craggy boulder with two pine trees leaning to the left, an open, straw-thatched vista pavilion stands at the shore of a mist-shrouded river. Near the open window, a man is seated, presumably enjoying the fra- grance and the sight of the first plum blos- soms on his estate. He is expecting a vis- itor on this spring day. On the bridge over a mountain brook plunging down the rocks on the right, a guest with his lug- gage carrier is approaching. Behind him in the distance, the roofs of a monastery emerge from the mist at the foot of a bizarre, sparsely wooded rocky peak with a waterfall. In midground, a shore path leads toward far-away mountains and woods on the right. The type of "scroll of a [scholar's] studio with poems and painting", shosai shiga- jiku, reached its peak around the time of Shubun (active ca.1423-1460). When this apex was passed in the second half of the fifteenth century, artists still continued to eulogize life in the seclusion of nature; but one can discern a development away from pure poetic expression and toward a stronger optical, structural precision. This tendency can also be seen in the brush- work and the perfection of the technical means. The painter Gaku'o Zokyui belongs to the generation of painters following Shuibun, together with luminaries such as Sesshu Toyo (1420-1506), Shbkei Ten'yu (active ca. 1440-1460), and Oguri Sotan (1431- 1481). Although Gaku'o's landscapes are composed in accordance with the prin- ciples developed by the Shubun school, i.e., with high, distant mountains, kd'en sansui, he always renders the carefully integrated elements of his sceneries with objective clarity and freshness. For this, he uses wet, carefully graded and con- 314 trasting ink washes, boku'un, as well as vigorous structural brushstrokes, shunpd. The result is not only a distinction between near and far in the clearly arranged, over- lapping elements of the painting, but also a feeling of lucidity and transparency. The concentration of the compact elements in the lower right corner of the composition is loosening with increasing height and distance. The weight of the composition lies clearly on the right side of the scroll, with a certain diagonal pull from the lower left corner. We know hardly anything about Gaku'o ZOkyu. A number of paintings bearing his square name seal Gaku'0, like the one at the Masaki Museum - near the lower right edge - have inscriptions by Ryb'an Keigo (1425-1514), with whom Gaku'o seems to have been in close contact. Ryo'an Keigo, a highly esteemed literatus monk and 171st abbot of Tofukuji, came from the province of Ise, modern Mie Prefecture, and it has been conjectured that Gaku'b also might be from there. Poems and prose texts on paintings show that Ryo'an Keigo was also a friend of Sesshut ToyO; most likely, Gaku'o was therefore active in the great gozan monasteries of the capital at the time of Sesshu. Stylistically related with the scroll at the Masaki Bijutsukan are the landscape paintings by Gaku'o at the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; the scroll at the Hatakeyama Kinenkan, TOkyo, with an inscription by the Shbkokuji and Nanzenji abbot Osen Keisan (1429-1493); and one at the Tokyo National Museum with a poetic colophon in traditional meter by Ten'in (Moku'un) Ryuttaku (1422-1500), the 218th Kenninji abbot and 231th Nanzenji prelate. Gaku'o also turned to the theme of the "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang", Shdsho hakkei. In his four-line "regulated seven-character poem", shichigon zekku, in the upper left of the Masaki scroll, Ryo'an Keigo refers to the scenery of the painting and its atmosphere: a quiet spring day on which a visitor crosses the bridge to approach the pavilion, where his host is expecting him. Keigo signed his verse Isen Yashaku, "Isen, the priest from the countryside". The colophon on the right is by Shitsut Shuryo, also from Ise and appointed 236th abbot of Nanzenji in 1487. He used the epithet Unkanshi, "Master of the Cloud Interval", shown in the upper impression of the two seals. The "old cassock Tosai", rdnd Tdsai, as Shitsut Shuryo signs himself here, strikes a similar note in his inscrip- tion, saying that in the pavilion by the river under the waterfall, "poems are going to be recited until the setting sun would reach the plum trees again".

Inscriptions by Osen Keisan (1429-1493), Getto Shukyo (before 1480-1500), and Ranpa Keishi (1409-1501). Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 105.8 x 30.3 cm. Nezu Bijutsukan, Tokyo. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. The three inscriptions in the upper part of the scroll are by esteemed Zen masters in Kybto. The first two lines on the right are by Gettb Shukyb, 225th abbot of Nanzenji; his immediate successor in that position, Ranpa Keishi added the eulogy in the mid- dle; and the 239th Nanzenji abbot and 79th Shbkokuji prelate Osen Keisan con- tributed a lengthy commentary on the left side of the scroll. Keisan records in his colophon that Geiami painted the scroll for his disciple Kenkb Shbkei (active around 1478-1506/1518). Shbkei had gone from Kamakura to Kybto in 1478 to further his religious studies in the celebrated gozan monasteries of the capital; to get acquain- ted with the important art collections of Kybto; and to deepen his education as painter. When Shbkei was about to return to Kamakura after three years in Kybto, this painting was given to him as a kind of "competence seal", inkajo. Such certifi- cates confirmed that the Zen adept had fulfilled all conditions for the tasks of a Zen master, and that he was entitled to pre- serve and transmit the doctrine. At the same time, the scroll was a farewell pre- sent, sibetsuzu, for Kenkb Shbkei. In his inscription, Osen Keisan reverentially calls the painter Geiami Kokushu Geia, "National Hand Geia[mi]". The painter signed and dated his work at the lower left edge: "[By] Gakusb Shingei aged 50 [i.e., 49 in Western calculation]", and added his seal Gakus5, the "Studying Oldster". Thus the painting can be dated to 1480, when Geiami, five years before his early death, was at the peak of his artistic powers. The members of a family with the word Ami in their name were active in the most diverse artistic fields. Ami is an abbreviation of Amida, indicating a close connection with the "Pure Land School" which especially reveres the Buddha Amida. Nbami (1397- 1471) was the father of Geiami, who in turn 316 was the father of Sbami (died 1525). All three served their respective Shbgun as artistic consultants, dcbishO. They were connoisseurs and assumed the tasks of what today would be called curators of the voluminous, invaluable Ashikaga collec- tions. Their main duties in this capacity were the appraisal and evaluation of imported art treasures and of new acqui- sitions. At the same time, however, the "Three Ami", San Ami, had great success as talented, independent ink painters. They created a loose, soft, suggestive style of painting, free from the conven- tional ideas of Zen painting. This new style, contrary to the idealized phantasy world of the "scrolls with poems and painting", shigajiku, tended toward a real- istic rendering of actually existing and experienced landscapes. Although the scroll painted for Kenkb Shbkei still depicts the subject of retired life in the seclusion of picturesque moun- tains, such as do the shigajiku, this land- scape has largely lost any idyllic character and poetic enchantment. The rocks of the bizarre grotto in which the hermitage stands, are harsh and inhospitable. From above, a waterfall cuts vertically through the rock, roaring close by the hermitage into the foaming mountain brook. Two pine trees cling precariously to the rock on the left. The straw-thatched pavilion, the bridge in the foreground, and the pine tree leaning toward the right provide counter- points to the overall vertical direction of the composition; at the same time, they form a closed, rounded spatial area. A monk with his servant crosses the bridge on his way to his empty hermitage. In the valley high above the grotto, the mountain stream that feeds the waterfall can barely be seen. Clouds of mist move diagonally toward the mountains, enshrouding them completely above the upper valley. The recipient of the painting, Kenkb Shbkei, was secretary or scribe, shoki, at Kenchbji in Kamakura. He is therefore also known as Kei Shoki. Thanks to his training in the capital, he became an important fig- ure in the development of ink painting in Kamakura, which was still considered to be lagging behind Kybto in matters of art.

Ink on paper. 82.9 x 152.8 cm. Tbfukuji, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, JOy6 Bunkazai. Cf. No. 17. The large view shows Tofukuji in Kyoto from the west, in front of the "East Moun- tains", Higashiyama. To the present day, this important Zen monastery of the Rinzai school looks almost the way it did around 1500. The white-chalked, tile-roofed wall in the west divides the painting horizon- tally. Along this horizontal central axis, the buildings aligned from north toward south, i.e., from right to left, can be seen: the two-storey sanmon or "Triple Gate", also called "Mountain Gate"; the "Dharma Hall", hattb, which was not rebuilt after a fire in December of 1881; the "Buddha Hall", butsuden, or hondb, "Main Hall", and the abbot's residence, hdjo. From the Abbot's Quarters, a corridor-like, roofed bridge, tsutenkyb - erected in 1380 - leads across a gorge with a brook, thus connecting the nucleus of the monastery with the "Hall of the Mountain Opener", kaisandb, and the Fumon'in. In the foreground, several tatchu, cloisters or hermitages, complete the view. Although this work clearly emphasizes the depicted buildings and structures, it nev- ertheless differs from a technical, archi- tectural plan showing the monastery, garan haichi zu. Rather, the painting is a truly harmonious composition in the tradition of medieval Japanese landscape painting, which, of course, always included archi- tectural elements. This is particularly evi- dent in the carefully rendered background mountains, depicted in soft ink washes, the meticulously delineated trees and bamboo clusters, and the skillful integra- tion of judiciously dispersed human fig- ures into the composition. On a separate strip of paper above the painting, Ryo 'an Keigo (1425-1514), a pro- minent poet-monk and 171st abbot of Tofukuji, wrote the "Record of the TOfukuji Precinct", Tofukuji garan ki, dated to 1505. 318 Thus it is safe to assume that the painting dates to about the same time. In 1510, the already eighty-five year old Ryb'an Keigo took part in a diplomatic mission to Ming China, from which he returned three years later. Since he was a friend of Sesshut Toyo (1420-1506), and since he wrote colo- phons for other works by the celebrated painter-monk, Sesshui has traditionally been considered as the painter of this magnificent view of TOfukuji. Although the style is basically in the tradition of the Sesshui school, however, the painting is somewhat too stiff and hard for a work by the great master. Perhaps it is the work of a close disciple. H.K.

Hanging scroll. Ink and light colours on paper. 22.4 x 31.4 cm. Nomura Bijutsukan, Kybto. Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai. Cf. Nos. 50, 51, and 61. This magnificent little seascape with its Sesson seal in the upper left is perhaps the most famous painting by Sesson Shtkei. It shows a solitary boat with swollen sail caught by the storm and lashed through the turbulent water at a distance from the shore. In the foreground on the left, a straw-thatched cottage, tomaya, is hidden in a bamboo grove on a rocky promontory. The bamboo in the background is shrouded in wet curtains of rain, while the bamboo in the foreground with its dishevelled leaves is bent to the left under the force of the wind. A strong tree in the foreground defies the raging storm which has swept away all its leaves. In the lower right, foaming waves are hurled against the rocky shore. A feeling of solitude emanates from the small boat in the water, but it also seems to be bursting with strength. Lying deep in the water, the boat with its solid, jet-black contour lines suggests impregnable steadfastness. With taut ropes, the whitish sail catches the wind and rain gales rendered by Sesson with alternating lighter and darker washes. Around the boat, fine, curving lines indicate the movement of the agi- tated water surface. Sesson's objective in this painting was to capture atmospheric effects, such as the mood of the storm and the changing light, to make visible the vibrating mainspring of the cosmic forces. It seems that he wanted to contrast uncompromising power of resistance - in the old tree and the boat - with the dynamic movement of the ele- ments - the raging waters and the tem- pestuous wind. The painting is imbued with an inner mon- umentality and dramatic energy which inti- mate deeper dimensions. Just as the boat and its crew are on their own in their strug- gle with the elements, so the Zen monk 320 has to find his way alone in the midst of the change and danger of this rough world, before suddenly breaking through to enlightenment at the right moment. Earlier Zen painters had mainly tried to depict the ideal of a secluded, enchanted world of harmony and grace in their land- scapes. In this painting by Sesson, how- ever, a completely different tendency can be seen. Sesson seems to impart the tribulations of his own heart into the paint- ing, and at the same time to show the rough reality of life as he had lived it. Individuality and character of the artist reveal themselves almost fatefully in this painting: it is said that Sesson, born into a warrior clan in the north-east Kantb region, was deeply hurt when his father disinherited him, giving preference to an illegitimate son. Frustrated, Sesson seems to have entered a Zen monastery at a young age and found his peace there. Apart from a few restless wandering years, the unconventional painter-monk spent his whole life in his native region.

Handscroll. Ink on paper. 24.5 x 662.5 cm. Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, Osaka. Cf. Nos. 50, 51, and 60. The confluence of the rivers Xiao and Xiang lies in the south of Hunan Province near Lingling. The Xiang Jiang originates in today's Guangxi Province, flows north past Hunan's capital Changsha, and finally, after absorbing many tributary rivers, it streams into Lake Dongting in northern Hunan Province. The region of Xiao and Xiang is a wet river landscape with abundant hills in the south and a flat marsh basin in the north. It has tradition- ally been associated with secluded calm places and with a contemplative, solitary life in nature. Moreover, the enchantment of these "landscapes of the mind" was enhanced by historical events and old lit- erary and artistic traditions that originated here. The "Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang" were one of the favourite subjects of medieval Japanese Zen painter-monks. In China, the scenic beauty of the two rivers had been praised by poets and painters since the eleventh century. Song Di (ca. 1015- 1080) seems to have been the first to cre- ate a series of paintings of the theme, and the statesman and literatus Shen Gua (1031 -1095) recorded their titles. In this order, changed again and again in the course of time, the titles of the "Eight Views" - not topographical depictions of specific places, but paintings of poetic moods - are as follows: Wild Geese Descending to Sandbar, heisa rakugan Returning Sails off Distant Shore, enpo kihan Mountain Market, Clear with Rising Mist, sanshi seiran River and Sky in Evening Snow, koten bosetsu Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting, Dotei shucgetsu 322 Night Rain on Xiao and Xiang, Shosho ya'u Evening Bell from Mist-shrouded Temple, enji bansho Fishing Village in Evening Glow, gyoson sekishb During the second half of the fourteenth century, the first versions of this subject came to Japan. Painted by the thirteenth century monks Muqi and Yujian, these scrolls were highly esteemed in the collec- tions of the Ashikaga Shoguns and in the Hojo family collection. These works were painted in a wet style using no contour lines, in the so-called "boneless manner", mokkotsuhb, a style especially popular in the Jiangnan region. This mode of finely graded ink washes, in connection with the changing light, often represented by the empty paper or silk, creates convincing spatial depth and attractive atmospheric effects of light and dark. To the innovative spirit of the painter-monk Sesson, such landscape paintings must have been fascinating. It is probably safe to assume that he saw original works by the Southern Song masters. It is known that he copied a scroll by Muqi and an- other one by Yujian. The handscroll of the Masaki Bijutsukan bears the following revealing signature at the end: "Picture of the 'Eight Views' after a scroll by Yujian, by the brush of the old Sesson", accompa- nied by two seals reading Sesson and a third one with the characters Shukei. What intrigued Sesson about his model was not so much the scenic and psycho- logical mood elicited by the alternating set of poems and paintings still extant in Yujian's celebrated three fragments of a handscroll of the "Eight Views". Rather, it was the abbreviating, contrast-rich lan- guage of the brush, the strong effects of light and shadow, as well as the light and dark contrasts of the ink. The wet, rapidly applied ink wash typical of Yujian and the sudden changes from empty ground or light ink to jet-black ink puddles are used by Sesson for a highly personal "ink play", bokugi, which can draw the viewer into an almost meditational immersion. He lends his softly applied lines and washes their own dynamics which do not take into account perceptability of space or of sur- face textures; instead, Sesson offers the viewer an agreeable rhythmical up and down among misty mountain ranges and hills covered with bristly, scratchy vegeta- tion, a movement that reveals itself only by the continuous unrolling of the scroll. Like many other Japanese artists painting the theme, Sesson seems to have taken into consideration the seasonal change to a certain extent; the titles of the series appear therefore in the following order in his scroll: Mountain Market, Clear with Rising Mist Wild Geese Descending to Sandbar Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting Night Rain over Xiao and Xiang Evening Bell from Mist-shrouded Temple Returning Sails off Distant Shore Fishing Village in Evening Glow River and Sky in Evening Snow H.K./F.L.</page><page sequence="315">.. ........

Masaki Bijutsukan, Tadaoka, Osaka. The abbreviating painting style of the thir- teenth-century painter-monk Yujian was enthusiastically received in Japan as early as the fifteenth century, and with Tbshun's teacher Sesshui Toyb (1420-1506) it reached its first peak. The wet, often broad, rapidly applied brushstrokes typi- cal of SesshO and his school can also be found in Tdshun's 'Eight Views", the only version of this theme in the Yujian manner by a disciple of Sesshui to have come down to us in its entirety. But unlike Sesshu, whose landscapes always retain a structural, linear character, Toshun fur- ther develops the Yujian style to express atmospheric effects and painterly moods. He reduces the views entirely to the ele- ments given in the titles and moves them unusually close to the viewer. Delicately graded washes evoke the colours of nature with the most subtle nuances. In many places, clear brushstrokes are avoided in favour of overlapping and freely flowing washes, making the term hatsu- boku, "splashed ink", especially apt for Tbshun's painting technique. Unexpectedly and to all outward appear- ances accidentally, the various landscape elements of these views emerge from the mist and fog. Roofs looming from the mist mark striking linear accents and give the atmospheric nature scenes concrete di- mensions. In accordance with the poetic titles ar- ranged in pairs of opposites, we find on four of the views distant, steep mountains, and on the four others flat, nearby shore scenes. In the views of complete moun- tains, Tbshun uses their vast panorama to render dramatic atmospherical effects; he contrasts these views with calmer depic- tions of a more detailed and accessible nature in the paintings of the flat vistas. 326 Tbshun's paintings were originally bound as an album of eight leaves. Later, they were joined in a handscroll, and only in recent times were they mounted as eight hanging scrolls. The original order of the leaves is therefore not known, and we cannot say whether the eight leaves were originally arranged in contrasting pairs. They are illustrated here in the traditional order after Shen Gua (1031 -1095). Com- paring Tbshun's views with the extant ones by Yujian, the sensuality directly in- spired by nature with which Tbshun pre- sents the literary Song theme is most striking. In contrast, Yujian's paintings emanate an almost intellectual aloofness. Perhaps this comparison confirms the suggestion found in the informal "Com- ments of [Hasegawa] Tbhaku [1 539-161 0] on Painting", Tbhaku gasetsu, that Tbshun was the son and apprentice of a carpen- ter at Tbdaiji in Nara, and that he was dis- covered by Sesshc. This source tells us also that Toshun accompanied his master SesshO on a journey to the province of Kaga, present-day Ishikawa Prefecture, and that he stayed there for three years. Around 1501, the two artists went on to Noto. During this time, Toshun seems to have been under the patronage of Hosokawa Shigeyuki (1434-151 1), the gov- ernor of the provinces of Sanuki and Awa on Shikoku. Shigeyuki is also said to have advised Tbshun not to follow his ingenious paragon too slavishly. After Sesshc's death in 1506, Tbshun was called back to Kybto in order to participate in the artistic decoration of Ryugen'in, a cloister at Daitokuji built under the patronage of the Hatakeyama family who resided in Noto. The work at Ryugen'in was finished in 1506. Around 1512 Toshun is further thought to have painted, upon the commission of Ouchi Yoshioki (1477-1528), ruler over the province of Suo in modern Yamaguchi Prefecture, a series of small paintings with Chinese figures as well as birds and flow- ers. Keijo Shu-rin (1440-1518), the gozan poet and 83rd abbot of Shbkokuji, wrote short poems for the set shortly afterwards. The poems are also recorded in the Kanrin koroshu, his chronologically arranged "Reed and Calabash Anthology from the Forest of Brushes", consisting of seven- teen volumes. This provides a secure point of reference for the dating of the painting and poem set, which is now mounted on two six-fold screens. Yoshioki was the eldest son of Ouchi Masahiro (died 1495), the patron of SesshuW Between 1520 and 1525, Tbshun - now advanced from carpenter's apprentice to esteemed painter - met the twelfth Ashikaga Shogun Yoshiharu (1511-1550, reigned 1521-1546), who asked him for three fan paintings. Toshun, however, he- sitated and gave as excuse the lack of any good models at hand. Hearing this, the famous Sbami (died 1525), keeper of the shbgunal collection or dobbshu, is said to have put fifty paintings from the Ashikaga Collection at his disposal, and Toshun selected a work by the Song master Xia Gui (active ca. 1180-1224) for his fan paintings.

Kyoto National Museum, Important Cultural Property, Juy6 Bunkazai, Located west of the modern provincial cap- ital Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, pic- turesque Xihu is surrounded on three sides by gentle hills. The lake measures 5.6 square kilometers, has four islands, and is divided by two dams which are both named after their purported builders who were famous poets. Baidi, which connects the north-east shore with the largest of the islands, Gushandao, is said to have been constructed by Bai Juyi (772-846) in his capacity as governor of that area in 821, and Su Shi (Dongpo, 1036-1101) was in charge of the construction of the other dam during his term as government official between 1089 and 1091. Sudi runs from the north to the south shore of West Lake and is embell- ished by six gracefully arched bridges which allow people to cross the dam on foot. Many Japanese Zen monks travelling to China for their studies probably landed in the bay of Hangzhou to reach the nearby, renowned meditation centres such as Ling- yinsi on Beishan, Jingcisi on Nanshan, or Wanshousi on Jingshan. They were enchan- ted by the beauty of this lovely mountain and lake scenery, and sang its praise in numer- ous poems and prose texts. In medieval Japan, Xihu became so famous and popu- lar that even painters who knew about the lake only from hearsay included the subject in their works. Beside the 'Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang", Shosho hakkeh West Lake became one of the favourite subjects of Japanese ink painting based on actual Chinese landscapes. In contrast to the Shosho hakkei, however, paintings of Xihu were not concerned with evoking a poetic mood, but endeavored to depict the topo- graphical reality of an actual place. The pair of screens at the Kyoto National Museum is composed as a continuous vista across both screens, giving an astonishingly exact depiction of the geographical situa- 332 tion. The painter invites the viewer to look across the lake from the east, having him peer over the western town wall with its tow- ers and the roofs of Hangzhou along the lower edge of the screens. In the right half of the right screen, a path leads into a ravine and most probably onward to the Baochu Pagoda at the top. The path begins at the northwest town gate from where a dam, the Baidi, spans the lake with a camel-back bridge allowing access to the "Lone Mountain Island", Gushandao. On this is- land, the people of Hangzhou enjoy the view of the moon during the festival of autumnal equinox on the 15th day of the eighth month. The festival centers on the pavilion of the "Autumn Moon on the Still Lake", Ping- huqiuyue, a structure purportedly already erected in Tang times. Another pavilion is reminiscent of the Song poet Lin Bu (967- 1028), who is said to have surrounded him- self with plum blossoms and cranes in his hermitage. From the top of the mountain, one has a majestic view across the lake and the town of Hangzhou. The straight, man-made Sudi with its six bridges - it is 2.8 kilometers long - stretches in strictly horizontal alignment across the midground of the two screens, connecting the southern shore of the lake with the northern one. The small, flat island in the right half of the left screen is Santanyinyue, the island of the 'Three Ponds with the Seal Impression of the Moon". In the back- ground, the western mountains of Hang- zhou are depicted, and on top of the two steeply soaring, inaccessible peaks, one can see the Lingyin Monastery on the North Mountain in the right screen, and the Jingci Monastery on the South Mountain in the left one. The Japanese painter must have known the geography of Hangzhou and its surround- ings intimately. The sweeping panorama - it is almost a vedute - is depicted in a spring and winter setting. At the southern end of Xihu on the left screen, the faraway moun- tains are covered with snow. The small fig- ures are placed with utmost economy and astuteness: fishermen in their boats on the lake, and some wanderers and horseback- riders on the dams and paths enliven the scenery. The artist signed his work on the upper left edge of the outermost panel with a surpris- ing statement: "Recorded by Osai in the 'ink spirit', bokushin, of Muqi." He added two of his seals. Although the soft handling of the ink may be vaguely reminiscent of the loose painting style of the great Song master, the artist's remark is to be interpreted above all as homage to one of his great paragons, confirming his artistic tradition in spirit rather than any formal or stylistic affinity. Or is it possible that Osai had indeed a painting of West Lake by Muqi as a prototype for his pair of screens? We do not know. Maybe he had seen Xihu with his own eyes, a possibil- ity that cannot be excluded either. In old sources concerning the history of painting it is recorded that Noami (1397- 1471), the artistic consultant, dbbdshu, of the eighth Ashikaga Shbgun Yoshimasa (1435-1490) and father of Geiami (1431- 1485), was known, among other names, as "Shun Osai". For this reason, it has been thought possible that he may have painted these screens. However, there is no other convincing basis for such an identification. All that can be said with certainty at the pre- sent time is that the work belongs to the early examples in which an artist employed the monochrome ink mode for representa- tive screens, a technique that came to be used for larger formats by the second half of the fifteenth century.
