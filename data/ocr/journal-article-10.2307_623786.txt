<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die nicht menschengestaltigen Gdtter der Griechen. By M. W. DE VISSER. Pp. x+272. Leyden: E. J. Brill, 1903. 5 m. Dr. de Visser holds that the mainspring of all worship of stocks, stones, trees, and animals is the belief that they have souls, or at least are indwelt by spirits. Symbolism, in his view, played no part in primitive religioii, the key to which must be sought in the study of existing savage custom and myth. But in order to compare with these the dark origins of Hellenic religion, we must set out with a thorough examination and classification of the vestiges of non-anthropomorphic worships which it retained. This task is admirably performed in the present work. The immense mass of sources, literary and artistic, is exhibited under the main headings of Stone, Stock, Tree, and Animal Cults, each of which is subdivided according to four carefully defined stages in the ' freeing' of the numen from the material object, a process which corresponded with the growth of anthropomnorphism. For purposes of reference, these ' categories' are excellently chosen, but as regards the later stages, we may doubt whether many of the examples given are really survivals; whether Hermes Kriophoros, for instance, was ever a ram, or Athena Hippia a horse. The author has not of course attempted to solve the manifold problems connected with his subject-matter; on several points he originates or quotes illuminating comments, but save as a warning, we could dispense with the notices of dead and dying hypotheses which he has prefixed to his treasury of facts. Four indices, two being typograph ical, and a bibliography of modern authorities, complete the usefulness of the wolrk.</page></plain_text>
