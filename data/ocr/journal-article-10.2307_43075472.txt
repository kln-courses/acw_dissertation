V-VI) Jánoš Makkay Rarely are objects which can be confidently identified with archaeo- logical artefact types or individual finds mentioned in cuneiform texts. In the following we discuss some Hittite-extra-Mesopotamian archaeological finds which can be correlated with various texts in the hope that it will promote a better understanding and interpretation of both artefacts and texts. Obviously, the present state of research does not always enable us to assign a precise correspondence between time, territory and people. (1) An omen text from Sultantepe1 speaks of the golden face of a god('s statue): summa zīm ķurā$i sa ili arķiš ušanmir ķantiš imât. K. Deller2 translates and comments it as follows: "'wenn jemand die golde- nen Gesichtszüge des Gottesbildes schnell (hastig? übereilt?) leuchtend sein lässt, wird er demnächst sterben.' Die Gesichtszüge des Gottesbildes wa- ren also in Gold modelliert, das Bild trug eine goldene Gesichtsmaske, die natürlich aufleuchtete, sobald man eine Lichtquelle auf sie richtete." No statue of an Assyrian deity wearing a golden mask hat yet been found. An Early Bronze Age small statuette, however, probably found at a site called Hasanoģlan near Ankara in Central Anatolia3 corresponds perfectly to Deller's interpretation of the omen text from Sultantepe.

It was prob- ably found in a grave, but it has to be considered a stray find.</page><page sequence="2">70 Jánoš Makkay body of the 25 cm high statuette which in BittePs opinion depicts a fertil- ity goddess, was fashioned from silver; the mask covering its head and neck, also the bands crossing the chest between the breasts and the anklets were of gold (plé V). It is contemporary with the finds from the royal burials of Alaca Höyük and Horoz tepe, and can accordingly be dated between 2300 and 2100 b.c. Insofar as there existed small or life-size statues of Assyrian gods wearing golden masks they might have been sim- ilar to this statuette. The long chronological gap between the Anatolian Early Bronze Age and the Neo-Assyrian period can partly be bridged by a Hittite text4: (Stadt) Lapana: Ijaja, das Götterbild (ist) die Statuette einer Frau aus Holz, sitzend, "verschleiert", von 1 [Kleinelle], ihr Kopf goldbelegt, der Körper aber bleibelegt (Stadt) Tiura: Ijaja, das Götterbild (ist) die Statuette einer Frau aus Holz, silberbelegt, sitzend, "verschleiert",... In H. G. Güterbock's interpretation " sind zwei Städte behandelt, Lapa- na und Tiura, aber in jeder von ihnen nur eine Gottheit, und zwar in beiden dieselbe Göttin Ijaja. An beiden Orten ist sie als sitzende Frau aus Holz von einer Spanne Höhe mit der erwähnten Tracht dargestellt. In Lapana ist der Kopf mit Gold überzogen,. . . in Tiura ist die ganze Figur aus Holz, mit Silber überzogen"5. He also quotes other Hittite texts which mention statues of gods covered with gold or silver6. The prayer of Puduhepa in which she vows to make for the goddess Lelwanis "a sil- ver statue of Hattusili as tall as Hattusili himself, with its head, its hands (and) his feet of gold" is also wellknown7. These Hittite sources confirm the assumption that the lavish burials of Central Anatolia dated to the close of the Early Bronze Age (Alaca Höyük, Horoz tepe, Hasanoglan, Oymaagaç and Göller in the Çorum region8) can be associated with an Indo-European/early Hittite nobility. The Russian Primary Chronicle of Nestor must also be mentioned in this Indo-European context since it reports that in 980 a.D. Prince Vladimir set up six idols on the hill behind his towered courts, amongst them a wooden statue of the Sky-god Perun, 4L.

P. Friedrich recently sug- gested that the various Slavic, Lithuanian and other Indo-European vari- ants of Perun's name link eastward to Indie and westward to Celtic and Baltic, and presumably descend from a very early Indo-European forma- tion (among others perunaš in Hittite)10. The golden bands which cross the chest between the breasts on the body of the Hasanoģlan statuette were an attribute of the Great Goddess from the al-řUbaid period to the Hellenistic Age, and in the prehistoric11 cultures of the Ancient Near East and South-East Europe. (2) A text from Boghazköy12 mentions a golden statuette portraying a standing man (perhaps the male personification of Ishtar, "die männliche Erscheinungsform der Göttin") holding a golden axe - i.e. an axe-termi- nated gold sceptre - in his right hand: Ištar (Šauška) des "Rufens", Statuette aus Gold, stehender Mann, aus dem Schulterblatt Flügel kommend; in der rechten Hand hält er eine Axt aus Gold; in der linken Hand hält er das " Heil"(symbol) aus Gold; auf einem Löwen-Schwanz silberbelegt, seine Brust goldbelegt - steht er. Güterbock compared male figure 38 of the Yazilikaya reliefs to this deity, even though the former does not hold an axe in his hand; however, an axe-headed sceptre can be seen on a Late Hittite relief from Malatya-Ars- lantepe13. The form of the sceptre-head depicted on another Late Hittite relief carried to Babylon from Sam'al (Zincirli) practically matches prehis- toric stone axes; this relief shows the younger weather god holding an axe in his right hand, and a three-pronged lightning fork in his left14. The royal burials of Alaca Höyük shed some light on the origins of the sceptres wielded by Hittite deities and very probably also by kings. 9 L. A. Dmitrieva - D. S.

Even better analogies can be quoted from among the power symbols recovered from the male burials and cenotaphs of the rich Late Neolithic cemetery excavated near Varna in Bulgaria which is more or less contemporary with the Alaca Höyük burials (and other rich hoards of Northwest Anatolia). Grave 4 (a cenotaph) yielded a 18,5 cm long gold-mounted stone axe, the shaft of which was also covered with gold mounts16. A sceptre of pure gold with gold-mounted shaft (pl. VI) was found in grave 36 (a cenotaph, containing among other things gold anthropomorphic pendants17). Two other sceptres of which the tip is an Early Bronze Age type copper axe, and which have gold-mounted shafts, have also been reported from other graves of this cemetery18. The golden axe of the Hittite text most probably functioned as a sceptre which since the Early Bronze Age was the power symbol of Ana- tolian sovereigns and also of the Hittite kings who inherited it directly from rulers buried at places like Alaca Höyük. The numerous links be- tween the Varna cemetery and Alaca Höyük would suggest that both dy- nasties can be associated with Indo-Europeans who were related parts of the populations inhabiting the Circumpontic area, the material culture of which, however, began to differ considerably by the second half of the third millennium b.c. (as indicated by the more "primitive" nature of Varna). A detailed discussion of this issue would, however, exceed the scope of this short study. (3) Güterbock also discussed an artefact denoted as giš.tukul, "ein Gegenstand, der mit Sonnenscheiben und Mondsicheln geschmückt ist und 'auf dem sich ein 'Bild' eines Mannes befindet. Das Ideogramm steht für 'Waffe' im allgemeinen; als Bezeichnung einer bestimmten Waffenart nimmt man allgemein 'Keule, Streitkolben ' an"19. He alludes to a Hittite ceremonial axe which also depicts the relief of a deity alongside other fig- ures20; however, he rejects the translation of the expression as "Axt" or 15 H. Z.

It could well be that this cultic object or power symbol can be identified with the ceremonial spear- heads excavated in the Ikiztepe I cemetery, dated to the Early Bronze Age II-III periods and thus contemporaneous with the royal graves of Alaca Höyiik. B. Alkim also noted numerous similarities between this cemetery and the finds from Alaca (among others the human figures fashioned from gold sheet). A male and a female figure can be seen on either side of both ceremonial spearheads standing under a sun disc; in Alkim's opinion they represent a divine couple21. No matter what the meaning of giš. tukul may be, these lavishly ornamented spearheads from Ikiztepe I cor- respond to the artefact denoted by this term much better than the early Mesopotamian analogies quoted by Alkim. It is an entirely different mat- ter that the custom of decorating ceremonial weapons and similar artefacts can perhaps be traced back to Mesopotamia.
