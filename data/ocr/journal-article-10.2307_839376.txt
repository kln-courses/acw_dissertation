<plain_text><page sequence="1">OPERATING DEFECTIVE AUTOMOBILES: THE FRENCH CODE AND ITS NORTH AMERICAN COUSINS John G. Fleming* Experience has shown that certain provisions of the Napoleonic Code, like some French wines, do not fare well in Atlantic crossings. Notorious is art. 1384 whose first paragraph purports to impose re- sponsibility for damage caused not only by one's own conduct (fait) but also that of persons for whom one is answerable or of things in one's care.' Following a list of the former group (parents, artisans, masters and employers) comes an "exculpatory clause" allowing parents and artisans to escape on proof that they could not have avoided the accident. This exculpatory clause was to become the fulcrum of the whole article's destiny.2 Since it only applied in terms to parents and arti- sans, what was to be the basis of liability in the other instances cov- ered by art. 1384? As is well known, during most of the Code's first century of exegesis, the view prevailed that the first paragraph was merely an elaboration of the fault principle enunciated in arts. 1382- 3, and it was not until, under the pressure of changing social and eco- nomic conditions associated with industrialization and urbanization,3 that the courts eventually breathed life into the provision4 by constru- * Editor-in-Chief. 1. On est responsable, non-seulement du dommage que l'on cause par son propre fait, mais encore de celui qui est cause par le fait des personnes dont on doit repondre, ou des choses que l'on a sous sa garde. Le pere, et la mere apres le deces du mari, sont responsables du dommage cause par leurs enfans mineurs habitant avec eux; Les maltres et les commettans, du dommage cause par leurs domestiques et prepos6s dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employes; Les instituteurs et les artisans, du dommage cause par leurs 6leves et apprentis pendant le temps qu'ils sont sous leur surveillance. La responsabilite ci-dessus a lieu, a moins que les pere et mere, institut- eurs et artisans, ne prouvent qu'ils n'ont pu empecher le fait qui donne lieu a cette responsabilit6. 2.

Their most egregious spokesmen were the jurists Josserand and Saleil- les. 4. The landmark decision, arret Teffaine, gave recovery to an employee injured by a boiler explosion on a boat against the owner, though the cause of the explosion was unknown. It is commonly thought that the decision was influenced by a desire to help workmen injured in industrial accidents prior to the passage of workmen's compensation which did not take place until the 513</page><page sequence="2">514 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 23 ing the gardien's responsibility for things as an independent source of liability which was strict and avoidable only by force majeure or cas fortuit.5 T'his important judicial orientation equipped French law to cope, at least for some time to come,6 with the increasing problem of automobile accidents by imposing near-strict liability on operators of defective cars7 as well as eventually for accidents due to the manner of driving.8 How different was to be the fate of the same article in Quebec and Louisiana! The Quebec version9 offers a slight textual variation in that the exculpatory clause purports to cover all "the aforemen- tioned cases" and has therefore long been construed, and quite inde- pendently of the French experience, as extending also to liability for things.10 It thus gave clearer textual authority, as the French version following year, 1897. The decision (Cass. civ. 16 June 1896; 1897.1.433; note Saleilles, S. 1897.1.17) is discussed by Planiol &amp; Ripert, Droit Civile VI, no. 479; Tunc, supra n. 2 at 179; Amos and Walton. supra n. 2 at 203-5. 5.

Though an improvement on the status quo ante, latter-day critics advo- cate much more drastic reform.

The landmark decision was of course Affaire Jand'heur (Cass. cham- bres r6unies, 13 Feb. 1930) Dalloz 1930.1.57 (note by Ripert); Sirey 1930.1.121 (note by Esmein). 9. Art. 1054 of the C.C. of Lower Canada (1866): Elle est responsable non-seulement du dommage qu'elle cause par sa propre faute, mais encore de celui cause par la faute de ceux dont elle a le contr6le, et par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde. Le pere, et apres son d6ces, la mere, sont responsables du dommage cause par leurs eniants mineurs; Les tuteurs sont 6galement responsables pour leurs pupilles; Les curateurs ou autres ayant legalement la garde des insenses, pour le dommage caus6 par ces derniers; L'instituteur et l'artisan, pour le dommage cause par ses eleves ou ap- prentis, pendant qu'ils sont sous sa surveillance; La responsabilit6 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est assujettie ne peut pruver qu'elle n'a pu empecher le fait qui a caus6 le dom- mage; Les maltres et les commettants sont responsables du dommage cause par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans 1'ex6cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ6s. 10. This approach received the imprimatur of the Privy Council in Quebec Railway v. Vandry [1920] A.C. 662 and City of Montreal v. Watt [1922] A.C. 555. See Baudouin, Responsabilit6 Civile Delictuelle (1973) 262 ff.; Crepeau, "Liability for Damage Caused by Things. From the Civil Law Point of View," 40 Can. B. Rev. 222 (1962). The principal cases are collected by Castel, The Civil Law System of the Province of Quebec 448-84 (1962). We need not</page><page sequence="3">1975] COMMENTS 515 could not, to "presumptive liability" for things. But progressive as this interpretation was, over strong ideological as well as legalistic op- position, it suffered a fatal setback as a result of engrafting the quali- fication that the injury be caused by the "autonomous act" of the thing.'1 This anthropomorphic pedantry,'2 long since discarded in France," excluded all traffic accidents in which the automobile was under human control since, in order to qualify, the thing has to be- come dynamic on its own. Thus the enormous potential of the Code article, unlocked by French jurisprudence, remained foreclosed in Lower Canada. A reconvergence between the law of France and Quebec commenced only long afterwards when a special statute in Quebec introduced a regime of presumed liability for owners and driv- ers of motor vehicles,14 without however touching the prevailing con- dwell here on the rather different interpretations, as between France and Quebec, as to what kind of exculpation will suffice. French jurisprudence insists, as we have seen, on proof of an external cause; whereas Quebec, deeply attached to the fault system, in effect allows only a presumption of fault (not liability) interpolating "by reasonable means" into the phrase "unable to prevent the act which caused the damage". See Millner, infra n. 11, 711-16. 11. See M.A. Milliner, "'Autonomous Acts of Things' in Quebec Law-Legal Adventurism versus Legal Conservatism," 17 McGill L.J. 699 (1971); Cr6peau, supra n. 10, at 234-5. See P6russe v. Stafford [1928] S.C.R. 416, 418 (Anglin C.J.); Alain v. Hardy [1951] S.C.R. 540, 549 (Taschereau C.J.). 12. Textually, there was actually less justification for this construction than in France: The Napoleonic Code speaks of "fait des choses", the Quebec Code of "dommage caus6 par les choses." Nadeau, 8, Traite de Droit Civile du Quebec (1949) 382. 13. At any rate after Jand'heur, supra n. 8. In effect, Quebec remained wedded to an interpretation later repudiated in its country of origin. Belgium seems to maintain an intermediate view, by invoking art. 1384 in case of auto- mobile accidents only on proof of equipment failure: 2 Mazeaud et Tunc (supra) no. 1221 n. 1, citing Cass. 26 May 1904 (Pas. I 246) and subsequent jurisprudence constante. A similar position appears to obtain in Mauritius, as reported by Angelo, "The Mauritius Approach to, Article 1384(1) of the French Civil Code," 4 Comp. &amp; Int'l L.J. of S. Afr. 57 (1971). 14. The Highway Victims Indemnity Act (R.S.Q. 1964 c. 232) s. 3. This provision has a wider application than the familiar "pedestrian section" in many of Canada's common law provinces, since it covers not only pedestrians and cyclists but also passengers, including one's own gratuitous passengers ("guests"): Les Heretiers C6te v. Les Heretiers Dickson [1969] B.R. 367. (French law about the same time happened to reach the same conclusion via a different route, viz. by at last giving them the benefit of C.C. art. 1384: Schroeter c. Landru, Cour cass. 20 Dec. 1968, D. 1969. 37; Starek, Droit Civile nos. 220-39 (transport b6n6vole).) On the other hand, the presumptive liability under this statute was held inapplicable to two-car collisions on the ground that the presumptions in favor of each driver cancel out (at least ac- cording to the majority view: Baudouin, supra n. 10, 357-62), whereas in France each driver recovers (in the absence of proof of fault) from the other in full (not just 50%). For the future, a comprehensive no-fault scheme of indemnification for all automobile victims has just been recommended (Rapport du Comite d'6tude sur l'assurance automobile, Quebec 1974).

Int'l Droit Comp. 851.</page><page sequence="4">516 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 23 struction of the Civil Code.15 The Louisiana story has a different twist.16 In the first place, the exculpatory clause which the Napoleonic Code, as we saw, ex- pressly applied only to teachers, artisans, and parents, extends under the Louisiana Code' 7 also to "masters or employers" (though no longer to parents"8). However, with respect to masters and employers, the courts by sleight of hand eventually read this limitation out of the statute,19 thereby bringing the law into line with the Common Law principle of vicarious liability for servants or employees as applied elsewhere in the United States. They displayed no lesser ingenuity and sense of 6irection in handling the "liability for things": this time, however, by linking it to the liability for fault, spelt out in preceding articles2"1 corresponding to arts. 1382-3 of the French Code.21 In the upshot, Louisiana law in this instance declined to travel the high road of strict liability charted by French law, preferring instead the low road of the Common Law fault doctrine. In mole recent years, however, dissident voices have been raised once more, seeking to revitalize the forgotten "liability for things" in support of a stricter liability for injury caused by defective vehicles. In 1968 Tate J. (then in the Court of Appeals) sounded a clarion call for following the French route,22 motivated perhaps less by a romantic flirtation with the French heritage (cultivated by a small segment of the local legal fraternity)23 than by the desire to promote a widely 15. But Cr6peau, President of the Civil Code Revision Office, recently com- mented that the projected revision of the Civil Code "must, at the very least, accept two basic proposition: i. A strict liability imposed on the owner of a car involved in an automobile accident, with avoidance of liability only by proof of a fortuitous event or irresistible force other than those that might re- sult from the state of health of the driver or the condition of the vehicle... ("Civil Code Revision in Quebec," 33 La. L. Rev. 921, 943 (1974)). 16. See generally Theale, "Tort Law in Louisiana-The Supplementary Tort Articles 2317-2322," 44 Tul. L. Rev. 119 (1969). 17. The current version of the Louisiana Code was originally enacted in 1825. The articles dealing with "offences" were directly derived from the French C.C. See Batiza, "The Actual Sources of the Louisiana Project of 1823: A General Analytical Survey," 47 Tul. L. Rev. 1, at 89 (1972). The bitter de- bate (between Batiza, Pascal and Sweeney at 46 Tul. L. Rev. 4, 585, 603) over whether the earlier Code of 1808 was primarily of Spanish or French deriva- tion has no bearing here. 18. The reference to "parents" in the original Code of 1808 was deleted in the 1825 revision. Reversing a prior trend, it was recently held in Wallace v. Bucher,--So. 2d- (1975) that parents were strictly liable even for damage caused by their children under the age of discernment. This differs from French law only in that there the liability is presumptive, not strict. 19. Weaver v. W.L. Goulden Logging Co., 116 La. 468, 40 So. 798 (1906). 20. Arts. 2315-16. 21. Cartwright v.

After failing rather dismally to per- suade the Supreme Court to this radical point of view,24 Tate J. has now found an ally in Barham J.25 who prefers, however, to cross more cautiously the mine field of entrenched legal sensibilities by advanc- ing the more modest-sounding proposition that fault was not exhaus- tively defined in terms of intent and negligence but could include also a form of strict(er) liability based on non-negligent fault.26 This see Dainow, "The Planiol Treatise !on the Civil Law: French and Louisiana Law for Comparative Study," 10 Am. J. Comp. L. 175 (1961). An earlier de- bate took place between Ireland, "Louisiana's Legal System Reappraised," 11 Tul. L. Rev. 585 (1937) and Daggett, Dainow, Hebert &amp; McMahon, "A Reap- praisal Appraised: A Brief for the Civil Law of Louisiana," 12 Tul. L. Rev. 12 (1937). The Louisiana mixed tradition has also been recently bruited by Oppenheim, "To What Extent are Judicial Decisions and Legal Writings Sources of Law?", in Law in the United States in Social and Technological Revolution [National Reports for the IXth Congress of the International Aca- demy of Comparative Law] 7 (1974). 24. Cartwright v. Firemen's Insurance Co., 223 So. 2d 822, 824. 25. Justice Barham's credo in these matters is revealed in his "A Renais- sance of the Civilian Tradition in Louisiana," 33 La. L. Rev. 357 (1973); also his "Liability without Fault," 17 La. Bar. J. 271 (1970). 26. This Alice-in-Wonderland equivocation was first enunciated in Lang- lois v. Allied Chemical Corp., 258 La. 1067; 249 So. 2d 133, 136 (1971). It recalls R. Keeton's "Conditional Fault in the Law of Torts," 72 Harv. L. Rev. 401 (1959). Contemporaneously it also gained currency in supporting the rec- ognition in Louisiana of strict liability for defective products, combined with the fictitious imputation to the manufacturer of knowledge of the product's de- fectiveness (such knowledge being required by C.C. art. 2531 as a condition for recovery of damages-as distinct from rescission-for breach of warranty: see Weber v. Fidelity and Casualty Insurance Co., 259 La. 599, 250 So. 2d 754 (1971) (Tate J.) and Welch v. Outboard Marine Corp. (5th Circuit) 481 F.2d 252 (1973) (Wisdom J., another illustrious Louisianan). The fictitious imputa- tion of knowledge to manufacturers goes back to Pothier (Vente ? 214) and was well established in France (see Kessler, "Products Liability," 76 Yale L.J. 887, 921-4; Mazeaud, "La Responsabilite Civile du Vendeur-Fabricant," 53 Rev. Trim 611 (1955); H.C. Ficker, Die Schadensersatzpflicht des Verkdufers und seiner Vormanner bei Sachmaingeln in der Franz6sischen Rechtsprechung, ch. 3 (1962)) before being "received" in Louisiana in Doyle v. Fuerst &amp; Kramer Ltd., 129 La. 838, 56 So. 906 (1911). (French jurisprudence now tends to impute knowledge to all professional sellers.) For a time this reform in Louisiana was confined to food and drink; it was first extended beyond the vendor-vendee relationship in 1952 and in the most recent cases (like Weber) to other prod- ucts, no doubt under the influence of contemporary developments in neighbor- ing common law jurisdictions (see Restatement, Torts, Second ? 402A). Inter- estingly, French courts were travelling the same route, first by extending the benefit of C.C. art. 1645 (presumed knowledge) to all persons within the dis- tributive chain, now tentatively also to others injured by the defective product (construing breach of art. 1645 as "faute" for purposes of delictual liability under art. 1382): see the exhaustive and up-to-date study by Ghestin and Viney, La Responsabilite Civile des Fabricants et Distributeurs de Produits en Droit Frangais, prepared for the Paris seminar on products liability, January 1975 (mimeo). Quebec has, by comparison, followed a typically more conservative course. Like Louisiana, it imputes knowledge of the defect to manufacturers, but limits the remedy to buyers in privity. The "ultimate consumer" must prove negli-</page><page sequence="6">518 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 23 nostrum was especially appropriate for defective vehicles because of their high danger potential.27 The liability was to be based on pre- sumptive fault rebuttable by proof, not of due care in maintenance, but perhaps of third party intervention or a fortuitous event. Notably, this new learning would not go to the length of break- ing with the traditional tort rule of negligence regarding the operation of motor vehicles. But in limiting strict liability to structural defects, it would still be in line with the more general tendency to treat this particular responsibility with special stringency. Some countries, prominently Sweden,28 draw the same distinction of imposing strict liability for the one but only negligence liability for the other. Some other countries, like France,29 Germany,30 and Italy,31 with stricter regimes for automobile accidents simply treat structural defects as in- herent risks of the enterprise and therefore outside such defences as cas fortuit or "external cause."32 Anglo-American law at a critical period of legal development missed the chance of classifying, if not- flatly-all driving, at least the driving of all defective vehicles as an abnormally dangerous activity subject to strict liability.33 More lately, however, there has been evidence of second thoughts in the United States. A number of jurisdictions treat at least brake failures etc. as presumptive negligence on the basis of statutory violation,34 gence: see Note, "Manufacturer's Liability for Defective Products," 15 McGill L.J. 142 (1969). 27. Theriot v. Transit Casualty Co., 263 La. 106, 267 So. 2d 211 (1972) (Tate and Barham JJ.); Simon v. Ford Motor Co., 282 So. 2d 126, 129-31 (1973) (Tate and Barham JJ.). See Comment, 48 Tul. L. Rev. 754 (1974). 28. Gomard, "Compensation for Automobile Accidents in the Nordic Coun- tries," 18 Am. J. Comp. L. 80 (1970). 29. The gardien can defend only on the ground that the accident was in reality not caused by his car, but by a fortuitous event or vis major (an ex- ternal factor) that cannot be imputed to him, e.g., the acts of the plaintiff him- self or of a third party. Vice de construction, not being deemed exterieur de la chose, thus affords no defense.

J. Comp. L. 156, 158 (1954). 30. The Road Traffic Law ? 7 specifically allows (only) the defence that the accident was "due to an unavoidable event that is caused neither by a de- fect in the condition of the vehicle nor by a failure of its mechanism."

Vanier, 50 Cal. 2d 617, 327 P.2d 897 (1958), the Supreme Court of California had, over Shenk J.'s dissent, expressly rejected the claim to ex- tend outright strict liability to brake failure. But the majority admitted as the only defense that the violator "did what might reasonably be expected of</page><page sequence="7">1975] COMMENTS 519 while California recently went to the length of treating the car own- er's responsibility in this regard as a nondelegable duty, involving vicarious responsibility for the negligence of repairmen.35 Beyond that, the newly developed strict liability imposed on manufacturers of defective products36 assures no-fault protection to victims of de- fective vehicles at any rate where the defect can be traced to those responsible for launching them into the stream of distribution. In- deed, though this liability rests in a formal sense upon the manu- facturer or other distributor, the cost is of course passed on to the customer so that, in the last resort, it becomes part of the cost of driv- ing. In the upshot, we have another notable instance of singling out automobile defects, as distinct from operational mishaps, for a spe- cially tailored strict liability of the operators. For the comparativist, this brief interim report on the current Louisiana scene might be of interest not only for the continuing vagaries of the French-inspired "responsibility for things", but also as a reminder of the tendency for legal systems to transcend doctrinal differences in straining toward the same or similar solutions to com- mon problems. However, the route travelled in each of the three jurisdictions here considered has been very different. Perhaps the contrast between Quebec and Louisiana is the most revealing. Louisi- ana emerges in the deep shadow of her common law neighbors, the courts progressively adjusting construction of the Civil Code to the developing Common Law doctrine around them. Indeed, somewhat paradoxically perhaps, resurgent consciousness of their Civil Code heritage is here aiding the very process of enlarging the sphere of strict liability. This goes alike for their stance on vicarious liability, products liability and now the current stirrings toward strict liability for driving defective motor vehicles.37 By contrast, the Quebec courts (abetted in the old days by the Privy Council in London) have stead- fastly maintained their conservative commitment to the ancient verities of the fault doctrine in tort and the privity dogma of sales law, amidst her (on the whole) barely more venturesome common law a person of ordinary prudence, acting under similar circumstances who desired to comply with the law." (Now Evidence Code ? 669(b) (1).) Accordingly only unexpected equipment failure can excuse. Ohio has gone even further by insisting that violation of the "assured clear distance ahead" statute cannot be excused at all by brake or other equipment failure: "An emergency caused by failure to comply . . . is a self-created emergency." See Spalding v. Waxler, 2 Ohio St. 2d 1, 205 N.E.2d 890 (1965). 35. Maloney v. Rath, 69 Cal. 2d 442, 445 P.2d 513 (1968). 36. Including all who are in the business of selling, such as middlemen and retail dealers. See Restatement, Torts, Second ? 402A comment f; Prosser, The Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) 663-64. A recent example of strict liability im- posed on a used car dealer for defective brakes is Peterson v. Lou Backrodt Chevrolet Co., 304 N.E.2d 729 (Ill. App. 1974). 37. Indeed, recent decisions have carried this direction well beyond the Common Law: especially Wallace v. Bucher (supra n. 18) with respect to parental liability and Holland v. Buckley, 305 So. 2d 113 (1974) in discarding the scienter requirement from liability for domestic animals (dog bite). Sig- nificantly, in these cases also, Barham and Tate JJ. carried the ball.</page><page sequence="8">520 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW sister provinces. Here it will take legislation, already under way in the area of automobile accidents, to realign Quebec law more closely with the bolder and creative course of French jurisprudence which has repeatedly proven its vitality by moulding the same unpretentious Code sections to suit more nearly the conditions of modern life in an urban and industrial society.</page></plain_text>
