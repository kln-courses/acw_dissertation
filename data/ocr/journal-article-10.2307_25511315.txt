These are outlined here and their doctrinal and behavioral implications explored. Evolutionary naturalism with its Darwinian and pragmatic roots is delineated, its significance for a left-liberal politics aimed at social engineering and a more egalitarian collectivism further developed. Social reconstruction of a non-invidious and non-emulatory kind and the political means for achieving it is suggested. The political action necessary for the renovation of existing atavistic continuities such as corporate-commercial class-based hegemony, nihilistic and anarchistic individualism, and religious conservatism is tentatively and provisionally advanced. In short, both the means and ends and much of the metatheoretical basis of institutional economics are outlined to encourage a more publicly visible and self-conscious intellectual posture on the part of evolutionary social scientists. One which focuses on its doctrinal basis, political aims and long term policy intent as well as on the personal deportment of institutionalists themselves.

Commons. I am no exception since my intellectual pedigree includes all these men and C. Wright Mills, too. But to this list I would like to add the name of Lenny Bruce whose book How to Talk Dirty and Influence People had a great impact on me as you shall soon see. Before I get to the more formal part of my address, however, I would like to put the following questions to the audience. You need not raise your hands in answer to these queries! But, ask yourselves, how would you answer these questions if they were put to you directly and you were under obligation to answer them candidly? 1. How many of you voted for George Bush for President in either 2000 or 2004? 2. How many are registered Republicans and consider yourselves to be politically conservative? 3. How many of you attend church regularly and subscribe to either the Nicene or Apostles Creeds as a statement of your formal religious faith? 4. How many of you engage regularly in conspicuous consumption, deliberate waste, or conspicuous abstinence from socially useful labor? It is unnecessary to count heads and keep records on how each of you voted as we have reached consensus without cumbersome democratic procedures. Let me now summarize the consensus which clearly shows that you are not conservatives, do not vote Republican, are not religious and are leery of violating the Veblenian imperatives! Evolutionary naturalism underlies the political theory and social criticism of institutionalism and binds together these and other facets of its paradigmatic cosmology. It is from this philosophic underpinning that we hope to make it into a more politically and ideologically coherent movement. Or do we; that is the question? Many organizations take strong pledges against oppression and subjugation and in favor of social justice. This means the repudiation of sexism, racism, classism, homophobia, ageism and ethnocentrism among others. This, of course, raises the question of to what extent, or if, professional organizations like AFEE, ITVA (International Thorstein Veblen Association), AFIT (Association for Institutional Thought), and EAPE (European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy) should take binding stands on philosophic, moral and public policy issues? Or is it preferable simply to take the articulation of a statement of principles loosely construed as adequate? Probably few of us would require political and ideological litmus tests for entry into our ranks. Yet through self-selection and institutional breeding, we have acquired a considerable degree of doctrinal unity past, present and likely into what Veblen calls the "calculable future." Institutional economists have often attempted to project or at least to discover some kind of unity within our ranks. In their presidential or award addresses such as this, they often announce their findings. Policy coherence, political convergence,</page><page sequence="3">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 291 common tradition and even cosmological unity are said to exist among us. To these I would add political and moral obligation stemming from the social nature of human existence which obliges us to engage in altruistic activities as a matter of individual deportment. There is a large and apparently growing number of charitable and service organizations with secular political and ideological objectives scattered along the left-liberal end of the doctrinal spectrum that many of us support. These range from the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), the Red Cross, and the coalitions to restrict firearms, to Amnesty International, Human Rights Witness, Care and Planned Parenthood ad infinitum. As secular humanists we feel obligated morally and doctrinally to so act. Or at least that is the assumption upon which the more formal part of my address that follows rests. Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy The social criticism and political philosophy of institutionalism has rarely been set forth systematically.1 Nor have we been altogether candid as to where it leads as regards our sociopolitical activism. Admittedly, there is no ideological or political litmus test for admission into our ranks. Obviously, however, my view of what constitutes an "institutionalist" includes most of the members of AFEE, AFIT, ITVA and EAPE, and it is their commonalities I want to explore. I focus on what I take to be their perspective, which I do not think has been adequately or coherently summarized before in a sufficiently candid manner. Institutional economists not only make certain philosophical assumptions, they also have related, but often unacknowledged, political and sociocultural objectives. These are outlined here and their doctrinal implications are explored. Evolutionary naturalism with its Darwinian and pragmatic roots, and its significance for a left liberal politics aimed at the social engineering of a participatory democracy and a more egalitarian collectivism are delineated. Social reconstruction of a noninvidious and nonemulatory kind and the means for achieving it are suggested. The secular, instrumental knowledge necessary for the undermining of existing atavistic continuities such as corporate-commercial hegemony, nihilistic and anarchistic individualism, and religious conservatism is tentatively and provisionally advanced. In short, both the means and ends and the philosophic basis of institutionalism are articulated in an effort to encourage the emergence of a more publicly visible and self conscious political posture. Institutional economics is part of the progressive enrichment of evolutionary naturalism. Evolutionary naturalism is, of course, the philosophy of the American pragmatists John Dewey and George H. Mead; institutional economics is that of Thorstein Veblen, John R. Commons, and Clarence Ayres, among others. Understanding the connection between evolutionary naturalism and institutionalism requires an analysis of the genesis of both in Darwin and evolutionary biology as well as in Western philosophy and social thought. In order to lay bare the foundations of</page><page sequence="4">292 Rfck Tilman contemporary heterodox economics, I argue for a more explicit recognition of all this by institutionalists. This is done with the intent of pushing evolutionary economics in the direction of a more overt recognition of its own alignment with the doctrines of secular humanism and progressive political action. Institutionalists as Evolutionary Naturalists If there is a "metaparadigm" in most social science disciplines, and often there is, how could institutional economics be classified? Clearly it is a "subculture" of a larger community of inquiry. Also, because of its strong focus on value and valuation, it involves social criticism and political philosophy. As avowed evolutionary naturalists we espouse instrumentalism and a secular humanism as the underpinnings for a left liberal political outlook. Plainly, we are not mere explorers of the social world because we favor certain kinds of social reform and cultural development. We aspire to use the knowledge we have acquired to shape society to achieve the "general welfare" to which we assign rather specific meaning. Moreover, as a political movement most of us are knowledgeable about our own intellectual pedigree and are able to refer to our ideational antecedents, an unusual feat for economists. This allows us to support social engineering of a collectivist nature without having to turn in our ACLU cards and abandon the defense of civil liberties. We are interested observers, and sometimes perceptive critics, of both domestic and international affairs. But to most of us the human drama falls entirely within nature and the natural order of which we are a part. The generic uniformities and variations of nature converge with the shape and mold of any social order. There is no way to isolate humanity from its natural existence ? whether such a claim is motivated by class or individual self-interest, emotion, routine, or authority. Measures of value among humans, as well as exotic deviations from the norm, are no more than artifacts of nature and humans, as one part of nature, must adapt to other parts of it. Homo sapiens, in our view, are thus the biological template and the repository of prior experience, both social and individual, within the natural order and it is nothing else. We attack as "ceremonial" what appears throughout the social order in the form of deposits of inefficiency and inequity which we would replace with a more rational and just set of social arrangements which we call "instrumental." Underlying the latter are the ideas of progressive change found in the ethos and practice of science, the secularism and egalitarianism secured by the advance of technology and humanistic ends pragmatically derived from value codes; Veblen's "generic ends of life," impersonally considered. But how are secular humanism, evolutionary naturalism and left-liberal politics linked with the history, evolution, doctrine and contemporary politics of institutional economics? What connects the moral-philosophic underpinnings and social dynamics of evolutionary economics with its political aims? And what is the larger doctrinal significance of such a paradigm? Why have institutionalists been reluctant to overtly</page><page sequence="5">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 293 state their immediate and long-term goals for social amelioration, indeed, to articulate their aims for social engineering and reconstruction? Why is their refusal to identify the political vehicles or technology necessary for this transformation? Or are these accusations unjust? Aside from loss of nerve and a resulting self-censorship, one answer is the presence of most academic economists in or near colleges of business with their flocks of would-be consultants looking to ambush any loose change. Worse yet, and perhaps more intimidating, is the conservative focus on self-interest, unlimited acquisition and consumption that infuses the determination of many business faculty to teach their students how to be predatory, emulatory, and acquisitive as Baldwin Ranson has so often suggested. Further, why the reluctance to endorse or even articulate the cosmology of evolutionary naturalism? After all, it takes only a modest ideological or doctrinal sophistication to discern the actual philosophical tenets of institutionalism and link them with secular humanism. Perhaps it is because the creed of secular humanism involves more than an examination of its evolutionary naturalist roots. For secular humanists come in many different sizes and shapes, from Marxist to libertarian, and it is necessary to specify the value orientation of institutional economists that sets them off from other doctrinal groups. This requires a brief recapitulation of the views of leading American thinkers from which institutionalism draws its intellectual pedigree starting with Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey but also including C. Wright Mills. For Dewey, the desirable consequences of acts are those which encourage social and institutional change that would enhance individual and social growth leading to still more growth. But of what does "growth" consist and how is it to be promoted? And how is this criteria itself to be evaluated? These are the aspects of Dewey's teachings on social and institutional change which the values of Veblen and Mills have the potential to clarify and reinforce. Both Veblen and Mills converge doctrinally with Dewey as regards the latter's idea of "self-realization." Dewey, of course, was analyzing the process by which individual potential is fulfilled; that is, growth as a means to more growth, a greater degree of self-direction, unification, and increase in meanings and ability to communicate, an expansion of self-consciousness as, for example, when the individual achieves a stronger sense of self-identity, a greater capacity to empathize with others as well as to engage in ethical analysis or moral deliberation. Indeed, "self-realization," as a generic construct in Dewey's work, may be understood as a by-product of all these. Similarly, what "self-realization" meant to Veblen, was fuller development of his three "peaceful" traits, that is, critical intelligence (idle curiosity), altruism (the parental bent), and taking pride in work and doing it the best way it can be done (workmanship). These also infuse Mills' notion of "craftsmanship." For all three, humankind's social legacy is the opportunity to become all he [she] is capable of becoming.2 But at whose expense, at what social costs, and with what political consequences, as Doug Brown asks us?</page><page sequence="6">294 ^c^ Tilman As an approach to valuation, instrumentalism is a naturalistic theory that utilizes corrective processes through judgment of consequences and effects. It is seriously at odds with those ethical and evaluative stances that are either radically relativistic or absolutist in nature. For example, the belief in the subjectivity of values that permeates conventional economics assumes an inaccessibility or isolation that privatizes all value criteria. Thus, values are so subjective that when moral goods conflict there are no standards by which they may be judged. But a method does exist by which to demonstrate that some value choices are superior to others. Of course, this is the method of social-adjustment or individual self-correction that makes ends congruent with means and means congruent with ends along a means-ends continuum oriented toward proper human growth. The relevant consequences are those upon which successful growth is contingent and how it is to be defined; no small matters. The Immediate Political Future The political vehicles and technology essential for achieving the ends of a more egalitarian collectivist society than we now possess are identifiable. If progressive change is to occur with ends favored by institutionalists it will be hastened by appropriate political action. This is most likely to be achieved through a coalition of classes, interest groups, ethnicities and genders that presently lack adequate political power. It will be accompanied by the usual mixed motives of altruism, pragmatism, and material self-interest, and led by the conventional assortment of Democratic politicians, independents, and intellectuals leaning a little further left of center than usual, and backed by working majorities in both houses of Congress. If it is not unduly given to military intervention abroad, it might concentrate on domestic policy and achieve a degree of institutional rejuvenation and reconstruction. Such an administration in Washington could serve as a catalyst for undermining the ceremonial and strengthening the instrumental components in our culture. Heavier taxes on upper income earners, more effective regulation of corporate enterprise through both the market and public control of industry and finance, more adequate provision of collective goods and services and redistributive policies would be in order. Unnecessary military spending and an end to, or at least a curbing of, certain corporate subsidies might also be in store. Would some institutional economists be chosen to serve in such an administration? After all, who can forget that Franklin Roosevelt and his cabinet appointed Edwin Witte, Rexford Tugwell, Adolf Berle, and Thurman Arnold; Clarence Ayres and John Kenneth Galbraith also served as functionaries during the New Deal. Are such changes in store for us after the fall election in 2008? Probably this new administration, if it materializes, will look untidy, especially to the uninitiated. It will bumble along in fits and bursts at times like a constipated, or at least flatulent, Model-T Ford. Opportunists and vested interests will attempt to gain concessions. But the forces of countervailence will be in place to move us in the direction where the instrumental surmounts the ceremonial, at least for the time</page><page sequence="7">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 295 being. And the ceremonial in American political life is largely embedded in corporate-commercial and class hegemony, along with its major socio-cultural support bases which are found in religious conservatism and anarchistic and nihilistic individualism. In this regard, the transnational progressivism of the American liberal left variety may be poised to not only score some important political victories, but to weaken the long-term foundation of the ceremonial. Obiter Dicta The "social surplus," that is, the abundance of economic resources above and beyond what is necessary for a decent livelihood for all is partly skimmed off by a parasitical predatory upper class, and much of it is wasted by the rest of us. The use of this surplus for emulatory purposes and sheer economic waste and dissipation has clearly spread to other social classes; witness Las Vegas where it results in a mass waste of what might otherwise be a socially useful expenditure of resources. In any case, one can readily visualize other purposes to which these and other now largely dissipated economic resources might be put were we to assure every American of a secure and decent livelihood. We are "skeptical of untested claims to knowledge" and "open to novel ideas." As Darwinians, we could scarcely be otherwise, for we are process thinkers focused on the exploitation of a dynamic science and technology, and we deny the likelihood of social and cultural stasis. Human experience may be consummatory at times, but such consummations are historically transient, fleeting, and often ephemeral. The progressive enrichment of evolutionary naturalism transmuted into secular humanism will not be progressive if it sinks into eternal cultural verities and immutable moral truths. But that does not condemn us to radical relativism either. The value constants in our culture which command our respect and provide good service to society should not be abandoned and rarely have they been more enduringly articulated than by Veblen, Dewey and Mills. Institutionalists have attempted, both as social activists and scientists, to influence the scientific community, the politically sensitive public, and, ultimately, the underlying population against conservative and reactionary attitudes toward race, ethnicity, poverty, criminality, war, and religion. Our political outlook and convergent research agenda aimed at undermining theories that rested on prescientific or, more often, unscientific, pre-Darwinian grounds. These included vitalistic, teleological, introspective, animistic, anthropomorphic, metaphysical, and spiritualistic explanations of the natural and social orders. After all, most of us are rarely found in a place of worship on Sunday, and we have jettisoned the ideological baggage that usually accompanies regular church attendance. But the substitutes for religion just enumerated should not be allowed to creep back in. As Bill Dugger and Glen Atkinson suggest, institutional economics is about much more than critiquing neoclassical economic models and methodologies. It also concerns the philosophy and practice of democratic policy-making as well as the ways and means, values and beliefs of the egalitarian way of life. We must address the issue</page><page sequence="8">296 Jfok Tilman of social change and political mobilization rather than the usual institutionalist critique of neoclassicism. But before we can do that we have to think more clearly about human nature and our ability to take public policy actions. This means furthering collective action and this requires focusing on political action over choices from a fixed agenda. The alignment of institutional thought with evolutionary naturalism, secular humanism and left-liberal politics is an obvious one even if it is not as commonly voiced as it should be. In short, it is essential to draw out both the foundations and implications of the normative character of institutionalism. Signs of Change and Resistance to It? When Bob Dylan sang that "the times, they are a changing" a generation ago, he may not have had country music in mind. Yet no competent observer of our order can ignore the socio-cultural change now taking place in America or the conflict it engenders. Even country music exhibits this tension as when singer Alan Jackson tells us we would be better off, if "everybody, everywhere had a lighter load to bear and a little bigger piece of the pie."3 Unfortunately, he fails to inform his audience of how to achieve this. Singer Don McLean explores a Veblenian theme when he says: "I hate fashion. I hate it with a passion. Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?"4 McLean, too, fails to tell us what to do about our plight. But as cultural commentary and analysis it is interesting to note that some of the most-change resistant subcultures in our society are in the throes of exactly that ? change! After all, the Pope has now declared himself to be a traffic director (this refers to the Pope's recent decree on how automobile drivers should treat each other) based one supposes on his experience in the Wehrmacht and the Hitler Youth. What may lie ahead is a papal demand for a church-sponsored discount sale of condoms in Rome! I will not speculate any further on changes that appear likely in the Mormon Church or among Protestant fundamentalists except to suggest that the anticontraceptionists among them may find their adolescent children infected with a strong dose of the clap, or something worse, unless they receive revelation from on high about the virtues of contraception. Homilies, Behavior and Value While these parts of the religious establishment are not held in much esteem by most institutionalists, the audience should be reminded that empirical studies have shown that conservative religionists give more to charitable organizations than secular liberals, even after controlling for that portion that is given directly for religious purposes. Why is it that secularists on the liberal left give proportionately less than conservative religionists mostly on the right? And what should be done about it? Perhaps we could tithe, that is, give ten percent of our income to appropriate non religious charitable and non-profit organizations. This change would, at least, put us on the same moral footing as those who have strong doctrinal and policy disagreements with us.</page><page sequence="9">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 297 Zero population growth? What is to be said on behalf of institutionalists who have more than two children? I will not answer this question today! But the best example we could set is to help curb population growth and urge others to do the same. What excuse is there for me using this forum to offer advice on how to spend your money and limit the size of your family? The answer is simply that I am urging the recognition of institutionalism as an explicit doctrinal and political movement with related policy objectives that involve personal deportment. Some institutionalists may not want to merely repeat the litany of value according to Veblen about the "generic ends of life" because they find it abstract and impersonally vague. There is nothing in institutional economics which precludes subscribing to older ethical models. To the contrary, my final homily in this regard is that ethical inquiry in a changing moral landscape can create new ethical codes by using parts of older ethical models, and this may include the morality of ethicists from several philosophical and religious traditions minus, of course, the supernaturalism. Politics, Philosophy and Potentiality Most institutionalists are not ignorant, naive, or apathetic regarding politics and social issues. Furthermore, most are philosophically informed enough to espouse a kind of secular humanism. Indeed, with one or two possible exceptions I have never encountered an evolutionary economist who was or considered themselves to be "religious" in any formal or conventional sense. Why? Although we never denied the potential of the Judeo-Christian tradition for the provision of moral and psychological insights, we did not perceive it as a fully independent variable. Instead, it was most often viewed as a strategy of superstition, institutional rationalization, clerical domination, and, frequently, class subjugation. Thus, if one seeks to achieve a broader understanding of the role of religion, it is an error to separate it from its sociocultural roots and its political consequences. The intellectual movement(s) of which Dewey, Veblen and Mills were important catalysts is still rolling forward, converging with new, but hopefully congruent currents, and opening up novel lines of cultural and intellectual inquiry. It is our alternative to formal and informal religious belief and practice. In an age when religious fundamentalism, the Roman pontiff and post-Vatican II Catholic teaching, and Mormonism are archaic alternatives, the presence, and persistence, of evolutionary naturalism is to be welcomed. Philosophically (and cosmologically) we are secular humanists and evolutionary naturalists who are more than skeptical of the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and the meaningfulness of eternal salvation. As Mills put it: There is no God's Truth: the only truths are those defined by the cultural apparatus. There is no eternal beauty; the only beauty is the object created or indicated by some set of cultural workmen. There is no absolute good: the only good is the variety of cultural values with which one is morally comfortable or morally uneasy.5</page><page sequence="10">298 Jfok Tilman However, it would be misleading to conclude that we go the full distance to a radical postmodernism that is fully relativistic wherein reality is merely a social construct. We know full well that some values are more rationally defensible than others, and that brute facticity in the natural and social order must always constrain the social construction of reality. In this sense, we are still children of the Enlightenment, albeit critical ones. Institutional economists are intractably opposed to the irresponsible exercise of corporate power, anti-social individualism, and dogmatic religious conservatism that are endemic in our political culture and social existence. To repeat myself, the three main components of resistance to progressive political change at present in the United States are: (1) corporate-commercial hegemony and the resulting class structure; (2) individualism as nihilism and anarchism; and (3) religious conservatism mostly of the Christian variety. Any tactics or strategy for relieving our burdens must focus on the removal or, at least, the amelioration of these barriers. It is evident that these barriers are often buttressed by cultural lag and drag as evidenced by vested interests and vested ideas, and are an arena wherein metatheory as truth, reality and value separates us from our doctrinal opponents. The necessity of using a price system, a market mechanism, and identifying and protecting property rights does not commit us to unceasing preservation of existing institutional forms. Mostly, these aspects of the economy are organized the way they presently are either because it is expedient or because vested interests support them, and it is important to distinguish between these two rationales. In any case, our aim must be the creation of a non-invidious, non-emulatory community based on instrumental knowledge as Marc Tool urges us. This requires a continuous striving to reduce the ceremonial, and to enhance the instrumental aspects of our society, and it requires that cultural criticism and political philosophy focus on critical analysis of ceremonial residuals and practices, that is, pockets of inequity and inefficiency. Yet lurking in the shadows are the persistence of atavistic continuities and imbecile institutions whose regressive resurgence in the forms of war, exploitation, waste, inequality and superstition still threaten humankind. We cannot yet be Pollyannas who believe we have reached the land of milk and honey where we can live together peaceably under eternal conditions of voluntary simplicity and economic abundance. But, perhaps a partial Utopia has now appeared on the historical scene and political agenda as a possibility whose ultimate realization is at least worth striving for. However, as evolutionary naturalists we know we have to act within the world as it is; and in order to change it we have to adapt ourselves as one part of nature to nature's other parts without resorting to religious claims about the cosmos and source of life. This requires the realization that institutionalism is and should be a political and doctrinal movement consciously avowing its evolutionary naturalism and seeking egalitarian collectivist ends through left-liberal politics. In short, using instrumental knowledge to move in the direction of a non-invidious, non-emulatory industrial republic, one where flux, change and adaptation are always present.</page><page sequence="11">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 299 Conclusion Efforts at building a political and ideological coalition on the liberal-left with other dissenting social scientists and heterodox economists such as Postkeynesians, less dogmatic Marxists, social, environmental, feminist and other minority economists has appeal insofar as these groups are committed to work within the framework of constitutional democracy, use the techniques of social experimentation, and do not advocate a Utopian condition of social stasis. If such efforts have not yet proven overly successful, there is no reason for despair. Patience is essential for the ripening of cultural and socio-economic conditions which will make reconstructive and ameliorative situations possible. But so is a concerted focus on what is to come of such a coalition. Is it merely to be another interest group boring from within the Democratic Party? Or does it attempt to bring about a more progressive politics from the Left regardless of partisan affiliation. Or would it simply be a device for promoting intellectual and scholarly cohesion among liberal-left social scientists without immediate and explicit policy objectives? Clearly, given my analysis, using the Democratic Party as the chief political vehicle of reforms is the inevitable choice despite the frustrations and disappointments that undoubtedly lie ahead. The American tradition of empirical collectivism is an interpretation of our political thought and behavior articulated many years ago by UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) political scientist Currin V. Shields. It suggests that, in the final analysis, the majority will determine the following; first, what constitutes a bona fide public problem, that is, what requires collective action for its remediation versus what can be left to private individuals for its solution; second, which level of government, local, state or federal, should be selected for problem resolution; and, third, how bona fide problems can be resolved without unduly damaging the existing social fabric. In my view, most institutionalists have traditionally used this framework, wittingly or not, to analyze problematic situations with an eye to ameliorating them. Although the American tradition of empirical collectivism may be overly optimistic about the realities and possibilities of genuine majority rule, it does suggest the existence of countervailing forces against a status quo buttressed by commercial-corporate hegemony and its cultural and moral pillars of support, which are in anarchistic and nihilistic individualism and religious conservatism. These countervailing forces include liberal-left intellectuals with a transnational bent, the poor, ethnic minorities, women, environmentalists, consumers, cultural-aesthetic groups, some unions, and so forth, and it appears that there is identifiable continuity in both the social composition of these groups and their political aims. All of which leads us to the existing power structure in the United States, especially at the national level. This is important both in terms of understanding our society and, of course, planning to change it. A generation ago, scholars and intellectuals of our political persuasion were split between those who endorsed a ruling class view a la Paul Sweezy or G. William Domhoff, those who subscribed to C.</page><page sequence="12">300 Rick Tilman Wright Mills' power elite thesis or something akin to it, and those among us who favored the pluralistic-elitism thesis a la Morton Baratz and Peter Bachrach. Probably few institutionalists were still persuaded by the David Truman-inspired conventional interest-group liberal, pluralist theory. The debate thus centered around whether the United States was dominated (1) by a ruling class composed of the owners and managers of the major industrial, financial and agro-corporations; or (2) by a tripartite elite of corporations, and high-ranking political appointees and bureaucrats in the executive branch of the government mostly drawn from corporate walks of life and militarists in the Pentagon and the armed forces; or (3) was America governed by a pluralistic set of elites supported by their satellites in the upper-middle class? Choosing among these three alternatives after discarding the conventional wisdom forced us to focus on the genesis and development of power and the possibilities of countervailence. In short, are we dominated by those who live off surplus value and engage in massive acts of emulatory consumption and waste or, at least, aspire to? Or by some variant of a system of power relations which permits more dispersion and fragmentation of authority? The often heated debate over who rules America produced no scholarly agreement or theoretical resolution among its participants, most of whom were political scientists and sociologists. Nevertheless, political power, wealth, and social status are generally viewed as linked in perhaps complex ways, which in any case, show the relative impotence of mass society. It is these politically inert elements which institutionalists hope to galvanize into more intense and creative political participation and action. Most Americans can at present be placed along a continuum that at one extreme can be labeled "economic individualism" and at the other "egalitarian collectivism." The first sanctions profit seeking, material gain and acquisition of property, and focuses on exchange transactions of a pecuniary nature in pursuit of self-interest. The other seeks the provision of collective goods and services and equalitarian and redistributive policies that will benefit lower and middle-income groups. Any politically relevant assessment of American voters must focus on these opposing tendencies. All political action of significance or intent at social construction must face this reality and act accordingly because most voters are an amalgam of both the individualist and collectivist tendencies just described. This is why it is so difficult to build a coherent doctrinal structure as well as a durable reform movement which can deal effectively with our problems. Evolutionary naturalists, secular humanists, and political left-liberals we may be. But until we more self-consciously avow this both to ourselves and others, and act publicly in accord with these beliefs, we fail our own doctrinal heritage and are unlikely to change America into a less invidious socio-political and cultural order. In the meantime, in the words of the immortal Oliver Cromwell "keep your bowels open and your powder dry." And moving forward 350 years in one fell swoop "(i]f you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem," as the New Left used to say.</page><page sequence="13">Institutional Economics as Social Criticism and Political Philosophy 301 Notes 1. One intriguing effort exists, however, although it is primarily economic and summarizes the unity of analysis and policy intent of institutionalists versus neoclassicists. See Richard M.

Klein, "Institutionalism as a School?A Reconsideration" Journal of Economic Issues 24 (June 1990): 381-388.

To further illustrate, suppose we persist in asking what standards or criteria other than majority rule should determine the separation of what is public from what should remain private? A set that might be employed is provided by Martha C. Nussbaum in her Frontiers of Justice (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006) in which she argues for a "capabilities" approach. These capabilities include life (being able to live a life of normal length); bodily health; bodily integrity (being able to move freely from place to place, to be secure against violent assault); sense, imagination and thought; emotions (being able to have attachments to things and people); practical reasons (being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection concerning how to achieve this); affiliation (being able to live with and towards others and having the social bases of self-respect); species awareness (being able to live with concern for other animals); play; control over one's environment (being able to participate in political choices, being able to hold property rights), and so on. The list is intended by Nussbaum to be open-ended, and subject to revision. But the idea underlying it is that "we can argue, by imagining a life without the capability in question, that such a life is not a life worthy of human dignity." This quotation is from Mark Rowland who is summarizing Nussbaum's case in his "Out of Contract," Times Literary Supplement, (February 3, 2006): p. 26. 3.
