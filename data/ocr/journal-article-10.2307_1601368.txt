In recent years, drastic political changes in France have produced nothing but new questions on the national administrative pattern. The "alternance" did not basically alter public administration weight or social structure. At the same time, as a new institutional game was installed (decentralization, EC integration process, new demands coming from citizens), administrative change ("modernization") gained new interest. A general discussion of this modernization process (civil service management, policy evaluation, etc.,) shows that, in many respects, administrative reform is a substitute for political change. The traditional State-centred political system recently gave way to a pluralistic policy- centred system. But, if there are no more ideological controversies around public administration, nor are there any more political guidelines for the modernization process. Public administration in France has always been a major component of the polity. Public policies or administrative regulations occupy a privileged place in day-to-day political activity. Since the end of the monarchy, the "administrative question" has been at the root of major political changes. Governmental reform or administra- tive reorganization plans generally have been linked with a more global discussion about what the State is supposed to do or to be. During the first Revolution or in the early years of the Third Republic, public administration was supposed to create a new social order, and civil servants, like school teachers, were to be more than simple agents of the common will. They had to transmit the Republican traditions and values, a collective conception on legitimacy and "normal" politics (Charles, 1987; Berstein and Rudelle, 1992). On the other hand, the civil service was desig- nated across time as a specific investment opportunity for social groups, during conservative as well as Republican and liberal governments. This function was reinforced during the Fourth and Fifth Republics. For lower and middle ranks of society, the civil service offered upward mobility as for the upper classes it was a 0192-5121 93/04 403-016 ? 1993 International Political Science Association</page><page sequence="2">France in Search of a New Administrative Order necessary step for entering politics. Revolving doors, connections between ministries and business-like public corporations, ministerial cabinet upheavals, and common training in the National School of Administration did not allow much difference between political and upper administrative elites (Birnbaum, 1977). More than in any other industrialized country, political change in France depends upon the administrative system. Major public policies, as in the field of education, are as highly resistant to external pressures as they are embedded in a corporatist decision-making process. Some ministries, such as the national education ministry or the finance ministry, are commonly designated as "fortresses," either they are supported by strong civil service corps or they rely on captive "customers"' habits or on having a delicate equilibrium with grass roots interests. Radical political changes have little impact on these organizations because any government needs them in order to maintain social peace and, by extension, its own life. The worst thing a French government can face is an implicit or explicit agreement between civil servants and users when they both consider that "their" policy is jeopardized. Various socialist governments in 1981, 1983 and 1988 as well as the conservative government in power from 1986 to 1988 experienced such a constraint when some of the long planned and politically sensitive reforms fell short of expectations, especially in the industrial sector. However, the concentration of technical exper- tise within civil service ranks and professional dedication to the "general interest" proved to be invaluable resources for launching new policies in order to cope with industrial or research challenges. To be brief, public administration exercises a veto power over changes that could affect existing policies, but intervenes as a real polit- ical force when innovative policies have to be established (Quermonne, 1991). Unlike the United States Constitution, that of the Fifth Republic was not built upon a theory of democracy but upon a theory of the state (Rouban, 1990). The admin- istrative apparatus was regarded as a shield against private interests and possibly against social protest. From this perspective, most administrative reforms or reorga- nizations were of a technical nature, aimed at legal or professional considerations. Most discussions of administrative change are based on the Weberian functional dichotomy between politics and administrative action (Peters, 1992) that is supposed to be still at work in industrialized countries. The French case, however, demonstrates that a real administrative change is a political change, and that any real political change generally means a drastic administrative change. One needs to be careful to distinguish cases of endless technical reforms, which have little meaning for political science studies, from structural transformations that imply new rules of the game for political actors as well as professional bureaucrats. The crisis of the French public administration model reveals a deep political change as central state structures are challenged by the policy-making process that is devel- oping. In recent years, a major change has occurred as a new "administrative modern- ization policy" was initiated. For the first time an administrative reform survived different politically-oriented governments. The fact that this reform has occurred when many observers have pointed to a political crisis affecting the whole French polity indicates a renewal of the national administrative apparatus. I will discuss how this global administrative change is not only highly connected with political change but also may be considered as a substitute for more drastic political change. In many respects, the French administrative modernization policy reflects the managerialist fashion of the 1990s. But apart from the fact that any discussion about ungovernability has been strictly unthinkable within the civil service since the 404</page><page sequence="3">Luc ROUBAN Second World War, it is noticeable that France is the only Roman Catholic country in Europe' to have engaged in a public management revolution. This indicates that other social structures are under high pressure, giving way for new considerations about state action and political legitimacy. In other words, the modernization policy reveals major changes in the national polity even if it is still too early to decide upon its fate. Finally, I will argue that administrative reform in France reflects a more general phenomenon concerning the building of a post-welfare state public administration in highly industrialized countries. French Public Administration Model in Crisis Historical research as well as recent empirical data show very clearly that the tradi- tional French public administration model today is in deep crisis. Since the begin- ning of the Fifth Republic, this model has been characterized by three features: (a) civil servants acted as recipients of state power. Far from being common wage earners, they did not belong to a professional world but rather to a career system where corporatism was supreme; (b) administrative legitimacy was given priority over political legitimacy. The idealized image of the high civil servant was at the heart of social and economic modernization from the 1960s to the 1980s; (c) decision making was prized while policy evaluation got low marks for its purely technical aspects (Rouban, 1990). This public administration model relied on a combination of political and social structures that gave it its quasi-anthropological character. Such a model defined career prospects as well as success criteria, behaviour rules as well as communica- tion channels between users and public administration. In recent years, all three characteristics were under great pressure. Public administration change came first from inside as social structures evolved. In addition, the traditional relationship between public administration and its political environment was upset when new demands emerged from civil society. Social Factors In 1986 and 1987 strikes warned the government that something was going wrong within the civil service ranks. For the observer, these social protests were very inter- esting because they forecast change in the traditional social status of civil servants. Far from being restricted to salary requests, the strikes were motivated by a strong feeling among civil servants of social decay. Strikers, whether nurses, prison guards, or air traffic controllers, asked for social recognition of their professional skills and duties. They were looking at new careers more than better salaries. At the same time, unions were put aside and public sector workers organized themselves into nonpartisan protest movements (coordinations). A major explanation for such a crisis is that the civil service no longer offers upward social mobility (Bodiguel and Rouban, 1991). At the middle and low grades, applicants competing for positions are currently overqualified. In all competitions, the average job/applicant ratio was 1:11 in 1987 compared to 1:6 in 1978 (Ministere de la fonction publique, 1991). Most of the applicants for B category positions (middle managers) generally have more than four years of higher education. One can easily find for category C positions (clerical staff) agents who have spent more than two years at university. But better qualifications do not mean automatically better personnel advancement. On the contrary, middle level managers are 405</page><page sequence="4">France in Search of a New Administrative Order confronted daily by senior civil servants, with comparatively poor professional specialization, who were hired in the 1950s, when skilful people fled the civil service. As the number of internal advancement opportunities dropped, upward mobility through internal competition became tough. Increasing instability and demoraliza- tion were the two main results of this change. Personnel management therefore became a problem for bureau chiefs in most ministries. At the same time, the higher civil service became more socially selective. The ambitious goal of the Ecole nationale d'administration (ENA) founders, democratization of the upper civil service recruitment, remained unfulfilled. During the last 25 years, the upper classes have been over represented. This situation was reinforced in the late 1980s: during 1981-85, 65 percent of ENA students came from the upper classes (families of public or private higher officials, engineers, businessmen) as opposed to 38.7 percent in 1955-62. A recent study of high level managers shows that 71.9 percent of those who competed in the external competition were from the upper classes. This is especially true for members of grands corps like the Conseil d'Etat or the Cour des Comptes. Similar results can be observed for other sectors (Rouban, 1992). Social differentiation between different grades and corps produced nothing but the strong feeling that the notion of "career" itself was obsolete. A second crisis factor is the loss of purchasing power. Some members of the upper civil service pay grades lost up to 20 percent of their average purchasing power between 1980 and 1988 at a time when new demands came from the govern- ment for better personal productivity. Confronted with a new working environment (microcomputers), cutbacks in management, and budget and staff restrictions, public managers discovered that their social status had been severely altered. They could no longer compare favourably their salaries and working conditions with those of private sector managers. This change was all the more noticeable as private "success stories" filled newspaper pages and money became the only criterion of personal accomplishment in the so-called "socialist" French society of the 1980s. As a result, the rate of departure from the civil service to the private sector climbed in a few years. In scientific and technical fields, salaries frequently were 100 percent higher than those offered in universities or scientific institutions. These personnel moves are a departure from the traditional exchange between the public and the private sector (the pantouflage) in that they concern younger civil servants and occur even within the grands corps with growing frequency. When asked, 28.5 percent of high level managers answer that they plan to leave the civil service at least for a while (Rouban, 1992). But this is a global figure. For younger managers (between 25 and 40), this proportion is 59.1 percent. A third factor of change is related to the evolving role perception within the civil service. First, there is a point to be made about the building of the frontier between the public and the private sectors. In the republican tradition, the civil servant was imagined to be guided by virtue whereas lay behaviour was imagined to be narrowly guided by self-interest. This conceptual framework survived during the Third Republic when the first public employee unions appeared. Administrative laws reinforced this social classification, clearly distinguishing public work from private work, public contract from private contract, and so on. All this legal development was strongly supported by what may be called a "public sector ideology" that denied civil servants the right to behave like other wage earners. In recent years, however, surveys have indicated that civil servants and private wage-earners share a common organizational culture (Bodiguel and Rouban, 1991). Today the two groups commonly trust private firms for economic development (68 percent in the two 406</page><page sequence="5">Luc ROUBAN groups), no longer trust political parties or labour unions (only 38.6 percent of public workers trust labour unions as opposed to 33.8 percent of private sector wage- earners), are more attracted to the EC or regional programs than to those elabo- rated through the state. Classical constraints on public personnel management seem outdated. For instance, the traditional dissociation of organizational reward and individual results has been discarded in favour of more accurate personnel performance appraisal systems. A second point to be made is that day-to-day work has changed. Legal knowledge and general culture for a long time constituted basic civil service training. Paradoxically, the "technocratic" side of French society disguised social disdain for pure technical knowledge, a notable difference from the German situation. The French upper civil servant was not a pure British-style "amateur", nor an American- style "professional." By the late 1970s a clear separation had occurred between grands corps members whose culture remained unchanged and middle-level managers systematically confronted with technical predicaments in central departments as well as in field agencies. Purely technical jobs appeared in those sectors where personal contacts with users were crucial for global efficiency (for example, in hospi- tals, transport, and telecommunications). Emphasis on technical values fostered a new quest for personal accountability. Unfortunately, this change did not, until recently, produce any serious reform of professional job descriptions (this was particularly so with computer specialists). Towards a Policy-Centred Public Administration A public administration model has three interrelated features: a professional under- lying logic organizing career paths and success criteria; a functional/organizational legitimacy (what kind of service is a civil servant supposed to deliver? how? and where?); a political legitimacy (what are the respective roles of politicians, public services' users and civil servants?). Public administration models do not change just because social structures evolve. Sometimes technical devices can be implemented that reduce tensions and protests. The rationale for change can be found in the disintegration of the logical compo- nents of the model, that is, when professional expectations, day-to-day workload constraints and political legitimacy requests are disconnected, calling for a new institutional equilibrium. This was the case in France. Professional prospects no longer matched the requirements of organizational legitimacy. Another disruption occurred between the career system and political legitimacy. The renewal of polit- ical demands transformed civil servants' familiar environment. As mentioned earlier, civil servants were usually considered in France to be the main actors in the decision-making process whatever the constitutional basis of representative politics. Policy implementation and evaluation were always put aside as technical matters. In the last ten years, several variables have greatly modified the way public administration has been run. First, there has been a shift in political legitimacy. Policy implementation has gained new interest as volunteer political change proved unsuccessful. The very lesson learnt from political changes in the 1980s is that socio-political structures cannot be altered in a few months. The conservative government of 1986-88 failed to privatize social security. The various socialist governments of 1981-86 failed to publicize all educational institutions. Better results were obtained when prime minis- ter Michel Rocard decided in 1988 to launch reforms that paid much more atten- 407</page><page sequence="6">France in Search of a New Administrative Order tion to implementation obstacles, that is, to social structures. Finally, many ideolog- ical oppositions vanished in the late 1980s as most citizens looked for fiscal restraints and public efficiency in day-to-day life. Traditional borderlines between right and left solutions, which have delineated public life for two centuries, faded. In many cases, policy choice internally divided political parties lacking the legitimacy to decide technical matters, as was particularly observable in the integration of the EC, environment protection, and defence policy. Traditional centralized decision making gave way to a pluralistic policy-centred system. This long-term political change led to a political crisis. Since the elections of 1988 the number of voters has dropped at an alarming rate, unknown during the Fifth Republic or before: 66 percent for the 1988 legislative election and 48.9 percent for the 1989 European election (Brechon, 1990). Moreover, politicians were often cited for misconduct and bribery (Meny, 1992). As a whole, the political class became subject to public contempt and were regarded as parasitic. Second, the decentralization process launched in 1982 reinforced the trend of giving more power to local authorities in welfare policy implementation and monitoring. As a major institutional reform, decentralization created a new strate- gic environment for national civil servants who were confronted in field offices with locally elected officials' demands (Mabileau, 1992; Sadran, 1992). Their monopoly on expertise was eroded with the mushrooming of cities and departmental techni- cal staff. Local authorities attracted some of the best and brightest former sous- prefets and prefets with better salaries, giving them decision-making power they had lost when they were part of the national civil service. Ministry of infrastructures or ministry of social affairs field agents were called upon more and more to act as negotiators and mediators, to coordinate separate initiatives. They became partners in a game they had controlled a few years earlier. Third, policy communities opened up as public interest groups got more power in such fields as environmental or consumer protection. Furthermore, European integration policies and decentralization multiplied opportunities for specialized pressure groups to interfere with policy making. Traditionally, French corporatism was professional and fragmented. In some sectors, such as agriculture, pressure groups succeeded in influencing national issues (Keeler, 1987). Nevertheless, as a whole, the relationship with pressure groups had been poorly institutionalized. The civil service was probably the only sector where one could find neo-corporatism. Public managers now have to deal with a growing number of "associates" none of whom is likely to exercise real control over sectoral issues. In recent months, unexpected strikes in the transport sector infuriated public opinion as officials seemed unable to formulate a clear policy on the conflict. Since then, communica- tion channels between public administration and professional interests have been multiplied and weakened, although more explicit demands have been made for better results and more pragmatic considerations. Administrative Modernization Policy In many respects, the administrative modernization policy launched in 1986, and developed since 1988, is just one stage in more profound state reforms. These reforms are intricately tied in with more classical reorganization plans aiming at reducing state weight. Devolution of administrative authority to field services, the transfer of national institutions (such as the National School of Public Administration) from Paris to regional capitals, deregulation and simplification of 408</page><page sequence="7">Luc ROUBAN legal procedures are long-term efforts connected with modernization. Nevertheless, modernization offers true institutional innovation in that it relies on a bottom-up underlying logic and departs from traditional top-down reforms. Moreover, it is the first time in recent French history that the state has been viewed not as a social modernizer but as a modernizable apparatus. This means that the civil service has been somewhat instrumentalized in the sense that it has to obey new organizational rules designed to foster public productivity and effectiveness. Guidelines Since its inception, the administrative modernization policy has been based on a double assumption: that public managers have to pay more attention to the quality of the service delivered with their personal responsibilities increased and that civil servants' involvement is crucial in order to get better results, as global efficiency depends on individual behaviour and not on miracle management formulas. Paradoxically, these general guidelines, drawn from private international management, were developed not only by the 1986 conservative government but also by its socialist successors. Of course, the same tools were used from different perspectives. The 1986 government initiated "quality improvement" task forces in order to soften the unpleasant consequences of cutback management in an era of privatization and staff reduction. In 1988, prime minister Michel Rocard decided to strengthen the modernization process in order to find a surrogate for a political reform that was not an option because of the electoral situation. It was necessary to reconcile the State with society and civil servants with politicians. The 1989 decree described the philosophy of this reform. A high priority was given to the human resource management (through training sessions, professional and geographical mobility, career path renewal), personal accountability (through systematic "administrative statements" describing targets and resources in each service), policy evaluation (through creation of new advisory and analytical institu- tions), and a users' service (through communication efforts and business-like relationships). Within these broad guidelines, each agency and bureau was free to set up experiments or long-term innovative procedures. The civil service ministry was only given a co-ordination role (Rouban, 1989). Two factors played a major role in these reforms' success. First, the government found no real opposition within unions, whose representatives were in disarray. Pay bargaining had been at a stalemate since 1987 and union membership was getting low. Even more politicized unions like the Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and Confederation fanfaise des Travailleurs chretiens (CFDT) found merit in the reform. Pay bargaining and career system reorganization were connected for the first time in French civil service history when a general agrement was reached in 1990 to facil- itate upward professional mobility. Second, on a conceptual basis, the reform did not raise ideological and legalistic questions about the civil service's general status. These questions previously had impeded any change in the public administration system. In the aftermath of the first socialist victory of 1981, the Mauroy govern- ment had tried unsuccessfully to apply this legal framework to all public agents, including hospital and local workers. In 1986, the conservative government of Jacques Chirac had frightened 2.5 million civil servants with privatization prospects. Four years after the Rocard decree, it appears that the modernization process stimulated many experiments. More than 400 strategic plans were adopted in most ministries, especially in their fields offices (80 in the ministry of infrastructures, 69 409</page><page sequence="8">France in Search of a New Administrative Order in the ministry of agriculture, 25 in the health ministry), hundreds of "quality improvement" task forces were set up (more than 200 in the finance ministry), 85 quasi-contractual agreements between the civil service ministry, the ministry of finance, and agencies were reached to promote financial and staff autonomy in management units. The administrative modernization policy is a blend of managerialism and statist interpretation of public administration reform. The French paradox is that manage- rial solutions were adopted outside a convenient political environment. While other European countries tried to reduce public expenditures, the welfare state was alive and well in France. Modernization procedures were developed without the concep- tual framework a conservative political agenda could offer. Assessment To what extent does the French experiment exemplify the new public management ideology as it has spread in Europe over the last few years? While traditional public managerialism emphasized cost-cutting and collective performance indicators, this new management ideology essentially has a threefold basis: civil servants' individ- ual performances measurement takes the place of universalistic conceptions and general status; contracts are the basis of maximizing choices; agency fragmentation separates those who regulate and those who deliver (Pollitt, 1990). These charac- teristics are clear in recent administration reforms that occurred in Great Britain. As far as France is concerned, the modernization process only partially reflects this new ideology. Of course, devolution of administrative authority, as a general princi- ple enacted in the 6 February 1992 law, is a decisive step towards a new deal between central departments and field agencies. More pragmatic attention has been paid to personnel management procedures through more frequent personal performance assessment interviews. But public service ethics have not been given up and various governments have never accepted systematic extra pay rewards for individual performances. Contractual flexibility was given to agencies on the condi- tion that they comply with the civil service general status rules. The privatization spirit was quite absent from this reform and the civil service system was not turned upside down. Two questions may be asked: What are the outcomes of the administrative modernization policy? And what are the prospects for more radical reform? Regarding the first question, many indicators show that reform was fruitful. In many sectors, users' service was dramatically improved, delays were shortened, costs were brought down. The field offices of the ministry of infrastructures and the ministry of telecommunication successfully implemented new quality and perfor- mance indicators, the ministry of the interior central departments enhanced profes- sional training and personnel management, and the ministry of social affairs stressed policy evaluation and computerization. Recent empirical data (Rouban, 1992) show that, if upper level public managers generally felt satisfied with modernization, they expected much more from this reform.2 When asked, 53.1 percent responded that modernization has had at least a moderate effect on administrative internal functioning, as opposed to 17.8 percent who responded that it has had an important effect. Their expectations are gener- ally high and compensate for poor career prospects. Only 5.4 percent think that these prospects are very good and 39.5 percent that they are just good as against 32 percent who estimate that their further career advancement looks bad or very 410</page><page sequence="9">Luc ROUBAN bad. Only 10.6 percent consider that their pay level is reasonable given their workload. Nevertheless, as a whole, the modernization policy has produced positive outcomes. 84.4 percent of civil service executives are currently engaged in modern- ization procedures. Among the most frequent operations, one can find administra- tive strategic plans (39 percent), computerization initiatives (25.3 percent), and personnel training (15 percent). 61 percent of the sample state that agency produc- tivity increased, 60 percent that professional relationships were eased, 63.6 percent that users' service quality was improved. The main obstacles come from financial constraints (16.8 percent), from middle-level managers trying to protect their niches (21.8 percent), and from routine or traditions (23.6 percent). As for demands for further reform, a large majority of public executives are asking for more autonomy in personnel management matters. 89.8 percent ask for more personnel performance appraisal, 84.4 percent for free choice of their closest colleagues, and 76.6 percent for the right to fire incompetent colleagues. Other indicators clearly show that these civil servants, who are currently the depositaries of administrative culture and tradition, are looking for more drastic change that could initiate a quite different administrative model. For instance, 75 percent would agree to give up the traditional category and grade-pay system for a pay-for-perfor- mance system. Moreover, 70.7 percent think that things could be better if the general legal constraints were eliminated. It seems that there is room for further steps in the direction of private sector style management. On the other hand, other questions reveal that these executives maintain traditional values as far as their understanding of roles is concerned. This is especially true for civil servants working in purely administrative sectors (such as members of grands corps, ministry of the interior, or ministry of education executives). Institutional memory relies heavily on personal contacts (83.2 percent of them know their predecessor, 26.3 percent worked with that person), personal accountability is largely ignored (72.3 percent of them answer they are accountable to three people at the most and 6 percent to no one), and tasks are not precisely defined (for 35.5 percent they are not defined at all). Modernist elites may be found in scientific or technical sectors (such as the ministry of infrastructures, ministry of telecommunications, or the postal service) where the proportion of private sector style managers is noticeably larger. This is easily understandable because these sectors have conceptualized their environment in business terms and are likely to use the most interesting applications of manage- ment tools. From Post-Welfare Politics to Post-Welfare Public Administration Public administration is becoming the favourite playing field where governments try to implement drastic changes when policy change seems unrealistic or narrowly determined by previous social equilibrium. Political change through public admin- istration relies on the underlying assumption that inefficiencies, wastes, abuses, or any kind of political failure are a result of maladministration and bureaucratic behaviour. Administrative reform is a powerful instrument for separating political accountability from administrative accountability. If something goes wrong in any social sector, the blame is put on poor policy implementation and not on political choice or policy design. Managerialism reflects a common tendency among contem- porary governments to escape public criticism. Nevertheless, as shown in the French case, administrative reform has limits and requires long-term political guidelines. 411</page><page sequence="10">France in Search of a New Administrative Order Any structural change in public administration models calls for explicit political reform. New organizational values have spread through French politics in the post- welfare pluralistic society, calling for more choice and a better management. But what are the main characteristics of a post-welfare public administration model? Limits to Administrative Change There are at least two main limits to administrative change in France. The first point is that public administration is nothing less than selecting and ordering social elites. Modernization policy is confronted by social structures that forbid change that upper civil servants would be unable to control. The second point is that ideological guidelines have disappeared. There is no more global "theory of admin- istrative action" that could support further administrative evolution. As demonstrated by the administrative modernization policy, change rhythms vary according to sectors and organizational values. Scientific and technical managers have pioneered administrative modernization not just because they have been operating in business-like work but also because their social origins do not resemble those of classical administrative elites. In fact, technical sector executives' social profile is lower than that of administrative sector executives. They do not share a common training or common values (Rouban, 1992). In technical corps, the proportion of popular and middle class representatives is higher than in the admin- istrative corps. For instance, 28.6 per cent of Corps des Mines executives (ministry of industry) come from the middle classes and 28.6 percent from a lower class; 26.7 percent of Corps des Ponts executives (ministry of infrastructures) come from the middle classes and 23.3 percent from a lower class; 47.4 percent of Ingenieurs telecom (France Telecom) come from the middle classes and 10.5 percent from a lower class. These three sectors got the highest marks when confronted with a 7-variables scale about modernization involvement. By way of comparison, 80 percent of Conseil d'Etat members come from the upper classes, 20 percent from the middle classes and none from a lower class; 76.9 percent of Cour des Comptes members come from the upper classes, 15.4 percent from the middle classes and 7.7 percent from a lower class. On the 7-variables modernization scale, these grands corps get the lowest marks. Other indicators can be used to show that professional heredity is higher in classi- cal administrative sectors than in technical sectors. One may contend that a strong professional heredity strengthens traditional administrative values and prevents institutional innovation. The proportion of public managers coming from one or two generations of civil servants is lower in technical corps than in administrative corps. Similarly, the proportion of technical corps managers with a father and a grandfa- ther who worked in the private sector is higher. Similarly, scientific and technical degrees are less socially selective than govern- ment courses. For instance, 42.9 percent of executives having a Ph.D. in science come from the upper classes, 42.9 percent from the middle classes and 14.3 percent from a lower class. In comparison, 71.9 percent of executives hired through the National School of Public Administration external competition come from the upper classes, 20.3 percent from the middle classes and 7.8 percent from a lower class. The conclusion is that there is no social homogeneity within higher civil service ranks and that modernist values do not appear randomly. Social differences are largely correlated with professional behaviour and organizational values. This social heterogeneity prevents any massive managerial revolution. Public administration is not just a political tool but also offers social investment resources 412</page><page sequence="11">Luc ROUBAN for the upper and middle classes. As technical and managerial values are connected on the one hand, and administrative and legalistic values are connected on the other, a social distinction occurs between modernist and conservative elites. This is the first major impediment to any structural change in French public administra- tion. Figure 1 shows public managers' social origins, Figure 2 their professional heredity, and Figure 3 their involvement in modernization along the lines of the 7-variable behaviour scale.

The variable "Mean" is the mean of all the sample. The absence of any global "administrative action theory" is another impediment. The Fifth Republic administrative rules were disputed both by socialist and conser- vative critics on the grounds that public administration could serve as an economic tool or could bridle public executives' action. The 1981 socialist administrative project had ties with the 1936 Popular Front bureaucratic illusions, but the govern- ment quickly gave up its reform efforts in 1983 when economic conditions worsened. In like manner the 1986 conservative government tried to import Reaganism and Thatcherism to France but forgot that bourgeois children were all looking for positions in grands corps or ministerial cabinets. Nevertheless, things were simple and historical traditions or clear-cut political choices could be invoked in designing administrative reforms. In the 1990s, however, managerialism has hardly any polit- ical expression. A public administration crisis creates a political crisis in that neither the socialist party nor the conservative opposition parties have clearly accepted the end of their ideological confrontation even if carrying it on now looks unwise or ineffective in policy decision making. There is no more public adminis- tration politicy theory, at least at the national level. In many respects, local politics proved to be more adaptive because mayors and Conseils Generaux chairs clearly articulated local administrative management reforms and political targets. In the aftermath of decentralization, new political modernist elites encountered new administrative elites. Public management offered intellectual guidelines as well as strategic resources to mayoral teams which took power during the 1983 and 1989 local elections. In major municipalities, the renewal of local management was heavily supported by innovative political projects intended to lead to urban economic development. Post-Welfare Public Administration A major debate has been initiated in France about the state's future (Delmas, 1991; Lenoir and Lesourne, 1992). Confronted with local politics and EC integration, the 414</page><page sequence="13">Luc ROUBAN state's functions are likely to be restricted to policy monitoring and evaluation. In order to cope with a post-welfare state, what would be the main characteristics of the new national public administration model? The French welfare state public administration model has three features: (a) line administration delivers public goods or services through rule making and checks entitlement rights; staff administration decides upon major strategic options; (b) sectoral agencies treat questions closely connected to professional interests; social function is divided into thematic areas (agriculture, health, transport and so on) with each public policy controlled by a dominant profession; (c) public administra- tion is a tool to be used in order to achieve global political aims. Politicization is confined to the cabinet level, which is in charge of agenda setting. This kind of institutional equilibrium was commonly observed in many Western states because it mixed traditional representative politics and functional integra- tion of corporatist demands. In comparison, an ideal and typical post-welfare state public administration model would require three changes: (a) administration would regulate the decentralized agencies which would deliver public goods and services; there would no longer be a clear-cut distinction between line and staff manage- ment; (b) agencies would have to resolve intersectoral problems, involving public interest groups as well as professional pressure groups; public policies would no longer be connected with just one profession; (c) public administration would no longer be a technical tool but rather a secondary political market where strategies could be implemented without national debate. It is possible to exemplify such an evolution in the French case, although other national cases might be more suitable (for example, Britain or Sweden). The most notable recent change in France has been the emphasis put on policy evaluation. This emphasis departs radically from Fifth Republic political logic. Until the late 1980s, political life was dominated by a technocratic decision making and majority rule politics. International comparisons and academic studies demon- strated that policy evaluation was a useful new tool for policy monitoring and fine tuning in an era of scarce resources (Nioche and Poinsard, 1984). Nevertheless, scholars' ideas are not always welcomed by professional bureaucrats who oppose their pragmatic knowledge to any "external" consideration. In fact, a new set of policy evaluation institutions (including an Interministerial Committee of Evaluation, a National Fund for the Development of Evaluations, and the Scientific Council of Evaluation) was created at the prime ministerial level in 1990, ten years after the beginning of this debate (Nioche, 1991). This institutional innovation worried many upper level civil servants, especially those dedicated to controls and checks. This shift in the administrative model was largely due to political uncer- tainty at a time when the socialist party had lost its absolute majority in parlia- ment. Most public policies reflected off the record arrangements with right or centre politicians. Policy evaluation was "rediscovered" as a legitimation tool for political compromise, given that the real decision-making process was delegated to agencies through policy implementation. The other characteristic, largely shared in most industrialized countries, is the growing intensity of civil service politicization. This is a striking tendency because it has always been contended that public management and politicization were two different orders. In fact, in all countries which have experimented with manageri- alism, civil service politicization was pronounced. In France, the two phenomena had been associated since Valery Giscard D'Estaing's presidency in 1974. The turnover of department heads, which was about 14 percent between 1958 and 1974, 415</page><page sequence="14">France in Search of a New Administrative Order rose to 25 percent between 1974 and 1976, then climbed to 31.4 percent between 1981 and 1984. In 1967, one observer concluded after a systematic investigation that most ministerial cabinet members did not belong to any political party (Kesler, 1985). In comparison, 69 percent of them belonged to majority parties in 1981. Since then, this trend has been accelerated as policy choices have required more political resources. Cabinets' influence on day-to-day administrative life is growing and today middle-level managers complain about their interference. A French "spoils system" was institutionalized as public administration became another polit- ical market where policy options could be decided. Not surprisingly, recent data confirm this basic evolution (Rouban, 1992). When asked, 47.5 percent of public executives said that the civil service was more politi- cized than a few years earlier, 44.9 percent that it was neither more politicized nor less politicized, 5.6 percent that it was less politicized. What is the explanation for this divergence of opinion? For only 13.6 percent of public executives, politicization is related to recent political changes, "boss system" practices, and elected leaders' dismissal of state values. Nevertheless, for a large majority, politicization is related to a basic evolution of French democracy: 37.1 percent say that politicization is related to more stringent politicization of all public choices, 27.3 percent say that it is related to new demands from elected leaders for more political responsibility, 22.4 percent say that it is related to renewed interest in policy follow-up (cumula- tive percentages). Civil service politicization is connected with the evolving relation- ship between public administration and the political sphere, where politicized and specialized choices require civil servants to act as advocates of government decisions through using their technical expertise. Conclusion Public administration modernization reflects two phenomena: a strong socio-polit- ical change and a new equilibrium between public administration and politics. In that sense, the French case may illustrate the difference between sectoral admin- istrative change and global administrative change. Most classical public adminis- tration studies are dedicated to sectoral changes, where public administration is treated as a technical tool at the disposal of elected leaders for specific purposes. Following that, administrative change explanations alternatively refer to rational actor models or to systemic environmental models (Peters, 1992). But in both cases, implicit administrative functions are ignored and institutions are studied through an anthropomorphic theoretical framework: state or administrative institutions act like human beings, with choices, goals, survival needs, and sometimes unconsciously. When introduced, social functions within administrative systems highlight the limits of any global change that would require a drastic conceptual shift. It is likely that modernization will have some political backlash. As senior civil servants are increasingly confronted by new professional requirements for techni- cal and business-like skills, attempts will be made to reorganize the elite member- ship. From this perspective, two scenarios are possible. On the one hand, a conservative scenario would see a clear-cut separation drawn between grands corps dedicated to regalian functions and other upper level managers. This solution has already been studied as a way of coping with new EC regulations opening national civil service positions to other EC civil servants with the noticeable exception of those positions which imply regalian authority. On the other hand, a progressive scenario would see drastic change in National Administration School training and 416</page><page sequence="15">Luc ROUBAN recruitment as well as in the corps system in order to promote specialized knowl- edge, pay-for-performance, and systematic exchanges with private sector positions. This latter possibility is certainly considered threatening for many members of the entrenched corps, who will fight to keep the status quo. However, in the long run, major political change is likely to occur, as public action will surpass state action. Local elites are ready to take over former state programs. The EC integration policy is speeding up this process by calling for more public management in complex insti- tutional settings. What is at stake in the administrative modernization process, along the lines of the new management ideology, is not just the relative efficiency or quality of bureaucratic tools or the new political demand for effectiveness and accountability. Another politico-administrative equilibrium dedicated to cope with post-welfare state needs is emerging through administrative reform. The administrative speci- ficity of the Fifth Republic relied on political and social arrangements which have disappeared in the last ten years. This change is all the more sensitive in France since public administration was at the core of the polity. But, in France as elsewhere, it is likely that in the near future political theorists will have to revise dogmas about representative politics and separation of powers. Managerialism, as a new ideology, does not mean the end of politics. On the contrary, it means that public administration is now day-to-day politics. Notes 1. Of course, the case of Spain could be raised, but, because of its history, modernization there reflects more the concepts of the 1970s (hierarchical lines, information technology) than those of the 1990s (cutback management, devolution of administrative authority). 2. This study is based on a 501-case sample (from a total population of 5 000 national admin- istrative executives) elaborated through gender, geographical administrative density, and sectoral quotas in order to be representative.
