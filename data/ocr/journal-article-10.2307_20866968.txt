<plain_text><page sequence="1">Monkeys, Apes, and Bears, Oh My!: Illuminating the Politics of Human-Animal Relationship in Jill Greenberg's Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits Nicole Merola A photograph features a lone bear with cinnamon-colored fur. Posi tioned in the middle of the frame, the bear sits on the ground with one foreleg placed between its hind legs and the other placed to the outside right, supporting the bear as it leans slightly to the right. The chin of the bear is tucked toward its chest and it glances slightly downward, not toward the camera, but rather out the left side of the frame. A black-furred monkey, shot from the shoulders up, fills almost the entire frame of another photograph. The tuft of fur on its head stands straight up, its eyebrow ridge protrudes, its cheek ridges and nose are long and narrow, and its mouth is composed in a straight line, lips touching everywhere except the very corners of the mouth, where just a hint of tooth peeks through. Like the bear in the photograph described above, this monkey looks not at the camera but out the side of the frame, in this case the right side. But, something about each image seems awry. The eyes of the bear seem to possess much more white around the iris than they should. Perhaps more unsettling is the position of the bear's mouth. Slightly open, its corners turn up in a smile. The bear looks, essentially, like a coquette. The photograph of the monkey, especially when paired with its title, "Anxious," seems to present a complex emotion much more readily associated with humans than with primates. The above descriptions are emblematic the effects of two of Jill Greenberg's fine art series, Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits', they simultaneously seduce and discomfit, delight and disturb the viewer.1 The jac 30.3-4 (2010)</page><page sequence="2">646 jac initial response of attraction derives from the animal "emotion" proffered; seduction by this anthropomorphism is widespread. In the introduction to the book version of Monkey Portraits, Greenberg reveals her anthropo morphically inflected criterion for selecting images for the series: "What became apparent as I was making my selections after each shoot was that I was attracted to the images where the subjects appeared almost human, expressing emotions and using gestures I thought were reserved only for people."2 Greenberg's eye for the "almost human" is clearly on the mark, for popular response to the photographs overwhelmingly takes up the question of how the photographs mesmerize and delight precisely because they allow the human viewer to see what seems to be facial expression and comportment we recognize and name as "emotion." Upon first encoun tering one of Greenberg's Monkey Portraits, graphic designer Brent Piper remarks, "That's so one-step-away-from-human!" (Froenek). Reviewer Daniel Ausema also celebrates the portraits by noting their apparent humanness: "The pictures are wonderful. Greenberg is a celebrity portrait photographer and brings those skills to bear on the subjects, catching the monkeys in delightful poses, with funny or sad or thoughtful expressions on their faces. Her use of simple screens for background ... serves to emphasize the poses and expressions, making them seem more human." Blogger Laura Sweet, writing for "If It's Hip, It's Here," notes that Greenberg's portraits are "amazing" because they are so "expressive" and gushes that "she gets more personality from the faces of animals than most photographers do from people." Even artist and critic Paul Myoda, who pens the afterword to Monkey Portraits, promotes the anthropomorphic framing of the images when he writes, "Greenberg's psychologically charged monkey portraits insist that we consider the similarities [between simian and human]. ..we can't help but identify with their gaze and be reminded of people we know, expressions that we have seen before" (emphasis added).3 Registering the seductions of anthropomorphism is where most responses to Greenberg's animal portraits begin and end; no sustained critical interrogation regarding the uncanny strangeness of Monkey Portraits or Bear Portraits exists. As I will detail below, the perturbations Greenberg's photographs generate derive, in part, from the suture of her signature aesthetic style to nonhuman animal subjects. Developed initially</page><page sequence="3">Nicole Merola 647 for human portraiture, Greenberg's images feature supersaturated color, especially sharp edges, and lighting that highlights the surface of the subject in ways heightened enough to be not quite natural. For instance, Greenberg cal Is attention to one result of her work with lighting through her own taxonomic practices: she chooses the aptly descriptive phrase "Shiny Faces" to classify one set of portraits of humans on her website. The portraits of actor Andy Samberg and entertainment television news host Billy Bush especially exemplify the shine Greenberg's digital manipula tions can create. Another example of the more-perfect-than-perfect polish in her work appears in "The Rapture Index," a photograph from the series End Times. The shiny skin effect is in full force in this image of a crying child from whose lower lip a long line of drool suspends. The saliva in this photograph is too long, too sharply differentiated from the skin of the child's chin and neck, and too perfectly taut, given the tilt of the child's head, to be unadulterated. Greenberg's luminescent and more-perfect than-perfect style makes her commercial and fine art work instantly recognizable, especially because she consistently applies the same visual treatment, described often as "quirky" and "hyper-real," to subjects as diverse as political figures, celebrities, rock bands, children, synchronized swimmers, and even, recently, Hollywood's latest iteration of The Termi nator. Critics quickly labeled Greenberg, who began working profession ally in 1990, "The Manipulator"; she then adopted the sobriquet as a badge of aesthetic identity.4 The nickname signals, in part, her reliance on postproduction work with Adobe Photoshop, often eight to ten hours of digital manipulation per image, necessary to produce her work. Given the way she has positioned herself as an image-maker, the nickname also represents an instance of marketing savvy; Greenberg was at the forefront of digital manipulation and remains one of the most famous practitioners of obvious Adobe Photoshop rendering. The sleek hyper reality of her images has made her work sought after by magazines and companies that seek cutting-edge images. Wired, Rolling Stone, Time, The Advocate, and Absolut Vodka, Asics, Bacardi, Coffeemate, HBO, ING, and RCA, for example, have all utilized images created by Greenberg in advertising campaigns. Greenberg does not shy away from using her images in the service of political provocation, as demonstrated by the series End Times, which</page><page sequence="4">648 jac features photographs of crying children, and by her photographs of John McCain. For instance, she politicizes the content of the images in End Times in these comments, which appear on her website as a foreword to the series: The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation. It made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war and the scandalous way in which conflict was sold to the American people_The most dangerous fundamentalists aren't just waging war in Iraq; they're attacking evolution, blocking medical research and ignoring the environment. It' s as if they believe the apocalyptic End Time is near.... As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of what is to come. (Manipulator) Greenberg appends to other photographs in the series titles such as "Torture," "Earth," "Bad Intelligence," "Angry Country," and "Trillions," which further underscores her ideological framing of these portraits. Given her feelings about the disastrous fundamentalisms of the Bush administration, dramatized visually in End Times, it should have surprised no one that Greenberg would continue agitating for liberal politics during the 2008 Presidential campaign. Hired by The Atlantic to shoot a photograph of John McCain for the cover of its October 2008 issue, Greenberg produced an image of McCain looking only slightly polished. His recessed eyes receive no treatment that would make them seem bright and alert and, except for small patches on the sides of his face, his skin is not lustrous. Greenberg admits that she did not employ her usual arsenal of manipulation techniques: "I left his eyes looking red and his skin looking bad" (Walker). As a result, nothing about this cover photograph radiates in the ways Greenberg's other images do. McCain appears humdrum and stale, not the kind of man a voter would want to imagine in the White House.5 While these instances of the marriage of aesthetic manipulation (or the lack thereof) and liberal politics are easy to unearth, the question of where, within the field of animal studies, to locate the "politics" of her nonhuman animal portraits is more complex. Unlike the work of contemporary</page><page sequence="5">Nicole Merola 649 photographers Britta Jaschinski and Frank Noelker, whose images indict the carceral policies and practices of zoos,6 Greenberg's animal portraits do not as obviously participate in discourses about animal rights, animal liberation, the morality of zoos, or environmental ethics. And yet, by virtue of their animal content, Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits inherently nestle within longstanding debates regarding how to position human and nonhuman animals vis-a-vis each other.7 As I will argue, Greenberg's images collect, visually stage, and galvanize two different modes of possible relation between human viewer and nonhuman animal subject: projection and overidentification (the "natural" anthropomorphism of an uncritical engagement), on the one hand, and "underknowing, on the other."8 Below, I will work through the ways in which a critical viewer might transition from the former to the latter, a less biologically imperialist, and therefore more ethical ontological mode. While most viewers will be at least initially complicit in responding to the anthropomorphism of the images, I suggest below that the disjunctures between the aesthetic beauty of the work, the "emotion" of its animal subjects, and the artificiality everywhere inscribed in the images?if the viewer stays with the work long enough?can become the location for opening up the possibility of non-anthropomorphic relationality. This article, a meditation on the ethics of producing and engaging with photographs of animals, first discusses the concept and dangers of anthropomorphism, then analyzes the visual rhetoric of the photographs to unpack the affective economy of anthropo morphism in which the images participate. It then moves to consider the artifice of the images, arguing that their "unnaturalness"?or, more precisely, their status as "technonature"?functions to undercut the anthropomorphism they initially catalyze. Discussion of the obviously manipulated quality of the photographs serves as a fulcrum for foregrounding a materialist analysis of the networks of bodies and labor and technologies that enable the images. This analytical chronology, which derives from and replicates the twinned feelings of delight and disquiet created by the photographs, aims to narrate a model for how to encounter, in an ethical way, Greenberg's animal portraits.</page><page sequence="6">650 jac Anthropomorphisim and the Rhetoric of Emotion Often I have gazed into a chimpanzee's eyes and won dered what was going on behind them. ?Jane Goodall This epigraph from Jane Goodall, which is included in the book Monkey Portraits, indexes the phenomenon of anthropomorphism that undergirds the initial moments of encounter with the images in both Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits. Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human thoughts, feelings, motivations, and beliefs to nonhuman creatures or objects, necessitates an extensionist move: "At its basis, anthropomor phism involves claims about the similarity of nonhuman objects or beings to humans and the centrality of human concepts and abilities to classify across ontological categories. Strong anthropomorphism asserts that some description of a feature of human beings applies in the same way to a feature of a nonhuman animal" (Mitchell 102; emphasis added). Anthropomorphism is, then, a symbiotic action that establishes a relation ship based in human affinity with, rather than difference from, nonhuman animals. This practice has both defenders and detractors. Sociologists like James Serpell, who posits that petkeeping practices would be impossible without anthropomorphism, and Eileen Crist, who tracks the discursive ways in which nineteenth- and early twentieth-century naturalists used anthropomorphic language to constitute the animals they studied as animal subjects rather than mechanistic objects, see anthropomorphism as an operation to be defended for the ways in which it can bring human and nonhuman animals into closer proximity with each other. Following from this drawing together of the human and nonhuman, they suggest that anthropomorphism can engender a deeper understanding of both the continuities and discontinuities between human and nonhuman animals.9 On the other hand, as Sandra Mitchell reminds us, anthropomorphism has "long been considered a bad word in science," resplendent with the taint of "nineteenth-century anecdotal evidence for the continuity of humans with nonhuman animals" (100). Eileen Crist notes the "conceptual seduction" of anthropomorphism, its naivety and superficiality and senti mentality, and the ways it has misunderstood and often distorted the</page><page sequence="7">Nicole Merola 651 contours of life (152). Some opponents critique anthropomorphic projec tion based on the belief that nonhuman animals are "lesser" beings without the kinds of complex inner lives that would necessitate descriptors usually used for humans. These opponents want to retain strong and impermeable boundaries between human and nonhuman animals, drawing on a long tradition within western philosophy as a bulwark for their claims. Other critics of anthropomorphic projection do not deny the claims of animal ethologists and cognitivists that animals have feelings or emotion or motivation or belief, but they do assert that we cannot know if the thoughts, feelings, motivations, and beliefs of humans apply "in the same way" to other creatures. Philosopher Thomas Nagel, for instance, posits that animals have consciousness but that, because of differences in embodi ment, humans can never fully understand how animals experience their own forms of feeling and cognition. Because of its nature as a projective mechanism, anthropomorphism contains the seeds of potential dangers beyond those articulated above. When taken to its extreme, anthropomorphism can tip over into an exaggerated form that Anne Friedberg calls "petishism:" "a fetishism in which one overidentifies with animal Others and allows oneself to be fascinated by non-human Others."10 Two filmic examples, March of the Penguins and Grizzly Man, serve quickly to demonstrate the possible effects of petishism. In the case of March of the Penguins, which tracks one egg-laying season in the life of emperor penguins, the combination of visual information, soundtrack, and voiceover contributes to a humanized (and humanist) narrative about the penguins. Rather than framing the seventy-mile journey between sea and land, the egg-rearing practices shared by the female and male in a pair, or the communal storm weathering as evolutionary adaptations, the film frames these events as a story of love, sacrifice, and perseverance in the face of incredible odds. With this narrative ascendant, the film encourages viewers to marvel at the similarities between human and penguin families, not the evolutionary fitness of the penguins. March of the Penguins thus deploys a mild form of petishism to seduce its viewers, who may misapprehend the contours of penguin behavior. Mild petishism, and certain forms of anthropomor phism more generally, can produce positive effects, as Crist and Serpell have noted. In the case of March of the Penguins, the anthropomor</page><page sequence="8">652 jac phized narrative framing of the penguins' behaviors may lead human viewers of the movie toward conservationist activities. But there is an important difference between wanting to preserve penguin habitat be cause penguins are "like us" and wanting to preserve penguin habitat because doing otherwise would likely contribute to the extinction of a species adapted for life in a very particular location. The former reason represents an anthropocentric; justification, the latter, a biocentric justification. Grizzly Man narrates the story of Timothy Treadwell, who spends thirteen summers in Alaska communing with and purportedly protecting the grizzly bears of Katmai National Park. As is now well known, in 2003, at the end of the thirteenth summer, bears attacked and consumed Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard. Grizzly Man thus presents one occasion of the ultimate danger of petishism: a terminal obsession and overidentification with wild creatures that leads to death. And while the anthropomorphic economy operative in the relationship between viewer and animal subject in Greenberg's work may not tip over into the terminal petishism perpetuated by Treadwell, it does nevertheless stage many of the elements of a milder, yet still dangerous, form of petishism. Like viewers of March of the Penguins, humans who persist in projecting emotion onto the animals in Greenberg's photographs likely overly sentimentalize the animal subjects they see and misconstrue the circum stances that have enabled the images. After discussing at length the visual rhetoric Greenberg employs to catalyze the operation of anthropomor phism, I will return to the ways in which overidentification and emotional projection, the misapprehension inherent in petishism, makes the viewer complicit in effacing the constructedness of the "emotion" that the photographs seem to dramatize. Although they record encounters with different species, the shared visual rhetoric of Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits promotes anthropomorphism as a first response to the portraits. The photographs in both Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits employ a visually streamlined composition. A single animal occupies each frame, posed against a plain studio background. The color of the background, which in each series ranges in color from light to dark gray and which might incorporate a tinge of blue or green, depends on what hue will best foreground the animal</page><page sequence="9">Nicole Merola 653 subject.11 Fairly tight framing means the animal fills much of the photo graph, leaving little negative space. Although some of the photographs position the animal subjects in profile, and in each series a few images record the backs of animals, most of the portraits are frontal shots. Such positioning of animal bodies?deploying the faces and comportments of the animal subjects as the sites at and through which "emotion" seems to register and communicate?allows Greenberg to best galvanize the viewer's anthropomorphic tendencies. In Monkey Portraits, Greenberg also engages language, in the form of titles for the photographs and the occasional epigrammatic captions (like the epigraph above) to fortify the visual rhetoric and to circumscribe the viewer's response to the photo graphs. Although the images in Bear Portraits are untitled, Greenberg uses the epigram strategy in this text as well.12 As Donna Haraway reminds us, behind "every mounted animal, bronze sculpture, or photograph lies a profusion of objects and social interactions among people and other animals" {Primate 27). While for western people stories about primates, like those about bears, simulta neously assemble discussions regarding "the relations of nature and culture, animal and human, body and mind, origin and future," narratives about each species also articulate distinct material and mythological registers (5). The objects and social interactions at issue when we consider simian faces and bodies hinge especially on their position in the border zones between the mythic poles of culture and nature, which engenders their use as "privileged subjects by disparate life and human sciences? anthopology, medicine, psychiatry, psychobiology, reproductive physiol ogy, linguistics, neural biology, paleontology, and behavioral ecology" (1 2). Because of their close biological kinship, Haraway continues, monkeys and apes have been "subjected to sustained, culturally specific interroga tions of what it means to be 'almost human,'" and have functioned often as models of and for "a vast array of human problems and hopes."13 Bears, at least in contemporary mainstream western contexts, do not share the proximal positionality that allows simians to serve as vehicles for question ing degrees of humanness. We have created for our ursine kin, rather, sets of relations that, as Bernd Brunner comments, "play out within the poles of attraction and repulsion" (5). Tracking attitudes of western people toward bears through myths and texts from pre-modern cultures to the</page><page sequence="10">654 jac present, Brunner collects narrative moments wherein bears are described variously as wrathful, deceitful, unpredictable, cautious, suspicious, sly, cunning, wise, fearless, clever, brilliant, powerful, beautiful, and majestic (88). In the contemporary moment, Brunner suggests, humans place bears in three possible kinds of relation: bears become "teddies to love, endangered animals to save, or beasts to fear" (234). Although the monkeys and apes in Monkey Portraits and the black, brown, and polar bears in Bear Portraits all receive the same visual treatment in terms of studio setting, lighting, and digital manipulation, in conjunction with the abilities and limitations of primate and ursine bodies, the images display obvious traces of the different cultural and material histories and attitudes detailed above. In Monkey Portraits, Greenberg's images draw on and stage the homology between humans and their simian relatives: the "emotion" in this series of photographs seems genuine and easily accessible to the viewer because, in part, of the relative similarity in human and simian physiog nomy. For instance, "Petulant" capitalizes on the orangutan BamBam's stance?slightly hunched with hands on knees and elbows pointing away from the body?and his sidelong glance, wide eyes, and pursed mouth to convey his ostensible "irritation." Jake, another orangutan, is featured in the portrait "Oh Vey," where his comportment and facial expression seem to convey exasperation. In this photograph, his seated body is positioned to the right side of the frame so that his arm, which rests on one cross legged knee, and his hand, with upward palm and upstretched fingers, occupies the center of the frame. He is posed in a gesture of apparent resignation, as if he were throwing his hand in the air in recognition that he occupies a scenario about which nothing can be done. Jake's facial expression?wide open eyes and a bottom lip protruding past the upper lip as if he were expelling air in frustration?also contributes to the drama tized "emotion" in this photograph. In "Pensive," Kenuzy the chimpanzee looks to the side of the photographer rather than straight into the camera. His lips are closed in a straight line, and his facial features appear neutral, neither overly tensed nor relaxed. Kenuzy's comportment, the title of the photograph, and the Goodall quotation that faces the photograph?"Often I have gazed into a chimpanzee's eyes and wondered what was going on behind them"?combine to suggest to the viewer Kenuzy is lost in</page><page sequence="11">Nicole Merola 655 thought.14 In addition to the "emotion" conveyed by the images detailed above, Greenberg's simian subjects in other portraits seem to display the activities, sentiments, sensations, and behaviors of wincing, scolding, worry, persecution, astonishment, curmudgeonliness, haughtiness, and chattiness, among others.15 All the images in Monkey Portraits depend on and stage "sympa thetic" identification?identification predicated on biological similarity that the viewer reads as emotional similarity. Greenberg's conceptual frame work does not change for Bear Portraits; anthropomorphizing bears is still the goal. But the ursine face and body and the constraining cultural myths about wild bears combine to complicate anthropomorphized repre sentation across a wide spectrum of behavior and "emotion." Brunner explains the problem thus: [D]etermining a bear's state of mind from its facial expression is close to impossible. Aside from reptiles and most types of birds, bears are among the least expressive of land animals. The bear's largely immobile face remains a mask to human observers, revealing little about the animal's mental state. Only movements of the bear's ears, eyes, and highly flexible nose offer clues to its mood? attentiveness, interest, or fear... its stump tail limits the vocabulary of gestures the bear can perform... A notable change occurs only when the animal opens its mouth to yawn or roar, and it is rare for it to bare its teeth. (129) Cultural and biological circumstances contribute to two major subsets of images within the Bear Portraits series. The first set, images of ferocious bears, intersects differently with anthropomorphism than the images in Monkey Portraits. The second set?images of sad, noble, happy, and sexy bears?relies on and produces the same kind of petishism operative in Monkey Portraits. The photographs of bears posed in stances meant to evoke terror visually manifest the relations of fear inscribed within and constantly reproduced by the Latin name assigned to the grizzly bear by naturalist George Urd in 1814: Ursus horribilis. This name, Brunner notes, stands out as unusually negative by the standards of taxonomic nomenclature (14). Of the forty photographs that comprise the Ursine series (as of this writing), eight of them feature bears in stances where the open mouths and</page><page sequence="12">656 jac bared teeth are meant to induce terror. If the information Brunner presents above is biologically accurate, these images, which comprise twenty per cent of the series, represent Greenberg's adherence to cultural attitudes that represent bears as ferocious and deadly beasts. "Untitled #6," for instance, frames the head of a brown bear in three-quarter profile. Its head thrusts away from its shoulders, its eyes are narrowed, the nostrils are fully flared, and its mouth is fully open, exposing a pink tongue mottled by purple gray and long front teeth. "Untitled #27" also captures the head and shoulders of the bear, though this time the bear looks almost directly into the camera and what appears to be saliva coats part of its bottom lip and the hairs just below its mouth. Of all the bears-in-fierce-stances images, "Untitled #17" makes the most of the visual rhetoric of terror. In this photograph, the full body of the brown bear fills the frame. It stands on its hind legs, a stance that makes apparent all of its impressive bulk and musculature and the amount of damage it could do to a human. Like the two images described above, its mouth is fully open. In this photograph, however, the tongue is not the point of visual interest, as it is in "Untitled #6." Rather, the teeth stand out as the focal point, their shape in marked contrast to the dark brown fur and the cavern of the mouth. Greenberg's images of "ferocious" bears relate to the anthropomorphic operations discussed above and immediately below contiguously rather than congru ently. In other words, the viewer of these photographs does not posit that the bear feels terror. Rather, the image of the bear standing on its legs, open-mouthed and tooth-baring provokes fright in the viewer. In these images, then, the affective economy is one of terrible sublimity, not anthropomorphic identification.16 The rest of the images in Bear Portraits return to the anthropomor phic mold on display in Monkey Portraits. "Untitled #10," which Greenberg has described as featuring a "sad bear," frames a seated black bear whose comportment?hunched shoulders and body supported by front paws placed on the ground, head pointed toward the floor, eyes downcast, no obvious interaction with the camera or viewer?reads as dejected.17 "Untitled #13" proposes the bear as a majestic and noble creature; this bear is positioned in a pose of seeming sincerity and solemnity, facing directly toward the camera with its right paw positioned over its heart as it if were taking a solemn oath or saying the pledge of</page><page sequence="13">Nicole Merola 657 allegiance, a loyal bear companion. Greenberg's cluster of ostensibly happy and often smiling bears functions, at one level, to balance the presence of the ferocious bears. The young brown bear in "Untitled #57," showing only the head and shoulders and directly facing the camera, has a slightly open mouth. But it shows no teeth and appears rather to be engaged in companionable conversation with the viewer. The most jovial of the ostensibly happy bears, "Untitled #8," features a brown bear, framed from the shoulders up. Its round ears appear perky, its head is cocked slightly to the side, and it sports a plesant smile in which the viewer catches only the tiniest hint of tooth. All of these visual elements combine to present the bear as approachable. The bear in this photograph, along with those in "Untitled #18," "Untitled #22," "Untitled #19," "Untitled #30," and "Untitled #24," among others, clearly refer to a recognizable cultural category?namely, the teddy bear. Different varieties of sexy bear appear in several photographs, for example, the photograph with which the essay opened, "Untitled #47" (coquette); in "Untitled #20" (sexually ravenous vixen approaching on all fours); in "Untitled #4" (artsy boudoir shot); and in "Untitled #25" (downcast come-hither glance). Although the smiling and sexy bears do fit into the rubric of anthropomor phic representation, these images also possess a subtext I will consider in the next section of the essay.18 Given the ways in which they traffic in affect, Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits would seem to be perfect examples of visual studies scholar Akira Mizuta Lippit's formulation of the "electric animal": an animal caught up in and within forms of "modern technological media" like photography and cinema (1). In coining this phrase, which fuses the technological and natural, Lippit emphasizes the way in which electric animals have undergone a "transfer" from "nature to technology" (23). The most critical aspect of electric animals for Lippit is their nature as "instruments of dissemination," their inability to "determin[e] or regulat[e] the discourse they put forth." That is, Lippit's electric animal "simply transmit[s]," serves as a relay point for the circulation and transmission of affect (21). Summarizing how Lippit's electric animal works, animal studies and cultural studies scholar Nicole Shukin writes that the figure of the electric animal transforms animals into "synonyms for a communica bility that is spontaneous rather than mediated" (133).</page><page sequence="14">658 jac When the viewer begins, however, to more carefully investigate all the elements of Greenberg's animal portraits, it becomes clear that these animals do not "simply," or naturally, transmit. The "emotion" the monkeys, apes, and bears seem to display is neither natural nor spontane ous. The critical viewer who looks at the images long enough to start considering their artifice realizes that no electric animals exist here. Everything about these images is highly mediated; they are shot through with the residue of the labor that artifice indexes. Whereas the previous reading of Greenberg's animal portraits brack ets their artificiality to represent the contours of an uncritically anthropo morphic engagement, the remainder of the article investigates the enabling material conditions of the photographs in order to suggest how a critical eye can pry them open. To take one example of artifice, smiles on bears (which make these bears look much too creepy to be considered teddy bears) are only the most obvious index for how the "emotion" in Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits is, literally, constructed. In the discussion below, I will suggest that the presence of these unnatural elements offers an opportunity for the critical viewer to advance toward a more ethical form of engagement with the animal subjects in Greenberg's photographs. More specifically, the presence of obvious artifice, when not ignored by the viewer, can forestall anthropomorphic projection and move the viewer toward a relation in which animal bodies and labor move to the foreground. In other words, the artifice of the images (their obviously manipulated quality) operates to deny the naturalness of anthropomorphism and forces the formulation of other ontologies. In reading the artifice of the photo graphs this way, the viewer works against the sentiment that anthropomor phism is unproblematic, which is conveyed by both Greenberg's photo graphs and her attitudes toward her animal subjects. In the discussion to follow, I focus on how the critical viewer can use artifice as a point at which to pressure these images back onto themselves so that they pass "judgment on the behavior of their genetic cousins," more specifically on the inter iorizing anthropomorphizing practices of humans.19</page><page sequence="15">Nicole Merola 659 Better Beauty Through Digital and Material Labor As a way of entering the discussion about devising and practicing a more ethical form of engagement with the animal subjects in Greenberg's photographs, I want to briefly return to the mechanism of petishism so as to sketch the ways in which it depends on a precisely engineered emptiness: although the animal subject is obviously present in the frame, the scenario and circumstances by which the animal's presence becomes possible are purposefully excluded. That is, the images are evacuated of their situatedness within an economy of animal and human labor and human technology. Thus, the "emotion" writ on the face and body of each animal seems universal and timelessly fixed; it insinuates, falsely, the illusion of a "painless transmission" of affect.20 In petishism as Friedberg defines it and as Laura Marks deploys the concept, the projection of emotion onto animals displaces the human fear that nonhuman animals might be simultaneously the same as and different from humans. As Marks notes, for western urban humans who "have the luxury of distance that permits idealizing identification [with animals]," petishism arises from anxieties about species difference and fears about animality; its primal scene "is the terror of finding out that we are not, after all, so different from animals" (26). In Greenberg's work the avowal-disavowal of petishism revolves more narrowly around the axis of emotion. To wit, her images record similarity of facial and bodily expression between human and nonhuman animals, and thereby galvanize our fervent desire to project human emotion onto Greenberg's animal subjects. But this anthropo morphic projection represses our fear and constructs a bulwark against the possibility that the similarity of expression and comport ment we see does not mean that we experience feeling and cognition in the same way as Greenberg's animal subjects. In other words, viewers give in to the tendency to anthropomorphize in part to stave off fear that nonhuman animals might in fact be inaccessible to us. In Greenberg's work, anthropomorphism also allows the viewer to side step the conclusion that must be logically drawn from the artifice of the photographs: the scene of "emotion" within the frame is carefully constructed. Even as the images provoke anthropomorphism and petishism, then, the emptiness within the frames of the photographs</page><page sequence="16">660 jac haunts the viewer and spectrally points to the material circumstances that enable its production. Undertaking a materialist analysis of the circulation of bodies and labor that underwrites Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits is one way to enact visual studies scholar Steve Baker's assertion: when animal art is the object under scrutiny, examining the activity outside the frame of the artwork is as valuable as examining the content within (Picturing 218). Such analysis also moves the viewer toward another type of human animal ontology, one that privileges the enabling materiality and material practices behind the images in order to recuperate the animal subjects as actors rather than representations or vehicles for anthropomorphic projec tion. In this section of the essay, the term "actor" possesses two valences. First, it refers to the common connotation of being a paid performer. Second, it references the work of sociologist Bruno Latour and other practitioners of science studies who have tirelessly worked to extend our concept of who (and what) counts as an active agent. One element of Latour's methodology, which informs the section below, is to track the ways in which all actors?whether animal, vegetable, mineral, or atomic? are inherently situated in multiple material networks.21 In what follows, then, I will explore intertwining material networks of nonhuman animal matter, human technology, human labor, and nonhuman animal labor, which all must converge for Greenberg's animal portraits to develop fully. In Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times, Nicole Shukin reminds us that the figure of the electric animal, the animal encrypted in contemporary technological media, is "actually based" on the "carnal medium of animal flesh" (138). The film stock that makes possible the development of both still and moving images depends on animal matter, on a gelatin emulsion coating derived from animal bodies. Samuel E. Sheppard notes that gelatin is a product of "animal origin, the result of the action of hot water or steam upon certain tissues and structures of the body. . . . The actual material consists of the leavings of tanneries and slaughter-houses?i.e., trimmings, so-called skips, ears, cheek-pieces, pates, fleshings, etc."22 Although camera and film technologies have certainly changed since 1873, when gelatin was first adapted for photog raphy, gelatin emulsion is still central to the practice of photography. Exploring the technological support of film makes it clear that animal</page><page sequence="17">Nicole Merola 661 content affixed onto photographic paper for the consumption of human viewers depends literally on animal matter and animal labor. So a terrible and cannibalistic irony adheres to films and photographs of animals, for the technology of film stock marks "a transfer of life from animal body to technological media [that] passes virtually without notice" (Shukin 104). Thus, what Shukin calls a "pathological relationship" exists within and underwrites all filmic representations of animals: to offer the animal on film necessitates the presence of gelatinous animal parts in the film stock (108). Consequently, relying on film stock and digital printing techniques impli cates Greenberg's animal images in what Shukin calls a "contradictory contingency on animal disassembly" (108). Making clear how the repre sentation of animals on film depends on the literal disassembly of animal bodies foregrounds the ways in which Greenberg's images simultaneously circulate in two global markets. That is, the global market for photographic images (fine art and commercial) relies on its shadow market: global trade in the actual material of animal tissues and structures.23 Contemporary photography hinges upon the presence of animal matter (in the form of gelatin) and light (natural or artifical); without these elements an image will not develop. Gelatin, as Shukin's investigation shows, occupies the curious position of being a transparent but absolutely necessary technological support. Lighting, in the case of Monkey Por traits and Bear Portraits, occupies an analogously curious position. It is everywhere present as a central feature of Greenberg's style, and yet she treats the specific lighting array she uses as proprietary information. Although Greenberg herself remains mum regarding the exact configura tion of her lighting equipment, blogger "The Strobist" deduces that Greenberg's lighting arrangement for Ursine includes "[t] wo big brollies, ringlight, twin back/rimlights, an overhead beauty dish, and a background light." As Russell Hart explains, the rimlight or backlight (also called a "hair light") is standard equipment for portrait photographers, in part because it outlines the subject with a fringe of light and with "glancing highlights." The ringlight, a flash that encircles the lens of the camera, fully illuminates the subject, filling in detail that directional lighting might otherwise render in shadow. Greenberg's equipment results in crisp hard light, which makes the manipulations she does in Photoshop a bit easier to accomplish than would be the case with soft diffused light.24 Despite this</page><page sequence="18">662 jac secrecy, however, the eyes of some of Greenberg's animal subjects archive identifiable traces of particular light sources. For this technological trace, see especially the following portraits: "Pensive," "Offput," "Rocky Portrait," "The Curmudgeon," "Anxious," "Little Screamer," and "Wel come to Your Fascist Future." The eyes of the animals in "Uncle," "The Misanthrope," and "Baby Monkey," "Shemp," and "The Hatchling" record multiple lighting sources. Some photographs in Bear Portraits bear inscriptions of light sources as well, but due to the size of the eyes in these images, the exact kind of lighting is more difficult to discern. The visual archive of lighting technology performs two functions. First, it belies the aphorism about eyes being the windows to the souls of creatures; in these instances the eyes become a location where any inclination to use the eye as the site for the naturalization of emotion is undercut by the revelation of a trace of the work it took to set up and compose the shot. Second, the traces call into the frame, rather than effacing, the network of technologies (including humans) upon which the images depend. Thus, these traces of light source contain multiple elements of photographic history and practice. Light sources evocatively assemble all the developments in lighting that lead to the kind of array Greenberg utilizes as well as all the inventors, corporate histories, factories and materials, and people it takes to make the lights themselves. They also implicate the presence of assistants who set up the array before Greenberg arrives in the studio. Analogous networks accrue to the camera and film that Greenberg uses on set, and to the computer, Wacom tablet, and software that Greenberg uses in postproduction. Although the method of discerning and describing material networks extends to all enabling elements and processes, the few examples included above will suffice to reveal the images as objects engendered by multiple circulations of material and labor. Once the images are developed, Greenberg applies additional labor in the form of digital manipulation. To make bears register anthropomorphi cally, especially those who sport smiles, Greenberg has to work harder than she did with the monkeys and apes. She acknowledges the additional labor necessary for Bear Portraits during one filmed interview when she says "a few of the bears are a little bit more manipulated than the monkeys or the children."25 In particular, ursine eyes stymied Greenberg, as a Cool</page><page sequence="19">Nicole Merola 663 Hunting Video interview reveals. In one portion of the video, shot at Greenberg's studio in Los Angeles, she sits at her computer clicking through and discussing the content of and techniques used in some of her images. Just before the image of a brown bear whose eyes have yellow sclera and black pupils displays onscreen, Greenberg says, "This one I put black panther eyes in. I like those." She chuckles and then, in reference to another image (a bear whose eyes look more like human eyes than panther eyes) she remarks, "Because the bears have such small eyes I thought it' d be fun to switch their eyes. It' s a very silly Photoshop trick but it looks cool."26 Implied in her comments here and explicit in an interview with Russell Hart is the idea that ocular manipulation is also supposed to make the bears seem more "sympathetic" ("Loaded" 122). The first image from this part of the video did not make it into the final series of forty images, perhaps because the panther eyes make the bear look bizarre, not sympathetic or terrifying. In fact, the panther-ursine ocular swap must not have been either aesthetically or anthropomorphically pleasing to Greenberg, for none of the final images contain those feline eyes. Although the second bear image described above is also absent from the final series, its almost human eyes appear in some of the Bear Portraits, evincing the fact that Greenberg does clearly perform some manipulations to ursine eyes in her attempt to make bears productive sites for anthropomorphic projection. In some images, the eyes of the bear are clearly engineered, either through species-swapping that Greenberg has not discussed or through digital manipulation that changes the ratio of iris to sclera. Two ofthe polar bear photographs, "Untitled #9" and "Untitled #53," make this ocular hybridization especially apparent. In the former photograph, the polar bear faces the camera directly, with eyes that are almost black and possess no sclera. These are eyes we would recognize as biologically accurate. In the latter photograph, the bear's eyes are noticeably different: light brown, containing a clear black iris, with significant sclera showing. Although the bear in "Untitled #53" looks to the right side of the frame, not directly at the camera, this difference in the direction of the gaze cannot by itself account for the difference in the way the eyes look. These two photo graphs, therefore, demonstrate what Greenberg's ocular hybridization looks like. The bear in the photograph described at the beginning of this article contains the same kind of eyes as the polar bear in "Untitled #53."</page><page sequence="20">664 jac This manipulation, which alludes to a sidelong glance that might precede flirtation, has the effect of making the bears seem coy. One thing ocular hoodwinkery tells us is that Greenberg consciously recognizes the impor tance of the eye of the animal in fostering empathetic connection across species boundaries.27 But as she notes on camera, ocular manipulation also makes the bear "look cool" to her. Greenberg's assessment of this practice, which focuses on the aesthetic, fails to recognize the way in which it also indexes the hubris rampant in contemporary biogenetics and is therefore a visually recorded instantiation of one form of biopower?in this case, human control over animals to the extent that we can swap out their parts. Greenberg's ocular experimentation brings together the anthropo morphism discussed at length above with another equally important conceptual framework that undergirds her work: aesthetics. Her obses sion with the aesthetics of the image simultaneously evinces a marked disinterest in, even a disavowal of, the specific animalities of her nonhuman subjects. Greenberg explicitly vocalizes the fact that her primary commit ments are aesthetic (not animal) in remarks about the images in Bear Portraits: "I'm going for something very perfected and painterly. . . . Basically I just sort of highlight their fur, and enhance the gradations and the light, and I just make them . . . more beautiful, I mean to me more beautiful. I mean I'm not a purist so I'm ultimately after making a really great image" (Arts &amp; Minds). In these comments about the photographs, which are responses to questions posed by an off-camera interviewer as Greenberg walks through a gallery where images from End Times and Ursine are on display, Greenberg first reduces her ursine subject to a texture?fur?valued primarily in these images as a vehicle for showcas ing her signature digital technique. Then, she discursively renders the ursine subject as the abstract aesthetic category of the beautiful. At the end of her response to the interviewer, Greenberg effaces the ursine subject altogether by indicating that the production of "a really great image"?a commodity that can circulate through galleries, into the homes of collectors, and in the form of books on coffee tables everywhere? functions as her ultimate goal. Her disinterest in her subjects as animals qua animals is further emphasized in her remarks that she pays "them as models to show up and perform for me" (Arts &amp; Minds). Through the use</page><page sequence="21">Nicole Merola 665 of the term models Greenberg nullifies all species difference among and between those she has photographed. If this quotation were taken out of its context, a response to a question about the bears of Ursine, it could apply equally to the children featured in End Times or the monkeys and apes of Monkey Portraits. In other words, the children, the monkeys and apes, and the bears all exist in the same relation to Greenberg: paid performers. Greenberg's troublingly uncritical relationship to the paid performativity of her animal subjects is further indicated by her blithe framing of the "sexy" portraits, "Mala Centerfold" (from Monkey Portraits) and the four photographs from Ursine referenced above ("Untitled #47," "Un titled #20," "Untitled #4," and "Untitled #25"). Her comments comprise a framing of these photographs that is both playfully quirky and willfully naive. For instance, her comments about discovering that yellow baboon Mala could adopt a "pin-up pose" are absolutely gleeful.28 Having realized the titillating potential of the "sexy" animal image with Mala, Greenberg, during a shoot with one of the polar bears, looks to replicate the mood, and asks the trainer "Can we get this polar bear to look sexy?" (Flora 40). Greenberg seems content to rely on seeing the images as breezily provocative, for she never articulates their disturbing subtext: nonhuman animals made to bear the burden of the guise of human sexuality. Given the conceptual logic of the two series, the "sexy" photographs should be special candidates for anthropomorphic projection. However, these par ticular images have the unintended and ironic effect of short-circuiting anthropomorphism because of their very "sexiness." Mapping human sexuality onto nonhuman animals opens a possible opening to bestiality that human taboo forcefully forecloses. At the same time, these images disturb because we see courtship poses revealed as the performances they are and because we see on the bodies of other animals courtship behaviors we want to believe are restricted to the human. While we certainly allow that all animals possess reproductive capacity, affording them aspects of human sexuality is altogether another story. Aside from two traces of technology?the lighting fixtures recorded in the eyes of some of the primates and bears and the obvious results of digital manipulation?all other labor of human and nonhuman animals is everywhere implied but nowhere visible in the frame. For instance, while</page><page sequence="22">666 jac the monkeys and apes in Monkey Portraits appeared at Greenberg's studio in order to be photographed, the photographs in Bear Portraits were shot in Calgary and Vancouver, in outdoor studios built and sited expressly for the bears. Unless the viewer excavates this information, the similarity of the background across all the photographs erases the differences in locations and behind-the-scenes labor required for each session in each series.29 A related form of erasure attends the work of the animal handlers, who receive only the briefest mentions: a blanket thanks in the acknowledgments at the back of Monkey Portraits to "[a]ll of the animal agencies and trainers who made these sittings possible" and a similar statement in the acknowledgements of Bear Portraits. Animal work history and the work of the trainers is revealed only in materials ancillary to the photographs. The particular labor histories of each animal are not apparent in the images, nor are the training techniques or stimuli used to coax the animals into particular poses. The photographs in Monkey Portraits are captioned only by their titles; the photographs in Bear Portraits are all untitled. To discover the given names, species names, and work histories of the monkeys and apes and bears featured in the images one must to turn to the "Who's Who" at the end of each book. Moving from the images to the end matter, one will find a few animals with no work history: the simians Forest, Chitta, Abbey, Azumah, Lola, and Moe are identified only by given name, species name, and residence. All of the other monkeys, apes, and bears have worked in entertainment (television and film) and advertising (print and television commercials). Although none of the animals in Monkey Portraits are former scientific research subjects, the very presence of animals trained to do the bidding of humans recalls all the other ways in which primates have been made instruments to serve human interests. The work of critical interrogation that reminds the viewer about both specific and more general work histories of primates and bears functions to replace an economy of seemingly natural affect with one comprised instead by acting, laboring bodies. The work of the trainers and handlers is even further removed from the images than the work histories of the animals. Only an archaeology of film and print interviews makes their labor visible and reveals how what seems to be emotion is in fact, as the following examples demonstrate, the</page><page sequence="23">Nicole Merola 667 response of a trained animal to particular stimuli. In one interview, Greenberg confesses to a delicious irony that attends the photographs where the bears appear to be delivering hair-raising roars. On the set these moments are oddly silent, for the bears are trained to replicate stances they might employ in the wild (and stances humans would read as terrifying or aggressive) without making any noise (Hart "Loaded" 122). In video footage taken while Greenberg was on set shooting a brown bear in Calgary, one can see the bear's trainer, standing next to Greenberg, holding a spoonful of food near Greenberg's head. This particular stimulus helped produce "Untitled #46," one of the photographs meant to signify terror, and an unpublished photograph in which the bear sports a serene smile. The shots that become these images occur within seconds of each other. Later in this same video, Greenberg reveals the invisible presence of the human hand of the trainer in "The Hatchling." She notes that in this photograph a "little tiny baby white capuchin" is "being held by his trainer while I was photographing him. That actually might have been a shot that I did when he was hanging upside down from his trainer, from the guy's hand" {Cool Hunting). But the viewer of the photograph has no idea what keeps the capuchin in place for its portrait, or whether it is right side up or upside down, for only the head and shoulders of the monkey appear in the frame. Greenberg employs the same framing technique for eight of the nine mandrill portraits, where it is necessary because "the imposing monkeys were chained around the waist to prevent mishaps" (Grant). The Arts &amp; Minds video reveals that the bears were chained as well. Since chains appear in neither "Monkey Suit," the one portrait where the viewer sees the mandrill Kongo's entire body, nor in any of the images in Bear Portraits, Greenberg has obviously used digital manipulation to excise this particular training prosthetic, thereby expunging any evidence that the photographs might not be instances of "painless transmission."30 As the chained mandrills and bears indicate, Greenberg does ac knowledge the potential dangers to humans of photographing trained animals. Referring to baby monkeys she remarks they can be "total crazy little freaks" that run away and bite their handlers. Adult orangutans, she notes, are difficult to get because "they' re pretty dangerous usually." But, she also brushes off the danger, remarking that the orangutan Jake, one of her favorites, was "really pretty well trained and he was pretty funny,</page><page sequence="24">668 jac he's such a character" (Cool Hunting). While the training of these animals may well be first-rate, Greenberg's recuperation of Jake from "pretty dangerous" to "a funny character" attempts to dispel the uncanny, nagging sense that no digital manipulation, silently roaring bear, or chained mandrill can fully repress. Even though these images might propose a fantasy of safe engagement, the 2003 mauling of illusionist Roy Horn by his trained white tiger Montecore, the 2009 mauling of a Connecticut woman by her friend's fourteen-year old pet chimpanzee Travis, and the 2010 death of Sea World Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was pulled into the water and drowned by the orca Tilikum, remind us about what we know but often suppress: trained animals can just as easily sidestep their discipline as act within it. Without minimizing the tragic results to humans of attacks by trained animals, I want to emphasize that suchevents also represent for the nonhuman animals a recovered agency, perhaps even the operation of a "prion politics" wherein the "undisci plined" behavior of the nonhuman actor forces us to confront their living conditions and our own complicity in producing those conditions.31 Somatic Conclusions When we restore the material body to Greenberg's animal subjects, both by unearthing the way in which contemporary photography is predicated on animal matter and by bringing labor into the foreground, we are able to step away from anthropomorphism and instead inhabit a new ontology of relationship. The picture plane of Greenberg's images, in offering artifici ality as an index for bodies and labor, allows us to emphasize the relationship of somaticity animating the encounter between human viewer and animal subject. That is, the viewer can move from the tendency to project interiorizing anthropomorphic emotion onto the monkeys, apes, and bears of the photographs and instead occupy a space of embodied affinity. Relating to "Untitled #10" via embodied affinity, for example, would recover the bear from its apparent sadness and concentrate instead, in non-aestheticizing fashion, on its form?the shape of its entire body, the length of its muzzle, the contrast between the color of its dark fur and its tan muzzle and paw pads. The viewer would also notice the shape of the</page><page sequence="25">Nicole Merola 669 bear's hind paws, which are emphasized by the aforementioned contrast in color between pad and fur. From the perspective of embodied affinity, the bear in "Untitled #17," rather than being a vehicle for the provocation of terrible sublimity, becomes an indication of homological proximity between human and ursine; though its chest muscles, incisors, claws, and limbs might be sized differently than the pectorals, canines, fingernails, and limbs ofhumans, the general similarity in bodies is striking. Non-interiorizing space of embodied affinity exists for monkeys and apes as well. In the case of "Monkey Suit," for instance, such a relation would forego reading the image through the epigram and would focus instead on colors of fur, on facial structure, on fangs. When we turn to the body?or, more specifically, to the element of embodiment as a shared aspect of human and nonhuman animal life?we follow a growing trend in animal studies and generate an ontology through which to repudiate the long tradition within Continental philosophy that positions the nonhuman animal as somehow impoverished.32 This focus on embodiment should not be read as biologically reductive or essentialist, even though it does link human and nonhuman animals through their essentially biological natures. Rather, the contemporary critical turn to embodiment as deployed in animal studies seeks, in part, to replace the interiorizing nature of anthropomorphic and other extensionist ways of situating animals vis-a-vis humans. Different articulations of the contours of embodied affinity exist, but the three noted below, taken together, have informed this essay's model for how to engage in a non-anthropomorphic encounter with the animal subject in Monkey Portraits and Ursine. The position held by Thomas Nagel referred to earlier?that embodiment and cognition are inextricably linked and prevent us from ever knowing how another species experiences the world?is an inflection derived from meditation on the mind-body problem; such theorizing cautions the viewer against the projections of anthropomorphism by suggesting their logical impossibility. Stanley Cavell would call this a formulation of the position of "underknowing." Yet another way of articulating this kind of relationality comes from Donna Haraway, who writes that being "companion species" involves the maintenance of a relationship of "significant otherness"; that is, creatures in a cross-species companion relationship remain significant to, while simultaneously significantly other than, each other. Also impor</page><page sequence="26">670 jac tant to the conception of companion species is the fact that both parties to the relationship have co-evolutionary effects on each other. The concept of "symphysis," which philosopher Ralph Acampora develops into a particular form of phenomenological approach to engagement with the nonhuman other, provides another piece for puzzling through the construc tion of cross-species connections not based in interiority or emotionalization. For Acampora, symphysis is "the sense of sharing with somebody else a somaesthetic nexus experienced through a direct or systemic (inter)relationship. In this way the concept comes to signify a pattern of more densely physical orientation?i.e. by contrast to the more airy, psychic notion of sympathy frequently utilized by moral sense theorists."33 This articulation of symphysis, which one can experience even when not in direct contact with the nonhuman other, extends the possibility of ethical encounter to the realm of representational media. In other words, it helps explain why the picture plane can be a significant locus for ethical engagement across species boundaries. Articulating the ethical param eters of "the densely physical orientation" inherent in any moment of encounter between creatures, as the phenomenological approach does, needs to be supplemented by materialist analysis that brings to the foreground the networks in which all encounter is situated. In the case of Greenberg's images, materialist analysis reveals that the somaesthetic nexus inhabited by both the human viewer and nonhuman animal subject is generated by the shared condition of material labor. Thus, each participant in the process of producing and consuming Monkey Portraits and Ursine?human and nonhuman animals alike?is revealed as an actor who contributes something essential to the encounter. Positionality, not emotion, undergirds all aspects of this model of ethical engagement. In coming to inhabit a relationship based on position and not projection, the viewer supplants the hubris of believing one can know what another animal feels and instead activates the condition of significant otherness in relation to the monkeys, apes, and bears in Greenberg's portraits.

In the discussion that follows all references to Monkey Portraits are to the 2006 book, which is unpaginated. References to Greenberg's portraits of bears take two forms. Ursine designates the series of sixty-six bear portraits on Greenberg's website and also various gallery exhibitions of the bear photographs prior to 2009. Bear Portraits designates the unpaginated 2009 book. Bear Portraits contains two images not archived on the website and the Ursine archive contains three images not published in the book. Since all of Greenberg's bear photographs are untitled, references to these portraits will utilize the unique identification numbers Greenberg has assigned to each portrait on her website. Her numbering schema involves two different sets of numbers, one that identifies the portrait's place in the series of sixty-six as currently configured on the website, and one that uniquely identifies the portrait. To identify photographs for the purposes of this article, in the body I will use the formulation "Untitled #N," where N is the place the photograph occupies in the series. The unique identifier for each portrait (nn-nn) will appear in the footnotes. 3. In the afterword to Monkey Portraits, Myoda does characterize the process of looking at the portraits as "at once frightening and disorienting and exhilarating and awesome" (n. pag.). But, he does not elaborate regarding what, exactly, produces unease. 4. This is the apocryphal story in circulation. Under the publications link on herwebsite, Greenberg claims that a German art magazine from the 1980s provided the inspiration for the name. 5. In addition to the photograph used by The Atlantic, Greenberg posted outtakes from the shoot to her website. In one photograph she has lit McCain from below. He stands close to a sallow background with his shadow projected behind and looming over him. Greenberg has digitally manipulated this image to give</page><page sequence="28">672 jac McCain a set of bloody shark teeth and a long tongue that reaches to the upper lip to lick blood that surrounds the mouth. To this admittedly (and purposefully) disturbing image, she has added the words "I am a Bloodthirsty Warmonger." Another photograph borrows material from her stock of simian shots to construct an image in which a monkey appears to be defecating on McCain's head. See bumpshack, Colberg, Goldberg, Lang, Sensico, Tucker, and Walker for assess ments of the McCain photographs and the ensuing controversy about them. Greenberg also uses her work to support other liberal causes, such as the fight against global warming; she recently donated one of her polar bear photographs to advertise a "Danger Global Warming Project" event in Brooklyn ("Green Bomb"). For this particular polar bear image, which clearly plays with the iconic status of polar bears as the charismatic megafauna through which humans can index the effects of global warming, see the "Exhibitions/Events" section of her website. Greenberg also utilizes the polar bear to symbolize the detrimental effects of global warming in two photographs in Bear Portraits, which feature crying polar bears and clearly echo the crying children and the political sentiments present in End Times. 6. See especially Jaschinski's Zoo and Noelker's Captive Beauty: Zoo Portraits. 7. See, for instance, Calarco, Kalof, Kalof and Fitzgerald, and Wolfe. 8. This term "underknowing" comes from a letter written by Stanley Cavell to Vicki Hearne and is quoted in both Hearne's book Adam's Task and Cary Wolfe's book Animal Rites. Wolfe glosses CavelPs formulation of underknowing this way: "Cavell asks us to 'understand' the animal?'underknow' her and thereby stand 'under,' not above her?by surrendering the dream of mastery troped as vision_Cavell underscores that our stance toward an animal is an index for how we stand in a field of otherness and difference generally, and in some ways it is the most reliable index, the 'hardest case' of our readiness to be vulnerable to other knowledges in our embodiment of our own" (5). With respect to Greenberg's animal portraits, it is mastery troped as anthropomorphic projec tion from which underknowing turns away. 9. Whereas Crist absolutely defends the positive nature of the kinds of anthropomorphism deployed in the work of Charles Darwin, George and Elizabeth Peckham, and Jean Henri Fabre, Serpell's celebration of anthropomorphism is more circumspect. He writes, "[f]rom an animal welfare perspective, however, the effects of anthropomorphism are far less benign. Anthropomorphic selection? that is, selection in favor of physical and behavioral traits that facilitate the attribution of human mental states to animals?imposes unusual and unique pressures on the objects of its attention, in much the same way that the phenomenon of'female choice' does in sexual selection-many companion animal breeds have become effectively crippled or handicapped by selection for traits that appeal to our anthropomorphic perceptions" (129).</page><page sequence="29">Nicole Merola 673 10. Quoted in Marks 25-26. As Marks explains, Friedberg's formulation of the concept of petishism "draws from Christian Metz's psychoanalytic account of filmic identification to argue that dogs are open to projection and fetishization in a way similar to the cinema screen. The screen is a space in which viewers can identify with an image that is not of them?the screen is not a mirror?but confirms their existence and reflects back on them" (25). 11. Two photographs in Bear Portraits have a plain white background; visually the effect of this background is much less rich, and less successful, than the backgrounds employed for all the other photos in Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits. 12. The layout of each epigram in Monkey Portraits is the same. Except for the title of the photograph, it is the only text and is centered on the page facing the portrait. The function of each is the same as well: part witticism, part caption, and part framing device. See, for instance, Elias Canetti's comment, "Whenever you observe an animal closely, you feel as if a human being sitting inside were making ftm of you" (n. pag.), which faces the portrait of mandrill Kongo titled "Monkey Suit," and a lyric taken from a Beck song, "In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey" (n. pag.), which faces "The Monkey," a photograph of the capuchin Katie. The epigrams in Bear Portraits perform the same framing function as they do in Monkey Portraits. To wit, this epigram, "Only the gentle are ever really strong" (n. pag.), credited to James Dean, faces the photograph of Kodiak bear Betty looking sedately noble. 13. Primate 2.

Although the images in Bear Portraits are officially untitled, on the Guy Hepner Contemporarywebsite each image has an attached description. Whether these descriptions come from Greenberg or are assigned by the gallery to help market the images is unclear. Germane is the anthropomorphic nature of many of the descriptions. 18. The unique identification numbers for the photographs discussed in this paragraph are, in order of reference, (88K-41), (751-48), (A26-11), (901-41),</page><page sequence="30">674 jac (43-6), (49F-54), (56F^5), (41 -2), (39F-41), (1A17-2), (56-9), (951-47), and (37F-53). 19. Here I extend the meaning of this line of Greenberg's, which comes from the introduction to Monkey Portraits. As her already cited comment about choosing photographs because of their anthropomorphism demonstrates, it is not anthropomorphism she finds problematic. Indeed, anthropomorphism is, for Greenberg, a catalyst for both fame and fortune and, occasionally, political comment. Her remarks in the introduction pertain to photographs such as "Persecuted," "Headache," "Kenuzy Scream," "Little Screamer," "Falling Sky," and, especially, "Welcome to Your Fascist Future." The titles of these images signify, echoing those of End Times, as frustration with the policies and practices in place during the administrations of George W. Bush. 20. See Davies for a discussion of digitally "fixing" animals in the context of the electronic zoo. The phrase "painless transmission" comes from Regis Debray, who makes the following argument in Media Manifestos: "No more than there is any innocent medium can there be painless transmission (46, qtd. in Shukin 142? 143). The fantasy that telecommunication, and by extension communication via representational media, is immaterial and painless involves what Shukin calls the "disavowal of communication's violent political economies and material condi tions of possibility" (133). To dissolve the fantasty of painless transmission, then, necessitates "strong reference to the world, its materials, its vectors, and its procedures" (Shukin 26). 21. In the glossary of Politics of Nature, Latour defines the term actor/actant in the following way: "Actant is a term from semiotics covering both humans and nonhumans; an actor is an entity that modifies another entity...; of actors it can be said only that they act; their competence is always judged from their performances; the action, in turn, is always recorded" (237). 22. Sheppard 25; qtd. in Shukin 104. 23. See Shukin 111-13 for a discussion of "the global heterogeneity of animal material that Eastman Kodak collected to render into gelatin" (111). Although the archival documents from which Shukin constructs this section cover only the time period from the 1880s to the 1940s, global trade in animal parts continues into the present. 24.

Jill Greenberg: Cool Hunting Video: Episode 63. Hereafter, Cool Hunting. 21. For an assessment of the importance of highlighting animal eyes in contemporary photography, see Kramer's "Digital Beasts as Visual Esperanto." There she argues that the animal photographs of Getty photographer Tim Flach focus on "the visual dynamics of the scene on set, especially any anthropomor phic opportunities it may afford" (155) in order to "convey a sentimental</page><page sequence="31">Nicole Merola 675 education, a schooling for the emotion" (166). The eyes of the animal, which Flach lights so as to produce what he calls "ping" (145), become an especially important component in constructing "emoticons" (145), Kramer's derogatory deployment of the term for the grammar of Flach's too sentimental work. There are important differences between the work of Flach and Greenberg, to be sure. But there is similarity between the two photographers in that each must labor to create his/ her desired visual rhetoric. As Kramer notes in the case of Flach, the light accentuating the eyes of his animals should not be "misconstrued as an 'authen tic' expression of the animal's untamed spirit. The ping is a detail exceedingly difficultto orchestrate and produce" (145). The unique identification numbers for the photographs discussed in the paragraph are, in order of reference, (40-6) and (09-6). 28. Cool Hunting. Greenberg plays the sexy card to her additional advantage by placing the "Mala Centerfold" photograph in a2009 "Intimacy and Seduction" show held at the Madden Museum of Art in Denver. 29. These comments hold for all of Greenberg's simian photographs and for almost all of the ursine photographs. Exceptions include, for instance, the first image in the series of bear portraits on Greenberg's website, "Untitled # 1" (8-11). This image, which also appears in the book Bear Portraits, includes part of the studio set-up in the frame. In the rest of Greenberg's images, she orients the camera toward the back of the set. However, this image affords the viewer a point-of-view diagonal to the studio set. So, while the polar bear occupies most of the frame, on the far left side of the image, in a vertical strip occupying roughly one-quarter of the image, the viewer sees the edge of the set, the grassy site on which the set was constructed, a metal fence that appears to have been temporarily erected around the studio set, and an illuminated light source. And, in "Untitled #2" (a6 2), a human hand bottle-feeds a young brown bear. 3 0.1 do not mean to imply explicit cruelty ever took place at any of Greenberg' s sittings; no evidence in either video suggests that animals were mistreated. But the presence of the chains (and, indeed, all the other stimuli used by trainers to entice particular kinds of performance from the animals) do represent an uneven power dynamic that was historically often accompanied by cruelty. The unique identification number for the photograph discussed in this paragraph is (14B-5 3). 31. Detailed elaborations of "prion politics" can be found in Latour' s Politics ofNature(24,111-14,119) mdShukin's Animal Capital (22S-29). [Editor: Prions are the infectious protein that causes mad cow disease, which exposed the widespread practice of feeding livestock the rendered brains and spinal cords of slaughtered animals. Prions arise from the human-engineered practice of recy cling animal proteins.] 32. In turning to embodiment as a central theoretical principle, this work in animal studies draws, in part, on the turn to materiality in feminist theory. See for instance, Braidotti, Grosz, Alaimo, and Alaimo and Hekman. Haraway has been</page><page sequence="32">676 iaf at the forefront of converging feminist theory and animal studies around the trope of embodiment. See especially The Companion Species Manifesto and When Species Meet. Heidegger's position that animals are poor-in-world is one repre sentative example of the mode of philosophizing that impoverishes nonhuman animals (186-273). For commentary on Heidegger's writing on the nonhuman animalsee,forinstance,Acampora(6-12,27-33,46-47,104,118-20) and Calarco (15-53). 3 3. Acampora 76.
