<plain_text><page sequence="1">Russell and the Great Mystery SURVIVAL AFTER DEATH by E. F. O'DOHERTY TT is fairly obvious that if there is no such thing as "soul ", there can be no such thing as immortality'. One could still argue and reason about the "eternity" of matter but the eternity of matter, either back wards or forwards in time, is irrelevant to the question: do I survive the death of the body The problem of the eternity of the world, in so far as reason can cope with it, can be put very simply. Since God always is, in an eternal nunc, the act of creation of a finite universe (speaking anthropomorphi cally could have occurred at any "point" in God's existence, or could have been " co-terminous " with the existence of God. The fact that this was not the case is not known from reason but from revelation. The possibility of eternity "forwards " in time follows from the difference between transformation and annihilation of matter. Transformations of matter are familiar. Hydrogen and oxygen "become" or are "changed into" water. There is a loss of energy; but it is not simply reduced to nothingness. The energy is taken up by something else. The notion of nothingness is difficult. It is not just a blank surrounded by something else, as one might think when considering the possibility of a perfect vacuum. There is no known instance of "reduction to nothingness" in the physical world, any more than there is of creation. But the loose and inaccurate use of the word "annihilation" in con nection with atomic energy has led the public to think that matter is literally" annihilated " or reduced to nothingness. In fact it is converted into energy, and energy is still a phenomenon of the physical material world. The loose use of " annihilation" is parallelled by the equally loose use of the word "creation ", e.g. by Fred Hoyle, who thinks that matter is being "eternally created" when what he means apparently is that energy is constantly being transformed into "matter ". There is no known instance of annihilation (in the literal sense in the physical universe. Appeals to thermodynamics will not help: entropy may mean the cessation of all movement and change, but it is not the same as "ceasing to be ". Nor does it help to speculate on This article is complementary to "Russell and the Great Mystery" in Studies, Spring 5957. 2cf.

For, once again, the position is that our universe would be converted into something else : energy, perhaps, but I leave that to the physicists. Such an event might be the end of " our world ", but not necessarily the end of " the world ". We must take it that, as far as human reason can penetrate the problem, matter could be eternal. Annihilation is the prerogative of divine power, the correlative of creation. . If it is assumed, as Russell seems to assume, that man is nothing but matter, then his " eternity " will follow from the eternity of matter itself. But of course Russell would agree that his continuity as a person would cease. The continuing in existence of the atoms or particles of which I am composed is not at all the same as my continuing in existence It seems that if Russell wished to be completely consistent, his argument could have been stated in a few sentences : " I am nothing but a collection of elementary particles organized in a particular way. It is manifest that this organization breaks down. But the particles go on existing. This is not immortality. But there is nothing else. Therefore there is no immortality ". But the con300ts of me, ego, self, person, are hard to get rid of Consciousness and mental life are equally difficult to get rid of. Hence the inevitable falling back on a discussion of memory and continuity, rather than a straight statement of the materialist hypothesis. The "reduction" of man to a group of elementary particles or, more generally, the elimination of any difference between living and non-living matter has become a habitual mode of thought with many. Sherrington (Man on His Nature), though he does not subscribe to this doctrine, states it very well. Referring to a well-known passage where Eddington speaks of his table and of his elbow resting on it, Sherrington says True, there is between the elbow and the table the difference that the one is 'living' and the other is dead Chemistry and physics say nothing of this Or rather they say a great deal about it, but do not in saying it make use of either of these words If we tell tben that the table was at one time living wood and is now dead wood, that the wood was at one time part of a living tree, they do not recognize the word as conveying any radical distinction between the two . . . Chemistry says that neither in the one case nor in the other does it find anything or any behaviour which is not chemical And again Pirenne (British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Ii 8 makes an important point "An examination of physics qua physics gives no indication that the new physical laws should not apply to the</page><page sequence="3">164 Studies [SUMMER components of the human body ". But neither does Pirenne ac300t the materialist hypothesis. It would be interesting, but perhaps un profitable, to compile a list of quotations from Eddington, Einstein, Hinsheiwood, Adrian, each of whom in his own way states the problem and rejects the materialist hypothesis, very, often, as with Sherrington, by doing violence to his own scientific thinking. Sherrington is prepared to ac300t the theoretically impossible, as he puts it : that is to say, he ac300ts the physico-chemical account of man, the reality of mind, the impossibility that mind and matter should affect one another, but ac300ts in addition that in fact they do so. This would appear to be the position of many contemporaries-a sort of reversion to an Averroist "double-truth" theory. The way out of the apparent impasse depends on hard philosophical thinking. The impasse derives from what Ryle has called the CC Official Doctrine ", " Descartes' Myth ", " the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine ". This myth he derives not only from Descartes, but also from " Scholastic and Reformation theology ", " Stoic-Augustinian theories of the will", " Platonic and Aristotelian theories of the intellect" (The Con300t of Mind, 1949, page 23). Reasoning better than he realized, he reverted to what is in essence (though not in detail or in the consequences he draws from it a good thomistic con300t of man as one being. St Thomas's problem was not: how is soul as spirit related to a body existing in its own right so that the product is man This was Plato, St Augustine, Scotus, Descartes and I fear many who would even still claim to follow St Thomas's teaching. But rather: given that this being, sitting or standing in front of me, is Socrates, how is it that the following propositions can all be true about him at the same time: he weighs i8o lbs., he is subject to the law of gravity, he grows, he sees, he feels, he thinks In philosophical terms this is the problem how is it that one and the same being can sustain apparently contradictory predicates-he is matter, he is spirit The solution of Plato and the others listed above consisted always in saying there is no contradiction He is reallytwo beings, and some of these predicates are true of one of these beings and the others are true of the other. But St Thomas will have none of thise Perhaps his greatest, but certainly his most controversial, contribution to the philosophy of the middle ages was his rejection, long before Ryle, of the dogma of the ghost in the machine His solution is a psycho-physical composite, neither of whose com ponents is a complete being the same kind of composition which is found in every other creature in the physical universe, a composition between a formal and a material principle But this must not be thought of as a simple combination of"organization" with "elementary</page><page sequence="4">19571 Russell and the Great Myster, 165 particles ". It is a metaphysical union of principles of being. This is not an out-moded solution but a grievously misunderstood one. The theory of elementary particles in no wise upsets it. For if there really are elementary particles, they will be themselves so composed. And if there are not (Schro-dinger apparently thought there were not : see "Are there Elementary Particles ", Endeavour, 1950 ; Brit.Jour. Phil. Science, 1952. Dingle has called them " physical symbols ", and most physicists think of them apparently as con300tual constructions ; but the public does not know this they cannot upset the theory of co-principles of being. It is not my intention to engage in a dispute with modern physics. But a word on this problem may not be out of place here since it is often contended that modern physics, and especially its applications in cybernetics, has radically altered the problems involved in a philosophy of man. It is worth noting that this has not happened through pro nouncements of the great physicists, but rather through the popularized versions which the public has access to. Thus, in spite of many dis claimers on the part of all the great physicists, many still believe the billiard-ball analogy of the atom, and many who would reject this in the case of the atom appear to cling to it still in endeavouring to under stand the elementary particles. It is assumed by many that these particles are durable little things with individuality, and that we are composed of such "little things ". But Schrodinger laid down cate gorically that" (a particle is not a durable little thing with individuality" (Brit. Jour. Phil. Science, According to Max Born, who described this view-point as "reactionary ", Schrodinger has "right from the beginning ", taken the view that "there are no particles, no stationary states, and no transitions" (1953). Schrodinger in fact went even further there are not even "waves "; "The waves are not quite real waves"; CC Whatever meaning we may give to the dangerous epithet 'real', all quantitative models or images conceived by the physicist are, epistemologically, only mathematical devices for computing observable events The explanatory value of elementary particles is of course beyond question, and one can only admire and be grateful to the physicists for their achievements But, in sheer logic, it should be pointed out that a con300t or set of con300ts which "explain something are not thereby shown to have an ontological counterpart Phlogiston and ether are classical examples of con300ts which appeared for a time to" explain" phenomena, but which were subsequently abandoned for lack of any reality corresponding Some "explanatory con300ts" are "logical fictions" Russell instances geometrical points and instants of time, but there are others The cycles and epicycles of Ptolemaic astronomy turned out to be logical fictions, and" the unconscious" in contemporary</page><page sequence="5">166 Studies [SUMMER psychology will be seen on reflection to be a good example of an "ex planatory con300t" which, however convinced one might be of its reality, might turn out to be a logical fiction. For the independent de600stration of its existence turns out to be. "impossible by definition ". It is true that most physicists tend to eschew the Schrodinger articles, but then it is also true that most physicists prescind from any discussion of the "real existence" of elementary particles. Their position appears to be expressible in some such form as this: "Something" exists, and these are the explanatory con300ts which render it intelligible and (to some extent controllable. This statement is in no sense intended as a reflection on physics or physicists, but only to show that, in spite of a priori assumptions to the contrary, the elementary particles do not raise new philosophical problems in the philosophy of man. For it was always clear (ex300t perhaps to panpsychists that the organism is material-so that whatever is true of matter will be true of the organism. The fact that the organism is subject to the law of gravity but that "thought" is not so subject raises the same philosophical problems as are raised by cybernetics or the quantum theory. For the problem is how can this one individual being, man, or Socrates, whose organism is material (whatever matter is), be also at one and the same time a "thinking thing" The term "thinking thing" is of course Descartes's term, but it is used here without prejudice to the theories of Descartes. The watershed which divides all philosophies of man is found right here. For either one assumes that "matter" can think, or that it cannot. The fact of thinking is indisputable, but the assumption that matter can think can only be made either by a purely verbal supposition or by ignoring the nature of thinking itself. One could never explain what thinking is to a being who did not already know in some way what thinking is, since the very fact of explanation involves a conscious cognitive re300tive being, who already knows something and moreover knows that it knows. It is easy of course to make suppositions and to suppose that thought is something other than thought: e.g that it is an electronic process in a complex machine. But all attempts at "reducing" thought to non-cognitive elements will prove unsatisfactory as long as the person who makes the supposition retains conscious aware ness, that is as long as he "knows that he knows" A little reflection will show that this line of speculation will lead to the conclusion that The point is that whatever can be experienced by mind must be a conscious phenomenon. it is therefore impossible to experience the unconscious, which must therefore remain a postulate It is postulated to explain other phenomena (conscious ones But it is always logically possible to discover other postulates which would explain the same phenomena (perhaps even better Hence the unconscious is a logical construction and might turn out to be a logical fiction (though of course this is unlikely</page><page sequence="6">19571 Russell and the Great Mystery 167 whatever the relation of psychological functions to physiological factors, they are not the same as the physiological factors. . just as there could be no immortality if there were no soul, so also there could be no immortality if the soul had not already a real existence of its own, or if it were composed of whatever matter is composed of. For the only " immortality " of matter is the tenuous possible " eternity" of its parts, and something which is dependent for its existence on a particular organization of matter or material particles cannot survive the disintegration of such organization. The fact that matter as such does not " think " but that man in fact " thinks " is the basis of the argument which establishes the required propositions about soul, viz., that it has real existence of its own and that it is not composed of matter. With regard to the possibility of survival after death, there is an interesting reflection to be made. It is very often asserted in connection with the question " can matter think " that whereas we know a great deal about what matter can do, any assertion about what it cannot do must be invalid on grounds of apriorism. The assertion that the soul cannot survive the body can be countered by the same reasoning: we know a great deal about soul and what it can do, but any assertion about what it cannot do (e.g. that it cannot survive the body must be invalid on grounds of apriorism. But those who put forward the former argument are not inclined to ac300t the latter, even though the logic of both is the same; or they are tempted to fall back on a simple agnosticism, protesting that they do not know. I am not suggesting that either argument is valid, but only that consistency demands the ac300tance or rejection of both. The latter does not establish immortality (or even the possibility of it any more than the former establishes the fact or possibility that matter can think. But it has a specious plausibility. The assertion that matter cannot think does not depend simply on what we do not know about matter, but rather on what we do know about thought The possibility of survival can be established fairly directly. If soul is what we have been contending itis, viz, something with an existence of its own and an activity of its own (thought), and is not an organization of matter, it will be seen that it could continue to exist for these three assertions add up to the notion of immaterial substance There is no way of establishing this "scientifically" (in Russell's sense of the word But it is worth recalling that the logic of the thinking involved is the same as that of the scientist who investigates matter. For he infers from the observable (e.g. the tracks on a photographic plate to the unobservable (the inner constitution of matter , Just as the philosopher infers from the observable (the; behaviour of man, including thought to the unobservable (immaterial substance</page><page sequence="7">168 Studies [SUMMER The notion of immaterial substance is foreign both to the scientific mind and the empiricist philosopher. Yet the scientific mind (as witness: Sherrington, Adrian, Hinsheiwood, Eddington, Einstein and others finds it easier to ac300t (even if for the wrong reasons than does the empiricist philosopher. Compare, for example, Hinsheiwood and Ayer. In an essay entitled " Chemistry and Modern Thought " (1953 Professor Sir Cyril Hinsheiwood, F.R.S., says : c It may reasonably be said that a purely materialist attitude (to ' the age-old problem of the relation of mind and matter' seems rather more hopeless than ever and in a larger work (195 1 he appeals to the thomistic theory of angels to illustrate a point about the internal construction of the atom. Professor Ayer on the other hand, in his The Problem oflCnowledge (1956), finds the notion of spiritual substance unintelligible. " A. view which I have not considered is that people are differentiated from one another . . by being different spiritual substances, or souls. And the reason why I have not considered it is that I do not find it intelligible." (page 209 But this statement of his is not really very good philosophizing, since "C intelligible " has a technical meaning in Ayer (it means something like " capable of withstanding the sort of test which would apply to sensory experience "-but that is my own phrase, not Professor Ayer's). And we have already stated that by definition, as it were, this sort of test could not apply. The second reason why Ayer's statement is not very good philosophizing is that to say that one does not find something to be intelligible may very well be a statement about oneself, not about that which is said to be unintelligible. The question, "does this immaterial (or' spiritual' substance actually survive the death of the body ", cannot be answered by experiment. And it can be answered in the negative either by a nego supositum argument or by a statement of impossibility..The 'nego suppositum argument would run C By asking the question, you are supposing that there is such a thing as a spiritual substance But .I deny your supposition Therefore there is no actual survival" The discussion thereupon ceases to be a discussion about immortality and reverts to one about the possibility of there being spiritual substances The second form the answer might take is this "It is impossible that anything should exist apart from matter, Therefore even if there is a spiritual component in man (but in fact, the argument would usually but not necessarily go on, there is not it could not survive the death of the body" This could very well have been the thinking of the Sadducees, or the Greeks with whom St Paul contended in the Areopagus cum audissent autem resurrectionem mortuorum, quidam quidem irridebant (Acts. 17 This argument clearly depends on the assertion that it is impossible that anything should exist apart from matter But there is no way in which this proposition could be shown to be true Either it must be</page><page sequence="8">19571 Russell and the Great Mjisterj' 169 assumed dogmatically (which is not good empiricism or else some proposition which implies it must be assumed. The usual empiricist assumption which is alleged to imply the required proposition is of the form : only what is given in sensory experience exists. This in fact is the essence of empiricism. But neither can it be shown to be true, since there is no sensory test which could possibly be appealed to in order to establish it ; and yet a sensory test is the only sort of test allowed in empiricism. Instead of asking the question in the form " does the soul survive the body " it can be asked in the form : " does the soul cease to be?" and in this form it becomes much more manageable. For if one can state the ways in which things cease to be, and then show that these do not apply to the soul, it will follow that it does not cease to be, i.e. that it is immortal. It is important to remember, however, that there is an enormous difference between a thing's ceasing to be, on the one hand, and its ceasing to be what it is, on the other. Our only experience of "ceasing to be" is in fact the experience of things ceasing to be what they are. That is to say, we experience change, transformation, resolution into parts, reduction to elements, molecules, atoms or particles. The argument that the soul does not cease to be has a deductive or a priori appearance in the form in which it is usually presented, because it is usually presented in a truncated form. In fact it is essentially an inductive piece of reasoning on the basis of experience. There is one further point: a thing can cease to be red, or blue, or hot or cold, or large or small, without ceasing either to be or to be what it is. This kind of ceasing-to-be certainly applies to the soul: it ceases to be conscious, or to be actively engaged in thinking or feeling, etc. But this is clearly not the kind of ceasing to be which is intended in the question of survival-unless one ac300ts the Humian doctrine examined in a former article: the doctrine which claims that the soul is nothing but a series of such experiences.' But this we have already, in the article referred to, found to be inadequate. On the other hand this kind of ceasing-to-be can help to clear up one difficulty. If the soul were in the same sort of category as "red ", "large" or "hot", if it were a mere quality or quantity or in general an "accident" of the body, then it would be subject to this kind of ceasing-to-be. There were in fact some nineteenth century philosophers who took this line, and described soul (or more usually "mind " as an epiphenomenon of the brain This would still be the point of view, though the terminology might be different, of those who think that electronic brains can" think" But this means in fact that there is no soul, and if there is no soul there cannot be an immortal soul Consequently, dealing with this point 'Russell and the Great Mystery.. Studies, Spring 1957 C</page><page sequence="9">170 Studies [SUMMER of view one is not really dealing with immortality, but the larger issue of materialism. There is another obvious fact about accidents : they can cease to be with the destruction of their " host ". Thus the " shape " of the statue ceases to exist with the destruction of the statue. If the soul were an accident of the body, it could cease to be in some such way as this but then it is not an accident of the body ; it is something which has existence and functions of its own. This is clearly not true of the shape of the statue : it has no existence in its own right, and there is nothing it can do of itself. One can of course deny the possibility of immaterial (or "spiritual " substance as we have seen, but the assertion: "there are no spiritual substances" is incapable of proof. And the denial itself involves the denial of immortality. Consequently, the issue once again is not really the issue of immortality, but the antecedent question of the possibility of spiritual substance. With regard to things other than accidents, the things for instance which are either red or blue or hot or cold, we have already made the assertion that such things do not cease to be in an absolute sense, but only by becoming something else, cease to be what they are. The difference is enormous. It is the difference between essence and existence, between infinite and finite causes, between reduction to parts and reduction to nothingness. With regard to anything which is composed of parts, reduction to its component parts is possible. If there are no parts, such reduction is impossible. The history of the atom illustrates the point clearly. As long as the atom was regarded as the CC ultimate" constituent of matter, it was also regarded as irreducible. This is why the "splitting of the atom" seemed to be such an exciting achievement. For the splitting of the atom meant that it was composed of parts (how ever such composition is to be understood and meant also, therefore, the abandoning of the supposition that it was an ultimate particle, with consequential recasting of our ideas about matter. The soul is not composed of parts, has no dimensions, is not quanti so that reduction to constituent parts does not arise. tative in any way, The soul has different kinds of functions and different kinds of capacity for carrying out such functions, but a capacity, (e.g. intellect is not a component part but an ability to act in a particular way. This is what is technically called the "simplicity" of the soul, a term which in English can be misleading. But simplex as opposed to complex carries no such misleading connotations. Complex means composed of parts, but simplicitas (from simplex is the quality or property of not having parts. The simplicitas of the soul follows from its not being,.composed of what ever matter is composed of nor is it a composition of matter and something else. For the former would mean that it was incapable of thought, while the latter simply, leads to an infinite regress: if there were such</page><page sequence="10">19571 Russell and the Great A'ystey 171 a composition, it is the "something else ", not the matter in the composition, which would be the soul; and if this something else is so composed, then again the soul will be the non-material constituent, and so on. The conclusion must be that the soul does not cease to be by reduction to parts. And the only alternative remaining for consideration is the possibility of ceasing to be outright; this means annihilation, and the term is used here literally. Does the soul cease to be by its being reduced to nothingness, to non-existence, by an exercise of omnipotent power For there is no other way in which annihilation can be achieved. Annihilation is the correlative of creation. The latter means causing something to be where there was nothing; the former is the reverse process; and neither is within the compass of finite beings. If God does not annihilate the soul, then it does not cease to be. Does he do so There is no doubt that God could, in his omnipotent power, annihilate the soul, and one might as well face the fact. But that he does not do so and will not do so, follows from our knowledge of God, even such knowledge as can be achieved by natural reason without recourse to revelation. For (bearing in mind the difference between finite and infinite, and therefore that our terms are to some extent anthropomorphic, or more accurately are used "analogically " it can be shown that God is intellect. He does not therefore act without a purpose. He therefore had a purpose in making the soul the kind of thing it is: a spiritual substance, not composed of parts, and therefore not subject to the kind of ceasing-to-be to which other creatures are subject. In other words, he made the soul immortal, and he had a purpose in so doing. If now he annihilates the soul, we are faced with a dilemma: either God had no purpose in creating the soul immortal, or he now defeats his own purpose. And both consequents are absurd in regard to God. Therefore the soul is not annihilated. Therefore it is immortal. One must bear in mind the difference between proving a conclusion and winning assent to it. This was Newman's problem in his Grammar of Assent. It is quite clear that people assent to the im mortality of the soul for reasons other than those of the above line of argument, and others reject it for reasons other than philosophical ones. But when it is contended that reason cannot establish a proposition or, as with Russell, that it establishes its contradictory, it becomes imperative to try once again to vindicate reason. The problem of immortality is the pivot of metaphysic (Marcel's words in the sense that one's stand on this problem determines one's stand on all problems C2</page><page sequence="11">172 Studies of life. Russell in one of his rare emotional passages' falls back on a romantic but perhaps unconvincing Stoicism when he contemplates death: One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection Let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with ourselves . The notion that life is a tragedy is echoed in existentialist writings: life is absurd, and angoisse is the key to it. It does not matter what you do, since there are no values, no standards, no criteria, by which to judge the value of life or action. You create your own values, in your very strivings for purposes, and whatever purpose yeu choose gives value to your endeavours to attain it. In the long run, however, you are deceived. The malignant de600 of death catches up with you, and destroys both your ends and the means you have taken to achieve them. What matters is neither the ends nor the means you have adopted: they are in themselves valueless anyway. What matters is that you should commit yourself wholeheartedly to your ends and means: engagement totale is the clue. If you are going to be a murderer, be a clever one ; a swindler, be a successful one ; a traitor, live for treason. The strength of the existentialist movement in philosophy lies in its consistent logic: in its not flinching from drawing the conclusions to which its premisses point. Sartre himself described it as an attempt to draw all the conclusions of consistent atheism. But many, like Russell, try to have it both ways: to retain atheism and materialism, and at the same time to defend traditional values, even ethical ones. It has often been pointed out that on the materialist hypothesis there can be no values, and Kant even went as far as trying to prove the immortality of ijie soul by a transcendental deduction from the existence of ethical values. At least this much is true: ethical values would be in the long run meaningless without the con300t of immortality. 1" A Free Man's Worship" in Mysticism and Logic.</page></plain_text>
