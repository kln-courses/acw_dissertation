<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ISRAELITE SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX BY DANIEL LYS Montpellier Some years ago I began my investigations of biblical anthropology with a monograph on nephesh. This monograph 1) dealt basically with two problems: the idea of the soul held by the forerunners and con- temporaries of Israel, and the chronological study of the use of nephesh in the Old Testament. At that time I proposed that the next two steps should be: 1) a study of the translation of this Hebrew word in the ancient versions of the Old Testament, above all the Septuagint and the Vulgate; and 2) an examination of what I called the 'affinities' of nephesh, i.e., the other Hebrew words used in a more or less parallel way in order to express the anthropological reality. Recently I brought out a monograph on one of these words 2), and in the present study I intend to take up the problem of the understanding of the Israelite soul in the LXX. The benefit of such a study may be twofold. First, whereas the Hebrew literature is scattered all along ten centuries, with many modi- fications, alterations, and additions, in a process of constant actualiza- tion, redaction and edition, a translation may be visualized as (rough- ly!) a comparatively "simultaneous" unity. Though it was not the work of one day, the LXX has an inclusive understanding, instead of the many variations throughout the centuries of composition and edition of the Hebrew text. It is always interesting to know how a translation has understood and reproduced such an ambiguous idea. Moreover, in the present case we deal with the Hellenistic world, where the word psyche had also a long history and a rich meaning. Consequently such a study can help us to see how the Old Testament idea was understood and can confirm or invalidate my own inter- pretation of nephesh, thanks to the various nuances of this rendering 1) Nephesh.

Of course, if this rendering is in the Hellenistic line of thought, the result will not be very clear; it will be possible to conclude either that this was the meaning of the Hebrew word, or that the translation reflects only the Hellenistic culture of the Jewry of the Diaspora. But if the rendering is different from the Hellenistic understanding of the soul, this may be a clue for the way in which the Hellenistic Jews continued to understand nephesh in a Jewish sense in spite of the cultural environment. The next step would be to compare this understanding with the author's interpretation of nephesh. The second benefit of such a study concerns the New Testament. For an exhaustive inquiry about psyche in the New Testament similar to my monograph about nephesh, it would be helpful to know how psyche was used or not used in the rendering of the Hebrew word, just on the threshold of the New Testament period. This will lead the exegete to a provisional, basic understanding of psyche either in terms of the Jewish or the Hellenistic background. There has been remarkable ambiguity concerning the idea of the soul, especially since Plato developed Orphic dualism. I do not need to describe this well known fact. But I should merely like here to sum up the conclusions of my own study of nephesh. Even in the earliest Old Testament texts this word has several meanings: life; what lives and dies; the affections, i.e., need and appetite, desire and pleasure, the feelings; several localizations ("interior", liver, blood, breath"); the animate, living being (cf. even the animal), and then the Self, I. The basis is the primitive idea of "potentiality" manifested in the various aspects of vitality, as expressing the totality of life, the starting point being the act of breathing and its localization in the throat. But if nephesh can indicate the living being and be rendered by the personal pronoun, it has no personal quality; it is the animation of a personal being, but not what gives this being his personal identity; in other words, nephesh is not an ontological substance. Man is nephesh as far as he is alive. Later the idea of the individual is empha- sized, and nephesh indicates the living being who may be numbered (either man or animal): a responsible individual. At this same time, because of cultic concern, the potentiality in the being become more important than the potentiality of the being. Nephesh had come to designate the corpse, which is not merely an individual (dead) being, but something whose potentiality is dangerous. The identification of nephesh with the blood is emphasized. It is what, in the being, can 182</page><page sequence="3">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX defile or be defiled. This reached its apex in the priestly texts concerned with the distinction between sacred and profane. But nephesh was never considered as a divine element, thanks to which the being would be personal. This variety of meanings shows the origins of the idea in primitive potentiality. And when Israel encountered Hellenistic culture, it continued to consider the soul as it had pre- viously. Israel never tried to sweep away the ancient meanings in order to offerthe "revelation" of a substance-soul. On the contrary nephesh is in a certain way the equivalent of bsidr. The fate of the soul is more or less similar to the fate of the body, since the soul is nothing but the animation of the body. But although using the primitive, Semitic idea, Israel gave it new implications because of its theology. The potentiality which is the basis of nephesh never led Israel to wor- ship the souls, and what we find in the Old Testament about a cult of the dead is just residual and rejected! Even in the Priestly School which dangerously distinguished between sacred and profane, this potentiality developed in the vitality of the creature before God rather than in the numinousness of a dualistic conception. The idea of a double or of an exterior soul is very rare. What is amazing is not the fact that we meet such occurrences, but that they are so few! There is no speculation about the destiny of the soul in she'ol. (Of course, it would be a false question as to whether the 'animation' of a body is mortal or immortal.) Nephesh does not provide any possibility for the continuity of individual existence beyond the absolute discontinuity of death. If this continuity can occur (later!), it will be the free and new work of the Creator and not a human quality. Then we meet this paradox: in order to speak of man as a mere creature Israel used the very word which previously could indicate the numinous, the sacred, perhaps the divine, but Israel purified this idea from any implication which might abolish the limits between God and man. On the contrary, Israel meant by this word the reality of the creature distinguished from the creator. Nephesh means basically the life-not the divine potentiality in the being, but the animate creature, responsible before his God, and alive only as far as his God helps, forgives, and strengthens him. This anthropology is derived from Old Testament theology, whose monotheism cannot accept any divine essence in the creature, but considers the creature as the vis-a-vis chosen by God (and emphasizes the value of matter and the reality of death). I must add that my subsequent study of ruah has confirmed this interpretation of nephesh. 183</page><page sequence="4">D. LYS The present inquiry as to how the Greek translators understood this idea will be divided into two parts: 1) how the word nephesh was translated in Greek; 2) what Hebrew words were translated by psyche and its derivatives. Curiously but obviously, nothing can be drawn from the texts where nephesh is translated by psyche, since the interpretation of psychg must not be prejudiced. What is interesting is: 1) what other Greek words are used to render the Hebrew word and do they confirm or invalidate the above interpretation of nephesh (a. in each passage; b. in the whole of the Old Testament); and 2) how are psyche and its derivatives used for rendering other Hebrew words. This may show what content the LXX gave to psyche as a translation also for nephesh. For the abbreviations of the names of Codices and recensions I use the signs and symbols employed by the following books, the basic tools for this study: RUDOLF KITTEL: Biblia Hebraica (P. KAHLE, A. ALT, O. EISSFELDT, 3rd edition) = BH; ALFRED RAHLFS: Septuaginta (6th ed.) = AR; EDWIN HATCH and HENRY A. REDPATH: A Concordance to the Sep- tuagint and the other Greek versions of the Old Testament (including the Apocryphal Books)= HR. It goes without saying that in spite of the most careful use mistakes can easily occur in the handling of tools such as concordances; conse- quently, once for all at the beginning of this study, it must be under- stood that any listing must be taken with the conventional caution "errors and omissions excepted." Furthermore, it is not my purpose to engage in textual criticism and establish the "true reading." I do not want to go beyond quoting Rahlfs' text and the important variants 1). Lastly, the chapters and verses, except when specified 1) I do not deny the possibility that an authentic Hebrew tradition other than the MT could account for many of the different readings of the LXX. Even so, I would emphasize the fact that such a diversion was possible because of the flexibility of nephesh within the Hebrew tradition. Moreover, my inquiry will perhaps show that in the most interesting cases of diversion it is not necessary to suppose a different Hebrew text, since, as I argue, the different terms used in the LXX to translate nephesh represent a legitimate understanding of nephesh. In other words, the differences can legitimately derive from the MT by direct interpretation or from a Hebrew Vorlage which represents the flexibility of nephesh within the Hebrew tradition. Then the differences would mean neither that the Hebrew behind the LXX is essentially different from the MT, nor that the LXX has translated such passages with a prejudice of its own, but that the LXX indicates an understanding of the MT (directly or through the Hebrew Vorlage) better than that of most heirs of Plato. 184</page><page sequence="5">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX differently, are quoted according to the numbering of the MT in BH for the purpose of easier comparison with my study of nephesh. The order of the quoted texts generally follows the chronology of the Hebrew original. I. THE GREEK TRANSLATIONS OF NEPHESH 1. The verb ndphash: A special section must be devoted to the verb ndphash. This verb is found in the niphal in 2 Sam. xvi 14 (J); Ex. xxiii 12 (E); and Ex. xxxi 17 (P). The meaning is "to breathe," "to take breath," "to refresh oneself" after an important effort producing fatigue. The first text deals with the flight of David; the other two concern the rest on the seventh day and have ndphash in parallelism with shdbhath for man and for God respectively. In 2 Sam. xvi 14, the Greek verb is anapsychein, in which psyche is parallel to nphsh, plus the renewal expressed by ana. The meaning of the "renewal of the soul" is "to restore (by fresh air)," "to refresh," "to relieve," then "to take breath," "to breathe," "to rest after tiredness," "to recover." It is clear that the basic meaning is the movement of air in breathing, since the derivative meanings of psychein are "to make cool" and "to dry" 1). Ex. xxiii 12 uses the same Greek verb, whereas anapauein (twice) translates both shabhath and noah, indicating a stop and then a rest. The same idea of refreshing and recovering is expressed here. We may note that the original hand of Codex Vaticanus (B) has a third anapauein (instead of anapsychein) emphasizing the fact that the "renewal of the soul" is precisely the fact of recovering strength when one is out of breath. Ex. xxxi 17 avoids anapsychein, perhaps in order not to apply too coarse an anthropomorphism to God. Here the Hebrew verb is translated either by pauein or by katapauein, according to the alternate order in which these verbs are used for shabhath and naphash. Once more it is the idea of stop, and then rest. Note also that Aquila uses anapsychein in this verse. I would conclude that these translations confirm the etymological connection of nphsh with Akkadian napdshu, "to breathe" (with 1) Cf. A.

We are faced with vegetative life, always threatened, always to be renewed, and not with a spiritual entity. (The uses of anapsychein and its derivatives for the translation of Hebrew words other than nphsh will be dealt with in Part II.) 2. Pgche 1): The noun nephesh is used 754 times in the Old Testament (never in the Aramaic portions). Of these 754 occurrences, about 680 are translated by psyche. I say "about," because such a reckoning depends upon the variants chosen (done here after Rahlfs' text) 2). Of course, the comparison of these variants may be very significant for the understanding of the use of psyche and other words as the translation 1) It is impossible to draw anything from the proper name Naphish, reproduced only in transcriptions of various sorts, in spite of the translation offered by L. KOEHLER, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros: "big wealth" (Gen. xxv 15, 1 Chron. i 31, v 19). 2) L. KOEHLER, Lexicon, s.v. Nephesh, indicates in the statistics 755 uses of nephesh in the Old Testament (which is the right figure if both the ketib and the qere of Jer. ii 24 are counted as in S. MANDELKERN, Veteris Testamenti Concordan- tiae, editio minor: cf. my Nephesh, p. 116); but he indicates only 600 uses of psyche in LXX! The number is of course too low, even if the variants without psych were accepted. (But in his O.T. Theology (1935; Engl. transl. by A. S. TODD, the Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1957, p. 142) he indicates 756 uses in MT out of which "more than 650" are translated by psyche.) Those variants are about seven- teen: 1 Kings ii 23 A (cf. HR and A. E. BROOKE, N. MCLEAN and H. St. JOHN THACKERAY, The Old Testament in Greek, Cambridge University Press, Vol. II, Part II, 1930, but not indicated by AR); Jer. iv 19 S*+ (but only for an extra use of psyche for the MT's lebh); Deut. xii 20 (2nd occurrence) A+; xiii 7 R (cf. HR); xiv 26 B (homoioteleuton); Jon. i 14 S*+ (homoioteleuton); Zech. xi 8 (2nd) S*+; Jer. xvii 21 A; Num. xxx 14 A+; Ps. lxxxviii 15 B; xciv 19 S+; cvii 9 (1st) R (according to HR); cxxi 2 (lst) A; cxliii 3 B+; Job iii: 20 BS (HR); vi 7 BS*; vii 15 A+ (but also an extra psyche in this verse in the same MS). Below we shall try to see what these variants mean. But one must be aware of the fact that the same codices or MSS also offer additions for the alternate use of psyche: 2 Sam. xix 6 (1st) most Minuscules and (4th) A+0247 L+; Num. xxiii 10 LXX; Ju. x 16 B (but A reads oligopsychein); Isa. xxxii 6 LXX; Jer. iv 19 LXX except S; Ez. xxvii 31 AB+; xxxiii 5 A; Gen. xvi 27 (3rd) R; Hag. ii 13 AQW*; Ps. lvii 7 S; lxxiv 19 LXX; Lam. iii 24 R; Job iii 20 A; vii 15 A (but cf. above); xvi 4 (2nd) A+; xxxiii 28 S (but the text itself is restored by Origen); xxxv 30 ASCV+; Pry. xiii 25 LXX; xv 32 LXX; xxii 23 S*+; xxviii 17a LXX (absent from the MT, borrowed from xxix 17): say 22; this also will be significant below. Of course, it is also possible to subtract the passages restored by Origen, viz., 1 Kings xvii 22, 2 Kings xii 5 (0+ according to AR, A according to HR); Est. vii 7 (0+, not reckoned by me); ix 16 (idem); Job xxx 16; xxxiii 20; xxxiii 28, or by Origen and Lucian, viz., 1 Sam. xvii 55; xviii 1 ter and 3; thus 12 quotations less with respect to my figure of 680 (I accepted in my figure the passages restoring the text, but not those which added something to the MT). 186</page><page sequence="7">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX of nephesh. (This would be a first step toward the next section, which deals with how nephesh is translated in the other 74 passages.) Though the translation of nephesh merely by psyche does not give a clue for the understanding of the idea of the soul, I should like to make a few remarks. A) The first thing to be noted is the variation in number (singular or plural) between the MT and the LXX. Of course, in most cases the number is the same in both the Hebrew and the Greek. But in several texts there is a difference. Since it is known that the use of the plural of nephesh is rather rare, only 51 occurrences 1), we may guess that the variation will be between a Hebrew singular and a Greek plural. This variation can have several aspects: a) Nephesh in the singular plus a possessive word or suffix in the plural is represented by psyche in the plural plus a possessive plural. For example, the Hebrew word in the meaning 1) "life": "the soul (life) of thine enemies" becomes in the LXX "the souls (lives) of thine enemies," 1 Kings iii 11; "to seek their life" becomes "to seek their lives," Jer. xix 7; xxi 7; "in (= at the risk of) our life" becomes "in our lives," Lam. v 9; "to spare or deliver or redeem their life from death" becomes ". . . their lives from death", Ps. xxxiii 19; xxxiv 23; lxxii 14; lxxviii 50 (this meaning is not far from 7 below, "self"). Ps. lxxiv 19 b must be added, where an extra psyche occurs instead of the Hebrew word for "life", hayydh (cf. Part II of the present study): "the life of thy poor ones" becomes "the psychai of thy poor ones." The same holds true concerning: 2) their "appetite," "need," even "stomach": Hosea ix 4; Ez. vii 19. Prov. xiii 25 b must be added, where an extra pyche occurs instead of the Hebrew word for "belly" (cf. Part II): "the belly of the wicked ones" becomes "the psychai of the wicked ones." 3) "Desire," "longing": Jer. xxii 27; xliv 14; Ps. lxxviii 18, where the change to a plural takes place also for the parallel, "heart": "they tempted God in their heart/hearts, in asking meat according to their soul/souls"; Prov. xiii 2; probably Ez. 1) 44, according to KOEHLER, Lexicon, s.v., who probably does not take account of the 2 or 3 uses in the same verse. Cf. my Nephbsh, p. 136, about the expression "all nephesh," based on the primitive idea of the soul of the group, but indicating the existence of individuals seen not in the personal originality of each of them, but in their social juxtaposition and totalization. Because this totalization was still undetermined, nephesh was in the singular. But, as I noted there, the next step would be a totalization of census, as in the expression "a town of 3,000 souls," in the plural. Cf. below point c. 187</page><page sequence="8">D. LYS xxiv 21. Hosea iv 8 must be added, where the MT reads "her (my people's) soul," but about 20 MSS have the plural possessive "their (the priests') soul," and the LXX reads "their souls." 4) "Fancy," "convenience," "pleasure," when somebody is delivered to the soul/ souls of his enemies: Ez. xvi 27; Ps. xxvii 12. 5) Feelings: their soul/ souls abhorred Yahweh: Zech. xi 8 (second occurrence). In Is. xix 10, "the grieved ones of soul" becomes "they will be pained in souls," without any explicit possessive adjective. In Job iii 20, "the bittered ones of soul" becomes "the souls in griefs" (note that in both latter texts the meaning is near 6). 6) Vitality, potentiality of the whole being, which is the basis and the thinge of all meanings: "to find rest (or purification) for their soul/souls," Jer. vi 16; "we mortified our soul/souls," Is. lviii 3 (not far from 7, "self"); "in their soul/souls, God sent emaciation" (but the LXX reads "fullness"; cf. 2 above), Ps. cvi 15; "give your heart/hearts and your soul/souls to seek the Lord," 1 Chr. xxii 19; "by meat men restore their soul/souls," Lam. i 19, "poured in suffering," Lam. ii 12. Here Prov. xxv 13 must be added, where the MT reads: "he restores the soul of 'adhonayw; this form may be taken as a singular (plural of intensity; cf. e.g. Gen. xxiv 9; Ex. xxi 4, etc.; the suffix with 'ddhon is always added to the plural form, except the first person singular and once the first person plural), but is a plural from the parallelism; nevertheless the whole is read as a singular by the Vg (and French translations), but as a plural by the LXX (and KJV and RSV), and then psyche is accordingly in the plural. 7) Nephesh is the being, the self, the person who lives and dies, and is also used as a reflexive pronoun: they save or deliver their soul/souls, that is to say (cf. 1 above) their life/lives, themselves: Jer. xlviii 6; Ez. xiv 20 1). It is clear from this that the LXX has a tendency to consider the "soul" in a more individualistic way than does the Hebrew text; the latter was still under the influence of the collective soul; the LXX is more respectful of the reality of each being as an individual person to be distinguished from another. But this does not mean that the LXX grants everyone a personal soul in the Platonic meaning of this word, viz., a soul giving each being its individuality. This is proved first by the fact that "soul" means the several realities we have just seen (including "belly"). Second, the same construction and alteration 1) Cf. below I/3/A/c, nephesh (singular) and suff. plural translated merely by the personal pronoun plural. 188</page><page sequence="9">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX occur also for "heart" (as I have noted at Ps. lxxviii 18; 1 Chr. xxii 19). Third, as I must now show, this alteration is not systematic at all, and the LXX is able to keep the singular plus possessive plural, just as in the MT, and sometimes in the same text where an alteration also occurs. For meaning No. 1 note 2 Sam. xix 6, second and third occurrences (and the fourth in A+ 0247 L+); Josh. ii: 14; Jer. xlix 37; 2 Kings i 13 (second) and 14; 2 Chr. i 11; Lam. ii 19. There are also some texts where the meaning may be related to No. 6, viz., 1 Sam. xxv 29 (third); Ez. xxxiii 6; or to No. 7, viz., 2 Kings vii 7; Is. iii 9; liii 10; Esther ix 16 in 0+. For meaning No. 2 see Jer. xxxi 12 (but S+ reads singular possessive) and 14; Ps. cvii 5; plus Num. xi 6, which may also belong to No. 6. For meaning No. 3 see Jer. xxxiv 16 and Is. lxvi 3 (but also cf. No. 7); Ez. xxiv 25 (but also cf. No. 4 for which there is no other example). For meaning No. 5, see 2 Kings ix 15 and Gen. xxiii 8 (but cf. No. 7); Ps. xxxiii 20 (idem); plus 2 Sam. xvii 8, where in the MT the phrase "the bittered ones of soul" is followed by the separate personal pronoun in the plural and not by the suffix, but the LXX has the plural genitive auton, reshaping the common Hebrew construction (note that in Is. lvi 11 the "insatiable ones of soul" is kept in the same form by the LXX, contrary to Is. xix 10 in the former paragraph). For meaning No. 6 (cf. already above) see Job xxiv 12; Ps. cvi 15 in BS (the other MSS read plural, as quoted in the previous paragraph); and the typical Deuteronomic expression (to be related also to No. 7) in Joshua xxii 5; xxiii 14; 1 Kings ii 4; viii 48; Deut. xiii 4; 2 Chr. vi 38 1). For meaning No. 7 (cf. above) see Is. xlvii 14; Job xvi 4, xxxvi 14. Thus it is clear that the LXX is able to follow exactly the Hebrew construction. Furthermore, both con- structions of pyche-the singular or the plural with a plural possessive word or suffix-can occur in the same text, instead of repeating the Hebrew singular plus plural possessive: cf. Ez. xxiv 21 and 25 (same meaning, but different constructions in the two Greek texts); Ps. xxxiii 19 and 20 (but different meanings); Lam. ii 12 and 19 (not so different). I have already indicated that Ps. cvi 15 is read differently according to the various MSS. Let me add that 2 Chr. i 11 (where the LXX keeps the singular plus plural possessive) is just a kind of repetition of 1 Kings iii 11 (where the LXX translates by a plural plus plural possessive). 1) Note that in 2 Chr. xv 12, the LXX suppresses the Hebrew plural suffix, but it does the same in 2 Chr. xxxiv 31 for the singular suffix, in the same expression. 189</page><page sequence="10">Note that Jer. xiii 17 in the MT reads singular plus possessive singular 1st person, but the LXX has possessive plural 2nd person (but psyche in the singular); in 2 Kings i 14, the LXX reads not "my life" (except B Sy+ which follow the MT) but "the life of thy ser- vants" (singular plus possessive plural). The TXX is able to use this Hebrew collective form even when the LXX introduces the plural. Furthermore, Is liii 10, which differs somewhat from the Hebrew text, uses in Greek, on its own initiative, the typical MT form, viz., singular plus possessive plural. And in Ez. xlvii 9 and Gen. i 21, kol-nephesh (ha)hayydh is translated pasa psyche (ton) ZoMn-singular plus possessive plural-while in Job xii 10, nephesh kol-.hay becomes psyche panton ton Zonton. It is thus clear that the LXX is not afraid of the Hebrew construction of singular plus plural possessive, and does not at times reject the MT because of a different ontological doctrine. b) Nephesh in the singular plus possessive singular becomes psychg in the plural plus possessive plural. I have already noted two texts which offer a transition between a) and b): cf. above Hos. iv 8 and Prov. xxv 13. In 1 Kings xx 31, instead of "thy life" the LXX reads "your lives"; in Is. xxxii 6: "the soul of the hungry one" becomes "the hungry souls" (plus an extra use in the same construction by parallelism: cf. below II/1/A/a); Ez. xxvii 13: "soul of man"/"souls of men," concerning the trade of slaves (same phrase in the reckonings of Num. xxxi 35 (1st), 40 (1st), 46; 1 Chr. v 21; cf. below, point c); Prov. viii 36: "against his own soul"/"their own souls"; xii 10: "he knows the soul of his cattle"/"the souls .. ." (perhaps because "cattle" is plural in the LXX while singular in MT). To this may be related what will be seen below in point c about the expression "all soul(s)." Here the LXX reads merely a plural whereas the MT has a singular, and the LXX puts the whole expression in the plural. Perhaps if the MT had had a plural, it would be as usual nephesh in the singular plus possessive plural. But the MT knows also the form plural plus possessive plural: cf. 2 Sam. xxiii 17; Joshua ii 13; ix 24; xxiii 11; Jer. ii 34; xxvi 19; xxxvii 9; xlii 20; xliv 7; Deut. iv 15; Lev. xi 43, 44; xvii 11 (2nd); xx 25; Gen. ix 5 (1st); Ex. xvi 16; Num. xxxi 50; 1 Chr. xi 19 (lst and 2nd); Jer. xvii 21; Ex. xxx 15, 16; Lev. xvi 29, 31; xxiii 27, 32; Num. xvii 3; xxix 7; Ps. lxxii 13; xcvii 10; Prov. i 18; and cf. Ez. xiii 18 (3rd). Consequently this change to the plural does not give a specific indication. We can merely see the tendency of the I.XX to choose the plural for emphasis upon the reality of man as a 190 D. LYS</page><page sequence="11">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX unity in an enumeration or an addition, instead of the global reality of the group. But this same tendency already existed in the Hebrew; even Ps. lxxii 13 uses nephesh in the plural plus a possessive plural, while Ps. lxxii 14 uses nephesh in the singular with a plural suffix as we have seen above in point a (both are in the plural in the LXX) 1). A series of somewhat different cases deals with the texts in which, without any indication of a possessor, the MT singular corresponds to a plural in the LXX; note Ez. xxii 25: "leaders in Jerusalem devour soul"/"souls"; xxxvi 5: "despising the soul"/"the souls"; Prov. vi 26: "to hunt the soul"/"souls" (and the reading of the LXX adds as a determinative "man," plural, whereas the singular concerned "wo- man" in the MT: cf. atnah); Lev. xxi 1: "defile oneself for a corpse"/ "defile themselves for corpses"; xix 8; "this individual will be cut off from his people"/"these individuals .. ." 2); Gen. xlvi 18, 27 (1st); Num. xxxi 40 (2nd); Deut. x 22, "in reckoning so many (figure) soul"/ "souls" (cf. below point c with "all"); Gen. i 20: "a swarm of soul of life"/"reptiles of living souls" (but i 21 translates "every soul of the creeping life" by "all souls of living reptiles," and i 24, with the same phrase as i 20, translates by a singular). The emphasis of the plurals is on the reality of the individual even when considered in a group or in general, as is well illustrated by the last text of this series, Ps. xix 8, where in the Greek the law of Yahweh converts (or restores) the souls, not merely the soul in general as in the MT, but the soul of everybody who studies and practices it3). On the other hand it must be noticed that in Lam. iii 25, though the LXX reads the first 1) All 51 texts in the plural in the MT are also in the plural in the LXX, except Jos. ii 13; Lv. xxi 11; Lv. xxvii 2; Prov. xiv 25, where there is a singular; Gen. xxxvi 6; Num. xxxi 50; Prov. i 18 (?), where there is another word in the plural in Greek; and 2 Kings xii 5; Josh. xxiii 11; Ez. xxii 27; Pry. i 18 (?), where there is an omission. Later we shall see more about those alterations. Let us note here a text such as Lv. xviii 29, where "souls will be cut" is a continuation in the plural of the singular "everyone who makes" in the beginning of the verse. 2) Let us note that: 1. We deal here with a nuance of meaning not already met in this article: "soul" means the animated being, the animal, the living being which can be reckoned as a unity in an enumeration. This will be the meaning in the next paragraphs, and we shall see how the LXX emphasizes the individual charac- ter. 2. The transposition of the last expression is exceptional; normally this expression is kept in the singular by the LXX, e.g., Gen. xvii 14; Ex. xxxi 14; Lv. vii 25; Num. xix 20, etc. And cf. above, note 1, about Lv. xviii 29. 3) We shall see below, in I/3/A/c, that Gen. xiv 21 transforms the singular of the MT into the plural andras (but Gen. xxxvi 6 reads the plural in bothl). And in Jos. x 28-xi 11 the LXX translation is empneon, except A which reads the plural in x 37 (lst). 191</page><page sequence="12">D. LYS part of the verse in the plural with the qere, it has the second part (with "soul") in the singular. c) The next group in which the plural replaces the singular deals with the expression "every soul," "all the soul." First, this becomes merely "the souls," the plural giving the translation of "all," once more giving up the primitive formulation based on the collective potentiality for the benefit of an emphasis on the multiplicity of individuals who constitute the group; note 1 Sam. xxii 22; Jer. xliii 6 1); cf. above, point b, Ez. xxvii 13, etc. On the other hand, "every/all (the) soul" becomes "all (pl.) (the) souls" in the reckonings of Gen. xlvi 15 (with "sons and daughters" now in apposition), 22, 25, 26 (1st, 2nd), 27 (2nd); Ex. i 5 (1st); Num. xxxi 35 (2nd) (except A which keeps the singular). But it must be noted that the LXX is also able to retain the construction with the singular as in the MT; note Gen. ii 19 (with "all" placed before as in the MT, and therefore neuter); Ez. xlvii 9 and Gen. i 21: "every/all soul of (the) life" becomes "every/all soul of the living ones" (with an indication of the plurality in another way!). Note also Lev. xvii 12, 15; xxiii 29, 30 (1st); Ex. xii 16; Lev. vii 27 (1st); xi 46 (2nd) (both have "every/all (the) soul"); Gen. ix 10, 12, 15, 16; Lev. xi 10 ("every living soul"; note that Lev. xi 46, first occurrence, loses "living" in the LXX); Num. xix 11 ("every/all soul of man") (and Num. xxxi 35, second occurrence, in A as noted above) 2). The last remark to be made here is about the addition of "all" in the LXX in order to specify the plurality of "soul," which is kept nevertheless in the singular; note Gen. xii 5: "the soul"/"every soul" (which they had gotten in Haran); Num. vi 6: "he shall not come nigh to (any) soul of dead"/"finished soul" = corpse 3). The conclusion to be drawn from such an analysis is that the LXX emphasizes more clearly the justaposition and enumeration of the indi- viduals; in other words a group is described as a plurality. But this 1) But in Jer. xliii 6, A adds pasas. 2) Note that the Hebrew kol is translated differently whether it means "every" (LXX pas) or "complete" (LXX Colos, in the Deuteronomic expression: Josh. xxii 5; 1 Kings ii 4; viii 48; Dt. xiii 4). In the latter cases we do not deal with an enumeration as in the former. This is why I kept the former in group a, and we can note that the LXX always keeps the singular for this use. An exception is Jer. xxxii 41, where the MT reads the Deuteronomic expression, while the LXX suppresses the possessive pronoun as if something had to be planted in every heart and in every soul (but A adds the possessive after "heart"). 3) Cf. below, I/3/A/c, where in Pry. xiii 4 (1st), the LXX says "every lazy one" instead of "soul of lazy one." 192</page><page sequence="13">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX does not mean that the LXX wants to speak of individual souls (in the Platonic sense), since in other cases it keeps the Hebrew collec- tive rendering. In the MT it is precisely when nephesh means beings to be enumerated that it is used as a singular (according to the normal pattern of the syntax of the numerals); e.g., "soul thirty." The LXX draws the consequences, yet without falling in a dualistic interpreta- tion 1). Moreover, let us remember that the LXX offers the several various meanings in agreement with the MT. B) Some brief remarks must be made about a few texts in which, in some of the constructions indicated above, the MT plural becomes a singular in the LXX. Note Josh. ii 13: "you will deliver our souls/ my soul, from death" (this, of course, is just a different text); Lev. xxi 11: "he shall not go in to any souls of dead"/"any finished soul" (the same phrase as in Num. 6: 6 above) 2); Lev. xxvii 2 speaks of "thy valuation of the souls" (MT), which is better rendered by the LXX as "the valuation of his soul," applying to this specific case the general rule about the vows concerning the persons (and their replacement by money: 2 Kings xii 16). Prov. xiv 25 uses "soul" absolutely: "a faithful witness delivers the souls/soul (from evil)." In Ps. xlix 9, "the redemption of their soul (= being)" becomes in the LXX "the redemption of his soul"; this is consistent with the tendency of the LXX toward agreement of the noun with the posses- sive pronoun, as we have seen above, but here this agreement is ac- tualized by reducing the pronoun to the singular. Here may be noted what was seen at the end of point A/b about Lam. iii 25 keeping the singular for "soul" in spite of reading the plural at the beginning of the verse. Four other texts can be indicated in this section on typical uses 1) Cf. above, p. 187, note 1. 2) Cf. my Nephesh. p. 164, about this Hebrew plural with meth as noun. This is not exactly the soul(s) of a dead, but the souls characterized by death; i.e., in the singular, a dead nephesh-nephesh meaning the being who was previously living-, a dead being. There is the same paradox in speaking of a dead nephesh (since nephesh is realted to life) as in speaking of a dead being (since a being has and is a positive reality). These expressions use the noun in a retrospective sense, by relation to what this was before death. This the LXX has well understood. Of course, in the MT there was also the background of the primitive potentiality. Note that the texts using nephesh (singular) absolutely as "corpse" are translated with psyche, both in the singular (Lv. xix 28; Num. v 2; etc.) and in the plural (Lv. xxi 1 above, 1/2/A/b). Elsewhere the MT and the LXX use, for this meaning, the expression "a soul of man (who is dead)"; cf. Num. xix 11, 13 (lst), and Num. ix 10, where "corpse" (MT) becomes "corpse of man" (LXX), on this pattern but not merely with the bare word. 193</page><page sequence="14">D. LYS in the singular. In these texts the singular is found both in the MT and the LXX; but the wording in the verse is slightly changed. In 1 Sam. xx 4, "what thy soul says" becomes "what thy soul desires," which makes more sense and expresses the true meaning behind any "uttered" desire. In 1 Sam. xxiii 23: 20, the "desire of the soul" becomes in the LXX simply "the soul," showing that this word is taken here also, as in the MT, in the meaning classified above in A/a under number 3. On the contrary, Is. lviii 10 (lst), which reads "if thou offer to the hungry thy soul," is interpreted as "the bread from thy soul." If the MT is not to be corrected, the LXX means not "generously, with a good heart," but "the bread which was necessary for satisfying thine own appetite and thine own life." Let us add that Ps. xi 5 reads, in the MT, "his (Yahweh's) soul hates him that loves violence," but in the LXX, "he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul." The meaning here (avoiding anthropomorphism) goes from feelings to potentiality, life and self. Curiously enough, these texts dealt with the affective life. The small alterations confirm -roughly-my interpretation of nephesh in my monograph. And this is a transition toward section 1/3 concerning how nephesh was trans- lated otherwise than by psyche. 3. Translations of "Nephesh" other than by "Psyche" 1). A This is the most important part of the study, since in some texts nephesh is not simply translated by psyche, which in itself cannot give any clue except, as seen above, by a change in number, but is, as it were, interpreted by being rendered by another word. I have already 1) Let us recall that some use of nephesh are lacking in the LXX. These can be classified under three heads: 1) Plain omissions, e.g., Josh. x 32 (fragment of verse passed over); x 37 (2nd) (omission by parallelism-anyway 37 (lst) uses empneon; cf. I/3); xxiii 11 (understood: "take good heed (to yourselves) to love the Lord"); Jer. xxxiv 20, 21 (fragments passed over because of parallelism); xxxviii 16 (2nd) (fragments passed over); xix 9 (idem, parallelism); Deut. xxi 14 (useless for the meaning; the complete phrase occurs at Jer. xxxiv 16 in both the MT and the LXX; at Deut. xxi 14, each text chose only one of the two words. The MT has "according to their soul," i.e., "at their own disposal," the LXX, "free"); Jer. xlvi 26 (verse passed over); li 45 (four and one half verses passed over); Ez. xxii 27 (passed over as parallel to and consequence of "shedding blood"); Lv. xvii 14 (2nd) (this word passed over as redundant); xxiv 18 (lst) (as in 3 Hebrew MSS, omitted as meaning an individual being with the background of potentiality: "a soul of cattle" (MT) becomes "a beast" (LXX), but the LXX adds "and it dies," thus rendering the idea of striking a soul to death. Cf. my Nephesh, p. 127, and cf. below 1/3, for this 194</page><page sequence="15">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX indicated in I/1 that the verb naphash is expressed twice by a compound of psychein and once by pauein (or katapauein). Now the various translations of the noun can be gathered under four heads. This classification is made from the Greek and not from the Hebrew usage. a) The first series deals with the texts concerned with longings, either physical (appetite, need) or moral (desire, hope). In Deut. xxi 14, the phrase is not very different from Deut. xxiii 25 and Jer xxxiv 16; in the latter text there is a kind of pleonasm in both the MT and the LXX: to send them forth "free, according to their soul" (i.e., at their own disposal). Deut. xxiii 25 speaks of eating grapes "according to thy soul," and the LXX agrees and emphasizes the idea of filling or satisfying the soul understood as stomach or appetite. But in Deut xxi 14 it seems that the MT chose one of the two words of Jer. xxxiv 16, whereas the LXX chose the other one: "thou shalt send is not merely an omission); Num. xxxi 19 (idem, for "to kill a soul" becomes absolutely "to kill"; cf. also p. 208, n. 2); Ex. i 5 (2nd) (redundant); Is. xxvi 8 (perhaps omitted or perhaps rendered by the pronoun in the conjugation of the verb; cf. below 1/3); Jer. lii 29, 30 (lst and 2nd) (verses omitted in the LXX); Pry. xix 2 (three verses passed over); xxiii 7 (text is different; perhaps "meditate (shacar) in his soul" is understood as "hair" (se'ar) in his throat," then "he swallows a hair"). From those of the omissions which may be purposeful, rather than merely a gap in the text, it is possible to see that the LXX understood nephesh exactly in the line of interpretation I have proposed in my book, even if it sometimes took this word in a meaning different from the MT (as in the last text). 2) Sometimes the LXX (AR) reads psyche, but this word is omitted in variants: 1 Kings ii 4 (haplography by homioteleuton B, and the parallel "heart" makes sense enough); Deut. xiv 26 (haplography by homoioteleuton B); Jon. i 14 (idem S*+); Ps. cvii 9 (2nd) (second use is omitted by parallelism in R); cxliii 3 (first part of the verse omitted in B+, perhaps by parallelism with the second part: "he has crushed my life to the ground"). 3) On the contrary, sometimes the LXX (AR) omits psyche, but variants restore it: 1 Kings xvii 22 (A and Origen restore the MT, instead of a shorter text); 2 Kings xii 5 (A and Origen try to follow the MT more closely); 2 Sam. xix 6 (4th) (last use, omitted because of parallelism, restored by A+ 0247 L+); 1 Sam. xvii 55; xviii 1 ter, 3 (A, according to HR, Origen and Lucian, according to AR, restore nine verses omitted by B); Lam. iii 24 (3 verses passed over by BAQ, but are found in QmgR); Job xvi 4 (2nd) (omitted as redundant, thanks to the possessive pronoun, but restored in A+): Ez. xxvii 31 (the whole verse is omitted, but restored in A); plus the reconstitution made by Origen: 1 Kings xvii 22; 2 Kings xii 5; and 2 Sam. xix 6 (4th) (cf. above); Esther vii 7 (restores the omitted expression "about his life"); ix 16 (restores the similar expression, perhaps expressed by Ceautois which Origen retains; cf. 1/3 below); Job xxx 16, xxxiii 20; and xxxiii 28 (lst) (complete passages); or by Origen and Lucian: cf, above for 1 Sam. xvii 55, xviii 1 ter, 3. As is clear, these suppressions and recon- stitutions do not give any hint about the meaning; I note them merely to exhaust the possibilities. 195</page><page sequence="16">D. LYS her out according to her soul/free." Even if this is not exactly a translation but the choice of a parallel word from such an implicit pleonasm as in Jer. xxxiv 16, the Greek word shows that nephesh really means desire and longing as the center of the personal decision and freedom of the being; and HR does not hesitate to say that the Greek word eleutheros is here the translation of lenephesh (HR does not place a question mark, as it is done elsewhere, beside such an identifi- cation). This confirms the interpretation "desire," and not, for Jer. xxxiv 16, the alternative possibility of the individual reality 1). In Deut. xxiv 15, "to lift his soul to" means "to desire," "to long for," and is translated in the LXX as "to carry hope" in such a thing. (Cf. Is. xxix 8, second occurrence, where psyche is kept as the subject of the verb "to hope.") In Prov. xxiii 2, the phrase ba'al nephesh is translated "very in- satiable," which is precisely the meaning I ascribed to the Hebrew text. The same word, aplestos, is used in Prov. xxviii 25, confirming my interpretation of "broad of nephesh" as "having a big appetite" (and not "broadness of mind"!). But B and S did not accept this rough image and translate by apistos, "unbelieving." (Note that a similar expression, but with lebh instead of nephesh, is found in Prov. xxi 4, where the LXX translates by "pride," and in Ps. ci 5, where the LXX again uses aplestos but keeps "heart" instead of introducing "man" as it did in Prov. xxviii 25. Nephesh or lebh is not exactly "man," but the center of appetite, covetousness, or pride.) I have indicated in the last note how it is possible to go from the MT to the LXX in Prov. xxiii 7: to meditate (shd'ar) in his soul be- comes "to swallow a hair (sei'r)." The meaning is then different here from the MT ("in himself"), but it is easy to understand in that nephesh is basically the throat, as I have shown in my monograph. This will serve as an introduction to section d below. Deut. xii 15 could be mentioned here: "in all the desire of thy soul" becomes "in all thy desire." As is clearly seen, whereas the Hebrew word emphasized the reality of soul as the center of appetite, the Greek translation expressed the idea of the individual. This text might be better placed in group c. Likewise Is. xxix 8 (lst) will be studied in group d, since it reads not "his soul (i.e., stomach, center of appetite and longing) is empty" but "the dream is vain." b) The second series deals with the idea of (i) potentiality, vitality, and (ii) its localizations. 1) Cf. my Nephesh, p. 153. 196</page><page sequence="17">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX (i) My hypothesis about Prov. xxiii 7 presupposed a transition between appetite and localizations related to the place through which food passes, but which was not yet the center or manifestation of life. Another transition is presented by Prov. xxxi 6, where "the bitter ones of soul" becomes "those in pains" (note that in Prov. xiv 10, with a similar expression, the LXX follows the MT). This is to be understood as feelings, but the MT was probably stronger. As I have shown in my book 1), this bitterness is not based on any irritation of the throat, but rather it means that somebody is at grips with death. Accordingly, this was vitality and not merely feelings. Also, Is. xix 10, studied in I/2/A/a, can be added here; in the second part of the verse, the LXX translates the MT pleonastically, with two parallel expressions: "they will be grieved" and "they will be pained in souls." We can see a similar ambiguilty in both the MT and the LXX in Ju. xvi 16 and Num. xxi 4, where "nephesh is shortened" means "impatience"-because the human breath becomes quickened and gasping during the emotions-but note that the former text puts this in relation with death, emphasizing the idea of vitality and potentiality. The LXX translates this expression by oligopychein, meaning literally "to have little breath," "to be short of breath." Consequently, though this rendering is not exactly word for word, it is not different from the MT and uses a parallel root. It is noteworthy that in Ju. x 16, B keeps the MT exactly (psyche plus oligein), while A uses the compound verb as did the latter two texts (cf. Part II for the uses of this derivative of psyche); and Zech. xi 8 (lst) uses psyche but changes the image by using barynein which normally translates kdbhedh and evokes "weight" rather than "shortening." The whole series of Josh. x 28, 30, 35, 37 (lst), 39; xi 11 offers the translation pan empneon. This is always in the singular, as in the MT (with the exception of x 37 in A); but the article is never used, as it is in the MT for all passages except x 39 (but in x 37, A uses the article as well as the plural). Two things can be concluded. First, nephesh is understood on the basis of the idea of respiration and life: "every soul" means "every breathing being." It is noteworthy that this same Greek word translates neshdridh in Josh. x 40; xi 11, 14; and in Deut. xx 16, for a similar purpose; a "soul" is specified as this vitality of respiration. Second, since the article is not used, we are 1) Nephesh, p. 126. 197</page><page sequence="18">D. LYS even farther than the MT from the primitive idea of the soul of the group, from which I thought the MT was already liberating itself 1). It is not "all the potentiality which was in the town," but "every living being," which emphasizes once more the importance of the individual 2). This introduces us to group (ii), since "every breathing one" means that basically the vitality of life is in the breath. (ii) We now meet the rendering of nephesh by a "localization," a physical aspect (cf. Prov. xxiii 7 above). In Jer. li 14, "the Lord has sworn by his arm" (as in Is. lxii 8, MT), the emphasis is on the strength, the potentiality, which is completely present in the arm for a powerful action 3). This is in the line of the general meaning of the MT, though in this specific text the MT should be understood as the personal pronoun, viz., "the Lord has sworn by himself." Two passages are translated by "hands" (plural). In Ps. xli 3, we find that the charitable one is not given to the hands, i.e., to the power of his enemy, instead of not being given to their will and pleasure. In Prov. xiii 4 (2nd), "the hands of the diligent are in activity," instead of "the appetite of the diligent is satisfied." In both cases the meaning goes from desire to action; in the former in order to express the same idea, in the latter with a different purpose. Once more this rendering confirms the general interpretation of nephesh which I presented-if not the specific one in these passages. Is. xliii 4 has "to give princes for thy head," which is the same sense of individual life as the MT, and which is parallel in both texts to the personal pronoun. Perhaps the individual aspect is now more emphasized, since it is clear that "head" is less impersonal than "potentiality." But precisely here when the TlXX wants to specify this individuality, it gives up "soul," which does not have this character of individuation (as for Plato). What makes the person is not so much "soul" as "head." The next text makes the transition to the next group (c). In Gen. xxxvi 6, Esau leaves with all his family and the bodies of his house, 1) Nephesh, p. 136. 2) In Jos. x 32 this expression is omitted by the LXX. The same holds true for Josh. x 37 (2nd), but here it is slightly different: x 37 (lst) did not translate exactly as the other passages, in spite of the similarity in the MT, but added Cosa plus the verb "was" (let us note also that x 28 ABC adds the relative pronoun Co plus the verb "was"); so that only cosa en is used in 37 (2nd). 3) Cf. Nephesh, p. 67, concerning the fact that the soul is not divided into fragments according to all its various localizations, but is totally present in each of them. This is why I put "localizations" in quotation marks. 198</page><page sequence="19">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX instead of the souls (MT, also plural). This is the same meaning and confirms my interpretation of the word as "persons," "folks." The emphasis is on the physical reality of the individual, not the material, but the bodily reality, including here flesh and soul, the whole being. Of course it would be possible even in dualism to indicate "people" by "bodies," but here we see that there is no opposition between soul and body since nephesh is translated by soma. We are far from the pessimistic pun, soma/sema 1). The last localization is the most striking, though obvious. Prov. xxiv 12 speaks of the maker (LXX; read Hebrew verbysr instead of nsr, MT) of nephesh, translated bypnoe, "breath." This could be related to Jos. x 28 ff., discussed above in (i), meaning the vitality of the breathing being. This is also the breath of life, and insists on the fact that "soul" is "respiration" and is also "created" by God, not an eternal substance. Moreover, this also indicates the whole being (and the MT without correction reads: "He weighs the hearts . . . and watches over thy soul," i.e., he knows everybody and then he knows thee), which reminds us of Gen. ii 7, when Adam is animated by the respiration breathed by God and becomes a living nephesh, a being. This is why "all breathing" in Josh. x-xi, on the basis of the vitality localized in breath, means "every living being." We are introduced now to group c. c) Here nephesh is translated in terms of being, self, personal or reflexive pronoun. This is the most numerous group and includes more than half of the texts which express nephesh by a word other than psyche. This quantity is suggestive, and it confirms the general move- ment from the MT to the LXX as I have tried to delimit it above, putting an emphasis on the individual reality, and it also confirms the general movement throughout the MT itself. Two texts translate with aner (cf. also Prov. xxviii 25, above, in section a). Gen. xiv 21 reads: "give me the nephesh/the men, and the 1) We saw above, I/2/A/c, that Gen. xii 5 uses nephesh in the same way as a collective singular, and is translated by psyche also in the singular, but with the addition of "all"; cf. below, Gen. xiv 21. Let us note that Ps. cvi 15 speaks of a disease (MT) or fullness (LXX) in their "soul" speaking in terms of potentiality, then feelings (MT, disgust) or appetite (LXX); but the modern French translator Louis Segond speaks of the decaying of their body. Let us add Prov. xvi 24: MT speaks of "sweetness of the soul and health to the bone" (i.e., body), but the LXX uses only one expression and speaks of "healing psyche." Is this a compound of the two Massoretic expressions, or is psyche used for speaking of "body"? (HR place a question mark after their identification of psyche with nephesh here.) 199</page><page sequence="20">D. LYS property/the cavalry take for thyself." The latter collective singular is translated also by a collective singular in this interpretation, but the former becomes a plural. A group of people is not just a unity of potentiality but-according to the OT itself-a gathering of various individuals; and precisely the nephesh, i.e., what is alive, does not become a certain number of personal psychai (though we know this would be possible), but more typically "men". The other text is Prov. xvi 26, in which "nephesh of laborer" becomes "man in labors." The emphasis is now on the individual more than on the power and appetite (parallel with "mouth" in the MT), and this harmonizes the verse with w. 27, 28, 29, where ish/anjr is used regularly. Perhaps Prov. xiii 4 (lst) is to be placed here: "The soul of the lazy one desires, and nothing" becomes "every lazy one is in desires" (i.e., "has desires"). The idea of appetite or covetousness or longing gives place to the individual; the soul of a lazy one, any lazy one. Another text that may be added here is 1 Sam. xxiii 15, where David saw that Saul sought his nephesh (life). The LXX translates by repeating the proper name, putting the stress on the individuality rather than on the vitality. Such a repetition is curious (though avoiding any gram- matical confusion about the possessive adjective), so that Lucian uses merely the pronoun auton 1). This introduces us to the world of the pronouns. The personal pronoun several times takes the place of nephesh plus possessive suffix. In Deut. xii 15, "all the desire of thy nephesh" becomes "all thy (sou) desire," so that the idea of appetite, desire and will is now secondary with respect to the fact that we deal with "somebody" (and this text could not be classified above in group a!). Num. xxxi 50 no longer has the nuance of primitive potentiality -or at least life-in speaking of atonement which is made "for us." Though the verb in Job xviii 4 differs in the LXX from the MT, it seems possible to relate soi to naphsho (taken as a 2d person by modern versions-but not KJ-as well as Vg, in agreement with what follows), meaning in both texts, "himself/thyself" (but Vg is in favor of "life"). In Ezek. xiv 14, nephesh plus possessive suffix is not trans- lated, but this is not an omission in that it is included in the verb, inflected in the LXX. Ez. xiv 14 in the MT is not very different from verse 20, since the same verb is used in two active though different conjugations (respectively piel and hiphil). This is retained 1) According to HR (Suppl. I), but not indicated in AR. 200</page><page sequence="21">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX by the LXX as far as v. 20 is concerned, but v. 14 is read in the passive form: not "they will save their life," but "they will be saved." This occurs in the pattern of v. 16 in both the MT and the LXX. In Job xxx 25, naphshi is parallel to the personal pronoun of the inflected form and is related to the feelings. In the LXX the parallelism becomes identity, with the two verbs in the first person singular, and ego at the head of the verse for the whole. Perhaps in Is. xxvi 8 also nephesh (without possessive suffix) is now the personal pronoun in- cluded in the verb-unless there is merely an omission as BH suggests. Anyway, such an omission is possible precisely because the implicit personal pronoun of the verb is sufficient, and the nuance of "longing" is secondary. I have already indicated the alternate reading of Lucian auton in 1 Sam. xxiii 15. Note also that Is. xlvi 2 uses autoi (plural) instead of naphshdm (singular plus plural possessive), which follows the meaning of the MT but loses the nuance of potentiality 1). Job xxiii 13 avoids the anthropomorphism tying nephesh and desires and reads autos instead of "his soul" as the subject of "desires." Though Ez. xxxii 10 offers a rather different wording, "they tremble each one for his life" (MT) can be compared with "they wait for their fall." Auton is not just expressing the passage to the plural in a more consistent grammat- ical construction but "their fall" may be understood as the translation of the implicit "the fall of their lives," or may merely come from the confusion between nphsh and nphl (in which case this text is to be classified below in d) 2). The reflexive pronoun of the 3rd (and incidently 2d) person singular is the most frequent translation. In Amos vi 8, the Lord swears no longer "by his nephesh," but "by himself." In Esther iv 13, "think not in thy nephesh" is rendered by "say not to thyselJ" (seaute, dat.), in spite of the fact that Vg links "soul" to "save!" Esther viii 11 and ix 16 offer almost the same expression in the MT as well as in the LXX, though they do differ a bit from each other, in that "to stand for their nephesh" becomes "to help, to succor themselves" 3) (respectively contracted and regular form) (but cf. below, II/1A/a, the addition of Origen). In Ps. cv 22, "in his soul," meaning "at his pleasure," is for the same 1) Cf. Nephesh, p. 159. 2) I owe this last hypothesis to my friend and colleague, Otto BETZ, to whom I am indebted for reading my manuscript. 3) Meaning "each other," according to the translation of the LXX published with the Greek text by Samuel Bagster and Sons, London. But this reciprocity does not seem necessary; cf. below, p. 208, n. 1. Vetus Testamentum XVI 13 201</page><page sequence="22">D. LYS precise meaning translated 'os 'eauton (cf. section a above). Job xxxii 2 speaks of justifying his nephesh/'eauton, i.e., himself. Prov. xv 32 a says that he who rejects instruction despises his nephesh/beauton (we shall discuss below in Part II the extra psyche in b for lebh). On the contrary, he who gets wisdom loves his nephesh/'eauton (Prov. xix 8). Prov. i 18 is different in the MT and the LXX, though the same idea is expressed; perhaps it may be said that the whole verse of the MT is summed up in 18 a in the LXX, and that both "for their blood" and "for their souls" is now rendered by 'eautois. More than ever nephesh is understood as the self. Even though the rendering is not always accurate for the special nuance of such or such a text, the general meaning of the MT is perfectly understood and expressed by the LXX, speaking of the individual being. Nephesh means the self, the individual; but this personal reality is not what dualism calls "soul," since precisely then this word is avoided, and another word is used! d) I place in an extra series those texts where the LXX rendering is completely different from the MT. I shall try to trace the reasons for such interpretations, in order to see what the implicit understanding is, and, consequently, to confirm or invalidate my own interpretation. I have already indicated above, I/3/A/a, texts such as Prov. xxiii 7, where the Greek translation differs from the MT through reading se'dr, "hair," instead of shd'ar, and then interpreting nephesh according to its etymological meaning as "throat," hence "to swallow." (Cf. also above Ez. xxxii 10 in I/3/A/c.) Is. xxix 8 (lst) reads not "his soul is empty," but "the dream is empty." The context speaks of the sleeper who dreams he eats and drinks, and the Greek translation uses the same image but avoids the materialistic meaning of "soul" as "stomach" in concluding that such a dream is vain. In Lv. xxiv 18, "the smiter of a nephesh of cattle" becomes "the one who smites a beast, and it dies." Nephesh does not seem to be translated; in fact, as I have said in my book 1), "to smite a nephesh" means "to strike somebody to death." Nephesh is at the same time the potentiality and the individual being, so that the LXX is satisfied to say "a beast," (and avoids "soul" for it-but cf. Gen. ii 19, ix 10 and Lv. xxiv 18b!) but is obliged to add "and it dies" (the same holds true for v. 21 about man, without nephesh, on the pattern of Ex. xxi 12 in both MT and LXX, but also for v. 17 about man, with nephesh translated 1) Cf. Nephesh, p. 127. 202</page><page sequence="23">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX by psyche). We may compare the absolute use of "to kill" in Num. xxxi 19 instead of "to kill a soul." Prov. xxviii 17 speaks of a "man charged with the blood of a nephesh," which becomes "a man charged with a murder." This interpretation reflects the ancient belief that the potenti- ality of life is in the blood and also that nephesh indicates an individual being, just as was seen in the former example. In Job xi 20, "expiring of nephesh" becomes simply apoleia, "destruction," showing that we deal with the exhalation of the last breath and not with the separation of an external or eternal soul 1), whereas in xxxi 39 the LXX follows the MT and shows that the meaning of this expression is attenuated to simply "sighing," exactly as I said in my book for both texts. We are left now with more difficult texts. In Esther ix 31, "soul" seems to correspond to "health" in the LXX (HR, p. 1380!), unless "for their soul" (and "for their seed") should be related to 'eautois kath 'eauton (then in c). Job xxvii 8 (LXX) reads pepoithos, and this idea of prayer and trust may come from the MT if it is corrected to ndsd' nephesh, "to lift up the soul," then "to long for" (also Peshitto; cf. BH). Or perhaps it would be better to relate the Hebrew phrase to the Greek "he will be saved," and to correct the MTyeshel to ydsha' ? I have already noted, I/3/A/a, that in Prov. xxviii 25, B and S read rehabh-nephesh as apistos, "unbelieving," instead of the more consistent reading of A. It seems impossible to make anything of such texts as Job xxxi 30, where the LXX differs from the MT, and Is. iii 20, which is as complex in its technicality in Greek as in Hebrew and which has a special order that makes any identification of the famous "houses-of- soul" quite difficult. B To this study must be added some other texts, which fall into two groups. a) First, there are two passages in which the LXX translates nephesh by a word other than psyche, although psyche itself occurs as a variant reading in some texts. In Ju. x 16, the image of the "shortened soul" is expressed by oligopsychein in A (as in Ju. xvi 16 and Num. xxi 4; cf. above I/3/4 section b), while B keeps psyche plus the verb oligoun. More suggestive is 2 Sam. xix 6 (1st), where B O read se, whereas most manuscripts read ten pychein sou. This confirms what was said in section c above; nephesh plus a possessive suffix is understood as the self, and is equivalent to the personal pronoun. The alternate reading 1) Ibid., p. 133, about Gen. xxxv 18. 203</page><page sequence="24">D. LYS for this passage, while keeping pyche in v. 6 (2nd, 3rd), together with the alternate reading or omission of psyche in the fourth occurrence (cf. p. 194, n. 1), and with the singular kept by the LXX for those passages, shows that nephesh is not understood as an individual soul, but as life, even though the self is the meaning toward which the text leads. b) The second group is more numerous, with eleven texts in which the LXX readspsychG but another reading is offered by variants. Two or three passages about longings can be related to section a above. In 1 Kings ii 23, codex A (according to HR and Brook-Mclean- Thackeray, but not indicated by AR) proposes euche, "wish, prayer." Though the meaning is different from the MT, it is easy to understand that Adonijah spoke against (i.e., at the risk and the cost of) his own desire (and not "his life"); nephesh is understood as the center of longings and the source of desires. In Ps. lxxxviii 15 the MT and Codex A read that God rejects the soul, whereas codex B translates: the prayer. Here the meaning, which went from potentiality and vitality to life and self, goes now from appetite, desire, longing, to their ejaculation. One may wonder whether Job vi 7 should be classified here or in relationship with section b(i) about potentiality; the text is unreliable in either case. At any rate it is not difficult to pass from the meaning "my soul cannot be allayed," with the sense either of appetite or of disgust (which is not far from the MT), to the meaning "my wrath cannot be allayed." This meaning comes from the understanding of nephesh both as the center of feelings and as the idea of potentiality. Of course, Ju. x 16 can be cited once more here, in regard to codex A. Job vii 15 offers in A+ a text different from the other MSS of the LXX, adding an extra psyche in 15 (2nd) (cf. Part II below), and re- placing psyche by zoe in 15 (lst). Though the LXX differs from the MT, the meaning of this word is the same, and Zoe is a good alternate reading. In parallel now with section b (ii) above, we meet some "localiza- tions." "Heart" is the alternate reading in Deut. xii 20 (A+), Ps. xciv 19 (S+), and Ps. cxxxi 2 (lst) (A). We find: to eat according to the desire of the soul/heart; the consolation of the Lord soothes the soul/heart; not to exalt one's soul/heart. It seems that whereas in the MT "soul" indicates rather the affective life and "heart" indicates the center of understanding and decision, these readings orient the interpretation toward a more "modern" use of the heart; anyway, 204</page><page sequence="25">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX these are only alternate readings. But even A keeps psyche in cxxxi 2 (2nd), and we shall see in Part II that in Prov. xv 32 (2nd), as noted above (I/3/A/c), and in various other texts, Hebrew lebh is translated conversely by psyche! In Zech. xi 8 (2nd) the feelings are alternately replaced by a more active understanding: S*+ reads "hands" 1). Only one text offers the personal pronoun (section c above), viz., Nb. xxx 14, A+; "to afflict one's soul" becomes alternately "to afflict oneself" (auten). This understanding emphasizes more the reflexive self than the potentiality which may be weakened or mortified. Cf. also the alternate reading of Lucian in 1 Sam. xxiii 15 for "David" (I/3/A/c). We are left with one curious reading of Jer. xvii 21 by A: "watch your souls" becomes "watch your watchers." As in section A/d above, we are far from the MT. It is difficult to interpret the soul as the mod- ern conscience which watches the behavior-and has to be watched by whom? Is it an allusion to the watchmen of Jerusalem, who have to note the movements in and out and who can control severely (or laxly) how the Sabbath is kept? Though nothing is systematic, the alternate readings confirm the general tendency already observed about the interpretation of nephesh as the bodily, individual reality, but not as an eternal substance. I have now to gather the various elements and to draw some conclusions from this first part of my investigation. A few texts have been translated in a certain way because the LXX understood nephesh as the centre of appetite, desire, longings and feelings; five examples are gathered in A/a of section I/3 (plus two others, placed in c and d respectively), and two (or three) in B/b. We may add Ps. cv 22, classified in A/c (pronoun), the meaning of which is related to this first series: "in his soul" = "at his pleasure," translated "as himself," which shows that even here nephesh designates the totality of the being. Cf. also below concerning the three uses of "heart" in an affective way. A few texts concerned the potentiality or vitality: three (or four) times in relation with feelings and six times the expression "every breathing one" in A/b (i); once in relation with feelings and once meaning "life" in B/b. 1) In Ez. xvi 27, where the MT and the LXX speak of "giving to the soul(s) (i.e., desire, will, pleasure) of the enemies," it must be noted that the Peshitto and the Targum read "to the hand." 205</page><page sequence="26">D. LYS More numerous are the "localizations": once (?) "throat," once "arm," twice "hands," once "head," once "bodies," and once "breath" in A/b (ii); three times "heart" and once "hands" in B/b. The text with "bodies" leads us to the most numerous group. Two (or three) texts translate by "man," and one by the proper name. An alternate reading here is the pronoun. One text renders the idea of enumeration by pas, and eighteen use any pronoun (once implicitly in the conjugation of the verb), in A/c, plus one in B/a and one in B/b. We are left with ten (A/d) plus one (B/b), total eleven, that are quite far from the original MT. Of these, five are rather easily drawn from the meaning of the Hebrew text; four are too ambiguous to be of any help; and two are out of range in the present condition of the texts. This analysis, as well as the study of the passing to the plural above in 1/2, which can be also noted here, e.g., in Is. xlvi 2 ("their soul"/ "themselves"), shows the tendency to emphasize the individual reality. Though other meanings can be kept, in a general way they are more or less given up, at least in the wording, in order to underline the physical, personal being. It may be said that the LXX is faithful to the MT, if not in the special translation of such or such a text, at least in the general interpretation of nephesh. When the LXX offers a meaning different from the MT, this is on the basis of another meaning of nephesh and, furthermore, is in the general "line of force" of the dynamism of nephesh. Accordingly, is it not possible to conclude that the soul, which is more and more interpreted as the individual reality, is understood in a dualistic way? Precisely not, since in order to emphasize this line of meaning the word psyche is not used and is replaced most of the time either by a physical "localization" or by a pronoun. On the other hand, the purpose of this replacing is not to keep psyche elsewhere as a dualistic soul, since there psyche follows the various meanings of nephesh. The old potentiality is pushed in the background for the benefit of the whole being. This was what I argued already for the MT 1). We must now look at the usage of psyche for other words than nephesh, and see how this can help to understand what the Greek word means and, consequently, what it may mean when it is merely used as the translation of nephesh. 1) Cf. above, p. 194 note 1, which specifies the passages that omitted a translation for "soul" and why such or such an omission occurred. Let us add that the simple fact that some omissions could be purposely made shows that "soul" was not important as the eternal, immaterial substance of dualism. 206</page><page sequence="27">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX II. THE OTHER USES OF PSYCHE It may be wondered whether the study of the other Hebrew ante- cedents of psyche in the LXX can help to better understand psyche and cast some more light on the texts where psyche translates nephesh. I want to consider first the texts in which nephesh occurs (which I have studied in my book), and in which an extra psyche can be dis- covered. This addition may be of two kinds: either this is an addition to the text, e.g., when a new phrase is added in order to give a clearer meaning, or this is an addition in the text, e.g., when a word of the MT other than nephesh is translated bypsyche. In both cases it is possible to deal with the LXX as such or just with some variants. It may be expecially interesting to look at those additions in the passages where nephesh/psyche already existed, since this will specify or emphasize the meaning of those words. After that I will consider the other extra uses of psyche in the LXX. Of course this will involve all the different derivatives of this Greek root. 1. The nephesh passages A. The additions to the text 1). a) Only two texts present an addition in the various MSS of the LXX. In Is. xxxii 6, an extra psychas occurs in order to have a better parallelism: "the soul of the hungry one and (. . .) the thirsty one" becomes (plural!) "hungry souls and (...) the thirsty souls." Prov. xxviii 17a is absent from the MT; this addition in the LXX is in fact borrowed from xxix 17, where word for word psyche translates nephesh. Perhaps this addition in xxviii 17 explains why psyche was avoided for the translation of nephesh in this verse where it has a somewhat different meaning, as seen above in I/3/A/d. b) More numerous are the additions in some variants. In Ez. xxxiii 5, A adds "his soul" as specifying the reflexive form included in ephylaxato (on the pattern of the LXX of Deut. iv 11 and especially 15), unless it is merely a mistake, the scribe copying after the first use of this verb the expression which occurs after the second and is here the direct object of the next verb. In Gen. xlvi 27 a third pschai is added by R at the end of the verse before the last figure, on the 1) I do not take account here of the passages in which the LXX has an omission but variant MSS restored the original MT meaning (cf. above, p. 186 note 2 and p. 194 note 1). Such additions in the Greek MSS, made in order to com- plete what is missing, are not helpful for my purpose. I consider only the ad- ditions in the Greek text with respect to the Hebrew. 207</page><page sequence="28">D. LYS pattern of the first part of the verse (according to HR; this is also the text adopted in the edition of Bagster, but AR says nothing of that). In Hag. ii 13, "if somebody defiled because of a soul (i.e. corpse)," receives in AQW*, after "defiled," the addition "unclean soul." Then we have the idea that the soul of the believer is defiled by the soul of the dead, though "soul" is used each time for the whole being. This emphasizes more the potentiality in the ritual of purity than the individuality-just as in the Priestly School. In Esther ix 16 (but not in viii 11), O+ adds "about their soul" (i.e., "life", singular!), thus explaining that it was a matter of life or death when the Jews succored themselves 1). In Job iii 20, A adds psyche for parallelism: "Why is light given to those in bitterness of soul, and life to the souls in griefs?" Nothing new appears in these texts. But Job vii 15 offers in A+ a curious addition. The text reads now: "Thou wilt separate my soul (but A+ has "my life"; cf. above I/3/B/b) from my spirit, and my soul from my body." Is it a consistent trichotomy? Rather, it seems that the parallelism leads to taking pneuma as "breath" and not "spirit"; then the being is no longer alive when soul/life is cut from the body or the breath. In any case, this is so far from the MT that it is difficult to speak of translation. B. The additions in the text. a) In Num. xxiii 10, "let my soul die the death of the righteous ones" becomes in the LXX "let my soul die in the souls of the righteous ones." This "in" may mean "among," "in the midst of," and then "with." The second part of the verse, though different in Hebrew ("end") and in Greek ("seed"), emphasizes the similarity of fate. This addition merely insists on the fact that the souls are mortal 2). 1) This addition may lead to taking the plural pronoun as reciprocal, as in the translation of the LXX published by S. BAGSTER and Sons; cf. above, p. 201 note 3. This addition may also be understood as a translation of "for their nephesh" (MT) and then would be placed in I/3/A/c or I/31B/a. But there is no such addition in viii 11. 2) It may be interesting to note how the LXX translates some texts in which the MT says that the soul is to die. In 1 Kings xix 2-4, the LXX follows the MT: Jezebel wants to make the soul (i.e., life) of Elijah as he made the soul of the prophets of Baal, then Elijah flees for his soul, and "he asks his soul to die," saying "0 Lord, take my soul." For this last sentence the LXX adds "from me," but this way of speaking does not necessarily indicate any dualism or exterior soul, as I have shown in my book, pp. 125-126 (about 1 Kings xvii 21-22), 133 (about Gen. xxxv 18, translated in Bagster's as "her giving up the ghost"!). 208</page><page sequence="29">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX Ps. lxxiv 19 b, in a kind of parallelism, reads "the souls of thy poor ones" instead of the MT, "the life of thy poor ones." The passage of "life" (singular) to "souls" (plural) is in the general line noted above in I/2/A/a. But above all we have here an indication that the LXX uses psyche in the Hebrew sense of "life." This is parallel to the "soul" of a dove in the MT, though the LXX reads the first part of the verse: "Do not give to the beasts the soul who praises thee." In particular this is the reciprocal-for the same reason-of a text such as Job vii 15 a where A+ reads toe instead of psyche/nephesh (cf. I/3/B/b). Incidently, about Jer. xv 9 the LXX confirms-nominative!-my assertion, p. 154, that "soul" is the subject and not the direct object as in Gen. xxxv 18. Furthermore, in the LXX as in the MT the same verb, "to take," is used in v. 10 and v. 14 as well as in v. 4, and these passages show that such a phrase does not mean literally to separate and appropriate an element out of the body, since v. 10 and v. 14 deal with a simple project of murder. "To seek and take nephesh" is not to appropriate something but merely to kill. The previous sentence of 1 Kings xix 2-4 is found also in Jon. iv 8, but is here translated: "he renounced his soul." In all these texts psyche as nephesh means "life." In 2 Kings x 24, also, both the MT and the LXX speak of "his soul instead of his soul," meaning to kill some- body who let another person escape. In Josh. ii 13-14, both ask for delivering souls from death, with such an answer: "our souls instead of yours to die/death." Let us remember the various texts of Josh. x-xi where nephesh is translated by empneon and is smitten and killed (x 30, 37, xi 11; and in x 35, the LXX goes further than the MT, in speaking of "killing" instead of "banning"). In Deut. xxii 26, both the MT and the LXX read "to kill a soul" (the same verb is used for Ex. xx 13 and Deut. v 17!). But in Num. xxxi 19, the MT reads "whoever having killed a soul," while the LXX does not translate nephesh and uses the verb absolu- tely. This means that "soul" is understood as "a person," and to kill a soul has nothing to do with a dualistic interpretation. We have already seen (I/3/A/d) that Lv. xxiv 18, "to smite a nephesh," is interpreted as "to strike somebody and he dies." Obviously "soul" was avoided neither to be refused to a beast, in Lv. xxiv 18 (cf. Gen. ii 19; ix 10; and Lv. xxiv 18b!) nor to be kept as immortal sub- stance in dualism, in Num. xxxi 19 (cf. the other texts here). In spite of the magical background of Ez. xiii 19, where the MT and the LXX speak of "killing souls who should not die," it is clear that "soul" means "person"; and both say that the sinning soul shall die: xviii 4, 20. Finally let us note that in Lev. xxi 11 and Num. vi 6, the nephesh characterized by death (cf. my book, p. 164) is trans- lated by a finished, dead, soul. This shows that the MT did not mean the soul of a dead one. It is not necessary to speak more about nephesh meaning "corpse" and translated by psych (e.g., Lev. xix 28; xxi 1; xxii 4), but it may be noted that in Lev. xxi 5 where the MT has no specification about the purpose of shaving unlawfully, the LXX adds epi nekro, showing the way in which they understood nephesh even when following the MT exactly by translating with psych. On the other hand, in Ez. xliv 25, "to a dead man" is translated "to a soul of man"; but in the MT, "dead" placed before "man" means "a corpse" and is not an attributive adjective, which is the role of "man," meaning that the corpse is human. This is in the line of the MT, and Num. xxiii 10 now goes also in this direction. 209</page><page sequence="30">D. LYS Three passages use pyche to translate a word indicating a part of the body; this is the reciprocal of the texts studied in 1/3 about some "localizations." In Prov. xiii 25, the first part says that the righteous has enough to eat and satisfy his "soul," i.e., appetite, or stomach; in the second part the parallel in the MT is beten, "belly," which is translated by psychai: "The souls (note now the plural!) of the wicked suffer want." Once more the LXX takes "soul" in one of the Hebrew meanings, not only in understanding nephesh but also in using psyche. In Prov. xv 32 a, as seen in I/3/A/c, the LXX replaces "his soul" (MT) by "himself"; but in 32 b the one who accepts rebuke "acquires heart," meaning "understanding," "wisdom," in the MT, while the LXX says that "he loves his soul." As proposed by BH, it is possible to go from the Hebrew to the Greek verb in reading qn' instead of qnh. Then of course "to be zealous for one's life" is clearer than "for one's heart." Regardless, the passage from "heart" to "soul" with the meaning of "life" and "self" (the decisive center of which is precisely the heart) is possible because of the Hebrew conception 1). In Jer. iv 19 it is difficult to decide whether psyche stands for lebh, since there is an extra kardia (HR, who relate the first psyche to lebh, p. 1489, relate both occurrences of kardia to lebh, p. 722, without any comment). It seems that the MT, "my heart is beating," is now translated "my soul is in commotion," and that an extra sentence is added by the LXX as a parallel: "my heart is torn." But this at least shows how "soul" and "heart" are related 2). Two texts occur with derivatives. In Jon. iv 8, before Jonah "asks his nephesh to die" (MT), that is (LXX) "renounces his soul" (i.e. life), he swoons away. This Hebrew verb is translated by oligopsychein, which we have already met in 12/,A/b as the translation of "to be short of nephesh." This proves as I have indicated that this emotion is not just a feeling but the shortening of potentiality, as here to faint. The other derivative is psychros, "cold," placed beside psyche in Prov. 1) Cf. Prov. xix 8, where "to gain heart" and "to love one's soul" are placed together as equivalent, and where the former is translated phronesin and the latter 'eauton. 2) By homoioteleuton, this whole passage with the first psyche and the second kardia has disappeared in S*+. The same problem of identifying psyche with lebh occurs with Is. xliv 19 (see below, II/2/A/d), in spite of HR, since the text A offered by AR presents the repetition of the first phrase once with kardia and once with psyche, while the edition of Bagster has only psyche (B). But in both A and B there is psyche, corresponding to the MT meaning, which is why I do not classify this text as an addition. 210</page><page sequence="31">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX xxv 25: "as cold water is agreeable to a thirsty soul (...)." Perhaps this juxtaposition is intended as a pun, though now there is a loose relation between "soul," based on "breath" but here meaning the being with his needs, and "cold" coming from "cool breath" but here applied to "water." b) Among the variants, Ps. lvii 7 reads: "They have prepared a snare for my feet," in B as in the MT, while S reads "my soul" (in the accusative!) (HR, but not AR). This is merely an interpretation of the MT, since the snare is for taking the life, in parallel with the bowing down of my soul in the continuation of the verse. (Cf. Ps. cv 18 where both Hebrew and Greek have a parallel according to which the feet are hurt in fetters and the "soul" is passed into iron; the RSV translates with "neck," from the meaning "throat," while a note in Bagster's edition proposes "body.") For two texts in Job xxxiii pyche is proposed instead of "life" in both the MT (hyh) and the LXX (toe). In v. 28 (restored by Origen), my soul is delivered, and my life/soul-according to S2 (HR, but not indicated by AR)-will see the light, whereas in v. 30 we have almost the same text (which differs slightly from MT) and the same alternate reading-according to ASCVt (AR and HR). This is to be brought together with Ps. lxxiv 19 above in II/1/B/a (and Job vii 15 a in I/3/B/b). We are left with one more text which offers curious variants. In Prov. xxii 23 b, both the MT and the LXX read "soul" with the meaning of "life" (though the text is different in both). V. 23 a reads normally: "The Lord will plead their/his cause," which leads to conclude either (MT) that he will despoil of life those who despoil them, or (LXX) that thou shalt deliver thy soul safe. But instead of "cause" A reads dike, which is not so far from krisis, but S*+ reads psyche: "The Lord will judge his soul." This is no longer the judicial cause, but its origin and meaning. "Soul" is the center of desires and decisions, as well as the potentiality and life. The Lord will defend the cause of the poor ones; not only will he judge the meaning of their actions, but he will protect their life which is crushed (cf. v. 22). This curious variant is in line with the Hebrew meaning. 2. The other uses of the Greek root A. Psyche This Greek word is the rendering of various Hebrew words (other than nephesh), that may be placed under six headings gathering sixty- 211</page><page sequence="32">D. LYS two passages 1) to be added to the seventeen studied in point 1 above. a) Only one text is to be considered here, Lev. xvii 4, where psyche translates 'ish: "This man/soul will be cut off from his people." Of course the LXX follows the usual pattern for such an assertion, normally speaking of a nephesh/pyche; cf., e.g., Lev. vii 25; xviii 29; and implicitly xvii 10. On the other hand, xvii 9 and xx 3 translate 'ish by anthropos. In fact in xvii 4 we have the reciprocal of Gen. xiv 21 and Prov. xvi 26 studied above, I/3//Ac, where iephesh was translated by aner. At the very least those various translations show a certain flexibility, which leads to the conclusion that the idea of sacred potentiality is no longer in the foreground and that the soul means not a spiritual substance but merely a person. b) In two texts, psyche is the translation of a Hebrew word for "life" (root hyh). Job xxxviii 39 reads: "Wilt thou fill the life of the young lions," which becomes "the souls (plural!) of the serpents" in Greek. Of course pyche is used there more logically than "life" with the meaning of nephesh related to the stomach and its appetite. This shows, at least, that the LXX is not satisfied merely to follow the MT nor to translate nephesh in this meaning by another Greek expression not using "soul" (cf. I/3/A/c); but the LXX is also able to use psyche in this meaning on its own initiative (whereas nephesh is not used in the MT) for a better rendering of the Hebrew idea. Consequently it uses "soul" in the Hebrew meanings and does not save this word for a Platonic, dualistic reality. The other text, Ps. lxiv 2, offers "life" in its normal meaning. If the LXX translates by psyche, this follows the MT wording of the prayer, "guard my soul," in many passages, e.g., Ps. xxv 20; lxxxvi 2; xcvii 10; cxxi 7 (though with a different verb, shmr); "deliver my soul," e.g., Ps. vi 5; xvii 13; xxii 21 (various verbs in Hebrew); "redeem my soul," e.g., Ps. Ixix 19; God will save the soul of the believers, e.g., Ps. lxxii 13; cix 31. The Hebrew verb used in Ps. lxiv 2 is not used in these other instances, but the sense is much the same. Furthermore, it is used of God in Prov. xxiv 12 (though, as we saw in I/3/A/b (ii), the LXX has a different reading), and of man, but indirectly in parallelism with shmr, in Prov. xiii 3 and xvi 17 (in Ps. cxix 129, nephesh is used with this verb but as the subject). Though the 1) I do not take account of the Greek passages of Daniel, which can be classified as Apocrypha and as such are out of the limits of my investigation. Let us note that there is no use of nephesh in Daniel, and no use of psyche in the LXX (as far as the MT is concerned). 212</page><page sequence="33">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX Greek verb used here is different from that of Ps. lxiv 2, it is used elsewhere for the translation of the other verbs of salvation which we find in the quotations above, with the exception of shmr. I can conclude that the LXX read Ps. lxiv 2 on the pattern of many other passages of the MT where nephesh is used with the meaning of "life" in the expectation of salvation. It is clear in Hebrew that the matter is not to save a substantial soul, and then in Greek that psyche in place of "life" (MT) is not such a substantial soul, but is used in the Hebrew meaning. Of course the LXX elsewhere uses other Greek words, especially zoe, for such a translation. I have noted above in II/l/B/a that Ps. lxxiv 19 b also uses psyche instead of the root yh, and in II/1/B/b that Job xxxiii 28 and 30 (cf. also vii 15 b in II/l/A/b) offer the alter- nate reading zoe/psyche for rendering the same root. Moreover, in I/3/B/b it was indicated that in Job vii 15 a A+ offers the alternate reading joe instead of nephesh/psyche. The conclusion about this flexi- bility must be the same as at the end of point a above. c) Two passages translate rzabh by psyche. The first is Gen. xli 8. I have shown elsewhere ') that rzah is based on the primitive idea of potentiality (just as nephesh), but means a precarious vitality when applied to man and, on the contrary, a vivifying (or destructive) power when applied to God. In Gen. xli the latter occurs in v. 38 and the former in v. 8. Perhaps the LXX chose to translate the latter by pneuma and to render the former by psyche precisely in order to distin- guish between these two different kinds of vitality. If this is the pur- pose, it shows that "soul" is understood as the weak potentiality and psychology of man, even of the Pharaoh who is supposed to be a god, and not as divine substance as in Platonism. (Elsewhere, e.g., in Gen. xlv 27; Ju. xv 19; 1 Sam. xxx 12; 1 Kings xxi 5; Daniel ii 1 and 3; Ps. lxxvii 4, the LXX is able to keep pneuma in this human, pre- carious meaning, so that it cannot be concluded from Gen. xli that pneuma is kept as meaning the divine human reality. This word also must be refused any quality as a divine substance when applied to man!) If it is purposely used in Gen. xli, then there is only a contrast in the same chapter. The second text is Ex. xxxv 21. Though rzuab is taken here in good part for man, meaning a good disposition and decision, it is trans- lated by psyche. Perhaps this is for the parallel with "heart" as in the Deuteronomic expression. But perhaps also the purpose is the same 1) Cf. my book R4,ach (p. 181 note 2 above), e.g., p. 55 ff. 213</page><page sequence="34">D. LYS as was supposed in the last paragraph, viz., a contrast with God's spirit in v. 31. The same conclusion must be drawn. Far from pre- senting psyche as a divine reality when rendering ruah, the contrast in these two chapters distinguishes psyche from the divine reality. And it must be added that nephesh is never translated by pneuma, which could have given it a divine dimension. This introduces us to the next section, where psyche translates "heart." d) This section offers twenty-five instances. The figure itself shows how easy it was to take one word for another, which is the reciprocal of what occurs as an alternate reading in Deut. xii 20; Ps. xciv 19; and cxxxi 2 (lst), as seen above in I/3/B/b. In 2 Kings vi 11, the heart is troubled. The heart is the decisive center of the whole being, so we are not far removed from Gen. xli 8 where ruah occurred as seen above in c (though the verbs are different both in the MT and the LXX), and "heart" can be considered as the privileged "localization" of "spirit." In both texts the LXX translates by psyche which is more the whole potentiality and psychology. Of course, the meanings of both words are not very different, and it seems that the LXX understands the meaning of nephesh and offers a more impersonal statement. In several passages of Chronicles, "heart," as the center whence decisions come, is replaced by "soul," as the (Hebrew) whole poten- tiality of the living being. This means that the totality of the being is involved in such a decision. Indeed, in 1 Chr. xii 39 (lst and 2nd), the singular in both the MT and the LXX reminds us of the ancient idea of the soul of a group 1). See also 1 Chr. xvii 2; 2 Chr. vii 11: to do what is in one's heart/soul; 1 Chr. xxii 7: something is with one's heart/comes on the soul to somebody. In 2 Chr. ix 1, where the Queen of Sheba tells Solomon all that is in her heart/soul, this means her potentiality, which is endangered by so many questions (as said in 1 Kings x 5 for another moment), rather than her feelings. Similar to this series of texts is 2 Chr. xv 15, where the oath is made with "all their heart'/with "all (their, A) soul"; but this may be an alternate choice by the MT and the LXX respectively in the complete Deuteronomic expression of v. 12. The same holds true for 2 Chr. xxxi 21. In all these texts, as well as 2 Kings vi 11, the more general potentiality replaces the more specific decisive center, i. e., the whole being is involved. This is too typically Hebrew to seek for a Greek 1) Of course, the translation shlm by eirenikos is a mistake; the soldiers are going to make David king not in a peaceful but in a total, complete heart, and the parallel says "in one heart," i.e., unanimously. 214</page><page sequence="35">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX explanation, and the Deuteronomic phrase emphasizes that. "Mind" would be a good translation for "heart," but "soul" is even broader. In 1 Chr. xv 29, Michal despised David in her heart/soul. In the parallel text, 2 Sam. vi 16, the MT is identical and the LXX here reads "heart" as the MT, which shows that the alternate reading is not so important and that both words are more or less interchangeable. The expression does not mean merely "in herself," but indicates the center of affectivity, feelings, or love, since love is a unity of soul-potentiality 1). The LXX translation of 1 Chr. xv 29 may go back to this original idea. On the other hand, the idea that the soul is the source of desires is the reason for the LXX translation of Ps. xxi 3 (though S 2 preserves kardia, according to HR). The translation goes back to the old Hebrew meaning and is not in favor of the interpretation of psyche in a dualistic sense. The meaning of vitality, life, appears in several texts, sometimes less and sometimes more consistently than "heart"; cf. Ps. xxxvii 15, where the sword enters into their heart (MT and ABS2), but "into their soul" according to S1; Ps. Ixix 21, where the MT and the LXX are somewhat different, but heart/soul means the vital center which is crushed by reproaches (S keeps kardia). One more parallel in Ps. lxix 33 emphasizes this interpretation; the MT has "let your heart live," but the LXX (AR), "let your soul live," or B+ "you shall live." (Cf. nephesh/psche in v. 19.) Two passages are found in Proverbs. Prov. xxvi 25 speaks of the man in whose heart/soul are seven abominations (but A keeps "heart"), which represents, respectively, the decisive center which is planning a bad behaviour and the whole potentiality which may be in communion or in opposition. Prov. vi 21 is rather curious. The MT offers in parallelism two "localizations" about where to bind one's father's and mother's commandments, viz., "heart" and "neck" (cf. Deut. vi 8, with the same verb in both the MT and the LXX). The LXX replaces "heart" by "soul," either because they are interchangeable or because "soul" is a better parallel to "neck" thanks to the meaning "throat," still visible in the OT. The emphasis is on the whole potentiality of the being. (Cf. other uses of psyche for nephesh in v. 16, where the LXX avoids the MT anthropomorphism, and 26 = life.) 1) Cf. J. PEDERSEN, Israel, Its Life and Culture, I-II, p. 279. 215</page><page sequence="36">D. LYS Nine passages in Isaiah offer "soul" in the LXX for "heart" in the MT, replacing the decisive center of being by the broader meaning of potentiality. In vii 2 (1st and 2nd) we find: the heart/soul of the king and the heart (singular)/soul (singular) of the people quivered/ went out. The LXX is stronger than the MT (cf. Ct. v 6, where the verb is different, with the same meaning, in Greek; in 1 Kings x: 5, where the MT has this strong idea with ruah, the LXX merely has: "she went out of herself"), but consequently the image is inconsistent and another, different verb is necessary in Greek for the continuation of the verse instead of the repetition of the same verb as in MT. In vii 4, the heart is timid/the soul is weakened. In x 7, the LXX differs slightly from the MT; the first lebh becomespsyche, meaning a reflection made by the whole decisive power, while the second becomes nous, meaning merely "his mind will change" (instead of the MT, "to destroy is in his heart"). In xiii 7, as a parallel to the hands becoming feeble, the MT speaks of a heart which melts and the LXX of a soul which dismays. The merry-of-heart/of-soul sigh, according to xxiv 7, which is more than feelings-the whole potentiality is now endan- gered1). In xxxiii 18 "thy hand/your soul (singular plus plural suffix) will meditate terror" (meaning not "to plan" but "to remember"). In xlii 25, "he did not place it on heart/on soul," meaning to take something seriously, as involving the whole decisive center or the whole potentiality. In xliv 19, we have: "he does not return toward his heart"/"he has not considered in his heart" (AS)/"soul" (B) (but cf. above, p. 210, n. 2), whereas in v. 20 the LXX follows the MT for "heart" and "soul" which occur together with different meanings as, respectively, decisive center and life or self. In all these texts, "soul" is interchangeable with "heart," though the meaning of the latter seems more active, and the meaning of the former seems broader. It is clear enough that the conclusion of this section must be that since the LXX goes back to more original Hebrew meanings, it did not understand psyche in a Platonic way at all. This is even more noteworthy in the texts above where the LXX uses psyche, not to translate nephesh following the Hebrew meaning, but, on its own authority, to translate another term of Hebrew anthropology. Psyche had, for the LXX translators, a Hebrew more than a Greek content, even when it did not directly translate nephesh. 1) Cf. Nephesh, p. 126. 216</page><page sequence="37">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX e) The fifth series deals with what can be called the difficult identi- fications 1). Fourteen of the last thirty-two texts can be gathered here. In both 1 Sam. xxiv 10 and xxvi 20, the LXX replaces the MT by the classical expression "to seek the soul" (i.e., the life) of somebody, the purpose being to kill this person (cf., e.g., 1 Kings xix 10, 14; note the use of nephesh/psche meaning "life" in 1 Sam. xxiv 12, and also in 1 Sam. xxvi 21, 24). The two Hebrew expressions are respectively: "David seeks your trouble" (it is easy to pass from this expression to the more common one, especially with the background of this chapter where David precisely does not kill Saul when he has such an oppor- tunity), and Saul came out "to seek a flea." Although the image also occurs in the parallel chapter, xxiv 15, and is respected here by the LXX, it is easy to understand why the classical expression was used in the Greek of xxvi 20; let us note that L+ keeps "flea." It is more difficult to establish the transition between the MT and the LXX in Job xxi 8 and xxvii 4. In the former, "their seed (i.e., children) is established in their presence with them" becomes "their seed (is) according to (their) soul" (i.e., their desire). In 8b the parallel is in both: "and their offspring before their eyes." The transition is from an exterior description to a more interior one, and the kind of pleonasm in 8 a does not make the sense much clearer. But it is obvious that psyche here is used in the ancient Hebrew meaning of desire and longing based on the idea of potentiality, and perhaps also on the common soul of a group. In xxvii 4, what in the MT is a plain parallelism between "lips" and "tongue" which will not lie, becomes in the LXX a progressive parallelism. Instead of "tongue" we have "my soul will not meditate unrighteous things," which leads also towards interiority, in order to give the root of 4 a and to go broader and deeper than 4 a. At the same time, however, the soul is the whole potentiality of the being as well as its personality; the soul is the source of his decisions more than it is what gives him his individual, unique character. 1) I do not follow exactly the distinction of HR between doubtful identifica- tions and words which do not exist in Hebrew. I place in the former group such a text placed by HR in the second, and conversely. Furthermore, as will be seen under the next heading, I divide the second group into three sections, according to whether there is a correction of the MT by the LXX, an addition to the MT by the LXX, or a complete passage absent from the MT. About the latter in Daniel, cf. above, p. 212, n. 1. In both groups e andf, the problem is to try to understand why and how the LXX could pass from the MT to its present reading, and to draw a conclusion about the meaning of psyche, as I tried to do above in other comparisons. Vetus Testamentum XVI 14 217</page><page sequence="38">D. LYS All four texts from the Psalter enter this group. In xxviii 3, "do not draw me with the wicked ones," the suffixed pronoun becomes "my soul" in the LXX, which is the reciprocal of what was seen above in I/3/A/c, and which shows that "soul" obviously is the self, the whole being. Indeed, by this alteration the LXX does not mean the separation of soul and body, since we find "the wicked," not "the souls of the wicked," and since v. 1 keeps the first person singular of the verb about becoming like those who go down to the pit; furthermore in v. 3 S keeps me. In xxxviii 8, the MT and A read "my loins are filled with burning/mockings," while BS read "my soul." It is not difficult to pass from the former, in Greek psyai, to psychai, and then to the singular psyche. V. 8b gives in parallelism "flesh"; it does not seem that "soul" and "flesh" are here the two components of the being. Rather, the soul is "filled," which recalls the meaning "stomach." In fact, this is the whole, endangered poten- tiality; the parallelism is not of the additional kind, but merely a parallelism speaking of the inward and outward being, not of two parts. This was already the meaning of the MT, and "loins" are merely the ancient "localization" of the soul as the power of life. (V. 13 in the MT and the LXX has: "to seek the soul of somebody.") In xxxix 12, "thou consumest what is dear to him" becomes "thou consumest his soul." The transition is likely from the meaning of the Hebrew root of "dear," viz., "to desire," then the affective center which is the source and place of longings (one ancient meaning of soul), and then the soul as the life, the living being. In lxxi 9 the MT and the LXX read: "in the cessation of my strength do not forsake me," but S reads: "of my soul" 1), which obviously shows that psyche was understood in the sense of nephesh as the power of life, the old potentiality, and not as a personal substance of whose immortality or eternity it would be impossible to speak of cessation. God must not forsake me when precisely my soul disappears (not: God must not forsake my soul when I (i.e., my body) disappear). (Cf. v. 10 and 13, about the soul as the life, the self, which is endangered by the enemy.) In Prov. xxiii 24, "he rejoices" becomes "his soul rejoices." The same remark as above must be made about the personal pronoun; "soul" is more the whole vitality, which is positively strong in joy, than just the source of feelings. In Prov. xxvii 23, "know the faces 1) Cf. the three "elements": heart, soul, strength, in the Deuteronomic expression, e.g., Deut. vi 5, 2 Kings xxiii 25 (though the LXX translates with different words the same Hebrew words for "heart" and for "strength"). 218</page><page sequence="39">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX of thy flock" becomes "know the souls of thy flock"; the MT meant "their look," "appearance," and ultimately "state" (KJV), "condi- tion" (RSV). The LXX rendering does not mean, as in S. Bagster, "the number of thy flock" (as when today we speak of a town of 2,000 souls), but it probably means "the needs of thy flock," as in xii 10 1). Once more this is possible only because of the Hebrew meaning. In Is. i 16, "remove the evil of your deeds" becomes "remove the iniquities from your souls," which may be understood as the source of action. Furthermore, the Hebrew m'llykm was perhaps read by mistake m'lykm, meaning "from on yourselves," which is easily translated "from your souls" since "soul" and a personal pronoun are interchangeable as meaning the self, the whole being. (This is different from the anthropomorphism of v. 14.) It is more difficult to explain how, in Isa. xiii 2, "to wave the hand," "to call with the hand" (MT and LXX) can become in A+ "to call with the soul." Perhaps there was no concern for the image (to beckon), and "hand" was understood as "strength" and translated more strongly by the source of this strength. In Isa. xxi 4, in which the LXX speaks of "soul" whereas the MT has "twilight," the transition is not to be understood from the meaning, but, in my opinion, from the meta- thesis of nesheph into nephesh which yields a parallel with "heart" in 4 a. The last text is Ez. xliv 25 2), "to a dead one of man thou shalt not go to defile," which means "a corpse of man", i.e. a human corpse, although it is translated by the LXX: "on a soul of man." This is in the line of the Priestly School, for whom nephesh means an individual and at the same time the individual considered from the point of view of the purity or defilement of his potentiality more than from the old point of view of the vitality of his potentiality. 3) Here the LXX does nothing more than follow the use of nephesh in the sense "corpse" as translated by psyche in Lev. xix 28; xxi 1, etc. The same conclusion as at the end of section d) holds true here. f) We are left with eighteen texts which more or less offer additions to the MT by the LXX. But some of these are texts in which perhaps the LXX merely tried to correct the MT in order to give a clearer meaning. If so, then we have some occurrences of psyche which can show the understanding of this word, thanks to its use for under- standing the context. E.g., 2 Sam. xvii 3 (MT) speaks of "to seek a 1) Cf. my Nephesh, p. 191. 2) Cf. above, the end of note 2, p. 208. 3) Cf. Nephesh, p. 175. 219</page><page sequence="40">D. LYS man," with the verb bqsh and the idea of killing this man, but the LXX completes the reading as in the classical expression "to seek the life (nephesh) of somebody" and uses psyche for this purpose (the other corrections it made in this verse do not matter here). This going back to a Hebrew expression shows that psyche is understood in the Hebrew meaning of "life." Prov. xviii 8 (LXX) offers a text different from the MT, but akin to xix 15 in both the MT and the LXX; it now reads "the soul of the effeminate will hunger." This is based on the Hebrew meanings stomach, appetite, and potentiality to be restored. A link with the MT may be the word beten, "belly." Let us note that v. 7 uses nephesh/psyche for the personal reflexive pronoun, the self. The LXX keeps the MT variety. Prov. xix 19 b is very obscure in the MT. It matters little here how the alteration offered in the LXX was carried out; it is more relevant to note that the Greek expression, "he will abandon (i.e. lose) his psyche," once more takes "soul" in the Hebrew meaning of "life." So it is all the more noteworthy that "soul" is also used in other verses of this chapter and is translated by the reflexive pronoun in v. 8, by psyche in v. 16 and xx 2, with the same meaning, by psyche also in v. 15, about appetite and hunger, and also in v. 18 where the MT, "to desire," receives the nuance of "pride" (by reading hamitho as from rum, rdmdh, with the idea of "high," "exalted"; passage from h to r?). We have here, then, the variety of meanings typical of the MT. And when the LXX adds one more use of psych, it is a somewhat different meaning but yet in the MT line, even the most typical. Two texts can be considered as transitional between this first group and the next, which is correction or addition. Job xxiv 7 in the LXX is not merely descriptive but explanatory about the miserable condition of the poor ones. Yet what is relevant here is that 7 b speaks in the MT of "cloth," but in the LXX of "the cloth of their psyche," which means "their life" whose potentiality is to be protected against coldness. But the image is good if we deal with the whole being, and then the translation of Bagster's edition is well-chosen: "their body" (cf. above, p. 199, n. 1, the French translation of L. Segond for Ps. cvi 15). Prov. xii 14 a reads in the MT: "from the fruit of the mouth of the man, he will be satisfied (with) good." Here the LXX ties "man" with the verb and specifies "soul" before it: "from the fruits of the mouth, (the) soul of (a) man will be filled (with) goods." The Greek verb is even stronger than the Hebrew one, and "soul" here does not mean "each" but "the stomach," "the belly." 220</page><page sequence="41">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX The second group consists of passages which present an addition in the text in the LXX with respect to the MT. E.g., Deut. vi 6 receives such an addition in order to complete the Deuteronomic expression, "those words (. . .) will be in thy heart and in thy soul" (cf. v. 5). In Deut. xvi 8, which is about the seventh day of Passover and the pro- hibition of any work, the LXX adds, "except what will be done for a soul." Here the meaning is not clear but the dative means "for" rather than "by," which would not make any sense. Is it a liberal interpretation of the law in favor of the love of the neighbor (rather than the care of a corpse)? Or does this exception deal with cases in which one's life is in danger, or merely with the provision or cooking of the daily food necessary for one's life? 1) Anyway a Hebrew meaning seems to be required. In 1 Kings xvi 33, about the abominable, ungodly behavior of Ahab, the LXX adds, as a kind of commentary, that his soul (i.e., his life; himself) should be de- stroyed. Job i 5 describes the pious man offering sacrifices for the con- tingent sins of each of his sons, and here the LXX adds, in a kind of parallel explanation, "and one calf for sin for their souls." This last expression is parallel to "according to their number," meaning probably that a calf was sacrificed for each son. Of course, the idea of the potentiality defiled and to be purified is not absent from this use, just as was seen in the MT about the Priestly School. Regardless, "soul" means the whole individual being before God and not merely a sacred part of it. In Prov. xxii 20 the text differs in the LXX, which speaks of the recording of counsels not by the teacher but by the pupil, and adds alternately "on the table of thy heart" (AR)/"of thy soul" (BS+). This alternate reading sends us back to section d above. The end of Hab. iii 2 offers an alteration which can be explained, according to BH, by reading not the MT rabem but rzihL In fact, since the LXX also speaks of "mercy," it would be better to suppose that rzhz was dropped by the MT because of its similarity with rahem. If this explanation is right, we are sent back to section c above. Note that this soul is troubled because of God's wrath; this means that "soul" is man's potentiality. The addition in Hag. ii 9 is an explanation of the gift of shal1m ("prosperity," RSV, more than "peace," KJV): "and peace of soul for possession (or, salvation) for every builder to raise up this temple," which is either to get something or to preserve one's life. But this addition shows how to excite people to build the 1) I am grateful to Otto BETZ for the last two suggestions. 221</page><page sequence="42">D. LYS Temple by a promise. In spite of the translation by eirene, this shalom of soul means that the potentiality of such a man will be full, complete, which is precisely the Hebrew meaning 1). Prov. xii 13 can be considered as transitional toward the third group. Just before the verse studied above as a transition between the first and second group, the LXX adds after its translation of v. 13 another double-lined verse, making with v. 13 a kind of chiasmus. Thus, to "in the sin of lips there is a snare for (or, is snared) the wicked" (MT)/"through the sin of lips a sinner falls into snares" (LXX) the parallel is now in the last element of the chiasmus, viz., "he who contends in the gates will afflict souls." This "affliction" (Bagster's) is not just a sad feeling, for the Greek verb, ekthlibo, actually means "to crush." The parallel in the LXX shows that the souls who are crushed are none other than the disputer's, though the plural would lead to the parallel in the MT where the snare seems to be prepared for others if one understands: "there is an evil snare" (slightly different from the LXX). However, the meaning of the soul(s) to be crushed is potentiality, life, living being. Also transitional is Job xxxiii 30, 31 where AV+ add between the verses, in the line of v. 28-30, "to turn away his soul from destruction, to enlighten him in the light of the living ones." This is precisely the Hebrew meaning of the context: potentiality, life, living being. Four passages can be united in a third group, with addition to the text without any necessary link with the MT. After 2 Chr. xxxv 19, the LXX adds a text borrowed from the parallel 2 Kings xxiii 24-27, where v. 25 has the Deuteronomic phrase "with all his heart and all his soul and all his strength." Prov. xiii 9 offers an addition with the same kind of contrast between righteous and wicked as in the MT (but with- out the logical link we met in xii 13). Here "crafty souls" is parallel to "righteous (ones)," which means that "soul" is understood as "in- dividual, responsible being." The addition of Prov. xxii 9 speaks mysteriously of taking away the soul of the possessors, but this is (with another verb) the classical Hebrew meaning of taking the life, killing (not separating the soul from the body as two different com- ponents) (cf. 1 Kings xix 4, 10, 14). The last text is Lam. i 6, where the LXX exactly follows the MT, but where S + adds by mistake the second line of v. 11, saying that food is necessary to restore the soul, i.e., the potentiality, the vitality, the life of the being. 1) Cf. J. PEDERSEN, op. cit., I-II, p. 263, and L. KOEHLER, Lexicon, s.v. Cf. above, p. 214 note 1, about 1 Chr. xii 39. 222</page><page sequence="43">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX It may be said that in the additions more than elsewhere the LXX was free to use pyche in the meaning it wanted, since it was not dependent on a Hebrew original. As far as can be seen, however, it chose to use psyche precisely because of its Hebrew meanings. Once more my conclusion at the end of section d holds good. B. Derivatives Two of these were met at the end of I/1/B/a: oligopsychein in Jon. iv 8 and psychros in Prov. xxv 25. a) The idea of refreshment is linked with the family of the verb psychein, used in this way in six texts, all of which seem to be mistead with respect to the MT 1), viz., Num. xi 32 (instead of "spread out"); 2 Sam. xvii 19 (the same error here leads to taking the Greek in the meaning of the Hebrew verb-perhaps the transition between both verbs is that to spread out something means to ventilate and then to refresh or cool it, and not, as Bagster's proposes for Num. xi 32, to refresh oneself biologically or psychologically); 2 Kings xix 24 (instead of "dig," in parallel with "drink"); Jer. vi 7 (lst and 2nd) may be related to the same root, but are probably related to another, meaning "cold" (which explains the former misreading); Jer. viii 2 (as for 2 Sam. xvii 19). PsJchos translates the same root, "cold," as in Jer. vi 7, in Gen. viii 22; Job. xxxvii 9; Ps. cxlvii 17; Zech. xiv 6 (but BS*QW have here psyche!). Psychros was also studied previously (Prov. xxv 25). Psygmos is used in Num. xi 32 (cf. above); Ez. xxvi 5, 14; and xlvii 10, always to translate the same Hebrew root, "to spread." This refreshment (expecially of nets, in Ez.) is ventilation more than repairing (as Bagster's suggests for Ez. xxvi 5). Psykter is used twice in Ezra i 9 for a vessel to cool wine. All these instances are linked with the idea of freshness or coldness. The basic idea at the root of psyche is "breath," "to breathe." None corresponds to any form of nphsh, but there is a certain parallelism in the starting point. b) Several compound derivatives are but rarely used. For instance, eupsychos in Prov. xxx 31 (different from the MT) means "full of courage," "bold." Ekpychein occurs in Ju. iv 21 (A) in order to describe the ek-spiration, the last breathing before death. This com- 1) I shall not indicate in this section b) the variants of the derivatives unless they are directly relevant for the purpose of my study. 223</page><page sequence="44">D. LYS pound verb shows that such a text as Gen. xxxv 18 was rightly interpreted in this way (and not as the separation of a substantial soul from the garment-body). This view is confirmed by Ez. xxi 12 where the MT reads "all spirit will faint," but the LXX makes an addition and is stronger, "allflesh and all spirit will expire." In Gen. xviii 4, katapsychein is used to mean "to rest," that is "to refresh (oneself)." These instances are now related to the biological meaning of psyche, either boldness or last breath. This is the potentiality which is positi- vely strong or which needs to be renewed or which disappears in the last breath. Once more there is no correspondence with the root nphsh, but the meaning of these uses of the Greek root are in this Hebrew line. c) The next derivative family gathers anapsyxis, anapsyche, anapychein. In Ex. viii 11, anapsyxis translates rewd.hh, of the family of rgah; meaning "respite," "breathing space" 2). Here the background of nephesh and rgah is the same, viz., breath. It is now possible to breathe, to be restored by a fresh air. This is the same idea as in 2 Sam. xvi 14 with nephesh, physically, and 1 Sam. xvi 23 and Job. xxxii 20 with rzgah, psychologically. We shall see that the first two texts are translated with anapsychein while the third uses anapauein. We know (cf. above I/1) that those two verbs are not far from each other. Let us add that in Is. xxviii 12 another Hebrew word for "rest" is translated with anapauma by the LXX, whereas Aquila uses anapsyxis. Anapyche has a similar meaning and is used in translating Ps. xlvi 12 where the reading is probably corrected from the MT rewaydh, "satura- tion," into rewdhdh, as above 3). In Hos xii 9, "I have found wealth for myself," it translates "wealth." But Hebrew 'on means "power," so that it is easy to pass from the basic idea of power (potentiality) to the means of renewing it (refreshment, in a figurative sense). (Perhaps it is possible to make the same analysis for rewaydh, without correcting it.) In Jer. xlix 31 anapsyche translates betah, "security," which, e.g., in Jer. xxxii 37, is translated by "being confident" 1), and, in Ez. xxxviii 8, 11, 14 (v. 11 is very close to Jer. xlix 31), by "in peace." Anapsych indicates the repetition, the renewal of "soul," i.e., the soul is "at ease," the power of life can be renewed at each moment, hence confidence and plenitude. 1) Cf. my Ruach, p. 21. 2) Ibid., p. 15, n. 4; L. KOEHLER, Lexicon, s.v. 3) The root peithein was used in Job xxvii 8: cf. above I/3/AId. 224</page><page sequence="45">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX The verb anapsychein, "to restore to life by a fresh air," "to recover one's breath," "to breathe," "to rest," translates four Hebrew verbs: 1. bdlagh, in Ps. xxxix 14, meaning "brighten up" 1), and concerning a man who wants to have a moment of rest and quietness, to breathe at ease, before he dies; 2. haydh, in Ju. xv 19 (according to A, while B keeps zen), which is the conclusion of the episode when Samson is dying of thirst, finds water, drinks, "and his spirit returned, and he lived" (I asserted in my book Ruach that here "spirit" is merely the vitality which is weakened by fasting, and this is not far from the basic meaning of "soul" 2); the alternate reading anapsychein places this derivative of psyche near pneyma, and goes in the line I have indi- cated); 3. ndphash, in Ex. xxiii 12 and 2 Sam. xvi 14, in both texts for a moment of rest and renewal of strength 3); 4. rdwah, in 1 Sam. xvi 23, also for breathing at ease and relaxation (of Saul after a moment of madness) 4). All those texts concern the renewal of life, which itself is precarious, easily weakened, and must be restored and strengthened at each moment, especially by resting and breathing at ease, which is both the cause and the sign of such a recovering. d) The last family of derivatives concerns the verb oligopychein, which expresses the idea of "fainting" contained in various Hebrew roots, viz.,'ph, Hab. ii 13; !yph, Jg. viii 4 A; 'tph, Ps. lxxvii 4, where the subject is rzbhi (as a certain way of saying "myself" 5) and once more the words "spirit" and "soul" are placed side by side as more or less equivalent, thanks to the ancient meaning of potentiality; 'Iph, Jon. iv 8 (already studied in II/1/B/a); qsr nephesh, Num. xxi 4, Ju. x 16 A (B reads "his soul shortened," merely separating the two components of the compound verb) (cf. above I/3/B/a and b), and Ju. xvi 16 (and cf. Symmachus and Theodotion for Zech. xi 8), in which impatience is more than a feeling, it is the fact that one cannot stand something, that the vitality is endangered ("to death," Ju. xvi 16; note the anthropomorphism of Ju. x 16 and Zech. xi 8). 1) L. KOEHLER, Lexicon, s.v., "to be gay," "to know gladness," (e.g., RSV) is more positive, while "to be refreshed" indicates more the fact of recovering strength. 2) Cf. Ruach, p. 49. 3) Cf. above, I/1. 4) The same expression occurs in Job xxxii 20 (cf. Rzach, p. 19) and is translated by anapauein. Cf. Ex. xxxi 17, where Aquila uses anapsychein whereas the LXX uses pauein or katapauein, and Ex. xxiii 12, where B reads anapauein instead of A, anapsychein. Cf. above I/1. 5) Cf. Rtuach, pp. 291-292. 225</page><page sequence="46">D. LYS Oligopschia translates the substantive form of qsr but is also used with rzuah, "shortness of spirit," in Ex. vi 9 1). It is also used in Ps. lv 9, where the LXX differs from the MT but introduced the same phrase from r ah. Oligopschos translates six different expressions in six passages: 1 nimhar lebh, Is. xxxv 4, where the verb mdhar means "hasten." This phrase describes a man who is "hasty-of-heart," which does not mean a man who makes his decision rapidly, but a man whose heart hastens easily, that is to say who is disturbed, panic-stricken. This is probably based on emotional movements which are hasty, but it goes beyond mere feelings to the vitality of the living being. 2. ,Qesar-rzuah, Prov. xiv 29, means "impatience" and "anger." This shortening of the breath is in the same line as the hasty movements of the heart. 3. 'Asubath ruah, Is. liv 6, denotes the human potentiality as "stricken." 4. Rz.ah nekhe'dh, Prov. xviii 14, presents the same idea of "striking" with a different Hebrew verb and is translated by oligopschos aner. 5. Shephal-ruabh, Is. lvii 15 (in parallel with dk') 2), suggesting lowering, humiliation, concerns psychology and vitality. 6. In Is. xxv 5, the LXX differs from the MT and speaks (perhaps from the MT's idea of a dry place) of thirsting men who are oligopschoi. This Greek word expresses emotions as shown in the movements of breath and heart and as based on a shortening of potentiality. The Greek root of d is in fact the contrary of what we saw in c about the renewal of vitality. Here we dealt with the shortening of vitality. Rwh and nphsh, used in the MT, are both translated by the compound Greek word oligopych-. This is to be related to my remark about anapsychein in section c. It is typical that the LXX uses these derivatives of psyche in order to express the old idea of weak human potentiality (to be renewed: c!), just as it was the basic meaning of both nephesh and ruiah. This analysis has shown that the understanding of nephesh by the LXX and its use of the root psychj confirm my own interpretation of the MT that I offered in my book Nephesh. When the LXX empha- sizes the individual reality (by using a plural instead of a singular for the "soul(s)" of people in a group, or by replacing "soul" by a personal pronoun), it merely moves in the direction indicated by the 1) Ibid., pp. 205, 303. 2) Cf. Rzach, pp. 159, 224, 226, about the Hebrew verbs of points 2, 3, 4 and 5. 226</page><page sequence="47">SOUL ACCORDING TO THE LXX MT from the Exile onwards. It does not introduce the idea of a personal soul, since it is able to keep (or even to enter) the singular, and furthermore, since it transforms "soul" into physical aspects and conversely. In being farther from the primitive potentiality and nearer to the localized individual, the LXX confirms the MT meanings, either by respecting them in the "translations" (special confirmation), or by interpreting a text with a meaning of nephesh other than the one which is used in this text. In any case, this other meaning is also drawn from the MT (general confirmation). And it is obvious that where the LXX avoids translating nephesh by psyche, it is not in order to reserve psyche for a dualistic meaning, since elsewhere psyche follows the various Hebrew meanings of nephesh (even when nephesh is absent). The LXX never 1) goes in the direction in which "soul" would be understood as opposite to "body" (as in Platonic dualism). Now the question can be raised, why is it so? A first answer could be, because in Greek also the word for "soul" means originally "breath," then "life" and a "living being," an "individual." But two remarks must be made that indicate another explanation. First, in the Hellenistic period, when the translation of the LXX was carried out, the situation of pyche was more complicated. It seems difficult to take for granted that the LXX could have used psyche in its basic Greek meaning, without any reference to its varied philosophical developments. Second, some uses of psyche are related to typical Hebrew meanings such as stomach, belly, appetite, and not only when it is requisite by the use of nephesh but also from the LXX's initiative, when they could have used another word (e.g., Prov. xiii 25, second occur.) 2). In a general way it was noted that the LXX trans- lated nephesh by various "localizations" and conversely used psyche instead of Hebrew "localizations." At the basis the ancient poten- tiality could be easily posited; furthermore, when the LXX changed the meaning of the MT, it used psyche in another Hebrew meaning of nephesh. 1) The only possibility would be the ambiguous addition to Job vii 15 in the variant A+; cf. above II/1/A/b. 2) In his recent book, Before the Bible. The Common Background of Greek and Hebrew Civiligations (Harper and Row, New York, 1962), Cyrus H. GORDON shows that naps-, "soul," means "appetite" in Ugaritic (Kret 127) as well as in Hebrew, and adds that the various Ancient Near East languages use several words for the various aspects of the "soul." He concludes that the four souls (including the appetitive soul) of Aristotle in De Anima do not derive from Greek thought but from a development by Aristotle on the basis of the "soul" in the Ancient Near East (cf. p. 153). 227</page><page sequence="48">228 LYS, SOUL ACCORDING TO LXX The answer to the question raised is, consequently, the conclusive statement that the LXX used psyche in the Hebrew meanings of nephesh. Of course this was possible because of some meanings of psyche which were independent of dualism. But the Greek translation of the Hebrew word seems to carefully avoid dualism and is an ex- cellent, faithful understanding and interpretation of nephesh. This is most important, for it is not only a matter of exact vocabulary but it is a matter of theology. Biblical anthropology exists only in the frame of theology and psychj in the LXX could not be the Hellenistic butterfly symbolizing an immortal soul out of the chrysalis of the body. Such a butterfly would have had its wings burnt at the devour- ing fire of the living presence of the unique eternal Lord 3). 1) I would like to express my gratitude to my friend and colleague Herbert HUFFMON for reading the manuscript and thoroughly revising my English.</page></plain_text>
