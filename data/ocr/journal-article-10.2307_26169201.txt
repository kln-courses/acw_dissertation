Manufacturers responded to the ratings by voluntarily improving the safety of their vehicles beyond the minimum Federal safety standards. In 1996, NHTSA added testing for side impact protection and more recently to assess the vehicle's rollover propensity. After NHTSA's NCAP, other organizations have followed testing the passive safety performance of the vehicles and publishing the results to the customers with the intention of improving the protection given by the vehicles. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) started in 1995 with an offset frontal impact test and in 2002 with a side impact test using a mobile barrier that represents the typical SUV frontend. Also in 1995, IIHS started publishing results from a head- restraint geometry assessment that was complemented with a dynamic test in 2004. In 2009 the IIHS introduced the roof strength test protocol for rollover protection and in 2012 they introduced the small overlap crash test protocol. In Europe, Euro NCAP started its testing program in 1997 with: a frontal offset test, a side impact test and pedestrian protection testing; these were complemented with a pole test in 2000. In 2008, Euro NCAP introduced whiplash testing and in 2009 a new rating system. In this paper, the current European and U.S. legal requirements are presented and compared with the major consumer testing programs: Euro NCAP, NCAP and IIHS.

Table 1. Dummy performance in Directive 96/79/EC LEGAL REQUIREMENTS EC Type Approval To ensure that the European vehicles, their systems and their components meet the appropriate safety requirements, they are submitted to a type approval process, generally called homologation. In this process, a number of tests are performed by a recognized third party, the Technical Service and approved by a Type Approval Body, the approval authority certifying that a type of vehicle, system or component satisfies the relevant administrative provisions and technical requirements of the Regulations. These tests are performed to confirm that the production samples of a design Table 2. Other requirements in Directive 96/79/EC meet the requirements specified in the different regulations. The Type Approval also includes a Conformity of Production (COP), a means of evidencing the ability to produce a series of vehicles that exactly match the specification and performance requirements outlined in the Type Approval documentation. The current European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA) activities related with complete vehicle secondary safety are: • Protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact: Directive 96/79/EC (European Commission) and UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) Regulation 94/02 since 1st of November 2012 • Protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side impact : Directive 96/27/EC and UNECE Regulation 95/03 since 1st of November 2012 The European Union is intended to simplify andharmonize the regulations and the Directive 96/79/EC will be • Protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users withdrawn with date November 1st 2014.

J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 1(June 2013) Table 7. Pedestrian protection criteria applicable after U.S. Self-Certification 24th February 2013 In the United States, the legal approach is different than in Europe and is based on the manufacturers' certification of compliance of its vehicle to all the applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). For this reason, this process is called ‘self-certification’. According to Title 49, Part 567 of the Code of Federal Regulations, vehicle manufacturers shall affix a permanent certification label stating that ‘this vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety, bumper, and theft prevention standards in effect on the date of manufacture shown above’. This label implies that the certification is done on the single vehicle manufactured and not the ‘Vehicle Type’ as in Europe and for this reason the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the vehicle design meets the crash protection requirements specified by the different standards including the possible result variation due to test repeatability and production dispersion. This means that crash tests are just one of the elements necessary to demonstrate vehicle conformity, that have to be supported by other activities such as CAE simulation, sled testing, quality assurance and others. For the purpose of this paper, the following occupant protection requirements in FMVSS will be described: • 49 CFR 571.202a: Head Restraints. • 49 CFR 571.208: Occupant Crash Protection The Antropomorphic Test Devices used in the pedestrian • 49 CFR 571.214: Side Impact Protection tests after 24th February 2013 are the JAMA-JARI - 3,5 kg The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards determine child/small adult headform and the JAMA-JARI - 4,5 kg other requirements that are not considered in this paper for adult headform. the purpose of comparing the legal versus consumer Head Restraints requirements, such as occupant protection in interior impact The current Regulation 17/08 does not include dynamic (49 CFR 571.201), seat belt assembly anchorages (49 CFR dummy testing to verify the head restraints performance in 571.210), door locks and door retention components (49 CFR case of rear impact and only geometric and strength 571.206), fuel system integrity (49 CFR 571.301) and others. requirements are considered. Frontal Impact Table 8 compiles the most significant requirements The Standard FMVSS 208 defines the impact conditions applying to Head Restraint Systems in Regulation 17. with the ranges of velocities and impact angles in which the Table 8. Head restraint systems requirements in R 17/08 passenger cars shall offer adequate protection to the frontoccupants. Car manufacturers shall demonstrate the compliance of their vehicles in any of these conditions. To show the compliance, they usually test the vehicles in a limited number of conditions that they consider the most severe and representative of the others. Table 9 shows a common set of tests and Table 10 the dummy requirements. Depending on the vehicle and its restraint system performance, other tests could be considered necessary to show the compliance with the standard.         </page> <page sequence="5"> Huguet et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 1(June 2013) 5 Table 9. Common tests for frontal U.S. self-certification • Seat belt assembly requirements • Pressure vessels and explosive devices • Airbag deployment risk Side Impact The Standard FMVSS 214 establishes the side impact protection requirements for passenger cars. These requirements are a combination of a static door crush test, a mobile deformable barrier test and two vehicle-to-pole impacts using 50th and 5th percentile dummies. In this paper, for the purpose of legal versus consumer testing requirements comparison, only the mobile deformable barrier and the pole tests will be discussed. In the same way that the FMVSS 208, the FMVSS 214 defines a range of velocities where the vehicles shall offer adequate protection in case of side impact. For this impact Table 10. Performance requirements for the Hybrid III configuration, the dynamic tests usually performed to 50th and 5th percentile belted dummies in frontal impact demonstrate the compliance with the requirements of this tests Standard are: • A Mobile Deformable Barrier (MDB) side impact into a stationary vehicle with a ES-2re 50th percentile dummy in the front seat and a SID-IIs 5th percentile dummy in the rear seat. • 75° Vehicle-to-pole impact from 0 to 32 km/h with a ES-2re 50th percentile dummy in the front seat. • 75° Vehicle-to-pole impact from 0 to 32 km/h with a SID- IIs 5th percentile dummy in the front seat. The MDB used for the side impact weighs 1.367 kg and its line of forward motion forms a 63° angle with the centreline of the test vehicle. The longitudinal centreline of the MDB is perpendicular to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle and is aligned with the vehicle's ‘Impact Reference Line’. In the case of passenger cars, this line is located 940 mm forward of the centre of the vehicle's wheelbase if the wheelbase is 2.896 mm or less, or 508 mm rearward of the centreline of the vehicle's front axle if the wheelbase is greater than 2.896 mm. The deformable element used in these tests corresponds to NHTSA's specifications. The FMVSS 208 also determines other requirements that The performance criteria requirements for the dummies are not considered in this paper for the purpose of comparing used in the side impact protection tests are shown in Table the legal versus consumer requirements: 11:Additional requirements also included in the FMVSS 214 • Labeling and owner's manual information are: • (Airbag) Readiness indicator • Any side door that is struck by the pole shall not separate totally from the vehicle. • Rear seat belt requirements  • Any door that is not struck by the pole shall not disengage  from the latched position.    • The latch and the hinge components of any door that is not  struck by the pole shall not separate from each other or from  their attachment to the vehicle. </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 Huguet et al / SAE Int.

Performance criteria requirements for FMVSS vehicle in four different areas: Adult Occupant Protection side dummies (AOP), Child Occupant Protection (COP), PedestrianProtection (PP) and Safety Assist (SA). With this new rating method Euro NCAP intends to provide global and comprehensive information to consumers, helping them to choose the safest car. Adult Occupant Protection The Euro NCAP Adult Occupant Protection rating is based on the results of the following tests: • Frontal impact at 64 km/h into a 40% offset deformable barrier with 2 Hybrid III 5th percentile belted occupants in the front seats • MDB (EEVC) Side Impact at 50 km/h into the stationary vehicle with one ES-2 dummy in the front seat on the struck Head Restraints side The FMVSS 202a offers two possibilities for the certification of a vehicle: • Vehicle-to-Pole Impact at 29 km/h with one ES-2 dummy inthe front seat on the struck side • Option 1: Dimensional and static performance • Option 2: Dynamic performance and width • Low, Medium and High Severity Pulse Whiplash sled tests Table 12 shows the Standard requirements that the vehicle The Frontal Impact test protocol is based on UNECE has to satisfy to comply with the two certification options.

Standard requirements for the two certification impact is assessed with the criteria shown in Table 13. options of FMVSS 202a The side impact test protocol is based on the UNECE R95/Directive 96/27/EC tests. In the case of the vehicle vs pole test protocol, it is based on the FMVSS 201Standard. For these two tests, the injury criteria considered are shown in Table 14. The whiplash impact assessment is performed using a combination of geometrical evaluations and three dynamic sled tests that simulate rear impacts with low, medium and high severity pulses. These pulses were selected from real crash data as they had demonstrated statistically to generate whiplash symptoms. The geometrical assessment is carried out with a SAE 3D machine with Head Restraint Measuring Device (HRMD) and the sled tests are conducted using a BioRID IIg dummy. Table 15 shows the geometrical and Table 16 the sled tests assessment criteria. The Adult Occupant Protection score comes from each one of the previous sets of tests: frontal, side, pole and whiplash. The maximum number of points awarded for each criteria are: CONSUMER TESTING PROGRAMS • Frontal Impact: 16 points Euro NCAP • Side impact: 8 points The Euro NCAP program was established in 1997 and is now backed by; seven European Governments, the European • Pole impact: 8 pints Commission and motoring and consumer organizations.

If the vehicle manufacturer has recommended two CRS for the dynamic assessment that are not included in the previous list, they will be also included in the assessment using the same installation mode than in the dynamic tests. The score for the installation of CRS is based on the number of CRS from the full list that can be successfully installed in the vehicle considering all eligible seating positions. The following requirements will be considered to evaluate if the vehicle seating position is compatible with the CRS fitted: • Ease of installation in the car • Seat belt mounted CRSs ◦ Ease of fastening seatbelt ◦ Ease of tightening belt (Ease of operating the lock-off clip) ◦ Additional tethers and/or support leg ◦ Obstruction &amp; Stability of the CRS • ISOFIX CRS ◦ Insert and locking ISOFIX anchorages  ◦ Additional tethers and/or support leg </page> <page sequence="9"> Huguet et al / SAE Int.

The occupant protection rating is based on injury risk curves for the head and pelvis. The combination of the different injury risk results in a ‘Joint probability of Injury’ and a ‘Relative Risk Score’ for the pole impact that result in a star rating for the pole impact. Rollover Propensity NHTSA's rollover propensity is calculated in function of the Static Stability Factor (SSF) of the vehicle. This factor is defined as one-half the vehicle's track width divided by the height of the centre of gravity above the road. A rollover risk curve is associated to the SSF which gives a result compared with a baseline and results in a star rating for the rollover test. Additionally, the following dynamic manoeuvring tests for role rate are also performed: • J-Turn • Fishhook NCAP • Slowly increasing steer Frontal Impact Advanced Technologies NCAP's frontal impact tests consists of a full width crash The following systems are also considered for the NCAP at 35 mph (56 km/h) into a 0° rigid barrier with a belted 50th assessment: percentile male Hybrid III dummy in the driver position and a • Electronic Stability Control 5th percentile Hybrid III dummy in the front passenger seating position. • Lane Departure Warning The occupant protection rating is based on injury risk curves for the head, neck, chest and femur for both the driver • Forward Collision Warning and the passenger dummies.

Table 22. Criteria for the structural performance rating Front Moderate Overlap Testing of IIHS moderate overlap frontal impact IIHS moderate offset frontal crash test is based on ECE R94 / Directive 96/79/EC test with an increased velocity to 64 km/h, with just one dummy in the driver's position. The vehicle is assessed in three areas: • Injury measurements • Restraints and dummy kinematics • Structural performance The injury measurements ratings are based in the criteria from Table 21 and the structural performance is rated with the criteria shown in Table 22. Front Small Overlap Testing Table 21. Criteria for injury measurements rating of IIHS introduced in 2012 the small overlap frontal crash IIHS moderate overlap frontal impact test that intends to replicate the impact of the front corner ofthe vehicle with another vehicle or object as a tree or a pole. The movements of the occupants in this impact are not only forward or toward the side of the vehicle like in the moderate overlap and side tests but a combination of both movements. This combined movement represents a challenge for the restraint systems and airbag designs. In this tests the vehicle impacts a rigid barrier at 64km/h with a 25% overlap and a 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummy seated in the driver's position. In the same way as the moderate overlap, the vehicle is assessed in three areas: • Injury measurements • Restraints and dummy kinematics • Structural performance The injury measurement rating is the same used for the front moderate overlap tests while there are differences in the rating regarding the restraint and dummy kinematics. For the structural performance, the assessment criteria are shown in Table 23. </page> <page sequence="13"> Huguet et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 1(June 2013) 13 Table 23. Criteria for the structural performance rating As it is also done in the frontal impacts, the IIHS assesses of IIHS small overlap frontal impact the driver and passenger head kinematics and the vehicle structure in addition to the injury criteria. The Head protection rating depends on the contact or possible contact of the head of the occupants with the vehicle or the barrier. In function of the surface contacted or approached the rating will be good, acceptable, marginal or poor. The vehicle structure rating is based on the minimal residual distance between the B-pillar inner surface after the test relative to the seat centreline before the test. If this distance is more than 125 mm the rating is good; between 125 and 50 mm, the rating is acceptable; between 50 and 0 mm, the rating is marginal and if it is less than 0 mm, the rating is poor. The combination of the Head protection, the Injury criteria and the Structural rating results in an Overall Side Rating for the vehicle. In the same way as the moderate overlap, the combination Rear Crash Protection / Head Restraint of the Restraints and dummy kinematics, the Injury criteria IIHS Rear crash protection / head restraint rating is based and the Structural rating results in an Overall Small Overlap on the results of a geometric evaluation and the dummy Frontal Rating for the vehicle. recordings of a sled test. Side Testing The Geometric rating considers the horizontal (backset)and vertical distance of the head of a 50th percentile occupant IIHS performs a side impact test looking to reproduce the to the head restraint (Table 25). This measurement is carried crash of a light truck against the vehicle. out by positioning a SAE 3D Machine with a Head Restraint This test, carried out at 50 km/h, is performed with a 1500 Measuring Device (HRMD). kg mobile deformable barrier with a shape reproducing the geometry of a SUV or a light truck. For this reason, the Table 25. Criteria for the geometric evaluation of IIHS barrier is higher than EEVC WG13's or NHTSA's and can rear crash protection contact the heads of the occupants. This test is performed with two SID-IIs 5th percentile dummies, both in the struck side of the vehicle, one in the front row and one in the rear. The injury criteria used in this test are compiled in Table 24 Table 24. Criteria for injury measurements rating of The dynamic test assessment is done based on the IIHS side impact combination of the following criteria: • Time to Head Restraint Contact • T1 forward Acceleration • Neck Shear Force • Neck Tension Force The combination of the dynamic and the geometric ratings gives an overall rating for the seat. Roof Strength The IIHS evaluates the roof strength conducting a quasi- static test in a similar manner to the FMVSS 216, introducing some changes such as the testing specification of one side of the vehicle's roof, do not include headroom criterion, testing displacement driven instead of force driven and the specification of the pitch angle during the test based on measured on-road pitch angle. </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 Huguet et al / SAE Int.

IIHS - Insurance Institute for Highway SafetyEEVC - European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee Overall Rating The best performing vehicles in IIHS are awarded with the ‘Top Safety Pick’. To earn it, a vehicle must have ‘good’ ratings in the frontal, side, roof crush and rear protection tests in addition to ESC systems. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS This paper shows the existing differences between the legal requirements and the consumer testing programmes in Europe and the United States. These differences make it necessary for the manufacturers to adapt their development programmes for each specific market. The result of this adaptation is that vehicles in Europe and the United States have differences in their structures, restraint systems, sensors, algorithms, etc. due to the different tests that have been used as targets in the development process. The differences in the restraint systems, such as airbags, are also important due to the differences in the tests used to develop the vehicles (i.e. unbelted tests are not performed neither in legal requirements nor consumer testing programmes in Europe). The table included in the Appendix presents a summary of the different consumer and legal tests in Europe and in the U.S. CONTACT INFORMATION Carlos García Gutiérrez Manager, Passive Safety.
