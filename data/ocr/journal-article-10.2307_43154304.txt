<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS VOL. 27, NO. 1, SPRING 1999 Nietzsche's Zoophobia: How Life Became Literature Barbara D. Massey Chatham College In his now classic book, Nietzsche : Life as Literature , Alexander Nehamas argues that for Nietzsche life was best understood as literary text. Nietzsche's perspectivism in ethics and epistemology should be seen as an outgrowth of an aestheticism that recognizes stylistic pluralism, while retaining stylistic norms. What Nehamas has in mind is this: Nietzsche's effort to create an artwork out of himself, a literary character who is a philosopher, is then also his effort to offer a positive view without falling back into the dogmatic tradition he so distrusted and from which he may never have been sure he escaped. His aestheticism is, therefore, the other side of his per- spectivism. This is the central claim of the interpretation of which this book consists.1 Nehamas offers his interpretation not as the uniquely correct account of Nietzsche but rather as one possible interpretation, and one that he regards as better than the alternatives. Just as Nietzsche aims for an aesthetic, nor- mative pluralism, Nehamas suggests that in the interpretation of Nietzsche's notoriously difficult texts, the correct approach is a careful, critical plural- ism. Nehamas embraces Nietzsche's own view on interpretation, saying, But Nietzsche's views, whatever they are, are not simply there, available for inspection. In order to know what they are we must 147</page><page sequence="2">first, as I have already begun to do here, interpret his texts. And interpretation itself, according to Nietzsche is a highly personal and creative effort.2 For Nehamas then, Nietzsche relies "on artistic models for understanding the world and life and for evaluating people and actions."3 The concept of "style" becomes central, useful for its simultaneous normative and pluralis- tic significance. Since there are for Nietzsche no uniquely true accounts of the world, there can be no privileged position for natural science. Richard Schacht, in his essay "Nietzsche's Kind of Philosophy," has criticized Nehamas 's approach to Nietzsche on the grounds that Nietzsche utilized for models many arts such as music and the plastic arts, not just lit- erature.4 Further, Schacht argues, he did not rely on the arts alone for metaphors or principles. He also made use of material from the natural and social sciences. Schacht takes it that Nietzsche wanted "an expanded repertoire of per- spectives." He wanted "many eyes," as it were.5 So, for Schacht, it is a mis- take to overemphasize the role of biology in Nietzsche's philosophy for exactly the same reason that it is a mistake to single out literature as the prime model or method. Nietzsche draws on physics, neurophysiology, cos- mology, psychology, and economics no less than biology. For Schacht, per- spectivism becomes a methodological pluralism rather than a commitment to aestheticism and aesthetic norms. In this paper, I argue that Darwinian science for Nietzsche is not an "interpretation" of the world placed under the suzerainty of aesthetic norms. Neither is it merely one among many intellectual ingredients blended together to make a multifarious mixture. Although I side with Nehamas 's decision to single out aesthetic norms as special and to a large extent perva- sive, I reject the view that Nietzsche's philosophy aims to be consistently free of dogma, arguing instead that science functions as a sort of dogmatic sub-basement, motivating and providing some justification for the philoso- phy of aestheticism. So Nietzsche embraces, strangely perhaps, a sort of sci- entific realism with a pragmatic perspectivism and, at another level (or in Nietzsche's words, as we shall see, in another "ventricle of the brain"), aes- theticism with aesthetic perspectivism. Nehamas alerted us to Nietzsche's suspicion that the dogmatic tradition lived on to some degree in his philosophy. And Nietzsche's claim that Darwin's account of the origin of the species was "true but deadly"6 is sug- gestive, though not in itself adequate to establish the role of science as a foundation for aestheticism. Such statements about truth must be read in the light of passages such as this one in Beyond Good and Evil: Are these coming philosophers new friends of truth? That is probable enough, for all philosophers so far have loved their 148</page><page sequence="3">truths. But they will certainly not be dogmatists. It must offend their pride, also their taste, if their truth is supposed to be a truth for everyone 7 So one might argue that if Nietzsche regards Darwin's theory as "true," he regards it as "true" for himself but not necessarily for everybody else. In this case, one would see anti-dogmatic aestheticism relativizing and personaliz- ing the claims of science in a way consistent with Nehamas's view of Nietzsche's philosophy. Before turning to the details of Nietzsche's views on common descent, it is useful to examine the following lengthy passage from Human All Too Human which characterizes the tasks of art and science as complementary. In this passage Nietzsche recommends a compartmentalization of scientific thought, separating and preserving it from the norms of art. If this passage can be taken to represent Nietzsche's considered view, then Darwinian sci- ence is not to be relativized by being subject to aesthetic norms. Nietzsche says, Future of Science. - Science bestows upon him who labours and experiments in it much satisfaction, upon him who learns its results very little. As all the important truths of science must gradually become common and everyday, however, even this little satisfaction will cease: just as we have long since ceased to take pleasure in learning the admirable two-times table. But if science provides us with less and less pleasure, and deprives us of more and more pleasure through casting suspicion on the consolations of metaphysics, religion and art, then that mighti- est source of joy to which mankind owes almost all its human- ity will become impoverished. For this reason a higher culture must give to man a double-brain, as it were two brain-ventricles, one for the perceptions of science, the other for non-science: lying beside one another, not confused together, separable, capa- ble of being shut off; this is the demand of health. In one domain lies the power-source, in the other the regulator: it must be heated with illusions, onesidedness, passions, the evil and perilous consequences of overheating must be obviated with the aid of the knowledge furnished by science.8 Here Nietzsche argues that art, religion, and metaphysics must be balanced by a scientific knowledge that is separate from the aesthetic view of the world. This passage goes on to predict "the ruination of science" and "a sinking back into barbarism" if art and science are allowed to mix together. The "two-ventricle brain" is necessary for health and for the continuation of non-barbaric society. This passage is unequivocal in its message that aesthetic standards must be compartmentalized. The results of science must not be judged according to the norms of style: they are not perspectivai in the way that aesthetic 149</page><page sequence="4">matters are. So the "truth" of Darwin's account of the origin of the species is not a "personal truth" that may not be "true" for others. Darwin's account is an objective truth that anyone who is intellectually honest must accept. Are we justified in taking this passage at face value, or do we have here some complex Nietzschean irony? The irony hypothesis must be rejected. Commentators acknowledge that in Nietzsche's early work he does express positive views about science.9 Does Nietzsche retract this endorsement of science and compartmentalization in later writings? Human All Too Human (part 1) dates from 1876-77 before he had resigned his university position and so must be counted as earlier work. Beyond Good and Evil , for exam- ple, is written a full nine years later, and The Genealogy óf Morals appears ten years later. To be sure, no statement can be pulled out of the context of Nietzsche's gradually unfolding views and read in isolation. Given the frag- mentary character of Nietzsche's writing, any attempt at locating a unified line of argument is vulnerable to criticism. For this reason, in my reinter- pretation of Nietzsche's philosophy I imbed this vital passage in a chrono- logically rich array of texts from Nietzsche's corpus. My purpose is to give an interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy that takes seriously the often ignored section 251 of Human All Too Human. I locate a unified philosophy in Nietzsche's cryptic aphorisms, arguing that aestheticism and perspectivism are both consequences of Nietzsche's scien- tific and quasi-scientific beliefs about animals and human animality. Such a search for unity, which characterized Walter Kaufmann 's pioneering writ- ings, has been rejected by more recent scholars (Derrida, Kofman, Danto) who emphasize the undeniably fragmentary character of Nietzsche's writ- ten work.10 1 side with the Kaufmann-style approach to Nietzsche's texts partly because it seems heuristically productive and partly because of my intuition that Nietzsche retained the "rigorous concept of truthfulness" which he characterized as a legacy of Christianity. Nehamas was right when he suggested that Nietzsche did not make a clean break with dogmatism. I. NATURALIZING THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN NATURE The Darwinian theory of common descent and Nietzsche's own views about animals were central to his epistemology and his "philosophy of life." When The Origin of the Species first appeared, Nietzsche was fifteen. He kept track of the ensuing outpouring of quasi-Darwinian, authentically Darwinian, and anti-Darwinian writings. Despite his denial in Ecce Homo that he is a Darwinian (by which he meant, according to Walter Kaufmann, that the con- cept of the Ubermensch is not to be construed Darwinistically as a higher form that will emerge evolutionarily),11 he took the doctrine of the origin of 150</page><page sequence="5">the species, as we have seen, to be "true but deadly." In The Genealogy of Morals he praises British biologists and psychologists (after wondering if they are perhaps "old frigid and tedious frogs") as brave, proud, and magnanimous animals who know how to bri- dle both their hearts and their smarts, and have specifically trained themselves to sacrifice what is desirable to what is true, any truth in fact, even the simple, bitter, ugly, repulsive, unchris- tian, and immoral truths - for there are truths of that descrip- tion.12 Just as the ancient Greeks faced the bitter vision of tragedy, Nietzsche would face up to and make use of the bitter and ugly truth of the origin of the species. Richard Schacht has argued in his essay "Nietzsche's Gay Science , or, How to Naturalize Cheerfully" that in The Gay Science Nietzsche embraces a naturalized conception of human nature.13 In Beyond Good and Evil , Nietzsche offers the following characterization of this project: In effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate mean- ings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal text, homo natura ; to bring it about that man shall hence- forth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the other forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: "Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!"14 Such a "naturalizing" involves reconceptualizing the human in light of the doctrines of common descent and natural selection. The fact that humans are closely related to apes has to be acknowledged. Nietzsche aligns himself with "the discipline of science." He even attempts to debate how the mech- anism of natural selection actually operates. In The Genealogy of Morals, he rejects the notion of adaptation as an account of that which drives natural selection, preferring instead the concept of the will to power.15 In The Will to Power ; he speculates that accidental variation would be incapable of con- ferring advantage. "That higher organizations should have evolved out of the lower has not been demonstrated in a single case I do not see how an accidental variation offers an advantage."16 Nietzsche's doubt concern- ing the efficacy of mutations in evolution echoes the criticisms of Spencer and other neo-Lamarckians. Ernst Mayr asserts that it was not until the so- called "Second Darwinian Revolution" during the period 1936-50 that the role of natural selection in evolution was fully understood and the notion that mutation pressure drives evolutionary change was abandoned.17 In the 1960s, high school textbooks still portrayed mutation as the source of the 151</page><page sequence="6">variations that are subject to natural selection. Despite Nietzsche's failure to understand how natural selection works, it is accurate to say that he accepted the culturally relevant essentials of Darwin's view: namely, the animality of human beings, their kinship with other primates, their origin in natural and not divine processes. As Schacht points out, Nietzsche ulti- mately rejected a "reductionistic biologizing," while at the same time denouncing traditional non-biologized views of human nature as grandiose and dishonest fantasies.18 With fearless "Oedipus-eyes," he acknowledged the fact of human animality. This fact posed a challenge for him in that our animal legacy seemed an inadequate guide to a worthy human life. n. HOW NIETZSCHE'S BELIEFS ABOUT ANIMALS STRUCTURE HIS PHILOSOPHY Unlike the "brave, proud, magnanimous animals who know how to bridle both their hearts and their smarts," Nietzsche could not accept passively what was for him the repulsive truth of common descent. His untamed heart moved him, in his capacity as an ethicist and aestheticist, to design a project for transcending animality and the instinctive herd morality given with our biological inheritance. Arguing along the same lines, Walter Kaufmann points out that Nietzsche felt the need to develop some viable conception of human dignity.19 By revealing human animality, Darwin had rendered tra- ditional concepts of human dignity unworkable. Some commentators have seen Lamarckian themes in Nietzsche's claim that a higher humanity could emerge through cultural change.20 This reading of Nietzsche in itself would constitute no disagreement with Darwin, who himself was not free of Lamarckian speculations. But as Walter Kaufmann has argued, Nietzsche resists any attempt to see the "higher humanity" as a biological phenomenon that emerges through evo- lutionary struggle. It is rather a cultural product of human creativity. Cultural products are not acquired characteristics: the Ubermensch teaching is not part of a theory of evolution. This is what Nietzsche means when he denies that he is a Darwinian. The unchristian, immoral, simple, bitter truth uncovered by Darwin is for Nietzsche undeniable and decisive. Yet Darwin is not permitted to have the last word on what human nature is or what it can become. Nietzsche's ethics and what might be termed "philosophy of life" attempt to heal the wound of Darwin's painful discovery, without indulging in dishonest fan- tasies or giving in to the enticements of "old metaphysical bird-catchers." The doctrine of human animality itself (though for Nietzsche an "unchristian" truth) did not jolt him out of his Lutheran faith, because stud- 152</page><page sequence="7">ies in Biblical criticism had already accomplished that task.21 The death of God was not the pressing issue. What shocked the eyes of Oedipus was the death of the Enlightenment conception of human nature. A Kantian family tree for the human race would show God and the angels as our closest rela- tives with rationality as the defining trait. An atheistic Enlightenment pic- ture would preserve the rationality, the dignity, the noble image of God without the Creator himself. Humans would be radically distinct from lower animals. Nietzsche's greatest challenge, then, was to deal with this "death of Man." He meant to transform it into "the birth of man," as Richard Schacht puts it.22 Loss of the Enlightenment picture of human nature was more painful for Nietzsche than it was for Darwin. Nietzsche's views on the "bestial" deprived him of solace when he contemplated our relationship to other pri- mates. More knowledge of biology might (or might not) have consoled Nietzsche and rendered the attempted flight into transcendence less appeal- ing. As I will show, Nietzsche believed that we, like many other species, have an instinct to herd together, to avoid pain, to abhor pain in others of our kind - these tendencies are judged contemptible by Nietzsche. He believes that these instincts along with our inborn aggression and cruelty make up the total of our biological inheritance. Transcendence is necessary because this inheritance is inadequate to structure a truly worthy human life. So the question of what constitutes our biological legacy is paramount. Out of intellectual honesty, Nietzsche accepted the fact that humans are primates and have instincts similar to those found in related animal species. He found such honesty an unavoidable duty. In The Gay Science, he says, You see what it was that really triumphed over the Christian god: Christian morality itself, the concept of truthfulness that was understood ever more rigorously, the father confessor's refinement of the Christian conscience, translated and subli- mated into a scientific conscience, into intellectual cleanliness at any price.23 He regarded the triumph of what he termed "scientific atheism" as "a gen- erally European event in which all races had their share and for which all deserve credit and honor."24 British biology and psychology receive special praise. His strategy for coping with revulsion and bitterness was to at once embrace naturalism and replace its ugliness with a new spiritual ideal. The drive to transcend the human and achieve a "higher body" could only be launched from the Oedipus-eyed confrontation with human animality. But what conception could Nietzsche have had of animals, one won- ders, for him to think not only that human animality nullified all traditional views on human nature, but that cruel barbarism coupled with a contemptible 153</page><page sequence="8">herd instinct would be uncovered when our connection to our animal ances- tors and contemporary animal relatives was acknowledged? Why does Nietzsche feel compelled to "sunder" us "from the animal past," through culture building and development of social conventions, in order to locate values that can be embraced by an intellectually honest person?25 Nietzsche's bootstrapping project for lifting humans above their bio- logical condition is, in his own opinion, nothing new at all. He believed that even stone age human beings struggled to rise above their innate repertoire of instinctive behaviors. They did not rest content, as do other species. In The Genealogy of Morals sect. H: 16, he speculates that from earliest times human beings have turned against the instincts that guide and protect our animal cousins. Alone among the animals, we are "at war with the old instincts" with an "ego turned against itself." But the struggle with the instincts carried on by our ancestors was arduous without being productive of any appropriate outcome with the possible exception of scientific atheism itself. So the Nietzschean project is not to start a new war against the instincts but to wage the ongoing war with improved strategy and a more accurate understanding of the human predicament. In the flight from the "animal past," one attains a "higher body" and pursues the "ideal of the spirit" but the "beast within" does not cease to exist. One is not simply and exclusively a beast, however. Nietzsche resists the "impoverished picture of ourselves" which a reductionistic biology might seem to present. The human is de-deified through naturalization, but de-animalified through cul- ture building. The process of transcending animality results in the emer- gence for the first time of true human beings, free of fantasy and imbued with worthy values. Nietzsche's reaction to the revelation of human animality presents an interesting contrast to that of Darwin himself. Darwin refused to criticize Christianity for fear of offending his family, but he had lost his faith early on.26 Darwin lives his life as if Christian cultural values are not threatened but confirmed by observations of kindness and care in animal behavior. Though he remarks in his notebooks that he is surprised by the intensity of the struggle for survival among plants and animals even in an apparently peaceful English countryside, he did not believe that the theory of natural selection threatened nihilism: "[114] March 12th - It is difficult to believe in the dreadful «but quiet» war of organic beings, going on the peaceful woods, &amp; smiling fields. . . ."27 Unlike Alfred Russell Wallace, who held onto a remnant of Christian metaphysics in his views on human spiritual uniqueness, Darwin accepted the implications of common descent and nat- ural selection without evasion or revulsion. His book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals studies the gestures, facial expressions, and behaviors employed by dogs, chickens, monkeys, swans, humans, and others. 154</page><page sequence="9">Animals are said to express joy and affection no less than pain or anger.28 Even though Darwin has been criticized by some as anthropomorphic in his characterizations of the emotional and cognitive lives of non-human species, he in no way claims that humans and other animals are wholly alike in their emotions. In a separate chapter Darwin deals with "Special Expressions of Man." He is at pains to discover which expressions are culturally and which innately determined. Still, in the notebooks Darwin ponders the possible equality of other species with humans, "[231] Animals - whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. - Do not slavehold- ers wish to make the black man other kind?» Animals with affections, imi- tation, fear &lt;of death&gt;, pain, sorrow for the dead. - respect . . ."29 The contemplation of possible equality does not cause Darwin to feel self-revul- sion. It is the intelligence and sensitivity of the animals that interests him. He does not find cruelty or cowardice the dominant features of animal life. He adopts an attitude of respect toward all animals, both non-human and human. In The Descent of Man, Darwin considers human morality from the point of view of natural history, an undertaking which he believed had never been before attempted.30 Darwin's estimate of the situation is not unlike that of Aristotle, as James Lennox has pointed out in a recent paper.31 In the chapter on the moral sense, Darwin says this about the biological roots of morality: The following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable - namely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well- marked social instincts, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become well developed, or nearly as well developed as man. For, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them. The services may be of a definite and evidently instinctive nature; or there may be only a wish and readiness, as with most of the higher social ani- mals, to aid their fellows in certain general ways.32 So we learn that social instincts when coupled with higher intellectual pow- ers would seem inevitably and for any animal whatever to result in a moral sense of the sort observed in human beings. This is an astonishing empirical prediction about the biological fitness conferred by moral behaviors for social animals, since Darwin in effect is claiming that any highly intelligent social animal without moral behaviors would fail the test of natural selection. Nietzsche does recognize kindness in animal behaviors. But he sees the instinct to assist others as leading only to the inferior morality of pity. In Beyond Good and Evil , he dismisses European morality as "herding-animal- morality," which gives rise to the contemptible phenomena of democratic 155</page><page sequence="10">society and the pursuit of material comforts.33 Still, a few pages later, Nietzsche claims that the deepest and most essential feature of animal life is aggression: Life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker; suppression, hardness, imposition of one's own forms, incorporation and at least, at its mildest, exploitation - but why should one always use those words in which a slanderous intent has been imprinted for ages? . . . "Exploitation" . . . belongs to the essence of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is the consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.34 Perhaps one might see in this passage no more than Nietzsche describing the phenomenon that Darwin himself dubbed "the dreadful war of organic beings," namely, a competition for resources. But Nietzsche must have in mind something more sinister, for he sees cruelty itself as fundamental to animality. He suggests that the need to survive mandates viciousness in the interactions of "wild beasts." He visualizes our hominid past (and the cur- rent lives of non-human species) with horror. Human beings and apes as well as other animals are basically cruel. In The Genealogy of Morals he says, The sight of suffering does one good, the infliction of suffering does one more good - this is a hard maxim, but nonetheless a fundamental maxim, old, powerful, and "human, all-too- human"; one, moreover, to which perhaps even the apes as well would subscribe: for it is said that in inventing bizarre cruelties they are giving abundant proof of their future humanity, to which, as it were, they are playing a prelude.35 In Beyond Good and Evil , Nietzsche also associates cruelty with animality, suggesting that it may be the most fundamental part of our animal legacy. "Almost everything that we call 'higher culture' is based upon the spiritual- izing and intensifying of cruelty - this is my thesis; the 'wild beast' has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been - transfigured."36 In addition to cruelty, there is also the instinct for altruism. Nietzsche regards altruism as a sign of weakness, a value preached when aristocratic morality decays and the herd instinct emerges. He does not see altruism as a strength, even though it might contribute to survival. In The Genealogy of Morals , he characterizes the approbation typically accorded altruism as a superstition, [T]he word "good" is far from having any necessary connection with altruistic acts, in accordance with the superstitious belief of moral philosophers. On the contrary, it is on the occasion of the decay of aristocratic values, that the antithesis between "egois- tic" and "altruistic" presses more and more heavily on the 156</page><page sequence="11">human conscience - it is, to use my own language, the herd instinct which finds in this antithesis an expression in many ways.37 Of course Nietzsche could not have anticipated exactly how altruism might contribute to fitness and in that sense constitute a strength. As Ernst Mayr reminds us, it was not until 1932 that J. B. S. Haldane suggested that an individual might convey many of its genes to the next generation by assisting close relatives who share those same genes.38 And it was not until the 1964 paper of W. D. Hamilton that the altruism of sterile worker bees could be understood using the principles of population genetics. Hamiliton looked at the role of haplodiploidy to show exactly how the sacrifice of fit- ness by an individual is compensated for by an increase in fitness by close relatives.39 No one in the nineteenth century understood how the altruism of sterile worker bees could be explained by natural selection. This possible counterexample troubled Darwin himself. But Nietzsche did not need to understand inclusive fitness in order to see that cooperation and even polit- ical skills might be strengths deeply ingrained in various species and con- ferring far-reaching benefits. Nietzsche underestimated the depth and richness of animal behavior and animal morality. He believed that he had adequate reason to rule out (without further scientific research) the sort of hypothesis discussed in this volume by Povinelli and Giambrone, who suggest that complex social and political behaviors of humans, to a large degree, may be present in chim- panzees and other mammals, even though these other species lack the abil- ity to conceive of other minds.40 Complex social behaviors, then, may not depend on this ability, as is often assumed. Characteristically human behav- iors, they argue, were probably already present in our ancestors, who lacked enlarged brains with representations of second-order intentions. If Povinelli and Giambrone are right, then most human social behavior is not caused by the sorts of conscious causes that folk psychology would assign. If this is so, then Nietzsche's beliefs about animal abilities are even more inadequate than received views about animal behavior indicate. Had Nietzsche studied Aristotle's natural history, he would have come across characterizations of some non-human species as political animals, who possess in an undeveloped way the "seeds" of virtue and rationality. In Historia Ammalia, Aristotle speaks explicitly about the "seeds" of higher functions observable in animal behavior. For some of these traits differ by the more and the less in rela- tion to man, as does man in relation to many of the animals (for certain of them are more present in man, some more in the other animals), while others differ by analogy; for as art, wisdom and understanding are present in man, so in some of the animals 157</page><page sequence="12">there is some other such natural capacity. Just such a thing is most apparent when we look at children when they are young; for in them it is possible to see faces' and 'seeds' of the states that will be present later in life, though at that time their soul hardly differs at all from that of the beasts, so there is nothing unreasonable if some traits are the same in the other animals, some similar, and some analogous.41 Aristotle goes on to discuss the cooperation of many political animal species as well as the less-organized herding together of animals. He characterizes several non-human species as "political animals," pointing out that only humans beings are perfect examples of this type, since only human beings are capable of deliberation. John Cooper has argued that the attribution of the term "political" to non-human species such as bees and cranes is not equivocal or merely analogous. Rather, Cooper argues, for Aristotle these animals are fully "political," even though they are not the most perfect examples of political animals. And herding species have full-fledged social practices, even though they may not attain to the "political" sort of social organization. The following passage shows a wealth of observational detail: there are also the following differences among animals, that depend upon their ways of life and their actions. Of both footed, winged and swimming animals, some herd together and others live solitarily, while others 'dualize.' And some of the herding ones are political while others live scattered. Now herding ani- mals are for instance (among the winged animals) the pigeon family, the crane and the swan (no crook-taloned bird is a herder), and among the swimmers many kinds of fish, for instance those called migrants, tunny, the pelamys and the bonito. The human being 'dualizes.' Political animals are those that have as their function some single thing that they all do together, and not all the herding animals have that. The human being, the bee, the wasp, the ant and the crane are political ani- mals.42 So Aristotle sees truly political behaviors among animals who are capable of neither deliberation nor the cultural construction of social practices. Aristotle looks to behavior and not any supposed mental causes of behavior in making his judgment on this point. For Aristotle the fundamentals of liv- ing politically and cooperating are given both to human children and to some other species in their biological heritage. It would be beside the point to blame Nietzsche for not agreeing with Aristotle's views on ethics or politics. Still, Nietzsche's beliefs about animal abilities are not in agreement with those of Darwin, Aristotle, or contempo- rary scientists. Frans de Waal's book Chimpanzee Politics , for example, explores the political society of chimpanzees, taking seriously the intelli- gence displayed by these primates.43 Nietzsche's underestimation of the 158</page><page sequence="13">political and intellectual abilities of animals has an impact, as we shall see, on his views about culture and morality. In Human All Too Human , he gives an account of animals that explicitly rules out political and collective abilities: The Three Phases of morality hitherto- It is the first sign that animal has become man when his actions are no longer directed to the procurement of momentary wellbeing but to enduring wellbeing, that man has thus become attuned to utility and pur- pose: it is then that the free domination of reason first breaks forth. . . . Knowledge qualifies him to prefer the most useful, that is to say general and enduring utility, to personal utility, general and enduring honour and recognition to momentary honour and recognition: he lives and acts as a collective- individual.44 Nietzsche's conception of animals is reminiscent of Plato's in the Republic : for Plato animals and most human beings rely on the senses for their opin- ions and are guided only by appetites and enthusiasms. They are not capa- ble of ruling themselves well, because morally worthy political behavior requires rational controls on the emotions and appetites that promote impru- dent choices. Nietzsche's view that animals are at the mercy of their emotions and desires is demonstrated in the following passage on cruelty from Human All Too Human : Cruel Men as Retarded Men. - We have to regard men who are cruel as stages of earlier cultures which have remained behind: the deeper formations in the mountain of mankind which are otherwise hidden are here for once laid open. They are retarded men whose brain has, through some chance or other in the course of hereditary transmission, failed to develop in as sensi- tive and multifarious way as is normal. They show us what we all were, and fill us with horror. . . 45 When we look at our primate ancestors and relatives, we find cruelty because the brain has not developed in a "sensitive and multifarious way." Nietzsche believes then that the behavior of non-human animals lacks order and intelligent purposefulness. If Nietzsche had embraced a more nuanced picture of animal capacities and the human animal heritage, the project of transcendence would necessarily have been conceived differently. To be sure, Nietzsche would not be derailed by chimpanzee field stud- ies that find evidence for love, sympathy, and caring. He would not agree with Frans de Waal, who argues in Good-Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals that the roots of morality lie in the animal tendencies to love, care, and be sympathetic.46 Nietzsche argues that this instinctive morality of "the herd" is exactly that which must be over- come by the true human being, who defines a worthy morality. 159</page><page sequence="14">But evidence for political order in chimpanzee society cannot be swept aside with the same argument. Nietzsche's portrayal of animal abilities leaves no room for complex social practices of this sort. As a result, Nietzsche overestimates the extent to which human social practices are cul- turally constructed. He sees human beings as radically free to choose either cultural values that promote the decadent and Philistine or values that pro- mote the healthy, honest, worthy Ubermensch. Nietzsche does not consider the possibility that our biological inheritance might be intransigent and pre- clude such freedom, or, make it otiose. Transcendence would be pointless, if the values that are innate turn out to pass philosophical and artistic muster. Something of this sort may have motivated Darwin himself, who seemed to consider it appropriate and nonproblematic to live "as if' a Christian gentleman, though committed to atheism. Walter Kaufmann points out that Nietzsche denounced Strauss in the second Meditation for writing as if Darwinism had not undercut traditional Western ethics in a very uncomfortable way.47 But conceivably Strauss knew something that Nietzsche did not. Surely Darwin himself did. Darwin's understanding of animal behavior made him confident that traditional moral values are grounded in instincts that are a result of natural selection, not just for humans but for many species. These instinctive behaviors are not senseless, impul- sive, cruel, selfish outbursts of appetitive brutes. On the contrary, they are well ordered and have stood the test of time. Darwin found much to admire in non-human animals. They expressed affection and joy to be sure, but they also showed intelligence. Even earth- worms showed some intelligence. Darwin did not feel that as a member of the human species that he was or needed to be particularly different from the other species in order to have dignity and live well. Human animality for Darwin does not vitiate human dignity, because animals themselves possess dignity. This is so not because we stipulate this as part of a religion or an ethical system that we invent, but because there is for Darwin empir- ical evidence of animal intelligence, kindness, social cooperation - those same traits which when we see them in humans, we regard as constituting worthiness. m. NIETZSCHE'S SCIENTIFIC EPISTEMOLOGY Even though, as has been shown, Nietzsche in his naturalizing of the con- cept of human nature failed to submit himself to the "discipline of science" to the extent promised, some of his views about human and non-human ani- mals were nonetheless accurate. These views exerted a major impact on his epistemology in particular, which has been called "pragmatic" and has been 160</page><page sequence="15">compared with the pragmaticism of C. S. Peirce.48 1 believe that Nietzsche's perspectivism in epistemology stems from his conviction that human beings are simply animals, without special quasi-divine Reason or access to truth. Nietzsche realized that the obvious fact that all animals must perceive and conceive their environment from one perspective at any given time implies that the perspective of the ideal observer is not available to humans, since humans, it turns out, are after all merely animals. The best any animal can do is construct a provisional account of the world, which stands up to the tests of evidence and the demands of life. This provisional and perspec- tivai character of all accounts of the world is a feature of science just as with less systematic attempts to understand the world. In the case of science, we might label the doctrine "fallabilism" to emphasize the similarity between Nietzsche and Peirce on this point. The traits of truth and justification which Plato associated with knowledge are unattainable because humans, like all other animals, possess a complex body which is embedded in and the prod- uct of the physical world. There is no eternal soul that might perceive eter- nal things with a higher sort of vision. Even if there existed non-perspectival absolute truths, human animals could have no access to them. But there is no reason to suppose such truths exist, since neither God nor anything remotely like God exists. Walter Kaufmann has argued that Nietzsche's notes, sketched just before his death, lay out a pragmatist epistemology roughly contemporary with Peirce 's work, but antedating that of any other pragmatist epistemolo- gist.49 Kaufmann claims that Nietzsche's work in this area was not thought through and not integrated with the rest of his philosophy. I suspect that Kaufmann's evaluation fails to take into account the implications of the naturalizing of human nature. If Richard Schacht's read- ing of The Gay Science is faithful to Nietzsche's intentions, then all of Nietzsche's assertions concerning the search for worthy values, the building up of a truly human nature, the work of the philosophers of the future, must be read in the light of his deep and distressed acceptance of human animal- ity. Since many of the principles of Nietzsche's epistemology, such as per- spectivism and what we might call "fallabilism," follow directly from the acknowledgment of human animality, it is plausible that pragmatism, even if implicit, forms the sinew of Nietzsche's philosophy. In a sense, this acceptance of a pragmatist epistemology would make it necessary that, if, as Kaufmann puts it, Darwin is to be "defied,"50 he must be defied through art and the building of culture. For Nietzsche, life is literature, then, because human animality rules out the traditional philosophical routes of ethics and epistemology for the characterization of humans as more digni- fied than beasts. Not only is Plato's heaven unattainable, even Aristotle's view that human animals have a fragment of divine nous cannot be maintained. 161</page><page sequence="16">Because Nietzsche believes that ethics must be reinvented, that no wor- thy moral values are present in our biological inheritance, and that we are animals whose cognitive options are best characterized by a pragmatist epis- temology, it follows that life-promoting values can be generated only through aesthetic processes. They are then subjected to the test of life in the world. Darwin's own worldview cannot, Nietzsche asserts, pass the test of promoting life: Darwin's scientific vision, though true, is "deadly." The life- promoting and life-transforming model of the higher human nature must be the work of artists, because the scientists have failed. Nietzsche can reason his way to this conclusion, because he assumes that empirical findings about animals are devoid of serious moral significance. Darwin himself does not find his own scientific worldview "deadly," because he does find serious moral significance in the science of animal behavior. Nietzsche's aestheticism, then, is the product of both his beliefs about animals and his meditation on the implications of human animality. Granted that Nietzsche's beliefs about animal behavior were sometimes mistaken, it still must be recognized that Nietzsche's aestheticism has a sort of scientific and empirical foundation. He makes a systematic effort to "bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the dis- cipline of science, stands before the other forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers."51 Nietzsche had contempt for superstition and self-deception. He had respect for science, but believed it to be a fact that nature cannot generate worthy moral values. Only culturally constructed values can provide a wor- thy guide to life. He said that in this task the wise man will compartmental- ize his mind, isolating the scientific from the artistic. Nietzsche approved warmly of the study of natural history as an anti- dote to folly, but he regarded the Darwinian worldview as a deadly guide to life, if taken alone. In the following passage from Human All Too Human , Nietzsche praises science, but this praise must be seen in the context of his claims that Darwinism is "true, but deadly" and that the two-ventricle brain is needed for the good life. How Natural History should be narrated. - Natural history, as the history of the war of the spiritual-moral forces against fear, imaginings, inertia, superstition, folly, and their victory over them, ought to be narrated in such a way that everyone who hears it is irresistibly inspired to strive after spiritual and bodily health and vigour, to an even nobler need for practical activity. Up to now it has not yet discovered its proper language, because artists inventive in language and eloquence - for these are what is needed - refuse to relinquish an obstinate mistrust of it and above all refuse to learn from it. Nonetheless, it must be allowed 162</page><page sequence="17">that the English have taken admirable steps in the direction of that ideal with their natural science text books for the lower strata of the people: the reason is that they are written by their most distinguished scholars - whole, complete and fulfilling natures - and not, as is the case with us, by mediocrities.52 This passage is interesting for several reasons. First, the natural scientists of England are praised as "whole, complete and fulfilling natures." So from Nietzsche's point of view, these scientists have managed to construct wor- thy lives. Second, Nietzsche expresses the opinion that the skillful writing of scientific texts is profoundly important for the building of appropriate cultural values and worthy human lives. Artists who distrust science and refuse to learn from it are called "obstinate." If properly expressed, the claims of natural science are liberating and promote "spiritual and bodily health and vigour." Nietzsche's view might be summed up this way: Since it is up to human beings to invent values, it is important that they carry out this work with a set of background beliefs as accurate as the best available in the cur- rent science of the day. People have always constructed cultural values, but in the past they did not have science to help them avoid folly and supersti- tion. Only by inventing (for the first time in history) worthy values can the Nietzschean philosopher of the future become higher than the beasts. Decisive to Nietzsche's narrative of transcendence are both his knowledge of Darwinism and his ignorance of animals. NOTES 1.
