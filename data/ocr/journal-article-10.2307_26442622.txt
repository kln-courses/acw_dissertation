<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF Death and Modern Literature By FREDERICK J. HOFFMAN SINCE no one has experienced death and survived to describe the experience, the actual nature of death (aside from physical and perhaps psychiatric notations of the degeneration of tissues) must always depend upon imaginative speculation. Much energy has been expended upon the metaphors of death as event and death as beginning. Many of the images attaching to death have long been strati fied and catalogued, but the need for fresh metaphor remains. There are two principal ranges of image which seem always to attach to the phenomenon; one is thoroughly realistic, the other as thoroughly "idealistic." In the one case we have the "memento mori," the conqueror worm, and other parapher nalia of maggotry. In the other case, the imagination strives to eliminate as much as possible the evidences of physical dis solution by substituting for them suggestions of spiritual be ginnings. In other words, we have in this second view the idea of death as transcendence. All transcendental illusions have at their source the desire to deny the corporeal nature of man, even though sometimes physical and natural details are coyly cherished. Both of these approaches to death are brilliantly represented in Thomas Mann's novel, "Budden brooks." Indeed, death as transcendence gives way to death as dissolution as the distinction of the Buddenbrook family declines and collapses. Thomas Buddenbrook's toothache is a signal of the disaster (a collapse of decorum more than of the spirit) that occurs almost immediately after his strenuous bout with his dentist. Of course, this is not all that needs to be said about the</page><page sequence="2">440 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW literary perspective upon mortality. The choice of image and metaphor depends upon current milieu sanctions and determi nants, upon the relative ease or difficulty of belief, upon the nature of man's realization of his condition at any stage of his progress toward death, upon the forcefulness of systems of eschatology. One of the most important of all elements in the literature of mortality is the time-space relationship that for any given sensibility governs a specific human nature. This relationship is indispensably associated with eternity and its effect upon the measurement or the sensing of time. One may say that if eternity is definitely credited, the sense of time will be more easily generalized. That is, a man expecting and be lieving in eternity will be less concerned in his temporal ex periences, will see them less in depth than in linear progres sion towards the beginning of eternity. As the belief in im mortality (which is eternity individualized) becomes less and less certain, more attention is paid to time, and time achieves a spatial quality. The passing of time becomes a spatial ob ject or a succession of objects; it is their spatial quality that attracts and not their sequential nature. An age whose peo ple are little convinced of immortality or little comforted by the hope of it is likely to produce a literature that emphasizes the spatial qualities of life. This literature is also concerned with the density of objects, with their texture, with the spe cific values residing in experiences. If death is a wall and not a doorway, the pace of experience diminishes, the attention to time is translated into an absorption in space, and every detail of change is noted and treasured. Instead of a meta physic dependent upon an infinite extension of the given, we get an ontology of objects and experiences. Death turns us toward life and forces us to admire or cherish it (even though we despair of it as well), to begrudge the passing of time (which is signified by changes occurring in objects) and eventually to despair of conclusions. n The three terms, Grace, Violence, and Self are more than</page><page sequence="3">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 441 adequate as a means of giving a perspective to modem litera ture and death. They form a thematic as well as a chronologi cal order: one may say that the violent destruction of the pos sibilities of grace has forced upon the self the responsibility of adjustment to death. At any rate, there is some justice in assuming that the terms represent three essential phases of our thanatology. Grace is a condition of allowance. The human energy can depend upon it. It is a form of assurance of immortality, with various restrictions and rules. Grace requires an imaginative effort; we must believe in "miracles as things." Its effect is to aid us in distributing our native energies; they need not be expended entirely upon current demands, but can be allo cated and "deposited," arranged and postponed. In the ex pectation or hope of grace, we do evil on an installment basis ; we are always aware of the necessary compensatory forms of remorse and penance. If we believe in grace, we also believe in immortality; in short, we believe. Such a circumstance has a remarkable influence upon our power of metaphor. We ex pend as much of it upon our vision of the postmortem world as upon the description of the world as a way to death. This does not mean that the world is slighted ; on the contrary, the assurance of immortality often makes sin more vividly possi ble ; we sin not from despair but in the expectation of a saving grace. It also affects the quality of sin, and in any event makes both the commission of it and the atonement for it more specifically and concretely and vividly active in the range of self-judgment and self-criticism. I do not suppose that there was ever a time in twentieth century life when expectations of an eternal life, with proper and discernible sanctions of conduct, were universally or even widely held. It is a matter of degrees of credibility, forms of imaginative effect, phases of partial or almost total suspen sion of such assurances. Most writers who have concerned themselves with the presence of grace have done so in meta phoric terms. Some have put the time of grace in the past, have borrowed the most vividly effective metaphors of grace</page><page sequence="4">442 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW from history and tradition. Others have conceived of grace as an almost purely personal issue: the search for a means of defining the reality of man's life demands a scope of metaphor that exists not as the sign of belief but as the area of imagina tive speculation concerning mortality. The secularization of man's self-judgment has had an im portant effect upon his view of grace. Grace is sometimes seen as health, physical or social. That is, it is what we de serve if we are "scientifically" or "verifiably" good. In this sense, personal immortality is dissolved into a social immor tality. A state is progressively strengthened; evil is gradu ally purified out of it; and I as citizen, in working toward that future condition of bliss (not for myself but for my children's children), share posthumously in it. This concept of grace depends upon an almost absolute faith in futures. Only future time is important in this case ; the past is valuable only in showing what we ought to avoid in the present to make the future pure. An exact and exacting discipline of known procedures and sound hypotheses is here mixed with an almost blind faith in the linear progress toward a condi tion infinitely better than the present. Disillusion comes hard in a matter such as this and is likely to lead to a change from secular to religious values out of desperation. It is possible of course to see immortality as a purely secu lar abstraction. The most materialistic of social systems often has the most purely dedicated martyrs. This kind of immor tality, expected not on the other side but on this side of death, is a common enough phenomenon in a time when "the other side" is hard to realize, to imagine, or to see. It involves the most rigidly doctrinaire and rational discipline as well as the most thoroughly sentimental, even irrational, trust in futures. All of life is in this case governed by a secular monasticism. Life is first preparation, then action, then sacrifice. Death is a proper conclusion, not a beginning at all. It is a sacrifice paid to the future. All men are Christs, suffering so that an idea of what society should be will be actualized.</page><page sequence="5">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 443 There are superficial resemblances between secular grace and spiritual grace: the ways in which each acts to provide sanctions and directions for behavior on this earth, the idea (rather hesitantly entertained, it is true) of a postmortem state of blessedness (for secular grace, it is "postmortem" in the sense of existing in a future beyond the deaths of those who are working for it), the sense of dedication, commitment, surrender of self. The basic difference lies in the extraordi nary value put upon history in secular grace, the absence of that value in spiritual grace. Eliot can dramatize the situa tion of Thomas à Becket (in "Murder in the Cathedral") al most as though neither he nor the situation had ever existed in history. Indeed, any historically grounded temptation of fered Thomas is scornfully turned aside; only spiritual temp tations affect him. In the best of modern literature devoted to problems of secular grace the reverse is true. Rubashov's major concern (in Koestler's "Darkness at Noon") is with history; all of his acts, selfish or self-sacrificial, are referred to history, and the question that haunts him to his death is that of the two forms of historical relevance, the humanitarian concern over persons living in the present (that is, are people living now a part of history or do they merely antedate it?) as against the impersonal view of history that puts ends en tirely in the future and thus abstracts them. Thus definitions of secular grace are constantly being modified in particulars but strengthened and hardened in generalities. Grace may also be seen as the essence of a culture. This is another form of abstraction. At one extreme it is a kind of exalted tourisme. Americans are especially vulnerable; sensing that there is something "spiritual" lacking in sky scrapers, they search for it in cathedrals. The literature of the First World War (or a part of it) had many examples of this kind of grace. Here it was the architecture, the gar dens, the visible forms of a cultural state that inspired. Young men from Nebraska died for "good taste" in France. It is not so easy to speculate upon the terms of immortality</page><page sequence="6">444 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW in these cases, but I believe that grace does successfully in fluence the relationship of life-death-immortality here as well. The cathedral and the abbey are symbols of tradition, forms of immortality; when they are destroyed, man is reduced to despair. The culture is linked to goodness, to virtue, to a spiritual world that was otherwise not clearly seen. The young men who died so that culture might survive did not expect an eternity of abbeys and string quartets. Their ex pectations were otherwise grounded ; but they were vaguely associated with the classics, and with France. God was dimly seen as a man of taste; it was only proper that men should fight to preserve His best expressions of it. Let me try to suggest some of the meanings of grace in modern literature. It is first of all influential even in ex tremely naturalistic cases as a spiritual residue. Even blas phemy and profanity testify to its persistence. Some of the most extreme forms of what appear to be "non-Christian" literature give evidence of its endurance. They are black masses which follow the form of the ritual for apparently perverse aims. Secondly, the presence of grace testifies to a continuity of tradition. Grace is usually held, in modern liter ature, to be a condition of the past. We are reminded of the past when we think of immortality. Several ambiguities ap pear, and they may well provide one of the clues to the mean ing of modern literature. Secular conversions have often many of the characteristics of religious conversions. The case of Joaquin on El Sordo's hill is pertinent (Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls") ; his conversion to the Commu nist ideal had been so thoroughly along Christian lines that in the end it changed over into a Christian faith. Often mod ern literature follows the forms of conventional illusions of immortality while at the same time it appears to be re nouncing them. The true occasions of grace in modern litera ture, however, are linked to the image of a past that is as much unlike the present as possible. More specifically, immortality has a profound effect upon</page><page sequence="7">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 445 the description of death scenes, of dying. Consider, in any number of cases, the scene and what it involves. While death is linked to life as its cause (since living is a succession of de vices for bringing life to a close), it is also linked to a post mortem future. The dying man is at the edge of learning the secret of that future. His body, corrupt, is to be given up, his soul to be transported into space, which at the beginning is limited but ends by being infinite. One thinks of the death bed scene of Father Lucero in Willa Cather's "Death Comes for the Archbishop" : "Among the watchers there was always hope that the dying man might reveal something of what he alone could see; that his countenance, if not his lips, would speak, and on his features would fall some light or shadow from beyond." Most important, death is a means of purification. No im mortality has been conceived which perpetuates the impurities of the body. There are stages along the way, which may be compared with the religious experience of a devout worshiper. The most vivid of these experiences is the expansion of space —pure space, uninhabited, undefiled. The soul "enters into" space, no matter how constricted the actual scene of the dying may be. This is what gives much discussion of "the spirit" a sense of spaciousness. The mystic talks not only of the loss of material consciousness, but also of the great expansion of space, of air, of light. Immortality begins, then, by gaining space and light at the expense of life. There is also the an thropomorphic sense of the absorption of an inferior by a superior being. Death is thought of as a rebirth into another life, quite unlike this life but with certain metaphoric associa tions with it. It is also considered a "wedding" of the spirit with God. These metaphors are essentially nonspiritual in their origin, linked to the anthropomorphic aspects of belief. Of special relevance to questions of the atmosphere of death are the spatial figurations in E. M. Forster's novel, "Howards End." Howards End itself, presided over by Ruth Wilcox and after her death by the Schlegel sisters, is spatially</page><page sequence="8">446 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW related to immortality and its requisite acknowledgment of death in the human economy. As a country house not too far separated from the rapidly growing city, it is constantly threatened by roads, motors, industrial developments ; dust, smog, smoke similarly threaten the horizon. But it is there, where one has a feeling of space, that the soul is nourished and prepared for its entrance into death. The recognition of death will save man, as against his horrifyingly naïve and urgent effort to deny it. To these speculations about death much of the literary view of mortality is indebted. The basic ambiguity of the death scene lies in the struggle to the end with the devil ; for death is not only a way to eternity, it is also an entrance to the place of judgment. The devil is associated throughout with the senses, with the pleasures and dissipations of the body. The dying man must therefore be purified ; hence the predominating representations of whiteness, of spaciousness, of purity, of emptiness. This is a state devoutly to be desired, but it is also one much feared; and it casts a pall upon those who must calculate all offenses in terms of relative and abso lute purification. Basically modern literature, in treating of the phenomena of death, contrasts the images of space and congestion (uncongested space is pure, crowded space is foul). Slum death occurs with every reminder of the constric tions of the grave. The grave is a crowded place, and uncom fortable, as are a jail cell, a flophouse room, a hospital ward, a trench, a city street. None of these places is a proper one for communing with God. Many of the modern images which specify the loss of belief in immortality emphasize this kind of space-congestion : furnished rooms, gutters, passageways, subways, et cetera. They are forms of a hell on earth, a ter restrial hell. Contrarily, immortality (which must save per sons from these congested areas) is thought of in terms of the most expansive spatial senses: ocean, sky, church (where the spatial sense moves upward, unifying ritual object with in finity), desert spaces, "wide open spaces," or "God's coun try."</page><page sequence="9">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 447 These images are much more conventional than those which describe the Hell of disbelief. There is a strong line from Whitman through modern poetry describing both death and immortality in terms of the sea (for example, Hart Crane's "Voyages," Marianne Moore's "A Grave," Eliot's "Dry Salvages"). As for desert spaces, one need only observe the very effective imagery of retreat into death and immortality in Miss Cather's "The Professor's House," or contrast many of the love scenes of D. H. Lawrence's "The Rainbow" and "Women in Love" with his portrayal of the soul's mise en scène in "St. Mawr." Perhaps the most elaborate use of the sea symbol is found in Mann's "Death in Venice." Premoni tions of death begin with the cemetery as setting; Venice and the sea are at the beginning of Aschenbach's decline (before he knows of it) framed neatly, though even then there are omens of disaster ; as he falls in love with Tadzio, the sea acts as background of the "perfect form" of his beloved; eventually we see the terrifying conflict between Aschenbach's notion of "perfect form," which in itself is empty, and the chaos de scribed both in the sea and in the plague-infested streets of Venice. The significance of grace depends upon the predictability of the relationship between the dying man and his expecta tion of immortality. He must know in advance that he will die, that death while inevitable is also an event for which he has the privilege of preparing. If he dies suddenly, the nature of the assailant as well as his complicity in the pattern of events leading to his death must be comprehensible. The am biguities of dying should be reduced to personal complexities ; he must understand them well enough to accept them. In short, he must be in command of both the space and the time in which his life reaches its conclusion. Ill Violent death does not in itself need to involve the destruc tion of a belief in immortality. It is not really so much a ques</page><page sequence="10">448 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW tion of violence as it is one of the passion of commitment. If the violence of one's death (either as actor or as victim) bears a discernible relationship to passion—that is, if the circum stance of death is consistent with the energy of one's earning it—then the balance of life, death, and immortality may still be maintained. Most concrete visions of hell have some fairly intelligible design of punishment according to the quality and intensity of the deaths that have preceded it. One enter tains a metaphor of punishment or purgation consistent with the nature of sin. There are two kinds of violence, however, in which this balance is not achieved: violence in excess of expectation ("sentimental violence") and impersonal violence. A remark able portrayal of "sentimental violence" is found in the be havior of Robert Cohn, in Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises"; Cohn's skill as a boxer propels him into violence against his friends for "romantic" purposes. His romanticism (a naïve failure to read human situations correctly, a literal earnestness concerning literary clichés) is powered by his skill, which had originally been acquired for unrealistic pur poses. These subtleties are entirely missed in the recent film version of the novel. One may say that any violence is com prehensible if it is inflicted upon another by personal means within view of the victim, or at least within the range of the victim's expectation. Any violence which goes beyond these limits is not comprehensible, and it upsets the calculus of un derstanding in the matter of dying. One needs to know from what and from whom one is dying, or he will not be able to cast up his accounts. The obvious next step leads us to a con sideration of the "mechanics" of death. The history of death moves from the circumstances of calculated risk or predict able consequence to the condition of the impersonal, unrea sonable, unreal, and unseen assailant. All moral and religious systems depend upon at least a core of reality and predication in these matters. One must at least imaginatively, if he can not literally, accept the circumstances of his death. Kafka's</page><page sequence="11">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 449 earnest heroes suffer from a failure of imagination, or at least they are designed to warn us of the dangers of a too literal expectation from reality. The history of our culture is quite adequately clear in these matters. When once physical law describes the limits of our world, our literature begins to work within these limits, to borrow the broad, vague metaphors of fate and destiny, to invoke images of vast natural forces which overwhelm man. Naturalism so directs man away from the moral, confes sional, and willed levels of his life that events must take place in a world and in a way that cannot be understood. As a re sult, naturalist literature fumbles over the question of moti vation, because motivation is no longer clear if "forces" dic tate beyond the power of man to accept and adjust. One of the simplest examples is that of Clyde Griffiths in Dreiser's novel, "An American Tragedy" ; his failure of decision, while Dreiser tortures his text in an effort to explain it, is a form of motiveless violence; he allows a crime to happen (as dis tinguished from Raskolnikov of Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment," who forces it to happen), and the crime is therefore a consequence of criminal indecision. Naturalist violence of this kind is very close to being impersonal, and one may draw an interesting parallel with other forms of im personal violence in our literature. Impersonal violence upsets all of the equilibrium notice able otherwise in the relationship of life, death, and immor tality. There is neither a cause nor a corpse. And since in the overwhelming majority of cases both are necessary to sustain a belief in immortality, most of the sanctions which support a faith in something beyond the self are entirely lacking. Our literature therefore treats of violence in terms of the psycho logical equivalents of the distance between assailant and vic tim. There is a direct relevance in the matter of passion ex pended, both to deal blows and to suffer them. The intellect cannot be substituted for the passion. In fact, most of the ambiguities associated with death in modern literature arise</page><page sequence="12">450 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW because the intellect has replaced the passion as an agent of death. Since the intellect is accessible to almost infinite ex pansion, the ratio between cause and corpse becomes more and more disproportionate. The credibility and acceptability of death are both dependent upon one's knowing, suspecting, sensing, or imagining the cause. If death comes as a "sur prise," it may still be understood as a consequence of one or another kind of inadequacy of body, mind, or spirit. Violent death, however, destroys all expectations, reasonable or im aginable. The history of violence in the twentieth century (and in its literature) follows somewhat along these lines, in terms of the character of the assailant: the assailant as human being, as instrument, as machine, as landscape. In this last case, the assailant is neither human nor mechanical but the entire en vironment, the land itself, or the world or the solar system: whatever extent of space the instrument of the assailant has put at his disposal. Many of the literary expressions of this circumstance have been given in terms of vast landscapes of desert, or ice-bound images of terror, or mountain perspec tives. These have the double function of separating man from time and eliminating most associations with ordinary reality. The strategy of adjustment to this kind of violence usually takes the form of making the generalizations defending it as vast, unreal, unavailable to rational explanation as the cir cumstance itself. The natural reaction to them is to trust nothing that is vague, abstract, not associated with immedi ate experience. Most of the poetry written about the Second World War considers the landscape of violence that is the metaphor of that war as a space suspended between the past the soldier has left and the future to which he hopes to return. The past and the future are identical and together they are antitheti cally opposed to the present. A soldier is given a number; he is asked to be anonymous—that is, he is asked to give his passion to the army so that it may be regulated according to</page><page sequence="13">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 451 the strategies of its military needs. Having lost or tempo rarily suspended his identity, he exists in a state of unreality, of anonymity, which constitute the circumstance of his death, should he meet it there. This means that he must risk the chance of death without identity. He is an "unknown soldier" in a vividly statistical sense. The shock of dislocation is much more vivid in the literature of the First World War than it is in that of the Second. This is because the violence had little or no precedent and it was therefore not expected. Both the occasion and the shock of it were a violent separation from the reality to which the soldier was accustomed. Further, the occasion of violence on a vast scale had the double result of destroying precedent and setting up circumstances of violent tension. Much of our literature is a literature of tension caused either by unexpected violence or by the expectation of violence that does not occur. IV We are left with self. The basic mode of adjustment to the phenomena of modern dying is that of self. The self, con sidered as identifiable entity (it has a name, a sex, a set of qualities identifying it) had once existed in "partnership" either with God or with a philosophy that denied or accom modated Him. It is this association that Unamuno, for ex ample, insists upon, against all dissuasions of reason and logic ("The Tragic Sense of Life"). The history of Kierke gaardian existentialism and of the literature that recalls it is abundantly supplied with issues involving the self and God, belief and acceptance in the face of overwhelmingly discour aging evidence. The shock of violence unaccounted for, un seen, unreal, and unreasonable, meant that the self was sepa rated from most doctrines of sufficient reason; it had to make its "separate peace." Since the self cannot be sustained with out some viable code or some illusion, there were many con trived readjustments. The history of religious and emotional "fads" in the years between the wars is well known. The</page><page sequence="14">452 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW search for a sustaining illusion also led into the byways of mythopoeie research and availed itself of archetypal re sources. The modern self tries also to reread the past in terms of its present situation. This is unusual only in the intensity with which it is done. Revivals in literature conspicuously emphasize the heroic struggle with evil, or seize upon drama tizations of force in the near or remote past, or try to reaffirm old religious orthodoxies by combining them with resources in mysticism. It is not so much that the self needs a God, but that it cannot or does not wish to stand alone. It is a comfort to know that patterns of behavior, actual or imagined, are repe titions, shared archetypically with the entire history of the race, are actually a part of a "collective unconscious," to which each self may attend if the need occurs. This is not to defeat death but to gain a kind of immortality in the sharing of undying patterns. The rôle of the self in modem literature has undergone one of the most thorough histories an age might contrive. It begins with the "pure, practical" consciousness of William James, developed in a time when self-awareness was some thing little more than a pleasant game. It begins also in Berg son's l'élan vital, available as it was to only the most exquisite of metaphysical scruples. The pre-eminence of self, or of sen sitive self-awareness, could not long endure without its own scorching ironies. Shortly after the beginning of the twentieth century the ironic modes of Laforgue, Corbière, occasionally of Rimbaud became popular and seemed necessary. Some such form of ironic contemplation is evident in at least one phase of the work of most modern "giants": Eliot, Pound, Joyce, Gide, even the very early Faulkner. In any case, the self is separated from the "herd," the "mass," the "mostarian" by some contrivance or other, or by virtue of a powerful "non serviam" gesture, or a "separate peace" which requires re definition of the terms of an enduring armistice. In the 1930's, when the self was not absorbed by the state, it became</page><page sequence="15">GRACE, VIOLENCE, AND SELF 453 an isolated intelligence looking as hopelessly upon the waste land as ever did Eliot's Tiresias, though here with even less prospect of salvation because associated with no system what soever of therapeutic values. Religious exertions on behalf of the self are conspicuous in this and in the following decade. Eliot's is perhaps most notable, but one must also note the Christian fable of William Faulkner, which makes the tor tuous path described for his early heroes seem like a secular ized Ash Wednesday. The Catholic assertion in modern literature, independently avowed in the psychological circumstance of conversion, is also of great importance. This is like a re-examination of the Catholic orthodoxy done over entirely from the perspective of an ego formed from quite different sources. In Robert Lowell, for example, the Calvinist condemns, the Catholic saves; both are indispensable, the Catholic only more so. Many of the Catholic views of the self, while they stay within the knowledge of the Catholic judgment of evil, make dra matic substance of the very real conflict between doctrine and human fallibility. Graham Greene again and again takes his characters on the most complex and tortured of journeys to an end which can be called neither salvation nor damnation but appears an intolerable mixture of both. The most important and in many ways the most "realistic" adjustment of the self in recent years is the existentialist. It is more persuasive because it does not require an appeal to religious forms to explain the self and because it begins with the naked fact of an isolated self. In these terms, the problem of the "absurd," which is after all what the violence of our century has given us, can be and must be considered. It is re lated to the defeat of rationalist expectations, begins with the acceptance of such a defeat. In these circumstances, the entire growth of the sensibility is seen with death as a termi nus. At least for the purpose of present realization, there is nothing beyond death. It is important that there be nothing, because self-awareness ought not to be mitigated by promises</page><page sequence="16">454 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW or prior soothing knowledges. The terror of immediate self realization is an experience of deatb-in-life which, at least in some of its manifestations, is consonant with the century's violent history. In terms of it Sartre, at least, has developed a cosmogony, an eschatology, an earth and a hell, solely along lines of the immediate issues of existence in space and endur ance in time that emerge from the abandonment of immor tality. One endures, not because man is good and "will pre vail," but because he exists, because he will die some time and meanwhile must live. What I have given here is only a small portion of the speculation necessary in any exact and thorough study of death and modern literature. My principal objective has been to show that each of the three major terms—grace, vio lence, and self—has a determining influence upon the ways in which death as event is invested with image and metaphor, and that the pattern of life-death-immortality is distinct in each case. We have in the first of these cases a clearly seen development of the human consciousness; the images of death are borrowed from those of life, and there is a close relation ship between primary and secondary qualities (between ab stractions and sensuous detail). In the second case, the ordi nary expectation of immortality is violated, and the balance of assailant and victim, of cause and corpse, is upset. As a result death ranges from statistical loss to complete annihila tion, but in any event the calculus of proper and responsible judgment of death as a predictable result of understandable causes no longer obtains. Finally, the various mutations of the self in the twentieth century lead us perhaps to the pres ent and to the pinpoint of existence as an irreducible starting point. This is a reconstructive beginning, perhaps; it is pre figured in a number of ways in twentieth-century literature. In any case, self defined by existence as prior law is a per vasive and often an obsessive notion underlying much modern literature.</page></plain_text>
