<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN: A FIFTEEN YEAR RETROSPECTIVE By P. R. S. Moorey Fifteen years ago I attempted a preliminary study of the historical development of metalworking in western Iran, with special reference to Luristan. This inevitably involved commentary on the wider aspects of the subject, but did not include any critical analysis of the broader spectrum of information even then available. In the ensuing period, apart from a considerable increase in research in Iran, two developments in particular outside Iranian studies have modified the perspectives in which the early metallurgy of Iran may now be set. There has been an enormous, worldwide increase in the serious study of archaeometallurgy, both in the field and in the laboratory. With this has come not only a massive expansion of the world data-base for explanations of the course and character of early metallurgy, but also a growing disenchantment with existing, and rather rigid, explanatory models for metallurgical development that take little or no account of the particular socio-economic systems involved.' This is all part of a general change of emphasis in archaeological research in the same period, during which a pre-occupation with questions of chronology and distribution have been steadily matched by inquiry into the processes which gave rise to technological (and all other) innovations and the factors within a given society sympathetic to their reception. The evolution of pre-Achaemenid metalworking in Iran is not only interesting in its own right, as all stages of metal exploitation are locally represented and the craft repertory was both inventive and diverse, but of considerable significance for any study of the cultural and social development of ancient Iran. Metals were amongst the most important of the minerals exploited there in antiquity, for local as for foreign consumption; but their role in long-distance commodity exchanges and cultural interaction, to which attention has increasingly turned, has yet to be brought into full focus. Attention has largely concentrated on the exploitation of stones, which lend themselves more easily at present to source and distribution analysis.2 Even if such ai. undertaking were not far beyond the scope and intention of this paper, it would anyway still be very circumscribed by restricted evidence for the primary stages of metal extraction and by the absence of reliable, comprehensive laboratory studies of ores from known mines and artefacts from controlled excavations. The following bird's eye-view of a complex body of data, very uneven in range and quality, seeks only to provide some simple, and provisional, framework for discussion at a time when fieldwork is generally suspended and overall assessments of the current level of knowledge in any particular branch of Iranian archaeology seem particularly appropriate. When a country remains as relatively unknown archaeologically as does Iran, even after twenty years of intensive research, for which publication is still minimal, single excavated sites and single groups of particularly distinctive artefacts inevitably tend to become focal points to the exclusion of others not so newly-discovered or not so well represented in the surviving material record. A broadly-ranging view will lack detail, but it may hope to compensate for that by helping to provide a realistic sense of proportion and perspective. A. SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIES 1. Mines and Mining Iran is not only rich in metals, but they are also widely distributed, providing potential for the development of a number of self-supporting regional production centres. Simple copperworking, for example, might have been sustained in all the main areas of Iran, where settlement is evident in the Neolithic, on the basis of a trickle trade from a source area. Only with the discovery of smelting is it likely that growing demand for copper encouraged more intensified settlement in the agricultural zones closest to mining areas and the elaboration of regional exchange networks, which may already have existed in some form for the distribution of shells and semi-precious stones. It is probable that 81</page><page sequence="2">82 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES long-distance trade in native copper had existed for some time before this happened, but that it did not involve any independent exchange mechanism. It is not until the fourth millennium B.c. that there is evidence for a long-distance exchange in which lowland urban centres were brought into direct contact with those who controlled the primary copper producing areas in Iran. Copper sources for particular settlements are still very largely a matter of conjecture, rather than of demonstration, despite a marked increase of systematic research into potential mining areas in the last twenty years. The primary result of this work has been improved maps of the possible source areas exploited in antiquity, particularly for copper.3 It is concentrated into five main regions: northern Azerbaijan; Anarak; Abbasabad; Kerman; and Tarum, with extension into Taleghan and Karaj. The literature already contains information on a number of field projects and laboratory programmes designed to elucidate further the sources of the copper exploited in prehistoric Iran, but in every case publication of results has so far been rare and highly selective.4 Attention has concentrated predominantly on the Anarak-Talmessi area, which has long been taken as the crucial zone of supply for native copper and the arsenical coppers used in the early phases of the Iranian metal industries. But in view of the scattered distribution of early settlement across the country, and the relatively close correlation of some of this settlement with known copper source zones, it has still to be demonstrated that this was indeed the only major region of exploitation and supply before historic times, when a much broader pattern is evident.' With the laboratory methods available at present it is likely that some sound conclusions are possible for provenience studies of native copper and copper smelted from simple oxide and carbonate ores. But once industries had developed to the point (perhaps already by the fourth millennium B.c. in parts of Iran) when a variety of ores were being used under different conditions, with or without fluxes, alloys were commonplace, and the recycling of copperwork was normal practice, provenience studies depending on elemental analysis are as likely to confuse as they are to clarify the relationships of source areas and distant production centres. The most satisfactory description of an ancien - mine in Iran has been provided by research in the Veshnoveh area, between Qom and Kashan in west-central Iran.6 Here a series of low, narrow tunnels were traced following the natural configurations of the ore veins, with indications of mining by fire- setting and subsequent hammering with stone mauls. The copper occurs in the form of malachite, with some azurite and chalcocite, and specks of native copper. The earliest pottery found there was an isolated vessel of Sialk IV type. The assembled evidence indicates methods of mining closely akin to those more fully investigated at the Eneolithic mine of Rudna Glava in Yugoslavia, where methods derive directly from those of flint mining. Here Javanovic reported: "After excavation of access platforms, shafts were dug and the ore extracted by the technique of alternate heating and cooling. Subsequently, the ore was broken by bone and wooden wedges and ground by massive hammer pebbles and lifted out of the shafts."7 Everywhere research into prehistoric mining is complicated by the tendency of subsequent mining to remove all but the merest traces of earlier work, so that in this field of research, particularly, comparative studies are indispensable.8 For sources of gold, silver and lead, and their primary treatment, no direct evidence is available from prehistoric contexts. All current statements are again assumptions, depending to a greater or lesser extent on information assembled by scholars working in later periods, when some degree of documentary assistance is available for comparison with the results of modern field surveys.9 Tin remains a notorious enigma. It is not mined anywhere in Iran today, and the case for its availability there in antiquity rests partly on deductions from Mesopotamian texts of the second millennium B.c., indicating its passage from the eastern highlands westwards through Mesopotamia into the Levant, and partly on the survival of a remarkable quantity of good quality tin-bronzes in graves of the Iranian Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. In current discussions, two regions appear most often as potential sources: the central Lut, for which there is some minimal evidence, and a west or northwest Iranian source, for which there is still no hard evidence. Sources further to the east, but short of Thailand, are not much more certain. o Iron is considered below in its historical context. 2. Smelting The historical aspects of this technique are best taken in their appropriate place in the following</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 83 discussion (see p. 4). The pioneer excavators rarely noted the surface debris on those parts of a mound which they did not excavate. For instance, Ghirshman does not mention slag at Tepe Sialk, but Tylecote subsequently reported it in profusion over the south mound, providing clear evidence for local copper smelting. There was none on the north mound, but some in the area of Cemetery "B".11 Similar surface indications have been reported by recent research at Tepe Hissar, where sufficient information was gathered for the reconstruction of various stages in the reduction process,12 and from Shahr-i Sokhta and other sites in Seistan.'3 In all such cases, detailed stratigraphical controls (part of the renewed research at Tepe Hissar) are as vital as is the proper laboratory examination of the material retrieved. Doubts now surround the initial claims made for the nature of metallurgical activity at an early date at Tall-i Iblis, near Kerman, where "Iblis II" yielded hundreds of broken crucible fragments, but a relative sparsity of slag and a lack of furnace debris. The reported copper dross, the charcoal and the oval, flat-bottomed crucibles may result from melting rather than smelting activities.'4 There is certainly little reason to give Iblis any special place in Iranian metal production in the fifth millennium B.c. on the present evidence. Though certain sites may have specialized in the craft production of copper, as some did in other raw materials, the larger settlements with access to a variety of mineral resources are likely to have had a more complex range of craft specializations related to interlocking networks of regional exchange as in historic times. The nature of smelting operations close to mines, which is the pattern elsewhere in the Near East where evidence is available," have still to be described for Iran. It is clear at Tepe Ghabristan (see below) that selected ore fragments were transported from mines to settlements from an early period; but extensive smelting operations are very unlikely to have taken place within settlements. 3. Workshops Two sites, one of the fifth millennium B.C. (Late Sialk III), the other of the third, now offer some secure evidence for the character of copper vTorkshops within settlements. A copper smith's establishment was excavated at Tepe Ghabristan, 60 km south of Qazvin.'6 Within the workshop were benches and hearths, and 20 kilos of copper ore (primarily malachite) broken down into hundreds of nut-sized pieces for local smelting. A crucible, with a base slot to facilitate handling when hot, amply defined the area's function. Open moulds of baked clay from the same vicinity were for bar ingots and with them were other moulds which may have been for casting shaft-hole hammers or picks and adze- axes. There was also part of a clay tuydre.'7 In what may be a slightly later context at Seh Gabi in Kurdistan, Levine reported that "while copper objects were rare, the recovery of a number of crucible fragments, some with copper still adhering, as well as several possible ingot moulds, indicates that metal working was carried out at Seh Gabi during Godin VII times".'8 The workshop area at Khabis (Shahdad), near Kerman, lay some distance north-east of the better known graveyards. It contained a variety of metal-working installations, including furnaces, with associated pieces of copper ore, iron ore for use as a fluxing agent, slag and baked clay moulds. No detailed report of this important installation has yet been published.19 Other evidence for the working of metals, like the stone moulds from Susa,20 and the open and closed moulds from Hasanlu,21 have no controlled archaeological context, so they yield no direct information on the workshops whence they came. B. THE REPERTORY OF OBJECTS AND TECHNIQUES 1. The Pioneer or Plateau Traditions The earliest metal finds relevant to this survey are no more than isolated indicators. From the ninth millennium B.c. there is a small pierced oval pendant, whether of native copper or of malachite is not established, from the Shanidar Cave in the Zagios.22 It is a metal stone worked as if it were a nonmetallic stone, purely for decorative or prestige value. Man's earliest exploitation of metal ores is part of the history of stone-working, for which first of all selective surface collecting and then quarrying, hammering and polishing, flaking and drilling, and in certain circumstances heat treatment, had been used millennia before there is the least evidence for the melting of metals.23 The nuclear regions for such a development lay where metallic stones, notably copper in its various forms,</page><page sequence="4">84 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES distinguished by colour and to a lesser extent by shape, were associated with stones long sought and used for toolkits and ornaments. Although the search for pigments may have been instrumental in familiarizing ancient man with the appearance of the main iron ores, in the case of copper and lead ores there seems to have been no such obvious relationship.24 Two millennia after the Shanidar pendant may be placed a single globular bead of native copper, cold-hammered, cut with a chisel, and rolled into shape, from Ali Kosh in Khuzistan.25 This lowland site is hundreds of miles from any known source of native copper. Whether the copper or the ready- made bead came from highland Iran or from eastern Anatolia, through an established obsidian exchange system, are entirely open questions.26 It is only from sometime in the first half of the sixth millennium B.c. that it becomes possible to describe a repertory of primitive metalwork. A particular problem at this stage, already alluded to, is the crucial distinction between artefacts of melted native copper and those of melted smelted copper: a distinction which cannot be made confidently from any laboratory examination technique known at present. But in Iran, so few of the well-contexted early metal finds have been examined in laboratories that our knowledge would not be much greater at this stage even if the difference had been reliably established. Only restricted research has been done on where precisely native copper was available in the Near East in antiquity: but its presence in highland Iran is certain, and there is no reason to doubt the common assumption that the first stage in local metallurgy involved the gathering of native copper from the surface and its manipulation, first by cold-working, then by annealing. Beyond that, no generalizations may yet be safely made when in Iran it is possible that alloys of native copper and copper arsenides were produced as early, if not earlier, than the regular production of copper smelted from its oxide ores.27 From an early date, melting native copper, alloying and smelting copper went together. The discovery of smelting should probably not be regarded as an abrupt event. Charles,28 for one, has pointed out that the firing of green malachite in a charcoal fire easily produces sponge copper, which agglomerates or melts if the tempi -rature is high enough. The natural association of iron oxides with copper deposits, as in parts of Iran, may account for the discovery of the use of a flux to melt mineral gangue and facilitate the separation of copper. The realization that copper might be extracted from its ores by smelting dramatically increased the potential supplies of metallic copper. It is likely that experience with pottery firing, though the technologies differ, stimulated the developments in pyrotechnology most suited to smelting." In Iran from the late seventh millennium B.c. there was a varied pattern of efficient kiln construction at a number of settlements,30 revealing that in so far as temperature controls and a reducing atmosphere are concerned there is no reason for rejecting the argument that smelted copper may have appeared early in areas where native copper and oxide ores are both available. The role of lead in the primary stages of Iranian metallurgy is still obscure, though it appears early in Anatolia and Mesopotamia."3 As elsewhere in the Near East, evidence before the fourth millennium B.c. for the exploitation of gold-an accessible native metal, easily worked-and silver-a much more complex matter-is still absent. It is unlikely to be coincidence that the settlement sites with the earliest evidence for metalworking concentrate on the plateau, where the metals would have been most accessible. However, not enough field survey has yet been done to interrelate source exploitation and settlement spread in particular areas. A small group of very primitive awls, said to be of hammered native copper, were recovered from level II at Tepe Zagheh in the Qazvin Plain, with one or two similar tools mounted in bone handles. These represent very well that fundamental stage in the working of copper when it offered a finer, if softer, working point than might easily be achieved and maintained in stone. On the principle that, without direct evidence to the contrary, the nearest source is the most probable, the exacavator has located this in the broad area of Tarum in the Elburz mountains.32 From Sialk 1.3 come the first copper artefacts recognized at this key site, perhaps as likely to have been using metal from the Veshnoveh area, 45 kilometres to the north, as from the more distant Anarak region to which it is commonly linked. Pins, projectile points, awls and spiral coils, already rather more than a "trinket technology", are the standard repertory at this stage.33 Tests on a pinhead showed it to be of very pure copper;34 a pin from Sialk I or II, examined by Cyril Smith, was of cold-worked native copper.35 By</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 85 Sialk II, into the fifth millennium B.C., there is evidence at least, of annealing and the range and quality of the surviving metalwork is greater;36 spearhead shapes had developed markedly and personal ornaments were more varied. Some fragments from levels of this period were said to be Chalcopyrite.37 To the Sialk I-II horizon belongs the site of Tall-i Mushki in Fars (Marv Dasht), which yielded a comparable range of pins, a bead, a fish-hook and an ornament,38 which the excavators believed to be of hammered native copper. A single faience bead was also found here. The Japanese excavators, realizing the potential significance of such a find at this early date, were cautious about its archaeological context. But there is no obvious indication that it was intrusive.39 If it is in this context, then it illustrates the already complex development of applied chemistry and pyrotechnology in parts of Iran at this time. At the very least, it draws attention to the need to watch carefully for all traces of precocious faience production in Iran. There is evidence for the presence of glazed steatite and faience for small objects in North Mesopotamia by at least the CUbaid period in the fifth millennium B.C. Two awls, of the second half of the fifth millennium B.c., were found at Tepe Yahya; one was shown to be native copper.40 In Sialk 111.1.3, needles, either with pierced or folded heads, "pins", some with both ends swollen, and awls continue in the established craft tradition. In 111.2 the first tanged dagger blade appears, but whether it was cast or hammered is not known. Such simple, open-mould castings, whether of melted native copper or of smelted copper, are very likely in view of the marked advances evident in artefacts from Sialk 111.4-5. In Sialk III.4, long copper pins with conical heads and a cast shafthole hoe or adze mark a basic stage in the development of casting techniques.4' In Sialk 111.5 the metalsmith's repertory has finally moved to a broadly based range of needles and pins, chisels and flat axes, hammered and cast, and fine dagger blades with long tangs.42 The bivalve moulds, already noted, from Tepe Ghabristan indicate that improved techniques of casting were in use across much of the western plateau, though not always evident among the artefacts recovered by excavation. The repertory of tools at Ghabristan, Sialk and Hissar (IB-C) are closely parallel43 at a time when ceramic distribution and other factors indicate steadily increasing trans-Iranian contacts with the Mesopotamian lowlands. As Deshayes argued,44 present information indicates that metallurgy in Elam probably developed primarily from stimulus contact with the Iranian plateau, whence came its metals. Sumerian contacts came later with direct political involvement. Graves of Susa I (Le Breton : Susa A) contained many copper flat axes, large and small chisels, pins and mirrors; the Louvre has 55 flat axes in this time range.45 The published data from Susa is in marked contrast to the virtual absence of metal from graves of the later CUbaid period in southern Mesopotamia.46 Tepe Yahya, a site whose place on trans-Iranian trade and cultural interaction networks at this time is still obscure, has yielded some metalwork of the first half of the fourth millennium B.C., levels VC-A.47 Although it only illustrates a restricted repertory of pins and a flat axe-blade, their value to this survey is greatly increased by the analytical and metallographic study made of them. Tylecote48 identified arsenical coppers and remarked that a spatula, a chisel and an awl which he examined "have been made from smelted, cast, and forged copper or copper-base alloy, reheated and hot-worked. Some of the edges of the tools have been cold-worked to a considerable extent, probably resulting in a reduction of thickness of 50% or more. The maximum hardness achieved was at the edge of the chisel." An ingot was found in level VB (not analysed) and two fragments of complex sulphide ores, partially shaped by hammering. The inter-relation of technologies at this time is illustrated by a copper pin with a fi'it head from level VB.49 There is also some indication of a marked shift from bone to copper implements at Tepe Yahya in the same chronological horizon. This might indicate a change in local technology; but in the absence of clear evidence for local production, Beale preferred to take it as indicative of a "shift in trade mechanics so as to regularize the import of finished copper tools from a production site or sites in the rich copper areas to the north in sufficient quantities to supplant bone tools".50 It has long been argued, and there is no evidence to challenge the view, that metalworking at sites in north-east Iran and eastwards into Turkmenia derived from earlier workshop traditions on the plateau evolved closer to the source zones. The initial pattern of typological development and</page><page sequence="6">86 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES differentiation at Tepe Hissar on the eastern edge of the plateau, in the Sialk III horizon, is no different from that to the west: simple flat axe or adze-blades (IC), knife-blades (IC), pins (IB), awls and tacks of copper. No other metals were retrieved from this period by excavations."5 By Hissar II, in the later fourth millennium B.c., the copper repertory is much more adventurous, with the additional production of copper seals, daggers with midribs, shaft-hole mace-heads, spiral-headed pins, coiled bracelets, earrings and finger-rings. Silver and rare gold ornaments were now also in production and there is some evidence for the use of lead.52 To the east, on the frontiers with central Asia, metal tools and weapons had increased considerably in variety by this time. Analyses of such objects indicate production from smelted copper ore rather than from native metal, using a rather complicated annealing technique which increased hardness." At the opposite corner of Iran, in Khuzistan, where a complex society was rapidly emerging by the middle of the fourth millennium B.c. a major metallurgical advance is represented by the first appearance of material evidence for small lost-wax castings, at much the same time as they appear in Mesopotamia. A group of copper pins in levels 17-14 (Le Breton: Susa Cb) at Susa have their heads cast as animal or human figures.54 At the same time at Susa there is evidence for an increasingly sophisticated exploitation of gold and silver for jewellery and ornaments in general."55 One of the most outstanding metal objects yet known of this period has no archaeological context. It is stylistically so typical of "Proto-Elamite" art in Susiana that its cultural horizon is not in doubt, nor, thanks to careful laboratory examination, is its authenticity. This silver vessel, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, is made of sheet silver shaped to form a kneeling bull holding a spouted jar in its extended front legs.56 The silver is very pure and the whole object is skilfully assembled from separate pieces of sheetmetal joined with good quality hard silver solder. By the second half of the fourth millennium B.c. in Iran, gold, silver, lead and various types of copper were widely distributed across the country, from a number of source zones, in a refined or partially refined state. Many simple local industries existed for the production of basic tools, weapons and ornaments. Craft skills to work elaborate objects, notably in precious metals, were only to be found in a few major urban centres, as at Susa and Tepe Hissar, on which exchange networks focused and where mortuary gifts already suggest a marked degree of social stratification. Elam, for instance, exercised at this time some effective, if only yet sporadically documented, control far across Iran along the major supply routes. It redistributed raw materials, and perhaps some finished goods, into Sumer and beyond in a rapidly growing long-distance exchange system, which has been variously explained in the last fifteen years, usually with third rather than fourth millennium data in mind.57 It is only as the third millennium proceeds that it becomes possible to speak with more confidence of local metalworking traditions, in areas outside Elam, whose repertory of artefacts increasingly exhibits distinctive traits of form and decoration. By 3000 B.C., all the basic craft techniques were current for the known metals, as were the raw materials for local use and for export. It was socio-economic and ideological factors which now controlled the extent to which they were exploited from region to region, and dictated the remarkable quantity of copperwork which found its way into graves: the major source for our knowledge of Iranian metallurgy in antiquity. If any single thing demonstrates the availability of metal, and the vitality of the metal crafts in ancient Iran, it is this long-prevailing custom. For the moment, it is only at Tepe Yahya that there is any detailed metallographic and analytical information on metal objects covering the end of the fourth and through the third millennium B.c. (Levels IVC-A).58 The recovered repertory here, where no cemetery was discovered, is still a simple one, of pins, spatulae, rings, isolated shaft-hole axeheads, chisel and projectile points, predominantly of arsenical coppers, but with rare low-tin bronzes from the mid to later third millennium B.c. Twenty metal objects and production fragments were recovered from Level IVC (ca. 3200-2900 B.c.); about 65 metal objects firom IVB (ca. 2800-2400 B.c.), when there was the highest percentage of copper-arsenic alloyed objects; and 45 objects from IVA (ca. 2400-1800 B. c.), when there was decreased frequency of arsenical coppers. In discussing the arsenical copper objects Heskel and Lamberg-Karlovsky have laid considerable emphasis on the virtual absence of copper sulpharsenides in Iran, on present information, and what is believed to be the unique appearance of domeykite and algodonite (native</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 87 arsenides of copper of a greyish or tin-white metallic appearance) near the surface in the Anarak- Talmessi mining area included in copper bearing gossans. They take this to be the ultimate source of the metal used for the objects found at Tepe Yahya. If this important conclusion is sustained by future geological and metallurgical research (there are potential copper sources closer to Tepe Yahya not so fully investigated as the Anarak region), it may mean that the prehistoric copper industries of Iran over a long period of time were ultimately dependent on this one major source zone. In the absence of artefacts from cemeteries, where the range of forms and techniques is always much wider, it is very difficult to rank the evidence from Yahya alongside such sites as Susa, Shahdad, Sialk and Hissar in any attempt to gauge how typical its metallurgy is of the period in question. But here, as across the whole country, copper and arsenical coppers were the predominant metals for all general purposes until well into the second millennium a.c. How the arsenical coppers were manufactured is still a matter of debate, though it seems now to be generally agreed that arsenic was not recognized as a separate element in the Bronze Age. It probably involved the selective smelting of arsenical copper ores, particularly available with the increasing depth of mining below the surface, when smiths observed that certain ores yielded a metal less porous in castings and of improved hardness. 2. Growing Diversity: Craft Traditions of the Bronze Age (a) The Emergence of Tin-Copper Alloys: Before proceeding to a sketch of regional metalworking, it is simplest to isolate the prime question of the exploitation of tin as a general problem. The obscurity of its sources has already been commented on (p. 82). A general Near Eastern perspective is helpful here. Although the validity of the high absolute chronologies used by some Anatolian experts is open to question, the use of tin-copper alloys in Anatolia appears to be earlier than anywhere else in the Near East, and de Jesus has consequently argued in favour of local tin sources.59 In Early Bronze I they occur in the west at Troy and Thermi and in the east at Alishar. "Late tChalcolithic" bronzes from Mersin may, if the archaeological contexts are secure, be isolated cases, like similar precocious tin-copper alloys reported from Ghassul in Palestine and Tepe Gawra in Iraq.60 In Palestine there is still no clear evidence of bronze artefacts before the Early to Middle Bronze Age at the end of the third millennium B.c., and they are rare. The published analytical data for Syria offer no very clear indication of the situation there in the third millennium.6' In Mesopotamia the tin-copper alloys in the "Royal Tombs" at Ur, of the second quarter of the third millennium B.c., remain the earliest, though textual data may indicate the use of tin at Ur soon after 3000 B.c.62 In so far as a small number of analyses allow us to judge, Khuzistan and western Iran fall within this Mesopotamian bracket, although there, as everywhere else west of' the Zagros, the basic metal industry was long to remain a copper/arsenical copper one. For example, the mid-third millennium "Vase 'a la Cachette" from Susa contained only two artefacts of tin-bronze among many of copper.63 Selective use of tin at Susa in the production of weapons, at least in the Akkadian period, may be illustrated by the fact that six axe-heads of Deshayes Group A. la are arsenical coppers, whilst only one, significantly inscribed as if it were a presentation weapon, has 5.9% tin.64 Only uncontexted, typologically dated artefacts from Luristan have yet been analysed, but they do nothing to alter the conclusion that the significance of tin in the third millennium B.C. in the economy of the Near East is very easily overrated.65 Moving eastwards over the Zagros, a dearth of analyses, and the consequent danger of overemphasizing isolated ones, makes any conclusions hazardous. But largely unpublished new work on metal from Hissar66 and Shahdad67 does nothing to contradict the conclusion reached for Elam. In their 1937 report on the Hissar metalwork Riesch and Horton commented that: "From the amount of tin found in the analyses none of the objects can be termed true bronzes. The presence of the tin and lead came about, no doubt, from their association with the copper in the copper ore. There is no definite proportion of tin in the samples from any one level, and it is supposed that the variation may be due to the method of refining. The presence of as little as one or two per cent of tin gives the metal considerable stiffness, if we ignore the possibility of a probable hardening process having been used. The relative high purity of the copper can be attributed to the fact that probably fully oxidized outcrops of minerals such as malachite were used for the source of ore".68 The</page><page sequence="8">88 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES status of the Shahr-i Sokhta industry is difficult to establish from the data published so far, but does not seem to differ markedly.69 The Shahdad industry is of copper and arsenical copper.70 A dagger blade from Tepe Yahya IVB, from some time in the middle of the third millennium B.C., when analysed by Tylecote turned out to be "one of the many arsenical low-tin bronzes which appear in many parts of the world in the transitional period between arsenical copper and non-arsenical tin- bronzes". Tylecote has suggested that there may have been copper ores in Iran yielding metal with 1%-3% tin.71 Geoy Tepe offers a crude paradigm for the northwest which happily correlates with better data from Caucasia and Russian Azerbaijan. There is a gradual change from pure coppers in level M to arsenical coppers in level K and finally tin-copper alloys in level D, well into the second millennium B.C.72 If indeed regions west of the Zagros were receiving their tin from a source in the Iranian hinterland in the third millennium B.c., its presence at Shahdad and Hissar might be expected to be more marked, especially since Sumerian texts indicate that the mysterious Aratta might have been a source zone. Any conclusions would be premature, save to say that economic considerations greatly restricted the use of tin both in Iran and Mesopotamia until an advanced date in the Bronze Age. Kohl has argued, by implication rather than by demonstration,73 that by the middle of the third millennium B.c. tin had assumed greater significance in the lowland economies of Elam and Sumer than in the less complex economies nearer to the metal's supposed sources; if so, on Beale's "by-pass phenomenon", this may be a case of a trade conducted directly between Mesopotamia and Elamite city-states and those settlements, or rulers, controlling the resource area, by-passing many Iranian regional centres.74 Nor do we know what we mean precisely by a trade in tin, for no ingots are known until the Late Bronze Age in the Levant. Charles has suggested that the development of copper-tin alloys may have followed the successful use of stannite (which looks like primary high arsenical copper ore), for producing a copper alloy, or may have followed the use of an iron gossan flux containing tin.75 In either case it appears that cassiterite quickly becanle the raw material for the introduction of tin into the alloy. (b) The Elamite Tradition: Metal workshops in Susa and other major Elamite centres operated in many ways as part of the broad Mesopotamian metallurgical tradition. But, as in much else, Elam's oscillating relationship with its western neighbours,76 and its federal structure (embracing much of its highland hinterland), brought certain traits to its metal craft-traditions which belong more to the highlands than to the lowlands. Its special position, for so long the pivot between the two, as much economic as cultural, also gave it a political status and a command of resources unequalled in Iran. It is therefore particularly unfortunate that for the third millennium B.c., the archaeological record for Elam offers nothing equivalent to the "Royal Tombs" of Ur by which to assess the levels of skill and the range of technologies then available. An increase in the quantity of base metal artefacts and a steadily-growing typological differentiation mark the earlier third millennium B.C. at Susa.77 If differences there were from Sumer, they are more likely to have been evident in the less utilitarian objects not yet represented in the local archaeological record. By the end of the millennium, certain forms were current whose zoomorphic decoration is in marked contrast to the Sumero-Akkadian craft repertory, in which cast zoomorphic decoration is so rare on tools and weapons as to indicate that it was not a local charac- teristic.78 What little evidence there is at present for tracing the source of this trait leads back to the indigenous Elamite tradition in which there was a marked highland element (see p. 89 below). It is the metalwork, primarily of the thirteenth and twelfth centuries B.c., recovered by excavation at Susa, that indicates particularly well Elam's special position in any history of early metallurgy in Iran. Nowhere else has archaeology revealed traces of the monumental bronzework fitted to adorn a major temple. In one particular case, the foundation deposits of the "Inshushinak Temple", tools and weapons, small statuary and personal ornaments, of varied dates across the second millennium, in base and in precious metals, offer a special picture of local production, which is more akin to that of a major Babylonian city than to any site outside Khuzistan in Iran so far discovered."79 But it is the fragments of a decorated altar, the "Sit Shamashi" model, the pair of inscribed tubular barriers, the</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 89 fragment of an inscribed relief panel and the headless statue of Queen Napir-asu, all of cast bronze, that give Susa a unique place in the archaeological evidence for ancient Near Eastern metallurgy.80 Although such things would have been routine furnishings in many a major Mesopotamian temple, to judge by textual allusions, it is only at Susa that fragments escaped plunderers or recycling. The barriers are over 6 metres long, 20.5 centimetres in diameter and 1.25 centimetres thick, squared for about 60 centimetres at each end. "The metal for each casting was probably poured simultaneously from crucibles through many funnels."8" The statue has never received a full publication, much though it deserves it. It is said to weigh nearly two tons, with an external layer of metal about 2.5 centimetres thick, three times as much at the hands, over a much less compact inner core, perhaps from being poured successively from small crucibles. Recent excavations at Haft Tepe and Tepe Malyan (Anshan) have not added significantly to current knowledge of Middle Elamite metalwork, though an archive of texts from Malyan dealing with precious metals promises to be a valuable addition to the small body of existing textual sources.82 Even in the rich urban centres of Elam it would be a mistake to believe that all base metal tools and weapons were even now necessarily of tin bronze, though documentary evidence from Mesopotamia indicates an east to west tin trade in which Elamites were involved in the earlier second millennium B. c.83 Where copper or arsenical copper was perfectly adequate, as for sickle-blades or arrowheads, it was used and then recycled, as in Mesopotamia. Only where tin made a significant difference, in axeheads or daggerblades, would it have been more regularly used. The Middle Elamite period is notable for the vitality of its glass and faience industries as revealed by the excavations at Tchoga Zanbil.84 This industry, through its use of metals as colourants, of closely related pyrotechnologies, and of comparable methods of casting objects, always had intimate links with contemporary metallurgy. (c) The Earlier Luristan Bronze Industry: The series of graveyards in Luristan, long well-known for the quantity of base metal objects robbed from them by peasant excavators, begins in the second quarter of the third millennium B.C., is broken for much of the second millennium, between about 1800 and 1350 B.c., and then reopens to run for about six centuries. The wide range of copper tools, weapons, vessels and personal ornaments now available, from the controlled excavations of mid and later third millennium B.c. graves by the Belgian Luristan Expedition in western Luristan, indicates, as had previously only been assumed from typological study of clandestine finds, that their repertory was part of a common tradition embracing much of' central and southern Mesopotamia into the Zagros foothills.85 More scattered, and less satisfactory evidence from eastern Luristan reveals a further extension of this craft tradition.86 Even if there was a trade in finished objects, it was probably localized, and there is no reason to assume, as some have, that this metalwork reached Luristan from major urban workshops away to the south or southwest. The distribution of cemeteries away from settlements at this time may show the growing importance in Luristan of transhumance and the emergence of a pattern of living characteristic of the region down to modern times. If so, it is likely that the general community of metal types and techniques over a wide area, which had to import its metal from the plateau to the east, is explained by production in a few settlements and distribution by exchange along regular annual migration routes, which may also have seen the passage of ingots or selected ore fragments. If it has indeed been securely demonstrated that tools in graves of the earlier third millennium B.c. in the Jebel Hamrin in eastern Iraq are made of Talmessi native copper, then an exchange route, along Luristan's northern border, through the Zagros, seems certain.87 Artefacts from uncontrolled excavations in Luristan, the earliest dating back to sometime in the middle of the third millennium B.c., have long indicated the existence of a style of zoomorphic cast decoration on tools and weapons that may be a local trait. Parallel decoration in Sumer is so rare as to suggest that it was not at home there.88 In Western Iran such decoration, with occasional human themes, appears on the butts of axes and adzeheads89 and on maceheads,90 all with plain counterparts from excavations in Sumer, Elam and western Iran. More subtle, and more obviously distinct from the Mesopotamian tradition, is the zoomorphic transformation of a group of hammers. Birds' heads and plumage were added to them, and by the IIIrd Dynasty of Ur (ca. 2112-2004 B.c.) exotic forms were</page><page sequence="10">90 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES current at Susa and elsewhere within the Elamite orbit, with some indication from inscriptions and scenes on cylinder seals that they were insignia: presentation pieces.91 There is here, whether developed within the highland hinterland of Elam or in its lowland centres, the first clear sign of a distinctive Iranian style, in which a sharp eye for natural forms and a highly developed casting skill blended to produce vigorous and evocative animal decoration, natural and supernatural. Both had a long prehistory in glyptic. (d) Developed Plateau Traditions: 1 Kerman and South-Central Iran. It is eastwards of greater Elam that research since 1965 has most conspicuously increased knowledge of long-distance overland exchanges and cultural interaction, as well as of local developments, in the third millennium B.c. The second millennium remains as obscure as ever. In a number of settlements in the Early Bronze Age, conspicuous wealth and growing social and economic differentiations within local communities are indicated by concentrations of metalwork and jewellery, as well as other luxury items, in certain graves in central and eastern Iran and into modern Afghanistan.92 Comparative chronologies are not yet fine enough, nor is the relevant data published in enough detail, for this network of contact to be fully described and then provisionally explained in anything but the broadest terms. It is already apparent that the demands of Mesopotamian city-states for Iranian finished goods in some cases had significant repercussions deep into the source zones. In a stimulating paper, evolved from his trace and stylistic analyses of the widely-dispersed carved chlorite vessels, produced in part at Tepe Yahya, Kohl has sought to explain this in some detail.93 His primary case, that a food dependency on Lower Mesopotamia in the Iranian hinterland communities modified their social and political structure, was cogently criticized by many commentators.94 Aschmann, in particular, briefly but very convincingly challenged the hypothesis on the basis of the inherent logistical problems. He went on to postulate that "an aristocracy, perhaps derived from chieftaincies, was already established on the Iranian plateau that sought such luxuries (i.e., in his view, incense, aromatics, unguent oils and gums redistributed by Sumer) and could command production of a specialized product to exchange them."95 Although the metal industries, as represented in the present archaeological record, are not easy to enrol in this fundamental discussion, two general points may be made at this stage. As yet no metal objects have been found east of Malyan and Sialk that may confidently be described as either "Sumerian" or "Elamite"; but the eye may detect sufficient typological and stylistic traits in objects made to the east to indicate the transmission of metallurgical information along the main routes of exchange linking Elam to the hinterland, and beyond to the frontiers of Central Asia. In the long run, morestimulating for future research is Sarianidi's observation, in replying to Kohl, that draws attention to "primitive money", a topic so far rarely explored in Near Eastern archaeology, beyond vague comments about ring torcs/ingots. Arguing that barter grows gradually into trade only after the appearance of the first variants of a universal equivalent form of value (money), Sarianidi pointed out that "the role of money may be played by various equivalent goods, but the rise of metallurgy facilitated the development of primitive money in the form of metal. In addition to ingots, it is believed that this money could also have taken the form of metal articles whose original practical significance was often deliberately altered, as, for example, in the case of 5-7 cm long miniature axes from Hissar and Sialk, which have now also been found in the cemeteries of Bactria. It is conjectured that the metal 'pins', shaped in the form of a rod with one end beaten flat and the other having a droplet-shaped bulge, which were widely distributed in Central Asia and adjacent areas in the fourth to second millennium aB.C., may also have played the part of equivalent money."''96 Although an old chance find"97 had indicated that the Kerman region, rich in metal ores, might have had important local industries in antiquity, it was only with the excavations at Tall-i Iblis, already discussed (p. 83) and those at Khabis (Shahdad), that they became a reality. Any assessment of the metalworking at Shahdad, 120 kilometres east of Kerman, is hazardous in view of the difficulties of establishing any reliable chronological equivalents from the scattered and scanty published reports.9" The workshop area has already been described (p. 83). The graveyards cover a wide area extending for</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 91 several square kilometres round the settlement in a region where vertical stratigraphy is virtually absent and erosion by wind and water a constant hazard to traces of the past. Very broadly speaking, three main chronological phases appear to be represented among the published grave goods. The earliest graves, perhaps of the late fourth millennium B.c. or soon after, held relatively few metal objects, primarily of copper, with occasional lead vessels. By Early Dynastic III in Mesopotamian terms (Yahya IVB) axeheads already carried zoomorphic decoration. Objects in the latest, and most richly equipped of the graves, present close affinities with the material culture of Yahya IVA, and the Kaftari period in Fars, extending from about 2200 B.C. into the second millennium B.C. In so far as objects have been analysed, this is a predominantly arsenical copper industry, with arsenic readings of up to 4% and 5%.99 The repertory of tools and weapons embraces forms found also at Susa, among them axeheads of Deshayes Type G.4,'00 exotic axeheads with curling blades and plumed butts,'0' and maceheads.102 Among a variety of standard sheetmetal vessels one form is distinctive: dishes with repousse designs on the interior base, exactly paralleled at Hissar.'o3 A unique, decorated sheetmetal standard is again of arsenical copper, and Vatandoost-Haghighi has also shown that some pins "were probably made from a particularly high arsenic alloy (4-5%) in order that the rapid cooling of the molten metal forced the copper arsenic eutectic to the surface by inverse segregation, imparting a silver colour to the pin."'04 Distinctive openwork copper seals reveal (very much as do the "pins" cited by Sarianidi and mentioned above), more strikingly than the weapon and tool repertory, the trans-Iranian contacts of the period. Though initially of east Iranian origin, they are found from Bactria (where they are taken to denote clan or family not personal property) through Shahr-i Sokhta and Shahdad to Susa.'-5 Shahdad was poised as much culturally as it was geographically between Elam, embracing Anshan in Fars, and what Tosi has defined as the "Turanic cultural zone" embracing northeastern Iran, much of Afghanistan, and adjacent regions of the U.S.S.R.'06 Metallurgically this vast area offers fresh perspectives and much new information, which go far beyond the range of this survey. But passing mention must be made of Shahr-i Sokhta, the only major relevant site within Iran. It is reported to have yielded few metal finds either in the cemetery or in the settlement.'07 From the settlement two out- standing objects may do no more than indicate the potential of this whole region for future study: a decorated sheet silver spatula reminiscent of a find at Shahdad,'08 and a cast copper statuette of a woman carrying a vessel on her head. 09 Tepe Yahya has already been discussed (pp. 86-7). Far to the southeast of Kerman, the southern part of Iranian Baluchistan has long found a place in studies of early metallurgy on account of a single object. This is the cast copper pickaxe, decorated on the butt with a camel, from a grave in trench E of Stein's excavations at Khurab.1 It was associated with pottery now recognized as of Bampur V type, sheet copper and alabaster vessels, and an agate bead with gold caps. It is currently dated within a century or so of 2000 B.C. The pickaxe is of arsenical copper, with antimony and lead as the major impurities. It was cast in a single solid piece, with a core placed inside the mould to create the shafthole. It is not clear whether it is a unique lost-wax casting or whether, as would have been quite possible, it was made in a piece mould, perhaps bivalve, in which a series of such artefacts could have been cast."' At Bampur itself, metal finds were rare, notably a compartmented seal in Level IV, reported to be a tin-bronze, and a fragment of lead sulphide (galena) in level V.112 (d) 2. Early Bronze Age Hissar and the Roots of the "Iranian Tradition" Renewed research in recent years at Tepe Hissar has increased its key position in understanding cultural developments in a crucial part of Iran. Until Dyson's reassessment of Schmidt's presentation of the internal chronology of Hissar III has been published, spanning as it does the third millennium B.c., the metalwork of this long phase is best taken as an individual unit, though fine distinctions may be expected in due course. A much greater variety of metals, forms and techniques is evident after Hissar II; but, as has already been pointed out, it remains overwhelmingly a copper/arsenical copper industry. When so much of the material evidence cited here is from graves, the metal artefacts in the "Burned Building", attributed to Schmidt's IIIB, assume unusual importance. This large domestic building, destroyed in a military assault, which trapped some of its occupants in the debris, yielded</page><page sequence="12">92 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES copper daggers and spearheads, with indications of hilt and shaft decoration in precious metals; a gold cup, silver and copper vessels; silver beads and belt (?) fittings; copper tools and seals; lumps of lead and copper."3 Technically the most individual object is a copper dish with a lion in high repouss6, and its prey a bull in lower relief, on the inside base.1"4 Sheetmetal was also imaginatively used for silhouette ornaments, as in the moufflon head from "Hoard I on Treasure Hill" (Schmidt's IIIC)," which prefigures the ornaments of the central Asiatic nomads of later millennia. A standard range of cast copper tools and weapons was mass-produced, as in Western Iran, but within a distinctive typological range with relatives elsewhere in northern Iran. Local fashions are still more evident in such lost-wax castings as the "wands""6 and zoomorphically decorated maceheads."7 Animal pendants belong to a universal fashion; but here turtles mark more local tastes.l"8 The survival of the Hissar craft tradition in the very obscure period following the end of IIIC in Schmidt's system, some time in the first half of the second millennium B.C., is examined below (p. 94). Within the Zagros (notably Luristan), and eastwards across the Iranian plateau, the period equivalent to the Middle and Late Bronze Age in Syro-Palestinian terminology is obscure and the metallurgical information too meagre to warrant any discussion here. 3. The Emergence of an Iron Technology and Iron I-III in Western Iran: (a) The New Metal. Iron had been known and used in the Near East to a very limited extent since at least the third millennium B.C. Recent laboratory research has demonstrated more precisely how Bronze Age smiths are likely to have acquired some knowledge of the properties of iron from their use of its ores as fluxing agents in copper smelting."9 In certain circumstances this would have resulted in the occurrence of small pieces of metallic iron. In Iran, copper ores are often available in the same areas as iron ores. It is unfortunate that the analytical information from Geoy Tepe, which might have thrown some valuable light on this preliminary phase in Iran, is compromised by the insecure archaeological contexts of the material examined.'20 The development of iron technology in the Near East was relatively slow, if this long perspective is taken into account, with only Anatolia having anything approaching an iron industry before about 1200 B.c. Complex factors inhibited wider developments, some political and economic, but at least one was technological. Any rapid spread of iron technology was unlikely until an iron with a sufficiently high carbon content had been produced to match the hardness and strength of good tin-bronze. It needed supplies of tin to become sufficiently restricted to force the fuller exploitation of iron ores. It looks at present as if this was the primary catalyst in the Levant towards the end of the thirteen century B.C., when interrelated political and economic disruption provoked a tin famine. Its extent and its duration are obscure and certainly varied from area to area; but the critical places were Cyprus and southeast Anatolia, where "Hittite" craft traditions had established the necessary basic technology and where iron ores were available within the same production and distribution networks as had long been established for copper and tin-bronze. Now that detailed studies of early iron working in Syro-Palestine and Assyria are available,121 it is easier to place Iran in the mainstream Near Eastern development of iron technology in the critical centuries from about 1200 to 900 B.C. It may no longer be seen as the precocious industry that was once postulated on the basis of elaborate, uncertainly dated, iron swords reported on the antiquities market as from Luristan. Pigott has provided thorough surveys of the available evidence for iron during Iron I-III (ca. 1450/1350-550 B.c.) in Iran.'22 He ended his review of Iron I-II in 1977 on a cautionary note: "The subsequent development of iron metallurgy during Iron II, it has been suggested, might have resulted from a combination of circumstances involving trade, if not in iron itself, then in iron technology... Yet even in the Iron II period crucial data is lacking i.e. evidence for the actual production of iron from properly dated contexts. What remains to be demonstrated effectively is the existence and/or the nature of Iron I metal technology as a possible prelude locally to the industrial production of iron during the Iron II period."'23 If it is accepted that a developed Bronze Age technology will involve a latent knowledge of iron through the smelting process, it would not need much cultural interaction from a more developed iron industry to stimulate local production, particularly where iron ores were accessible within the</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 93 existing copper distribution network. As I argued some years ago, and Pigott agrees,124 the use of iron to decorate bronze, the technique of casting on (for bronze on to bronze before bronze on to iron), and the production of pieces of unhomogeneous unintenti6nal, carburized iron, in Iron I in Iran, as much as the availability of the ores, offered an ideal situation for the relatively rapid spread of an iron technology after adoption. The initial stimulus may well have been part of the emulation of Assyria in certain parts of western Iran well described by Irene Winter in her study of the local style at Hasanlu. 2s Nor would the subsequent ascendancy of Urartu have slowed down the developing industry, for it had an important iron tradition of its own by the eighth century and may well have been interested in Iranian iron ore sources.126 There is no good reason to think, whatever the value of the hypothesis in other contexts, that the introduction and initial spread of an iron technology in western Iran was complementary to the penetration there of Iranian-speaking peoples in Iron I-II. Nor do analyses of bronze objects dating to Iron I-III in western Iran, and the quantity of them placed in tombs, offer grounds for thinking that unusual difficulty in obtaining tin was a crucial factor in encouraging the growth of a local iron industry in this region. As Pigott demonstrated, there is no evidence for a significant local production of iron in Iran in Iron I (ca. 1450/1350-1000 B.c.). The only iron objects of this period to have received proper laboratory examination are the iron blade of a dagger with a cast bronze hilt, a spearpoint and a punch from Marlik.127 It is not clear whether or not they had been intentionally carburized to convert them to steel. By the end of the ninth century, towards the end of Iron II the situation had markedly changed, at least in major urban centres; Hasanlu IV is reported to have yielded "an immense assemblage of iron artefacts",'28 though "steeling" was not yet intentional. The forms and decoration of these objects offer no reason to doubt they were made in the area, if not at Hasanlu itself. Iron sources within Iran'29 are quite sufficient to explain the evolution of a series of local industries once the value, and the manner, of their exploitation had been appreciated through contact with older iron industries to the west. Another argument for judging western contacts to have been instrumental in this respect is provided by the negative evidence from eastern Iran. Iron objects are still exceedingly rare in archaeological contexts in eastern Iran and Turkmenia dated before the second quarter of the first millennium B.c. The growth of an iron industry in this region is still best explained by commercial contacts and cultural interaction with western Iran in Iron II-III.l3o The steady increase of iron production in western Iran may be crudely gauged from graveyards in western Luristan excavated by the Belgian Expedition. Fine chronological distinctions are not easy, since graves were often re-used. Those of Iron I are virtually without iron objects; those of Iron II have some iron as rings, bracelets, daggers and arrowheads; only those of Iron III contain a developed range of iron artefacts.'3' It is this sequence which allows the famous series of decorated iron swords reported from Luristan in the last fifty years to be placed in a technological sequence'32 and approximately dated. It has been realized for some time now that their cumbersome assembly from many parts and their metallurgical structure offered no evidence for precocious skills with iron as a metal, only unusual ingenuity in adapting bronze technology to the less tractable new metal in the ninth to eighth centuries B.c. Smiths were skilled in forging, but had little knowledge of welding, and instead used elaborately-fitted joints to simulate bronze shapes. In Young's restudy of Giyan, iron was rare in Giyan I(4-2), but in I(1), 23% of the metal recovered was ironwork,'33 in the eighth century B.c. Clare Goffs excavations at Baba Jan Tepe in eastern Luristan have now offered vital complementary data from a settlement site where iron tools, rather than the weapons and ornaments usual in graves, are to be expected. In the burnt level IIB, dated in the first half of the seventh century, iron was well represented, including fragments of dagger blades, a spearhead, and arrowheads. In the "Carpenter's Shop" were an iron adze, knife and chisel blades; hoes, spades and sickles illustrate that iron was also by then the regular metal for agricultural tools.'34 In the shrine at Dum Surkh in central Luristan, iron occurred in all levels from the tenth- or ninth- century foundation, but was four times more common in the final, seventh-century, level.'35 In more central sites, like Tepe Sialk, very much the same pattern is evident. It is not until the time of cemetery "B" at Sialk, ca. 850/800 to 700/650 B.c., that iron clearly becomes an important constituent of the local metal industry, and it is possible even then that some, if not all, the ironwork was imported.'36</page><page sequence="14">94 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES 3 (b) Western Iranian Metal Industries in the Iron Age: (i) The North-West: the Developed "Iranian" Traditions: No primary question about the cultural evolution of Iran in the second millennium B.c. is as obscure as the precise relationship between the Early Bronze Age settlements of the Hissar region and the settlements and cemeteries of Iron I like Khurvin, 80 km northwest of Tehran, Marlik and other sites in Gilan and Mazanderan, and Talish.13" Without entering upon a discussion that has been fully explored in other places, and has only just begun, it is necessary here to point to those aspects of the metal repertory which indicate a common, if splintered, ancestry. A shared range of copper/bronze tools and weapons has long been evident and has been investigated by a number of scholars. This embraces certain forms which are distinct, for instance, from those of Luristan in Iron I-II, where the Mesopotamian/Elamite repertory was established. Nor in the northwest are bronze weapons, with the rare exception of certain maceheads, decorated. Harness trappings are also generally plain; animal pendants occur in both areas, but distinguished by the contrasts in their natural fauna: stag and zebu most often in Gilan, caprids and moufflon in Luristan. Whereas the human figure is transposed into a world of fantasy in Luristan, often blending man and wild animals, in Gilan it remains very much in the real world. It has recently become apparent that at least one very striking technique, unusually high repousse' sheetmetal decoration, evident on dishes from Hissar and Shahdad already mentioned (p. 91), then at Marlik in the fine goldwork for which the site is famous, was used at Hasanlu, in level IV (ca. 1000-800 B. c.), for sheet bronze in a manner, and for motifs, found over a thousand years earlier in northeast Iran.'38 The southwest Caspian region in Iron I presents any student of pre-Achaemenid metalworking in Iran with one of the most outstanding groups of material evidence, and the most complex instance of a recurrent question: is the extraordinary group of fine metalwork from excavations, controlled and un- controlled, in this area indigenous (though its immediate antecedents are for the moment unknown) or were these objects brought in from elsewhere either by commerce or by a displaced 6lite from elsewhere in Iran taking refuge in this relatively isolated region, as in later Iranian history? No firm answer is yet possible; but the weight of archaeological and art-historical evidence is in favour of production centres, if not actually in Gilan, then certainly in northwest Iran, with active trading contacts southwestwards to Assyria in one direction, southwards to Elam and its Zagros dependencies in the other in Iron I.139 That the "Iranian" craft tradition current in northeast Iran late in the third millennium s.c. had supported craftsmen working skilfully in precious metals and producing sheetmetal vessels in them, as in copper, is indicated not only at Tepe Hissar but also by what is known of the long lost "Treasure of Astarabad".'40 There is some suggestion from old reports that the decoration on the Astarabad vessels was in repousse, and not just linear incision. Finds from Hasanlu V and IV, very few of which are yet published, indicate the vitality of the local metal industry in Iron I-II, whilst the exceptionally fortunate discovery there in level IV of a decorated silver beaker and gold bowl, commonly accepted to be of local manufacture, particularly reinforce the case for judging the Marlik repertory to be indigenous. Although analyses had been done on objects circulated through the antiquities market as from "Amlash", the entrepdt for clandestinely excavated objects in Gilan, it was not until the Japanese published analyses of their finds in Dailaman'41 and until Vatandoost-Haghighi'42 did similar work on finds from Marlik that more confident statements could be made about this industry. Arsenical coppers and relatively pure coppers were still used, but a fully fledged tin-bronze production is evident. Even with the small existing group of analyses, a pattern has begun to emerge that correlates with comparable results from other parts of the Near East at the end of the second millennium B.c. The average Iranian tin-bronzes of the period have 5%-7% tin. Arrowheads fall generally below this range, spearheads and simpler dagger blades into it, or just above, whilst some of the fine swords of Iron I in northwest Iran may have tin percentages up to and above 12%. A double-headed hammer from Marlik, weighing 1080 grammes, was at the top of the scale (13.5% Sn), suggesting that the smith knew the effective limits for an annealed and work-hardened alloy that would not be dangerously brittle.'43 Iron I in the southwest Caspian area is renowned for the skill and beauty of its zoomorphic pottery, which is boldly modelled, with a sensitive appreciation of three-dimensional, if stylized,</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 95 forms. With wax rather than clay as their medium, these modellers easily found a cast metal counter- part for such vessels and figurines. Their lost-wax castings are not as accomplished as those of Luristan at this time. In Gilan, the wax parts of which the figure was built up are much more evident. But, as in Luristan, there seems to have been no appreciation that controlled use of lead would have facilitated the casting; only the tin content seems to have been controlled, usually below the average for tools and weapons. 3 (b) (ii) The Later Luristan Bronze Industry: One of the most striking phenomena of the West Iranian Iron Age was the remarkable vigour of the bronze industry of Luristan, witnessed by the unusual quantity, even for Iran, of base metalwork deposited in graves. Luristan remains exceptional for the variety of its bronze repertory and the diversity of its decorative skills at this time, both in cast and sheetmetalwork. The origin, the distribution, and the demise of this industry remain matters for debate. In the last fifteen years, the Belgian Luristan Expedition, directed by Professor Vanden Berghe, has for the first time placed the study of the subject on a sound basis with data from a series of dated cemeteries, extending back into the prehistoric period.'44 Perhaps not surprisingly in view of their location, these graveyards have yielded metalwork that may be assimilated with little difficulty into the late second and early first millennium craft traditions of Elam and Mesopotamia so far as they are presently known. Marks of a distinctive tradition, notably examples of the most elaborate "Luristan Bronzes", have been rare finds in this region. Clare Goffs surveys, and her important excavation of a settlement at Baba Jan Tepe, focused attention once more on the area south of Harsin, whence in the 1930s most of the clandestinely excavated elaborate "Luristan Bronzes" were said to have come. In 1980 she gave a vivid thumbnail sketch of her conclusions: "Following the introduction of the domesticated horse, second millennium society in Luristan became increasingly tribal and nomadic, dominated by a warrior aristocracy. In the early first millennium B.C., Iranian migrants pushing down from the north completed the process, bringing to central Luristan a new style of military architecture, and inspiring smiths and armourers to fresh flights of fancy in the decoration of their weapons and horse trappings."'45 Two decorated bronzes were excavated at Baba Jan: a Janus-headed tube from the "Fort" on the East Mound and a decorated pin from the "Manor" on the Central Mound.'46 The implications of this fresh archaeological information for understanding the Luristan bronze industry between Iron I and III may best be assessed by taking in turn first the west, then the east, of the province. In the west, the bronze-work of Iron I cemeteries already included spike-butted axeheads, flange-hilted daggers, whetstone sockets cast as animals and "standard finials" in the form of rampant wild goats, naturalistically modelled. They indicate that certain traits of form and decoration, taken to be particularly characteristic of this industry, were already present by the thirteenth or twelfth centuries B.C., though at present they have no local ancestry. Cast tools and weapons embellished with zoomorphic or anthropomorphic decoration may be traced back into the Early Bronze (p. 89); but the finials are still not yet known elsewhere. This is a time when Elamite authority in the region, albeit sporadic, was superseded by a Babylonian (Kassite) presence, documented by a series of inscribed bronzes and some textual evidence from Mesopotamia.'47 Brinkman'48 has argued that in the tenth century, especially, when Aramaeans on Babylonia's western frontiers disturbed commerce, Babylonia had close ties with people in the Zagros area living on either side of the modern Baghdad-Kermanshah route. It is in Iron II, from about 1000/900 B.c. to the early eighth century in Luristan, that the peak of this bronze industry now appears to have been reached. An exotic and flamboyant, often non-realistic style of cast bronze decoration was extensively used, and a matching style developed in linear decoration of sheetmetal, as is illustrated in fragments from the Dum Surkh shrine.'"49 It was at this time that circumstances, not yet fully understood, allowed for a strong resurgence of local imagery. Wherever it may be checked back, the iconography of the "Luristan Bronzes" runs deep into Elamite or hinterland prehistory.'5? Local craftsmen were now producing a whole repertory of often richly- decorated bronze objects without close parallels elsewhere; only iron objects, in increasing numbers, indicate strong metallurgical contacts outside the region, but whether through trade and cultural</page><page sequence="16">96 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES interaction or through actual migrations is not yet certain. In Iron III, until some time in the seventh century B.c., marked changes, apart from a growing iron industry (see p. 92), are evident in the equipment of graves. Bronze and iron maceheads, fibulae and certain sheetmetal vessel shapes indicate strong contacts with the west, explained in part by growing Assyrian military penetration into northwestern Luristan (? ancient Ellipi), in part by Assyrian deportation of people from North Syria to eastern Mesopotamia.'5" It may be to this period that some of the most elaborately decorated cheekpieces for horse-bits belong, as a number of the monsters used to decorate them show marked affinities to the same creatures represented on North Syrian sculptures. Very few of these elaborate harness-trappings have been recovered by controlled excavation. In central and eastern Luristan, rather different external factors were operative and their impact is still obscure. Clare Goff's researches have indicated that the Kuh-i Sefid may have marked a crucial cultural frontier within Luristan in the Iron I-III periods. To the west of it in Hulailan, in the Kuh-i Dasht and in the Pusht-i Kuh, to judge from ceramics, the indigenous population apparently lived unmolested by any major threat from the north or northeast until an advanced date in Iron III. It is this population which provided the creative force in the Luristan bronze industry. Who the creators of the Baba Jan "manors" were, perhaps a branch of the Medes as Clare Goff has suggested, remains an open question. On the broadest archaeological view, they may best be accommodated at present within the cultural horizon of cemetery "B" at Tepe Sialk. The most characteristic Luristan repertory in bronze in the Iron Age was an isolated phenomenon; its production ended relatively abruptly sometime in the seventh century B.c., and none of its individual traits may be recognized in what is known so far of the ensuing material culture in western Iran. 3 (c) The Local Roots of the Achaemenid Tradition: Metalwork that may confidently be associated with either the Medes or the Persians before the Achaemenid supremacy is unknown, as indeed is any ceramic. If we may argue backwards from the distinctively "Iranian" elements in the military equipment of the Achaemenid army, and take it as most indicative of what the Medo-Persian contribution might have been, then we find a personal armoury unlike anything so far known in other parts of western Iran. This aspect of Achaemenid material culture is nowhere well represented as yet within Iran by small finds, not even in the military debris recovered from Persepolis, though the reliefs there offer valuable pictorial information on personal equipment. But it is present in a small military cemetery on the upper Euphrates, near Jerablus (Carchemish) in Turkey, where there is sufficient evidence to provide a basis for discussion of the arms and armour of "Iranian" troops within the Achaemenid military establishment in the provinces."'52 From this basis, a South Russian/Transcaucasian component may be tentatively postulated. The akinakes dagger, the sagaris battle axe, the bronze socketed trefoil arrowhead, and possibly less distinctive forms of iron knives, spearheads and javelin heads found with them in sixth-or fifth-century "Achaemenid" contexts, all have a Transcaucasian, mainly Georgian ancestry, in previous centuries.'53 It will not be possible to trace the introduction and spread of this armoury in Iran until more sites of the Iron III period have been excavated and fully published. It is to this chronological phase that the genuine objects in the now notorious "Ziwiye Hoard" largely belong. Muscarella has recently offered an exhaustive examination not so much of these artefacts as of the bibliography that has grown up around them in the last thirty years.'54 His primary argument, that objects recovered by un- controlled digging may not be used as if they were from controlled excavation, is unanswerable, and his paper introduced a necessary critical rigour into an aspect of ancient Iranian studies that was rapidly running out of control. But if the genuine objects within this category are taken one by one, with no unfounded assumptions about source or association, they provide for western Iran, as the "Treasure of the Oxus" has long done for the subsequent period in eastern Iran, a still unique point of reference. In time, though it may be a long time, it will be superseded by better evidence, notably from excavations recently conducted by an Iranian Expedition at Ziwiye itself."'55 Until then, or at least until a latter-day Dalton brings a dispassionate and discriminating eye to bear on each item assembled under the epithet "Ziwiye" in the literature, this body of objects may do no more than to alert students</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY AND PRE-ACHAEMENID METALWORKING IN IRAN 97 of metalwork to various aspects of acculturation in northwest Iran at this time. Two are of outstanding importance and both are very relevant to any attempt to discern an emerging Medo-Persian tradition in metalwork. The Urartian constituent, recognized in the earliest "Ziwiye" studies, has since been placed upon a sound archaeological basis by surveys and by excavations in northwest Iran, as at Bastam'56 and Haftavan,'" and by a growing body of data from Urartian sites to the west in Turkey and the U.S.S.R. Political and commercial circumstances suggest that the Urartian presence in Iron III in northwest Iran'" provided for a stronger cultural impact than the earlier and less direct Assyrian relationship evident in Hasanlu IV.'59 The Scythian character of certain motifs and artefacts in the "Ziwiye Hoard" called attention to an important element in the population of Kurdistan in Iron III, whose presence is also archaeologically evident further north. Horse-burials, distinctive "Scythian" harness-trappings, and perhaps even some pottery, in Hasanlu III,160an animal-headed whetstone and bronze axeheads from the cemetery of Se Girdan,'66 and various artefacts of unknown source, notably bone cheekpieces for horse-bits, may be related to archaeological material from Transcaucasia and South Russia to provide a coherent indication of Scythian penetration. This is consistent with the argument, based on written sources, that the Scythians' "28 years rule over Asia" refers to western Iran, with a focus in Iranian Kurdistan, during the second half of the seventh century B.c. Arguably, it was through their Scythian contacts, rather than directly, that the Medes, and other Iranian-speaking peoples, adopted weapon types developed earlier in Transcaucasia and then passed them on into the personal armoury of certain troops in the Achaemenid army. An "Asiatic" or "Nomadic" strain in Achaemenid metalwork is also evident in the use of silhouette sheetgold cutouts sewn on to clothes as among the Scythians, and in a love of rich colouring, satisfied in metalwork by elaborately inlaid jewellery of types not evident before in Iran or the Near East. By contrast, the repertory of gold, silver-gilt and silver tableware, so typical of the Achaemenid international style, owed as much to western court styles of the previous few hundred years as to any local Iranian craft tradition known at present. C. RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT In view of the subject's immaturity, conclusions are not appropriate. The most that may be offered are a few closing comments on certain aspects of the early history of metallurgy as they appear at present from an Iranian standpoint. 1. The emergence of a copper metallurgy may have been more multifacetted than is commonly allowed for in most general accounts of primitive metallurgy. Isolating first annealed native copper, then cast, melted native copper, smelted oxide copper ores, and arsenical copper "alloys" in a quasi- evolutionary series of stages does not adequately account for what seems to be a more varied and flexible set of circumstances in the initial phase of discovery and exploitation. This may have taken place in the Anarak-Talmessi region, where from the first application of a pyrotechnology to copper, there was the possibility of employing alone, or in combination, melted native copper, copper arsenides, and smelted oxide copper ores. Sufficient is now known of the earliest local developments of lime burning and pottery kiln construction to encourage the view that there was no technological bar to virtually simultaneous discovery of a broad range of support technologies for a spectrum of minerals found in association. As Charles'62 has reminded us, idle curiosity-the age-old fascination of fire for adult and child alike-should never be underestimated in this initial stage of "playing" with copper minerals. There is no firm evidence yet from Iran for the period at which sulphide ores were first regularly smelted there. 2. Even if it should emerge conclusively that alloys of native copper with copper arsenides are not as early as smelted oxide copper ores, enough indicators are available to suggest the hypothesis that coppers and arsenical coppers were used as the predominant constituent of most, if not all, metal industries for a very long time, from at least sometime before the middle of the fourth millennium B.c. until the end of the second. It must now be seriously questioned whether it is possible to say, at least of Iran, as Charles does in general, that "the period in which copper-arsenic alloys were used was, as stated, short in comparison with the long period during which tin bronze was produced in very large</page><page sequence="18">98 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES quantities and was the material which both dominated the cultural pattern and typifies this Age of Man".'63 At the moment it may be doubted whether, outside the great Elamite urban centres, tin- bronzes were common in Iran much before the middle of the second millennium B.C. and, even in Susa, social and economic factors may long have controlled their production and distribution. It is by no means established that tin-bronzes have superior properties to arsenical coppers nor that the production of arsenical coppers had such a devastating impact on the health of the smiths as to put their production into eclipse in favour of the safer tin-copper alloy. 3. It was only in the fourth millennium B.c. that occasional finds of gold, silver and lead objects indicate the end of a predominantly copper metallurgy in Iran and the emergence of "polymetallism" as defined by Wertime. The earlier absence of lead, in view of its precocious appearance in Anatolia and Mesopotamia, may be mere archaeological chance, or just inadequate publication. 4. If it is correct to stress the prevalence of copper and arsenical coppers, why then was tin-bronze eventually adopted ? Its value as a traded item in ancient Iran by at least the earlier second millennium B.c. is now generally accepted, whatever its ultimate source; but its impact within local metallurgies is far less evident. It appears to have been a status commodity from some time in the third millennium B.c. in western Iran; but that alone would hardly explain its rise to prominence by the closing stages of a copper-based (as opposed to an iron) metallurgy. It is possible that the earlier arsenical coppers were based on the reduction of naturally oxidized ores, such as malachite, with arsenates, and that the move to sulphidic copper ores in Iran necessarily eliminated arsenic and increasingly required the use of another addition. 5. Whereas it is arguable that the various technologies of a copper-based metallurgy were pioneered in Iran largely independent of foreign stimulus, the techniques of an iron-based metallurgy were adopted after contact with western workshops pioneering this metal. The resources of local communities were not generally committed to iron working in western Iran until sometime in the tenth century B.c. and somewhat later in eastern Iran, and there is no reason to associate this development closely with any migrations of Iranian-speaking peoples. The evolution and adoption of the new technology was controlled by independent factors not yet elucidated. 6. When a country of such interest as Iran first really emerges into the archaeological record, as it may be said to have done in the last thirty years, there is a constant risk of trying to run before we can walk, not least when seeking to apply explanatory models to inadequate or only partially published data. This is nowhere more apparent than when we make any move to integrate developing metallurgy with changes in contemporary society, for, save in certain isolated cases like Susa, we have little or no idea of the level of socio-political development at particular sites at specific times, nor of the economic relevance and status within any one community of its metal production. Until we are able to focus with accuracy on such crucial variables across the whole country, any assessment of the impact of metallurgical innovations on local communities and their institutions is wholly conjectural. It is in this respect, almost more than any other, that full publication of the major excavations conducted in Iran in the last twenty years may be expected to improve understanding of the role metal-working played in Iranian prehistory. Acknowledgements My debt to other scholars will be evident from the bibliography; but I would like to single out two here.
