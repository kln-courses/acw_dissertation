<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM A CONFESSION OF FAITH BY WINIFRED KIRKLAND Does intercourse with departed spirits make the living more spiritual? Psychic research replies with an unequivocal "yes". To reply with an unequivocal "no" requires some courage, and even more of plain common sense. Common sense is merely racial instinct accounting for itself. It was to secure itself from backsliding into animality that the human race as it has emerged from the savage toward the man has more and more clearly denied itself recourse to the occult. Evolution has obeyed an undeviating principle from the amoeba to the ape, from the ape to Isaiah, and that principle is the development of inner faculties, mental or moral or religious, only by depending on them. Not the eyes of the body but of the soul, have perceived all the light that has ever affected human progress. You don't strengthen the eyes of the soul by materialising the dead so that the living may see them, on the contrary, you revert to a gross animal de pendence on the eyes of the body. Faith is a far bigger word than our common use of it to mean belief in an unseen God or in an unproved immortality. Faith is the most important faculty the race possesses, and nothing is more perilous for progress than to weaken faith by making it depend on proof. Faith is the power to walk on an hypothesis, and hypothesis is the only bridge by which people have ever crossed from the past into the future. If men had been denied the privilege of acting in accordance with facts they could not prove, if belief of any kind had ever been conditioned on what we can see with our eyes and hear with our ears and feel with our hands, we should have remained monkeys, we should not today be men. The most searching test of the psychic is the psychological.</page><page sequence="2">84 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW Not, "Can the dead speak to us?" is the root question, but, "What good will it do even if they can?" Every red-blooded brain resists any tendency toward reversion. Even if psychic research advertises its importance from every publisher's cata logue, shall we human beings voluntarily revert from our de pendence on our own souls, and rush for advice to the souls of the dead? As we look back at history, either universal or individual, and observe the slow, bitter spiritualising of humanity, does it really appear ever to have been safe to consult any human spirit except that one which faces us so mysteriously in the glass every morning? In order to examine the spiritualising power of spiritism, sup pose psychic communication to have become as popular as some new method of telephoning; what results should a plain common sense knowledge of human nature expect if the ouija board be come as common a household convenience as the telephone receiver? In the first place, all materialists would leave the psychic alone except as offering problems for the pathologist. Materialists are not people to be despised, for many of them through their whole-hearted attention to the mysteries of life are doing work of highest service for the slow upward climb of human ity toward liberation. It is less dangerous to evolution to ex aggerate the mystery of matter, as do many of our noblest scientists, than to neglect the mystery of matter as do many noble spiritists. Further, spiritist and materialist can hardly afford to scorn each other, for each is a little responsible for the other's creed. As today's preoccupation with the psychic marks the far swing of the pendulum away from yesterday's preoccupa tion with the material, so today's spiritism is confirming if not producing, a good deal of materialism. The methods and the message of much psychic communication are so grotesque, and the effect on mentality so regrettable, that the instant rejection by materialists of all psychic claims is largely the assertion of healthy human instincts. Perhaps an honest materialist would rather not have a soul than have the sort of soul spiritism de scribes. Perhaps of all creeds materialism sees most clearly that spiritism is unspiritual. So much for the effect of psychic research on people who don't</page><page sequence="3">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 85 believe it. There remains to divide the people who do believe it into those who think and those who don't. Five years ago it would have seemed absurd to analyse the dangers of spiritism as applied to everyday living, but today the popularity of the psychic is so amazing both among thinking and among un thinking people that simply for one's own clarity and stability it is well to recognise its fallible psychology. In print and in con versation one observes much facile credulity in regard to psychic research and as much facile mockery, but very little of civil refusal to accept its knowledge not of ghosts but of men. Look ing at basic human nature as it is, not as the ingenuous psychic researcher looks at it, one is forced to see the disastrous effect a general acceptance of spiritism would have. The rank and file would degrade all psychic intercourse to mundane purposes, as, obviously, they already do. They would go to mediums for advice in sickness and in financial speculation, for assistance in finding lost articles and in betting on Presidential candidates. It is a significant and arresting fact that no spirit has yet ex pressed any moral inspiration that his interviewer was not capa ble, consciously or subconsciously, of expressing for himself. All authoritative students of the soul, Shakespeare, for example, or Socrates, or Jesus are pretty well agreed that it is incapable of reformation from without, but only from within. A voice from the dead may frighten us, it can't regenerate us, for regeneration is not a psychic but a psychological experience. If therefore we possess a fatal facility for remaining materialist beings in our pur poses, no matter how familiarly we converse with immaterial be ings, then the methods of intermundane intercourse will always expose mediums to the same ordeal that often betrayed Roman augurs and Greek soothsayers: it will be a stout-minded medium who never yields to the temptation of saying whatever will please the sitter! Psychic enthusiasts are sadly ignorant of the healthy toughness of humanity. It never gasps long over the miraculous, it accepts it and goes on its humdrum way. If really converted to the authenticity of automatic writing, the general public would employ that agency to make themselves more luxurious, not more noble. Nine out of ten applications for spirit advice would</page><page sequence="4">86 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW be some variation of the question, "How may I get more money? " This priceless advice could be obtained merely by holding a pencil laxly in the fingers, and all such inquiry could be so secret that none of us would be restrained by wholesome shame before our fellows no matter what selfish desires we might reveal to our ghostly counsellors. The ease with which mankind adjusts itself to all discovery and converts miracles into conveniences for its comfort, might well give pause to those who aver that spiritual reformation would follow the acceptance of spiritist claims. The only people who would use psychic agencies for their own ennobling are the people who think, and these are precisely such as are capable of attaining beauty by those nobler methods which have an age-old sanction. Persons of true aspiration would be debilitated exactly in so far as they turned from their hard-won spiritual insight and vigor to depend on the advice of mediums and of letter-writing controls. Such persons are equipped to get their help from their own souls, if only they will be patient enough to take the trouble. Here and now we have beauty enough to live and die by, without running to the dead to reveal it to us. For the thinking and the unthinking alike, spiritism is the evasion of the responsibility to develop our own vision and our own energy under a handicap surely set us with patient creative purpose. The human soul is capable of being vitalised only by the moral, not by the miraculous. We have forgotten that Jesus looked upon even his raisings from the dead as being "mere works". Incalculable discussion has waged about the authenticity of the gospel miracles. The essential point is not whether or not the miracles were true, the essential point is that Jesus scorned them, and the people who needed them. The proof of Christian ideal ism is not to be found in history, but in psychology. Instead of being a clarion call to faith to investigate for itself, spiritism be longs to that lower order that requires "mere works". By discovering for us rather than by letting us discover for ourselves, it weakens all our soul powers. It stunts us because it denies our noblest aspiration. Examined as a practical doctrine to assist us in living, spiritism would tend to make us less, not more, spiritual human beings. As a creed to energise us in our relations to this world, it is</page><page sequence="5">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 87 weak; as a creed to fortify us in our relations to another, is it any more vital? If it does not help us to meet life, does it help us to meet death, our own or our loved ones'? It was as a panacea in universal bereavement that psychic research attained its present popularity, and yet one dares to insist that spiritism is no more a spiritual way of regarding death than it is a spiritual way of facing life. For the man seeking to sift for himself the purport to him self of psychic science, the most illuminating method of procedure is to admit the hypothesis that its evidence is true, but to scrutin ise the effect claimed for this evidence. Granted that we can freely communicate with our dead, is the manner of conversation through the frankly occult means of ouija, mediums or automatic writing the surest solace for grief? If one accepts the testimony of spirit messages at their face value, and examines them in the light of this acceptance, what conclusions are to be drawn by an unbiased mind? The first is that we seem to be subjecting our loved ones to an intense difficulty in mere means of speech; it ap pears to be terribly hard for them to reach us. They seem to be feeling, often with real pain, for the old shackles of language, for the old physical restrictions that alone make possible an inter change of ideas with us who are still held by those restrictions. If it troubles our dead to talk to us, why should we ask it? Ac cording to spiritist records, our dead send reports of a busy, happy, emancipated activity. When we summon them, we in terrupt their own high services, deter them from starry climbs. All that the departed seem allowed to transmit to us is that they persist, with personality accentuated rather than weakened, and that they are joyously occupied,?as to anything more than this, the accounts of post-mundane existence are so contradictory as to be impossible even for spiritists themselves to disentangle. That our dead are alive and happy, all of us who accept Christianity with any sincerity believed this before. Many who did not ac cept Christian revelation were at least open to a faith in im mortality through observation of earthly lives so miraculously disciplined toward perfection that it seemed impossible to con ceive the universe so prodigal that it would devote so much energy to making a man beautiful only to snuff him out like a</page><page sequence="6">m THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW candle! People who have had enough religion of any kind to believe in the immortality of the soul will strengthen their faith best by reference to the testimony of their own souls rather than to material evidence. And how many people who did not believe in immortality have been converted by spiritist evidence? Again, still taking psychic messages at their face value, we gather that the dead desire of us a serenity so poised that they need not stop to worry about us, and an energy for righteousness in our physical sphere so vigorous that it shall be to them our strongest assurance of sympathy with their own activity. The firmest earthly bond between any two people is shared service; why should it not also be the most vital method of communion between the living and the dead? This conception of grief is exactly what Christianity has been teaching for two thousand years. The Christian attitude toward immortality is more vitalising than the spiritist because it demands the expression of this faith in action, it is inexorable in its insistence that the truest reverence for our dear ones is shown in incorporating their beauty into our own lives. Surely that is the highest tribute that one can ever pay to a loved one, and if our dead have indeed that surer vision which spirit messages affirm, they would value most that affection which imitates their earthly nobility. They must surely see, if they are capable of seeing anything, that pre occupation with mediumistic messages undermines the energy, which, expressed in service to the living, is the sole healthy cura tive of sorrow. If spiritist messages really establish, as they appear to do, a sphere of joyous activity for the departed, and another sphere of activity, less lucid, but as necessary, for us, both forms of activity having the same ultimate purpose, the spiritualising of humanity, then the surest way of feeling near our dead here, and the surest way of educating ourselves to join them there, seems to be to live while we live, rather than to try to penetrate the Great Divide. Spiritist accounts of the universe seem to show that the work beyond and the work here require the individual attention of each soul. Neither those others, nor we, have energy enough for both sides of the grave. One is speaking of course of the capacities of the average soul, physical or disembodied, and on the assumption that one accepts</page><page sequence="7">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 89 the evidences of spiritism while objecting to its inferences; arguing from and not against psychic phenomena, one may admit that the possibility of communication may legitimately engage special ists on both sides of death. Certain beings may well be selected by equipment and desire, like specialists in any other department of science. But just as on this planet progress would be inter rupted if everybody went into biology or mathematics, so the great work of this interwoven universe would surely be retarded if everybody went into the subject of post-mortal intercourse. At its best, communication between the living and the dead would be merely a means not an end. Psychic research has been digni fied to an undue importance. Unless messages from the dead make us better, they have no justification, and it is a question whether they have the power to make us better unless we possess that spiritual endowment and discipline that could make us better anyway, if we let it. Surely the highest regard we can show our dead is to trust rather than to trouble them. When the dead speak they seem to do so with difficulty, under the stress of patient pity. Even when the utterance is spontaneous, it always appears to be in the nature of an affectionate interruption to higher claims, as if they returned to help us when we can't help ourselves, but would really rather be about some beautiful business that forever draws them. Can we not suffer them to go to this high service? Has human love sunk to such pitiful selfishness that it would deter our dead from their transcendent occupations? Even suppose they faded into extinction, is there nowhere in us a nobility that would be glad we had possessed them even for a little while, and that could create for ourselves an indissoluble inspiration, forbidding us to mar that holy lost companionship by self-engrossed mourn ing? Instead of going to some trained medium to beg our dead child to speak to us, might it not be one's highest aspiration to say: My son has passed into nothingness, even as I myself shall presently pass, but meanwhile I will create within myself that divinity which shall cause me to walk godlike while I may, be cause for a little while I possessed him in his beauty. Yet few of us are strained to such high but tragic effort, for communion with our dead is not forbidden us even if we refuse</page><page sequence="8">90 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW any occult intercourse. We do not deny ourselves the conscious ness of an inter-related universe. There are moments when our dead seem strangely near, but, significantly, these moments come unsought. They are the moments when we are most courage ously attacking our problems with our own spiritual strength. This sense of unseen presences is too deep, too absolute, to need the impertinence of alien mediums, or of automatic writing. No matter how completely we are convinced of the juxtaposition of two worlds, our attitude is sanest if we decide not to penetrate too soon that other temple ordained for our pilgrimage. If by chance we do intercept some wireless message from beyond, it is best to attach it instantly to conduct, not to contemplation. We may sometimes rejoice in the happy confidence and assurance of definite personalities seeking to touch us, but we shall be in deeper accord with the purpose of their life if we neither desert our own posts nor recall our loved travelers from their starry journeying. If psychic research does not provide the noblest solace for the death of our loved ones, does it at least make our own dying easier? On the surface that would seem to be its chief excuse for being. Ripping the veil from before life's exit is supposed to make our going less painful. To think so is to exhibit once again the fallibility of spiritism, its ignorance of human nature. We would enter upon death more bravely if we knew what is there? Hardly, if what is there is what psychic research reveals! Death has been the one holy land secure from the desecration of human discovery. It has been the only adventure that could not be stolen from any human creature. As we look back at our lives we know that it has always been mystery that exhilarated us, it has been certainty that turned us craven with ennui. No, studying the geography of No-man's-land will not make us "bolder men in death", for to make death banal is to deny our soul-powers, inured to risking the desperate splendid chances of life. The elaborate detail to which spiritism reduces the New Heaven is for most of us an ugly substitute either for mystery or for nothingness. A somewhat sublimated repetition of existence here, is that all? We have a right to expect better things of</page><page sequence="9">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 91 death than that. Extinction would be more dignified, more in accord with the sublimity we have witnessed in heroic earthly lives. Spiritist pictures of life beyond the grave must affect people in two different ways; those to whom life is a disappointment will be enervated by a lotus-eating contemplation, those to whom life is a challenge will be revolted. There remains, of course, that number to whom psychic research will never mean anything at all. The history of thought, the history of religion, the history of the attitude of the living toward the dead, all repeat themselves in a way to make one a little hesitant about proclaiming that there is anything novel in scrutinising the other side of the grave. Other periods have occupied themselves with the life beyond,? to their own peril, and to the detriment of after generations. Other men in other times have conceived ghostly cities. It is no new pastime to build a heaven out of spirit-blocks so that we may hide earth from our eyes, but every age that has achieved growth has put away these childish things. All those other heavens were anthropomorphic, too, and reflected contemporary thought and feeling as transparently as does the spiritist heaven of today. It is true that our methods of approaching the other side are scientific rather than ecclesiastic, because ours is a scientific age. The after life that these scientific methods lay bare, how ever, is as clear a reflection of contemporary mental and spiritual development as was Virgil's or Dante's. In fact if one wanted to study the successive eras of history, one might easily do so by confining one's research to the successive pictures that earth has made of heaven. And no age and no man whose pictures of heaven have been more vivid than the realities of earth has ever pushed the human race far upon its way. For the security of our evolution, better the grossest mate rialism than that gazing upon the life to be should beguile our strength from living the life that is. Many thoughtful people are mystified by the present popularity of the psycfiic:?here is the explanation stated by a spiritist, who, a sincere Christian minister of today, is unconscious that he has reverted to the medievalism of yesterday; he thus explains the popular pre occupation :</page><page sequence="10">92 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW It proceeds, I think, from a wave of intense dissatisfaction with this present world. If there is a better world we want to be assured of it, and to be assured of it quickly. For minds seeking a firm basis on which to stand, there is none in sight. And therefore are we to turn to the contemplation of a post mundane order and security, because we abandon the effort to discover security in the world in which we are placed? Because our own souls are discouraged and impatient, are we to turn to souls passed on, to comfort and bolster us? Is that the road to spiritualised vision, to spiritualised effort? The medieval monks, aghast at the ugliness of the real world, made for their imaginations a celestial city built out of their own restricted aspirations, their own restricted notions of right and beauty, and in their tranced meditation on their own heaven, they rested. What energy did they have left to rebuild and re deem the tormented real world beyond the monastery gates? By way of escape from life they lived in contemplation of death. Exactly in the same way do spiritists act today. There is a mysticism that vitalises and a mysticism that destroys. Mysti cism is a confidence in invisible beauty. A cowardly mysticism can find invisible beauty only in an existence freed from the ugliness of the physical; a courageous mysticism finds beauty here and now, and seeks to embody it. We earn the right to ful ness of life beyond the grave only by practicing fulness of life here. The boasted new science is more medieval than it dreams. Not only is it lost in gazing at its self-created heaven, but it is subtly self-centred. We scorn the ethics of the hermit who was intent upon the saving of his own soul from the world. The monk in his monastery, the nun in her convent, were at peace while robbers raided the countryside, and fire and murder and rapine wrought a hell for other lives. Today we are told in book after book that spiritism has brought the writer serenity. Serenity? But how about activity? . Or service? Or ringing denunciation? Now, while famine and cruelty and greed walk the earth? No wonder that some of us see in spiritism a desperate peril. Today of all days, an instinct that would safeguard human growth makes us cry out to spiritists,?oh, turn from dreaming, and save a civilization that goes reeling!</page><page sequence="11">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 93 The dead are speaking to us? Well, let them! If listening to them means that we are deaf to one starving baby's cry, let them speak unheeded! There is no healing for a broken world in any teaching that exalts death at the expense of life. Spiritism asks us to give thought to our own dying?today of all days! It pleads: See how comfortable you will be in death and afterwards! What man worthy his heirship of life troubles himself about his dying? What man with red blood in him would not reply to the pleasant promises of spiritism. Let my death be like a gnat's if by extinction I may save one young life from the bestiality of war! It is beneath the dignity of the live soul to demand material proof of survival; it takes from us our right to be intrepid. We crave the opportunity to prove our faith in the loveliness of life victorious over all ugly seeming. We demand our right to em body that faith in service without being insulted by promises of ease beyond the grave. We allow no one to steal from us our awe of death. Life here is one temple, life there is another, and it is hideous to desecrate its threshold by material certainties. Why, one can imagine the descriptions in Raymond put into a movie scenario! My whole soul shrinks at this vulgarising of death. The august spirit that inhabits our body, has its right to an august destiny. Certainty is an affront, a sorry conclusion of that adventure into mystery to which this world has habituated us. Earth has honored the imperial soul that possesses us by allowing us to follow dauntlessly the quest of beauty amid darkness and despair. After that high privilege must we shrink to the pettiness of knowl edge, the sordidness of certainty? The human soul is mysterious and has a right to its exit into a mystery worthy the intrepid trust, which freely permitted us in this world, is still the soul's supreme prerogative in the world to come. One strange thing about this bewildered and bewildering period is that one meets religion in unexpected spots. People are not half so ashamed of God as they used to be; every little while one is startled by a confession of faith breaking out abruptly in a parliament or at a commercial convention or a lawyers' luncheon. Amid so much in the daily news that is heartless or avaricious or</page><page sequence="12">94 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW lawless or murder-mad, every little while appear these sudden flashes of a burning insight and a fiery zeal. Faith is not dead, but it is appearing in strange places, in editorials, in fiction, "The history of the human soul and its relation to divinity is the only history worth any man's pursuit,?" it is surely significant that these unabashed words are found in a popular present-day novel, Hugh Walpole's Secret City. People are trying to get at God in a manner that is often fumbling, but surprisingly candid, so that to day one need offer no apology for concluding a challenge of spirit ism with a study of its relation to religion. If faith is the power to perceive the substance of things not seen, then, clearly, when spirits are materialised for us and photographed and their surroundings pictorially reported and vouched for, we need no longer exercise a spiritualised imagina tion about them, and are denied any opportunity to trust God as to their welfare. Faith and material proof are a contradiction in terms. They cannot possibly exist together. Faith results from the slow education of the divine inside of us to recognise the divine outside of us. Being essentially a spiritual activity, faith cannot be strengthened by material evidences, for to depend on these would be to abrogate its own functions. The salient weakness of spiritism is its materialism. Its spirituality is fallacious. Psychic research, instead of introducing into our be wildered physical existence the clarity and nobility of the spirit world, on the contrary, introduces our own material standards, our finite valuations, our ephemeral desires, into the spirit world. Psychic research by invading mystery does not make earth spiritual, it makes heaven material. The medieval monk established in his heaven a hierarchy quite as specific as the ac tual hierarchy of church and state familiar to him,?is psychic re search any less naive in establishing in its after-world that order which current taste thinks beautiful and desirable? Even grant ing that every description which spirits give us of their life is au thentic, still, since they are forced in communicating to employ terms fitted for our life, their accounts must necessarily be grossly materialistic. If psychic research so cripples the exercise of our spiritual sight that we require the evidences of our eyes and ears before we are willing to believe in the existence of our dead, by</page><page sequence="13">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 95 so doing it will cripple our faculty for perceiving an invisible God. Faith must be founded on something sturdier than spirit contacts. If life and death are alike designed, through a tortu ous evolution, to develop the divine out of the human, then spiritism is in its very essence opposed to spirituality. Material ist proofs of God and our immortality are the stifling of the highest faculty we possess. Certainty forbids education through faith. Training in faith comes through acceptance of the physical as purposely ordained. Faith is attained through the search for God in matter,?in the twisted tortured flesh, in the brave, pitiful complexities of human conduct, in the sacred energies of the physical earth, in the authentic scripture of the pushing spring, in the holiness of small daily usages,?those homely shining pres ences that haunt the tea-kettle,?in those blind titanic struggles that scourge the nations through blood to progress. To miss seeing God in His physical world, who can tell whether it might not mean missing Him also in His world to come? Psychic research, with its preoccupation with physical evidence for a post-physical existence, is merely a harmless science, it is only as a religion that it is harmful. It is as superstitious to fear that faith could be destroyed by any scientific discovery as it is superficial to expect that it could be automatically assisted by any scientific discovery. People were afraid about faith when the principles of evolution were first announced, and yet evolution merely revealed a new aspect of God's mind, for evolution did not deny our divine creation, it merely emphasized the transcendent patience needed to bring forth a man from the void. To say that man was not made in a day was not to say that God did not make him; to say that the divine imprint is so sacred that it takes aeons to effect it is not to say that the man is not made in God's image. The discovery of evolution did not destroy faith for any except those who were rather relieved to put God out of court. For those whose faith was established, evolution merely meant a quickened reverence. That sin of spiritism which live people most resent is its failure to recognise the majesty of earth. Why are we created physical and planted in a physical world if we are to run away and expend</page><page sequence="14">96 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW all our thought on a psychical one? What contempt for the body, whose smallest cell is evidence to the divine structure of the temple of the soul! What neglect of the senses, given us as a means to discover the beauty of a world lent us for our joy and our education! To disregard the witness of our senses to the glory of the physical world is to bar ordained avenues of reverence. And must we fly to the spirit-world to find companions who shall inspire us? Noble souls are all about us,?if we do not see them, it is because we have not trained our physical sympathies to recognise spiritual beauty prisoned in flesh. We shall be fitter companions for the souls that inhabit heaven, if we have quick ened our vision to discover the aspirant flesh-bound souls who inhabit earth. To become absorbed in the activities of emanci pated spirits is to be dull to the intrepid efforts of the thousands who toil in blindness and dark to build the architecture of prog ress, it is to deny the dignity of those here striving to make the world a nobler dwelling for man's soul, a worthier footstool for his God. We are here not as unwilling slaves to circumstance, but as people who accept a gage from God, and submit to the laws of the game. We are put here to find out as much as we can about this earth ourselves, and God. When we call on spirits to help our spirit in its search, we are refusing both our duty and our privilege. The parable supreme to show the relation of man to man is that of the Good Samaritan, but the Good Samaritan obeyed his own conscience; if he had merely obeyed a ghost, would his example inspire us? The parable supreme to show the relation of man to God is that of the Prodigal Son, but the Prodigal Son obeyed his own conscience; if he had merely obeyed a ghost would he have won sure communion with his Father? This present world is too majestic a temple to abandon for psychic contemplation. One world at a time is the law of the spirit's progress. We were not meant to telescope the courses in our eternal education. It is possible that in occupying ourselves with our psychic faculties before the due time we may neglect the most important foundation for their development. It is possible that arrived in that new world, we may look back with regret to neglected studies, to exactly that strengthening of perception and</page><page sequence="15">SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SPIRITISM 97 energy which is appointed to accrue from our opportunities to spiritualise ourselves here. The effort to live in two worlds at once dissipates our energies and stunts our development for either plane. Psychic research has no reverence for the divinity appointed to the physical. Flesh and blood are imprinted with God's image; why must spirit photography summon faces out of ether in order that we should recognise God's artistry and go forth joyous to service? Why need we undergo the difficulties of psychic com munication in order to ascertain that grass grows in the world beyond? The grass at our own doorsteps is divine enough. Through our physical handicap we are purposely blinded to the full import of the universe, that we may discover it through trust, that slowly we may enter into the knowledge of the divine. The blindered horse, the hooded falcon, are justified in existence in so far as they submit to the master's clear vision and directing hand; our confidence that we serve some purpose beyond our comprehension is faith. To vulgarise death by certainties is to vulgarise life, to take away our highest privilege, that of discover ing God in the clay, and by our efforts thus illumined to help God create man out of dust. Spiritism contributes nothing to a faith so strong that to some it shall seem audacity to demand personal survival in addition to the priceless privilege of helping to evolve a beautiful thing. Only by constant reference to our own insight, by constant putting our own energies to the test of conduct, do we become not faithless but believing; we shall not be worthy of our immortality until we learn to trust God so joyously that we should be willing to accept even extinction at His hands.
