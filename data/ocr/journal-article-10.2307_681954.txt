The investigation focuses on how resources were mobilized and how plants and peoples were depicted and understood.

Mitchell, Nicholas S. Thompson, and H. Lyn Miles, editors This is the first book to evaluate the signifi- cance and usefulness of the practices of anthropo- morphism and anecdotalism for understanding animals. Diverse perspectives are presented in thoughtful, critical essays by histonans, philoso- phers, anthropologists, psychologists, behavionsts, biologists, primatologists, and ethologists. The nature of anthropomorphism and anecdotal analy- sis is examined; social, cultural, and historical attitudes toward them are presented; and scientific attitudes are appraised. Authors provide fascinat- ing in-depth descnptions and analyses of diverse species of animals, including octopi, great apes, monkeys, dogs, sea lions, and, of course, human beings. Concerns about, and proposals for, evalu- ations of a variety of psychological aspects of animals are discussed, including mental state attribution, intentionality, cognition, conscious- ness, self-consciousness, and language. "The topic is very significant, both because of the controversy in H1elds that are devoted to explaining animal behavior and because of the wide-ranging ramifications going beyond ani- mal mentality to the question of how we understand human behavior and mentality. Thus, I think it is also relevant to philosophy of mind which, until recently, treated as penpheral the ques- tion of animal mentality." - John Andrew Fisher, University of Colorado, Boulder 384 pages a $21.95 paperback ISBN 0-7914-3126-6 State University OF New York Press C/O CUP SERVICES PO BOX 6525 * ITHACA, NY 14851 1-800-688-2877 (FAX) PLEASE INCLUDE $3.50 SHIPPING</page><page sequence="3">i -Bl flqn 1 | Nationalism and the Geneabogical Imagination Oral History and Textual Authority in Tribal Jordan Andrew Shryock 'As important for the understanding of historiography and national identity in the contemporary Middle East as was Benedict Anderson 's discussion of 'print capitalism' for the emergence of national identities in early modern Europe."

Adams Technology is perhaps the most salient feature of our time, yet it ranks among the most unpredictable facets of human life. Here Robert McC. Adams, renowned anthropologist and Secretary Emeritus of the Smithsonian Institution, builds a new approach to understanding the circumstances that drive technological change, stressing its episodic, irregular nature. The result is a sweeping his- tory of technological transformation from ancient times to the pre- sent day. "This splendid book reflects Robert Adams's rare combination of training, experience, and insight: as scientist, anthropologist, Secretary of the Smithsonian, and wise observer of the changing scene worldwide. Paths of Fire allows us to see the implications for public policy today of the evolution of Western technology." -William G. Bowen, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Cloth: $29.95 ISBN 0-691-02634-3 Parents and Siblings of the Chronically 111 Child Myra Bluebond-Langner What is it like to live with a child who has a chronic, life-threat- ening disease? What impact does the illness have on well siblings in the family? In The Private Worlds of Dying Children, Myra Bluebond- Langner's previous book, now considered a classic in the field, she explored the world of terminally ill children. In her new book, she turns her attention to the lives of those who live in the shadow of chronic illness: the parents and well siblings of children who have cystic fibrosis. As family members talk about their experiences in their own words, we see how parents, well siblings, and the ill children them- selves struggle, in different ways, to contain the intrusion of the disease into their lives. This is an insightful examination of a subject that has not previously received sufficient attention from scholars. Cloth: $29.95 ISBN 0-691-02783-8 A Life-History Perspective Edited by Mary Ellen Morbeck, Alison Galloway, and Adrienne L. Zihiman A human female is born, lives her life, and dies within the space of a few decades, but the shape of her life has been strongly influenced by 50 million years of primate evolution and more than 100 million years of mammalian evolution. How the individual female plays out the stages of her life from infancy, through the reproductive period, to old age and how these stages have been formed by a long evolutionary process, is the theme of this collection. Written by leading scholars in fields ranging from evolution- ary biology to cultural anthropology, these essays together examine what it means to be female, integrating the life histo- ries of marine mammals, monkeys, apes, and humans.

Cohn Bernard Cohn's interest in the construction of Empire as an intellectual and cultural phenomenon has set the agenda for the academic study of modern Indian culture for over two decades. This collection of his writings over the last fifteen years discusses areas in which the colonial impact has generally been overlooked. The essays form a multifaceted exploration of the ways in which the British discovery, collection, and codifica- tion of information about Indian society contributed to colonial cultural hegemony and political control.
