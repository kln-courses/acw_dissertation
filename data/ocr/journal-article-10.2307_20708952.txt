<plain_text><page sequence="1">Platonists, Poets, and the God s-Eye View: Reading Santayanas "On the Death of a Metaphysician5 DOUGLAS MCDERMID Trent University Let us add that there is an old quarrel between philosophy and poetry. ?Plato1 We cannot rise above ourselves unless a superior power raise us. ?St. Bonaventure2 Not finitude, but the denial of finitude, is the mark of tragedy. ?Stanley Cavell3 .o Introduction: Philosophy and Poetry am no exception. Like many another philosopher with "an appetite for poetry,"4 I am keenly aware of the ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry?a quarrel grown old, we are told, by Plato's day?and Socrates' most caustic remarks about poetry s interpreters leave me feeling stung and vaguely ashamed.5 Thus it is with a double dose of anxiety and trepidation (if not with actual fear and trembling) that I propose here not only to analyze a poem but also to present it as a provocative indictment of Platonism and the Platonist critique of poetry. Lest my efforts be misconstrued, let me be absolutely clear about two things before we get underway. First, this article is not intended as a contribution to Plato scholarship. Although I shall discuss certain aspects of Plato's philosophi cal oudook, I leave painstakingly detailed examinations of specific passages and arguments to the specialist; they form no part of my present project. Second, although part of my article is given over to the analysis of a poem, the article as a whole is not a work of "mere" literary criticism (as opposed to philosophy), for the textual analysis I offer here is a necessary part?but only a part?of a larger metaphilosophical project: that of refining our understanding of the distinction(s) between philosophy and poetry. In the following pages, then, my goal is to articulate and explore one way?a nuanced and underappreciated THE PLURALIST Volume 3, Number 3 Fall 2008 : pp. 132-153 ?2008 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 132</page><page sequence="2">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets y and the God's-Eye View 133 way?of viewing the ancient quarrel of which Socrates speaks. That this way is expressed in poetic form means we must proceed differently than we would ifit were expounded discursively in, say, a treatise or an essay; but such diiferences should not be allowed to obscure the distinctively philosophical dimension of our project, which is made fully explicit in the latter half of the paper. And with that solemn apologia behind us, we are poised to begin. 1.1 Santayanas "On the Death of a Metaphysician" Entitled "On the Death of a Metaphysician," the poem I shall discuss was penned by George Santayana, a poet-philosopher (or philosopher-poet, de pending on your point of view) whose subtle meditations on poetry and phi losophy have long excited interest.6 To the best of my knowledge, however, virtually nothing has been written about "On the Death of a Metaphysician," in which a pagan poet of classical antiquity recounts the dramatic demise of a philosopher.7 Here, without further ado, is Santayanas poem: Unhappy dreamer, who outwinged in flight The pleasant region of the things I love, And soared beyond the sunshine, and above The golden cornfields and the dear and bright Warmth of the hearth,?blasphemer of delight, Was your proud bosom not at peace with Jove, That you sought, thankless for his guarded grove, The empty horror of abysmal night? Ah, the thin air is cold above the moon! I stood and saw you fall, befooled in death, As, in your numb?d spirit's fatal swoon, You cried you were a god, or were to be; I heard with feeble moan your boastful breath Bubble from depths of the Icarian sea.8 In this article I shall try to do something like justice to "On the Death of a Metaphysician" by offering a philosophically informed reading of this over looked and (as I think) brilliant creation of Santayanas. My principal con tentions are five; namely, that . Santayanas poet-narrator inveighs against the Weltbild embedded in the Platonist s invidious contrast between appearance and reality (construed as mutually exclusive realms of being);9 2. the poets assault on Plato's dualism between appearance and real ity proceeds via a subversive reinterpretation of that dualism's most influential expression, namely, the Allegory of the Cave;</page><page sequence="3">134 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 3. the poem illuminates the quarrel between philosophy and poetry from an unusual angle, for it shows us how the Platonist looks from the perspective of the poet (instead of vice versa, as in the Republic); 4. in addition to sharpening the distinction between Platonist and poet, the poem helps us see why the Platonist's critique of mimetic art in the Republic is a failure from the poet's standpoint; and, finally, 5. the ancient poet s opposition to the spirit of Platonism is relevant to contemporary philosophy, for his stance can plausibly be reinter preted in the form of various doctrines (epistemological, metaphysi cal, and ethical) that still claim adherents. 1.2 Structure My article can be divided into two roughly equal halves, each of which com prises two sections. In the first half, I begin with a preliminary discussion of Plato s Allegory of the Cave (section 2) and then explore three ways in which Santayanas sonnet can be read as a sustained critical commentary on that al legory (section 3). Building on its first interpretative half, the papers second and more philosophical half explores the ways in which "On the Death of a Metaphysician" enhances our understanding of the poetry-philosophy distinc tion. Here I play off the sensibilities of the poet-narrator and the metaphysi cian and then explain how Santayanas poet attempts to counter Plato's attack on mimesis (section 4). Finally, I consider how the anti-Platonist sensibility of the poet-narrator might be translated into the idiom of contemporary philosophy, with a special focus on epistemology (section 5). 2.0 Plato Revisited Since it would be a risible understatement to say that the Allegory of the Cave is well-known, I shall provide only the most schematic outline of it (2.1),10 after which I shall sketch an interpretation of its content (2.2) and its form (2.3). Though some of this material will undoubtedly be familiar to the reader, its inclusion here is absolutely necessary, for it sets the stage for the reading of "On the Death of a Metaphysician" articulated in section 3. 2.1 The Allegory of the Cave In Book VII of the Republic, Socrates asks his interlocutors to imagine a dark subterranean cavern in which human beings are imprisoned and shackled (514a). Behind them is a high wall or platform with a fire, and between the</page><page sequence="4">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets, and the Gods-Eye View 135 fire and the prisoners there are people carrying iconic artefacts or statues whose shadows are projected onto the front wall of the cave (5140-5140). Us ing this curious mise-en-sc?ne, Socrates tells a story which we may divide into five stages. (1) From where the prisoners are seated, they can see only shadows dimly flickering on the wall of the cave in front of them. These they regard not as shadows or illusions but as real things, for such appearances are all they have ever known. Indeed, we are told that the prisoners cannot see themselves or each other (5^-5150). Suppose, next, that (2) one of the prisoners is released and stands up. Turning around, he faces the fire and is temporarily blinded by its brightness. When he recovers his sight, he has been disillusioned?and yet he still cannot completely assimilate the fact that the shadows on the wall are illusions or insubstantial projections (515c). Suppose, however, that (3) our liberated prisoner is compelled to leave the cave and ascend to the sunlit world above it. Here, too, the former cave-dweller will initially be disoriented and confused by the light. Gradually, though, his eyes will grow accustomed to the glare and he will be able to see shadows, followed by images, objects, and the sky and the moon (5i6a-5i6b). Finally, (4) he will be ready to gaze directly at the sun, the source of all that exists (5i6b-5i6c). This luminous vision completes his disillusionment; and now that he has beheld the sun, he pities the prisoners trapped below in obscurity (516c). If, however, (5) he should return to the cave, he will inevitably suffer at the hands of the very people he seeks to enlighten. Since his eyes can no longer compete in acuity with those of more seasoned shadow-spotters, the prisoners will mock him and conclude his upward journey has destroyed his sight. Moreover, they will kill him should he attempt to "liberate" them, that is, persuade them to forsake the passive comforts of the cave for the exacting glory of the upper world (5i6e-5i7a). How, now, is this Allegory?which Schopenhauer deemed the most im portant passage in all of Plato?to be understood?11 2.2 From Appearance to Reality According to Socrates, the cave of stage (1) symbolizes the world of particu lars in perpetual flux apprehended by the senses (517b); it is all that the vast majority of us ever know, and it is that by which?or so Plato thinks?all but the true philosopher remain trapped or imprisoned. Yet if the subterranean cave is a prison, it is also a womb: a dark, enclosed space whose immature occupants are not self-sufficient and cannot yet perceive themselves or a fully objective world. Accordingly, the painful emergence from the shadowy cave</page><page sequence="5">36 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 into the bright upper world of stages (3) and (4) can be seen as a kind of birth: a birth in which reason?freed from a constricting space that hinders its further development?is released into a world for which it is (partially) prepared. This is the immutable world of the supersensible Forms or Ideas: universal absolutes or archetypes, the highest of which is the Good?"the cause for all things of all that is right and beautiful" (517c)?encountered as the sun in stage (4). Because the Allegory of the Cave is structured around a set of parallel dichotomies, the philosopher s ascent leads him simultaneously from appear ance to reality, from bondage to freedom, from vulgar opinion to genuine knowledge, from turbulent flux to serene immutability, from confused sensa tion to pure thought, from the particular to the universal, from contingency to necessity, and?last but not least?from viewing the world through a per spective conditioned by one s time and place to surveying reality objectively or sub specie aeternitatis. There is a sense, therefore, in which the philosopher s odyssey is not one journey but many. Nevertheless, in each case the thematic progression is the same: something allegedly imperfect in epistemological or ontological terms?that is, some inferior form of consciousness or mode of being?is transcended and yields to its ideal counterpart. 2.3 The Comic Dimension of the Allegory Having touched on the Allegory's content, let us briefly consider its narrative form or shape. Here Socrates is silent, but we do not need his help to see that his tale exhibits the tripartite structure of the so-called "monomyth": an archetypal myth in which " [a] hero ventures forth from the world of com mon day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man" (Campbell 30).12 In Plato's Allegory, the philosopher passes from the cave of ordinary experience?in other words, "the world of common day"?into the upper world of ideal Forms inaccessible to the senses; that is, "a region of supernatural wonder." After a painful adjustment to his new surroundings, he wins his "decisive victory"?a victory over ignorance and confusion, that is?when he is vouchsafed a vision of the Good. Enlightened, the philosopher returns to the cave in order to aid or "bestow boons" on the prisoners (whose suspicion and ill-will are neatly explained by the Allegory). All three stages of the monomyth are thus represented: departure (stages 2 and 3), triumph (stage 4), and return (stage 5).</page><page sequence="6">mc de rm id : Platonists, Poets, and the Gods-Eye View 137 Viewing the Allegory as an instantiation of the monomyth helps us see that the adventures of the philosopher are not without precedent in Greek antiquity, for the Platonist actually follows in the footsteps of a much earlier hero: Odysseus. That there is a formal parallel here seems undeniable: like Odysseus, the philosopher goes on an arduous quest from which he returns transformed, only to be pilloried by those who cannot see him for what he is. Moreover, both quests are successful: just as Odysseus returns to Ithaca and sets his house in order, the philosopher-hero is rewarded by the sublime vision of the Good. Hence?and this is a crucial point, to which we shall return in section 3?the Allegory of the Cave, like the Odyssey, qualifies as a comedy inasmuch as the hero succeeds or triumphs. 3.0 Rewriting the Allegory Now that we have discussed both the form and the content of Plato's Al legory, we are finally in a position to appreciate three interrelated ways in which Santayana's "On the Death of a Metaphysician" subverts it. The first of these ways concerns genre (3.1); the second, imagery (3.2); and the third, the use of classical allusions (3.3). 3.1 Genre First, then, there is the matter of genre. Whereas Plato's Allegory is comic in the sense mentioned above (i.e., the hero achieves his main objective in stage [4]), "On the Death of a Metaphysician" is the story of a failed quest, of a tragically unsuccessful attempt to find knowledge or wisdom by venturing beyond the limits of the natural and the commonplace. Spurning the sunshine (3), the "golden cornfields" (4), and the "warmth of the hearth" (5), our ascetic metaphysician abandons "the pleasant region of the things I love" (2)?that is, the familiar world of human experience to which the poet is attached? and rises above it through flight (1). This daring attempt to transcend the realm of the everyday through abstract speculation leads not to philosophical enlightenment, however, but only to "the empty horror of abysmal night" (8) found in the void above the moon (9). Dazed and enfeebled by the "thin air" (9) of the superlunary realm, the philosopher becomes disoriented, loses his bearings in a "fatal swoon" (11), and plummets into "the Icarian sea" (14). And yet he is splendidly self-deluded and defiant to the very end, proclaim ing his kinship with divinity with "boastful breath" (13) at the moment of death: "You cried you were a god, or were to be" (12).</page><page sequence="7">138 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 Here we find no grand triumph or "decisive victory" to celebrate, only loss and folly and ruin to lament. Nor, strictly speaking, is there even a return to "the world of common day." For the earth the metaphysician spurned will not receive him now; it lets him fall to an unseen domain beneath its surface?"the depths of the Icarian sea" (14)?which is dark, cold, and dis tant. This is manifestly the stuff of tragedy: the overreaching hero fails, falls, and (literally) goes under, defeated and alone. 3.2 Imagery This shift from comedy to tragedy is achieved partly through a reversal or inversion of two sets of images central to the Allegory?namely, the contrasts between light and darkness and between ascent and descent. As we have seen, Plato asks us to imagine the realm of sensory phenomena as a subterranean place of shadows, to be sharply distinguished from the elevated and radiant space wherein the supersensible Forms are found. Accordingly, the Platonist s ascent from the dark cave to the resplendent upper world is a journey from in substantial simulacra toward a reality that is metaphysically basic or primordial. In Santayanas poem, however, light is confined to the world of ordinary expe rience?the world of "sunshine" (3), "golden cornfields" (4), and the hearths "dear and bright / warmth" (4-5)?whereas the upper world is dark, holding nothing but "the empty horror of abysmal night" (8). The implications of this inverted contrast are plain: if our world is a place of warmth and brightness as the poet insists (4-5), the philosophers flight from it?his attempt to soar "beyond the sunshine" (3)?is a movement away from illumination; his ascent "above the moon" (9) is a solitary journey into an obscure and barren void. By linking light with the earth and darkness with the supramundane, Santayanas poet can redescribe the Platonist s otherworldly quest as a futile journey from light into darkness and from life into death. But what, pre cisely, does that darkness represent in philosophical terms? Here we encounter some (artful) ambiguity on Santayanas part, because there are at least three philosophically interesting ways in which the phrase "the empty horror of abysmal night" (8) might be interpreted. The poet may think that (i) there is simply no transcendent or absolute reality behind appear ances (as in Nietzsches perspectivism)13 or (ii) there is such a reality but it lies beyond our ken, so that the nature of the noumenal remains impenetrably obscure (as in Kant's tran scendental idealism)14 or, finally (iii) there is a transcendent or in-itself reality but?unlike Plato's Form</page><page sequence="8">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets, and the God's-Eye View 139 of the Good?it is an unruly and irrational source of appalling suf fering and "horror" (8) (as in Schopenhauer's variation on Kant's transcendental idealism).15 Regardless of which horn of this trilemma we grasp?the Kantian, the Schopenhauerian, or the Nietzschean?the poet's basic anti-Platonist point is the same: the metaphysician's search for something over and above familiar phenomena is not an edifying pursuit but one profoundly inimical to human flourishing and well-being. 3.3 Classical Allusions From its initial mention of human flight (1) to its allusion to "the Icarian sea" (14), Santayana's sonnet invites us to compare the metaphysician with Icarus, who soared too high and fell into the sea after the sun's rays melted the wax on his artificial wings. Five parallels are especially salient: (a) First, there is the shared motif of escape in the form of flight. Read ers of Ovid's Metamorphoses will recall that Icarus is the son of the inventor Daedalus, who was held against his will by King Minos. Weary of Crete, the master artificer decides to leave it without the tyrant's permission: "Though he [Minos] may block escape by land and water ... yet the sky is open, and by that way I will go. Though Minos rules over all, he does not rule the air" (Metamorphoses Vili: 185-187). Similarly, the Platonist metaphysician is a captive in stages (1) and (2) of the Allegory, for he begins his odyssey as a shackled prisoner in the cave, from which he can only be freed by ascending to the upper world, "outwing[ing] in flight" (1) the region of the everyday. (b) Secondly, the hero is in exile, so the intended destination of his flight is his homeland or place of origin. Significantly, Ovid begins his ac count of Icarus' misadventures by reminding us that Daedalus, an Athenian, "hating Crete and his long exile, and longing to see his native land, was shut in by the sea" (Metamorphoses Vili: 183-185). Once again, there is a parallel with the "unhappy" (1) metaphysician, whose self-understanding is that of one dwelling in a realm?"the pleasant region" of sense (2)?he finds alien. A dualist who thinks of himself as essentially an immaterial soul or pure spirit, the Platonist "dreamer" (1) feels estranged from the outer world of gross matter? including his own body (Phaedo 64d-68c)?and identifies his home with the unearthly realm of the Forms grasped by pure thought.16 (c) Thirdly, the hero's tragic end results from a failure to live moderately</page><page sequence="9">140 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 within limits imposed by nature. The youthful Icarus dies because he does not heed Daedalus' injunction to pursue a "middle course" suit able for one in his situation: "I warn you, Icarus, to fly in a middle course, lest, if you go too low, the water may weight your wings; if you go too high, the fire may burn them. Fly between the two" (Meta morphoses Vili: 203-206). The philosopher, too, would have avoided disaster had he been content to keep his feet on terra firma, like the cave-dwellers in stage (i) of the Allegory; it is once he imprudently deserts the sphere natural to his kind, namely, the earth's surface, that he passes wildly from one extreme (the sky) to another (the ocean) in which he perishes. (d) Furthermore, the intemperate hero uses an instrument as an end in itself, instead of employing it as means to further purely human ends. Thus the artificial wings Daedalus fashions for himself and for Icarus are intended solely as a temporary means of conveyance. But Icarus forgets what his wings are for (i.e., a way to get from Crete to Athens) and exults in the intoxicating freedom of flight for its own sake. Some thing similar happens in the poem, where the doomed flight of the philosopher is apparently from the phenomenal world itself, and not between two places within it. Since on one level the metaphysician's wings symbolize reason, we encounter the quasi-Kantian suggestion that he is guilty of using that faculty for an end?speculation about the noumenal realm behind phenomena?for which it ultimately proves ill-suited.17 (e) Finally, the hero's unwillingness to acknowledge limitations which derive from human nature initiates a sequence of metamorphoses terminating in degeneration. In Ovid, this is clear: because of his father's skill, Icarus becomes a birdlike creature winging heavenward before falling into the sea, where he is buried beneath the waves like a fish. The same symbolic progression of transformations culminating in devolution?namely, from man to bird to fish?is evident in San tayana's poem. Both stories can therefore be read as cautionary tales about the paradoxical perils of unlawful aspirations, in which heroes become subhuman when they seek to become superhuman. As Santayanas poet sees it, then, the metaphysician and Icarus are both tragic figures whose wild flights reflect an immature refusal to accept the human condition. Santayana takes a further step, however, when he has his poet-narrator invoke Jove (6-7)?as if to accuse the Platonist not merely of arrogance or pride but of downright impiety. Though this accusation may seem heavy-handed to some, it makes perfect sense on two levels:</page><page sequence="10">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets, and the Gods-Eye View (a) To begin with, there is the level of Greco-Roman mythology, on which the philosopher offends Jove in at least two ways. First, the rationalist is an ascetic, or a "blasphemer of delight" (5); that is, his flight from nature exhibits an unseemly lack of gratitude (7) for the "pleasant region" (2) over which Jove?no stranger to sensual delight?presides. Second, Jove is the sky god; hence, the meta physician's decision to enter this region without securing the god's permission constitutes a form of trespassing or invasion. (b) Moreover, the charge of impiety can be defended on the plane of pure philosophy, using the well-known definition of piety Santayana advances in The Life of Reason: Piety, in its nobler and Roman sense, may be said to mean man's rev erent attachment to the sources of his being and the steadying of his life by that attachment. If we wish to live associated with permanent racial interests we must plant ourselves on a broad historic and human foundation, we must absorb and interpret the past which has made us, so that we may hand down its heritage reinforced, if possible, and in no way undermined or denaturalised. This consciousness that the hu man spirit is derived and responsible, that all its functions are heritages and trusts, involves a sentiment of gratitude and duty which we may call piety. (258)18 If Santayana's definition is correct?if, that is, piety is "man's reverent attachment to the sources of his being and the steadying of his life by that attachment" (Life of Reason 258)?then the poet is surely justified in regarding the detached metaphysician as impious (as well as unsteady). For the isolated and gravity-defying Platonist, animated by the vain hope of becoming "a god" (12), declares his independence from the things by which the poet is sustained: nature, human society, and the gods.19 3.4 Recapitulation From the foregoing (i.e., sections 2 and 3) we may conclude that "On the Death of a Metaphysician" rewrites Plato's Allegory of the Cave, casting the Platonist as a tragic hero whose solitary intellectual quest for a transcendent reality behind appearances is a form of hubristic overreaching. In the second half of the paper (sections 4 and 5), we shall explore the implications that Santayana's poem, so interpreted, has for philosophy. We begin by looking at the novel way in which the poem sharpens our sense of what distinguishes the Platonist from the poet.</page><page sequence="11">142 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 4.0 Poets Contra Platonists Although Platos opposition to poetry is powerfully declared in several dia logues, his best known treatment of the subject is arguably Book X of the Republic. Here we are told that poetry is a mimetic or imitative art; and that as such, its products are at "three removes from reality" (599a), since they represent appearances of an objective and intelligible reality (i.e., the Forms). The gist of the objection is straightforward: from the Platonist s standpoint, poetry is epistemologically and metaphysically suspect because it is confined to the deceptive and insubstantial sphere of mere appearance. Now, I submit that "On the Death of a Metaphysician" makes a notewor thy contribution to this debate between Platonists and poets, for the poem? itself a representation?presents the metaphysician from the perspective of the poet, who shows us the fate awaiting those who slight or slander "mere" appearances. The result of this perspectival shift is illuminating?or so I shall argue in this section, in which I do two things: first, contrast the sensibili ties of the poet-narrator and the metaphysician (4.1) and second, point out that the poem contains (albeit in embryonic form) a critique of Plato's case against mimesis (4.2). 4.1 Poetry as Piety, Platonism as Hubris? If piety consists in "a man's reverent attachment to the sources of his being" (Santayana, Life of Reason 258), Santayana's poet-narrator qualifies as intensely pious. Entranced by transitory appearances he loves (2) and faithfully records, he is wedded to the "pleasant region" (2) in which he is embedded?unlike the philosopher, that "unhappy dreamer" (1), who has withdrawn into his own mind and recoils from contact with sensible things. In contrast, the poet cel ebrates the sensuous and contingent: sunshine (3), golden cornfields (4), and the comforting warmth of the hearth (5).20 Persuaded that "the soul is not on earth an alien thing,"21 he is not estranged from nature, which he compares not to a prison but to a bright and sheltering "grove" (7) we owe to Jove. Moreover, since Jove (unlike the abstract Form of the Good) is an anthropomorphic nature deity with a popular cult and traditions,22 we can conclude that the poet's piety generously extends?in that fine Roman fashion Santayana so admired?not only to nature and the gods but also to customs and institutions tended and transmitted by his ancestors. Thoroughly at home in the world of shared human experience, San tayana's poet is opposed to that fierce and anxious intolerance of contingency</page><page sequence="12">mc derm id : Platonists, Poets, and the God's-Eye View 143 which informs what Richard Rorty has called "the Platonic urge to escape from the finitude of one's time and place" (Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism xix).23 It is this merciless urge that compels certain philosophers to dream of a "God's-Eye View" (H. Putnam 17) or "View from Nowhere" (Nagel), that is, some lofty Olympian perch above the fray of the everyday, from which we can compare our all-too-human representations to an objective standard to which we have unmediated access.24 Plato's Allegory of the Cave is, of course, the supreme example of the quest for such an Archimedean point or touchstone: the rationalist progressively detaches himself from the contingent conditions and structures (e.g., the peculiarities of his subjective constitu tion, his culture, etc.) that mediate and distort his apprehension of reality, until such limitations are removed and he directly beholds the Forms. Con templation of this immutable and unconditioned reality yields something immeasurably better and more noble than the transitory satisfactions of the cave?to wit, the ecstasy or liberating self-transcendence of objectivity. We might sum up this line of thought by saying that according to philoso phers who yield to the Platonic urge (be they Platonists in the strict sense or no), we must free ourselves from parochial attachments and let thought and conduct be constrained by a scheme of objective categories and norms which only philosophical reason can discover. Yet if we employ the honourary epithet of "Platonist" in this way, and reserve it for those who think that the God's-Eye View is both intelligible and indispensable, then the poet in "On the Death of a Metaphysician" must be numbered among the anti-Platonists?as, in their different ways, are Montaigne, Nietzsche, the later Wittgenstein, Oakeshott, Gadamer, and Rorty (to name only a few of the poet s more distinguished fellow travellers). From the poet's vantage point, the rationalist ideal of an immaculate God's-Eye View?a perspective uncoloured by subjectivity or sentiment, tradi tion or history?is profoundly at odds with our finitude and hence with our humanity. Indeed, the quest for such a view is represented as self-destructive, since the perfectly objective form of understanding the metaphysician seeks means uprooting or cutting oneself off from (what the poet takes to be) the very sources of one's being: nature, one's home and community, one's customs, and one's gods. The wages of (Platonist) objectivity, in short, are self-alienation and death?or so Santayana's poet intimates. 4.2 Of Metaphysicians and Mimesis Recall, moreover, that the Platonists attempt to break out of the sphere of appearances not only proves fatal, it also proves a pathetic failure. Instead of</page><page sequence="13">144 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 discovering the Archimedean point or touchstone he seeks, the metaphysician encounters nothing?literally?in the guise of "the empty horror of abysmal night" (8). In section 3.2 we identified three ways in which this sphinx-like phrase from the poem might be glossed. The essential thing, in the present context, is to note what the Kantian, Schopenhauerian and Nietzschean read ings have in common?namely, that each takes issue with some aspect of Plato s time-honoured distinction between appearance and reality. According to Kant, the reality behind appearances?the elusive Ding an sich, or thing in-itself?is epistemically inaccessible even to the rationalist metaphysician; according to Schopenhauer, the nature of the Kantian thing-in-itself is to be sought in the raw and chaotic irrationality of blind Will (a far cry, alas, from Plato's glorious Form of the Good); and according to Nietzsche, the very idea of a "true world" of pure being, in comparison with which our world of becoming, is second-rate, is a pernicious fiction. Let us now see where this may lead. TjfKant or Schopenhauer or Nietz sche is right, then there is something wrong with Plato's distinction between appearance and reality. But because that venerable distinction is the meta physical cornerstone of the Platonist critique of mimesis, skepticism about the former may be understood as skepticism about the latter?and, therefore, interpreted as a tacit affirmation of the pious poet's right to take appearances seriously. Moreover, since the self-justifying moral which the metaphysician's death encourages the poet to draw accords so well with Aristotle's attitude toward mimesis, it is tempting to read "On the Death of a Metaphysician" as expressing not merely opposition to the Republics high-flown vision, but support for the more down-to-earth framework found in the Poetics. So the poem may have a positive philosophical dimension as well as a negative or anti-Platonist one. Let us explore this idea further. 5.0 From Poetry to Philosophy: Santayanas Critique of "Pure" Reason Time and again we have contrasted the poet with the Platonist. But of course not all philosophers are Platonists?not even in an extended and honourary sense of that term. Since, then, the poet's opposition to Platonism cannot be equated with opposition to philosophy per se, we can ask how the poet's sensibility might be expressed in the medium of philosophy. In other words: if the poet were a philosopher, just what kind of philosopher would he be? What specific theses might he endorse or deny?</page><page sequence="14">MCDERMID : Platonistsy Poets, and the Gods-Eye View H5 5.1 A Quartet of Denials It is not hard, I think, to identify several Platonist-inspired doctrines whose otherworldly spirit clashes with the pious sensibility of the poet, as described in section 4.1. Here are four examples, the first of which is drawn from metaphys ics; the second, from ethics; and the third and fourth, from epistemology: (1) A dualist thesis, according to which a person is essentially an imma terial soul distinct from, but conjoined to, a material body in which he is imprisoned25 (2) A strong anti-hedonist thesis, according to which bodily or sensual pleasure is "low" or "base" and not a genuine good (3) A strong anti-empiricist and rationalist thesis, according to which sense perception is unreliable and reason alone can yield knowl edge (4) A metaphilosophical thesis, according to which philosophy is a purely a priori discipline charged with rationally grounding or debunking our contingent form of life by appealing to necessary structures (or "foundations") external to it26 If our poet were to turn philosopher, then, we could easily imagine him rejecting the above doctrines. However, I shall not speculate here about the specific form his denials of (1M4) might assume?except to point out that such denials (a) are now commonplace in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy; and (b) could take an Aristotelian form (though of course they need not do so). Instead, I choose to focus on a more positive and broadly anti-Platonist doctrine implicit in Santayana's poem, which Santayana him self later embraced qua epistemologist.27 Moreover, this doctrine?a form of naturalism?has a roster of eminent defenders, as we shall now see. 5.2 Scepticism, Naturalism, and Animal Faith The metaphysicians flight symbolizes the attempt to live by reason alone and to sever ones ties with nature, understood as a hindrance to reason. We know all too well, however, that our upwardly mobile rationalist cannot stay aloft for long; gravity is not to be mocked. What the Platonist s fall is sup posed to illustrate?or so we might plausibly surmise?is that the attempt to "purify" reason by isolating and emancipating it from the supposedly lower, bestial elements in human nature serves only to leave that faculty ruined and impotent. Santayanas poem may thus be read as saying that human reason,</page><page sequence="15">146 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 instead of standing in stark opposition to nature, is actually sustained by it; and that the proper function of reason is not to subjugate nature, but to acknowledge its authority and cooperate with it. One philosophical moral the poem would appear to articulate, then, is that human reason is fated to work within a framework whose outer contours or boundaries are imposed by nature in the form of brute, ineradicable commit ments. This stance consorts well with the naturalism championed by Hume, who maintained that although our fundamental convictions?that there is an external world, say, or that the future will resemble the past?cannot be ratio nally grounded or justified, such judgments cannot be abandoned, even by a committed sceptic. This is because such beliefs are not the work of Reason but of Nature, who "by an uncontroulable necessity has determine! us to judge as well as to breathe and to feel" (Hume, Treatise I.iv.i: 183). Though unanswerable, then, the sceptic s radical doubts about the existence of external objects are ut terly vain and idle. Indeed, even "the sceptic continues to reason and believe," because "Nature has not left this to his choice, and has doubtless esteem'd it an affair of too great importance to be trusted to our uncertain reasonings and speculations. We may well ask, What causes induce us to believe in the existence of body? but 'tis in vain to ask Whether there be body or noti That is a point, which we must take for granted in all our reasonings" (Hume, Treatise I.iv.ii: 187). The naturalism Hume endorsed has proved enduring; we find variations on its basic idea, for instance, in the later Wittgenstein and in P. F. Strawson.28 We can also discern an allegiance to a kindred position in Santayana's reflec tions on the indispensability of what he calls "animal faith."29 Anticipating and fully affirming what Wittgenstein was later to call the "groundlessness (Grundlosigkeit) of our believing" (?166),30 Santayana maintains that "belief in the existence of anything, including myself, is something radically incapable of proof, and resting, like all belief, on some irrational persuasion or prompt ing of life" (Scepticism and Animal Faith 35). As indemonstrable commitments which exert an enormous influence over our conduct, such beliefs qualify as a form of "faith" (at least in Santayana's sense of the term).31 What makes them "animal" is their origin in our nature or constitution: such convictions impose themselves upon us all with the sure and importunate irresistibility of instinct, making it practically impossible to doubt them. While aware that a mere appeal to animal faith is insufficient to refute scepticism (Santayana, Scepticism and Animal Faith 105),32 Santayana is of the opinion that a credible theory of knowledge cannot afford to ignore the exis tence of such unreasoned and ineradicable convictions; indeed, he holds that a philosophy that cannot bring itself to accept the manifest sovereignty of the</page><page sequence="16">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets, and the Gods-Eye View 147 natural in this area is nothing but a fatuous exercise in "make-believe" [Scepti cism and Animal Faith 186). In Scepticism and Animal Faith he writes, I am not concerned about make-believe philosophies, but about my actual beliefs. It is only out of his own mouth, or rather out of his own heart, that I should care to convince the sceptic. Scepticism, if it could be sincere, would be the best of philosophies. But I suspect that other sceptics, as well as I, always believe in substance, and that their denial of it is sheer sophistry and the weaving of verbal arguments in which their most familiar and massive convictions are ignored. (186) Accordingly, the Cartesian rationalist sceptic stands accused of an insin cerity and self-deception akin to bad faith: ignoring Peirce s sage advice?"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts" (Selected Papers 5. 2 5)33?the deluded sceptic refuses to acknowledge the contingent but inflexible limits nature puts on inquiry and speculation. San tayanas impatience with such pretence is palpable in the passage just cited, and his naturalistic philosophy of animal faith, like his poem, echoes the words Hume long ago put in Nature s mouth: "Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man" (Enquiry I: 9). 6.0 In Lieu of a Last Word: Disputed Questions and Conclusions If we allow that "On the Death of a Metaphysician" is a portrait of a phi losopher, we must immediately grant that it is more than this. Because the philosopher s portraitist is present in his work, the poem is also a representa tion of the poet?a "portrait of the artist as an anti-Platonist," as it were. But a portrait may lead us to ask questions it cannot answer; and so it is with the portraits that compose Santayanas poem. Whether the Platonist's quest for a God's-Eye View is utterly quixotic, whether the poet is best seen as an Ar istotelian or as an honorary pragmatist or as something else entirely, whether the Platonist would regard the poet's "piety" as a form of false consciousness anticipated by the Allegory, whether the poet would countenance Strawsonian "descriptive" (as opposed to "revisionary") metaphysics,34 whether Platonists or Aristotelians (or neither) are right about mimesis, and even whether San tayanas own philosophy is Platonist in spirit35?all these are complex issues we cannot possibly address, let alone answer, within the confines of the present article. Some will ponder a further question: namely, whether we can fully integrate or synthesize the one-sided insights of poet and Platonist?convert them, that is, into complementary and mutually reinforcing parts of a coher ent whole?without embracing a religious and sacramental vision of reality</page><page sequence="17">148 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 according to which?in the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins?"the world is charged with the grandeur of God."36 We cannot, I repeat, take up any of these questions here. Nevertheless, the very fact that "On the Death of a Metaphysician" invites us to pose them is a testament to its intellectual richness. In a mere fourteen lines, Santayana draws inventively on a wide variety of sources?including Ovid, Hume, and Kant? to change the aspect under which Plato and his footnotes are seen. In doing so, he connects philosophy's past with its future, for his sonnet, composed slightly more than a century ago, illuminates the grounds of philosophy's ancient quarrel with poetry while gesturing toward views many now find congenial. A poem that can accomplish all this, I submit, deserves a wider and more appreciative audience than "On the Death of a Metaphysician" has hitherto enjoyed.

Republic 607b. 2. The Journey of the Mind to God {Itinerarium mentis in Deum) 1.1; 5. 3. The CUim of Reason 455. 4. A term I borrow from Frank Kermode (26-27), who in turn borrows it from Paul Val?ry. 5. Cf. Republic 607b; Protagoras 3470348b. 6. The former view, according to which Santayana is not so much a philosopher as a sage and litterateur, is discernible in Passmore (287-290). But Sprigge (Santayana; "Santayana") makes a strong case for the latter view: convinced that Santayana "developed one of the most perfectly worked out complex philosophical systems there is," he takes exception to the suggestion that Santayana "was not really a systematic or analytical thinker, but more a belles lettres writer of beautiful philosophic aper?us" ("Santayana" 117). Some of his thoughts on poetry and philosophy can be found in Santayana ( The Sense of Beauty, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, Life of Reason, The Last Puritan, and "Apologia pro Mente Sua"). For a sample of critical opinion, see Rice, Ashmore, Levinson, Putnam and Putnam, and Singer. 7. "On the Death of a Metaphysician" is mentioned only in passing by Kirkwood (59) and Holzberger (Introduction 43), for instance; whereas Hughson does not discuss it at all in her book-length study of Santayanas poetry. And yet the poem has achieved a certain measure of recognition in virtue of its inclusion in anthologies of American verse such as Stedman, Untermeyer, and Olson; it is also included in Edman. 8. Santayana (Holzberger, Complete Poems 123). The sonnet was originally published in Santayana (Sonnets and Other Verses), his first volume of poems?and, indeed, his first book. 9. To reject Plato's dichotomy is not, of course, to deny that there is a distinction be tween appearance and reality.</page><page sequence="18">MCDERMiD : Platonists, Poets, and the Gods-Eye View 149 io. Those seeking detailed scholarly commentaries are directed to note , below. h. Cf. Schopenhauer (1:419). Obviously, there is a great deal to be said about the Allegory of the Cave; I can say barely the smallest fraction of it here. Those seeking instructive expositions of the Allegory may wish to begin with the following: Williams (26-37), Annas (ch. 10), White (183-187), Murdoch, and Cross and Woosley (ch. 9). 12. Cf. Campbell (245-246). Part I of Campbell gives detailed descriptions of each of the monomyth's principal stages and substages, generously illustrated with examples drawn from a variety of cultures and traditions. 13. Cf. Nietzsche, "How the 'True World' Finally Became a Fable: The History of an Error." 14. Cf. Kant. 15. Cf. Schopenhauer. For more on the peculiarities of Schopenhauer's version of tran scendental idealism, see McDermid ("Schopenhauer as Epistemologist?"; "World as Rep resentation"). 16. Note, too, how the doctrine of anamnesis or recollection reinforces this self-under standing. 17. Kant himself, it will be remembered, uses the image of free and soaring flight to express what he regards as the essential futility of Platonist metaphysics: The light dove, cleaving the air in her free flight, and feeling its resistance, might imagine that its flight would be still easier in empty space. It was thus that Plato left the world of the senses, as setting too narrow limits to the understanding, and ventured out beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of the pure understanding. He did not observe that with all his efforts he made no advance? meeting no resistance that might, as it were, serve as a support upon which he could take a stand, to which he could apply his powers, and so set his understanding in motion. (A5 / B9) A related scepticism about metaphysics is voiced in Santayana's sonnet "On A Volume of Scholastic Philosophy" (Holzberger, Complete Poems 123). 18. Compare this with the definition of religion offered in the preface to Schilpp {Dom inations and Powers 17-21). 19. "The true objects of piety are, of course, those on which life and its interests really depend: parents first, then family, ancestors, and country; finally, humanity at large and the whole natural cosmos" (Santayana, Life of Reason 258). 20. For more on the different ways poets and philosophers view contingency, see Rorty (Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity), chapter 2. For a brief but beautiful illustration of one way in which poetry can exploit contingency in the form of unrealized possibilities, see Jorge Luis Borges' poem "Things That Might Have Been" (the title of the original is in English) in Borges. For a commentary, see McDermid ("La poes?a"). 21. Cf. Sonnet XX in Holzberger (Complete Poems 100). 22. "Religion is normally the most traditional and national of things. It embodies and localises the racial heritage. Commandments of the law, feasts and fasts, temples and the tombs associated with them, are so many foci of communal life, so many points for the dissemination of custom" (Santayana, Life of Reason 259). 23. Cf. Rorty (Consequences of Pragmatism xiv-xix). 24. One notable manifestation of the yen for a God's-Eye View is the empiricist foun dationalist's appeal to the "Given," criticized in recent decades by Wilfrid Sellars, Ri chard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and John McDowell; for more on this controversy, see</page><page sequence="19">I50 THE PLURALIST 3 : 3 20 8 McDermid ("Pragmatism and Truth"; "Is Davidson's Epistemologa Coherent?"). Other contemporary forms of the reaction against the God s-Eye View and related conceptions of objectivity are discussed critically by Sosa. 25. Cf. Phaedo 82e for this image. 26. In this connection, see chapter 8 of Nussbaum, in which the Platonist conception of philosophy and its method are contrasted with Aristotle's revolutionary attempt to find objective truth without relying on the idea of "an unconditional vantage point" outside all human conceptions and practices (258). This notion of "an unconditional vantage point" is essentially another name for the Gods-Eye View. 27. Of course, I do not deny there are a number of recognizably Platonist themes and motifs in Santayana's mature philosophy?as, for instance, in his theory of essence and in his understanding of the spiritual life. Cf. Santayana {Scepticism and Animal Faith; Realm of Essence; Platonism) (but see pages 155-157 of the latter work, where Santayana distances his position from Plato's). For useful commentary, see Sprigge (Santayana 1974), chapters IV (on essence) and XI (on the spiritual life). 28. Cf. Stroud on Hume; Wittgenstein; and Strawson (Scepticism and Naturalism). 29. Santayana (Soliloquies in England #54; Animal Faith; "Apologia pro Mente Sua"); cf. Sprigge (Santayana), chapter III; Sprigge ("Santayana" 122-123). See also the remarks on animal faith in Cory (83-84,170-174,181-182,190-191, 292). 30. See Hodges and Lachs, who compare Santayana and Wittgenstein. 31. For more on Santayana's understanding of the concept of faith and on his reasons for using the term in this context, see Santayana ("Apologia pro Mente Sua" 588). 32. Cf. Greco (65fr), who explains why rejecting scepticism on the grounds that it is incredible is a "completely ineffective" anti-sceptical strategy. 33. Cf. Pierce, Selected Papers 5.416; 6.498; 7.323. 34. For the distinction, see Strawson (Individuals 9-11). Roughly speaking, so-called "descriptive" metaphysics makes explicit the conceptual scheme or structure we actually employ in thinking about the world, whereas "revisionary" metaphysics seeks to go be yond this structure and articulate something better. 35. On Santayana's Platonism, see note 27 above. 36. Cf. Charles Taylor's affirmation of "Judaeo-Christian theism" (521) as an answer to a related dilemma posed at the end of Taylor (cf. 518-521). The phrase from Hopkins is, of course, the first line of "God's Grandeur," reprinted in Gardner (27). Since this religious perspective and that of the rationalist metaphysician are both committed to the existence of a transcendent reality, some may wonder how we can distinguish them. Those who wish to get a sense of how the two are related may find it helpful to contrast Plato's Allegory with St. Bonaventure's Journey of the Mind to God, in which the visible world is compared both to a mirror (in which God is reflected) (2:1) and to a ladder (by means of which we can ascend to God) (In). It will be found, I think, that the differences between the two metaphors?that is, between that of an obscure and confining natural space in which real ity is concealed from unwitting captives, on the one hand, and that of artefacts that reveal or lead us to their creator, on the other?are far-reaching and repay sustained reflection.
