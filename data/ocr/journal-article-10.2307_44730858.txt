Zhu First Technology Safety Systems Copyright © 2001 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The SID-lls side impact dummy is a newly designed dummy as an anthropomorphic test device for small size person to be used in side impact crash testing. The head and neck are one of the key components for SID-lls dummy designing, manufacturing, and testing. This paper is focused on the development of a Headform to be used for neck calibration of the SID-lls side impact dummy. It will be very difficult in neck calibration measurement of the SID-lls dummy if its head is used for the test directly. The Headform is one of the methods to solve this problem. However, the Headform must be consistent in achieving equivalent functional performance as the dummy head and associated physical properties. A 3-D head model has been developed for obtaining initial basic information. The offset can be controlled within 3% during the engineering design of the Headform. The neck dynamic test has been done before the Headform test. The neck movement has also been analyzed by using the high-speed video system at testing. More tests have been conducted to evaluate the Headform performance at various calibration laboratories. Test results indicated that the performance of the Headform is consistent with the design concept of SID-lls Headform. Based on the test results analysis, the new Headform has yielded stable and repeatable results to match the calibration requirements. The Headform can therefore be used for the neck calibrating tests of the SID-lls side impact dummy. INTRODUCTION The SID-lls dummy has been developed to have capability in measuring specific data requirements needed for side impact research and investigation. The head and neck are both primarily taken from the Hybrid III 5th percentile frontal impact dummy. Modifications have been made to improve dynamic responses of the head. The SID-lls dummy is a 5lh percentile small female dummy for side impact tests. The SID-lls Headform is developed for use in testing of lateral neck response in the pendulum tests. Therefore, the Headform is a simulator of the SID-lls head. Reasons for development of the Headform are: 1. To simulate the Head with a simpler structure. The SID-lls head has a complicated human like shape, consisting of aluminum casting skull and vinyl Skin. The Headform also must be developed to assemble and disassemble easily 32</page><page sequence="2">and its cost should be much cheaper than dummy head. 2. To measure the lateral flexion angle as well as forces and moments during the impact, while the Head Assembly only can record the forces and moments in the test. 3. To reduce the measuring offset by simple structural design. The development requirements are as following: 1. The Headform should have the same weight, C.G. location as the Head Assembly of the SID- lls dummy head. 2. There are 3 moments of inertia - lxx, lyy, Izz. lxx is the most important parameter since the main head rotation is the lateral flexion about the X-axis during the impact. The neck is unsymmetrical along the X-axis in the XZ plane and the Head center of the gravity also has an offset along the X-axis. The neck has certain twist about the Z-axis because of some cuts in front of the neck. These cuts cause the neck to bend slightly along the Y-axis. Based on the above discussion, the design attention must be focused on lxx of the Headform, while other two should also be designed as close as possible to those of the head. 3. The flexion angle should be recorded during the impact. The instrumentation must be mounted at the correct location on the Headform to collect the data. 4. A 6-axis load cell is required in the Headform since the Head Assembly also has a 6-axis load cell. Six parameters such as Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My and Mz can be recorded. 3-D HEAD ASSEMBLY MODEL In order to find moments of inertia of the head, a 3-D solid head assembly model has been created. The CAD software is used for calculating the moments of inertia, weight, and C.G. location. The Pro-E is employed to develop the head assembly model. The complicated shape parts are digitized to created 3-D parts such as the head skull, skull cap, vinyl skin and skin cap. Then all the parts are assembled together to create a 3-D assembly model. Material densities are assigned to corresponding parts. An actual SID-lls Head Assembly is used to compare the weight generated with the 3-D model. The weight of the Head Assembly is 8.19 lbs, which is within the weight specification 8.10 +/- 0.10 lbs. All the actual parts, such as the skull, vinyl skin, load cell, screws, pin, and washers have been carefully weighed. Comparing the part weights between computer models and actual parts, the weights of machined part are the same because the machined dimensions of these parts are the same as those of the model. The casting parts, such as skulls and skins, are slightly different. The densities of casting parts of the 3-D model are adjusted to get the same weight of the actual one. The differences between the model and the actual pars are: Density Actual Density Difference (lb/in3) (lb/in3) Skull 0.0980 0.0955 2.6% Skull Cap 0.0980 0.0969 1.1% Skin 0.0390 0.0398 2.1% Skin Cap 0.0390 0.0396 1.5% The difference in parts density has been controlled to be within 3 % for all head parts. There are two reasons for the difference. The first reason is that each batch group for the vinyl skin and skull are slightly different and it will affect the density. Second reason is that models are obtained from digitizing the points on the parts for creating the surface for solid modeling. So the surfaces generated from the computer are a slightly different from the surfaces of the actual parts. 3 % offset is deemed to be good enough, implying that the computer model is very accurate. The total weight for the Head Assembly Model is 8.19 lbs, which is the same weight as actual Head Assembly. The Center of Gravity is also located within the specification of the dummy head by the Pro-E software calculation: From the model Specification Head Xcg (in) 2.30 2.25+/-0.10 Head Ycg (in) 0.00 0.00 Head Zcg (in) 1 .32 1 .30+/-0. 1 0 Figure 1 is a 3-D model of the Head Assembly with head skull, skull cap, vinyl skin and skin cap as well as all head parts. 33</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 . Head Assembly Model THE NECK PENDULUM TEST WITH HEAD ASSEMBLY The neck pendulum test with head assembly of SID- lls dummy was conducted. It was a standard calibration test of neck with recording of the high- speed video systems (1,000 f/sec). Due to the unsymmetrical and front cuts of the neck and the offset of the head center, the neck may has not only the lateral flexion, but also the twisting and bending when the pendulum beam was impacted for the neck lateral calibration tests. A lateral neck pendulum test has been conducted with a SID-lls Head to understand the head-neck kinetic performance during the impact test. The test event has been recorded by a high-speed video system as shown below. Figure 2. The Photo of Head Assembly from SID- lls lateral neck pendulum Test at the time zero. Figure 3. On the upstroke, the head rotates laterally with very little off-axis bending. There is a small rotation of the head clockwise (in this view), probably due to the head CG located forward of neck centerline. 34</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4. After the neck bottoms out on the upstroke, the head now rotates counter- clockwise (in this view). This is the opposite direction by CG offset, and is probably due to the asymmetry of the neck, more specifically the anterior slits. The neck also begins to go into rearward extension. Figure 5. On the rebound, the rearward extension of the neck is evident. This motion requires the additional degrees of freedom in the potentiometer measurement. It is clear that the main behavior of the neck in the lateral impact is the flexion combined slightly twisting and bending. There is about 25 degree bending extension on rebound mainly due to the neck front cuts. Although we are not interested in the rebound process, this motion needs more degree of freedom in the instrumentation measurement. HEADFORM CONCEPT There are many parameters such as the weight, center of gravity, moment of inertia, and instrumentation that are required for the Headform concept development. There are also some physical constraints, such as the mechanism should have enough degree of freedom so that no interference occurs during the impact. The Headform design is based on all those requirements. Basically, the Headform is comprised of three major parts: the front disk, rear disk, and center bracket which connects the front and rear disks. A six-axis load cell is mounted under the center bracket. A center potentiometer is mounted on the rear disk. An extended shaft is connected to the center potentiometer shaft on one end with the other end being supported on the front disk. A basic 3-D assembly model was first created including all the necessary parts. Dimensional parameters, such as the thickness, width, height, as well as the shape were adjusted to meet the weight and center of gravity specifications. Since the shapes of the head and Headform are so different, it is almost impossible to design a Headform that has the same moments of inertial of the head. However, the design goal is to obtain a design that is as close as possible to the head properties. Since the rotation resulted from the lateral impact is around the X-axis, the moment of inertia, lxx, is the most important one to match. Many efforts were directed toward achieving this design goal by studying the moment of inertia from the 3-D model, figuring out materials that need to be added to or removed from which part and along which direction, changing the dimensions and re-checking the data. 35</page><page sequence="5">All possible physical interferences also were considered during the design phase. The final design is shown in the Figure 6 and their parameters obtained from the Pro-E software are compared with the head model as listed below: Headform Head Model Offset Specification Weight (lbs): 8.17 8.19 0.36% 8.10+/-0.10 CGx(in): 2.18 2.30 5.50% 2.25+/-0.1 CGy (in): 0.00 0,00 0.00% 0.00 CGz(in): 1.36 1.32 2.94% 1.30+/-0.10 lxx (lb-in2): 53.15 54.16 1.92% lyy (lb-in2): 97.15 111.97 15.43% Izz (lb-in2): 90.74 87.78 3.10% Figure 6. SID-lls Headform Design 36</page><page sequence="6">From the data given above, it can be seen that the Headform weight and C.G. are close to the head model within the specifications. The moments of inertia, lxx and Izz are very close to the head model within 4%. The lyy has an offset 15.43%, which is not considered to be a big issue since the impact is along the Y direction. The instrumentation mechanism is adapted from EUROSID-1 Headform (Figure 7). EUROSID-1 Headform (Figure 7) is developed by The TNO Crash-Safety Research Center. Figure 7. The Instrumentation Mechanism of EUROSID-1 Headform Three rotational potentiometers are used to measure the rotational angles at the EUROSID-1 Headform during impact tests. One is mounted on the center of the Headform along the X-axis. The other two are inserted into the front and rear pivot brackets respectively. These two pivot brackets are assembled at the side of the neck- pendulum adaptor plate by two shoulder screws, which are used also as the pin joints. Two potentiometers are installed in parallel to the existing one in the Headform. Since there are pin joints between the adaptor and pivot brackets, the potentiometers can rotate along the Y direction. A fiberglass rod is inserted into the Front Potentiometer Housing so that the rod can slide in the housing. The other end of the rod is pinned to a pivot, which is inserted to the center shaft that, in turn, is connected to the center potentiometer in the Headform. Another fiberglass rod is inserted into the rear potentiometer housing with the same structure. Because of all the slide joints and pivots, the instrumentation mechanism has provided more flexibility of flexion, extension, twisting, and bending when impacted. Figure 8. SID-lls Headform Prototype A prototype was manufactured on the design as shown in Figure 8. The Headform weighs 8.17 lbs which is the same as the model. The flexibility of the Headform was checked manually by rotating the head while fixing the Neck-Pendulum Adaptor Plate. No interference was found and the maximum rotation angles are: Lateral flexion: 90 deg Bending (extension): 90 deg Twisting: 90 deg 37</page><page sequence="7">The SID-lls Headform consists of instrumentations as following: • One velocity measurement equipment measuring the impact velocity. • One uniaxial Acceleration transducer measuring the pendulum acceleration • One six-axis upper neck load cell at the base of the Head Form Center Bracket to measure the force and torque during the impact. • Three rotational potentiometers F (Forward), R (Rearward), and H (head) to obtain the Head Form rotation by the calculation. The base angle F and R, shown in the Figure 9, are directly measured during the certification test. The flexion angle of the Head Form must be calculated using following equation: ß= 0f+0h-3ī/2 or ß= d©F+ d©H In which case d©Fand d0H are the deviations of the angles 0Fand 0H. Figure 9. Schematic Set-up for SID-lls Neck Pendulum Test Figure 10. Headform With Instrumentations HEADFORM EVALUATION Two kinds of tests were conducted for the Headform evaluation. One is the Headform - Neck Pendulum test to check the repeatability performance on the same neck and different necks. The other is the Head - Neck Pendulum test is to check how close the performances between the Headform and Head. The whole assembly was mounted to the pendulum for the Headform tests. The pendulum was raised about 116 ° and then released. A honeycomb of 25 cells was hit by the end of pendulum beam. Figure 10 is the Headform with instrumentations. The Head Form also can be performed as the right side impact. When the Headform tested in the right side, the following steps can be conducted: • Remove whole assembly from the pendulum, rotate it 180 degree, and mount the Neck Mounting Plate into the pendulum. • Switch two Rods - Forward and Rearward Rod so that the Forward Pot is always nearest the Honeycomb. Lightly tighten the screws in the clevis of the Forward Rod Assembly to clamp it to the center shaft. • Switch the Forward and Rearward Pot channels too. 38</page><page sequence="8">Seven channels were used to record the data: 1 channel for pendulum accelerometer 1 channel for impact velocity 1 channel for the force along the Y direction on the Six-axis neck load cell 1 channel for the moment along the X direction on the 6-axis neck load cell 3 channels for the rotation potentiometers A series of left side impact tests were conducted with two different necks. Test results are displayed in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. The left side neck tests are very consistent in the timing and peak values. Figure 13 shows the comparison of the right side impact tests. The curves are also very close to each other. Figure 11. Headform 1 Left Side, Flexion Angle vs. Time 39</page><page sequence="9">Figure 12. Headform 2 Left Side, Flexion Angle vs. Time Figure 13. Headform 1 and 2 Right Side, Flexion Angle vs. Time 40</page><page sequence="10">COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HEAD ASSEMBLY AND HEADFORM TESTS Tests were also conducted for the SID-lls Neck Calibration. The purpose was to compare test results for these tests, particularly, the force Fy along the Y direction and moment Mx about the X direction to see how close the performance of the Headform to the Head. The Headform was replaced with head assembly of SID-lls dummy during tests. Two rods were also removed. The same neck was used in the test. A six-axis load cell was mounted in the head to monitor all the neck force/moment information. Two left side tests and two right side tests were conducted for the same head and neck. Results indicated that the force Fy and moment Mx are very close in these four tests with terms of the maximum value and peak time. No rotation potentiometers were used in the Head - Neck pendulum tests. To compare the head test with Headform test results, test data are overlaid from other 5 Headform tests. It is shown on the Figures 1 4 and 1 5 for the comparison. It can be found out the moment and force plots in good agreement. Maximum moment of the Head is about 10% more than the Headform while the maximum force of the Head is about 1 5% more than the Headform. This discrepancy is believed due to certain energy loss in the rotational and slip joints in three rotational potentiometers instrumented in the Headform. Figure 14. Moment Mx Comparison 41</page><page sequence="11">Figure 15. Force Fy Comparison CONCLUSION Three-Dimension Model of the Head Assembly has been used for the development of the Headform as presented in this paper. It is a powerful tool for new design or development. Instrumentation used in the Headform has provided repeatable and reliable results in tests conducted thus far. Results have shown consistency between the Headform and Head Assembly tests for the SID-lls Dummy. The Headform is capable of providing more measurements than the Head Assembly and can replace Head Assembly in the Neck Pendulum testing of the SID-lls Dummy.
