<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES THE TARGUM RENDERING OF WYG'H IN JOB X 16 The Massoretic Text of Job x 16a reads wyg'h kshl tswdny. The verb wyg'h has no clearly expressed subject. The Revised Version sup- plies the words "my head", and translates, "and if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion", thus understanding wyg'h to refer back to r'sy in verse 15b, though the intervening words in 15c make this rather remote as a subject. Another difficulty of wyg'h is that a verb in the 3rd person singular seems out of place in 16a. The sub- ject of the verbs in 15a, b is Job, speaking in the 1st person singular, while in verses 16b and 17 he goes on to address God in the 2nd per- son singular. Scholars have followed two basic approaches to the problem of wyg'h. Some' have emended it to give a reading in the 2nd person singular, making God the subject of 16a, and connect- ing it with what follows in 16b and 17. Others2 have emended it to give a reading in the 1st person singular, making Job the subject, and connecting 16a with what precedes it. There is some versional support for this latter approach. The LXX uses a verb in the 1st person singular in its translation of the first half of verse 16, reading, 'ypeuooact yap Wcaorep Xicov edc acproayv, "for I am hunted as a lion for the slaughter". The Peshitta reads, w'n 'ttryn, "And if I am exalted", which suggest an original of w'g'h instead of wyg'h.3 The purpose of the present note is to suggest that, with only a minor emendation, the Targum may support the Peshitta reading. The Targum renders Job x 16a with the words, w'rym ydyh hyk 'ary' tswdyty, 4 "he lifts his hand; like a lion thou huntest me". Thus the Targum, as the text stands, supports the MT by its rendering of wyg'h with the words w'rym ydyh "he lifts his hand". There are, however, a number of considerations which raise doubt whether the text of the Targum has been transmitted correctly. Firstly, the 3rd person singular verb of the Targum seems even more out of place than that which it represents in the MT, situated as it is between the 1st person singular of verse 15 and the 2nd person singular of the rest of verse 16, since the objectydyh makes it impossible to con- strue the verb as referring back to "my head" in verse 15. Second- ly, the Targum rendering involves the use of an anthropomor- phism. The suffix in ydyh must be understood as referring to God. Now it is true that, unlike other Targumim, the Targum of Job usually renders parts of the body literally when applied to God.5 It is also true that in Job x there are three instances in which a Vetus Testamentum XXXIV, 3 (1984) 367</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTES reference to the hand(s) of God is translated literally by the Targum (vv. 3, 7, 8). In each case, however, the Targum is representing what is there in the Hebrew. It is scarcely credible that the Targum should introduce an anthropomorphism which is not already pres- ent in the Hebrew text, as appears to be the case in x 16. Thirdly, the Targum of Job generally prefers to translate verbs using the same tense as the Hebrew. In Job's speech in ix 2-x 22 the MT uses the perfect tense 33 times, of which 30 are rendered in the Targum by a perfect tense, and 3 by a participle. In this speech the MT uses the imperfect tense (without waw consecutive) 81 times. Of these, 69 are translated in the Targum by an imperfect, 5 by a perfect, and 4 by a participle.6 Of the 5 cases in which the Targum uses a perfect to render what is an imperfect in the MT, 4 are in x 10 f., and the remaining one is the verb under discussion in x 16. In the MT of x 10 f. all the verbs are imperfects, and the Targum con- sistently uses perfects in place of them. The MT of x 16 contains 4 verbs in the imperfect tense. In the Targum 3 of these are translated by an imperfect; it is only wyg'h which is translated by a perfect. This may mean that the Targum read the w of wyg'h as a waw con- secutive.7 On the other hand, if the Targum read the w as a waw conjunctive, then its use of a perfect to represent what is an im- perfect in the MT is contrary to its normal practice and leaves its rendering open to question. With one very minor change to the consonantal text of the Targum, however, all these difficulties can be removed and the Targum can be seen to support the rendering of the Peshitta. The only necessary change is to delete the h fromydyh as a dittography from the following hyk. This would give a 1st person singular pro- nominal suffix instead of the 3rd person masculine singular suffix of the received text of the Targum. The verb w'rym should then be taken not as an AphCel 3rd person masculine singular perfect but as an AphCel 1st person singular imperfect. The Targum text of w rym ydy should then be translated, "and (if) I lift my hand ..." The meaning would be that whatever Job does God hunts him as a lion. Once the error had entered the text of the Targum it would readily have been transmitted under the influence of the MT. If this is ac- cepted, then the Targum as well as the Peshitta (cf. also the LXX) will support the emendation of MT wyg'h to w'g'h. 368 Chester-le-Street D. M.

Suggestions about the Presidency and the place of meeting in 1989 may be sent to Professor J. A. Emerton, St John's College, Cambridge, CB2 1TP, U.K. They should reach him not later than 1 May 1985. BOOK LIST J.-ALETTI and J. TRUBLET, Approche poitique et theologique des Psaumes. Analyses et methodes. 297 pp. Les Editions du Cerf, Paris, 1983. The authors attempt to show the value for exegesis of the Psalms of combining the insights of literary structure, of form criticism and of semantic study which is sensitive to poetic usage. This is believed to draw out best the individuality of each psalm, too often overlooked in regularly scholarly interpretation. The discussion is liberally illustrated with examples so that, by use of the index, it is possible to find com- ment of this sort on nearly every psalm. Somewhat surprisingly, the book is in- tended primarily for lay Bible students. No knowledge of Hebrew is presuppos- ed, and the usual accompaniments of scholarly writing are lacking. The authors express the hope that their readers will apply the methods illustrated for themselves, though, despite the clarity of the explanations, this would still de- mand a considerable degree of expertise. This is an attractive and suggestive book. The authors should be encouraged to publish an example or two of their exegesis based on the Hebrew text and in dialogue with other commentators so that their method may be better tested and appreciated.

A commentary on Job is always impor- tant, especially when the authors are a famed O.T. scholar and an expert in Ugaritic studies. The former's scholarship determines the book's lines of literary criticism and pertinent theological observations. It is strange to see on the back cover the first author described as "L. A.
