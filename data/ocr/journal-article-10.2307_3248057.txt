CARL W. BISHOP: NOTES ON THE TOMB OF HO CH'U-PING O N BEHALF OF THE FREER GALLERY OF ART, I SET OUT FROM PEKING ON March o, 1924, for the famous Wei River valley, accompanied by my two associates, Mr. A. G. Wenley and Mr. K. Z. Tung, and by the Vice-Director of the Historical Museum, Mr. T. Y. Ch'iu. Upon our arrival at Hsi-an we were kindly entertained by the Governor, Gen. Liu Chen-hua, who provided us with saddle-horses and helped us in many other ways in the accomplishment of our mission. After visiting and studying Old Ch'ang-an, the Pei-Wei region, the tomb of T'ang T'ai-tsung, and other sites of interest, we set out from the village of Li-ch'uen early on the morning of March 25th for the town of Hsing-ping, fifty ii to the southward. After several hours' ride across the loess plateau, past fields, grave mounds, groves, and mud villages, we descended the steep and heavily eroded scarp to the town, in the alluvial valley below. The historic Wei River, we were told, was about fifteen ii to the south, although 34</page><page sequence="2">hidden from us in the distance by the haze. The magistrate, a Mr. Li,* a very pleasant, scholarly young man, kindly put us up at his Yamen, and promised to go with us next day to the tombs of Han Wu-ti and Ho Ch'ii-ping. At the latter, he informed us that evening at dinner, he had recently discovered and excavated a second horse. We were again in the saddle at 7:30 the following morning, and started out in a northeasterly direction, accompanied by our friend the Magistrate in his fine new mule-cart. The road steadily ascended, winding over several wide and well cultivated terraces, until we again found ourselves on the plateau across which we had ridden the day before; in the fields of young wheat we passed numerous gangs of wild geese resting and feeding on their annual flight northward. Presently, while still a great way off, we began to see the tomb of HanWu-ti, an enormous truncated pyramid of earth, in places deeply eroded. Its vast bulk, as we slowly approached it across the plain, gave an impression of size and majesty equalled by no other mound that I have seen, save possibly that generally known as the tomb of Ch'in Shih-huang. Our Chinese companions told us that it was 140 feet in height. Unfortunately we were without means of measuring it accurately, our flexible leveling-rod having disappeared in the course of our travels; both Mr. Wenley and I agreed, however, that this estimate could not be greatly in excess of the truth. Our friend the Magistrate had had the mound planted with young evergreens, a double row running up each angle, while another went around the summit and a few were scattered about over the level space at the top. Just west of Han Wu-ti's tomb was another, much smaller, said to be that of his favorite concubine, Li Fu-jen, whose departed spirit the magician Shao Weng is said to have recalled momentarily for the inconsolable Emperor. After completing our inspection of these two tombs, we proceeded to another group, composed of three tumuli in a row, about a quarter of a mile to the east of that of the great Early Han emperor. Of these, the two outer, we were told, were the graves of Ho Ch'ii-ping's younger brother, Ho Kuang, and uncle, Wei Ching, the minister of Wu-ti and like his nephew a winner of distinction in the wars with the Hsiung-nu. As we shall see, however, there appears to be some disagreement regarding the tomb of Ho Kuang. Be that as it may, these two tumuli offered no features of particular interest. * I regret that I am unable to give the Magistrate's full name, not having his card by me. 35</page><page sequence="3">The middle one of the three, however, that commonly called the tomb of Ho Ch'ii-ping, is one of the most individual and peculiar that I have ever seen. That it is in reality only a monument to the famous young cavalry leader, his actual tomb being a small and inconspicuous heap of earth about a hundred yards to the north, we were informed by Mr. Li. About fifty feet in height and rather more sharply conical than its neighbors, its slopes also had been planted with small evergreens by the Magistrate. It was surmounted by a small brick shrine facing north, while at its northern foot was a group of mud-walled buildings. These, as stated by M. Lartigue in his most interesting article,* are all recent, nor are there visible any evidences of structures of an earlier date. Unlike any other grave mound that I have ever seen, this one has scattered over its flanks and about its base numerous boulders, some of them carved while others bear no trace of the chisel. One of the largest we estimated to measure twelve feet in length by five in width and three in thickness, so that it must weigh not far short of fifteen tons. As pointed out by M. Lartigue (p. 91), these masses of stone are not native to the locality, but must have been brought from a distance. As many of them show signs of being waterworn, they may have come originally from the bed of the Wei or some of its tributary streams. Their presence here is no doubt correctly explained by the statement quoted by M. Lartigue (p. 92) that the Emperor ordered the tomb to be constructed to resemble the mountains of Chi-lien. The first sculpture to draw our attention was of course the now famous group showing the horse trampling the barbarian, the latter presumably one of those Hsiung-nu over whom Ho Ch'ii-ping gained such brilliant victories.** This has already been so fully described*** that we need pause but briefly over it. Its po- sition, just south of the mound and a few feet to the west of the main north-and- south axis so well shown in M. Lartigue's plan (p. 86), fully justifies Segalen's suggestion that it not only occupies its original place but that it is the survivor of a pair, or perhaps several pairs, of figures which once flanked the approach to * Jean Lartigue, Au tombeau de Houo-k'iu-Ping; Artibus Asiae, 1927, No. 2. ** For an account of the career of Ho Ch'i-ping, cf.

The recumbent man is clad in short trousers and sleeveless tunic his arms and legs apparently bare, the figure being chiseled partly in a simulation of the full round and partly in low relief; the latter is especially true of his hands and feet. It is interesting to note that the bow in his left hand is evidently, from its cur- vature of the reflex or composite type so widely used in Asia. The occurrence of this highly -~ FIG. t.

On the contrary, making all due allowances, it recalls rather Scythian types like some of those on the silver vase from Chertomlyk (Nicopol) and that of electron from Kul Oba. It tends to confirm the view, otherwise inherently probable in the light of recent linguistic discoveries in Cen- tral Asia, that there was a pronounced Iranian element among the Hsiung-nu. It is interesting to note, in this connection, the occurence in northwestern China of a very long faced non-Mongoloid type which members of the Anatomical Department of the Peking Union Medical College have recently been studying, and of which I also have seen many examples. * On this see Edmund Bulanda, Bogen und Pfeil bei den Volkern des Altertums, where very many interesting details are given. ** Abel-Remusat wisely remarked long ago, "On a cru les nations civilisees de l'ancien monde plus complhtement isoldes, et plus dtrang6res les unes aux autres, qu'elles ne l'etaient reellement." The gaps between cultures are steadily contracting as research advances. 37</page><page sequence="5">Of all the sculptures found in connection with the mound of Ho Ch'ii-ping, this is the only one showing an animal standing upright. The motif, that of a man and a beast struggling together, is of course an extremely ancient one, particularly in western Asiatic art. The similarity in conception and even in a measure in execution between this group and that at Babylon cited by M. Hentze* is most striking; nor, in view of the numerous culture elements known to have reached China from western Asia around this very time, is a genetic relationship by any means wholly excluded. In his paper Segalen merely states that indications of other sculptures exist on the northern or opposite face of the mound. His visit of course took place before the excavation of the second horse; and moreover, to judge from the shadows in his photograph, it occurred very late in the afternoon, when he must naturally have been hastening to reach his night's resting place. It is therefore quite com- prehensible why, in his article, he has given us no description of any other sculp- tures. That several exist nevertheless, M. Lartigue has shown us in his paper already mentioned. On the northern slope of the mound, just east of the ascent to the shrine on the summit, we came upon the huge figure of the waterbuffalo so strikingly depicted in M. Lartigue's article (Figs. 4 and 5). As there stated (p. 90), it at present lies in a steeply sloping position with its head pointing down-hill (Fig. 2). Although considerably weathered and thickly covered with lichens, the details are still clear and present several points of extreme interest. In the first place, it is curious that the figure of a buffalo should appear in this region at all; for at the present day that animal does not occur in northern China, but only in those regions where irrigated rice forms the staple crop. It is known, however, that the Han emperors, like other ancient monarchs,** collected at their capital strange animals from remote regions. It may also be recalled in this connection that Dr. J. G. Andersson, the eminent Swedish archaeologist, discovered in a peat-bog some thirty miles east of Peking the skull of a water- * Carl Hentze, Les influences (trangeres dans le monument de Houo-K'iu-Ping; Artibus Asiae, 1926, pp. 31 et seq. ** Cf. the menagerie, including elephants, wild bulls, stags, gazelles, and panthers, gathered by Assur-nazir-pal at Kalhu, and the exotic animals depicted on the famous Black Obelisk of Shal- maneser. 38</page><page sequence="6">FIG. 2. FIGURE OF KNEELING BUFFALO, BEARING SADDLE-PAD AND STIRRUPS buffalo and the bones of a water-deer (Hydropotes inermis) in connection with remains of the Han Dynasty; the geological evidence too, according to Dr. An- dersson, suggests some change of climate within the historic period.* Another very interesting feature of this statue is that it bears upon its back the incised outline of a saddle-pad with pendant stirrups. One of the latter may be distinguished in M. Lartigue's photograph (Fig. 5), directly above the hind hoof of the buffalo and about 12 mm. below the line of its back. Owing to the fact that this feature has been incised, it may have been added at some later time, although this seems on the whole unlikely. * Dr. J. G. Andersson, Essays on the Cenozoic of Northern China, in Memoirs of the Geological Survey of China, Mch., 19253 for references to this find, cf. pp. 84 and 90 et seq. 39</page><page sequence="7">According to my colleague, Dr. C. Li, no mention of stirrups is found in Chinese literature until post-Han times, or in other words until not far from four centuries after the death of Ho Ch'ii-ping, in 117 B. C. They seem to have become known in Europe not long after the beginning of the Christian Era, their introduction being ascribed to various peoples of central or western Asiatic origin. Possibly they were known sporadically in both Orient and Occident long before they came into general use in either region. In any case, assuming that this representation of stirrups really dates from the time of Ho Ch'ii-ping, it would seem to be the first known record of the use of these instruments anywhere in the world. Another point of interest in connection with this figure is the fact that the buffalo is represented as kneeling, in the position so common in the animal art of the South Siberian and Scythic area, and, earlier still, in Mesopotamia.* To this point we shall return later. Flanking the door of the small shrine at the top of the mound are two crudely executed figures of fish about four feet in length, which from their position and the similarity in their size and manner of execution evidently form a pair. It will be recalled that the symbol of the paired fish, usually if not always with their bodies joined, occurs very early in China. It appears, for example, among appar- ently genuine carved bone amulets of the Shang Dynasty, and is mentioned more than once during the Chou period.** Its frequency in sculptured and pictorial designs of later times is of course well known. In the present case, the two fish are entirely separate, and although they no doubt also had a symbolic significance, their flattened backs suggest that functionally they served as pedestals of some sort. It seems unlikely that they should have been placed where they now are at any period subsequent to the erection of the mound; on the contrary, their present position must be approximately their original one. Not far from the two fish, a large flat boulder bears incised on it a crude face of some sort, and seems to represent by its general contours a winged creature, such as a bird or a bat. Another carved stone, no doubt that referred to by M. Lartigue (p. 90) as perhaps intended for a stag, appeared to me to suggest vaguely a tiger. * Cf., e. g., W. H. Ward, The Cylinder Seals of Western Asia, Washington, 1910; the kneeling human-headed bull, Fig. 522, p. 115, and the bronze lion, Fig. 42 , on p. 159, are examples. ** Cf. Chavannes, Memoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien, vol. III., p. 426 and p. 5; also ibid., Sculptures sur pierre en Chine, p. 56. 40</page><page sequence="8">That some animal form was intended is certain; but the figure is too incomplete to make any definite identification possible. Others among the boulders scattered over the mound seem to bear traces of having been artificially shaped; but these are all so badly eroded that it is impossible without much further study even to conjecture what creatures were originally represented. After completing our inspection of the figures on the mound itself, we were invited to see still another carving, in the courtyard of the small group of buildings at the foot of the slope, to the north. Here we found what was in many ways the most remarkable piece of sculpture that I have seen in China. A large boulder, evidently waterworn, about nine feet in length by five in breadth, displays upon its surface, partly incised and partly in low relief, the figures of an anthropomorphic monster grappling to its breast an animal of con- siderably smaller size. The former's right arm and leg are clearly to be seen, the bent position of the knee suggesting that the creature is sitting. Its left arm and hand and the toes of the left foot, which confront and approach closely those of the right, appear from under the lower surface of the boulder, showing that the latter is carved over its entire surface. It is evident, indeed, that the monument must originally have stood upright, perhaps on some such a base as that offered by one of the fish already described. Although at first glance quite dissimilar, further study discloses certain likenesses between this figure and that of the horse and recumbent barbarian on the south side of the mound. In both is portrayed the motif-, so common, it will be recalled, in western Asiatic art, of a struggle between man and beast; and in both, the treatment of the heavy beards and hair, indicated by series of parallel incisions, and the manner of representing the hands and feet are closely similar. M. Lartigue refers (p. 91) to the animal clasped in the ogre's arms and in whose throat he seems about to sink his enormous teeth, as a ram. All of our party, however, Chinese and foreigners alike, took it for a bear (Fig. 3). The flatly truncated muzzle, the short, rounded ears, and the thick fringe of hair on both sides of the creature's head, indicated by series of short parallel strokes, appeared to us to leave no doubt on this point. In fidelity to nature and in mastery of technique, indeed, this detail of the carving seemed to me only second to that of the head of the second horse, to which we shall come in a moment. Further, the right foot appearing in my photograph as that of the monster, as well as the two 41</page><page sequence="9">feet which M. Lartigue's sketch shows as belonging to the animal, are in both cases of plantigrade type, instead of terminating in hoofs, as would be the case were they those of a ram. After our return to Peking, the suggestion was made in the course of a conver- sation with certain Chinese archaeologists that many of the early rulers of the YangtseRiver state of Ch'u had as a component of their names the word &lt;Hsiung&gt; or &lt;&lt;bear&gt;&gt;,* and that this sculpture may therefore symbolize the conquest of that state by Ch'in. It seems, however, better to regard it as the portrayal of a wholly mythical struggle of the sort so common everywhere in folklore and art; that between Gilga- mesh and Khumbaba, or between Herakles and Ge- ryon, as well as very many others, will at once suggest themselves. It seems not * On these cf. A. Tschepe, FIG. 3.

GENERAL VIEW OF SECOND HORSE improbable that the conformation of the boulder itself suggested its utilization for some such a motif. At a distance of roughly fifty feet to the north of the mound, and slightly to the west of the main north-and-south axis, we came upon the partly excavated figure of the second horse of which the Magistrate had told us the preceding evening. A comparison of our photograph (Fig. 4) with those taken by M. Lar- tigue (Figs. 2 and 3) shows that in the brief interval between his visit, at the end of 1923, and ours, in March of the following year, the base of the statue had already been covered again; whether purposely or not, is uncertain. It is most fortunate that we have M. Lartigue's excellent photographs, as otherwise we should know nothing of the manner in which the lower portions and especially the legs had been represented. The head (Fig. 5) is much finer than that of the first horse, and is all in all the finest piece of sculpture here; the treatment of the lower ex- tremities, however, is not dissimilar, and there seems no reason to doubt that both statues are of the same period. It is to be noted that the second horse, unlike the first, stands not at right-angles to the main north-and south axis but parallel to it, with its head pointing to the north. Its greater distance from the mound may perhaps be taken as partial confirmation of the Magistrate's assertion that the actual tomb 43</page><page sequence="11">of Ho Ch'ii-ping was the small hillock already mentioned as . 5.

This thought also occurred to me at the time of our visit 1 was particularly reminded of the well known horse sculptured in high relief on the wall of the cliff shelter at Cap- Blanc, ascribed to the early Magdaleniang the horse's head engraved on bone from the Grotte du Pape, Brassempouy, and that carved from reindeer's antler from the hniquagalenian layer at Mas d'Azil also display something of the same spirit. It is scarcely necessary to add that no direct genetic connection is suggested. After we had completed our examination of the tomb, the Magistrate guided us to a small village about half a mile to the southeast. Here we found an oil- press, lashed to which, to increase its weight, were an old millstone and a water worn boulder about five feet in length The latter was rudely carved in the semblance of what the villagers, no doubt rightly, called a rat, although my first impression was that a pig was intended (Fig. 6). Here also the creature's legs were doubled under its body. The villagers told us that they had taken the figure from the mound, to which Mr. Li assured us he would have it returned. The technique displayed here was on the whole similar to that in the case of the ogre and bear; that is, the details were indicated in low relief or by incised lines, the original shape of the boulder being but little modified. That other figures formerly existed is almost certain; but if they still remain in 44</page><page sequence="12">FIG. 6. FIGURE OF A RAT(?) TAKEN FROM THE MOUND OF HO CH'U-PING BY THE PEOPLE OF A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE the vicinity, they must be concealed beneath the earth, where excavation alone can disclose them. It is possible, of course, that the various statues may be the work of different periods; but, as M. Lartigue points out (pp. 91 et seq.) this is most unlikely. From this village we rode some distance farther to the southeast, to the brink of the scarp, which we descended in order to regain tho main highway leading to Hsien- yang and Hsi-an. Many other tumuli were visible scattered about the edge of the plateau; among them was one which was pointed out to us as the real tomb of Ho Kuang, the younger brother of Ho Ch'ii-ping. Which identification is the correct one, I should not presume to say; indeed, Dr. V. K. Ting, formerly Director of the Geological Survey of China, tells me that most of the attributions of ancient tombs are based upon tradition eked out by guesswork, of the Sung Dynasty or later. It has been suggested that the animal figures about the tomb of Ho Ch'ii-ping belong, with one or two exceptions, to the well known Duodenary Cycle. Cha- vannes has traced the knowledge of this among the Chinese back to the first century A. D.* According to a late but apparently good authority which he cites, it was first introduced by certain Hsiung-nu who settled in northeastern Shansi in the middle of the first century A. D.** At all events, according to Chavannes, * Ed. Chavannes, Le cycle turc des douze animaux; T'oung pao, 1906, pp. 78 et seq. ** 1. c., pp. 84 et seq. 45</page><page sequence="13">it can not be earlier than the first or second century B. C. That some connection exists between the Chinese and the Turkic cycles is undoubtedly the case, and that it is due to the contacts between the former and the Hsiung-nu during the Han Dynasty or slightly earlier seems inherently probable. It will require much more study, however, to establish a relation between the animals of the Cycle and those represented about the tomb of Ho Ch'ii-ping. The paired fish at the summit of the mound, for example, although they recall the sign Pisces in the Occidental Zodiac, do not occur in the Chinese Cycle. Nevertheless it is difficult to avoid the feeling that we have here almost certain indications of an influence in all probability emanating from Central Asiatic regions, and perhaps even, ultimately, from others still farther to the west. There would seem, for example, to be some connection between the stone figures here and those erected on or about grave mounds in the Scytho-Siberian area and known as Kamennya Baby.* The presence, among other creatures, of two horses recalls the well-known Central Asiatic custom of killing these animals and sus- pending their bodies on poles about the tombs of the illustrious dead. Further, the water-buffalo, the second horse, the rat, and the unknown animal figure, whether cervine or feline, are all shown kneeling or crouching, like so many of the beast-forms depicted in Scythic art, as in that of Mesopotamia of a still earlier period. In any case, there is nothing whatever about these statues suggestive of the sym- bolic and hieratic art of the Chou period. They impress one with the feeling that they are not specimens of an archaic phase of an indigenous Chinese art, but, on the contrary, that they represent an effort to reproduce motifs and methods already well developed in some land other than China. It is as if a people accustomed to the delineation of objects through the medium of incised lines and low relief were trying, not quite successfully, to express forms in the full round. We seem to be witnessing here not the birth of something new and native, but a step in the acclimatization of an art exotic and still ill at ease in its Chinese habiliments. In conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation of M. Lartigue's article, which I have found most helpful and illuminating. I still recall with pleasure my meeting with its author, in Peking, in October, 1925. * Cf. e. g., E. H. Minns, Scythians and Greeks, p. 239. 46</page></plain_text>
