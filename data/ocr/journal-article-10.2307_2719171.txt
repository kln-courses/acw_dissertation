<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ise monogatari. A Short Cultural History RICHARD BOWRING University of Cambridge A CASE OF TEXTUAL ANXIETY T HE Ise monogatari is one of the most important texts of Jap- anese culture; it also happens to be the most enigmatic. A cor- rect appraisal of how the text operates is crucial to an understanding of how Japanese have used language, providing useful clues to reading much that came after. Such concerns, however, have already been well addressed in a recent thesis by Richard Okada, which represents one of the most important contributions to the study of classical Japanese narrative to have emerged in the last twenty years.' This subject will be touched upon but does not form the central issue of the present essay, which is rather a study of how the Ise was read by successive generations, a description of inter- pretative strategies that may perhaps serve as a prologomenon to a different kind of cultural history. The Ise offers a particularly rich field for such study, richer in many ways than that provided by the Genji monogatari; for while it cannot approach the Genji in terms of sheer difficulty and stylistic complexity, it presents almost insuperable problems to the reader l Richard Okada, "Unbound Texts: Narrative Discourse in Heian Japan," Unpub.

What emerges from such a study is that the un- tutored non-native reader is not the only one who has had trouble. We shall discover that despite its role as a source text for other works of literature and art right down to the nineteenth century, the Ise itself has always been seen as a "problem" to be dealt with and to be explained. On one level there are the textual variants, the in- terrelationship of which is still a matter of substantial and lively scholarly debate. On a deeper level, questions of its genesis, its struc- ture, its authorship, and its meaning have proved highly seductive to scholars from the thirteenth century to the present day, and this extensive tradition of scholarly exegesis is of interest in its own right. The Ise has always managed in the end to frustrate attempts to bring it to heel; it has engendered what can only be called an acute sense of anxiety, manifest in the constant drive to comment, explain, and categorize. So what kind of work are we faced with when we open the first page?2 The Ise begins as follows: In the past, a man who has come of age goes hunting on his estate in the village of Kasuga near the Nara capital. In that village live two very beautiful sisters. The man sees them through a gap in the fence. Amazed to find such an incongruity in the old capital, he loses his head. Ripping off the hem of his hunting cloak, he writes down a poem and sends it in. Now the fabric is a purple print called "wild passion": "Ah young purple fern of Kasugano, this printed cloak, the wild disorder of my passion knows no limit." He sends word in just like an adult. Perhaps he feels the situation calls for something unusual, for it uses a similar con- ceit to the poem: "Whose fault is it that this wild print from Shinobu in Michinoku has become disordered? Hardly mine." Thus do men of old act with passionate style.3 2 Three English translations of the Ise already exist: both Fritz Vos, A Study of the Ise- monogatari, 2 vols. (S'Gravenhage: Mouton, 1957) and Helen Craig McCullough, Tales of Ise: Lyrical Episodes from Tenth-Century Japan (Tokyo: University of Tokyo Press, 1968) com- bine translation with commentary and analysis; H. Jay Harris, The Tales of Ise (Tokyo: Tuttle, 1972) is a more straightforward exercise. 3 For other translations see in particular Vos, p. 165, who has the suggestion that what is being described after the first poem is the reaction of the women rather than the reasoning of the man, and Richard Okada, "Unbound Texts," pp. 82ff. It will be noticed that the transla- tion above follows Okada's experiment in using the historical present in an attempt to express the essential tenselessness of the original. For the argument that the agglutinative keri marks a presentational mode outside tense see pp. 35-36 of his thesis. As I have argued elsewhere (Murasaki Shikibu: The Tale of Genji, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 58-</page><page sequence="3">ISE MONOGATARI 403 As a single unit, this section is a repository for a whole series of "ac- tions" that subsequently became cultural norms: the passage from the center to the margins in search of experience, here involving travel back in time to the old Nara capital, which itself bears an aspect of lost innocence; the fact that there are two sisters to be discovered, giving the echo of a myth; the glimpse through a gap in the fence, kaimami f MA, an act which occurs in the Taketori monogatari, but which is here given the imprimatur as the sign of male recognition; the link between sexual awakening and obsession; and lastly, the control over that obsession exercised by the composi- tion of poetry that involves not only a judicious use of conceit and word-play, but also a good knowledge of the canon. The difficult ox- ymoron at the end, ichihayaki miyabi, which designates something like "violent [or impetuous] decorum," but which may well have more than a touch of Vos' "precocious refinement," has been the subject of much discussion as a potential key to the whole text, sug- gesting that the Ise is based on the principle that poetry is the mark of the civilized man. But there is more to the passage than this. The relationship of prose to poetry is also of major concern. The prose leads us to a poem which is a complex weave of words linking a pat- tern of cloth to secret longings; but the poem itself would not have been possible had the man not been wearing a particular pattern. So is the prose predicated on the poem or vice versa? The connection is one of true symbiosis. There then follows the comment on the nature and relevance of the man's actions. Everything is here: a distillation of the relation of poetry to passion, and of poetry to prose, with the added foretaste of the kind of commentary that such extreme compression automatically calls forth. The Ise monogatari that is read today is a collection of 125 such sec- tions, known as "measures" in Japanese, each section a combina- tion of prose and poem (209 poems in most standard versions). Each section forms a discrete entity and there is only a minimal at- tempt to link them together. Commentary is devoted not to hinging one section to the next but rather, as we have just seen, to self- analysis within the confines of one "measure." The following ex- tract, Section 6, is another example of this structuring: 59), the use of the English historical present has its own dangers, but the experiment will be continued throughout this essay.</page><page sequence="4">404 RICHARD BOWRING In the past, there is a man. For many years he has been courting a woman difficult of access. Eventually he steals her away and escapes in the pitch dark. As he leads her along a river called the Akutagawa, she asks him what the dew is on the grass. They have far to go and it is getting late. In the terrible thunder and pouring rain, the man, unaware that demons are in the vicinity, pushes the woman deep inside an abandoned storehouse and stands guard at the door with his bow and quiver. As he sits there hoping for dawn to come soon, a demon eats her up in one gulp. She cries out but he does not hear her above the thunder. Gradually dawn comes. When he looks inside, the woman he has brought is no longer there. He stamps his feet and wails but to no avail: "When she asked 'Is it jewels or what?,' I wish I had said 'dew' and just disappeared." This happens when the Nij6 Consort is in court service with her cousin, the Imperial Consort. She is extremely beautiful and so is stolen away and carried off on someone's back. Her brothers, the Horikawa Minister and Major Counselor Kunitsune, still minor officials at the time, happen to be on their way to the Palace when they hear someone crying piteously, so they stop the couple and take her back. They are the so-called demons. It all happens when she is still very young and only a commoner, or so they say. The poem, we think, came first. Then it was set into a context that was both abstract and fictional, in the sense that it is couched in terms of "the man" and "the woman." From one angle, the main aim of the context is to provide a situation in which a somewhat cryptic and difficult poem can be seen to make sense. But in the pro- cess, in a move that we shall come to recognize, the prose first of all gains parity with the poem and then threatens to overwhelm it and take center stage. But matters do not end there. As you read this section, the first thing that sticks out is in fact the oddity of the woman's question. Had she never seen dew before? Had she never been up so early in the morning? Or was it that she was in such a terrible state of fright that the slightest glimmer of something made her start and say "What's that!"? But in that case why go out of one's way to mention dew, as if it were of particular importance? Surely it only serves to bring us up short: it confuses the issue. Well yes, but dew had to be worked in somehow because it appears in the poem they were trying to handle. And so on and so on, until the mind is caught up in the literary mechanics. It is as if the text is specifically designed to lead the reader to pose questions about its structure and its meaning; and at considerable cost. But this is only the beginning. We also find that the combination of prose and poetry is commented on in turn with an interpretation that is down-to-earth, containing names, comments, and "explana-</page><page sequence="5">ISE MONOGATARI 405 tions. " The interesting thing about Section 6, of course, is that two entirely divergent interpretations of the same incident are merely juxtaposed and allowed to coexist. Together with the vagueness of reference in the majority of other sections, this willingness to let op- posites clash in the open is one of the more interesting aspects of this work. It has the effect of presenting us with not only the genesis of a poem but also the genesis of the phenomenon of variant stories itself. Then there is the question of whether we are actually dealing with a layered text. Can one perhaps discover an ur-text here and identify the different strata? Certainly, this is how most scholars view the matter today, and the general consensus is that the original was fairly sparse, devoid of names and identifications. The later ac- cretions are seen as editorial matter, attempts to defeat the original intention by providing those names and telling us what really hap- pened. Few, if any, ask whether the end result of such a stark and simple juxtaposition of conflicting texts is just a happy accident or whether we owe the interesting effect it produces to a very, very clever editor. The questions, the unanswerable questions, multiply. We shall return to Section 6 later, but it should already be clear that a series of such passages expressed in largely abstract terms with few obvious links creates a major problem, the problem of coher- ence; the history of the reception of the Ise is, by and large, a history of the various attempts to deal with this problem; to provide, create, or identify a principle of coherence that could be used to order a more satisfying reading. It is as if the text constantly aroused a sense of anxiety which forced the reader to work hard, to read it in as highly creative a manner as possible. It is probable that the first readers, those whose remarks now form part of the text through a process of accretion, were already anxious to reduce the open- endedness, already engaged in looking for the "real" story; the only thing that distinguishes them from later readers is that at some in- determinate point such comments were no longer simply absorbed into the flexible structure of the text but became nascent scholar- ship. The comment to Section 6 beginning "This happens. . would be seen not as a subtle addition by someone intent on reveal- ing the logic of the text, but merely as having been added by some- one who wanted to give a more satisfactory explanation for the presence of the demon. Not only does it attempt to explain away</page><page sequence="6">406 RICHARD BOWRING the supernatural, it also provides names and so begins to tie the text down in historical terms. We are still left with the problem of the juxtaposition, of course, but that seems to have mattered little to subsequent readers who used a series of such clues to create yet more coherence. In the search for such order, the first and most powerful clue is that thirty of the poems in the Ise also appear in the Kokinshu, with similar headnotes, all attributed to a specific courtier, Ariwara no Narihira At# (825-80). It is of course quite unclear whether or not the ur-Ise predates the Kokinshuz, and so it is not possible to say whether the former borrowed from the latter, or vice versa; or indeed whether they both drew from a third source, a putative "Narihira Collection. " The arguments are in any case inconclusive and not worth rehearsing here, although the theory of a joint source is perhaps the most likely. It is also likely that the Ise was first created about the same time or slightly later than the Kokinshui. To go any further at this stage would be in fact to anticipate our story, but it would appear that the "man" became identified as Narihira in all sections at a very early stage in the reading process. He became the "hero" of the whole work; despite the fact that only thirty poems could actually be attributed to him via the Kokinshzu and despite the fact that the Ise clearly contains poems that could have had no possible connection with Narihira, coming as they do from a variety of sources including both the Man 'yoshu and the Go- senshu *rA*.' Narihira is only mentioned by name once in the Ise itself, in Section 63, and this is normally assumed to be a sign of later editorializing. The first strategy, therefore, is to move in the direction of auto- biography. Or perhaps biography? No one is quite sure at this stage. Once this happens, by dint of linking certain key sections from various parts of the work, a core story emerges. It is the story of a courtier whom we first encounter having his first experience of sexual attraction while out hunting near Nara (Section 1). He then falls in love with Fujiwara no Takaiko ;i!q,-, who is intended by her family to be the future consort of the young Emperor Seiwa iTn 4 Some evidence here is provided by the variant titles. The Ise is called "Zaigo ga monogatari" VEbf*343 in the Genji and "Zaigo Chfij6 no nikki" CD1T1i:L1O H E in Sagoromo monogatari :AfJ-4, both being direct references to Narihira.</page><page sequence="7">ISE MONOGATARI 407 (Section 4). He manages to visit her in secret occasionally (Section 5) and in the end he tries to spirit her away (Section 6). He is then forced to leave the capital for some unstated reason and travel east (Section 7-9). The probable link between this "exile" and his affair with Takaiko is merely hinted at. While in the east he continues his frequent amorous poetic exchanges with women (Sections 10-15). On his return, he is then sent to Ise as an Imperial messenger and while there he misbehaves with the Ise Priestess 3i, who was of course supposed to remain unsullied (Section 69). Back in the area of the capital, he goes into service with Prince Koretaka ft, who had lost the succession to Seiwa (Section 82). In old age he com- poses a number of poems about his unhappy life and the story ends with his deati poem (Section 125). It is around this story that the rest of the sections of the Ise are seen to lie, if somewhat randomly. We know something else about Narihira from one other source, namely his death notice in the official chronicle Sandaijitsuroku E-0; .5 Born in 825, the fifth son of Prince Abo Hp 9, younger brother of Yukihira f , he was "elegant and handsome, self-indulgent and unrestrained, almost without (Chinese) learning but an excellent Japanese poet." He died in 880 at the age of 56. This description tallies to a certain extent with the image of the man in the Ise but gives us no proof for the story of transgression and exile. In much the same way that the abstract nature of the Ise prose style gives rise to analysis and commentary, the very transparency of the figure of Narihira that emerges from the text gives rise to a number of tales which will eventually take on a life of their own. The "mischief" is already present in the text itself: we find, for example, that two poems, one by Narihira and the other by Ono no Komachi 'JX;JJflT, that happen to lie next to each other in the Kokinshui as poems 622 and 623, appear in Section 25 of the Ise woven into a little love tale. It is on this basis, and no other, that there will later grow a legend that they were indeed lovers. It is precisely this kind of potential for expansion and elaboration that we shall be exploring in this study. But to return to the style of the work. The special concern of the Ise being the genesis of the poetry, it is often difficult to say whether 5 Sandaijitsuroku, the last of the official chronicles or Rikkokushi AI -, was completed in 901 and covered the three reigns of Seiwa (858-76), Y6zei MIbZ (876-84), and K6k6 )/C (884-87).</page><page sequence="8">408 RICHARD BOWRING the prose is present in the service of the poem or whether the poem is there to illustrate the end product of the events described in the prose. Ideally of course they should form a careful balance and for this to occur the prose must be pared down to its essentials. It is in fact prized for its spare quality. Section 4 is a good example: In the past, when the Ex-Empress is living in the eastern fifth-ward, a certain lady is occupying the west wing of the house. Quite without intending it a man falls deeply in love with the lady and begins to visit her; but around the tenth of the first month she moves away without a word and although he learns where she has gone, it is not a place where ordinary people can come and go. He can do nothing but brood over the wretchedness of life. When the plum blossoms are at their height in the next first month, poignant memories of the year before draw him back to her old apartments. He stares at the flowers from every conceivable standing and sitting position, but it is quite hopeless to recapture the past. Bursting into tears, he throws himself onto the floor of the bare room and lies there until the moon sinks low in the sky. As he thinks of the year before, he composes the poem: "Is it not the moon? Is not the spring the spring of old? Only my own being remains un- changed." He goes home at dawn, still weeping.6 Note how the prose shows a tendency to develop into narrative, only to be brought mercilessly to a full stop by the poem. The poem in its turn looks back towards the prose preface for its context; hence each section becomes a small self-inscribed circle. This section can be seen as another illustration of that moment when utagatari reveals the potential for monogatari, the moment when the desire to give a context to a poem gives way to a more detailed chronicle of its genesis. One glimpses the possibility that the context could become too powerful for the poem, burst its bounds, and become narrative. Here is in fact a classic example of that tension between poetry and prose, the restrictive versus the anarchic, that powers so much of Japanese literature. Section 4 in particular shows how dynam- ic that relationship can be. The prose is an interpretation of the poetry, so that ostensibly by the time we reach the poem we should have been set up: there should be only one possible reading. And yet when we reach the poem we find that it is difficult, difficult enough in fact to defeat the purpose of the prose. It proves too strong and continues to offer fertile ground for numerous interpreta- tions. It has been argued, quite rightly I think, that it is precisely 6 Adapted from Helen C. McCullough, Tales of Ise, p. 71.</page><page sequence="9">ISE MONOGATARI 409 this open quality of the text that has given the Ise its power and its ability to remain at the heart of the tradition for so long. It presents us with the kind of impersonalized environment that we are not to experience again until we reach the No. PICTURES INTO WORDS Before we move on, we need to ask the question as to where such spare prose comes from. What is the source of the initial dispersal of personality into empty signs that is such a marked characteristic of the Ise? One excellent candidate that has been suggested as at least a partial source is the somewhat unusual phenomenon of screen- poems, or by6buuta )R.I, that emerged in the late ninth century. Although the Imperial collections of Chinese poetry (chokushishIu *Jj1# X) in the early Heian do contain a few examples of daigashi , or Chinese poems written on or about paintings,7 the period most notable for by6buuta is somewhat later: in particular the years 880- 910. From what records we have, it would appear that at least in the early part of this period such poems were produced both in Chinese and in Japanese, as befits a time when the new kana and the re- surgent waka were beginning to challenge the status of Chinese in such works as Shinsen Man yoshuk VRX (893) and Kudai waka tPi TWhR (894). The best-known exponent of Chinese screen poems dur- ing these years was undoubtedly Sugawara no Michizane VAS and there are numerous examples in his collection Kanke buns6 7 V.8 As far as by5buuta are concerned, the reign and period of active 7 See in particular the poem by Emperor Saga M, about a landscape painted on a wall in the imperial residence, Keikokushu ut (827), book 13, Kochu Nihon bungaku taikei (Kokumin tosho kabushiki kaisha, 1927), 24.340-41. This poem is followed by three more written to harmonize with Saga's poem. A further set of two such poems by Saga and Yoshimine no Yasuo % can be found in Keikokushu, book 14, p. 320, but there are no other poems formally designated daigashi as such. It should be remembered, however, that the large number of poems on gardens and other set topics in the Ryounshu r (814), Bunka shuireishui Z;9 (ca. 818), and the later Honcho monzui *_WZ" bear witness to a tradi- tion of describing metaphorical landscapes that in fact differs very little from the description of paintings.

Items 386-90, dated 895, are of interest because of a preface that describes the preparation of screen paint-</page><page sequence="10">410 RICHARD BOWRING retirement of Emperor Uda 4 (r. 887-97; d. 931) saw a surge in popularity of screens and screen poems, an interest that continued on throughout the tenth century.9 The personal collections of poets such as Oshik6chi no Mitsune RIP W IR and Ki no Tsurayuki CRI A, for instance, are full of screen poems-70% and 65% respective- ly; so much so that together with poems written at utaawase t they seem to have formed the major type of Japanese poetry pro- duced during the years preceding and following the Kokinshul. Three poems from the Kokinshui can perhaps serve to illustrate the various ways in which such a poem might relate to a picture. The first one is by Sanjo no machi -J composed in the 850s: During the reign of Tamura [Montoku], the Emperor sees a painting on a screen in the women's quarters and says to the attendants: "I do like the cascade of the water- fall. Make it the tfopic of a poem": "Is it perhaps a waterfall of longing dammed up within? It seems to fall but no sound is heard." (Kokinshui 17: 930) Here a silent waterfall, itself a witty conceit, is transformed into a metaphor for the woman's own torrent of frustrated emotion; and yet at the same time the poem is not simply a poem composed on the topic "waterfall": the waterfall must be a painted one, and the poem cannot be divorced from the painting, for then we would lose the play on aesthetic distance that is part of its effect. We would also lose that subtle moment when, at the instant that the poem is born from the tension between painting and observer, it begins to exert ings based on Chinese texts, honmon byobu t For an examination of items 462-67 see Got6 Akio &amp;SM, "Sugawara no Michizane no Kon'in senzui s6ji no shi o megutte," Nihon bungaku 26.7 (July 1977): 55-66. 9 See Katano Tatsuro 6 ff -40, " By6buuta no kenkyu, " in Nihon bungei to kaiga no sokansei no kenkyu, Kasama sosho, vol. 56 (Kasama shoin, 1975), in particular the graph on p. 196 which is based largely on statistics culled from Ienaga Sabur6 Vj(_pM, Jodaiyamatoe nenpye. Note that there is still considerable disagreement as to whether picture or poetry came first. Later records suggest that the poetry was considered paramount (see Minamoto no Ienaga's Of: diary entry for Kennin 3(1203).11.23 which deals with the preparations of a screen and poems for Shunzei's 1&amp;JA 90th birthday celebrations) but information about the earlier period is sketchy. It would seem likely that at this stage the screens were produced first and then the poems composed on or about them.

If, as was quite often the case, this poem were later at- tached as a cartouche, it would become the title, and the painting would lose its innocence in the eyes of the Emperor; the lady-in- waiting would have succeeded in making it her own by the kind of poem she wrote. The second example is by Oshikochi no Mitsune and can be dated prior to 896. It is the fourth in a series of seven poems in- scribed on a screen depicting the four seasons that was used as a backdrop for the fortieth-year celebrations of Fujiwara no Sadakuni tp: "As the autumn winds blow through the pines at Suminoe, white waves rise in har- mony. (Kokinshui 7: 360) This example is far more descriptive, but in its attempt to capture the painting in words it adds both movement and sound, as if the static, spatial nature of the image were not enough. So successful is this substitution of word for image in fact that the picture disap- pears altogether; it is not really needed anymore because the poem has usurped its function. Hardly surprising therefore when one discovers that this poem also appeared in a poetry competition held some ten years prior to the date of this screen painting."0 The poet used it twice, and he was able to do this because the poem does not in and of itself demand a context that mentions a screen. In this sense it is self-sufficient and has proved to be too strong for the painting for there to be a fruitful matching. In the third example, also by Mitsune and composed about 900, we have yet another relationship explored: Submitted when the Emperor orders him to compose a poem on a screen painting in the Teiji Palace. A man about to cross a river has reined in his horse beneath a tree that is shedding its autumn leaves: "Let me stand and gaze before I cross; the autumn leaves fall like rain but the waters will not rise.""

" There is an alternative translation possible here. The first two lines might also be an apostrophe to the figure in the painting "stand and gaze before you cross!" but the version given is usually considered preferable.</page><page sequence="12">412 RICHARD BOWRING This time the poem is born not from an attempt to play with the space between observer and image, nor from a desire to reduce the space by active substitution; the space is annulled by the simple expedient of identifying with the figure in the painting and compos- ing from that point of view. As one might expect, the result is to de- emphasize the observer/poet and to push both poem and context in the direction of fiction. Of the three different kinds of interaction between word and im- age it is this last that proves to be of special interest in the present context: could it be that we have here some small clue as to the emergence of the Ise monogatari? Many of the so-called byJbuuta are lit- tle more than poems on given topics which happen to be connected to screen paintings, but occasionally there are one or two that have interesting possibilities: the following is to be found in Tsurayuki's personal collection: A group of men and women are sitting beneath the trees and someone is crossing in a boat; he is pointing and seems to be saying something. The impression is that he has just heard a cuckoo: "Row over there, quick over there! I want to tell them a cuckoo called while I was on my way.""2 Here the poem involves a transference of focus into the figure, and the connection (or should we say opposition) between poem and headnote is similar to that in Mitsune's poem quoted above. The poem asserts its authority over the painting in its aspect as inter- pretation but still needs the explanation in the headnote to make sense. The fragile tie between context and poem remains intact. It is of course of major importance to find that Tsurayuki pro- duced so many screen poems in his professional capacity, for he is known not only as the chief compiler of the Kokinshuk but also as the author of the Tosa nikki, one of the first prose works to use the new kana. As is well known, it also involved him in assuming the per- sona of a female writer, a piece of role-playing that brought him a step closer to fully-fledged fiction. Link this to a proven willingness to become figure-in-the-painting, and we begin to glimpse how the abstract Ise style might have developed. It is perhaps worth mention- ing here that some scholars see Tsurayuki as the best candidate for 12 "Tsurayuki zenkashu, " poem 460, in Hagitani Boku, ed., Tosa nikki, Nihon koten zensho (Asahi shinbunsha, 1950), p. 202.</page><page sequence="13">ISE MONOGATARI 413 the authorship of the Ise itself, for precisely this reason. There is another figure who played a prominent part in the development of screen poems: Lady Ise fzIODM (b. 872?), so called because her father, Fujiwara no Tsugukage 51,7M, once held the post of Governor of Ise. She served in the entourage of Empress Onshi M- from 888-907 and later became the favorite mistress of Emperor Uda in his retirement. She has more poems in the Kokinshui than any other female poet and her reputation must have clearly lasted, for her poems are also prominent in both the Gosenshui and the Shulishuii Iii. Her personal poetry collection, the Ise shu/, begins with thirty-three poems which are stitched together with prose in the form of a rudimentary narrative that reads like fiction. This opening section, which has been given the name "Ise nikki,'"l3 has the tell-tale pattern of "otoko" and "onna" in lieu of names. It is followed in the collection by a large number of screen poems linked to the practice known as utagatari, or poem-telling. Japanese poetry has always been poetry in search of a context, so much so that when poems "lost" their original setting or were perhaps orphans from the very beginning, the habit arose of giving them fictional settings. Among court women this became a pastime and Lady Ise's collec- tion is rich in this kind of material. This particular set of eighteen poems opens with the following headnote: Some screen poems that the former Empress, when she was still known as the Crown Prince's Consort, had us compose on specific topics. I was to imagine a man using plum blossoms as a pretext for making advances. The picture on the first screen was of the man meeting a woman and making overtures. The man: "Thinking to meet again the one I saw, not one day passes when I do not come to where the plum blossoms bloomed." And as the reply: "They are plum blossoms that you abandoned after one short visit, and so you may hear that they have scat- tered, but you cannot possibly want to see them now."" This first exchange leads into a love sequence which stretches over the next sixteen poems, beginning in spring and ending, fittingly, in winter. The marriage of love sequences with the progression of the seasons is now becoming firmly established. 13 See Akiyama Ken tkLLL*, "Ise nikki kai f H g," in Ochojoryui bungaku no keisei, Hanawa sensho, vol. 57 (Hanawa shob6, 1967), pp. 71-169. 14 Shinpen kokka taikan (Kadokawa shoten, 1984), 3.46.

Immediately following this group in the Ise shu, we have a set devoted to the famous tragic beauty Yang Gueifei $Alae, the very poems to which Murasaki Shikibu VAN refers in the first chapter of the Genji monogatari.'5 "A screen of the 'Song of Everlasting Sorrow' was produced on the Ex-Emperor's orders and he had me compose poems for various sections." Five poems are written from the point of view of the Chinese Emperor, followed by five from that of Yang Gueifei. Lady Ise herself turns up again in Sections 1 and 147 of the Yamato monogatari which, as we shall see later, is connected closely to Uda's cultural circle. In Section 147, after a passage which describes the legend of Ikutagawa, in which a girl drowns herself in despair at being unable to choose between two suitors, we come across the following: This event of long ago is depicted in detail on a painting that is then presented to the Late Empress. Everyone present imagines themselves as one of the figures in the painting and composes a set of poems. Lady Ise, as one of the men, writes: "Only as a form do I see you below the waters; a body without a soul is of little worth." Then in the role of the woman, the First Princess writes: "My soul sunk deep beneath the waters, can it be seen by someone now afloat/frivolous?" Lady Ise is obviously an important figure in the process by which utagatari was linked to screens to create the embryo of an illustrated tale. Whether she has anything to do with the Ise monogatari itself is a matter that we shall take up in due course, but it is important to note that this utagatari is remarkable for its use of abstract terms such as "the man" and "the woman.'" We have no way of knowing for certain, but it may well be that the Ise developed from utagatari based on pictures. One small clue that remains as a possible rem- nant of this process is Section 106, where the prose reads: "A cer- tain man, off on an excursion with some imperial princes, composes this poem on a bank of the Tatsuta River. " The same poem occurs as Kokinshut 5: 294 with a rather different headnote: "Composed 15 "He had become addicted to illustrations by the emperor Uda for 'The Song of Everlasting Sorrow' and to poems by Ise and Tsurayuki on the subject."

Topic set: a folding screen picture of autumn leaves floating on the Tatsuta River. By Narihira. " TURNING COMMENTARY INTO TEXT Of the six sections in the Yamato monogatari (ca. 950-70) that are clearly related to the Ise (149 and 161-65), episode 161 is the most interesting for what it can tell us about the essential difference between these texts: Zai Chfijo, in the days when the Nijo Consort is still a commoner and not yet in the service of the Emperor, presses his suit with her. Sending her something called bedding seaweed, he writes: "If there be love, come let us sleep together in a des- olate hut, even though our sleeves be the only bedding." Her reply people have forgotten! Now then, the Consort becomes known as the mother of the Crown Prince and goes on a pilgrimage to Oharano. She is accompanied by a large retinue of nobles and courtiers. Zai Chfijo is among them. He stands by her carriage in the gather- ing dusk, after she has already bestowed gifts on everyone at the shrine. From the back of her carriage she presents him with an unlined robe that she has been wear- ing. Zai Chiujo, upon receiving it, replies in secret: "On such an auspicious day, Mount Oshio at Ohara too must surely recall what happened in the Age of the Gods." She remembers the past and is entranced.16 Although it looks as if two distinct Ise passages (3 and 76, for which see below) have been conflated, we must be wary of thinking ex- clusively in terms of one text being prior to another. While it is prob- ably fair to say that the "abstract" Ise was followed by the more "concrete" Yamato and hence identify a kind of evolutionary pat- tern, it is also true that the Kokinshui was interested in poet's names and the details of a poem's context. "On such an auspicious day," for example, occurs in the Kokinshu- as poem 17: 871 with the head- note: "Composed on a day when the Nijo Consort, when she was still known as the Crown Prince's mother, went on a pilgrimage to Oharano. By Narihira no Ason." and it is this kind of headnote that, more than anything else, allowed Narihira to be linked to 16 The poem refers to the fact that the Fujiwara clan deity, Amenokoyane no Mikoto i ;iP was said to have accompanied the ancestor of the Imperial family when he first descended to earth in Kyushu. The secondary meaning, which is picked up immediately by the Nij6 Consort, is "surely you too must recall events of long ago!"</page><page sequence="16">416 RICHARD BOWRING Takaiko in the poetic mind. It seems more sensible, therefore, to look for differing intentions and designs rather than claim that the Yamato is making specific use of the Ise. The relevant sections in the Yamato are an example of a different approach to similar material, a different attitude to the phenomenon of contexts. The Ise passages in question are: Section 3. In the past, there is a man. To the home of a woman who preys on his mind he sends something called bedding seaweed: "If there be love, come let us sleep somewhere in a desolate hut, even though our sleeves be the only bedding." This is when the Nijo Consort is still a commoner and not yet in the Emperor's ser- vice. Section 76. In the past, when the Nijo Consort is still known as the Crown Prince's mother, she goes on a pilgrimage to the clan shrine. After everyone has been given gifts, one old man serving in the Palace Guards receives his gift from the back of her car- riage. He replies by composing: "On such an auspicious. day, Mount Oshio at Ohara too must surely recall what happened in the Age of the Gods. " Does he re- ally feel sad? How does he feel? No one knows.17 As we have already pointed out, the tendency to identify, to name and tie down figures is discernible in the later layers of the Ise itself. Section 3 here is a case in point. The final comment appears as an afterthought only half-digested, written in a different key. The Yamato however goes much further than this, identifies the man as Narihira from the outset, turns the material inside out and transforms commentary into text; and as this poem does not occur in the Kokinshu, the only justification for seeing Narihira as the man involved is the presence of the Nij6 Consort. We have entered a nice little hermeneutic circle. It is precisely this strategy that then allows this section to be linked to Section 76, which we "know" from the headnote to the identical poem in the Kokinshu, 17: 871, to involve Narihira. This naming of the nameless, this grounding of the text in historical time and place is the distinguishing characteristic of the Yamato. It is also one of the reasons why, to the connoisseur, the 17 Most commentators take the "old man" to be the subject of these last remarks although, as we have just seen in the Yamato monogatari passage, they could just as easily be attributed to the Nij6 Consort. For the latter interpretation see the translation by McCullough, Tales of Ise, pp. 121 and 233-34.</page><page sequence="17">ISE MONOGATARI 417 Yamato is infinitely less interesting than the Ise: it operates in an enclosed space from the outset, has less possibilities, and imposes its facticity upon the reader. The Yamato is, in contrast to the Ise, a "safe" text. Identifying poets and occasions is a way of making the private public, of transmitting it into common memory so that it becomes both legitimate and significant; but in aesthetic terms all it manages to do is trivialize the material. The usual range of dates given for the completion of the Yamato is 950-70, but the world of the work is essentially that of Retired Emperor Uda (r. 887-97; d. 931). It looks back to his time as the age when waka was resuscitated and the groundwork laid for the Kokinshui. If the Kokinshut was dedicated to inventing and defining a canon as part of an attempt to secure cultural hegemony, and the Ise was dedicatect to exploring the process of poetic creation itself, the Yamato invents a tradition of waka composition in social and historical terms. This does much to explain its explicitness. It re- cords poems in such a fashion that the circumstances of their pro- duction become part of cultural memory, become just as much cultural fact as the poems themselves. Although this form of legitimization by creating a "lore" of waka has much in common with the aims of compiling an imperial an- thology, the Yamato has its own special and somewhat marginalized constituency. The Fujiwara, for instance, are remarkable by their absence, and it is possible to argue that this work was actually com- piled in opposition to the Gosenshui (951), which in turn differs so radically from the Kokinshu/ in the emphasis on rank and power, sometimes at the expense of poetic ability. If there is one theme that can be said to characterize the collection of anecdotes that is the Yamato, it would be that of isolation and of ill-concealed discontent with being on the margins. It opens with the retirement of the Emperor Uda. Surrounding himself with poets and talented women, he managed to create an artistic milieu in which poetry competitions and banquets became major cultural events, and the Yamato can be seen as an attempt to give this de- politicized world major cultural status. But what actually happens is that the emphasis shifts onto the less happy aspects of this thirty- odd-year self-imposed political exile. There is much talk of failing to win promotions, of parting, of death, and of the general failure to</page><page sequence="18">418 RICHARD BOWRING communicate, as if the lore of waka is fated to be linked indissolubly to the margins rather than to the center. The tone of the longer sections nearer the end is one of almost uniform melancholy: "Ikutagawa" (147), "Ashikari"(148), and "Obasuteyama"(156) containing that element of tragedy that will enable them to become sources for N6 plays in the Muromachi; and the passages that deal with Heichui T1+ reveal an archetypal failure in love. As a domesticated form of Narihira, Heichuf is no threat to the system; his presence in the Yamato perhaps symbolic of its limitations. It is in such a context of creating a lore that the phenomenon of utagatari is best understood. Utagatari is the production of a context for a poem and as such is a very powerful interpretative strategy. The poem, which exists in its own realm of rhetorical tropes and figures, is a highly restricted form that engenders a multiplicity of meanings; the production of a context is an attempt to bind down the poem and delineate certain boundaries, an act of authority that is necessarily reductive in its effect. This implicit restrictiveness is seen operating on a larger level in the Yamato when one encounters phrases such as "kotobito no akaredo yokaranu wa wasurenikeri" (There were many poems by the others but the uninteresting ones have been forgotten) where "forgotten" really means "ignored." The implication is that the compiler knows best. There is one other interesting effect to be observed here. In the act of creating poetic lore, poetry itself becomes subordinated to prose. Contextualization here presupposes that the poem cannot stand on its own but must be supplemented; and in the Yamato the supplementation itself becomes the main object of care and atten- tion. It is usually recognized that from Section 141 onwards the tone of the collection changes and the balance shifts markedly from uta to katari. When poetry becomes the object of historical interest it yields ground to its own commentary. Indeed we have in the Yamato an ex- traordinary documentation of the shift from poetry to prose that oc- curred in this era. It happens before one's very eyes as one reads into the later sections, and it is in these sections that we find those passages that are most closely allied to the now burgeoning legend of Narihira. The desire to legitimize poetry here leads to its displace- ment, as the Yamato takes up where the Kokinshui left off and ties the poems irrevocably to the developing story of Narihira himself. In</page><page sequence="19">ISE MONOGATARI 419 such a milieu, the abstract self-analytical style of the Ise itself begins to look very much the odd man out. BIOGRAPHY OF A HERO By the time we reach the Genji monogatari in about 1010 the pro- cess by which the "man" becomes identified with Narihira has been all but completed and it is clear that he has already taken on many of those aspects of the cultural hero that will characterize his role henceforth. The Ise too has become a touchstone full of arche- typal scenes, and its presence in the Genji is so all-pervasive that it may seem stretching a point to isolate specific instances. The dispos- sessed prince, the sexual transgression with an imperial concubine, the self-inflicted exile, and the link between poetry and sexuality: they all lie like shadows behind this peak of Heian literature. Allu- sions abound: the "Suma" chapter contains reference to the poem in Section 7 of the Ise, where the man is traveling east on his exile; and the central image of Chapter 25, "Hotaru," where Genji re- leases fireflies into Tamakazura's room so that a prince might see and be possessed, is an acting out of Ise Section 39. There is, however, one direct reference: in "Eawase. " Although it might seem on the surface that we are involved in a picture contest, the kind of arguments made in the process of judging make it clear that what is really at stake here are the relative merits of the stories that have been illustrated; and underneath it all Fuji- tsubo is playing hard politics. The Ise, pitted againstJosanmi EL-fR, is praised first by a lady-in-waiting in terms of the hero: "But should we ever malign the name of Narihira?" When it appears that a stalemate has been reached and a draw is in the offing, the final decision in favor of the Ise is made by Fujitsubo, who inter- venes to echo the previous statement: "How could we ever malign the name of Narihira! " Given what we know to be her relationship with Genji, such an open statement in favor of the rebel Narihira is fraught with danger. Not only is Fujitsubo in the midst of a very delicate political game of getting the right girl married to her son (who is of course the result of her union with Genji), but she is also fully aware of what Narihira signifies: the sexual hero driven by the Fujiwara to atone for transgressing "imperial" prerogative by</page><page sequence="20">420 RICHARD BOWRING being banished to the margins. It is perhaps a sign of her desperate ambition that she allows herself to express such a dangerous prefer- ence for a fictional hero who prefigures Genji in so many ways. This is by no means the first use of the Ise in the Genji, but it is one of the more obvious. For a subtler presence we must look to Chapter 5. The title of this chapter, "Wakamurasaki," draws attention to itself. It is usual for a Genji chapter title to be a word or phrase taken from a poem in the text, but in this case the reference leads the reader away from the text and back to Ise Section 1 where the word "wakamurasaki" ("Ah young purple fern of Kasugano") first ap- pears in the classical canon. The "Wakamurasaki" chapter mirrors Section 1 in numerous ways: the initial trip into the country where a crucial discovery of a hidden gem is to occur, the discovery itself presented in terms of a kaimami, and the act of poetic creation tied to the onset of sexual maturity. But it is possible to extract an even subtler presence. The first exchange of poems in this chapter, between the nun and the lady- in-waiting, concerning young Murasaki's extreme youth and the total inappropriateness of Genji's request to take her away, contains the two words "wakakusa" (tender grasses) and "hatsukusa" (first grasses). These words recall a somewhat similar exchange in Ise Sec- tion 49, a section that is famous because it appears to deal with the incestuous love of a brother for a younger sister. Given the classical status of the Ise by this time, it is quite possible that Murasaki Shikibu is here referring to the nature of Genji's passion for Fuji- tsubo, with whom, incidentally, he will sleep a little further on in the same chapter. Genji unconsciously reveals the psychological stress he is under in his identification and substitution of Murasaki for Fujitsubo (and Fujitsubo for Kiritsubo) by using vocabulary that it- self contains incestuous overtones when read in the light of the Ise. 8 The evidence for Murasaki Shikibu's acute awareness of the potential of the Ise as a powerful precursor is overwhelming. For our immedi- ate purposes the important point is that, as the most sophisticated 18 See Mitani Kuniaki - 13 , "Fujitsubo jiken no hy6gen k6z6," in Imai Takuji Hakase koki kinen: monogatari, nikki bungaku to sono shuffhen (Ofusha, 1980), pp. 275-300. Note that Murasaki Shikibu was to use the incestuous overtones of Section 49 again much later in Chapter 47 "Agemaki," where Niou makes certain advances towards his sister that she finds uncomfortable. Seidensticker, p. 857.</page><page sequence="21">ISE MONOGATARI 421 reader of her age, she worked under the assumption that the Ise was the biography of Narihira; whether or not this was being faithful to the originators of the text, it was to prove an extremely productive strategy. THE POLITICAL DIMENSION Apart from a short passage in the Eiga monogatari E (ca. 1030?), mentioning Narihira's involvement with the priestess at Ise,19 the next important reference is in the Okagami Ai, (ca. 1090?). Here we are on very different ground indeed. Although the Okagami lies at the end of the Heian period and is often seen as the last work of Heian prose. in many respects it represents a new beginning. We do not know who wrote it, but everything about it suggests male authorship: it can be seen as the successful culmination of the at- tempt to wrest Japanese prose away from female and back into male hands that had begun as early as 935 with Tsurayuki's Tosa nikki. Male authorship is indeed the best and perhaps the only explana- tion for the new narrative technique that we find here, a technique which can only be described as retrograde. The Okagami gives us an elaborately drawn frame in which the historical and anecdotal material is presented in dialogue form. Although there are occasions where this pattern gives rise to a certain amount of disputation,20 this is not the prime reason for its existence. It is a sign that we have regressed to a somewhat raw story-telling style, a colloquial style with a liberal sprinkling of those sentence particles that indicate degrees of emphasis and give us the feel of actual speech. But why is this paraphernalia of the frame needed at all? Why introduce a transparent narrator who goes by the near-parodic name of Oyake Yotsugi 1Itt4 (Mr. Chronicle the Official) when he appears to carry a narrative that has no need for him? The answer can only lie in the problem of belief. In the female world, the Genji and the later Eiga monogatari prove to us that the problem of belief in narrative 19 See Helen Craig and William H. McCullough, trans., A Tale of Flowering Fortunes (Stan- ford: Stanford University Press, 1980), p. 452. 20 For instance in Morotada's RTJIV (also read Moromasa) biography. It is certainly possi- ble to see the dialogue format of the Okagami as the progenitor of what came to be the norm for disputations (ron A) in the Kamakura period and beyond, or perhaps as a link between Kiikai's _ Sango shiiki -i,'R and these later scholarly works.</page><page sequence="22">422 RICHARD BOWRING has been solved and that such naive gestures towards a real-life communicative situation are no longer needed; but clearly in the male world this was still a problem. This particular arena was still dominated by classical Chinese. Here, in the Okagami, the first real attempt at a male history since the Sandaijitsuroku of 901, we have to go through the invention of belief de novo, because for the first time native Japanese prose is being used where Chinese would be ex- pected; hence the elaborate structure of a dialogic situation linked to a colloquial style. The illusion of reportage is to be the guarantee of the work's truth. In the case of the Okagami, the highly committed nature of its ideology made the creation of such an illusion of crucial impor- tance. The use of the mirror as metaphor appears not only in the ti- tle, but also in a key passage that lies between the Imperial Annals and the sections devoted to individual Fujiwara figures: Your descriptions of all those Emperors have been just like reflections in a mirror. Now that you are going to tell us about the ministers too, I feel like a man witness- ing a glorious sunrise after years in the dark. My wife's mirror at home is terribly cloudy, and we never get around to polishing it, so she keeps it in her comb box, and we have learned to manage with nothing better. When I listen to you, I feel as I do when I catch a glimpse of my face in a bright, shiny mirror-it's embarrassing to see what I really look like, but the reflection is amazingly true to life.21 This passage is followed by two poems that dilate on the clarity of mirrors in which the past, the present, and even the future can be clearly seen. The mirror is another guarantee of lack of bias, for it shows the past as a true replica, warts and all, and the clearer the mirror, the clearer the account and the more truthful the picture. There is also the implicit suggestion that private records, like mir- rors, are less trustworthy than public ones. The audience's attention is, of course, being directed away from what is in fact powerful ideological intent. "How can I explain Michinaga's success without discussing the Emperors and Em- presses who made it possible? A garden tree won't grow and bear fruit unless we feed its roots and take good care of it," the narrator tells his audience just before the preceding passage. The metaphor 21 Tachibana Kenji ffZ I, ed., Okagami, NKBZ 20.72-73. Translation from Helen Craig McCullough, trans., Okagami: The Great Mirror (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980), p. 85.</page><page sequence="23">ISE MONOGATARI 423 of organic growth, which might normally bring with it the sugges- tion of naturalness but which the preface to the Kokinshul has taught us to associate with language's relation to reality, is here smuggled in to suggest inevitability. The author clearly needs to hide his com- mitment to the validity of the Fujiwara mode of operation: politics in all the admirable ruthlessness of its greatest practitioners. Far from being the "roots," the Emperors are merely of secondary in- terest. "I ought to discuss each of them in turn, from EmperorJin- mu on"22 says the storyteller, but in fact we begin with Montoku S: Pci. Why? Because Montoku had a Fujiwara mother, and the story of Fujiwara success is here traced back to Fuyutsugu's ?-! political astuteness during his reign. The other ideological presupposition here is that outstanding in- dividuals make history. By choosing to represent the past in the form of collected biographies rather than a chronicle, the author manages to make each Fujiwara stand out in bold relief. The aim of the narrative is to fix the image of each man in turn, to which end anecdotes and poems are used as convenient markers. Identity, if it is to be memorable, must be tied or tagged to a story or a quirk of behavior. Everything is subordinated to the political imperative. The ability to fart is given political significance in the struggle between Michizane and Tokihira (incidentally showing how the Okagami differs radically from the Konjaku monogatarishu/ in its use of such anecdotes)23 and poetry is used not for its cultural significance as in the Yamato monogatari, but as a mnemonic to help fix events of political importance in the reader's mind. What the biographical ap- proach does not do, however, is give us a coherent sense of event, because event is fragmented into personality, from which it then draws its significance. Any attempt to impose the order of cause and effect here would have militated against the underlying ideology, the cult of the Fujiwaras as individuals. This is why, despite the loca- tion of the whole frame in a Buddhist temple, the "sermon" actual- ly presented to the reader turns out to be profoundly secular with hardly a whiff of mappo T1A about it. If the work was indeed written about 1090, then this must have been a conscious decision. So why does the Ise appear in the Okagami and what role does it 22 McCullough, Okagami, p. 69. 23 McCullough, Okagami, p. 103.</page><page sequence="24">424 RICHARD BOWRING play? It comes as no surprise to find that the relationship between Narihira and Takaiko takes center stage. The first reference comes in the very first annal, that of Emperor Montoku: She (Fujiwarajunshi )10fT, Montoku's mother) it was who was known as the Gojo Consort. It was about her residence that Middle Captain Narihira wrote in the Ise monogatari: "Would that he might fall asleep every night." And also "The spring of old" [refers to the same events it seems. How it was I'm not too sure, but I did hear that it happened when he was paying court to the Nij6 Consort. "The spring of old" has the headnote "In the household of the Goj6 Consort." Being very close, she was brought up in that household and so was there in the same place, I suppose. ]24 Here we have a conflation of Ise Section 5 (Kokinshul 632) and Ise Sec- tion 4 (Kokinshul 747). Given that both the Ise and the Kokinshuk head- note mention "the household of the Goj6 Consort," this linking is only to be expected. But why Narihira in the first place? Because in the context of the Okagami, Narihira represents the first major threat to the Fujiwara and he is in turn their first victim. By carrying off Takaiko when he did, he nearly ruined their carefully laid plans for domination of the throne through marriage: Yoshifusa A- was waiting for Seiwa to reach puberty before installing Takaiko, his niece and adopted daughter, as a junior consort. Narihira's banish- ment was undoubtedly orchestrated by the Fujiwara themselves. So why bother to give Narihira any space in the Okagami at all? Is it just to illustrate an early Fujiwara success? Perhaps, but there is surely more. As we have seen, by the time of the Okagami Narihira had already become a legend: he could not be ignored, precisely because his status as a cultural hero was now rapidly growing. Within the political horizons of the Okagami, he represented in his time a far greater threat than either the Masakado or Sumitomo uprisings, and this is why he is mentioned and they are not. His potential for disruption had been far greater, hence he had to be mentioned, subsumed and then neutralized. The Okagami is in fact an attempt to demystify his image and render it powerless. Mention of him is restricted to the Imperial annals, as if to bolster the fiction that his crime had been one of lese majeste rather than of threaten- 24 This last passage in parentheses does not appear in the major textual lines of the Okagami and has been added from a variant text held in the Kyushu University Library.

So we now find that the story that is seen to lie behind Sections 4-9 of the Ise has become a tale of tremendous significance. The commentaries that lay in one of the secondary "layers" have now become the meaning of the work itself. One recent view of the genesis of the Ise has it that the core may well have originated in Narihira's own time among a group of like- minded dispossessed aristocrats to whom the business of defining cultural and aesthetic norms was a fair substitute for the real power they had lost.25 In the later sections of the Ise we come across the following marginalized figures: Minamoto no T6ru 09,9i, Ki no Ari- tsune C*V, Prince Koretaka and Prince Sadakazu At. Narihira himself was, in a sense, a dispossessed prince because of his grand- KANMU so 51 52 53 Kusuko HEIZEI SAGA JUNNA Fuyutsugu I I I 54 - 141 1 Abo Toru Sadame NINMY -Junshi Yoshifusa Na ara Aritsune 1Ko1o58 Yukihira Narihira -Daughter Seish MONTOKU{Meishi Ayako | [ t SEIWA -Koshi Mototsune l Kunitsune Sadakazu Yasuko Koretaka YZEI 57 Shitago UDA Ise genealogy Numbers refer to Emperors in chronological order. 25 See in particular Watanabe Minoru iZ1, "Minamoto no T6ru to Ise monogatari, " Kokugo to kokubungaku 585 (Nov. 1972): 1-12 and the "kaisetsu" to his edition of the Ise monogatari in the Shincho Nihon koten shiusei series.</page><page sequence="26">426 RICHARD BOWRING father's defeat at the hands of Saga ZR, and those with whom he mixed were all men who gradually found themselves slipping fur- ther and further away from power as time went by (see genealogical chart). It will be argued later that the Ise we have today may well have been created in the entourage of the retired Emperor Uda, but there are certainly good grounds for supposing that it probably ex- isted in some form or other much earlier, and if it had originated in such a group during Narihira's lifetime, this might partially explain the cryptic style. It is this background that helps to explain the precise nature of the second reference in the Okagami, which occurs only a few pages later, in the annal of Emperor Yozei MM. It is more complex than the first and conflates no less than four sections (Ise 6, 12, 76, and 99) while continuing to concentrate on the same central episode: (Emperor Y6zei's) mother was nine years senior to the Emperor Seiwa.... It is unclear how she first came to serve at court. She was the woman who, while she was still living at home in seclusion, was carried off in secret by the Ariwara Middle Captain; he hid her, and her brothers, Minister of State Mototsune Af and Ma- jor Counselor Kunitsune PM (it must have been when they were very young), went to fetch her back, whereupon he composed the poem: "my beloved is hidden here and so am I. " In later years they say he composed the poem "what happened in the Age of the Gods. " It would seem, then, that she did not become an Imperial Consort in the manner usual for carefully reared young women. One is driven to the conclusion that the Emperor met her while she was visiting the Somedono Con- sort (Meishi M-#), from whom she was inseparable. It is presumptuous for a nobody like myself to discuss such matters, but then it is all common knowledge. Can there be anyone today who has not read the Kokinshui and the Ise monogatari? I have also heard that the poem "neither unseen nor quite seen" was composed during this same affair. When you think of the poems he be- queathed to posterity, he really was a frightful womanizer. Ah, how much more elegant and interesting things were back then. . . . She was the lady known as the Nijo Consort.26 Section 6, which has no counterpart in the Kokinshu, is the famous "Akutagawa" section that has inspired so many illustrations and that we have already discussed in some detail (see trans. on p. 404). It is introduced at this point not only because it describes the crucial abduction scene, but also because it makes specific reference to Fujiwara no Mototsune, who will appear again with his own 26 Tachibana Kenji, ed., Okagami, p. 47; McCullough, Okagami, pp. 72-73 (adapted).</page><page sequence="27">ISE MONO GA TARI 427 biography later on in the Okagami. Mototsune was the man who eventually decided that his nephew Yozei was unfit to rule, forced him to abdicate, and replaced him with Koko Y64 in 884. It is possi- ble that a further effect of this Narihira episode is to discredit Yozei here by casting doubts on the morality of his mother, the Nij6 Con- sort. Certainly, compared to the Yamato monogatari, there can be no doubt that we are on highly charged ground, and that Narihira is be- ing used for the political significance of his actions. Sections 76 ("what happened in the Age of the Gods," see trans. on p. 416) and 9927 are perhaps brought in here to give us a sense of spanning the whole of Narihira's life, but they also emphasize the depth of a passion that lasted, against all odds, into old age. But this small gesture is, typically for the Okagami, immediately offset by an ironic reference to Na-rihira as poet and lover extraordinaire. Clearly, seeing the Ise as a biography was by now a common ploy, but such is the nature of the work that one has to play fast and loose with the text to produce even this limited degree of coherence. Sec- tion 12, for instance, goes as follows: In the past, there is a man who steals someone's daughter. On his way to Musashino with her, he is arrested for theft by some provincial officials. He leaves the girl in a clump of bushes and runs off. His pursuers feel certain that he is on the plain, and prepare to set fire to it. In distress the girl recites: "Do not set fire today to Musashino; my beloved is hidden here and so am I. " They hear the poem, seize the girl, and march the two of them off. This can only be linked to Section 6 if two things are done: a) if the poem is put into the mouth of the man rather than the woman (and there is no justification for this in the text except for the fact that the word tsuma "beloved" may refer to either sex) and b) if "Musashino wa" is rejected in favor of "Kasugano wa," the reading that appears in the Kokinshuk version of this poem, namely Kokinshui 1: 17. "Musashino wa" is geographically a highly unlikely place name in the circumstances, whereas Kasugano is south of 27 Section 99: In the past, on the day of an archery meet at the :iding grounds of the Imperial Guards of the Right, a certain Middle Captain glimpses a lady's face through the silk curtains of a carriage opposite. He sends her this poem: "Longing for someone, neither unseen nor quite seen, shall I spend this day lost in foolish reverie?"

It is this kind of strong reading that was to lead to the wholesale metaphorical interpreta- tion of certain sections of the Ise that we shall see emerging in the Kamakura. SEARCHING FOR COHERENCE It is in the Kamakura Period that we first encounter full-length commentaries to the Ise. This marks the birth of scholarship in the sense that commentary is clearly demarcated from text proper; the initial fluidity has hardened in the process of canonization. Despite considerable disagreements over particulars, disagreements substan- tial enough to-spawn the secret traditions of reading for which the chusei is notorious, the commentaries by and large share the same preconceived ideas as to what a commentary should provide; and the attitudes and opinions enshrined in these works proved to be ex- tremely influential right down through the Tokugawa. The search for coherence took various forms but centered on the resolution of certain key problems, which remain "problems" to this very day. How, for instance, was one to handle the question of the large number of significantly differing textual variants? We know that by the late Heian the number of textual lines was already a matter for comment and concern. The earliest scholars who busied themselves with collating and editing the Ise with a critical eye were Fujiwara no Teika t* and the priest Kensh6 MM (1 130- ca. 1210). In the Kokinshul commentary, Kokinshul chui -NI, Ken- sho mentions not only a putative original in Narihira's hand, which (if it ever existed) was already lost, but also two other types of text: those that had the present order, and a shorter and rarer group that began with present Section 69 and ended with present Section 11. No specific comments along these lines are available from Teika, but here and there in the Kamakura commentaries one comes across signs that anything from three to seven distinct textual lines were recognized. Teika busied himself with collating his own edi- tion and the most reliable texts in use today are traced back to his work. The present situation, however, is still extremely complex and every Ise scholar has his own system of dividing up the plethora of texts into manageable lineages. A simplified picture follows:</page><page sequence="29">ISE MONOGATARI 429 A. Those texts that begin with present Section 1. These can be divid- ed into: (i) Those Teika texts now in common use, with 125 sections. This includes the anomalous set of texts written in manJyJgana, which used to be seen as the original by certain Tokugawa scholars but which are first mentioned in the mid-fourteenth-century Genji com- mentary Kakaishoo iXtJP and which are now seen as medieval exer- cises in antiquarianism. (ii) Those texts that are longer than 125 sections and which often differ quite markedly from (i), especially in the second half. It is thought that these may go back to the labors of Kensho. (iii) Those texts that are abridged, being on average only 115 sec- tions long. B. Those texts that Kensh6 mentioned as beginning with present Section 69, widely known as the "Imperial Huntsman" group. No exemplar of this group survives intact, although fragments remain, and copies seem to have existed in Kensho's time. This group is im- portant because it figures in medieval commentaries, seems to have been considerably shorter, and may well have presented a clearer biographical framework for Narihira. This last supposition is sup- ported by the existence of another odd-man-out: the text belonging to what is known as the "Ihon Ise monogatari emaki," a picture scroll that will be discussed later. Although this illustrated scroll does not end with Section 11, it does begin with Section 69 and presents a mere eighteeen of the present Ise sections in the form of a unified narrative. Although it is doubtful whether Teika and Kensho were faced with quite the same problems we have today, there can be no doubt that scholars and commentators were presented with a number of puzzles. Waka chikenshul kfDROM (pre-1260), for instance, a major commentary of the time, deals with the question of authorship in the following terms. Who wrote the Ise and when? The initial answer is Narihira and his potted biography is given. But matters are not this simple because the Ise contains sections which can clearly be dated after his death in 880: the Imperial Progress to Serikawa (Section 104), for in- stance, which is known to have taken place in 886. There is also the question of differing textual variants. How had they come about?</page><page sequence="30">430 RICHARD BOWRING The answer to this is somewhat convoluted. Narihira started writ- ing while living at Nagaoka in 865 and finished his final draft in 879. Worried that he might be ailing, he revealed it to his wife but decided to pretend when he made it public that he was merely editing something that had been written by somebody else. Lady Ise knew this was not really the case, but before she could tax him with it, Narihira died. Initially distraught at losing him, she gradually found herself becoming involved with court life again and eventual- ly became the favorite of Retired Emperor Uda. The whole matter finally slipped her mind for a while. She then remembered the ex- istence of the work and found the MS in some old boxes. This was the so-called "Imperial Huntsman" text which began with Section 69. On reading it she found that, to her embarrassment, it was full of intimate details about her own love affair with Narihira. To stay true to his memory and yet preserve her own position at court, she rewrote all those parts that referred to her, expunged all signs of her own name, and made it public the next year, 891. It was read with great interest by all, and was understood to have been written by Lady Ise herself. Later, she was going through some old papers when she came across another MS. This version was much more organized than the first and was obviously a final draft that she had overlooked. It began with the present Section 1. Realizing that she had initially used an intermediate draft by mistake, she issued the new version and asked people to destroy the first version.28 Most of this account is, of course, made from whole cloth. As there is in the first place no evidence to link Narihira with Lady Ise, who was probably only about twelve years old when he died, we are being treated to a little fiction that helps to explain away the presence of variants. But to say that Lady Ise could never have been Narihira's wife is one thing; it does not preclude the possibility that she may have had some connection with the work as it emerged. We have already hinted that the Ise might have been edited, or even pro- duced, by the circle that surrounded Retired Emperor Uda, and this inevitably would have involved Lady Ise, who was so occupied with the production of screen-poems. The second "problem" with which medieval commentators con- 28 Katagiri Y6ichi ){iIg -, Ise monogatari no kenkya: shiryohen Yk' (Meiji shoin, 1969), pp.105-7.</page><page sequence="31">ISE MONOGA TARI 431 cerned themselves was the vexed one of the title. No one knew for certain why the work had been entitled Ise monogatari, nor what it re- ally signified. Clearly this only served to add to the general puzzle- ment. What follows is an amalgam of views put forward in Waka chikenshuz and in what Katagiri Yoichi calls the Reizeike 7 tradition of interpretation, which is similar in general tenet but differs in certain particulars. On the subject of the title, four main theories were proposed: 1. That the work had indeed been written by Lady Ise and named after her. This attractive possibility is rejected on the somewhat flim- sy grounds that it was not the custom to name works after their authors. [This is not entirely correct, and it is certainly possible that works were named after their sponsors.] 2. That the title was based on events described in Section 69, where Narihira is said to have seduced the Priestess at Ise. So unprecedented was this second act of violation, violation of both woman and status, that this one outrageous episode had given its name to the whole collection. This is rejected on the grounds that Section 69, although obviously of major interest, can hardly be con- sidered to be the pivotal event of the whole work. 3. That because in the Nihongi the character for I (i) is read "woman" and the character for se (!) is read "man," the work is therefore about sexual union and generation. The explanation given for this theory (and it occurs only in the Reizeike tradition) does not lead at this juncture in the direction of Tantric Buddhism, about which we shall have somewhat more to say later; it deals with the subject by utilizing Shinta myths, and in particular the myth of Izanagi, Izanami, and the founding of Japan. "It tries to explain the ineffable: namely, that from Yin and Yang, Heaven and Earth, arose the gods; and that the Japanese language emerged as the soul of the land. "29 It is difficult to gauge how far we can take cryptic statements like these, but it is more than sheer obscurantism. As we have already argued, the Ise is indeed about the birth of poetic language and its power to unify the sexes. The problem is that such apparent theoretical understanding of how the text works runs com- pletely counter to the spirit of the commentary that follows. 29 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 292.</page><page sequence="32">432 RICHARD BOWRING 4. The fourth argument is in a way more intriguing; curious but instructive. It states that because the basic story was about highly unusual and dangerous goings on, the author (whether or not it were Narihira himself) deliberately distorted events, confused the order of things, mixed up past and present, and reversed city and countryside. It was in this sense a work with carnival aspects. The title therefore came from the phrase "Ise ya Hyiuga" which means something like "topsy-turvy." Waka chikenshuz goes into con- siderable detail about the origins of this phrase, which involves a tale of two men, one from Ise and the other from Hyufga, who died at exactly the same time and whose souls became mixed up. In the end they returned to earth and acted as substitutes for one another. "Although this work contains no falsehoods or lies, it transposes pre- sent and past, past and present; it adds today's words to old poems and old words to today's poems; it writes things in a confused man- ner: it is therefore called Ise monogatari. Indeed, when you read this work, it gives the impression of being obscure and confused, as if one were shooting arrows into darkest night. "30 According to this last theory, then, the Ise is about purposive substitution. The self-serving nature of such an explanation for com- mentators is obvious, for it not only explains the lack of coherent form but demands that the commentator recreate a posited original that has been hidden on purpose to obfuscate unpalatable truths. The text becomes an open space in which the scholar can roam at will, finding keys and revealing secrets behind the facade. To a great extent the detailed commentaries that follow draw their in- spiration from such self-justifying licence. The initial incoherence becomes the commentator's best ally. It is this that allows the author of Waka chikenshuk to proceed from a discussion of the mean- ing of the title to a revelation of the central secret underlying the text. The text is a riddle and it is the commentator who is able to replace the amorphous and chaotic with a different, coherent, and ordered text. When the Emperor came to hear of Narihira's persistently outrageous behavior with the Nijo Consort even after she had entered the Crown Prince's palace, he locked her up and banished 30 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 122.</page><page sequence="33">ISE MONOGATARI 433 Narihira to the northern provinces. Mototsune was the official charged with carrying out the sentence, but being a compassionate man he took pity on Narihira and sent him into hiding. Waka chikenshul has him living with his mother in Nagaoka just south of Heian-kyo;3' the Reizeike tradition, with Section 59 in mind, gives the destination as Yoshifusa's mansion in Higashiyama.32 If our previous analysis of the politics behind Narihira's banishment is at all correct, then the record is now firmly skewed, and the Fujiwaras emerge as the solicitous gentlemen: L't. X C. When he was eventually pardoned, Narihira presented this selection of poem- tales to court as "proof" that he had traveled east and undergone considerable privation; hence the presence of those sections that deal with his travels to the east, the "Azumakudari." To the ini- tiated, however,- the collection is full of clues that he actually remained in or near the capital all the time, and it was for this reason that Narihira called it Ise monogatari, with its suggestion of matters not being quite what they seemed. One corollary of this idea that the travel sections of the Ise were essentially fictional is that they had been created in or around Heian-kyo, and an interesting link to the screen-poem theory of composition can be found in the somewhat unusual Kamakura com- mentary known as Ise monogatari nangichu/ WA, where we find the following remarks: "This tale was created in the Crown Prince's Palace. . . . In the four main buildings were pictures of famous places in Japan. This means that Narihira never left the capital." The commentary goes on to suggest that the work was the product of a small coterie of men who referred to these paintings when necessary, presumably to engender a sense of realism in their descriptions.33 It should be noted here that the assumption that Narihira never actually traveled east is not pure invention but a response to an odd- ity in the text itself: Section 65 describes Narihira visiting the Nijo Consort every night in secret even after his banishment. The "reve- lation" above serves to explain this particular confusion, but in the process it sets up a whole new series of ingenious interpretations 31 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 123. 32 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 305. 33 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 482.</page><page sequence="34">434 RICHARD BOWRING of other passages unrelated to Section 65. There is, for example, an elaborate question and answer session conducted into Section 6 in both Waka chikenshui and the Reizeike texts. The Akutagawa is explained as an obscure name for part of a rivulet that ran through the palace, and the rain, storehouse, and the devil are all shown to be metaphors, in the spirit of the concluding comment in the section itself. Section 7, which reads: "In the past there is a man. Finding life difficult in the capital, he goes east. As he passes along the shore where Ise meets Owari, he sees the white surf and composes: 'In dreadful longing for she from whom I continue to recede, how I envy the returning waves.'," is subjected to the following analysis in the Reizeike tradition: "He goes east. "Azuma ni ikikeru ni. This did not in fact take place. What this really means is that when it emerged that he had stolen the Nij6 Consort, he was kept in the mansion of the Regent Lord Yoshifusa in Higashiyama. Higashi is also read Azuma. "Where Ise meets Owari. " Ise Owari no awai. This is the meeting of the Consort and Narihira, the final meeting (owari no awai) of their tryst. Awai means a meeting of two lovers.... Ise means Yin and Yang. Owari means the last meeting of the two, for he is to be sent into isolation.34 The interpretation of Section 9 shows even more boldness. Sec- tion 9 is the famous "Yatsuhashi" section when Narihira produces his acrostic poem "Kakitsubata," followed by the passing of Fuji and the arrival at the Sumidagawa. "The province of Mikawa." Mikawa no kuni. This means his three loves; three rivers, three waters, hence the heart of three waters. In both the religious and secular classics heart and water are seen to be synonymous. . . . water changes its shape depending on the vessel, the heart differs depending on the object. . . . The three women are the Nij6 Consort, the Somedono Consort, and the Shij6 Consort. "Eight Bridges." Yatsuhashi. This signifies the emotion he has on reluctantly hav- ing to give up these women. The eight included Sanjo no Machi, Aritsune's daughter, Ise, Komachi, and the Priestess at Ise. "Since the waters of the river flowed in all directions. " Mizu yuku kawa no kumode nareba. This refers to the flowing of Narihira's heart, which flows in every direc- tion (kumode). "That swamp." Sono sawa. This is the mansion of his protector at Higashiyama. Why? Because another meaning for the character sawa a is flourishing or munifi- cent. 34 Katagiri, Shiryjhen, p. 305.</page><page sequence="35">ISE MONOGA TARI 435 The iris or kakitsubata is "well known" to be a katami or token, in this case for the Nij6 Consort. [This connotation is proved by reference to a poem in the Gosenshuz and a passage from the Nihongi. ]35 Numerous other identifications are made, both personal and met- aphoric. Later on in this section, for instance, Fuji is equated to the Emperor Seiwa, who went into seclusion in the fifth month of 876 at the age of 37. The unseasonable snow on Fuji's peak in the fifth month is interpreted as an oblique reference to graying hair on a young emperor's head, hence the emperor's own misfortune.36 It will be noted here that a series of women are actually named. Indeed, all such interpretations are governed by what can only be called the rage to identify. Whenever possible each section is not only dated exactly, sometimes to the very day, but the women are all historicized. In this manner, the abstract quality of the text is fur- ther reduced, the anxiety allayed by tying each section firmly into history. One MS of Waka chikenshul even has an appendix which lists Narihira's twelve women in order and then tabulates their occur- rences in the work.37 This strategy can itself have interesting conse- quences. As we have already seen, Ono no Komachi is identified as the woman of Section 25 because the woman's poem is identified in the Kokinshul (623) as being by her. The commentaries seize on this idea that the pair were lovers and then proceed to identify her ar- bitrarily as the woman of numerous other Ise sections. In such man- ner are new and powerful legends launched. NARIHIRA BECOMES A GOD What about Narihira's twelve women? The answer to this takes Katagiri, Shiryohen, pp. 307-8. 36 Could there possibly be a clue here to one of the oddities in the Ise illustrations that we shall have occasion to mention later? Mt. Fuji is often depicted with three peaks. It is possible that this is an allusion to the fact that Fuji was equated in the tradition with the Seiwa emperor (mikado). This would be by no means as far-fetched a reading of mikado as it sounds, in view of the extraordinary twists given to some words in order to give them extra meanings in these commentaries. There are two more possible clues: Kasuga in Section 1 suggests Mt. Mikasa, a reference that is taken up at the end of the N6 play "Unrin'in"; and a short com- mentary entitled "Ise monogatari nanaka hiden L;f$f\" mentions that Narihira is said to have passed by not Fuji but rather Mikamiyama -IEJiLI in the Province of Omi. See Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 500. 37 Katagiri, Shiryohen, pp. 186-89.</page><page sequence="36">436 RICHARD BOWRING us back to that part of the Waka chikenshlz preface that dealt with the question of the title. In answer to the question: why, if Narihira was the author, did he consider the poems and stories so important and why did he collect them, the answer comes as follows: Narihira is the bodhisattva known as Bato Kannon, the bodhisattva of song and dance in paradise.... Seeing the plight of humanity in the world.... he even- tually brought comfort to 3,733 women. He kept records of his activities, writing down what had happened to him in order to proclaim the meaning of the erotic for later generations. The bird inquires: I am greatly puzzled by this explanation. The scriptures say that to approach a female is the ultimate karmic act, thus all Buddhas warn about this in particular, calling it either "fixing the mind on boundless kalpas" or "one cause leading to five hundred births. " What kind of bodhisattva is it who tries to en- courage escape from suffering by urging people to take the path of which others have made such dire-warnings? This is strange indeed. The wind replies: If people are of one accord, the way to become a Buddha is in- deed to practice the austerities of the six perfections, to offer up prayers, to honor and succor one's parents and superiors, and thus to achieve immediate rebirth in paradise; but people are by nature many and various and find it difficult to believe in Buddhist precepts to the exclusion of all else. Since they do not believe, they are fated to wander in the dark for generations. It is for this reason that the Buddhas have divided into a myriad forms and encourage escape from suffering by adapting to human propensities. The bodhisattva in question is not, of course, insisting that we all cast aside the practice of austerities and enter instead upon this particular path; it is rather that, since we now live in degenerate times, in the Latter Days of the Law, humanity has become bored with good intentions and prefers evil ways- so all now enter upon this way to the exclusion of all else. The way is known as the "Principle of Union between the Two Fluids, of Womb and Egg," and there are many who believe that it is an activity that, if one studies well and achieves awareness, will eventually lead to a state of buddhahood in this existence. Because people are constantly warned that this path is neither austerity nor good practice but simply the karmic act of eternal rebirth, many are confused; so it is that this bodhisattva came into this world to show people, to impart to others (if only a little) the true, deep significance of the act. No phenomenon is divorced from the Union of the Two Fluids, of Womb and Egg. If the male becomes heaven by carrying out the austerities of the womb, the female becomes earth by virtue of the diamond-hard body. Heaven and earth-the names differ but in fact it is the union of male and female. Though the earth holds the seeds of grasses and trees, not a single shoot will develop unless heaven bestows the blessing of rain and dew. Though the female holds the place of birth within her womb, there will be no humanity unless the male bestows the seeds of his essence. So the male should prepare to nurture rain and dew in the image of heaven and care for the female; and the female should, in the image of earth-woman, nurture</page><page sequence="37">ISE MONOGA TARI 437 the grass and trees and honor the heaven-male. The male, revolving around the sun, brings warm light; the female, revolving around the moon, contains cold force. There is indeed nothing from water to fire, from the sentient to the non- sentient, that does not involve the two fluids, of womb and egg. So the male should care for the female and not harm her, and the female must honor the male and not harbor wicked thoughts: this is the beginning of the essential way to practice the union of the two fluids. Since it is rare to find anyone who actually believes in the true efficacy of this path of their own accord, one cannot simply state that the way of the womb and the egg is correct practice. This is why Narihira tried to encourage people towards enlightenment by treating this practice as the ultimate austerity.38 In answer to the next question as to why the Ise did not then consist of 3,733 sections, we are told that Narihira chose to write about the twelve women whom he felt had really understood him and who had actually entered upon the Way as a result of his ministrations. The twelve women are then listed by name. It should be clear from the above passage that we are dealing at this point with the vocabulary of left-handed tantric Buddhism and in particular with the heretical Tachikawa izJI! sect. Information about the Tachikawa is sparse for the obvious reason that its scrip- tures were banned, destroyed, and ultimately denied. Most of our knowledge in fact comes from two treatises that were written to counteract its influence: Shinjo's C'L?JuhoyJjinshuz IflC1{ of 1270 and the much later Hokyoshok &amp;Th-4 of 1375 written by Yuikai Vi9 (1345-1416).39 The sect is said to have been founded in the early twelfth century and to have spread rapidly, affecting even Pure Land beliefs. The very strength of the reaction proves its potency. Although its peak of influence was undoubtedly reached with the priest Monkan zZN (1278-1357) and the Emperor Go-Daigo in the early fourteenth century, there is no reason to doubt that its in- fluence is not being directly felt here in Waka chikenshuI. It is more likely that the Ise commentators were taking advantage of the sect's teachings to claim divinity for Narihira, than that the sect was try- ing to appropriate Narihira for its own uses; certainly part of the process whereby Narihira became such a ubiquitous figure in later 38 Katagiri, Shiryohen, pp. 108-10. 39 For further information on the Tachikawa sect see, among others, the relevant chapter in Nakagawa Zenky6 4)lI| , Bukkyogaku ronshuz (Sankib6, 1976), pp. 269-92, and Moriyama Sh6shin qtIVA, Tachikawa jakyo to sono shakaiteki haikei no kenkyu!

Sanford, "The Abominable Tachikawa Skull Ritual," MN 46.1 (1991): 1-20.</page><page sequence="38">438 RICHARD BOWRING folklore and legend was his deification as the god of sexual union, and this was already well advanced by the mid-Kamakura. The mention of Bato Kannon in this context is a nice illustration of how such correspondences were made. Bato Kannon %X, r was Hayagriva, a particularly ferocious manifestation of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, and nowhere in the esoteric tradition is there any mention of a link to music, song, or dance.40 The correspondence was obviously chosen because one of the few official posts Narihira had held had been that of Commander of the Horse Bureau of the Right, Uma no kami tNX; the specious identification with pleasure was presumably just glossed over in the face of such ob- vious proof of his true identity. The general mixture of Taoism and Tantrism that we find here is not exclusive to Waka chikenshul but rather forms a common thread running through most prefaces of this kind. By and large the ar- gument depended on the special meanings given to I and se rep- resenting Yin and Yang. This concept quickly became one of the preferred answers to the problem of what the title meant. What is unusual in this Waka chikenshul preface is the openness of the refer- ence to sexual practice and the explicit linking of sexual activity with enlightenment. It surfaces in a few other commentaries, most notably the Ise monogatari zuino FM9, which begins by using the con- cepts of I and se to express the ultimate non-duality of being, and then goes on to reveal a series of secrets that have to do with the crucial difference between unenlightened intercourse, which merely leads into further suffering, rebirth, and desire, and the enlightened version, whereby women in particular may be initiated into the true tantric mysteries."4 The particular version of Ise monogatari zuind to be found in the Tesshinsai Library 0,06z:M. contains an appendix with a final secret which uses the same kind of vocabulary as the Waka chikenshu passage quoted above.42 Ise monogatari zuino 40 See R.

Note that Katagiri hesitates to accept a date for Tachikawa in- fluence earlier than the fourteenth century and so finds it difficult to ascribe Ise monogatari zuinJ itself to the Kamakura period. This seems unduly restrictive. The dating of these par- ticular commentaries is fraught with difficulties and more research is needed into the spread</page><page sequence="39">ISE MONOGATARI 439 also contains evidence that special ceremonies along the lines of those associated with the initiation into the mysteries of the Kokinshul were considered an essential part of reading the Ise. It urges people to read the tales for enlightenment and to have with them for the occasion a picture of Narihira dressed as he had been on the day of his death.43 In line with the general hagiographic tendencies of the age, Narihira became deified; and one finds signs of this throughout the small notes and commentaries that still survive.44 In addition to being Bato Kannon in Waka chikenshu, Narihira is seen to be the manifestation of Sumiyoshi Daimyojin Ac?4 in Ise monogatari zuinJ5 and the cryptic note entitled "Niji no gi" t claims him as Hitomaro AA reborn.46 POETRY AND RELIGION The deification of Narihira and the treatment of the Ise as a text whose underlying object was to aid enlightenment should be understood as part of a more general move in the Kamakura period towards seeing the production and recitation of waka in religious terms. Indeed the attempt to justify the way of poetry with Buddhist parallels is often seen to be a defining characteristic of the age. The preface to Waka chikenshui is of particular interest in this regard, for it opens with a passage that reads like a somewhat confused compen- dium of all possible strategies: Japanese poetry (yamato uta) is where one begins to search for enlightenment, the source of meditation in solitude, precisely because it takes the heart of man as its seed and can therefore soften the heart of man. Paradise has its Bodhisattva of Song and Dance, India has its magic spells; China has its poetry, divided into six forms; of Tachikawa teachings prior to the fourteenth century before anything can be said with cer- tainty. 4 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 449. 4 The catalogue entitled "Reizeike s6shi mokuroku," thought to refer to the library holdings of Fujiwara Tamesuke (1263-1328), contains over fifty titles connected to the Ise. It is clear, however, that the majority of these are fairly short pieces, notes in the tradition of "secrets" to be imparted to the initiated alone; they are not fully fledged commentaries on the text itself. See Katagiri Y6ichi, Ise monogatari no kenkyui: kenkyuihen (Meiji shoin, 1968), pp. 576ff. 4 Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 453. 46 Katagiri, Kenkyuihen, p. 580.</page><page sequence="40">440 RICHARD BOWRING and in Japan poetry has been a custom ever since the Age of the Gods and remains so today. [ There follows the familiar story from the preface to the Kokinshui of poetry being irregular in the very beginning andfirst being formalized, somewhat ironically, by Susanoo and his poem "Yakumo tatsu. " This particular poem was presumably chosen as thefirst example of regular- ized 5/7/5/7/7 because it is about the delimitation of sacred space, with elements of a mantic spell about it.] At that time the syllables were fixed at thirty-one and the phrases divided into five. Now, in the presence of erroneous thoughts the phrases, the syllables, the form, and the meaning of waka all become the sin of specious and misleading language; whereas in the presence of an enlightened mind they become a taste of the pleasure in hearing Buddhist precepts and of the blessedness of contemplation. Firstly, the reason that poetry is called yamato uta ;kTDi is because both words and meaning have their effect and "greatly pacify 7kT1." Secondly, the fixing of syllables at thirty-one must be by analogy with the thirty-two aspects of the Tath- agata. Among these thirty-two aspects is that known as the Unseen Peak; in other words it cannot be seen by the eye, so only thirty-one aspects are actually visible. A poem always contains a meaning, which does not appear in the syllables but lies hidden. Hence we should think of both poem and Tathagata as having thirty-two aspects. Next, the poem has five phrases: known as jE^XW." These are the five wheels of earth, water, fire, wind, and air. So when you create a well-formed poem, you create a Buddha of the five roots of goodness and the five powers; the five wisdoms, the five instructions, the five aspects, and the five periods all arise from this source. But if you compose a bad poem, then you are faced with a body of this mortal world and it becomes the five aggregates, the five passions, the five misunderstandings, and the five senses. Next, there are the three poetic essentials: 1. Contemplating the topic but failing to express it in words. 2. Expressing the topic in words but failing to contemplate it deeply. 3. Contemplating the topic correctly and expressing it adequately in words. These three correspond to the three manifestations of the Tathagata, that of the True Body, the Body as Reward, and the Body Respondent. To fail to think deeply about either meaning or words is to produce a poem that lacks these three aspects entirely. To contemplate but fail to express is the Void ^, the Tathagata of the True Body. To express well without adequate contemplation is the Provisional i, 47 This somewhat esoteric set of labels for the five phrases of a waka can be found in a number of poetic treatises that date from the late thirteenth century; they include such works as Waka kudenshJ 5Tf n fl {kl, attributed to Tameaki , and the Sangoki EK, a forgery that had a great deal of influence because it was attributed to Teika. The relationship between Waka chikenshui and Sangoki is extremely close and they share nearly all the passages translated here. ji is also found written ,M, and A as A11. Sangoki has A+SIt1Vj1 X and explains them as "on the point of starting, " "beginning, " "topic, " "melody, " and "causing to flow away. " It is unclear where the original inspiration for this particular set of five terms lay, but it was used much later by Shinkei in Sasamegoto (1463-64) in order to explain his theory of linking in renga.</page><page sequence="41">ISE MONOGA TARI 441 the Tathagata of the Body as Reward. To think deeply about both meaning and words is the Middle 4P, the Tathagata of the Body Respondent.... These are the three forms of poetry: Void, Provisional, and Middle. Therefore one should con- sider carefully the topic and express it clearly in words. [This is then followed by an exposition of the six "principles" of Chinese poetic composition which are listed by Tsurayuki in the Kokinshui preface in an attempt to give wakayetfurther legitimacy. They are then arbitrarily assigned to correspond to the six perfections that lead to enlightenment (ropparamitsu) to which are linked the six forms of Japanese poetry, tanka CHR, ch6ka J-S, sed6ka V f, konponka H fl, kaibunka f!S:l, and haikaiuta Tanka divides into two phrases, five and seven, or seven and five; twelve syllables in all for one poem . . . in this type of poetry there is no fixed upper or lower phrase, never mind anything that might correspond to the five great powers. Next we have choka, which fixes the syllables at thirty-one and divides into five phrases.48 As ex- plained above, the five phrases are the five elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and air. The first five syllables are called the "head," the second the "neck," the third the "chest," the fourth the "hips," and the fifth the "tail." The tail comes at the end and in terms of the human body is the feet. The choka should be seen as the basis of real poetry because it contains thirty-one syllables. If all five phrases do not lack heart then you will produce a Buddha of the five powers, and of course if you produce one hundred waka you will create one hundred Buddhas; a thousand waka, one thousand Buddhas. [The passage continues by introducing the concept of poetic "illnesses " that corresponds to the anthropomorphic vision of the waka itself Only correct thinking will of course lead to a healthy poem. It ends with a further set of correspondences: those between the six poeticforms listed above and the six paths (rokud6 A'Ad). Tanka is heaven, ch6ka man, sed6ka asuras, konponka beasts, kaibunka ghosts, and haikaiuta hell. ]49 The concept that the creation of poetry, as rhetorical elaboration, was tantamount to evil in Buddhist terms goes back (at least in Japan) to the famous lines of Bo Juyi: "May the worldly writings of my present life, all the wild words and fancy phrases, serve as a hymn of praise to glorify the teachings of the Buddha in future ages, and cause the Wheel of the Law to turn for ever." These lines are quoted in the Sanbo ekotoba ^ @10q of 948 and appear in Kinto's sZA Wakan rJeishuk fP4h* of 1018 in the "Buddhism" section. They gave rise to the term kyogen kigyo f- %i "wild words and fancy 48 The reason that tanka is here defined as what we now normally call choka goes back to the Kokinshui, where in Book 19 what appear to be in fact choka are labeled as tanka. This mistake caused considerable problems and led to the kind of confused nomenclature being used here.

This concept was to emerge with true vigor in the late twelfth cen- tury, but as early as 1106 we find that the composition of waka is seen as something that may need atonement, particularly for the practicing Buddhist. On 1106.9.13 we come across the priest Senzai 895, later to be known as the Sage of the Ungoji !M A, confess- ing to the sin of kyogen kigyo in a preface to a set of waka. He had made a picture of Sumiyoshi Daimyojin, the Shinto god of waka, depicted as an avatar of the bodhisattva Kokitokuo, and presented offerings and suttras before it in atonement.50 Senzai is known to history as a poet, a friend of Mototoshi -I, Akisue 5,M and Shunrai l and an active utaawase participant, to whom the justification of waka in Buddhist terms was clearly a vital pro- cedure. The same priest is recorded as having made a waka man- dala, depicting the seven Buddhas of the past and the thirty-six famous poets of Japan.5" The link between religion and poetry is revealed in a number of other related activities which emerge in the early years of the twelfth century, the emphasis being on Shinto. Mention of Akisue (1055- 1123), for instance, brings us to the worship of Hitomaro AN, something that Akisue himself instigated in 1118. According to the account to be found in Kokon chomonju,52 the first "Hitomaro eigu" WOR was held in Akisue's private home. It involved hanging up a pic- ture of Hitomaro and presenting offerings, followed by a celebration and composition of poetry. The picture was itself the subject of a story which told how it had been painted by Fujiwara no Kanefusa as the result of a dream. The description of the painting53 tallies remarkably with the traditional portrait of Hitomaro still found 'o This section owes much to a reading of Yamada Sh6zen 11 1B , "Mikky6 to waka bungaku," Mikkyogaku kenkyuz 1 (March 1969).

The ceremony proved to be very popular; an entry in Minamoto Michichika's AN diary for 1202 (inserted after his death earlier that year) talks about such an occasion, and sessions were ap- parently held regularly, attended by the Emperor in disguise. The first extant "Eigu utaawase" is dated 1201. It may well be that this ceremony was invented by Akisue in an attempt to secure his position in the poetic circles of the time, but this in itself does not affect the principle that waka is being tied to religion. The same phenomenon can be found in the world of utaawase as an institution. The late Heian saw a decline in utaawase as court ceremonial but linked to an increased interest in the quality of the poems. In other words, utaawase became less of a game and more of a battle, with all the viciousness and backbiting that this im- plies. Almost as-if in compensation for this sense of divisiveness, one finds clear signs that the religious aspect of the activity is being stressed. There are records of utaawase held at shrines and even the occasional temple55 prior to the twelfth century, but the meet- ings that are usually taken to mark the real beginning of the habit of holding and dedicating compositions at shrines are the three utaawase held by Akinaka 9{+ in the autumn of 1128. Akinaka organized a long outing and held two meetings at the Hirota YL- EI shrine and one at the Sumiyoshi.56 The preface to this last occasion mentions that they visited the shrine because of a dream in which Sumiyoshi My-jin showed resentment at having been left out. From this time on the dedication of utaawase to shrines and gods became commonplace,57 and one has to wait well into the fourteenth century before temples become the object of similar attention. When Saigyo SEj dedicated his twojikaawase nRA? in 1187 it was to the Inner and Outer Shrines at Ise rather than to a Buddhist tem- ple, and similarly when the priest Jien C FR dedicated his jikaawase three years later, he chose the seven deities of the Hie H F Shrine (although it is interesting to note that the preface lists each deity 5 Minegishi Yoshiaki $W 8k, Utaawase no kenkya (Sanseid6, 1954), p. 228. 55 The Mudoji 1iJ and Ungoji , are among the very few temples listed. 56 Hirota on 1128.8.29, Hirota again on 1128.9.21, and Sumiyoshi on 1128.9.28. 57 In the colophon to the "Wakamiya Yashiro utaawase" t:gt of 1191, for instance, we find a note to the effect that the judge, priest Kensh6, remarked that: "utaawase are very com- mon at shrines these days."</page><page sequence="44">444 RICHARD BOWRING together with its honji tPl, presumably in deference to Jien's high position in the Buddhist hierarchy).58 The concept of kyogen kigyo, and the linking of poetry to religious practice which clearly took root in this period, became a matter of central concern in the years following. It can be found mentioned in numerous poetic treatises and also in those tales of poet/priests that grew in such profusion in the mid-Kamakura. Indeed it is intimate- ly bound up with the cult of the recluse, of the eccentric man of religion, which is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the medieval period as a whole. One might have thought that Saigyo, as the figure who stands at the beginning of this tradition as the archetypal poet/priest of the late Heian, would have had something to say on the- subject. But Saigyo, as in most other matters both religious and theoretical, remains silent apart from his poems; perhaps hardly surprising when one thinks that it was only near the very end of his life that he was persuaded even to anthologize his own work. In the larger context of Saigyo's existence as a legendary figure there is the famous passage on poetry in the MyJe Shonin denki fl IAf`i (1235?), but this raises complex problems that cannot be dealt with here. Perhaps the best known passage expressing this concept occurs in the description of an apocryphal meeting between Saigyo and Jien (Jichin M) in Mujui Ichien's ~Eft- F1 Shasekishuz b4? ;H (1279-83), Book 5: After Saigy6 H6shi became a recluse, he received teaching in the inner meaning of the Tendai mantras. The Yoshimizu Abbot Jichin asked him to pass on these secrets. "First, practice waka. He who fails to grasp the heart of waka will fail to comprehend the inner meaning of the mantras," replied Saigy6. And so Jichin first practiced waka before receiving the teachings.... Indeed, the Way of Poetry is an excellent means by which to forget the painful pressures of mundane toil and to enter the marvelous realms of spiritual liberation. Is it not for this reason that those avatars who have left their traces in our land practiced it of old?59 This passage occurs in a particular section of Shasekishu that con- tains a large number of references to kyogen kigyo, a concept which Mujui uses in his overall introduction to the work and which was clearly extremely important to him. Two passages will suffice to give the flavor of this concern: 58 Hagitani Boku and Taniyama Shigeru @SLI1a eds., Utaawase shu, NKBT 74.461 5 Watanabe Tsunaya 90Mlt, ed., Shasekishu, book 5, NKBT 85.251-52.</page><page sequence="45">ISE MONOGATARI 445 Now we count waka as kyogen kigyo because we call it poetry of illusion, because it is drawn by passion, dyed in trivial colors and elaborates with empty words. But it also tells us of religious truths, brings with it a sense of impermanence, weakens our ties to this world, and allows us to forget our attachment to fame and profit; to compose about leaves in the wind is to know the vanity of the world; to compose about the snow and the moon is to awaken to the pure truth within our hearts; and so it can become the means by which we enter the Way of Buddha and understand the Law60. . . . When we think of the Way of Poetry, it soothes the confused and distraught mind and has the virtue of peace and tranquillity; and being of few words it expresses the heart. It has the nature of 'verses that sustain'; in other words it is dharan. i.61 The other major point of interest in the Waka chikenshui preface is the emphasis on the figure five. The fact that waka could be divided into five phrases was grasped at by many poets and critics because of the ubiquitous use of the figure five as a magic number in both Chinese Taoism and Buddhism. It forms a major part of the Waka chikenshuz preface not only in terms of the Five Elements but is further used to link the creation of an image of the Buddha to the anthropomorph- ic metaphor of "head," "neck," "chest," "hips," and "tail" or "feet." This is an old traditional metaphor of Chinese poetic criticism, which extends to describing poetic mistakes and in- felicities as a series of "illnesses" that infect the body poetic. It entered Japanese poetics with the Kakyo hyoshiki SkOA. in the latter half of the eighth century and emerged again from time to time. The convenient extension of this metaphor to include the body of the Buddha himself is, of course, a phenomenon peculiar to the period under review. This correspondence between the five phrases of waka and the Five Elements can also be found in an area closely allied to the Ise tradition: namely the commentaries on the Kokinshui and particu- larly the remarks on the Kokinshui preface. It appears in the well- known Bishamondobon Kokinchu tbi$riv*W+r and in what Katagiri Y6ichi has called the Sanryusho (the Kokin wakashui jo kikigaki: sanryusho T hk FE hi) which has been dated about 1286 and which had perhaps the greatest influence on the interpretation of the Kokinshui. The Sanryuisho not only refers directly to Waka chiken- shui on the record of secret transmission directly from Sumiyoshi 60 Watanabe, Shasekishu, pp. 220-21. 61 Watanabe, Shasekishu, p. 222.</page><page sequence="46">446 RICHARD BOWRING Daimyojin, but it also contains passages such as the following: Question: "Every living creature: which one does not compose poetry." What does this mean? Answer: It does not mean that all living things compose poetry; rather that all liv- ing things are made up of the Five Elements. Their voices are the echo of the Five Elements and the five phrases of a waka are also the Five Elements. This is why the voices of living things are compared to waka. Question: Why do you say that a waka constitutes the Five Elements? Answer: . . . the first phrase is seen to be the wood phrase, because wood governs the east and means the beginning of things. Wood corresponds to humaneness; it means to care for everything. The first phrase of five syllables is at the top of the poem and governs the whole thirty-one; hence it is humaneness. The second phrase is seen as the fire phrase . . .62 WORDS INTO PICTURES There fortunately remains one important piece of visual evidence as to the close relationship between poetry and religious invocation: the set of illustrations to the Ise with Sanskrit dharani. As the illustra- tion shows, the juxtaposition here is startling. It consists of a series of monochrome drawings of scenes from the Ise overstamped with Sanskrit letters. The overstamping is a little crude and seems to have been done in haste, but it is more regular than first sight might suggest. It is fact a repetition of the four-line "Komy6 shingon YE g-&gt;, which reads "Om amogha vairocana maha mudra mani padma jvala pravarttya huiim da" and signifies "Hail to the unfail- ing, the brightly luminous one with its great seal; cause to set forth the jewel, the lotus, and the fire. " ,63 Various reasons have been put forward as to why this eminently secular text should have been overstamped with a dharani in this manner. It may well have been done to try and save its owner or patron from a dangerous illness, or to accumulate merit of some sort. Whether or not there is in fact a closer link between the invocation and the Ise itself is difficult to 62 Katagiri Y6ichi, Chasei Kokinsha chashakusho kaidai (Kyoto: Akao sh6bund6, 1973), 2.226-27. 63 For details see Manabe Shunsh6 A,M , "Hakuby6 shita-e Ise monogatari bonjiky6 no bonji ni tsuite," Yamato bunka 53 (Nov. 1970), p. 27, and C.

It has proved impossible to establish an exact date for this scroll, but studies suggest that, although it is probably a copy of an earlier Heian polychrome illustration of the Ise that has been lost, it is like- ly to date from around the time of Myoe M (d. 1232), who is known to have had special reverence for this particular dharanli.4 It is interesting to note that a picture scroll competition was held under the auspices of Retired Emperor Go-Horikawa in 1233, when bt }w ~ *t '!LQvt.

Morikane was a devoted follower of Myoe and is known to have set great store by chanting the "Komyo shingon". Unfortunately the records of this occasion do not mention an Ise scroll by name.65 This monochrome scroll, obscured as it is with the Sanskrit, is in fact the oldest example we have of Ise illustration and is one of only two such scrolls that survive from the Kamakura. The other is known as the Kubo AS Version, a polychromatic series of paint- ings of a very different style. Sayre argues in his thesis that these two survivals from the Kamakura represent two contrasting and in- deed competing traditions. The dharani version is an amateur pro- duction, perhaps just a draft, which would not have survived if it had not been for the religious significance of the spell; it is a copy of a style presumed to have been current in the mid to late Heian. The Kubo version, being polychromatic, is the product of a professional atelier and shows a tendency towards the proliferation of detail and material unrelated to the text. Although it is clear that both versions cover the most popular sections, both still present complex prob- lems of iconography, making it difficult to match illustrations to text in some cases. The Kubo version indulges in what might possibly be extremely subtle cross-referencing: the underdrawings on each sheet (some of which also contain ashide X+) seem in each case to refer to a section of the Ise other than the one that is actually being il- lustrated. This may be a sign that the painters were illiterate; but Sayre links the sumptuous nature of the Kubo version and this ex- treme subtlety to the reigns of Emperors Fushimi (1288-1301) and Hanazono (1308-18). Both men were members of the weaker senior branch of the Imperial family that was supported by, and in turn supported, the more radical Kyogoku-Reizei school of poets. Sayre links the dharani version to the conservative Nijo school that was predominant throughout most of the period. Although it is true that the iconography as represented by this version did eventually predominate and forms the basis for almost all subsequent illustra- 65 See Karen L.

Illustrations are, of course, another form of reading and they are particularly important when it comes to assessing the role of the Ise in Japanese culture as a whole. Although at this early stage there are certainly many illustrations where it is difficult to identify the precise section of the Ise being drawn, there was general agreement as to what kind of section lent itself to depiction; by far the majority concentrate on three episodes: Narihira's initial affair with the Nijo Consort, the Azumakudari, and the affair with the Priestess at Ise. It will be clear that this choice serves to confirm these as the central events in Narihira's biography. These works show us the birth of the process by which the Ise and Narihira became turned into visual rather than linguistic events. Such a drastic reduction of the text to a series of easily assimilable images was yet another form of reorganizing the text in order to make it more readable. Nowhere is this process made clearer than in the third major example of Ise il- lustration that remains from this period, that known as the "Ihon Ise monogatari emaki. "' The three scrolls that go to make up this emaki would seem to be complete. They present twenty-four sets of text-with-illustration from only eighteen Ise sections. Beginning with the affair of the Priestess at Ise (Section 69), the scrolls recount the biography of Narihira, covering the most well-known parts, the affair with the Nijo Consort and the Azumakudari, with a clear at- tempt to create a flowing narrative." Ise illustrations work by reducing each event-and by event we also mean poem-to one memorable image that acts as an icon. It is as if the attempt to describe the quintessence of a topic in poetry 66 Details from Sayre, 1. 157ff. 67 For further details on the scroll see Sayre, 2.24-62. Sayre has an interesting thesis that ties this particular version to the weaker northern side in the rivalry of the Northern and Southern Courts in the early fourteenth century. The argument does not stand up to scrutiny, however, because it rests on a mistaken interpretation of a set of poems that seem at first sight to be a parodic substitution for present Section 1 17, but which prove on further in- vestigation to be quite a common addition to the section in certain variant texts. It is still just possible that the poems in question have been incorporated into this particular scroll for some ironic purpose, but if so the irony is extremely difficult to recover and the results can only be tentative at best.

For a correct translation of the poems see Vos, 2.158.</page><page sequence="50">450 RICHARD BOWRING (hon'i) that emerges in the period preceding the Shinkokinshui is now being applied to art. The abduction scene, for instance, is reduced to the image of a courtier carrying a lady on his back, usually along a river bank. The banishment is given fullest treatment with the scene at Yatsuhashi reduced to water, irises, and criss-crossed bridges; the passing of Fuji to a few men on horseback gazing at the mountain; Utsuyama to two men leading their horses up a steep defile, with creepers on the rocks and a traveler round the corner; and the scene on the Sumidagawa to a party of men in a boat with the "capital bird" flying overhead. All these images are instantly recognizable. The Ise becomes codified for subsequent culture and expands into every form of decorative art as a set of motifs, the origins of which lie here in the early Kamakura illustrations. The famous Yatsuhashi cinnamon delicacies which are one of the mei- butsu of Kyoto are but the most recent in a long line of references to Ise Section 9.68 SOBER SCHOLARSHIP It is often argued, with some justification, that the use of catego- ries and periods drawn from institutional and political history can be highly misleading when applied to the more general area of cultural history. The anticipation of a major break can hide equally important continuities and blind us to more significant shifts. There is a case, for instance, for seeing the Jokyua no Ran of 1221 as being at least as important as the founding of the Kamakura shogunate in 1196, given that an emperor was physically dispossessed and thrown into ignominous exile. But this study is predicated on the assumption that the concept of a zeitgeist is still valid and that such shifts in how the world is constructed in the mind of a people can in fact be traced through a series of interpretations of an accepted clas- sic. So, whether the banishment of Go-Daigo in 1332 and the sub- sequent rise of Ashikaga Takauji really marks a major watershed or not, the fact remains that in the Ise commentaries produced 68 A note inserted in packets of these Sh6goin Yatsuhashi &amp;R- AY 4I claims that the reference is to a famous koto player called Yatsuhashi, who died in 1685. The delicacies are therefore meant to represent the bridge of a koto. This claim notwithstanding, the motif on the packets and the wrapping is clearly irises and bridges over water.</page><page sequence="51">ISE MONOGATARI 451 during the Muromachi period one can identify certain common characteristics, which mark them as being distinctive. Muromachi scholars, lacking that sense of confidence so essential to the kind of powerful and productive reading that is such a pro- nounced feature of the Kamakura commentaries, greeted the work of their predecessors with something less than enthusiasm. The con- trast is marked. Set against Kamakura exuberance, the sobriety of Muromachi interpretations in fact comes as a little disappointment; but perhaps it is only to be expected from men who were surround- ed by constant strife and who must have seen conservatism as tanta- mount to a sacred duty. It shows us that the tremendous investment of energy that went into the production of the newly emerging art forms such as renga and N6 relied on an equal investment devoted to securing a tradition that was in constant danger of destruction. The following note of caution sounded by Ichijo Kanera -+,*R writing in the preface to Ise monogatari gukensho J of 1474 is typical:69 Among the Ise monogatarz commentaries there is one called Chikenshui OEM, said to be in the hand of Lord Tsunenobu. It is not by him. Also widely read is the Selec- tions in Ten Fascicles.0 Whose handiwork this is we do not know. In the family papers that have been passed down to me, they are treated as "numerous secret teachings" but on examining them myself I have found that not a single one of the Japanese and Chinese sources quoted as an authority is genuine. Not only do these works fail to grasp the essence of the old tales, they cannot be relied upon for their comments on either style or vocabulary. The untutored should place not one iota of faith in them, for they are bound to lead into mistaken paths. The Chikenshii, for instance, claims that Narihira was the manifestation of Bat6 Kannon and that Ono no Komachi was the manifestation of Nyoirin Kannon. And that is not the last of its idiocies. I can only assume that it is a later forgery by someone obsessed by things sexual who borrowed the name Tsunenobu to make him seem to be an ally of the cause. If Tsunenobu really had written it, then Lord Teika must have come across it; but nowhere do we find reference to it, not even when Teika discusses the matter of the title. It is all most suspicious. On no account should these Selections be used as a model. On this matter of the title, there is a theory that Lady Ise was the author. There is also another theory that Narihira himself was describing his own exploits in the 69 Ichij6 Kanera had finished a first draft of Gukenshj in 1460 but produced a revised ver- sion (1474) in Nara, whence he had fled to escape the fighting in the capital during the Onin war. 70 Jikkan no shou teQ'C J/. This is presumed to be the same as Katagiri's "Reizeike" t7% * tradition. See p. 431.</page><page sequence="52">452 RICHARD BOWRING guise of the past. Neither theory has yet been proved correct. One reason why some say that Lady Ise wrote it is that the Procession of the Ninnaji Emperor to Serikawa occurred after Narihira's death. The theory that Narihira himself was the author is based on the idea that the section where Narihira goes down to Ise as the Imperial Huntsman and sleeps with the Priestess is in fact the central episode of the whole work, hence giving rise to the title. This theory states that there is a version that ac- tually begins with this episode. Lord Teika mentions this in his colophon but claims that the idea was Koreyuki's and so cannot be relied upon. Needless to say, some names of the women to whom Narihira made love are men- tioned in the story, and their names can also be found attached to their respective poems in various imperial anthologies. But it is extremely odd how older commen- taries attach a name to each and every section. Even supposing all these women were alive at that time, it is most unlikely that such secret goings-on would be com- mon knowledge; and still less probable that one could make an informed guess about something that happened so long ago. There may be a secret tradition, but I doubt whether it is-very trustworthy. According to one tradition Narihira never went east. The references to famous places in the east are said to refer to Higashiyama or somewhere else near the capital. This is utter nonsense. The fact that he traveled east is clearly mentioned in the Kokinshu, the Gosenshu, and the Yamato monogatari: one could hardly ask for better proof. According to another theory, when it mentions places far off in the north of the country Narihira did not actually get that far but in fact wrote such poems to make it seem as though he had been there: a habit of writers of fiction, they say. Such a theory may have some merit. (Yet another theory has it that Narihira, as a result of having slept with the Nij6 Consort, became a priest. Then, in order that his hair might grow again, he went off to Yasoshima in the Province of Mutsu and there heard the voice of Ono no Komachi, whose skeleton was blowing in the autumn wind, calling 'aname, aname.' This is mentioned in Book 14 of GJke shidai jit*. Any theory of Masafusa's ETD should, of course, be taken seriously.)7' Here in the preface, and later in the notes to the text itself, the im- pression is of a man taking the utmost care. The comments on Sec- tion 9, "Kakitsubata," for instance, are quite straightforward and near the end he remarks: "If there are any oddities in the text, the wise man will leave them as they are."72 One must guard against fanciful interpretations because they are a sign of irresponsibility. There is the archivist's concern with historical detail balanced with the knowledge that some of the sections must be fictions and hence accepted as such. About the title, he has almost nothing of interest to say. While realizing that Narihira could hardly have been the 71 Katagiri, Shiryohen, pp. 505-6. 72 Katagiri, Shiry5hen, p. 517.</page><page sequence="53">ISE MONOGATARI 453 author of the whole work, he accepts the attribution of "mukashi otoko" as Narihira, not least because many of the poems are so as- signed in the Kokinshu, and that particular anthology is seen to be beyond question. On the matter of identifying the various women, he is cautious: when in doubt the response is invariably "this woman is no one in particular. " It is in all a highly conservative per- formance. Perhaps it is just what we should expect from a scholar who was fighting to preserve what elements of traditional culture he could in the face of constant warfare, but the open dislike of the abandon that characterized the Kamakura commentaries is of in- terest when we consider that we are also talking about the grandson of Nij6 Yoshimoto Kanera was a renga poet in his own right and author of the compendium Renju gappekishui (1476?). Renga was a game with rules that drew their authority from the waka tradition. In the sense that it made use of traditional classifica- tions and associations, it represented a vigorous reaffirmation of the classical heritage and depended on a knowledge of precedent for its very existence. Its codes and formulae presupposed secure founda- tions, hence the concern of all renga masters to transmit the "cor- rect" versions of the Imperial anthologies, the Genji monogatari and the Ise. One could not afford to play fast and loose with unusual in- terpretations when one's own library had just been burned down in a civil war. This is, surely, what lies behind the rather angry and impatient tone of Kanera's preface. And whereas the main thrust of Kamakura commentaries had been on the prose, the "story," and the historical context, Kanera shifts the emphasis back to the poetry: the poems themselves become the focus of attention, rather than the circumstances of their production. Not that the shift is radical, but the Ise is definitely being read and commented upon for a new and different purpose. Kanera's intention is to discuss the essence of each poem, to deal with matters of engo and hidden mean- ings, and to explicate so as to facilitate a reading of the text. After all, it was not in the interests of these men to shift attention away from language and onto context, because it was precisely this language that they needed to ratify as their past and their founda- tion. One also catches a tone of impatience with the business of secret traditions and other such obscurantism. There are no im- precations on those who might divulge these writings to the wider</page><page sequence="54">454 RICHARD BOWRING world, and nothing resembling the secrets of the Kokinshui. One is merely trying to keep the classics alive. This kind of sobriety was, in general, followed by scholars throughout the period, so much so that Hosokawa Yu-sai's W?fiJ Ise monogatari ketsugishol MR41P? of 1596 differs little in intent and view- point from what had been done almost one hundred and fifty years earlier. Among the more interesting commentaries written in the in- tervening period are those that record the lectures given by the renga poet S6gi vTJ;: namely, Sh6haku's ti;b Ise monogatari shomon- shoJ ArWv, which exists in various versions apparently compiled over the years from 1477-1491, and S6ch6's 5A Ise monogatari Sogichg, 7 -S, the date of which remains unclear. Sogi comes down on the side of Lady Ise as the probable author but the pattern of his comments largely follows Kanera, especially in the reluctance to name any but the most obvious of the women. Like Kanera, more time is spent on paraphrasing and explaining the poems than anything else. The only real difference in approach is that Sagi was more prepared to recognize in the text some elements of haikai, a concept that is best translated in this context as "'down-to- earthness." Section 23, known as "Jzutsu," is a case in point. Previous commentators, including Kanera, had been disturbed by the lack of elegance (yiugen) in the scene in the second part of this long episode, where the woman is suddenly discovered piling rice in a bowl. Kanera had taken this gesture as a metaphor for some other homely and hence unerotic action, which duly shocks the man into his senses. Sogi, however, accepted the scene at face value and termed it an example of haikai.74 73 Perhaps better known by the title suggested by Katagiri Y6ichi: Ise monogatari Socho kikigaki ri l 1%. 74 For further discussion see Yamamoto Tokur6 [LWRtM, "Ise monogatari no haikai: S6gi no chuki o megutte," in Ronshui: Nihon bungaku, nihongo 2: chuiko (Kadokawa shoten, 1975), pp. 146-59. It is interesting to note in this context that the word "keko" in the phrase "tezukara iigai torite keko no utsuwamono ni morikeru o mite" was glossed *T and so understood by Kanera, S6gi, and indeed all commentators as meaning "servants." The phrase then read "he saw her take a ladle and pile the rice in bowls for the servants." It was only with the ad- vent of Keicha's '1 Seigo okudan Il2l. that the word "keko" was redefined as meaning "container, " so giving rise to the modern interpretation that she was piling the rice in her own bowl: an interpretation that had been explicitly rejected in the Reizeike tradition. See Katagiri, Shiry5hen, p. 608.</page><page sequence="55">ISE MONOGATARI 455 NARIHIRA ON STAGE Mention of "Jzutsu" brings us naturally to No, where reference to the Ise has an important role in a number of plays. Since the links between the use of language in renga and that in No are obviously close, and since we know that Zeami (1363-1443) excelled at renga and was highly regarded by Nijo Yoshimoto (1320-88), we might expect a similar approach to classical reference; first impressions, however, are of great contrast. The difference is largely attributable to the difference in art form. Renga, tightly regulated and leaning heavily on the tradition to give it strength and stature, was mainly concerned with isolated words and phrases and their connotations. No, on the other hand, needed to identify key moments in the tradition that could then be isolated and plumbed to the depths; it was therefore interested in the mythic dimensions of its source material and so ransacked the tradition for themes and symbols, having scant respect for the textual integrity of its sources. In those No plays that use the Ise, this sense of freedom remains constant; but what does appear to change is the degree to which earlier interpretations intervene between text and play. Re- search has shown that those No plays that use the Genji as a source betray strong influence from the commentaries and handbooks current during the fourteenth century, and a number of oddities in the No can be explained with reference to these intermediaries.75 In like manner, the majority of Ise references turn out to be gov- erned by prior interpretations, and in some cases it is the commen- tary itself that actually gives rise to the play. "Kakitsubata" shows this most plainly. As the title suggests, the play is based on Section 9 of the Ise, the "Yatsuhashi" episode. A traveling priest, as waki, arrives in Yatsuhashi in Mikawa and sees irises in full bloom in the marshes. While aware that they are supposed to be nonsentient, he praises their beauty. The shite then emerges and answers his questions by quoting from Section 9, in- cluding the famous poem "Karagoromo." The details of the con- versation that follows are closely based on the Reizeike tradition of 75 See Janet Emily Goff, "The Tale of Genji as a Source of the No: Yugao and Hajitomi, " HJAS 42.1 (1982):177-229, and her Noh Drama and The Tale of Genji: TheArt ofAllusion in Fif- teen Classical Plays (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991).</page><page sequence="56">456 RICHARD BOWRING interpreting this section.76 In particular the Nijo Consort is identified as one of Narihira's "eight women" and the iris is defined as an icon or "katami no hana." In two aspects, however, the commen- tary is not followed: given that the scene takes place at Yatsuhashi, the "Azumakudari" is clearly treated as if it did in fact take place, whereas the Reizeike tradition denies it; and the iris in the play is seen, at least in the beginning, to be an icon for Narihira rather than for one of the women. This kind of shift is only to be expected in No, especially here, where the play hinges on the ultimate indivis- ibility of male and female. In the second part of "Kakitsubata" the shite appears wearing both Narihira's coming-of-age crown and the Chinese robe that belonged to the Nijo Consort. The shite, revealing itself as the spirit of the iris, becomes both Narihira and the woman, a katami for both figures. In this combined role of male and female, a symbol of sex- ual union, s/he reveals that Narihira is the Bodhisattva of Song and Dance, his poetry is the Japanese equivalent of holy writ, and he has now even brought enlightenment to nonsentient plants, namely the iris: we have here of course a variation of the theme of the innate potential of the natural world to achieve buddhahood tz*1?XS {A. Dancing, the spirit then turns into Narihira and finally disap- pears. During this process we get further commentary on Narihira and the Ise. The reason that he was traveling to Kasuga in Section 1 and the significance of the word "uik6buri" in the same section is explained with vocabulary drawn from the Reizeike tradition, while Narihira's role as bodhisattva is explicitly linked to his role as the god of the union of opposites, of Yin and Yang: MMODP. Woven into the text are references to sections 8, 7, and 64 of the Ise, all of which can only be linked together by the fact that the woman in each of them is identified as the Nijo Consort in the Kamakura com- mentaries. The choice is therefore not random but guided by an ex- act knowledge of the tradition. There is even one quotation in the text that has been traced to the commentary Ise monogatari zuino gI4 . 77 The second example is "Unrin'in, " which is of interest to 7 See p. 434. 77 See It6 Masayoshi fSIEA, "Ise monogatari to y6kyoku," in Ise monogatari, Yamato monogatari, ed.

It happens to exist in a manuscript which is at- tributed to Zeami himself, but this does not necessarily imply that he originally wrote or conceived of the play. Indeed, as we shall see, it is more likely that it was already part of the repertoire before he emerged as a major playwright. From the outset it is clear that "Unrin'in" shares the prediliction for Kamakura commentaries. A man called Kinmitsu from the village of Ashiya in the Province of Tsu is so devoted to the Ise monogatari that one night he dreams about it and sees in this dream a vision of Narihira and the Nij6 Consort standing together in the grounds of the Unrin'in. He decides to go to the capital and see for himself. At the temple he falls asleep again and an old man comes to him to explain some of the "secrets" (shinajina) of the Ise. The line "somosomo kono monogatari wa ikanaru hito no nanigoto" is quoted straight out of the preface to Waka chikenshu.80 This is then followed by two other passages from the same preface. Kinmitsu is then told why the poem in Section 12 of the Ise uses "Murasakino" rather than the "Kasugano" that one might expect from a read- ing of the Kokinshu. The answer, following the Reizeike tradition, explains that "Musashino" actually refers to a Musashizuka in Kasuga. As was the case with "Kakitsubata," the consequences of this kind of explanation (namely that the "Azumakudari" never ac- tually occurred) are ignored, so it is clear that the use made of the Kamakura commentaries was somewhat selective. As if to drive home the point that they were being used, however, there is the 78 The earlier version is available in Yokomichi Mario ;-fi- Aft and Omote Akira *W eds., Yokyokushuz I, NKBT 40.147-158; the later version can be found in Koyama Hiroshi 'JJ O, J et al. eds., YoYkyokushzu I, NKBZ 33.441-50. Both versions can be found in Karen Brazell, ed., Twelve Plays of the Noh and Kyogen Theaters, Cornell University East Asia Papers No. 50 (Ithaca: Cornell University East Asia Program, rev. ed., 1990). 79 See further comments on this matter in Thomas Blenman Hare, Zeami's Style: the Noh Plays of Zeami Motokiyo (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986), pp. 57ff. 80 See Katagiri, Shiryohen, p. 105.</page><page sequence="58">458 RICHARD BOWRING presence at this juncture of the tell-tale phrase "ge ni ge ni Ise ya Hyuiga no koto" ("it's all rather topsy-turvy"). At this point in the play the spirit changes to become the embodi- ment of the Nij6 Consort's brother, Mototsune, and the latter half is a complex weave of references to Ise sections 6, 12, 65, and 9, the story of the abduction and "saving" of the Nijo Consort. It is all told, of course, from the point of view of the brother. The use of Mototsune as a spirit is particularly apt because it grows naturally from Section 6, where he is identified as being the demon that ate the woman up in one gulp. The important thing for our immediate interests here, however, is to note that sections 6, 12, 65, and 9 can be linked only because of the Reizeike tradition, which identifies the "woman" in all these sections as being the Nij6 Consort. The ra- tionale for the-link, yet again, lies in the Kamakura commentaries, not in the text itself. The play "Oshio" deals with Narihira and the Nij6 Consort at Oharano in somewhat similar terms to the above, although there are no specific quotations used that have been traced to the commen- taries. There is, however, a fragment of a piece known as "Sumi- yoshi sengu no no, " part of which is recorded by Zeami as "Kuzu no hakama" in his essay Go on.8' From what remains of this work, it would appear that the text, which Zeami records as having been written by his father Kannami, is based very closely on that part of the Waka chikenshui preface that describes how the author met an old man from Sumiyoshi dressed in "clothes of vine" and requested from him the secrets of the Ise. None of the above plays can be ascribed to Zeami. "Kaki- tsubata" is traditionally said to be his but there is no solid evidence to support this claim.82 "Unrin'in" would appear originally to have been someone else's work that Zeami may have altered, and "Sumi- yoshi sengu" could well have been written as early as 1374, when the shrine in question was in fact moved. "Oshio" is most likely by Zenchiku. The only other Ise play of significance, "Izutsu," however, is definitely by Zeami and can be dated with reasonable certainty as having been written between 1423-30. It is of particular 81 The text can be found in Omote Akira and Kat6 Shuichi, eds., Zeami, Zenchiku, Nihon shiso taikei 24.213-14. 82 See Hare, p. 134.</page><page sequence="59">ISE MONOGATARI 459 interest because its attitude to the source text is somewhat different. "Izutsu" involves constant reference to Section 23 of the Ise. It opens with a traveling priest who visits the Ariwaradera, which used to be where Narihira and the daughter of Ki no Aritsune lived when they were man and wife. The daughter's spirit emerges, tells the story of Section 23, and then reveals who she is, expressing her feelings of longing and her desire for deliverance from such hope- less yearning. She appears again later wearing a cloak that had belonged to Narihira and so takes on the aspect of her lover. There follows the famous scene when she looks into the well, remembers how as children they used to gaze at their own reflections, and be- comes in that instant the embodiment of male and female. The play ends with a dance in remembrance of him. The style, as Hare has pointed out,83 is replete with renga-like techniques of word associa- tion, and in general its use of the Ise can be illustrated simply by direct reference to the text itself. There is however some evidence that the Kamakura commentaries are still making their presence felt. First, there is the matter of the identity of the "woman" in Sec- tion 23 as the daughter of Ki no Aritsune. This is not to be found in the text but rather in the Reizeike tradition, and it also helps to explain why the last major sequence incorporates quotations from poems in Ise Sections 17 and 24: the Reizeike commentaries as- sociate both of these sections as well with the woman in question.84 Secondly, there is the way in which the shite becomes both male and female, so harking back to the idea that Narihira had been and still was the god of sexual union. Both of these elements are strongly reminiscent of what we have been describing above; and yet, com- pared to the other "Ise" plays, "Jzutsu" does appear to be some- what less reliant on the commentaries, and there is certainly no sign of any direct quotations from Waka chikenshui. It is possible that this difference in approach is fundamental and reflects in turn on the whole thorny question of authorship. The 83 "Izutsu" is analyzed at considerable length in Hare, pp. 134-60. 84 This is an aspect of "Izutsu" that Hare misses: p. 155. There is in fact a divergence of opinion between the two major Kamakura commentaries at this point. The Reizeike tradi- tion identifies the woman as Ki no Aritsune's daughter, but Waka chikenshuz not only fails to mention this but even denies that the man is Narihira, on the grounds that the repetitions in the poem "Tsutsu izutsu" prove it to be a very old one that has been used at this point because it fits the subject matter of the prose tale.</page><page sequence="60">460 RICHARD BOWRING argument would go something like this. Although we do not have an Ise commentary by Nijo Yoshimoto, we do know that Ichij6 Kanera, writing only some thirty years after "Izutsu," was highly critical of the Kamakura commentaries in a way that reflects well the particular concerns of the renga poets. We know that Nijo Yoshimoto was a renga poet and critic who thought very highly of Zeami's abilities in renga. It is therefore reasonable to assume that Zeami would have absorbed similar views about how the tradition should be used. Even given the fact that N6 used sources in a fun- damentally different way from renga, it is also reasonable to assume that Zeami would not have felt happy using the Ise in quite the way that either "Kakitsubata" or "Unrin'in" uses it. The one play that is definitely attributable to him, "Izutsu," has not fully broken away from those commentaries but does appear to be less dependent upon them and accords more with the renga use of the tradition. "Kakitsubata" and "Unrin'in" certainly reflect the influence of Kamakura rather than Muromachi readings of the Ise. Whether they are pre- or post- Zeami is more difficult to say. It6 Masayoshi is firmly of the opinion that they are later works and that "Kaki- tsubata" shows enough similarity to "Oshio" as to be almost cer- tainly by Zenchiku. We do know from a passage in Zenchiku's Meishukushuz J that he took the theory of Narihira's divinity seri- ously.85 What is certain is that further research into exactly how these plays treat their source material might well help to clarify the authorship in a number of cases. THE STORIES MULTIPLY When we turn to the use that was made of the Ise by those many anonymous creators of Muromachi fiction, we find that yet again the kind of conservative commentary produced by Kanera does not have the power that one might expect. Perhaps, as with the situa- tion in No plays, one can explain this by simply referring to the nature of the art form: the kind of fictions produced in the Muromachi naturally gravitated towards Narihira as hero and his 85 See It6 Masayoshi, YJkyokushui 1.417, Shincho Nihon koten shuisei (Shinch6sha, 1983) and Nishino Haruo in Nono sakusha to sakuhin, Iwanami koza: No kyogen, ed. Yokomichi Mario et al. (Iwanami shoten, 1987), 3.214-16.</page><page sequence="61">ISE MONOGATARI 461 more extraordinary exploits, and away from that concern with the poems themselves that had been the prime concern of Kanera and others like him. Certainly, as we proceed through the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries the tendency to divorce Narihira from the Ise qua text, the tendency for Narihira to "take off" as an independent cultural figure, becomes stronger and stronger. The prose tradition that developed through this period known to us as the Muromachi happens to be the most neglected and ill-understood period of Japanese fiction. It is still difficult to gain anything more than a rough outline of what was being written at this time. The nature of these works, the identity of their authors, the way they were linked to the performing arts and to illustration, and the questions that surround the social base of their production and consumption are all yet to be fully studied. The best that can be done is to identify some major characteristics. Firstly, the element of performance is paramount, so much so that it is often difficult to know where to the draw the line between prose fiction and libretto.86 The general consensus of opinion seems to be that the majority of these stories were supposed to be read out aloud, perhaps to accompany an illustrated scroll. Certainly the nar- rators are often obtrusive, and many other elements in the style, in- cluding a liberal use of shichigocho rhythms, point to oral production. Secondly, although the range is exceptionally broad, the didactic element carried on from the Kamakura tale collections remains strong. This element can be manifest in a number of ways: one extols either belief in a particular bodhisattva, or a particular suitra, or the efficacy of praying at a particular shrine. Certainly the major- ity carry a clear message. Occasionally, as in the case of "Bunsho s6shi, " the theme is that of worldly success (so prefiguring the work of Saikaku perhaps) but by and large we are in a world of failure where the message is that of the vanity of all human desires and the importance of religious retirement. It is here that these stories link to the tradition of engi or tales about the origins and foundations of shrines and temples that is another marked feature of this age. 86 See, for example, James T. Araki's comments about the possibility of including kowakamai texts, known as kowaka bukyoku, and even kojoruri texts under the general rubric of otogi-zoshi: "Otogi-z6shi and Nara-ehon: a field of study in flux," MN 36.1 (1981): 1.</page><page sequence="62">462 RICHARD BOWRING Didacticism becomes the central organizing principle around which such tales are constructed. Thirdly, there is the related phenomenon of the telling of tales in order to pacify the souls of the departed. This had particular significance for a nation indulging in almost constant warfare. From the Heike monogatari (and it is as well to remind ourselves that the Kakuichibon version of the Heike that we now read is more a product of the earlyfourteenth century than any other) to the Soga monogatari, there is a tradition of relating the deeds of warriors so that their souls might be spared further torment. Much like the act of confession, where the verbalization of a burden or secret is in itself the act of expiation, the idea was that narration in and of itself was meritorious for narrator, audience, and, above all, hero. Those involved in such activities were itinerant miko and the priests of the Ji 4 sect.' But how does Narihira figure in these works of Muromachi fiction? The unusual aspects of the Kamakura commentaries were uppermost, except that the explicitly tantric elements were apparent- ly too extreme to be accepted in such a world.88 The figure of 3,733 women, for instance, appears in a number of stories such as "Kamiyo Komachi," "Aro monogatari," "Kacho Fuigetsu," "Koshibu," and "Himeruri." The "Azumakudari" is described as not having taken place in "Chojui gika-awase monogatari," where there is the explicit comment "see the commentaries," and both "Akamatsu Goro monogatari" and "Narihira yume mono- gatari" have clear affinities to the No play "Unrin'in" in that they involve someone seeing Narihira and the Nijo Consort in a dream. In "Aro monogatari" we also come across the following passage: That Middle Captain was the Bodhisattva of Song and Dance in Paradise, the very manifestation of Kannon. Inwardly he maintained his vows in secret; outwardly he seemed to assuage his lust at random. And yet, of the 3,733 women he slept with, not one did he violate against her will. "Shirurame ya ware ni au mi no yo no hito no kuraki ni yukanu tayori ari to wa" 87 See D. E. Mills, "Soga Monogatari, Shintoshiu and the Taketori Legend, " MN 30.1(1975): 37-68. 88 Most of the information that follows comes from Ishikawa Toru )IIIA, "Muromachi jidai monogatari ni okeru Ise monogatari no ky6ju, " in Ise monogatari chzi, Muromachi bungaku san- shul 1, ed.

There was a limit to his manifestation and so at the hour of the dog on the 28th day of the fifth month of Gankei 4, at the age of 56, he met his end facing north.89 It is of interest that this poem does not occur in the Ise. In fact the only other place it can be found is in the secret teachings entitled "Gyokuden shinpi no maki TfjAVA," while a poem with some- what similar phrasing can be found in Ise monogatari zuino.90 This in itself is surely proof that the authors of these stories were highly erudite men and women. Perhaps the clearest case of a late Kamakura commentary being used as a source,-however, is in the story "Getsurins6 YiWJV." This is an example of what Ichiko Teiji classified as a "non-human type," namely a story that deals with plants or animals.91 "Getsu- rins6" involves a battle between a proud bamboo and a popular plum tree in the grounds of the Chikurinji near the capital. The plum tree loses the fight and its fruit is pickled. To bring consolation to the plum, a series of plants and vegetables emerge and each gives an account of its origin, these accounts taking up some eighty per- cent of the tale.92 The vegetable dish that brings with it reference to the Ise is the "ko no mame" or "beans with miso, " and the link is a word-play on the "mame" meaning bean and the "mame" of "mameotoko," the man of sincerity, a phrase used to identify the man in the Ise. The discussion is of a series of "facts" about the Ise and Narihira, all of which seem to have been lifted without change from Ise monogatari nangichuz Ai. 93 The borrowing of passages from 89 Ishikawa, p. 189; and Ichiko Teiji et al., eds., Muromachi monogatarishui-jo, Shin Nihon koten bungaku taikei, 54.91-92.

" Nangichuz is not in essence a commentary at all; rather a collection of secret traditions about cer- tain figures and words. It is also full of folk etymologies, alternative versions of poems, and in a number of cases includes further anec- dotes about Narihira that are not found elsewhere. It clearly an- swered a need, being used, among other things, as the source for a fairly lengthy passage in the k6wakamai "Shizuka." The last set of examples can be seen as an extension of the above: namely those stories where it is clear that Narihira has become detached from the Ise altogether. They include Soga monogatari and "Aoba no fue. " In Book 5 of the rufubon Soga monogatari, after a passage that describes Yoritomo hunting foxes and being intrigued by the fact that-they are barking in summer rather than autumn, there is quite a long section that describes "an old story" about Narihira and a fox woman. The Ise contains no such reference, but four of the five poems that appear are taken (out of order) from Ise Section 21. The last poem, "Wakare o ba," cannot be found in the Ise at all.94 The section ends with the remark: "It is said that this was a secret episode in the Ise monogatari. " This is correct, and the source of the secret episode was the same Ise monogatari nangichui to which we have just referred. A section entitled "Tamatsushima no onzukai no koto" has been reproduced almost word for word, even down to the rogue poem "Wakare o ba. In "Aoba no fue" the Emperor Ninmyo asks Narihira to find a beautiful flute. He meets a child at the Rash6mon gate, follows him to an old temple at Minase and eventually has time for discussion. The child extols the virtues of the Lotus Sutra and next day takes Narihira to Minoo, where he bestows upon him a marvelous flute. Narihira takes it back to the emperor and is given all honors. Although Narihira is said in Section 65 of the Ise to be adept at the flute, there is no mention of his being connected to this particular story or this particular flute either in the Ise or in any of the extant commentaries. A similar tale involving Narihira does appear in Sec- 9' See Thomas J. Cogan, trans., The Tale of the Soga Brothers (Tokyo: Tokyo University Press, 1987), pp. 119-22. 95 See Katagiri, Shiry6hen, pp. 481-82. It is also worth noting that this tale must be the source for the Muromachi story "Kohatagitsune."</page><page sequence="65">ISE MONOGATARI 465 tion 18 of volume 4 of the Shintoshu entitled "Suo daimyojin satsuki no e no koto. " The flute Aoba appears in both Godanshi and Jikkin- sho but the first time that Narihira is linked to it would seem to be in the late Kamakura tale collection Zoku Kydkunsho.96 Nangichu, for once, does not seem to have been involved in this case, although it clearly played an important role during the Muromachi. It ap- pealed because it represented in a sense a reemergence of some- thing that was present at the very birth of the Ise itself: a drive towards accretion of new material. It was neither sober commentary 'a la Kanera, nor even exuberant commentary 'a la Chikenshuz. It was yet another response to that sense of initial anxiety that we have isolated as stemming from the Ise: not identification within history or appropriation for other ideological ends, but simply more of the same, infinitely-expandable process. Two of the stories that contain Narihira in one form or another also deal with fan paintings: "Jippon 6gi" and "Kacho Fuigetsu. "97 The actual content of these stories is not of major interest here, for they are both treated as vehicles whereby knowledge about Narihira and the Ise might be disseminated, but the fact that fan paintings are used as the excuse for su'ch didacticism does remind us that the tradition of illustrating the Ise and of using paintings that referred to well-known Ise sections continued on throughout the Muromachi. That the study of the Ise was of central concern can be seen from the fact that Sanj6nishi Sanetaka's diary, the Sanetaka koki, contains over eighty references to the work in one form or other over the years 1477-1532. A number of these entries refer to illustrations, not only for scrolls and fans, but also cartouches (shikishi). Sayre has described in detail how one can trace all these illustra- tions back to a source in the early Kamakura.98 Although such work consciously harks back to the best of the Heian, it is probably the work of amateur court enthusiasts rather than professional painters: the execution is uneven and the general level of technique and material low. Sayre also traces a general path whereby more and more extraneous material is left out and each scene is increasingly 96 Information from Ishikawa, p. 206. 97 To be found in Yokoyama and Matsumoto, eds., Muromachijidai monogatari taisei, vols. 7 and 3 respectively. 98 See Sayre, 1: 184ff.

This shift is clearly visible from the "Onobon emaki" and the "Hokuni bunko emaki," although the "Ise monogatari ehon" in the Spenser Collection in the New York Public Library is a spectacular exception. Here the artist has been given full range to cover all 125 sections, which is itself unprecedented. The result is in fact more an illustration of life in the Momoyama capital at the time than a series of Ise illustrations. In general, however, it is still fair to see a progression towards economy, a movement which culminated in the illustrations to the Sagabon version of the Ise, first published in 1608. Here the main sections (forty-eight of them) are finally crystallized into icons that would live in the Japanese mind throughout the ensuing Tokugawa period, not only on paper but on kimono fabric, brush containers, playing cards, and other accoutrements of everyday life. COMMENTARY AS WEAPON Mention of the rise of cultural nationalism that marks the eigh- teenth century and goes by the name of kokugaku immediately brings to mind the marked anti-Chinese rhetoric of Motoori Norinaga and Hirata Atsutane; but the origins of such an ideology lie in a more scholarly passion for philological research. The movement, if move- ment it can be called, grew out of the efforts of a number of lin- guistic archaeologists, who took full advantage of the prolonged peace to dig into the past and repossess a series of early texts that had become to all intents and purposes unreadable. It was their suc- cess in deciphering works such as the Man'yoshuz and Kojiki that revealed the tantalizing possibility of recreating an authentic past that predated Chinese influence. It would be a mistake, however, to impose this later ideological intent on the earlier scholars. The late seventeenth century was a period when every major Japa- nese classic was subjected to careful scrutiny and reappraisal, and when prior scholarship was subjected to reevaluation on an un- precedented scale. Heian classics such as the Ise and the Genji were no exception. Keichui's (1640-1701) main claim to fame is the philological ex- pertise that he brought to the study of the Man'yoshu, embodied in the Man'o)shu daishoki, which had been begun by Shimokobe</page><page sequence="67">ISE MONOGATARI 467 Choryui in 1673 and which Keichui took over ten years later in 1683 at the behest of Tokugawa Mitsukuni. There can be no doubt that his philological rigor was of a higher standard than any of his predecessors and that his commentary marks the real beginning of comprehension of the Man 'yoshu- as a whole. Part of the reason that Keichui managed to do so much more must lie in the fact that, unlike many of his forerunners, he lived in a time of peace, had found a willing sponsor in the form of Mitsukuni (although he resisted becoming a Mito retainer), and, perhaps most importantly of all, had access to the necessary books: first through the collection of Tsujimori Yoshiyuki, with whom he stayed from 1669-74 and where he studied Sanskrit, and later through the My6hoji, where he was resident as chief priest. Ichij6 Kanera had managed to collect what was reputed- to be the best library of his age, but he was in con- stant threat in a time of constant strife and the library was burned before he approached the actual task of commentary on the classics. Scholarship of the kind in which Keichuf excelled, philological rigor, could only really flourish in a time of peace when all the necessarily texts were readily available. One of Keichui's strengths was his willingness to treat all biblio- graphic resources as important, no matter their ideological bias; and it is for precisely this eclecticism and lack of bias that he must be seen as a forerunner of the kokugakusha rather than a central figure in the movement. Although he fully believed in the divine origins of waka and the major role of Susanoo in this emergence (as stated in the preface to the Kokinshu), his main concern was to recreate the language of the Man yoshu, to make it readable and available for the sake of scholarship rather than for reasons of politics or religion. Hence his willingness to investigate a whole series of other classical texts.99 It is here that his commentary on the Ise, Seigo okudan (ca. 1693) is of interest and importance.0'? In contrast to the work on the 99 See Peter Nosco, Remembering Paradise: Nativism and Nostalgia in Eighteenth-Century Japan (Cambridge: Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University, 1990), pp. 49-67, and Hisamatsu Sen'ichi, Keichiiden, Hisamatsu Sen'ichi chosakushiu (Shibund6, 1969), vol. 12. For Keichii's view of waka see the selections from "Zassetsu: Man yo daishoki s6shaku" in Kinsei shinto ron, Zenki kokugaku, ed. Taira Shigemichi and Abe Akio, Nihon shiso taikei 39.310-11. 100 Seigo okudan was not actually published until the early nineteenth century: a four- volume version appeared in 1802 and a five-volume version the following year.</page><page sequence="68">468 RICHARD BOWRING Man nyOshu, one finds very little that can be called either polemical or iconoclastic. He is content to adjudicate here and add a bit there but if this were all that remained of his oeuvre, we would not have the impression of a major debunker of previous positions. This is perhaps important to stress, if only to correct any impression that Keichuf was the harbinger of all that was new."'0 The preface to the four-volume edition of Seigo okudan, for in- stance, is not nearly as antagonistic towards precursors as was Kanera, merely making a few mild suggestions as to authorship and title. While Keichui agrees that the Ise is about Narihira, and that the authorship will forever remain a riddle, he hints that Kiyosuke may have got it right when he suggested in his treatise Fukuro soshi that the title might be connected to the phrase "Isebito no higagoto" or "people from Ise tell tales." There are, he admits, a large number of fictional elements in the work.'02 Perhaps the best way to show how close the commentaries from Kanera, Yuisai, and Keichiu really are, is to give some examples. Kanera's Gukensho deals with the first phrase of the Ise as follows: "Mukashi, otoko uwikauburi shite.'" Even though it deals with matters of the pres- ent, it is written on purpose as a tale about the past. This is not irrational, given that in general terms that which has passed, including "yesterday," is today's past; and last year is this year's past. "Otoko" refers to Middle Captain Narihira. "Uwi" means "first. " "Kauburi" means "rank. " Fifth rank is the first on the lad- der and this refers to the fact that Narihira was receiving his first ranking. It ap- pears in the records as happening in the reign of Ninmyo in Kash6 3(850).1.7. There is another theory that "kauburi" refers to his "coming-of-age." This word is used in this sense in one of the headnotes in the Gosensh , but here we take it to mean "first ranking." In the Nihongi we find 10 ON- apparently read "uwikafuri."103 Hosokawa Yuisai's Ketsugisho, written some one hundred and twenty years later, is very similar in approach: 101 In this context note the article by Thomas J. Harper, " The Tale of Genji in the eigh- teenth century: Keichui, Mabuchi and Norinaga", in 18th Century Japan: Culture and Society, ed. C. A. Gerstle (Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 1989), pp. 106-23, where similar reservations are expressed about the real "newness" of the Genji New Commentaries during the mid- Tokugawa. Harper puts his finger on a number of ideological reasons for this stress on a sense of iconoclasm that the commentaries themselves do not really support. 102 This theory, which can be seen as a variation on the "Ise ya Hyiuga" idea, was to become a favorite one in subsequent commentaries. 103 Takeoka Masao, Ise monogatari zenhy5shaku (Yuibun shoin, 1987), pp. 51-52.</page><page sequence="69">ISE MONOGATARI 469 "Mukashi otoko." "Mukashi" refers to both antiquity and the more recent past. Whatever has passed is called "mukashi" without reference to distance. Today is tomorrow's past and yesterday is today's past. So things that happen now can be said to be past. Thus, in the "Selections of J6onji-dono" [referring to Kanera's Gukensho] it says that "mukashi" can also encompass things that occur in the pres- ent reign. These opening words are most propitious. The preface to the Documents of Antiquity M begins with the concept of the past: "In the past it was Fu Hsi who ruled the Empire." Similarly, the Genji monogatari has the, admittedly, vaguer beginning "In whose reign was it?" It is very significant how this tale uses the word "mukashi" so often. The use of the phrase "ima wa mukashi" later on has the same stylistic force. There is a theory in the Old Commentaries that the phrase "mukashiotoko" refers to Narihira. This we reject. There must be a break be- tween the two words "mukashi" and "otoko". "Otoko" in each section does, however, refer to him. "Uwikaburi shite." Zenk6 [Ichijo Kanera] says this is "first ranking," but San- j6nishi Sane'e's theory has it as "coming-of-age." In the Han Chronicles the phrase MOW;Ml0 contains the reading "uwikaburi," so this seems to be preferable. "Coming-of-age" is the beginning of public life when one's role in the world is de- cided. This work deals with the whole lifespan of Narihira and so treats him from his coming-of-age to the evening of his death. This is why it ends with the poem "Kinofu kefu to wa." 104 Kitamura Kigin's Shusuisho of 1680 quotes Ketsugisho almost ver- batim. Keichui's Seigo okudan begins to expand a little: "Mukashi" refers not to antiquity or the recent past, just things that have oc- curred. The preface to the Documents of Antiquity starts: "In the past Fu Hsi ruled the Empire." Many books, both Chinese and Japanese, start in this manner. This tale in particular starts its sections with the word "mukashi." "Wotoko" refers to Narihira. "Wotoko" is, together with "wotome," a word of respect. "Hiko," "hime," "musuko," "musume": normally "ko" is attached to the male and "me" to the female. This is because "ko" is the common word for a man. In the "Chronicles of the Age of the Gods" there is a note to the effect that "a young man is called 'wotoko;' a young woman 'wotome. ' " This is why the word should be written "wotoko." To write "otoko" is to spell it incorrectly. "Onoko" is similar but means something different. It is used in contradistinction to "menoko". . . "Uhikaburi" means "coming-of-age": The same "uhikaburi" that is written VJJ in the Han Chronicles. In the "Chronicle of K6toku" [in the Nihongi] the word IVALJf is read "uhikaburi," referring to "first ranking," but this is a different word. Note that the word should be written not "uwikaburi" but "uhikaburi." Proof of this can be found in the Kokinshuz "Names-of-things" section where Tsurayuki's poem containing the word "saubi" appears as "ware wa kesa uhi ni zo mitsuru". . .105 104 Takeoka, p. 55. 105 Takeoka, pp. 59-60.</page><page sequence="70">470 RICHARD BOWRING From this it should be clear that everyone is careful to follow and quote precedent, including Keichui. Where Keichui does differ is in the amount of space he is willing to devote to matters of or- thography and a proper concern with reconstructing the classical lexicon. But to avoid leaving the final impression that there was ab- solutely no progression or incremental disagreement in these com- mentaries, perhaps one further example is in order. Dealing with the ticklish question of the phrase "hoi ni wa arade" in Section 4, which even now is the subject of much argument, we have the following from Kanera's Gukensho: "Hoi" is 4Z,. "Hoi ni awade" means "unexpected feelings." In other words, although he was not previously obsessed to this extent, he now fell deeply in love. This A refers to Narihira.'06 Yuisai's Ketsugisho disagrees: "Hoi ni awade" means "not openly." "Ho ni deru" means "to appear" and so "hoi ni awade" means "secretly." Another theory has it that it should be ; The meaning of this is also clear but perhaps "not openly" is better in context. [This is all quoted verbatim from a previous commentary entitled Ise monogatari iseisho fflP by Kiyohara Nobukala 4111 Es (1475-1550)]1o7 Keichui's Seigo okudan has yet another explanation: "Hoi" is * . There are those who annotate to the effect that "ho" in the sense of a is the word meant, but Chinese readings and Japanese readings should not be mixed in this manner. "Hoi ni wa arade" means "not to the extent that he really desired. X108 And so the commentaries proceed, advancing by degrees, but not yet dealing in the kind of character assassination that was on the horizon. Keichui had brought his considerable philological skills to bear on the Ise but he was never openly antagonistic to previous scholarship, preferring to correct kana usage, widen the use of cross-reference to amplify his own understanding of the lexicon, and move with general circumspection. Such genteel behavior was not to last for long, however, and was eventually broken somewhat rudely by Kada Azumamaro EB*A (1669-1736) in his Ise monogatari dojimon 106 Takeoka, p. 124. 107 Takeoka, p. 126. 108 Takeoka, p. 128.</page><page sequence="71">ISE MONOGA TARI 471 tA1w.'09 For the first time we come across strong polemical argu- ment, as good an example as any of the way in which the emergent kokugaku intended radically to revise traditional scholarship. Kada is not particularly known for his philological talents (in this aspect Keichui and Azumamaro's adopted son Arimaro were better schol- ars) but he was a bibliophile and made great efforts to establish the study of ancient ceremony, protocol, and history as a major in- tellectual enterprise. This may or may not have been directly linked to a desire to restore the fortunes of the Fushimi Inari shrine, where his family were hereditary wardens, but in 1728 he petitioned the Bakufu to set up a research institute there. Although the request was not granted, the petition is seen to mark the real beginning of what was later. to be called the kokugaku movement."I0 The format of-Ise monogatari dojimon is specifically designed to pro- voke argument: initially it appears to be on the traditional question- answer pattern, but instead of merely discussing a series of previous views en passant, Azumamaro sets up one particular commentary, Hosokawa Yuisai's Ketsugisho, as the butt of his criticism. There is in fact little sign that he concerned himself with the details of any other commentaries beyond what could be gleaned from Yuisai's work itself. Perhaps this was because he considered Ketsugisho to be a com- pendium of all previous scholarship on the subject; but it is also possible that concentration on a single commentary best suited his aims. Certainly, although his debt to Keicha is plain to see, he never refers to Seigo okudan in overt fashion. It would be wrong, however, to see in Azumamaro the root of all kokugaku's polemical and ideological obsessions. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of his commentary in fact is the emphasis he decides to place on the manabon versions of the Ise. The term manabon usually refers to a kanbun version of a particular work: the Heike monogatari and Soga monogatari manabon come immediately to mind. These ver- sions are not necessarily the "original," although this is generally accepted to be true in the case of the latter. The manabon versions of the Ise are quite a different matter, for they are written in man 'ydgana and contain an abundance of ateji and variant characters. An Ise 109 Apparently never published in the Tokugawa but circulated in hand-written copies, of which there are a fair number. 110 For further details about Kada Azumamaro and kokugaku see Nosco, pp. 72-97.</page><page sequence="72">472 RICHARD BOWRING manabon (and there are some ten exemplars extant) is first men- tioned in Yotsutsuji Yotsunari's Genji commentary Kakaisho in the mid-fourteenth century, where it is used in 21 out of 121 references to the Ise for lexical cross-references. It is mainly for this reason that Ise manabon are thought to date from the early Kamakura. The motivation behind their compilation remains a matter of controversy. Are they simply playful pedantry with examples such as "hakanashi" written 9-9f, "izuko" written IitAi and "yofukaku" as =V? Or are they evidence of an underlying belief that kanji could capture meaning in a way that kana could not? It is difficult to argue that they actually made the text easier to read, because when one version was eventually published in 1643 it was accompanied with a (very necessary) kana gloss. The situation might strike one as absurd, and yet we know of a somewhat similar exercise carried out in 1776 on the Kokinshuz by Kikuchi Shunrin, who selected poems and wrote them down in man )uigana in his Kokin- shui manaji kai At r."' Not only did kanji have a strong appeal to the male mind and hence had a better "look," but difficult textual problems such as the real meaning of "hoi ni wa arade," for in- stance, could be "solved" before the text ever got to the reader: the rewriting itself contained the possibility of quite extensive editorial interpretation. Proof that Azumamaro had a strong preference for the manabon abounds in Dojimon. In the comments on Section 16, for instance, one comes across: I suppose people see a female style here because they are under the mistaken im- pression that the work is by Lady Ise. It should be read in the manabon version first; in that version there is no hint of a female style. It is because the mistake was made of forcibly transforming a male text into a female text that so many differences emerge between the two versions."`2 Similarly, with reference to Section 23: Since it would seem that the manabon is a record of the tale in its old[est] form, it ... See It6 Tetsuo f#* tt, "Ise monogatari manabon ni tsuite," Geibun kenkyii, 8 (1958): 46-59. The only other articles that deal with the motivations behind manabon in general are Ikegami Teiz6 : "Manabon no haigo," Kokugo kokubun 17 (July 1948) and Yamada Toshio OlWlRt "Manabon no igi," Kokugo to kokubungaku (October 1957). 112 Kada zenshui (Yoshikawa k6bunkan, 1928), 1. 100. Also quoted in Katagiri, Kenkyuihen, p. 660.</page><page sequence="73">ISE MONOGATARI 473 should be treated as the foundation text. It is probable that the author wrote it originally in mana and that mistakes were made in reading this mana text when the kana version of the Ise was produced at a later stage.113 This belief that the manabon predated the kana versions of the Ise is somewhat eccentric and is perhaps best explained as an example of Azumamaro's desire to appear iconoclastic: it was a useful weapon. In this sense it goes hand in hand with his attacks on Teika. Such criticisms of such an eminent figure appear very early on in the com- mentaries and are clearly meant to shock: The child asks: Ketsugisho/ quotes Teika's colophon where there is a theory that the work may be Narihira's autobiography. . . . How should we view this? Answer: Perhaps even Teika did not give enough thought to the Ise. He offers us no clear explanation for having aired this ridiculous notion and just leaves us hanging. To say that it is Narihira's autobiography precisely because it talks of "a deformed old man," denies knowledge of waka, and in general denigrates the "man" is ut- terly absurd. Does this tale not contain at the end the very poem, "Kinofu kefu to wa . . . ," that Narihira composed in the face of death? If, despite this, one insists on claiming that it is his autobiography, then are we saying that he finished the whole thing on his deathbed? And while he was alive would he have described himself as "a man of old?" I must say: there are too many matters here that simply have not been thought through.'14 Later on in Section 1, dealing with the problem of whether 1iiE should be read "uhikaburi" or "uwikaburi," we come across: They say it is thanks to Teika's emendations that kana usage is now correct where it used to be incorrect; but this is quite wrong. It is utter nonsense in fact. In what writings, pray, is the old kana incorrect? Post-Teika one can find numerous mistakes. There is a book that purports to transmit Teika's amended orthography. Whether or not the work is a forgery is not clear, but if it is by Teika, then it is clear that he had not the faintest idea about correct usage. Why? Because there is not one orthographic mistake in the Nihongi or the other official histories, and the same goes for books of poetry: the Man y5shu- has not one mistake. This is proof that kana usage was correct in antiquity. When you look at the situation with post-Teika poetry, however, the orthography differs from that in the old poems. Those who take the incorrect as right and the correct as wrong just do not study old books; they just assume that the ancients are wrong and that Teika is right. Teika did not understand old poetry and makes countless mistakes with poems from the Man yjshuI and Kokinshu.

The third unusual aspect of Azumamaro's work concerns the fictionality of the Ise, something which he stressed almost ad nauseam whenever he could. Time and time again one finds him pressing home the point that although some of Narihira's poems are un- doubtedly included in the Ise, we must not look for Narihira behind every section, because he just is not there; and certainly we must not try to identify all the women either. The whole work is a fiction that has been created with the help of a core of poems by Narihira. There is something praiseworthy in this attempt to strip away the layers of previous commentary and open up the basic text again for reexamination: it smacks very much of the kind of thing that his Confucian contemporaries were trying to do. But what is left after the exercise? The feeling remains that he is more concerned with beating down the opposition than in actually giving the text new life. Neither does there seem to be much concern with the possibility that one was merely recreating the lack of cohesion and structure that had produced all the paint ixi the first place. In the end the im- pression is more one of destruction and polemic. It is fair to say that the real significance of Dojimon lay in this adversarial stance rather than in its scholarship. It is not until we reach Kamo no Mabuchi OaAN (1697-1769) and his Ise monogatari ko'i i3. that we really find ourselves on familiar ground in the sense that Mabuchi's work would not be out of place today. There is little of the polemic that clearly motivated Azumamaro. It is perhaps significant that Mabuchi produced Ko'i in 1752-53, some four years before the first draft of Man y ko was completed. It is almost entirely devoid of the propaganda that was to emerge in the last ten years of his career and strengthens the belief that Mabuchi's scholarship can be divided up into fairly clear stages. As Harper has recently shown,"7 Mabuchi's work on the Genji, Genji monogatari shinshaku, is remarkable for being an extremely helpful guide to the ordinary reader, especially where difficult 116 See Nosco, p. 1 17. 117 See Harper, pp. 11 0- 11 .</page><page sequence="75">ISE MONOGATARI 475 poems are concerned. Mabuchi presented a fair copy of it to his sponsor, Tayasu Munetake Ef%ER, as a wedding present for his daughter in 1759. It is doubtful whether Tayasu had actually com- missioned it for this purpose, but this fact may have something to do with its tone. Mabuchi had been working on an Ise commentary since 1740, but it was not ready until 1752.118 Again, the fact that it was written for a benefactor would go some way towards explain- ing the gentle nature of his writing. Ko'i opens with a general eight-point discussion. He reiterates Azumamaro's belief that the work was to be read above all as a fiction (soragoto), so this at one stroke obviates much of previous scholarship that had concentrated on revealing the historical truth behind the text. On the title, he favored the "Ise wa higagoto" theory that the author knew he was producing a fiction and so played fast and loose with poems and contexts. He dated it post- Gosenshut and argued that Lady Ise was not a good candidate because the work was almost certainly written by a man. Most interesting of all, perhaps, is his agreement with Azumamaro that the manabon was the closest we could get to the original: There exists an old text written in mana. The use of characters reminds one of the Man yjsIuf, or perhaps better, the Shinsen man )JshIu. While it uses characters even more playfully than that, it is clearly written by someone who knows the ancient writings; the style is ordered and the meaning clear. So we must state that the story was first written in mana. However, there were places which would have been difficult to read if the use of characters had remained like that, and so that first text must have been rewritten in kana soon after it first appeared.119 Mabuchi's commentary is striking for the almost total lack of overt reference to past theories or even past commentators. It is this that gives rise to the gentle tone that Harper noted in Genji monogatari shinshaku, because Mabuchi is not seen pushing his ideas against anyone in particular; but seen from a different angle it becomes an act of defiance, self-assurance, and independence, as if those who had gone before no longer even deserved passing recognition. So it is that we begin to find developing the kind of commentary that we look for today: not straight philology but rather helpful translations 118 For details see Inoue Minoru - F L, Kamo no Mabuchi no gyoseki to monryui (Kazama shob6, 1966), pp. 133-37, 443-46. 119 Takeoka, pp. 1612-13.</page><page sequence="76">476 RICHARD BOWRING of difficult passages into a modern idiom and a concern that the sec- tions are seen to make sense to the ordinary reader. Take, for exam- ple, the awkward Section 6, "Akutagawa, " and the odd behavior of the woman who asks about the dew. Previous commentaries are fair- ly perfunctory about this puzzle and leave one unsatisfied. Gukensho has: "Seeing something sparkling like a bead of dew on the grass, the woman asks what it is." Shomonsho has: "At this moment they are on the road. Perhaps she asks about the dew because she is not used to such travel. She is in a confused state." Ketsugisho has: "Since it was late at night and she could not see the road, she asked what the dew was." Okudan: "Since she was not used to such a road, she even asked about the dew. " Dojimon has no particular com- ment to make; Mabuchi's Ko 'i has: What kind of person fails to recognize dew? Or is it that her failure to recognize dew in the dark is so described in order to give the feeling of someone very fright- ened at having to travel by the side of a river so far from home at the dead of night, mistaking the flashes of lightning shining here and there on the dew for the eyes of a demon gazing at her? Now then, the text jumps at this point. Let us consider the style of the ancients. How is that no one finds it odd that she asked the question when she could not actually see the dew in the dark? All sections are similar in this regard, but this passage stands out for its use of ellipsis. Each section must be read with great attention. 120 For our purposes, the rest of Tokugawa scholarship can be dealt with quickly. There are over thirty-five different commentaries apart from the ones already mentioned, and they belong to a wide range of scholars from Asai Ry6i to Akinari, Jiun, and Hirata Atsutane.'2' Akinari's "Yoshi ya ashi ya" appeared as an appendix to Ise monogatari ko'i, when it was published in 1793. Motoori Norinaga lectured twice on the Ise (in 1759 and again in 1791-92) but to his regret he never managed to complete a full commentary. From his comments on the subject in "Tamakatsuma," however, we can tell that he agreed with the now-general habit of seeing the work as almost entirely a fiction, but he was upset by Mabuchi's in- sistence that the manabon was the "best" text to use. Although he did accept that it preserved in places a less corrupted version than many contemporary kana texts, the degree of wild licence evident in 120 All quotations here from Takeoka, pp. 166-73. 121 For a useful listing see Vos, pp. 106-114.</page><page sequence="77">ISE MONOGATARI 477 the use of kanji drove him to the conclusion that the manabon was definitely the product of a post-Heian scholar, hence not worth quite the degree of trust that his immediate predecessors seemed to want to place on it. 122 FROM IROGONOMI TO KOSHOKU To find the most interesting examples of how the Ise and Narihira lived on with renewed vigor in the Tokugawa, one has to turn away from scholarly commentaries and look towards the literary and ar- tistic products of the day. The Ise gained a larger audience than ever before in its printed form and its major scenes entered the con- sciousness of every literate Japanese, and probably many more who could not read but who at least knew the provenance of certain key illustrations. As in the Muromachi, the gap between scholarship and fiction was considerable. The image of Narihira that emerges is a direct descendant of the Narihira that we have found in No and Muro- machi fiction. It clearly suited the temperament of the 1680s (when the Ise boom reached its height) to see Narihira as an androgynous figure, the manifestation of sexual union. Indeed, Narihira be- comes the paradigmatic figure of the new age as he charts the move from irogonomi ltf to koshoku St. In the first and only full-length parody, the Nise monogatari fz4 (1644 and subsequent reprintings), it is the form of the Ise rather than Narihira himself that is appropriated. But this was to be an isolated case. All 125 sections of the original are represented and each section is cleverly transposed into its opposite, as courtly ele- gance is reduced by little touches to the mundane world of plain appetites. The result is not tedium but rather a tour de force, mainly because a high proportion of the original phrasing and classical syntax is retained. For anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the Ise, the trick of sudden shifts in register is highly effective, as the ridiculous is smuggled in with the sublime. And the substitu- tion that occurs here is in many cases word for word, showing that 122 "Tamakatsuma," Chapter 5, sections 35-44 in Motoori Norinaga, Nihon shiso taikei 40. 151ff.</page><page sequence="78">478 RICHARD BOWRING a great deal of care has been taken to produce just the right level of "twisting": banality is cleverly avoided.123 This is more than can be said for what followed. In Ise monogatari hirakotoba CY &gt;, 1679, we come across a bowdlerized version; surely the final indignity, as the Ise is rewritten into contemporary Japanese. The prose is simplified and little helpful details, dates, and names, are added. Each poem gets a commentary. What emerges is in fact an entirely different work, in which we are faced with a domestication of the originally "unsafe" text. All problems are nicely ironed out and the whole thing is presented simply as Narihira's biography: each section being prefaced by "Mukashi, Narihira," "Sono nochi, Narihira" or even "Sate, Narihira." A short example should suffice. Section 6, "Akutagawa" is presented as follows: And then, Narihira, finding her difficult to forget and visiting her for some time under awkward circumstances, eventually found his way in; he just about man- aged to steal Takaiko away. He lifted her lightly onto his shoulders and ran away in the dark. They came to the side of a river called the Akutagawa and Takaiko saw the dew glinting on a blade of grass. "What is that?" she asked, but he rushed on without giving her an answer. There was a long way to go and it was getting very late and so he put her down and rested for a while. Meanwhile her brothers had heard about it and chased off after them, eventually catching them. They took Takaiko back with them, and Narihira was left grieving and crestfallen. He stamped his feet and wailed but it was quite useless. Distraught, he composed the poem: ... 124 A simple comparison with a translation of the "original" will show how all the anxiety that we previously identified has been leached out of this version. The transition after the dew passage that so wor- ried Mabuchi has been smoothed out, and not a demon in sight. From this point on, although the title Ise monogatari appears in many different guises, we are really dealing with Narihira as the ar- chetypal sexual hero in modern dress, rather than with the text itself. In some cases poetry disappears altogether. This is clearly linked to the fact that Narihira was now deified in the popular im- 123 For more details and a representative set of translations see J.

Even today he is enshrined in various temples and shrines: the Ariwaradera at Oharano, west of Kyoto; the Kamo Iwamoto jinja, and possibly the Futaiji in Nara Prefecture.125 It is significant, for example, that when Saikaku packs his hero off to the Island of Women at the end of Koshoku ichidai otoko in 1682, listed alongside various implements of sexual gratification is the "Ise monogatari: 200 copies. X X126 Four years later, in 1686, we come across Koshoku Ise monogatari; which keeps roughly to the pattern of the Ise, reducing it to 68 sections, but where the humor is contrived and the substitution mechanical and rather weak. There was a man who loved sex. He did something stupid and couldn't stay in the Capital and so went off, thinking he might find a post in the East. He went with a couple of jokers. They got a bit lost, not having money for the trip. They arrived at a place called Yatsuhashi in Mikawa. It was called Yatsuhashi because in the past a prostitute called Yatsuhashi had fallen for someone else down on their luck who had come to this spot; she had died there, and that was why it was called Ya- tsuhashi. They lay in the shade of a tree that stood on her grave mound and ate their lunch. There were some nice irises blooming nearby and seeing them one of the jokers said, make up a poem with the syllables kakitsubata, a poem about regret working a girl's name in too. "Kami koromo kitsutsu narenishi tsumagi areba hariaishi kane no tabi o shi zo omou." "Wearing paper clothes, I think back with longing to that wild and pro- fligate trip I made, when my favorite Tsumagi was by my side." 127 The final reduction is met with in Shinjitsu Ise monogatari in 1690, where the connection with either Ise or Narihira is extremely thin. Poetry has been completely discarded and we are offered instead twelve short stories in which a rather weak-willed man called Nari- hira has a series of somewhat unlikely sexual encounters. With the equivalent of Section 6, for example, Narihira finds himself being 125 See Matsuda Osamu, "Ise monogatarijuky6shi," Kokubungaku 24.1 (Jan. 1979): 151-58. Matsuda also notes a passage in Asai Ry6i's Edo meishoki which deals with the legends behind a Narihirazuka in Edo, where Narihira is supposed to have died by drowning. Katagiri Y6ichi in Zusetsu: Nihon no koten, Taketori monogatari: Ise monogatari (Shuieisha, 1978), 5.143 claims that the well-known zushi painting of the Kasuga deity in the Futaiji Wil?+ is in fact a representation of Narihira, but I have found no corroboration for such a suggestion. On the other hand the Futaiji is said to have been founded by Narihira himself in 847 on the site of Emperor Heizei's detached palace. 126 Koshoku ichidai otoko, in Ihara Saikaku I, NKBZ 38.301. 127 Yoshida K6ichi, ed., Koshoku Ise monogatari, Koten bunko (Privately printed, 1982), 426.38-39.</page><page sequence="80">480 RICHARD BOWRING carried off on the back of a middle-aged woman who suddenly con- ceives a passion for him.'28 Works of this kind are clearly produced for the market and little else, but they all confirm Narihira's ascent to Tokugawa stardom and they complete the transformation of Narihira into the god of sex- ual union that had begun over four hundred years previously in the tantric explanations of Waka chikenshli. 128 For other examples of Edo works of this kind see Vos, pp. 152ff.</page></plain_text>
