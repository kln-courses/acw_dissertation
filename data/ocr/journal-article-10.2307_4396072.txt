<plain_text><page sequence="1">Establishing Connections Majid H Siddiqi Subaltern Studies VI. Writings on South Asian History and Society edited by Ranajit Guha; Oxford U&gt; 2rsjty Press, Delhi, 1989; pp 335, Rs 200. THIS volume's contents are extremely diverse. Perhaps the best way to inform readers as to why this is so is to refer to three review essays that have appeared on the earlier volumes of this series: by Dipankar Gupta, Rosalind O'Hanlon and Chris Bayly in Peasant Studies, Modern Asian Studies and Journal of Peasant Studies. In these review articles the respective authors have commented upon very nearly all the issues that have in one way or another surfaced in the series. That plenitude of topics, resear- ched or merely commented upon (there is a distinction), makes for the diversity of issues discussed in this, the sixth, volume. It may not be a bad idea to begin to think of the subaltern studies series now as one would of a journal. The quality of the researches and com- mentaries published in this volume, like all preceding ones, is uneven. It has a commen- tary by Veena Das on some of the contribu- tions in the past volumes, another by Susie Tharu published as a response to an article-again a commentary-on feminist fictions (also in this volume) by Julie Stephens. Partha Chatterjee's piece on caste and subaltern consciousness is, again like his earlier, writings, full of self-conscious situating, positioning and rupturing of per- tinent issues (also 'disinterring', as for Dumont). Gautam Bhadra discusses a text, a long poem from mid-nineteenth century Bengal, composed by a village headman from the district of Dinajpur, and dwells upon its contradictions and ambiguities. The three articles I consider worthy of comment are by Ranajit Guha, Sumit Sarkar and Gyanendra Pandey of which the first is a historiographic commentary while the other two are research articles. Guha's article "Dominance without Hegemony and its Historiography' is an at- tempt to show that the liberal-nationalist and colonialist understanding of Indian society and history is embedded in the same intellectual locale: one of shared affinities that followed from similar notions of pro- gress and democracy. Given this, the Indian nationalist struggle, it is Guha's contention, could never really shake off its own history. This -has resulted in a continued subjection of the intellectual lineages of social theory that the Indian intelligentsia has espoused in contemporary times to a paradigm of thought that actually came to be created in the colonial period. Guha wishes that one should break from this and the present article is written at that level of intellectual- political haranguing. Guha has flashes of insight, especially when he attempts to relate the indigenous idioms of domination and political control; as manifest in bhakti, danda and dharma, to the coming about of the colonial states domination. But the text is for the greater part replete with a rather turgid prose style, often almost opaque, and the instruments used to fashion the argu- ment are drawn, without a thought to the question of mixed genres, from all levels of abstraction and empirical observation. A greater sensitivity to the historiographic con- texts of Guha's authorities-among whom are Russell, Lacan, Gandhi, Kosambi, Thompson, Marx and Engels, Hegel, a writer or two from subaltern studies itself, and several others-would have made for a neater and, possibly, a convincing argument. In its present form it remains a long (a hundred pages) meandering, ungainly cen- tipede of an essay, of the take-it-or-leave-it sort. But my own assessment aside, Guha would be happy to hear that it is greatly appreciated by two intelligent students in my seminar group this term and they think the world of it, Or, put differently, Guha has done it again! If I am not being too hasty in saying this, Guha's essay has all the poten- tial for capturing the popular imagination of an always highly-charged student intel- ligentsia and this is one essay that the xerox shops will make a lot of money on. Sumit Sarkar's 'The Kalki-Avatar of Bikrampur: A Village Scandal in Early Twentieth Century Bengal' is in a contrast to Guha's article at several planes. It is only fifty pages, is based upon primary sources research, and focuses on an incident in a village rather than on the concourse of human events that pass for history. Sarkar has described, on the plea of an oblique entry into social history (not from below now but from the side), an episode in the village of Doyhata in which a sadhu, with two untouchable disciples, 'invades' an upper-caste bhadralok household, but with the compliance of the male householder. Sarkar provides us with an engaging thick description of bizarre rituals that follow through the night, including the stripping of the women of the household, the thrusting of a pipe into the vagina of one of them, and the burning of pubic hair. There is also a murder. Sarkar sets this episode in the context of a social milieu in which a variety of behavioural impulses at all levels of society co-existed with different conceptions of time, revelation, anthropomorphic inflex- ions and ritual signification. He does this sensitively, and his account enables the reader to see that a structure of feeling can indeed be got at through an imaginative, but controlled, historical reconstruction of an otherwise obscure episode. As Sarkar, in this essay, reflects often. upon how an episodic history is equally and sometimes more illuminatihg than narrative, sequential, history, his readers would like to know why. His statement that he failed to notice the Doyhata episode when pre-occu- pied with reconstructing the narrative of bhadralok nationalism, does not go far enough in the direction of explaining why. Why one choice and not the other? And, more than that, how might a case be esta- blished for arguing, as Sarkar does, that probing a structure of feeling through an episodic history would help us transcend other kinds of historical crudities (such as conspiracy theories and betrayal models) any more than those other straightforward narrative histories that do not involve con- spiracy theories and the like? More is needed on this. At another time, in another forum, perhaps. Otherwise the success of episodic history, especially European, could easily turn in India into another instance of a mimetic and banal flag-waving, one that would most likely prove to be less universal and less significant for the human sciences than the many versions of narrativist formulae. Gyanendra Pandey's decent-sized article, a standard thirty pages, is an exposition of the British recording of communalism in north India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I have used the words British recording advisedly even though the title of Pandev's paper is 'The Colonial Con- struction of Communalism'. While it may be true that colonial prejudice far too often made for stereotypical and prejudiced cate- gorisation of subject peoples and their behaviour (by now a hack point), commu- nalism in modern India arose as a pheno- menon not all dimensions of which can be captured by an attempt to show that there was a colonial narrative that was concern- ed only or even mainly with law and order. That may well have been how it lodged itself in British thinking and to that cxtent Pandey is justified in offering us this emphasis. His first note says that this article is drawn from his book, to appear soon, and we must not judge his effort at this stage. But what could be said is that the general case in historio- graphy, of establishing connections between form, the content of form, and the substan- tive social realities explored, has yet to be stated. With this volume Ranajit Guha resigns as editor. The series, we are told, will continue. I should like to take the opportunity this review offers of congratulating the editor of a series that, while it may not have stormed any bastions of elite intellectual and/or factional power, has certainly caused more than a ripple in the writing of modern Indian history. As a frequent contributor to this series said to me, "You know, we would not have got the attention we succeeded in getting had we not acted together as a group" Others have already begun to take the cue from .this realpolitik idea but, unfortunately, with far fewer intellectual resources.
