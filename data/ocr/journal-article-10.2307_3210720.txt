T h . .Ne* , ,D .s . .r of The"Negev Desert Emmanuel Anati A RCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH CONDUCTED SINCE 1980 in a 200 square km area of the Negev Desert (coordinates: 120-130/960-980) focused on the mesa-like mountain of Har Karkom and its sur- rounding valleys has led to the discovery of over 1000 archaeological sites. The Har Karkom plateau is thus quite rich in sites, which include many altars, small sanctuaries, groups of menhirs, stone circles, tumuli, and other cultic struc- tures. Artistic expressions are particularly common, including large geoglyphs, or pebble drawings on the rock surface, often representing animals or geometric patterns. This newly dis- covered corpus of rock art at Har Karkom is a most exciting discovery, since the mountain and its surrounding valleys contain the greatest concentration of rock art yet found in the Negev and the Sinai. During the course of the project, a clus- ter of 200 sites with over 40,000 images was recorded. It became clear that the wealth and diversity of representation at Har Karkom made it an ideal locale for the study of the sequence of rock art styles in the Negev. The following report sum- marizes our current understandings. The Context Art exists within a cultural context. Therefore we were particularly careful to note the features associated with the rock art. Some images are found at sites where activities, per- haps of a ceremonial nature, included the burning of large Editors' Note: The language used to refer to wild goats in the Middle East is complicated by the fact that two forms are known, the bezoar (Capra aegagrus) and the ibex (Capra ibex). The ancient distribution of these two wild species is a matter of controversy. While modem ibex are well known inhabitants of the Sinai and Negev, C. aegagrus may have lived there as well, since the domestic goat seems to have been derived from the bezoar. The situation is made even more complex by the possibility of feral forms. The term 'ibex' is used in this article, but it should be noted that the caprine imagery on the rock art does not always provide incontrovertible evidence for one form or the other. 22 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) r</page><page sequence="2">kt I- ,. - , -.,- ?h ' "-' ' -t ' .

In other cases, areas were emptied of pebbles and stones which were re-assembled around the perimeter of the cleared ground. Intense burning is evident in these areas; the color of the rocks has been altered by fire and many stones are flaked in a manner typical of rocks exposed to prolonged heat. Some such areas are over 20 m in diameter. In some cases similarities to the funerary pyres of India can be identified, though, significantly, fragments of bones have not been recovered. Therefore it is uncertain if they had a simi- lar use. Other contexts for the rock art include megalithic struc- tures, stone circles, tumuli, and sites where orthostats were aligned in a deliberate pattern. In some cases the rocks com- prising these monuments were engraved, while in others engravings were found on nearby rocks. It is surprising to find so many traces of human activities on the plateau of Har Karkom, since habitation sites from Holocene times are prac- tically nonexistent in the region. In fact, while the plateau has numerous remains of Palaeolithic habitation in the form of hut basements, evidence of later dwelling structures is scanty and, even when reported, doubtful. It seems most likely that from the Neolithic on, human groups had aban- doned the plateau for the valleys at the foot of the mountain, since remains of over one hundred small villages have been discovered there. A systematic inventory of the rock art reveals recur- rent patterns in the association between cultic structures and representational motifs. For example, a specific style of rock art defined as period IV- A is repeatedly associated with remains which can be dated to the Bronze Age Complex (late Chalcolithic, Early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Mid- dle Bronze Age). Other styles of rock art are consistently related to Thamudic and Nabatean inscriptions, while a dif- ferent style is found with Islamic inscriptions. The typological succession reported here compares favor- ably to the stylistic developments seen in previous studies of rock art from Ramat Matred and Nahal Avdat in the Cen- tral Negev, Wady Hawara in Eastern Sinai, other sites of the Central Sinai, as well as Har Hakom. The succession of the various styles were determined by the sequences of image superposition and by differences in the degree of patination seen in engravings of different periods found on the same rock surface (Anati 1979). A variety of styles were noted. The earliest were produced by hunter/gatherers of the final Pleis- tocene. This tradition of image making that lasted until the Islamic period, thus covered at least 12,000 years. At Har Karkom, most of the rock art patterns are the same as those found before in the Negev Highlands and in several areas of the Egyptian Sinai; others have specific character- istics that set the region apart. Processes of Patination and Erosion In selecting a place for their images, the early artists had a preference for smooth, calcareous surfaces covered by dark, desert patina. This characteristic coat is formed by oxi- dation of the mineral components of the rocks. Depending on the composition of the rock and its exposure to sun and wind, the surface patina can be multi-hued with grada- tions of black, dark gray, brown, or blue. The engravings were produced with stone tools using different techniques: Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) 23</page><page sequence="3">&lt; V The process of erosion attacks hammered engravings more easily where the cortex has been removed. Some engravings have been transformed by the natural process of erosion over the course of millennia, but it is still possible to recognize the goat- like shape from the large curved horns and long body. pecked, polished or incised. In all cases, the main objective was to remove the cortex of the stone, creating a chromatic contrast between the patinated surface and the lighter shades of the rock exposed by engraving. The images created were thus easily decipherable. However, over time the engravings have been reshaded by continuing patination. Engravings on rocks with a whitish interior, would, in a few hundred years, acquire a yellowish cast, becoming brown and an even darker brown as the mil- lennia passed. Finally, they would acquire a shade similar to that of the surrounding surface. The dif- ferent shades of patination of rock engravings found on the same rock surface are a fundamental crite- rion for establishing their relative chronology. In previous studies (Anati 1979, 1987), it was possible to establish a stylistic chronology which relied primarily on the analysis of rock art in the Negev Highlands and in the central Sinai. The research at Har Karkom suggests a few chronological modifications, which will be discussed in this paper. By observing hundreds of surfaces with slight evidence of erosion, it has been possible to identify traces of engraving even though they were almost completely destroyed by natural agents. The pati- nated rock surface constitutes a very hard crust, strongly resistant to the process of erosion. How- ever, man-made incisions remove the protective crust and expose the softer interior rock of the engrav- ings to erosion processes which act upon it more quickly. Some of the engravings have been polished naturally during sandstorms, a process which obscures V The remains of these figures were completely transformed by erosion processes. When designs are erased to this degree they are probably several millennia old, even though a precise date cannot be given. 24 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) ' ,. -9</page><page sequence="4">the original imagery. Faded traces of some of the oldest engrav- ings which have suffered this process can be recognized only by using a strong transverse light. Pecked engravings were sometimes distorted when yet a subsequent process of ero- sion transformed the pecked dots into deep holes. Thus variation in the degree of erosion may constitute, in some cases, an additional feature of chronological value. The Chronological Structure Every pattern of rock art is the product of a well defined mental landscape of the artists, shaped by the resources they depended on for survival. The oldest engravings in the Har Hakom region reflect the concerns of a hunting soci- ety. Subsequently, the introduction of domestic animals and the development of pastoralism gave rise to new motifs which depicted tame livestock as well as the weapons and tools this new lifestyle demanded. In later periods, rock art revealed the existence of specialized economic activities such as trad- ing and caravans. It also showed the meager agriculture practiced in savannah and oasis environments. The typology of weapons and tools represented in each period contribute to the chronological analysis, as do chang- ing styles in animal representation. These stylistic elements are not restricted to Har Karkom, but are common to the entire area of the Negev and Sinai. For example, some forms of wild caprines and other fauna disappear after the early phases of hunters' art, probably at the beginning of the Holocene. When such animals are represented, they are likely to provide a chronological key. For example, the domesti- cated ox appears first in period II and lasts only until period IV-A (from sometime after 7000 BCE until 2000 BCE). Addi- tionally, wild asses are present in period IV-A, while the domestic horse appears only from period IV-B on, proba- bly best placed in the late second millennium. Finally, domestic camels appear only in period IV-C, after 1000 BCE. Inscrip- tions are another source of chronological evaluation, although some of the numerous inscriptions which accompany the later engravings may be older than presently believed; they demand a more thorough-going analysis themselves. Certain schematic patterns or layouts also appear in well defined temporal horizons. Animal figures predominate in some horizons, human figures in others, while in yet a third, signs and markings are more common. The type of associ- ations, the presence or absence of descriptive scenes and the range of subject matter vary from period to period. In some periods, there may be affinities between motifs depicted in the rock art and those on pottery or on other objects of material culture. For some periods, it is possible to draw par- allels between the rock art of Egypt, Arabia, or Mesopotamia with that of the Negev and Sinai. A horizon or phase which displays recurrent characters of association, subject matter, and repetitive patterns of depic- tion, is defined as a "style." Thus, the typology of rock art, like that of pottery or of flint implements, appears to have chronological as well as functional significance. The data we have assembled illustrate a correspondence between certain artistic styles and different ways of life in the desert. Some styles contain scenes, others do not. In the latter cases, the syntax may be based on associations, sequences or recurring combinations of graphemes (graphic elements of specific meaning). Since the beginning of scientific research into rock art, scholars have tended to reject the term "style." However, as this term can be used to define the character of an assemblage, we consider it useful and legitimate. In our view, the stylistic analysis of rock art is of paramount impor- tance in defining the nature of the associated cultural assemblages, just as the analysis of style in classical, medieval or moder art is used. In the Negev and Sinai, as in Arabia and elsewhere, certain stylistic characters correspond to spe- cific moments in the chronological sequence of the art. Rock art is also named "the language of the stones" because it displays messages left by human beings on the rocks. The level of abstraction, symbolism or metaphor varies from one style to another; thus the significance of an image or motif may be deciphered at different levels. The grammatical and syntactical structure of rock art has some general para- digms as well as variations which enable us to distinguish one period from another and the recurrent patterns of one zone from that of other zones. The degree of schematization and abstraction varies, but the elementary structure is always based on the variability of three types of graphemes which are present universally: pictograms, ideograms, and psy- chograms. In some periods, pictograms or figurative images con- stitute the bulk of the evidence which is found. In other periods or horizons, ideograms or symbols are more frequent. Psychograms are exclamations, expressions of sensations and of feelings which are primarily present in the art of hunters, but may appear in that produced by other groups as well. The graphemes constitute the grammar of the art, their combinations and associations make up the syntax. In the Hunting-and-Pastoral styles, which constitute the majority of the rock art in the Negev and Sinai, there are anec- dotal or descriptive scenes. In local periods II-B and IV-B other sequences or associations may prevail as the main syn- tactical form. In the art of Early Hunters, scenes are unknown or very rare. The Sequence of Styles The main criteria for establishing the succession of styles are the superimpositions and the differences in the shades of patina. Style I, attributable to the Early Hunters, has dif- ferent phases characterized by fine or thick lines. Some represent animal figures of varying size; human figures are rare. The style is composed primarily of isolated animals, sequences or associations between pictograms, ideograms, and psychograms. Scenes are, as yet, undocumented. These phases find parallels in Arabia (Anati 1968a, 1972a, 1974). At Kilwa near the border between Jordan and Arabia (Rhotert 1938), the thin line phase (I-A) is older than the thick line phase (I-C), attested in Jordan and in the Central Negev but this is not the case at Har Karkom. Besides the thin line Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) 25</page><page sequence="5">A hunting scene with an archer and two goats from late period III has a brown patina.

Above him is an ideogram similar to a bird. 4 phase at Har Karkom, engravings with entirely pecked surfaces and large animal figures showing a shade of patina identical to that of the surrounding surface (I-B) have also been found. Isolated groups of both wild and domestic animals account for most of the imagery in Period II. Hunting and incipient animal husbandry are the main activities represented here. Single compositions predominate, but scenes are rare. This "Early Hunting and Pastoral" style is contemporary with the Neolithic of the fertile zones. An agricultural Neolithic cul- ture has yet to be identified in the rock art of Near Eastern desert areas. While incipient agriculture was developing in the main river valleys and other fertile regions, hunting and pastoral groups were active in peripheral semi-desertic and desertic areas where water supplies and land quality were not suitable for cultivation. There may have been contacts between Neolithic populations in the well-watered zones and those habiting arid areas. Period II has been tentatively dated between the seventh and the fourth millennium BCE This style is widely dif- fused throughout the Negev and Sinai, as well as in Arabia (Anati 1968a, 1972a, 1974) and Anatolia (Anati 1972b). The animal and human figures show stylistic similarities to the decoration of pre- and proto-literate pottery of Mesopotamia (Goff 1963, figs. 79,87,88,97,136,143,145,174,198,201,202, 494). In the Har Karkom area there is also a schematic style defined as II-B, one probably contemporary to style II-A, but produced by a different population. Primarily composed of ideograms, it is known only at three sites. Style II-B has also been found in the Araba Valley near the copper sources at Timna and Nahal Odem, a fact that suggests the imagery may be related to the activities of early metal surveyors as they explored the region (Anati 1979). In the same time frame, a third style( II-C) is seen at a few sites in the central Negev and in Jordan (Betts 1995:69-76), but this is unknown from Har Karkom. No depictions of weapons or tools occur in the rock art of Period II. All we can say is that the various groups responsible for these engrav- ings probably pursued a lifestyle where the prevailing activity was hunting and the early stages of the domestication of ani- mals. The differences among the stylistic groups make Period II a most heterogeneous horizon. Different traditions are likely to have coexisted in the desert areas of Israel, Sinai and Jordan, thus displaying a situation similar to that found in Central Arabia (Anati 1972a). Period m is more homogeneous than Period II and, despite its long duration, may be considered as a single style from beginning to end. Its systematic composition consists of well- conceived scenes, especially of hunting, where the protagonists are represented naked or dressed in animal skins and the most common weapon is the bow. Dogs assist the hunters and the prey is almost always the ibex. This style is spread all over the Negev, Sinai, and Jordan, with examples found in the desert areas of Egypt as well. The major concentration is found at Har Karkom and in the surrounding zones of the Negev. The Period III style represents a specific way of life. Hunters wear skins, use the bow and arrow, and are assisted by domestic dogs. Based on the stratigraphic evidence, several of these scenes date to the 5th and 4th millennia BCE, though others may be later. They call to mind the descrip- tion in Genesis concerning Ishmael, the son of Hagar, father of the Arab Nation, "...and God was with the lad; and he grew, and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran" (Genesis 2 1:20). Period IV reflects the lifestyle of "Hunting-and-Pastoral" societies. The art is dominated by figures of ibex and domes- tic goats. The main elements of the subject matter are goats, anthropomorphic figures, ostriches and dogs, grouped in simple scenes. Period IV-A engravings in both the Negev and Sinai also include depictions of domestic cattle. However, after this period, this large domesticate vanishes from the rock art of the region. Figures of lions and other wild felids occur with sufficient frequency to raise the pos- sibility that they were particularly common during this period. Period IV-A also contains a category of rock engraving which appears to be a local version typical of Har Karkom. Scenes of cultic activities and of adoration prevail. One of the scenes repeated several times is that of a human being with upraised arms, in a position of worship, in front of a simple line or abstract sign.

The oldest phase represents a hunting scene from period II: a human figure with a double-curved bow is shooting a partially eroded caprine. Below, a different human hand of the same period, but slightly later, has engraved another caprine facing a dog. Still lower on the rock, a third, more schematic caprine, and a dog or cat from period IV-C are lighter than previous phases and darker in patina than a Thamudic inscription that dates to the beginning of our era. In the upper part of the rock a quadruped has a still lighter patina, and lighter still is an Early Arabic inscription below it. V One man holds a goat by the horns while another takes aim with an arrow. Both human figures have a stick or a sword at their belt. At the bottom is a south Semitic inscription with a slightly lighter patina; dated to period IV-C. Finally, a wasm, a recent Bedouin tribal sign, appears below the goat's head. The latest engraver has retouched part of the earlier scene, where it shows a lighter patina. and Sinai the art of this phase shows human figures praying before astral symbols or in front of animals. Other engrav- ings include seven, eight, or ten short lines which may have had numerical values. An exceptional depiction presents a rectangle above which are two rounded shapes. The whole is subdivided into ten parts and appears as some sort of pro- totype of the classical figures of the tablets of the law. The rock art has a very marked development during period IV- A, as elaborated further below. Period IV-B is well known in the central Negev; it is char- acterized by scenes and compositions of ideograms placed near anthropomorphic and animal figures. In the Araba Val- ley at Timna, a magnificent scene of wagons trailed by oxen may be attributed to this horizon (Anati 1979; Rothen- berg 1972). This period is almost totally absent in the area of Har Karkom as well as in other parts of the Sinai and the Negev. It is best associated with the 2nd millennium BCE, a period when the region was very dry and numerous areas 28 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) /JF</page><page sequence="8">A camel with rider, dated to the Islamic period.

Period IV-C is represented by several finds both on the mountain and in the surrounding valleys. Views differ as to when the period began, but it seems to span most of the first millennium BCE and possibly a few centuries of the common era. Almost 200 inscriptions were found in the Har Karkom area, written variously in Thamudic, Nabataean, Lihianite, and other Aramaic dialects, all of which date to the last centuries BCE and the first centuries CE. While periods IV-A and B contain more depictions of ani- mals than human beings, the reverse is true for IV-C. There are more fighting, pastoral, and hunting scenes in this last phase and, for the first time, there are depictions of mounted horsemen. The end of this period is likely to be contempo- rary with period V when Roman and Byzantine influence become evident. It is not unlikely that engravings of late IV- C and period V were produced by two different though contemporary populations. During periods IV-C and V human occupation in this area proliferated with both archaeologi- cal sites and rock art being widely represented. The iconography includes representations of caravans of both horses and camels. As already mentioned, inscriptions are numerous. Besides the Aramaic dialects, a few inscriptions in Greek and Latin were found in the Negev. The Islamic periods (VI and VII) are characterized by an abundance of tribal marks, uasm, and many other schematic representations. Goats and camels are the most common ani- mals depicted. Fighting scenes are frequent though the main activity represented is pastoralism. A number of Arabic inscrip- tions may be dated to the first centuries of the Islamic era; more recent Arabic inscriptions are also known. The rock art of this period loses its earlier finesse. It seems to be the work of nomads from the periphery who often reused, completed, or copied previous engravings. Still, the imagery is widely diffused in the central Negev, the Araba Valley, along the shores of the Red Sea, and in several areas of the northern, central, and southern Sinai. It is also in Saudi Arabia (Slat- tery 1995). Presently, Har Karkom seems to have the richest concentration of rock art in the entire Sinai peninsula. One of its peculiarities is the number of scenes and compo- sitions connected to cultic and ritual activities, more frequent on this mountain than anywhere else in the area. The Rock Art of Period IV-A, Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age One of the most surprising aspects of the concentration of Period IV-A rock art at Har Karkom (847 m) is the virtual absence of stylistic parallels in the surrounding areas. It is known in the Negev Highlands but not at Har Saggi (1006 m), a mountain higher than Har Karkom, about 15 km away, or at Jebel Arif el Naqa (938 m), a mountain about 30 km dis- tant where the rock engravings are very late, all dating from the Roman period on. The abundant assemblage of period IV- A engravings at Har Karkom and surrounding valleys appears to be the result of a deliberate choice of site by the artists. We have already mentioned the repetitive image of the wor- shipper in front of the line and the exceptional engraving known as the "tablets of the law." The ibex was also vener- ated, and its depiction adorns altar-stones with indentations on the top. Other images seem to be connected to myth and legends. They include what may represent masked human beings or spirits, and dancing scenes with composite beings Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) 29</page><page sequence="9">comprised of a human body and an animal head. Some of these depictions may find parallels in the Chalcolithic paint- ings from Tuleilat Ghassul (Cameron 1995, fig. 78). Several chronologically significant features locate this style within the general framework. The main activity por- trayed is pastoralism, though hunting is also well-represented. This is the last period in which domesticated cattle are rep- resented anywhere in the Sinai peninsula, the sole exception being the wheeled wagon at Timna. This singular find is per- haps due to the fact that the site was the location of a slave labor camp, since sites occupied by free tribal populations living in the desert contain no images of oxen after the end of period IV-A. This suggests a date for the images prior to the major phase of desertification which started ca. 2000 BCE. The human figures of period IV-A sometimes hold a metal dagger with a triangular blade and a lunate pommel which may be dated to the 3rd millenium BCE when compared to similar weapons found in archaeological excavations (Yadin 1963). The depictions representing worshippers in front of abstract symbols are found mainly along the trails leading to the plateau of Har Karkom from the surrounding valleys, probably a legacy of pilgrims going up to the mountain. Some of the engravings may represent mythological scenes that echo biblical stories. One composition juxtaposes a serpent and a two-homed staff, a probable indication of its power. Two nearby ideograms likely portray the transformation of the staff into the snake, recalling the scene where God com- jW 'r&lt; ."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^_^^^^KnBiBH \A Worshipers and abstract signs along a trail leading to the plateau from the Western Valley.

It shows the same conceptual subdivision of the ten commandments into three parts: the two uppermost concern God, the middle six relate to society, and the last two engage the individual. Another depiction represents a group of animals, six snakes, one saraf, or poisonous lizard, and two scorpions. It seems to be a pictographic representation of a passage in Deuteronomy (8:14-115), "Remember your God, who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and the saraf where there was no water; who brought forth water out of the rock of flint." Additionally, the rock engraving seems to indicate a pool of water in the nearby wadi bed, thus using the same sequence of events as the biblical account. In and around the mountain are many orthostats or men- hirs (Hebrew, masseboth) near the rock engravings, several of which probably belong to the same period. Sometimes they stand alone, but other times there are groups of masse- both, up to thirty in number. A single massebah is usually larger than the others, positioned in the center of the group. There are also circles and alignments of standing stones. Some of these orthostats have a natural anthropomorphic shape where eyes have been engraved by a human hand. The finds on the mountain include a group of orthostats which belong to the Palaeolithic complex, but most of these monuments likely belong to the BAC period (4th and 3rd millennia BCE). On the plateau are several small private altars as well that date to this period. The only major structure is made up of stone basements, a courtyard and a rectangular platform fac- ing east. Called the "Midianite Temple" (Site HK/24), it has several stone tumuli around it. Another stone-built structure (Site HK/7) probably had funerary func- tions. It is a tower-like structure with a courtyard and is surrounded by tumuli. The rock art of period IV-A appears to relate to a cultic high place, a picto- rial account of the religious activities that went on there. This, however, does not imply that the same is true of the rock engravings of other periods.

In the interior, in front of the fire-place, an engraved stone represents footprints and a caprid. The structure and the rock art were covered by archaeological layers. The cluster was built in an early phase of the Early Bronze Age and reused at the end of Early Bronze Age. It was never reused again after ca. 2000 BCE. As in other parts of the Negev and Sinai, domestic ani- mals were represented in periods I and II, but as a secondary subsistence pursuit to hunting. Pastoralism seems to become the dominant way of life in period IV- A. The stylistic and thematic changes point to the arrival of new populations in this area during the late 4th and the 3rd millennia BCE. All over the Negev and Sinai, this penod is characterized by pas- toralism, first with depictions of domestic cattle, followed by sheep and goat. The frequency of the latter in the rock art seems to indicate that they were one of the main economic resources. At Har Karkom they are usually found in a cul- tic context. Goats are shown with human footprints, a sign of reverence, and at the foot of altars. In Arte Rupestre del Negev e del Sinai (Anati 1979), stylis- tic features led me to propose a date for period IV-A in the 2nd millennium. As analysis of the rock art progressed, new finds, at Har Karkom in particular, indicate an earlier date for period IV-A, as do external archaeological evidence. A tomb from the Early Bronze Age, excavated by K.M. Kenyon at Jericho, contained engravings of quadrupeds, mainly sheep and goat, and human figures, analo- gous to those of period IV-A in the Negev (Kenyon 1957; 1965). This discovery ini- tially raised some questions, but an engraving of two similar human figures found in the excavations of Tell Arad (Amiran 1972) can be confidently dated to the 3rd millennium BCE. At Uvda, depictions similar to those of period IV-A decorate a stone-built structure in front of a fire-place. The engraved slab was partially covered by Bronze Age layers (Avi Eytan, personal ^, communication). It seems therefore, that IV-A may be located within the time range of the BAC period (which includes the late Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Middle .' Bronze Age). A further aspect of this research Near Eastern Archaeology 62:1 (1999) 32</page><page sequence="12">clarified during the last expedition concerns what may be called the "collections of stones." In some fifty sites at Har Karkom peculiar stones were noted, usually natural in shape, reminiscent of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic heads. These stones were collected and grouped, and some- times incised marks representing the eyes, mouth, or the brow ridges were added. Such collections were found at twelve Upper Palaeolthic sites. In twenty-four of fifty cases, they were in sites belonging to the BAC period. In some instances the stones are positioned on the top of plat- forms or other stone structures which may be identified as altars (site HK/173c). The Har Karkom plateau also includes at least thirty-eight non-habitation sites covered by extensive traces of human activities such as the inten- tional arrangement or alignment of small stones. Rock engravings are found at over half of these sites. The area was obviously used for a number of cultic activities for long periods of time. One has the impression that human beings have played with the environment, collecting anthropo- morphic stones, putting up standing menhirs and other stone structures, making geoglyphs or pebble drawings on the ground, producing rock engravings, and building up An eye surrounded by seven lines top and bottom. The lighter patinated sign on the right belongs to a later period. The eye completes the natural shape of the rock which looks like the snout of a quadruped. Period IV-A. alignments and circles of stones. All these monuments still appear today as messages from man to nature on the immen- sity of a silent landscape. Alter the publication of The Mountain of God (Anati 1986a), the sites discovered in the area have more than doubled, con- firming that Har Karkom was a sacred mountain over the course of millennia. Traces of cults, in the form of shrines, and standing stones have been found all over the Sinai penin- sula but nowhere else are so many of these monuments intensely concentrated into one well defined area. In the BAC period, when living sites were located at the foot of the moun- tain, the remains of hundreds of living structures with stone foundations testify to the broad dimension of human groups that came to the foot of Har Karkom, numbering perhaps in the thousands of people. It was the mountain plateau, how- ever, with over 40,000 figures, that they revered as the sacred space. The idea that the rock art was the creation of lazy shep- herds may still hold for the late periods. Many rock engravings of the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic periods appear, at first sight, as depictions done to wile away the time. In the early periods, on the other hand, most of the rock art appears to be part of a well structured conceptual context.
