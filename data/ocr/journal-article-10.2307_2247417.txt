<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-DISCUSSION. SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. By REV. W. L. DAVIDSON. The keeping separate of distinct but allied questions in philo- sophy is a point of the utmost importance, both for the expositor and for the critic. It means clearness and the absence of con- fusion, in the one; it is the greatest safeguard against the worst of logical fallacies, ignoratio elenchi, in the other. The process is essentially Definition. It is the discriminating of things that tend to run together; the drawing of boundary lines, with a firm and steady hand, in this direction and in that. Yet there is nothing commoner than to find woful laxity in this respect, and, consequently, interminable misunderstanding and dispute. Prof. Sidgwick, in his Methods of Ethics, and Mr. Balfour, in his Defenzce of Philosophic Doubt, have both shown us somewhat of the magnitude of the evil; and those who have criticised the critics have nQt been slow with their Tu quoque in return. Nor *is there any department of philosophy where the evil does not reign. Logic, psychology, ethics all come under its influence, and we need hardly mention metaphysics and ontology. It may not be amiss, then, if we here follow out the subject a little; and, as our chief object is to exhibit the working of Logical Method, we shall best perhaps put the matter in the form of a few leading examples. I. A commencement may fitly enough be made with questions that range themselves around a single conception in one distinct province of philosophy: and, as Metaphysics offers a tempting field, let us begin with the notion of Cause. The first question to be asked and to be settled in connexion with Cause is,-What is the import of the notion ? where shall we find its differentia? Much depends upon our determi- nation here, and upon the persistence with which we abide by it. For Cause may stand for at least three different things. It may stand for priority or antecedence; it may be taken in the old Stoical sense (familiarised to the West by Cicero) of efficiency or power; it may be regarded as the sum total of conditions-the aggregate of concauses, positive and negative (the presence of such and such things plus the absence of such and such hindrances or impediments)-emnphasised by Mill. And, according as we strictly adhere to any one of these conceptions or pass indifferently</page><page sequence="2">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 549 from one to the other, we shall maintain clearness in our reason- ing or involve ourselves in ambiguity and mist. A specimen of the prevalent confusion on this preliminary point may be found in the Free-will controversy. Much of the unsatisfactoriness that usually attaches to the conduct of the discussion may be explained by the circumstance that disputants on both sides take for granted that there is nothing equivocal in the leading question, " Are motives causes ? "-whereas the issue greatly turns on the ambiguous word " Cause," and the answer (whether affirmative or negative) means one thing or another according as the term is interpreted in this way or in that. Thus, are we to understand by " cause" Mill's sum-total of conditions? Then, motive must be regarded as the whole of what at any particular moment determines choice, and the common distinction of external and internal motives (on which the diffi- culty really hinges) is seen at once to be fallacious and mis- leading, and the free-will puzzle itself becomes simplified to a great degree. Are we, on the other hand, to take the abstract and analytic view of cause ? are we to accept it as the synonym of efficiency or power? Then, the distinction, between external and internal motives-between the prompting force of things without us and the nature, laws, and principles of the world within-becomes indispensable, and the free-will problem can hardly be else than an enigma. Failure or success in the solution much depends upon the start we make, and the start is in great measure conditioned by our conception of causation. A cognate confusion is seen when cause is identified with "ground " or "reason ": a confusion most conspicuous in the case of beliefs. A man believes so and so, and, in justification, regards it as sufficient to adduce the cause of his b?elief-to state how it originated, under what conditions it was produced. Yet the cause is one thing, the ground or reason is quite another. The latter is wholly rational, and commends itself to our de- liberate acceptance; the former may be altogether irrational, and a knowledge of it may lead to the rejection of that which it originated. A cause explains, a reason justifes; and we miss the point if we offer the one when the other is required. After import comes origin. We have now to settle, whether the conception is derived from volition, or whether we obtain it from experiences of succession; and, if this last, whether physical or psychical succession is the proper type. Rightly also may be raised the question, whether, if we derive the conception from mental experiences, it is legitimate to extend it to the outward world at all. But, while anthropomorphism may thus be dis- cussed-indeed must be discussed, if the issue is to be made at all definite,-the problem must not so be stated as to convey the impression that it is possible for man to gain knowledge which stands out of all relation to himself. It is pure nonsense to inquire, What is Cause apart from, and unrelated to, the human</page><page sequence="3">550 W. L. DAVIDSON: intelligence? If we could solve this puzzle, we should accom- plish the wonderful feat of both being and not being man at the same time. We are next introduced to the principle of causality. The law of Causation-what is it, and how best may it be expressed? No doubt, our answer will most likely follow the attitude we assume with regard to the notion; but not necessarily so. The two inquiries are closely related, but they are by no means identical (any more than the import and the origin of the notion are identical); and only confusion results if we be not careful to separate the treatment. Suppose, then, that we accept the doctrine that a cause is the sum-total of conditions; then the formula consistent with this position is, "1 Every effect has its cause ". We refuse to put it in the indefinite form, " has a cause," because, on the special supposition, there can be only one cause capable of producing-or more strictly of issuing in- an effect; and we express the law as an identical proposition, because effect and cause are only different aspects of the same thing. If, on the other hand, we take cause as the equivalent of agent or producer, then our principle will assume the form, "Every effect has a cause," or "IEverything that begins to be is the result of something adequate to its production ". The proposition is still in reality a verbal one; but, by using the indefinite " a " or " something," cognisance is taken of the fact that there may be a plurality of causes, or that more than one cause may produce the same effect. Tautology is avoided only when we express the law in terms of antecedence; and then our view of the notion is the first of the three above referred to. But part of the difficulty of expressing the formula has refer- ence to the cajusal nexus. Is the simple statement of the fact sufficient, or do we need to introduce the circumstance of neces- sity ? Does " has " or " is " give the whole case, or is " must " indispensable? This is a question that affects the principle, but has not relevance when we simply regard the notion. It may be argued indeed in connexion with genesis (to which we shall advert presently), but its natural place is previous to that discussion; for, as matter of fact, we find that our view of the nature and signification of the principle is more likely to determine our doctrine of genesis than our theory of genesis to shape our view of the principle. Hence again the necessity of keeping the pro- blems scrupulously apart, and of giving them a separate handling. If it be so that cause and effect are relative and correlative, then we can see at once that the necessary union is precisely that which exists between correlatives in general. It is nothing more than given the one-and the other too is given: and there is no greater sense in saying, " Every effect must have a cause," than in saying, " Every height must have a hollow," or " Every parent must have a child". It is also in place here to ask, What is the relation between</page><page sequence="4">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 551 the principle of Causality and the (teleological) principle of Design? Is the latter merely a particular application of the former; and, if so, may not the mode of expressing the one suggest the correct form of expression for the other? If "Design implies a designer" is adequate for the teleologist, is there any- thing inadequate in the corresponding form for the metaphysician, "Effect implies a Cause"? If the nexus in the first case is acknowledged to be that of iinplication, need we suppose it to be anything different in the second? But now, fourthly, comes up the question of genesis. The points involved are similar to those noted under the origin of the notion, but with a difference; and it is this circumstance of a difference that necessitates our sundering the problems. We have here, of course, the alternative of Experience or Intuition; but if we accept the first of these alternatives, we have not only to account for men's firm belief in the uniformity of Causation, we have also to show whether this belief is legitimate or illegi- timate. Hume, as is well known, found the key in Custom; but he thought the very fact of this discovery proved the illegiti- macy of the product. The non-sequitur has not escaped the notice of his successors; and there are few truths more worth insisting upon than this-that an experiential origin to knowledge does not necessarily imply uncertainty and error, much less treachery and deceit. At this point also comes up consideration of proof. What is the evidence for the principle? how best may it be established? If we have here a "I first principle," then Intuition will be suffi- cient criterion, and both the possibility and the need of proof will be denied. But if, in face of the circumstance that there is no unanimity among philosophers either as to the correct expres- sion of the formula or as to the range of its application or indeed as to any other point connected with it, we have difficulty in accepting this solution of the problem,-then, proof of some sort is imperative, and to refuse to meet this requirement is tanta- mount to a confession of impotence. The fifth point confronts us with the range of Causation. Does it hold simply in the external world, among the objects and events of Nature; or does its sway einbrace the region of Mind as well? Is the whole of nature and the whole of mind included; or is a portion of both or of either to be exempted from its opera- tion? We now inevitably touch the subject of miracles and of free-will: but, whatever be the range we allow the principle, the point to be particularly observed is, that our decision need not affect either our statement of the law or our view of the notion. The law may hold and be valid in the physical world, and we may regulate our lives in accordance with it, whatever be our belief as to the miraculous and the supernatural; and philosophers who trace their conception of Cause to Will are precisely those who are most likely to deny the strict operation</page><page sequence="5">552 W. L. DAVIDSON: of the causal law in the sphere of volition. The question of range is altogether a separate problem, and must not be mixed up either with that respecting the import of the notion or with that respecting the meaning and mode of expressing the prin- ciple. Here, then, are no fewer than five questions (or sets of ques- tions) all relating to the same subject, yet each distinct and pos- sessing a value and position of its own. Nor can we, from knowing a writer's solution of one of them, infallibly divine his real attitude in relation to the remainder. Many, like Aristotle and the ancients generally, never handled the principle or law at all: it was mainly in the Latin world that there rose a clear view of the notion. Many, again, like Locke, have accepted the Ciceronian de- finition of the notion ("4A cause is an efficient: we are not, there- fore, to conceive of it as though it were a bare antecedent, but as an efficient antecedent "), while they have traced its origin to "the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of things"; in other words, to experience of the world without us. Many, like Cousin, find the origin of cause in self-conscious- ness or will, while they regard the principle as something existing from the first potentially in the mind, to be afterwards called forth by experience. And many preach the influence of motives in determining action with all the vigour of Necessitarians, who yet refuse to admit that cause and motive are generically the same. The confusion, indeed, is something appalling, and is not equalled perhaps in any other province-save that of Perception. The requirements of logical method have been lamentably neglected, and the resulting inconsistencies and incoherence are simply inevitable. Reference has just been made to Perception. Well-trodden ground need not be re-traversed; but two errors are particularly rife at the present moment, a brief allusion to which may not be inappropriate. One is, the mixing up of the problem of external perception with that other and entirely different problem as to the constitution of the human mind; and the other has reference to the Experientialist's idealism and his philosophical method. As to the first of these, it is common enough to find the ques- tion of external perception argued as though it were the question of Spiritualism versuts Materialism; and the result is simply that which might be expected. " What is the essence of Mind? " is an inquiry of the utmost interest and importance; but determine it in any way you please, and we have not thereby solved the question of Perception; while, on the other hand, our solution of this does not necessarily implicate one particular view of Mind, and the attempt to render the implication necessary is fraught with baneful consequences. So with the second point. The Physicist and the Experiential Idealist (we are told, and told correctly) are to be classed together; for the method of the one is the method of the other, and the</page><page sequence="6">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 553 two have fundamental principles in common. But the Matter of the physicist is something external and independent, and an object of immediate cognition; the external world of the idealist is neither external (in the abstract sense of that term) nor inde- pendent, and what we immediately cognise is states of conscious- ness. Therefore (it is argued), Empirical Science is here in con- tradiction of Experiential Philosophy; and the implication of course is-so much the worse for Philosophy. The rejoinder is obvious enough. The realism of the physicist is precisely that of the practical man, and, if so, has no special bearing whatever on the philosophical position. Now it has been proved, and is generally admitted, that for practical purposes the realism of the plain man or of common sense is equally valid for realist and idealist alike. The attitude of the physicist, therefore, is neither more nor less inconsistent with that of the idealist than is the attitude of the plain man or of the idealist himself when he is dealing with practical affairs. The fallacy is at bottom this:-Because the physicist and the experiential philosopher agree in method and in certain other respects, therefore they agree in everything. It is forgotten that the two have different ends in view; and that this difference of end removes the point of the objection and explains the seeming opposition. If now we turn from Metaphysics to Ethics, we shall find examples abundant in all directions. We have an instance in the perpetual confusing of the ethical with the religious sanction, and another in the mixing up of the ideal of ethical doctrine with the doctrine as it actually exists, and still another in the ten- dency to ignore the discrimination between End and Motive. Yet, who that conisiders it does not see that ethics and religion are two separate things, and that ethics de fctcto is by no means identical with ethics de jure, while the end of an action is very far from being synonymous with the motive of it? It is the " end" of conduct that gives us the test, standard or criterion of it and that determines its absolute value; it is the " motive " that constitutes the moral sanction. It is one thing to ask, Do actions tend simply to the individual's good, or have they refer- ence to the general welfare ? Is self the centre and the measure of them, or do they go beyond self and embrace other selves ? Are they self-regarding. or extra-regarding, interested or disin- terested, personal or benevolent, egoistic or altruistic? It is quite another thing to inquire, Whether they are prompted by a regard for duty, or by desire of pleasure ? by fear of punishment or by longing for reward ? But, perhaps, as good a case as any is seen in the group of ques- tions that range themselves around the central ethical conception, Virtue. As with Cause, so here. First comes the determination of the notion, then the consideration of its origin. The difficulties attaching to the notion are somewhat peculiar, arising partly from the circumstance that virtue as an act must be distinguished from</page><page sequence="7">554 W. L. DAVIDSON: virtue as a habit, and partly from the circumstance that Virtue must be clearly discriminated from Duty. Regarded as an act, the essence of virtue is self-sacrifice, self-abnegation, self-sur- render. But self-sacrifice has no meaning except on the supposi- tion of contending or opposing forces: it is essentially a conflict and a victory. And, as the conflicting forces in human nature are, in the last analysis, two in number-selfishness and unsel- fishness,-Virtue is heroic successful resistance of solicitations to selfishness; a heroism, moreover, which costs us effort, which has merit attaching to it, which we admire and praise, but which we cannot exact as a matter of strict obligation. Antagonisin and effort, on the other hand, disappear when virtue is considered as a formed habit; for it is now the product of repetition, and repetition begets facility and ease and creates in us a disposi- tion towards the particular class of actions: nevertheless, merit, praise and admiration still remain. In like manner, Virtue is not synonymous with Duty. If duty is " what is due," it is that which we may lawfully claim and enforce (officium as opposed to beneficium), and the correlative of " duties " is " rights ". Neither antagonism, therefore, nor merit is an essential characteristic here; for, while we punish or blame a man for neglect of duty, we do not praise or reward him for the discharge of it. To Virtue alone are praise and reward, admiration and esteem confined: there alone does the conjunction properly obtain, el! T7 ape TKat EL1 Tt%v Vatwol?-" if there be any virtue, if there be any praise Now, if clearness as to the notion is a first requisite for profitable discussion, confusion as to the notion is the first observable peculiarity in English ethical disquisitions. Thus Butler, in his Dissertation, nowhere lets us know what exactly he understands by Virtue, although Virtue is the subject of which he is specially treating. The nearest approach to pre- cision is when he sets it down as " justice, veracity, and regard to commnon good". This is a definition by enumeration of particulars; but neither are the particulars exhausted, nor is the essence of the thing defined herein declared. Other things besides justice, veracity and benevolence are species of Virtue; and not all just, honest or benevolent conduct is vir- tuous. Thus, benevolence, if it is simply the natural outflow of an easy, amiable and humane temperament, has nothing of vir- tuous attaching to it; neither are we praised for speaking the truth when there is no temptation to mendacity, or for doing justly when injustice is beyond our reach. Taken generally, " mere absence of crime-where no possibility of crime could be found-does not constitute virtue; and without temptation mere innocence has no merit ". True, indeed, each and all of Butler's particulars may under certain circumstances rise to the height of Virtue, and so may others not included in the summary (such as mercy and humility); but it is just this peculiarity of the cir- cumstances that gives us the defining characteristic, and the</page><page sequence="8">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 555 characteristic is, that here we have unselfishness or self-sacrifice displayed, and, where unselfishness is wanting, we have not Virtue. Had this been observed, it would have spared us the indiscriminate mixing up of virtue, moral rectitude and duty that disfigures the Dissertation, and it would also have given additional point to the discussion about the Moral Faculty. Similarly, apart from clearness as to the notion, no definite result can ever be reached as to the competence of Virtue to stand for the ultimate ethical end. So long as leading terms like Duty, Obligation, Virtue are undifferentiated, dispute must needs be interminable; it is only when a sharp and consistent separa- tion is made that a positive and definite conclusion can be looked for. After the determination of content may be taken up the questiQn of origin; and this, like the other, must be argued on its own independent basis. Here too emerges the question of diy?ity, and it is legitimate to inquire how our view of the one affects our view of the other. One thing, however, is altogether illegitimate, and that is, to take for granted that an experiential origin is ipso facto derogatory, and that " derivative " and " de- graded" are in this connexion synonymous terms. A step further, and we are confronted by the relation between Virtue and Knowledge. This we isolate, not simply because of the historical importance of the question (dating as it does from Socrates), but also, and more especially, because of its great sig- nificance as bearing on life and practice. The question itself, however, assumes-a variety of aspects, according to the meaning we attach to " knowledge " and to " relation ". Is the knowledge thought of identical with intellectual enlightenment; or shall we restrict it to knowledge of the consequences of actions (effects on self, on others, or on both); or does it signify consciousness of what, in any given situation, is the right course to pursue; or is it to be taken as equivalent to wide experience and general culture? In none of these cases perhaps is it proper to say, without qualification, that " knowledge is virtue "1; but in each case it can be shown that the connexion between virtue and knowledge is very intimate, and every aspect of it presses itself upon our notice. Again, we emphasise " relation," and we ask- Is knowledge that which stimulates virtue when it is feeble? I Perhaps it is worth observing that the Socratic dictum that " virtue is knowledge," or, as otherwise expressed in the Protagoras, that " no one errs willingly,"-is differently interpreted according as we view it in the light of "the choice of Hercules," or in the light of the teaching of certain other parts of the Memorabilia and of certain of the Platonic dialogues, or in the light of such a dialogue as the Phwdo. In the first case, it preaches pure Egoistic Hedonism; in the second, it approaches the wider Utili- tarian doctrine; in the third, it counsels contempt of the body and philo- sophic contemplation, leading naturally to mysticism in belief and to asceticism in practice.</page><page sequence="9">556 W. L. DAVIDSON: then it stands in the relation of a cause to- its effect. Or, is it that which enables us to determine the true place of self-sacrifice, when, in cases of conflict, doubts arise as to how far self-abnega- tion is legitimate ? then it exercises the function of a guide, a regulator, a controller. Or, is it that which broadens our views and widens our sympathies? then it assumes the form of an educator, and has significance for Ethics inasmuch as broadened views make for unselfishness, and sympathy lies at the very root of virtue. The whole question is one of complexity, but one of high interest; and, as it touches conduct at so many points, it demands in all its branches the careful consideration of the moralist. So, too, with the fourth inquiry, viz., How fares it with Virtue when we view it in connexion with man's ideal future? In so far as this question is a purely speculative one, many may refuse to enter upon it. But, for all who have faith in the brightness of man's future, and who believe that self-sacrifice is the great means towards the desiderated end, the question is fraught with deep practical import. For the evolutionist, in particular, the consideration of it becomes imperative: and a similar inquiry presents itself to the Christian ethicist-in relation, of course, to the doctrine of immortality and " the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness ". The practical value of it lies here, that men, as matter of fact, are greatly influenced in their conduct by ideals, and the power of an ideal in producing right living depends in turn on the degree in which it can com- mend itself to our acceptance (can fascinate or please), and on the strength of our conviction in the probability of its ultimate realisation. Perhaps we might stop here. But a fifth question becomes legitimate, viz., as to the right adjustment between the virtuous or self-sacrificing part of our nature and the egoistic or self- regarding. And this is the proper place for determining where the standard of adjustment is to be found-whether within (as in the conscience) or without (as in the will of the Deity, the Sovereign, the State, &amp;c.) Now, I do not say that these five questions are all mixed up together in every English ethical treatise; but no English ethical writer is sufficiently careful and distinct at all points, while glar- ing instances of confusion are by no means uncommon. What we want is first a clear handling of the notion; then-after that, and in the light of that-separate discussion of the various allied problems. Only thus may we hope to attain clearness and precision, and to reach the end so much desired-the scientific treatment of the Ethical branch of mental philosophy. II. Closely connected with the preceding, and indeed part of the same process, but here kept distinct for the sake of emphasis, is</page><page sequence="10">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 557 marking the exact sweep or scope of a problem. This takes a twofold meaning according as the problem is (1) one referring to a definite subject, restricted to a single department of knowledge, but liable to being misunderstood because ambiguous in state- ment; or (2) one referring to a subject which has various aspects and so may be treated of in various departments, the particular aspect under consideration being determined by regard to the department in which the question is asked. (1) Suppose the question put, " Is or is not the Will free?" Our first duty is to ascertain, by a critical sifting of the spheres of action, in what spheres Liberty can with plausibility be said to reside and in what spheres it cannot be allowed a footing: otherwise, we run the risk of falling into either of the two extremes-giving an over-extension to the question, or narrowing it too far. We over-extend it, when we fail to perceive that freedonm is conditioned by consciousness, and that all unconscious and all sub-conscious actions are excluded from our consideration. We over-restrict it, when (with Cicero, Kant, and many moderns) we tie down the question to moral liberty-to freedom from the bondage of the animal or lower principles of our nature and submission to the moral law; forgetting that Consciousness is wider than Conscience, and that moral freedom does not exhaust the matter. Again, we over-extend it, when we treat Conscious- ness of freedom as identical with Conviction of freedom; for, not only are the two things entirely different in themselves,' but the latter is far wider than the former. We unduly limit it, when we confine the point to one single kind of act, e.g., deliberation. Before we can hope to attack successfully the problem, " Is the will free?" we must first settle with ourselves the preliminary inquiry, " Where, on the supposition of freedom, are we likely to find it? Similarly with the question, "What is the ultimate ethical end? " Apart from the ambiguity residin-g in the word " end," 2 this is most commonly regarded as equivalent to the other, "What do men consciously set before them as their ultimate 1 Consciousness accompanies an act of choice, Conviction follows it; and, whereas the former is most vivid during a conflict or struggle, it is after the conflict is over and we have lost-in other words, it is when we begin to upbraid ourselves for having yielded to temptation,-that our conviction is strongest that we might have done differently from what we did. More- over, conviction has also a forward reference. I am convinced of my ability to do such and such a thing to-morrow, or to resist an approaching temptation; but alas! when to-morrow comes or the temptation arrives, I find myself powerless. Past and future both belong to conviction; con- sciousness is concerned solely with the present. 2 It may mean (1) that in which we rest satisfied, as when it is said (by Butler, for example) that food is the end of hunger or virtue the end of conscience; or (2) final cause, intended purpose, "primary use and in- tention ". 38</page><page sequence="11">558 W. L. DAVIDSON: end?" But a moment's reflection will suffice to show that the two are by no means identical; and that the ultimate end need not be, and is not, something of which we are unifornly con- scious,-in other words, something that a man aims at, and of set purpose pursues, in every moment of his existence. On the contrary, a man is nothing apart from his character; and, as character is itself in great measure a congeries of habits-as it is a product, a formation, something that is built up through time and energy,-the range of conscious purpose, even in morals, must be limited, and the real actuating principle may in many cases remain unperceived. Moreover, we know from our own experi- ence that the immediate springs of action are manifold and various, and that they stimulate to manifold and various ends. While at one time we are moved by a regard to virtue, we are at other times determined in our conduct by considerations of happiness or pleasure. So that it is not the circumstance of being a uniformly-present conscious motive that characterises the ultimate end: and this consideration must be kept in view if we would determine the character and nature of the summum bonum. In like manner, Psychology and Logic both afford us abundant illustrations; but examples need not be accumulated. (2) The second class of questions is not less important. Take first the Concept or Notion. It falls to the province of Logic to consider the formation of the notion, in so far as it is con- cerned with generalisation, and in so far as it bears upon the two important processes of Definition and Classification-the latter including, or reposing on, Division. But when you go beyond this, and raise the controversy of Realism versus Conceptualism and Nominalism, you have trespassed on Psychology and Meta- physics. It is not otherwise when we turn to Judgment. This subject has well-marked aspects-so many of them logical, so many metaphysical, and so many psychological: but it is the tendency at present to mix them all up together, and to relegate the discussion of them to Logic. Particularly observable is the tendency to raise metaphysical issues-as, for instance, what the ultimate subject in a proposition is-whether a reality or simply an idea; and, if the former, whether the reality of presenta- tion or merely the reality as something given in this, yet in itself unattained and unattainable. This innovation we pro- bably owe to the influence of ilegel, and it can be accepted only if we be prepared like ilegel to identify Logic with Meta- physics. With equal reason might we raise in Logic the discussion as to the Origin of Knowledge, for this question undoubtedly implicates the logical doctrine of Judgment, and, apart from the distinction of analytic and synthetic propositions, could not be argued. But the metaphysics of the subject is one thing, and the logic of it another; and it does not conduce to intelligibility to have them both confounded.</page><page sequence="12">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 559 Equally irrelevant is it in a logical treatise, to raise the ques- tion of the Association of Ideas, or the question as to the Relativity of Knowledge. Although both of these have distinct logical bearings, and although our mode of regarding them will inevitably affect our treatment of Logic itself, nevertheless the full discussion belongs of right to Psychology, and to transfer it to Logic is simply to burden one province with the subject- matter of another, and thereby to remove boundaries and obli- terate distinctions which can alone secure successful exposition. Passing next to Ethics, we are met by similar confusion. Thus, in ethical discussion at the present day, Morality and Free-will are often inextricably blended; and the result has been confusion more confounded. The earlier English moralists knew better. Shaftesbury, the framer of the moral-sense theory, has no handling of the free-will problem at all; and he is followed almost exactly, in this respect, by ilutcheson. Both saw that Conscience, Right and Wrong, Duty, Obligation are what they are whatever be our teaching as to free agency; and one need never expect either clearness or precision in Moral Science until the earlier position be reverted to. Similarly, Ethics and Sociology are near of kin; but they must not be identified. The present tendency is to obliterate the lines of demarcation between them and to absorb the one in the other; and in proportion to the strength of the destructive force should be the vigour of the resistance. Again, leaving Ethics, let the question be asked, "How do we know Mind?" This question is susceptible of various modes of treatment, according to the province in which it is put or to which it is understood to refer. If it is asked in Psychology, then very naturally the answer lays the stress on the subjective or introspective method-on the examination and interrogation of individual consciousness,-and allows only a secondary (albeit a very important) place to the objective method, or attention to the outward expression of mental cha- racteristics in others. If, on the other hand, it is put in con- nexion with Evolution, then the emphasis is necessarily laid on the objective method-on the study of mental expression in other sentient beings, inore particularly in the lower animals or brute creation. And if it be put with special regard to Educa- tion and the teacher, then the objective method still occupies the prominent place; only, the expression watched and the mental growth registered are mainly those of young folk and children, Everywhere, in cases such as these, there is need for a scrupu- lous application of the analytic distinguo; and for want of this, ambiguity creeps in and confusion prevails. So with other branches of mental science. There is chaos at present as to boundary lines; and, although there will always no doubt be a disputable margin at the confines of every province of philosophy, the general territory needs not be other than well-</page><page sequence="13">660 W. L. DAVIDSON: marked, being clearly enough ascertained; and unless this general territory be definitely recognised and strictly guarded, neither clearness nor progress can be looked for or demanded. III. Up to this point we have considered the Separation of Ques- tions as a logical operation having for its end two distinct things, viz., propriety of exposition and security against irrelevant criti- cisms. But there are certain problems that stand by themselves, and ought to be kept distinct, for a further reason. These deal with the Ultimate, and, being ultimate, are simply not to be dis- cussed, but to be started from. A due regard to this fact would have spared us many a dreary page and many a weary hour. The ultimate, however, has two senses. It is either that which is absolutely fundamental, or that which is fundamental only for the particular science or department under consideration. The absolutely fundamental is that beyond which we cannot get, and which (whether we be dealing with philosophy itself or with a special department of it) when we try to reduce it, lands us in contradictions or in vacuity. The relatively fundamental is seen when the ground-principles of one department find their justifi- cation in another; as when Logic reposes on Psychology, or Psychology points back to Metaphysics. Examples of the first alone need here be given. We commence with the doctrine of Relativity (in its sense of Correlativity 1), and we find that this is absolutely fundamental. All conscious experiences implicate a change of state; discrimina- tion is indispensable. But discrimination supposes agreement; without similarity there could be no idea of difference. This then is something that we must simply begin with. When, therefore, we go further and inquire,-Which of the two, at the first start of consciousness, is prior in the order of time? in other words, Does similarity precede difference or difference come before similarity ?-we ask a question that from the very nature of the case admits of no solution. In the primary conscious'ness, according to any idea of consciousness that we are able to for.m, the two elements are found conjoined; and the conjunction is the point of departure for psychological reasoning. Not greatly different is the question, What would our concep- tion of colour be, supposing the primary colours had been other than they are ? We have indeed room for speculation here, but we need never expect a definite or solid result. Our experiences are such and such, whether we will or not; and it is quite hopeless to try to get beyond experience. As we cannot stand upon our own shouiders, it is mere waste of time to speculate on what the 1 The other sense, of course, is the finiteness or limitation of the humLnan faculties.</page><page sequence="14">SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY. 561 consequences would be supposing we could. But if we do specu- late, let us quite understand that the operation has only a dia- lectical value, and let us cease claiming for it the place of a healthy and sober exercise. We have the fundamental, again, in reference to Memory. The trustworthiness of this faculty (when duly limited) is a psycho- logical postulate; and it is so, because we cannot help ourselves. Every attempt to prove it utterly and unconditionally untrust- worthy is glaringly suicidal; for it can only proceed by assuming the veracity of that whose falsity it intends to establish. In the same category is to be placed the dependence of Thought on Language. That the two progress together, that the growth of the one means the growth of the other and vice versa, has 'been proved to demonstration. But to ask whether the one could exist without the other is really to put a meaning- less interrogation. There are no data which, however adroitly manipulated, can authorise us in returning a dogmatic answer. It is nowise different with the celebrated Laws of Thought. These are nothing if they are not fundamental, and, in the last pinch, you can only say they have to be taken for granted. The Mind being what it is, Reasoning can only progress upon certain assumptions: and if you refuse these assumptions, you simply exclude yourself from reasoning, and are made welcome to a substitute, if you can find one. This is altogether different, of course, from the question whether in any given instance these laws have been actually outraged. Not only may this second question be asked, but argued too; yet the final test is precisely those laws that for thought are fundamental. Similarly in Ethics. There is so much of ethical doctrine that we must be contented to start from as a basis. Of this nature are the two principles Self-love and Benevolence (Egoism and Altruism). Each of these is primordial in the human consti- tution; and any attempt to prove the existence of either of them, or to resolve the one into the other, is foredoomed to failure. Hence the collapse of Butler's argument (as developed in the Ser7nons) about what, since Price's time, has come to be known as the Object of Desire-if that argument be taken as a demon- stration of the existence of disinterested regard. That it was so understood by Price, is clear and evident from the Review: but it may very much be doubted whether Butler himself actually intended it to be thus taken. Rather, his attitude (so it seems) was something different. Accepting the existence of both dis- interested and self-regarding motives as facts of our constitution, he set himself to show, by means of his doctrine of desire, that there was really no inconsistency or contrariety between the one fact and the other. Here (he said) is self-love (one fact of our nature) whose object is internal, viz., our own happiness. Here, again, is benevolence (another fact of our nature) whose object is external, viz., the happiness of our fellows. But besides benevo-</page><page sequence="15">562 W. L. DAVIDSON: SEPARATION OF QUESTIONS, ETC. lence, we have other facts of our nature (viz., particular appetites, passions and affections) whose object is external-hunger, for example, whose object is food. In this respect, therefore, bene- volence agrees with these (its object, like theirs, is external), and so has to be affiliated with these. But if so, there can be no greater contrariety between self-love and benevolence than there is between these and self-love. But nobody maintains that there is any contrariety between self-love and these. Therefore, no- body has a right to maintain that there is any contrariety between self-love and benevolence. Whatever may be thought of this as proof of the thing we have supposed Butler to intend, it obviously is no proof of the existence of disinterested motives; and proof of this (in the strict sense of the term) is impossible. Hence also the futility of attempts to reduce Virtue to a single principle of our nature. It is only by sleight of hand that either the pure egoist or the pure altruist is able to give anything like plausibility to his doctrine-only by surreptitiously introducing the element or principle that he began by excluding. Is regard to one's own interest set forth as the sum of virtue? Then this personal regard is forthwith identified with prudence, and pru- dence is used convertibly with self-love, and self-love is defined as a rational principle, and reason for the individual's good incul- cates a regard to others. Or, is the whole benevolence? Then benevolence (we are told) must be taken as directed by reason, and reason includes conscience (" Rationality," as Butler says, " including in this both the discernment of what is right, and a disposition to regulate ourselves by it"), and conscience "dis- cerns" prudence to be right: and there you have it.' One prin- ciple is clearly insufficient. We are neither all egoism nor all altruism, and the great problem of Ethics really is, not how to resolve the one into the other, but how to balance these two principles, neither submerging the one nor over-exalting the other. Some questions then are ultimate, and ought to be treated as such. But these ultimate questions obviously require a test; for, without a test, we run the risk of erecting into the ultimate what- ever we please. What then is the test? It can be but one thing- Experience. That is ultimate which, accepting experience as our guide, cannot be reduced into anything simpler: whenever we can resolve a question into one more fundamental, that (still trusting to experience) is derived. But experience varies; and so questions that are ultimate now may cease to be ultimate 1 It is historically curious that Butler, while rejecting the doctrine that " Benevolelnce is the sum of Virtue " in the Dissertation, frequently accepts it in the Sermons. See, for instance, Ser. XII. and Ser. IX. In this last he says-" That mankind is a community, that we all stand in a relation to each other, that there is a public end and interest of society which each partimilar is obliged to support, is the sum of morals ".</page><page sequence="16">MIND AS A SOCIAL FACTOR. 563 hereafter. Possibly enough, they may: but until they do, we must just accept them as given; and when they do (if ever), the ground, and therefore the justification, of the change will be ex- perience still. A priori reasoning is a help indeed; but only after we have already reached certain conceptions (such as those of mind and human nature) a posteriori. And this we may rest assured of, that whatever reasoning leads us into contradictions or into impenetrable haze is ipso facto stultified: it stands self- condemned as illusory and inept.</page></plain_text>
