Deleuze and studies of Deleuze, however, are also often credited by speculative realists with the turn toward continental realism, a key text being Manuel De Landa, Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy (London: Continuum, 2002). That architectural theory should deal with real architecture seems exceedingly obvious. Yet when we put the last 4$ years of academic anglophone theory in the broader context of writing on architecture, it is striking how often this branch of contem- porary discourse seems to lose its ability to speak about archi- tectural objects themselves. We may attribute this development to the institutional machinery of education and the profession, and to the split between academic discourse and the discourse of practice.1 But perhaps there is a deeper, self-inflicted cause of this muteness that undermines the ability of theory to treat architecture itself, a cause that can be theoretically attacked. The loosely collected (although increasingly fragmenting) philosophical project of speculative realism , in which objected- oriented ontology (OOO) is a pronounced subgroup, aims to overcome precisely what we may see as the philosophical root of architectural theory's muteness: continental anti-realism , a philosophical stance that speculative realists say characterizes the tradition of continental thought as it developed from Kant up through Heidegger and, in varying degrees, into the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Gilles Deleuze.2 Continental anti-realism can crudely be seen, in turn, as be- ginning from a rejection of realism - the view that a mind- independent world of things-in-themselves exists and that we can know it.3 That is, continental anti-realism critiques our ability to speak meaningfully about a mind-independent world, and speculative realism is a critique of this critique. The tradition of continental anti-realism has been the key philosophical guide for architectural theory from Gottfried Semper to Heinrich Wölfflin and August Schmarsow, to Henry van de Velde and Hermann Muthesius, to Christian Norberg- Schulz and Dalibor Veselý, to Peter Eisenman and Jeffrey Kipnis.4 Regardless of the divisions architectural theory has drawn between form and space, expressionism and rational- ism, phenomenology and deconstruction, the speculative real- ist criticism of anti-realism extended to architectural theory would group all of this work under the same, presumably flawed philosophical lineage.

With Sigfried Giedion and Manfredo Tafuri, for example, regardless of the split of the operative and the critical, a speculative realist would find the common anti-realist hinge around which both historical projects revolve - an anti-realism that ultimately subjects the history of architecture to the his- tory of human thought about architecture. Indeed, if the en- deavor of speculative realism were successful, the very project of architectural history and theory as we have received it today - so rooted in transcendental philosophy and the acknowl- edgment of critical historical and theoretical limits - could be thrown into doubt. Of course, much hangs on speculative re- alism^ highly questionable ability to hold over two centuries of philosophy together under one label. Applied to a specific field of theoretical and historical investigation, this becomes an even more dubious task. Nonetheless, speculative realism has, at the very least, found a way to clearly frame a critique of the philosophical support of architectural history and theory, and it should be engaged with more than a dismissive smirk. For the speculative realist, the anti-realist tendency in continental philosophy is substantially shaped by Kant's re- jection of dogmatic metaphysics } Dogmatic metaphysicians held that the existence of God, of human souls, and the world as a whole - all of which transcend the empirical, perceptual abilities of any individual - are nonetheless knowable with certainty through rational thought. Against these beliefs, Kant argues that finite human beings cannot actually know whether these transcendent entities exist with any certainty because rational thought can prove both that they do and do not exist. But importantly, the Kantian rejection of the real- ism of dogmatic metaphysics does not lead simply to an affir- mation of the other extreme of subjective idealism - the view that nothing exists outside of the solipsistic mind.6 Instead, Kant attempts to reject the poles of realism (a perfectly know- able external world) and of subjective idealism (subjects con- fined only to knowledge of themselves) and seeks a mediate path between the two by putting emphasis on the conditions that form our access to the world.7 Philosophy then aims to discover the transcendental limits of our ability to know, those conditions that frame our experience, and the possibilities and extents of questions that can be meaningfully asked. In short, continental anti-realism holds that thinking and being are inseparable. It is this stance that Quentin Meillassoux labels correlationism - "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and be- ing, and never to either term considered apart from the other."8 108 Log K</page><page sequence="3">9.

Correlationism, then, describes any philosophy that rejects the possibility of thinking a being that is independent of thought.9 Anti-realist correlationism traps finite human existence within a "correlational circle" that makes it impossible to separate what is thought about from the process of thinking: "If you speak about something, you speak about something that is given to you, and posited by you."10 That is, "thought cannot escape from itself."11 Any thing that is thought is always part of our thought (and likewise our thought is always about some thing).12 Speculative realism critiques the anti-realist stance of correlationism by speculating on the nature of real, absolute existence outside of and independent of the human mind. But this investigation of the external world must avoid revert- ing to either a precriticai dogmatic metaphysics of necessarily absolute entities or a naïve realism based on a correspondence model of truth, which simply affirms the absoluteness of em- pirical evidence. The variations in ontological proposals that seek to meet this challenge of creating a new form of real- ism are diverse: object-oriented philosophy, onticology, alien phenomenology, flat ontology, and speculative materialism, to name a few. Each proposes a different mereology (part/whole relation) and, more generally, a different way of understand- ing exactly what is wrong with correlationism and how it can be overcome. However, a view of the landscape of speculative realism can be constructed through two of its most discussed ontologies, those of Meillassoux and Graham Harman. Graham Harman: Withdrawal, Tool-Being , and The Quadruple Object According to Harman, while objects appear to us as sensual, unified things Ça table, say) with sensual qualities (wooden, brown, four-legged, etc.), there are always certain qualities of an object that are in excess of the sensuality that character- izes our experience. These are real qualities, different from sensual qualities. There is also a further dimension of objects, real objects, whose nature it is to withdraw from all relations, including relations with humans.1* This nonrelationality of real objects is the fundamental postulate of Harman's object- oriented philosophy (the term object-oriented ontology was coined by Levi Bryant as an umbrella for several approaches within speculative realism, of which Harman's is one).14 Harman's claim that there are always both sensually present objects and withdrawn real objects is developed largely through his reading of Heidegger, and in particular of the analysis of tools in Being and Time According to 109 Log K</page><page sequence="4">16. The modes of being are Dasein (hu- mans), Zuhandensein (tools), Vorhandensein (broken tools), Gestell (technology), and Werksein (art). We might also add the being of animals, which Heidegger describes as "world poor" ( weltarm ), to this list. In ad- dition to Being and Time , see "The Question Concerning Technology," in The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays , trans. William Lovitt (New York: Harper Perennial, 1977), 3-35; "Origin of the Work of Art," in Poetry, Language, Thought , trans.

William McNeill and Nicholas Walker (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995), 186-265. 17. Graham Harman, Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects (Chicago: Open Court, 2002). 18. Harman has repeatedly insisted that Heidegger recognizes only two modes of being: Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit (see, for example, Quadruple Object , 39, 57-60). Harman is able to make this claim because he simply asserts that tool-being should not just apply to tools, but rather to all things, and collapses all distinctions of presence and absence into the specific variation of this play in Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit. He accomplishes these tasks by mapping terminology from the analysis of Dasein onto the analysis of tools - that is, he writes, "all objects have the status of being- in-the-world" (a term that Heidegger uses metonymically to Dasein) and "equipment itself is existential" (again, a term reserved for the being of Dasein) ( Tool-Being , 35, 39). These sorts of claims are laden throughout the first chapter of Tool-Being , yet I can find no convincing reason to believe them either as interpretations of Heidegger (as they are obviously inaccurate - Harman asserts that the existentials of Dasein and the categories are the same, when Heidegger labors over the distinction; see Being in Time , 67-77) or as the blunt ontological assertion that Harman repeatedly makes (as I can find nowhere in Harman's writing where he puts forth an argument for why humans and tools should be treated as ontologically the same). Doing away with the distinction of tools and Dasein then makes it possible for Harman to pave over any distinctions in Heidegger's thought between the ways in which presence and absence interact in humans, art, nature, and technology, as opposed to their condition in tools. Again, regardless of whether this is ontologically correct, it seems dubious to present this as an interpretation of Heidegger or, espe- cially, to assert that Heidegger was reduc- tive (rather, it is Harman's interpretation that is reductive). Beyond this unwarranted collapse of tools and Dasein, and of pres- ence and absence, into Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit , in Tool-Being Harman treats the divide between tool and broken Heidegger, there are different modes of being. Humans, tools, and broken tools (and in his later writings, also technology and art) are all characterized by the particular ways in which they exist.16 For Heidegger, what is interesting about the way tools exist is that they are inconspicuous, particularly when in use. Tools recede from our view when they function as tools, because the nature of the tool is to become an extension of our own concern and thus not to appear as an individual, iso- lated object. For example, the hammer becomes an extension of the carpenter, the car of the driver, and the glove of the baseball player. Heidegger labels this mode of being as handi- ness ( Zuhandenheit ). However, when a tool breaks, when it stops working, it becomes a conspicuous object. When the head comes off the hammer, the keys to the car are lost, or the webbing of the glove breaks, the tool's existence as handy is transformed into on-handness QVorhandenheit ). Rather than a mode of being characterized by withdrawal and absence, the mode of being of the broken tool is a type of presence. In Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects , Harman argues that we must extend Heidegger's understand- ing of the way in which tools/broken tools exist ( tool-being ) to include every entity, since the dual structure of handiness and on-handness, of inconspicuous withdrawal and conspic- uous presence, describes a fundamental ontological condi- tion, not just an issue of pragmatic use.17 In fact, handiness and on-handness describe not two types of entities (tools and broken tools) but rather the two tendencies in all existence. Harman suggests that almost everything Heidegger says is a repetition of this fundamental dualism in some form, and in Tool-Being he dismantles the substantial division Heidegger maintains between human existence ( Dasein ) and tool ex- istence by understanding both as having the same ontologi- cal structure. Regardless of whether Harman's ontological claim is defensible, it should be noted that this is an idiosyn- cratic and (purposefully) revisionary reading of Heidegger.18 Nonetheless, we get a clear definition of Harman's philo- sophical project: "The idea of an object-oriented philosophy is the idea of an ontology that would retain the structure of Heidegger's fundamental dualism, but would develop it to the point where concrete entities again become a central philo- sophical problem."19 Harman goes on to argue in Tool-Being that Heidegger overlays the distinction of tool and broken tool with a second distinction to create a fourfold structure. Although Harman rejects the specifics of Heidegger's fourfold, he develops a 110 Log 11</page><page sequence="5">tool as equivalent to the divide between the ontological and the ontic. This is yet another collapse of distinctions that, while demonstrably incongruous with Heidegger, enables Harman to eliminate any issues that Heidegger is attempting to show as unique to Dasein's relationship to the world, to ignore the essential character of the ontic/ontological divide as a question of authenticity, and to dismiss pragmatic readings of the tool analysis as incorrect readings of Heidegger. From this, Harman can insist that typical readings of the tool analysis make the mistake of thinking it argues for the relationality of all things when it really argues for nonrelationality and withdrawal. Again, regardless of whether his interpretation is right on this specific point (I do not think it is), Harman's repeated insistence that the tool analysis shows that it is wrong to privilege the finitude (facticity) of Dasein, as Heidegger does, is completely specious. Asserting that all objects have the same burden as Dasein is Harman's way of dismissing the correlational circle and, as mentioned above, avoiding the issue of authenticity in Heidegger. 19.

After laying out the fourfold structure in The Quadruple Object , Harman rapidly introduces a dizzying array of terminology for the 10 types of relationships made possible by this fourfold structure. Other accounts of these relations can be found sprinkled throughout Guerrilla Metaphysics , as well as in "On Vicarious Causation," Collapse 1 (March 2007): 187-221 and Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics (Melbourne: re.press, 2009), 190-221.

For Harman, real objects only make contact indirectly through sensual objects: "Two entities make contact only on the interior of a third, and it is an asymmetrical contact between a real object and an inten- tional one"; Harman, "Time, Space, Essence, and Eidos: A New Theory of Causation," Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy 6, no. 1 (2010): 1-17. new fourfold ontology. Drawing in particular on Leibniz and Husserl (whose ideas he works through in Guerrilla Metaphysics) , in addition to Heidegger, in The Quadruple Object Harman reworks the tool/broken tool dualism in terms of a real/sensual dualism that is crossed with another: object/qualities.20 This generates an ontology of four related poles already mentioned above: real object, sensual object, real qualities, sensual qualities. Thus, by Harman's account, while there are many different objects in the universe, there are only two kinds: "the real object that withdraws from all experience, and the sensual object that exists only in expe- rience."21 There are likewise only two kinds of qualities - sensual qualities that we experience and real qualities that withdraw. All other differences between objects or qualities are only differences of degree.22 Harman sets his version of OOO against reductive mate- rialism. He pairs his critique of correlationism's tendency to overmine objects by thinking them only insofar as they relate to the human mind with a critique of ontologies that under- mine the existence of individuals in favor of a deeper reality of flows, becomings, or subatomic particles.2* For Harman, real objects should "be defined only by their autonomous reality," which is manifest both in objects' emergence as something "over and above the pieces" and in their tendency to withhold themselves "from relations with other entities."24 Because these real objects withdraw, we can only speculate on the real "non-relational surplus" that characterizes them.25 Thus, what ultimately marks Harman's version of OOO and of spec- ulative realism is, first, the withdrawal of all real objects (that is, the nonrelationality of real objects) and, second, a rejection of the correlational circle via the insistence that the conditions of human relationships to the world are no different than those established between any two objects.26 All relationships between objects are only sensual (that is, experiential/inten- tional) and all sensual relations - of the cotton ball and fire as much as of the human and the hammer - are only partial and finite, since the real objects always withdraw.27 Quentin Meillassoux: Factiality and Against Finitude If we can summarize the propositions of correlationism as fundamentally twofold - first, the correlational circle af- firms the inseparability of thought and being, and, second, absolutes are not thinkable, making finitude a fundamen- tal characteristic of existence - it is the former that Harman rejects and the latter that he keeps. Meillassoux, in contrast, 111 Log 33</page><page sequence="6">Positing the sensual object as the third thing that provides contact between two real objects that do not touch then requires Harman to give an account of the relationship of the real object and sensual (intentional) object, which he calls sincerity or conjunction ("Vicarious Causation," 205). This is not a "full-blown connection" but rather a relationship that can itself be converted into an object (the sensual object) (208). Indeed, "every relation is itself an object" (207). I see at least two problems with this series of assertions. First, intentionality serves as the model both for the relationship of the real and sensual objects and for sensual objects themselves (leading to an infinite regress of relations and objects that connect the real and sensual, thus providing no account of how the nonrelational real is related to the sensual). Second and more problematically, the model is adapted from a Husserlian analysis of human intentionality, and thus there is no apparent reason to assume one can transfer this account of correlation to the relationship of all objects. As with Harman's mapping of the structure of tools and Dasein, the problem is not that this is necessarily not true, but rather that it is not actually a response to the correlational circle. It is merely a handwave and blind assertion. 28. See Meillassoux, "Iteration," 1, 8-10. 29. Meillassoux, After Finitude , 27. 50. Ibid., 9. 31. Ibid., 10. 32. Ibid., 26-27. 33.

The ancestral objects whose existence these state- ments assert predate any consciousness and are given to us through arche-fossils - "materials indicating the existence of an ancestral reality or event; one that is anterior to terrestrial life."*1 It is, Meillassoux says, the philosopher who should be "astonished" by the straightforward meaning of the ancestral statement based on arche-fossils because it leads to a paradox: "How can a being manifest being's anteriority to manifesta- tion?"*2 Accepting the correlational circle requires us to reject dogmatic metaphysics and naive realism, but at the same time we must be able to think existence outside of thought in order to make ancestral statements legible.** According to Meillassoux, there are two routes to solv- ing the paradox of the arche-fossil. Both are modifications of the anti- speculative correlationist position, which says that one cannot think absolute being that is outside of thought. The first route is what Meillassoux labels subjectalism. Corre- lationism does not actually rule out the possibility of all absolutization, for one could absolutize the correlation of human and world itself. That is, if "what is asubjective can- not be," one can also make a positive, absolute ontological claim: "To be is to be a correlate."*4 This is precisely what subjectalism does. It takes the finitude of thought as a sign of an ontological condition; the subjective is the fundamen- tal form of existence. It is a position that, for Meillassoux, characterizes the idealism of Hegel (absolutizing "reason") 112 Log ÌÌ</page><page sequence="7">35. Meillassoux, "Iteration," 8. 36. Ibid., 4. 37. Ibid., 7. 38. Harman's minimal published response is lacking: "Meillassoux complains that this leaves only a 'difference of degree' between sand grains and humans. Yet it is unclear why this is prima facie more absurd than Meillassoux's own theory" ("Current State," 25). In responding specifically to the claim that he is merely anthropomorphiz- ing everything, Harman writes, "The point is not to inject tiny human minds backwards into inanimate dirt, but the reverse: to show that what we call minds are simply enhanced versions of the crude contact with intentional objects found in any relation whatever" ("Time, Space, Essence, and Eidos," 15). This strikes me as a deeply unsatisfying answer because it does not actually address the critique. Harman in lectures has described the interaction of things like rocks as having some sort of very low-level consciousness. This panpsychism (and this is undeniably what it is, regardless of Harman's neologizing) is precisely why Zizek has called Harman's object-oriented philosophy "spiritualist" (Less Than Nothing , 640). Regardless of whether subjectalism is a proper category, it seems the charge of Harman's anthro- pomorphism still stands. I do not see how Harman can get around it, since his phi- losophy begins from collapsing Heidegger's ontological distinction of Dasein and tools/ broken tools. However, the forthcoming second edition of Harman's book Quentin Meillassoux: Philosophy in the Making (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015) does promise a response. 39. See Heidegger, Being and Time , 33-34, 82-83, 176-79. Also see Heidegger's 1921-2 lectures, published as Phenomenological Interpretations of Aristotle: Initiation in Phenomenological Research , trans. Richard Rojcewicz (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), in which he refers to Dasein as "factical life" (61fï). 40. See Meillassoux, After Finitude, 50-81. For more detailed discussion of this argument, see Peter Hallward, "Anything Is Possible: A Reading of Quentin Meillassoux's After Finitude ," in Bryant et al., Speculative Turn , 130-41. Also, Meillassoux restates this argument in "Iteration," 9-11. as well as the vitalism of Nietzsche (absolutizing the "will to power") and Deleuze (absolutizing the "larval subject"). For subjectalism, "thought thinks thought as the absolute," and thus the ancestral statement is true insofar as it is an aspect of absolute thought.*5 Subjectalism, for Meillassoux, ultimately fails. It tries to deny correlationism's anthropocentrism, but "this refusal ... in fact leads only to an anthropomorphism that consists in the illusion of seeing in every reality (even inorganic real- ity) subjective traits the experience of which is in fact en- tirely human, merely varying their degree (an equally human act of imagination) ."*6 It should be clear, then, that what Meillassoux is describing as subjectalism - a rejection of the correlational circle by absolutizing the condition of human finitude - is precisely what characterizes Harman's object- oriented philosophy. Harman, Meillassoux says, anthropo- morphizes and vitalizes all objects by hypostasizing "our subjective relation to things by projecting it into the things themselves."*7 He takes the condition of being a human and simply projects it onto all relationships between all objects.*8 Beyond the charge of anthropomorphism, Meillassoux suggests that correlationism can and does respond to subjec- talism' s recovery of absolutism by way of a second argument based on correlational facticity. To reject subjectalism's abso- lutization of the correlate, correlationism must show that correlation itself is not necessary; correlationism must show that there is no absolute reason for itself. Meillassoux, like Harman, follows a Heideggerian argument to this effect. Human existence is thrown into a concrete, historical position that it did not choose and does not totally control. This condition, which Heidegger calls facticity, is not merely the collection of facts about the situation into which we are thrown (for example, facts of nationality, class, generation, technological surrounds, etc.) but is further the factual- ity of these facts - it is the structure that makes facts pos- sible. Facticity is the condition of being-in-the-world, such that we understand ourselves to be mutually bound up in our existence with other entities.*9 Facts that matter are always already given to human life, and facticity names the brute givenness of this condition. In the core chapter of After Finitude , Meillassoux aims to radicalize the human condition of facticity by converting it into what he calls the principle of factiality. The argument of this chapter (in highly truncated form) goes as follows.40 The facticity of all facts means that it is impossible to give a m Log 33</page><page sequence="8">41. Meillassoux, "Iteration," 9. 42. This facticity (along with an appeal to Kant's refutation of the ontological argument for the existence of God) shows that "a necessary entity is impos- sible" (Meillassoux, After Finitude, 67). Meillassoux complicates this discussion by distinguishing contingencies, facts, and the arche-fact ("Iteration," 9). 4?. Meillassoux, After Finitude, 80. 44. From this, we can further say that "it is necessary that there be something rather than nothing because it is necessarily contingent that there is something rather than something else" (Ibid., 76). We can think the contingency of specific facts/enti- ties but not the contingency of existence as such. Thus not only is contingency necessary, but further contingent entities must exist. 45.

While this facticity itself may be treated as a fact - that is, "my existence is finite" - the fact of facticity can- not be grounded in something ultimately necessary because it is likewise a brute given fact. Thus, our correlation with the world cannot be surpassed, but it also cannot be treated as a necessary absolute.41 Therefore, we have no way out of the contingency of each and every fact.42 Things only exist con- tingently and so the positive ontological principle of factial- ity can be stated thus: "Only facticity is not factual - viz. only the contingency of what is, is not itself contingent."4* It is not the correlate that is absolute but rather the facticity of corre- lation that is. That is, only contingency is necessary.44 For Meillassoux, then, the ancestral object is made think- able because existence outside of thought can be thought in the form of an absolute: the necessity of contingency. Ultimately, the way in which Meillassoux has recovered an absolute has profound effects on ontology and ethics. For him, the acknowl- edgment of the fundamental principle of factiality leads us to the realization that "everything and every world is without reason, and is thereby capable of actually becoming otherwise without reason "4* Meillassoux does make arguments for why things appear to be stable, but as with Harman, regardless of the plausibility of these arguments, we can see where this ontology ultimately leads us: "We [must] begin to understand that in reply to those metaphysical questions that ask why the world is thus and not otherwise, the response 'for no reason' is a genuine answer. Instead of laughing or smiling at questions like 'Where do we come from?', 'Why do we exist?', we should ponder the remarkable fact that the replies 'From nothing. For nothing' really are answers."46 OOO and Architectural Metaphors Regardless of how exactly we categorize the differing phi- losophies of Harman, Meillassoux, and the many others asso- ciated with speculative realism, it is clear that what has been labeled "the OOO branch" (and Harman's work in particu- lar) has garnered most of the initial attention in architectural discourse. In recent architectural theory that draws on OOO, there is a tendency to set up the appeal to this philosophy as part of a move from thinking in terms of continuous flows and fields (which has been associated with Deleuze) to think- ing through discrete objects.47 The idea seems to be that the OOO account of withdrawal and nonrelationality implies a 114 Log M</page><page sequence="9">48. It needs to be said that Deleuze never suggested getting rid of stratification. In "Geology of Morals," he and Félix Guattari, in the voice of Professor Challenger, describe "a very important, inevitable phenomenon that is beneficial in many respects and unfortunate in many others: stratification"; A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia , trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), 40. Wiscombe, for example, writes, "Architectural elements are pulled apart and de -stratified so they can be reassembled to produce refreshing chunkiness and tension. In order to achieve this effect, architectural elements must interact - empathize with one another - rather than remaining fully autonomous. Things can nestle, squish, or envelop other things, as long as they do not fuse together or damage one another" ("Discreteness," 37). Wiscombe is merely describing architecture as a formal metaphor for the idea of a flat ontology (just as he shows im- ages of architecture that are metaphorically related to Tristan Garcia's metaphor of the sack). It is not that his formal analysis and description of architectural projects are problematic - on the contrary, they are provocative and engaging - but rather that any substantial connection to OOO is tenuous. OOO here is merely a justification for rethinking mereological relationships in architectural form. 49. See Heidegger, "Origin of the Work of Art," 40ff. 50. For reason to think that the metaphors of OOO might not be the best to simply appropriate, see Alexander R. Galloway, "The Poverty of Philosophy: Realism and Post-Fordism," Critical Inquiry 39, no. 2 (Winter 201?): 347-66. switch from a lexicon of folds, gradients, and continuity to one of breaks, patching, and discreteness.48 But the ontological evaluation that all objects withdraw is not yet a design theory, nor is it even a tool with which we can pass post hoc judgment on built work. Nonrelationality is not yet a normative guide to what sort of architecture the architect should or could produce. If it is a real object, it will withdraw, and if it is a sensual object, it will be relational. This is not a design proposition; it is a proposition about the way things already are. To think that this (or any exploration of ontology) is prima facie going to help us decide whether, for example, interior and exterior should be related or dis- connected - to somehow believe that in a Deleuzian world exteriors should flow into interiors, whereas in a Harmanian world the nonrelationality of objects means interiors and ex- teriors should be disconnected - is a hackneyed application of philosophy at best. There must be more steps in the move from ontology's evaluation of the nature of existence to a normative guide for design, or even for theoretical or histori- cal evaluation. In fact, Harman puts forward just such a suggestion for making this move in the discussion published in this issue of Log [see page 86]. If OOO has anything useful for architec- tural design, he says, it is only metaphorical. According to OOO, it would make no sense to suggest that designers can make objects that withdraw more or less, since all real objects must necessarily be entirely withdrawn and nonrelational. If all real objects are nonrelational, then real objects (architec- tural or not) never actually fuse together, regardless of how they appear. The best the designer could do is to make inten- tional (sensual) objects that lay bare the device of nonrela- tionality, which paradoxically means laying bare the device of hiddenness and withdrawal - a technique akin to Heidegger's concern for art to make absence present as absence.49 Thus, it seems that any purposeful attempt to design architecture af- ter OOO merely means to make architecture that is a picture, a metaphor, of an ontological idea. This, as theory almost always does, puts architecture's use of OOO squarely in re- lationship with the human perception and interpretation of architecture, and thus in a correlational frame. Yet we still have no guide to why these particular meta- phors would be a good thing.50 Why reveal withdrawal? To answer this question would require us to give an account (like Heidegger does) of why a human understanding of architec- tural withdrawal is important, which again sets this account 115 Log K</page><page sequence="10">51. Harman, Bells and Whistles , 216. 52. Ibid., 217. of OOO-based architectural theory within a correlationist paradigm. In the end, the appeal to metaphor strikes me as an engagement with philosophy no different from many of the recent past, producing architectural images of specific philo- sophical ideas as a means of relief or escape from the burden of justification with which the discipline and profession have been saddled. Some OOO proposals (I think here of Ian Bogosťs Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing) seem to conflate the appreciation of the ontological autonomy of objects with the epistemological and phenomenological question of access, as if simply asserting that a human is just one among other objects (and that we can apply phenomenological methodol- ogy to these other objects) solves the philosophical problems of access that generate correlationism in the first place. This move, much like Harman's, does not actually respond to the correlational circle, other than simply asserting the ability to think other beings disconnected from our thought. It is not that Bogosťs methodology of ontography , which seeks to un- derstand units, is not useful. In fact, architects should find much to be guided by and to agree with in Bogosťs claims about the importance of making things and thinking through actual objects (an advantage that he has over many other OOO participants who seem to just talk about things). His points about the carpentry of objects and the wonder and awe that can be found when the everyday is made alien are fun- damental to design education and practice. However, these points have very little to do with overcoming correlationism, and we certainly do not need OOO to understand them as vir- tues of architectural pedagogy or production. Harman' s additional suggestion that counterfactual ar- chitectural proposals are an important aspect of the discipline and of architectural education is right on target. It is undeni- ably true that, as he says, "if architecture represses all sense of what is disturbing, strange, or in excess of current knowledge and social practice, it will pay the same price as any field that screens out the unknown."51 However, again, I see no reason to assume that OOO, and architectural metaphors for it, is the right tool for "integrating the unknown and the counterfac- tual into our picture of reality."52 The possibilities for counter- factual thought are present within the architectural practice and tradition itself (as well as in countless other philosophies). In the end, we can say that a lot of the insights that OOO has produced have long been known by architectural practitioners and educators and operational in the studio 116 Log 11</page><page sequence="11">53. Levi Bryant, Onto- Cartography: An Ontology of Machines and Media (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2014). His critique of our forgetting the importance of materiality (which he describes clearly in the vein of Fernand Braudel) does perhaps apply to "theory" as it was defined by a select few in architec- ture in the 1980s and '90s, but the seduction of the purely discursive has always been limited in the architectural discipline and this fad in theory is certainly passing. 54. In architectural theory, we can see an example of this conflation in David Ruy, "Returning to (Strange) Objects," TARP Architecture Manual: Not Nature (Spring 2012): 38-42. See in particular Antoine Picon's responses in "A Strange Reconciliation: A Conversation about Architecture and Science with Peter Galison and Antoine Picon," moderated by David Theodore, TARP Architecture Manual: Not Nature (Spring 2012): 10-15. 55. Harman, Bells and Whistles , 199. 56. Meillassoux uses the term postcritical to mean correlationist philosophy after Kant. In architecture, the term is associated with the critique of the critical project and thus is closer to what speculative realism sees as its goal. See William S. Saunders, ed., The Nem Architectural Pragmatism: A Harvard Design Magazine Reader , vol. 5 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007). environment: that one must learn to see the world differ- ently, that making is thinking, that objects that are neither overmined nor undermined matter, and that the everyday is strange. And further, observations in the vein of Levi Bryant in the first pages of his recent book Onto- Cartography: An Ontology of Machines and Media , about the need for material- ism to really account for the actual material systems of the world, are also something that most theorists and histori- ans of the built environment have never forgotten (it should come as no surprise that Sim City 4 is what led Bryant out of the "dogmatic slumbers" of discourse into thinking about actual material).5* Architects have always known that there is no simple division between the plane of the cultural and the plane of the real, regardless of whether they named their view a "flat ontology" or not. So far, then, OOO has merely made some very general- ized and exceedingly obvious claims about architecture while unnecessarily tying these claims to a specific ontology. The conflation of the call to think about objects more carefully and give them more potency in our understanding of the world with the project of overcoming correlationism is simply not helpful for architectural discourse.54 If anything, Harman's discourse can work only to simplify our discipline precisely because his fourfold model reduces all objects to having the same absolute ontological conditions. Because Harman's OOO treats all objects as having the same type of being, it does not and cannot allow the medium of architecture any specificity. Postcritical Theory and Nihilism Harman has suggested that it is easier to export OOO to other fields than Meillassoux^ version of speculative realism.55 But exportability is precisely the problem with OOO, just as it was the danger with Derrida and Deleuze. When formal and spatial metaphors come easily, when architecture is an illustrator of concepts, the connection between philosophy and architecture risks becoming simpleminded. This, then, is where the work of Meillassoux can actually offer us something different, simul- taneously making the procedure from ontology to architecture more difficult and drawing out more pointedly what specula- tive realism would actually demand of architectural theory. Specifically, Meillassoux^ speculative materialism, as a cri- tique of critical philosophy, can point toward what the "post- critical" in architectural theory would actually look like.56 Meillassoux^ affirmation of the radical contingency of all that exists leads to a hands-off policy for speculative 117 Log 3$</page><page sequence="12">57. Meillassoux, "Iteration," 12. 58. Ibid. Meillassoux's italics. This view, Meillassoux admits, can be seen as a reversal of the position he expounds in After Finitude. 59. R.E. Somol and Sarah Whiting, "Notes around the Doppler Effect and Other Moods of Modernism," Peripecia Mining Autonomy (2002): 72-77. philosophy in relationship to what is. By restricting all specu- lation to the absolute and maintaining that "nothing that ex- ists is necessary," Meillassoux can say that "speculation should not speak of [what exists] at all."57 Speculative materialism frees engagement with what is from any metaphysical inter- ference because all that exists is contingent and thus not tied to the domain of the absolute in any way. This suggests that thinking about the specifics of architectural objects or prac- tice requires us to say nothing about ontological absolutes. By Meillassoux^ account, "Speculation assures all other disci- plines of thought that they alone have the right to describe and to explain (in a non-necessarist form) the world in which we live. If you want to know or to think what is, you must necessar- ily (from my point of view) do so by way of a certain regime of experience: scientific experimentation (the sciences of na- ture), historical and sociological experience, but also literary and artistic experience, etc."58 This seems to be precisely what postcritical architectural theory was looking for in its most radical form - a completely contingent practice in which the exploration of the medium itself is entirely immanent and empirical (said broadly, as opposed to transcendental or tran- scendent). The postcritical, then, should have nothing to do with the advocation of a "cool" architectural appearance of easiness (or even thoughtlessness) or of acquiescence to late capitalism, but rather, it is fundamentally thought without absolutes.59 Thus, following Meillassoux, we can still speak of architecture in the multitude of specific ways that history and theory have found useful (and indeed necessary), but without the pressure of transcendentalizing the medium itself - with- out the pressure to define some sort of absolute autonomous architectural essence or Real. Indeed, this also frees design to endless counterfactual speculation, since what exists always has the possibility of being otherwise. However, what we must not miss in this newfound freedom is the nihilism in which Meillassoux^ speculative materialism ultimately situates practices and regimes of expe- rience. The disavowal of the connection of the absolute with architecture means that architecture ultimately comes from nothing and is for nothing - just like the life of the architect. Thus, at the very least, Meillassoux^ speculative material- ism offers a helpful corrective to the largely unquestioned combination of neopositivistic scientism (from sustainability to parametrics) with the assumption that we can also retain traditional humanistic value. What Meillassoux^ position does (which Harman's OOO cannot) is sacrifice architectural 118 Log V</page><page sequence="13">60.

Ethical Coda: A Promissory Note Meillassoux suggests that his ontology leads to an ethics based in a messianic (yet atheistic) hope that injustice and death may be overcome - a hope that this world may be trans- formed at any moment.60 The nihilism of necessary contin- gency should lead not to despairing resignation (nor a return to religious otherworldliness), but to an "immanent inscrip- tion of the values" of justice and immortality into being - an understanding of them as real possibilities for which we can hope.61 Architecture then is to symbolize, to mark, what this world is not but what we hope it to be. However, I cannot help but see Meillassoux's universalized hopeful overcoming as leading always to disappointment when justice and immor- tality do not arrive, dragging us back to a meaninglessness, purposelessness, and senselessness that are so deeply char- acteristic of a world that is from nothing and for nothing. I also cannot help but see this as an ethics with limited use in the situation of actual practices. What should instead be de- manded of particular practices by absolute contingency is an ethics that refuses to overcome nihilism - a hope not for an entirely transformed world but, following Simon Critchley's reading of Adorno and Heidegger, for "the slightest difference between things as they are and things as they might other- wise be."62 This would be an ethics of finitude, an ethics that seeks to find "very little . . . almost nothing" in what is.6* It would be an ethics founded on both a desire and concern for the contingencies that constitute a practice as it is, and a hope that the practice can change for the better.64 However, this would also be an ethics founded in constant disappointment when things do not change enough. Rather than hoping for the nonexistent architectural absolute to guide us through nihilism, we must become resolutely disappointed in the fact that architecture has not redeemed us, while still believing in the transformative potential of the particular and unique contingencies that constitute the practice of architecture. Architecture is almost, but never quite, nothing. 119</page></plain_text>
