Box 7311, Richmond, Va. 23221-0311. Two centuries ago, on Dec. 15, 1791, Vir- ginia became the 11th and final state to ratify the Bill of Rights. Today, Virginia's George Mason (1725-92), the principal au- thor of the state's famous Declaration of Rights and its Constitution of 1776, is hailed as one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights. As a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he objected to the ab- sence of such a guarantee, and refused to sign the Constitution. Virginia and other states ratified the Constitution only on the understanding that the new Congress would soon correct the defect. In fact, says Tarter, an editor of the Virginia State Li- brary and Archives' Dictionary of Virginia Biography, that flaw was not the only, or even the main, objection this leading Anti- federalist had to the Constitution. On August 31, 1787, almost two full weeks before Mason made his only re- corded suggestion that the federal conven- tion add a bill of rights to the document, he declared (as fellow Virginian James Madison reported) that "he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to the constitution as it now stands." Mason, like others of his generation, cherished balance in government as a bul- wark against tyranny. The federal Constitu- tion broadly resembled the one he had helped write for Virginia; it had separate executive, legislative, and judicial depart- ments, and built-in checks and balances. But it still fell short of his standards. "The Senate was made more powerful than he wished," Tarter says. "The executive de- partment was made more powerful, too. The judiciary was imprecisely defined with a potentially large (and therefore poten- tially dangerous) jurisdiction. The treaty- making and appointive provisions also up- Virginia's George Mason was a critic of slavery as well as of the Constitution. WQ AUTUMN 1991 9</page><page sequence="2">PERIODICALS set the separation of powers and reduced the potency of the House of Represen- tatives." This all undermined, in Mason's eyes, the rationale of the Virginia Plan that had been presented to the convention. That plan had called for a strengthened government, but the popularly elected lower house of the legislature was to be dominant. Mason was "well read, intelligent, [and] discerning," Tarter says, but he also was "very much a loner [and] temperamen- tally unsuited to the hurly-burly and com- promises of the political arena." After he did not get his way in Philadelphia, "he took his quill and went home, angrily kick- ing up dust as he went Mason's disap- pointment was bitter, and because of the rigidity of his views and the belligerence of his personality, it had staying power." Even after Madison introduced the Bill of Rights in the new U.S. House of Repre- sentatives in July 1789, Mason was not ap- peased. He called Madison's action a "Farce," and said, "Perhaps some Milk &amp; Water Propositions may be made by Con- gress to the State Legislatures . . . but of important &amp; substantial Amendments, I have not the least Hope." This father of the Bill of Rights went to his grave three years later without ever having given the Con- stitution his blessing. Voting Booth Blues "Voter Turnout" by Raymond E. Wolfinger and "Electoral Par- ticipation: Summing Up a Decade" by Carole Jean Uhlaner, in Society (July-Aug. 1991), Rutgers- The State University, New Brunswick, N.J. 08903. When Americans go to the polls in 1992, the nation's political pulse-takers are sure to search voter-turnout data for clues to the health of the body politic. And chances are they will again warn that Americans have alarming cases of political apathy and cynicism. Turnout in presidential contests has been falling for decades, dropping from 62.8 percent in 1960 to 50.15 percent in 1988. But Wolfinger, a political scientist at Berkeley, dismisses such diagnoses as quackery. Opinion polls show that Ameri- can voters, though supposedly alienated, are among the most optimistic in the world about their own "political efficacy." Eighty-five percent express pride in their political system. In Italy, meanwhile, voter turnout is an impressive 94 percent, yet only three percent of Italians profess en- thusiasm for government Italian-style. Part of the confusion about the meaning of voter turnout, Wolfinger explains, is caused by the fact that the U.S. statistic is computed differently - as the proportion of the total adult population that casts bal- lots. Calculated instead as a proportion of only those registered to vote, as it is in Eu- rope, the percentage improves to a re- spectable 84 to 87 percent. This country's real problem, Wolfinger says, is that only two-thirds of Americans are registered. This disappointing figure results largely from the fact that the bur- den of registration is left on the individual voter - a burden compounded by the fact that Americans are frequent movers. (In 1980, one-third of all American voters had not lived at the same address for two years.) In Europe, by contrast, registration is usually automatic. In England, canvass- ers even go door-to-door to compile the electoral register. Make registration auto- matic here, Wolfinger suggests, and all the chatter about apathy and a voter turnout "crisis" will cease. Uhlaner, who teaches at the University of California at Irvine, is not so optimistic. She points out that the decline in political participation during the 1980s was un- even. Among the poorest 16 percent of Americans, for example, turnout fell from 46 to 40 percent between 1980 and '88, but among the wealthiest five percent it rose from 69 to 77 percent. Among blacks, turnout fell from 50 to 39 percent. Why? Uhlaner believes that the poor and disad- vantaged were excluded from the nation's political dialogue during the 1980s. They had nothing (and nobody) to vote for. WQ AUTUMN 1991 10</page><page sequence="3">PERIODICALS But this argument is partly contradicted by Uhlaner's own report of a dramatic in- crease in registration (from 39 to 59 per- cent) and voter turnout (from 28 to 59 per- cent) among Mexican-Americans. Uhlaner credits aggressive registration drives. By these measures, Mexican-Americans now participate in politics more actively than blacks do. More than ever, blacks seem a constituency in search of a party. K.CCUVÏ2 ScCTCtS T^e ^^ to Know" by Peter Montgomery and Peter Overby, ^ £&gt; in Common Cause Magazine (July-Aug. 1991), 2030 M St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson and strengthened after the Water- gate scandal, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) turned 25 this summer. In re- cent years, however, contend Montgom- ery, associate editor of Common Cause Magazine, and Overby, a staff writer, the executive branch and federal courts have expanded the law's exemptions and given "the bureaucratic impulse for secre- cy ... freer rein." In 1987, for example, the Reagan admin- istration asked Congress to exempt the Na- tional Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion (NASA) from the law, claiming that Japanese scientists were using it to obtain valuable information about U.S. space shuttle technology. That simply was not true, the authors say, and a NASA official later admitted as much. The administra- tion "concocted the story," they assert, to keep the public from learning about deci- sions that led to the 1986 ChallengeY explo- sion. Requests made under FOIA later helped "demolish NASA's deceptions." The FOIA exempts certain kinds of in- formation from public scrutiny, including national-security and law-enforcement se- crets, sensitive financial and business data, information protected by individuals' pri- vacy rights, and some internal government documents. The Reagan administration extended the cloak of "national security" to cover information on trade and virtually all aspects of international activity, Mont- gomery and Overby say. A 1982 executive order told officials to classify documents whenever in doubt. The courts have not been much help. A federal court, for exam- ple, ruled FBI criminal history records "categorically" exempt. Surprisingly, most FOIA requests do not come from journalists. They accounted for only six percent of the 40,500 requests at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year. Most of the rest, the authors note, came from FDA-regulated firms seeking "to untangle the sometimes Byzantine reg- ulatory process - and to dig up informa- tion ... on their competitors." In an effort to find out how well the law is working, Common Cause Magazine last spring filed FOIA requests with 21 federal agencies, asking for recent logs of FOIA requests and the agency responses. The full answer is still a mystery: Only four of the agencies met the statutory 10-day dead- line for replying, and two months after the requests were filed, seven agencies still had not responded. -^JCIREIGN- POLICY &amp; DEFENSE America First? "What is the National Interest?" by Alan Tonelson, in The Atlan- tic (July 1991), 745 Boylston St., Boston, Mass. 02116. America's victories in the Cold War and the Persian Gulf War - and its internation- alist foreign policy in general - are largely irrelevant to the lives of most Americans, asserts Tonelson, research director of the Economic Strategy Institute. Far from go- WQ AUTUMN 1991 11</page><page sequence="4">PERIODICALS ing off now in search of President George Bush's New World Order, he argues, the United States should abandon internation- alism and start thinking in terms of "purely national interests." U.S. foreign policy since World War II, in Tonelson's view, has had the Utopian purpose of transforming the world "into a place where the forces that drive nations to clash in the first place no longer exist." Internationalism, he says, has encouraged Americans "to think more about the possi- ble world of tomorrow than about the real world of today." All questions of the risks and costs of foreign entanglements have been avoided, he claims, and the nation's economic and social problems have been badly neglected. Under the policy that he champions, the United States would seek to secure and protect its "truly vital" interests, such as physical survival and the maintenance of its democratic institutions. But all other major foreign-policy objectives would be subjected to the test of whether the bene- fits outweighed the costs and risks. Thus, "the lack of democracy, development, and social justice in Central America - how- ever unfortunate for people who have to live there - has never appreciably affected U.S. fortunes." The United States should no longer try to reform these countries, Tonelson argues. Its sole interest is to keep hostile foreign powers out, and it should do this with force, if necessary. U.S. foreign policy, Tonelson says, should not be "a vehicle for spreading American values, for building national character, for expressing any individual's or group's emotional, philosophical, or po- litical preferences, or for carrying out any . . . overseas missions that, however appealing, bear only marginally on pro- tecting and enriching the nation." Such marginal missions include: "promoting peace, stability, democracy, and develop- ment around die world; protecting human rights; establishing international law; building collective security; exercising something called leadership; creating a new world order; [and] competing glob- ally with the Soviets (or whomever) for power and influence." America's security, he says, should be "decoupled" from that of its allies, and "the automatic nuclear risks built into the alliances" should be eliminated. All U.S. nuclear forces in Europe, and most con- ventional forces, should be unilaterally withdrawn. "Strategic and economic dis- engagement from the Third World, which has already begun, should be allowed to continue unimpeded." All this does not add up to isolationism, Tonelson insists. Foreign intervention would not be ruled out on principle. "[The] only rule of thumb would be 'what- ever works' to preserve or enhance Ameri- ca's security and prosperity and - pro- vided that Americans are willing to pay the bills - what the country collectively wishes to define as its psychological well-being." JFK's Missiles "Nuisance of Decision: Jupiter Missiles and the Cuban Missile Crisis" by Philip Nash, in The Journal of Strategic Studies (Mar. 1991), Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd., Gainsborough House, Gainsbor- ough Road, London Ell 1RS, England. When President John F. Kennedy in Octo- ber 1962 made the stunning announce- ment that the Soviet Union was placing nuclear missiles in Cuba, he left out one uncomfortable fact: The United States had nuclear missiles in Turkey, close to the So- viet Union. Others soon pointed out the parallel, and it complicated U.S. efforts to resolve the crisis. Standard histories have it that a blameless Kennedy had ordered the obsolete Jupiter missiles removed from Turkey months before, only to dis- cover during the crisis that the federal bu- reaucracy had not carried out his order. But Nash, an Ohio University historian, says that there is no hard evidence that Kennedy had explicitly ordered the Jupi- ters removed. Kennedy indeed had been concerned about the missiles in Turkey, and with WQ AUTUMN 1991 12</page><page sequence="5">PERIODICALS good reason, the historian notes: "They were . . . provocative, vulnerable, and practically useless." The original decision to deploy the missiles had been made in 1957, after the launching of the Soviet Sputnik aroused Europe's fears about the depth of U.S. commitment to its defense. But the Jupiters were not actually de- ployed until after Kennedy took office in 1961. While he was inclined to cancel de- ployment, his advisers feared that after the tense June summit meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna such a move might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Also, Ankara strongly op- posed cancellation. "[T]here is no reason to doubt that deployment went ahead with Kennedy's approval," Nash says. On Aug. 23, 1962, after the Soviet mili- tary build-up in Cuba had begun, but be- fore the Soviet missiles were discovered there, Kennedy's national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, asked the Defense De- partment what could be done about get- ting the Jupiters out. Contrary to some claims, this was not an "order" to remove the missiles, Nash says. Kennedy's subordi- nates all along seem to have understood "that they were being instructed to consult the Turks regarding removal, and not be- ing ordered to remove the missiles." During the Cuban missile crisis, Ken- nedy and his advisers "consistently strained" in public to dismiss the analogy between the Jupiters and the Soviet mis- siles in Cuba. In the end, the Soviets with- drew their missiles after receiving secret assurances that the Jupiters would be re- moved within five months. The last Jupiter in Turkey was dismantled in April 1963; the official story, that there had been no trade, lasted much longer. ECONOMICS, LABOR &amp; BUSINESS The Global Job Market "Global Work Force 2000: The New World Labor Market" by William B. Johnston, in Harvard Business Review (Mar.-Apr. 1991), Boston, Mass. 02163. Labor has long been considered the least mobile factor in production. But thanks to a global mismatch between labor supply and demand, the movement of workers across national borders is going to acceler- ate dramatically in the future. So predicts Johnston, a Senior Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute and author of the widely cited 1987 report, Workforce 2000. While the focus of attention in the United States and other industrialized na- tions has been on looming labor shortages, the world's work force has been growing rapidly. Between 1985 and the year 2000, Johnston says, an increase of 600 million workers is projected, with 95 percent of them in the developing countries. In Paki- stan and Mexico, for example, the work force is expected to grow by about three percent a year, while in the United States and Canada the rate will be closer to one percent. In Japan, growth will be only 0.5 percent, and in Germany the work force will actually shrink. Although the industrialized nations still educate higher proportions of their youths, the developing countries have been pro- ducing a fast-increasing share of the world's high-school and college graduates. Their share of college students, for exam- ple, jumped from 23 percent in 1970 to 49 percent in 1985 and is expected to reach 60 percent by the year 2000. During the 1990s, Johnston says, "work- ers who have acquired skills in school will be extremely valuable in the world labor markets. And if job opportunities are lack- ing in their native lands, better jobs will probably be only a plane ride away." "Although most governments in indus- trial nations will resist these movements of people for social and political reasons/' Johnston says, "employers in the devel- oped world are likely to find ways around WQ AUTUMN 1991 13</page><page sequence="6">PERIODICALS government barriers." Even unskilled jobs "may become more internationalized in the 1990s," he says. During the 1970s and '80s, large numbers of relatively low- skilled workers immigrated - Turks to West Germany, Algerians to France, Mexi- cans to the United States - to take jobs na- tives did not want. Among the industri- alized nations, only Japan, with "its commitment to preserving its racial ho- mogeneity," is likely to reject increased immigration. Spreading The Wealth "American Family Fortunes as Economic Deadweight" by Sid- ney L. Carroll, in Challenge (May-June 1991), 80 Business Park Dr., Armonk, N.Y. 10504. A mere one percent of all Americans own nearly one-third of the nation's wealth - $3.7 trillion in 1986. Roughly one-half of their considerable fortunes were inherited. And much of that inherited wealth is not put to imaginative use. On the contrary, asserts Carroll, an economist at the Uni- versity of Tennessee, Knoxville, massive inherited fortunes are typically locked away in estate trusts, which are cautiously managed in accordance with the wishes of the dead by banks, attorneys, financial ad- Some heirs to great wealth are unable to free themselves from their ''welfare" dependency. visers, and accountants. That, Carroll believes, is good neither for the U.S. economy nor even for many of the heirs, who remain dependent. A change in the tax system, he says, could fix the problem. Under existing laws, enacted in 1912, wealth is subject to an estate tax. When an individual dies, the estate's worth in excess of $600,000 is subject to taxation and the wealth is then transferred. This allows the rich to pass on large fortunes relatively in- tact. Carroll proposes substituting a new tax on individual inheritors. The first $1 million received would be tax-free. But be- quests above that would be taxed on a slid- ing scale, with everything over $4 million completely taxed away. The rich therefore would tend to spread their assets around - in fact, an estate of any size could be distributed entirely tax-free, so long as no single bequest was too large. Wealth could be spread among many heirs. And control of the assets would pass "not to a trust, not to a bank, but to a per- son." Many of the heirs would be young and more inclined than their elders to be "creative risk-takers." Not all the funds would be put to good use, of course, but the overall effect, Carroll maintains, would greatly benefit the economy - and the in- heritors themselves. Taps For Bureaucracy? "Can Business Beat Bureaucracy?" by Charles Heckscher, in The American Prospect (Spring 1991), P.O. Box 7645, Prince- ton, N.J. 08543-7645. Pop social critics love to decry the soul- deadening effects of working for large, bu- reaucratic organizations. Now, notes Heckscher, a Harvard Business School professor, even some buttoned-down cor- porate CEOs have joined in. WQ AUTUMN 1991 14</page><page sequence="7">PERIODICALS Large firms have been encouraging "in- volvement" of blue-collar workers that goes beyond the popular Quality of Work life programs of the 1980s, which brought workers together in quality circles to talk about their work and recommend im- provements. Now, a few companies are setting up "autonomous teams" of work- ers that control scheduling, discipline, and other managerial functions. Equally sig- nificant changes have been taking place in the work of middle managers, Heckscher says. In "the golden age of bureaucracy," when groups were deemed ill-suited to die making of decisions, committees and task forces were relatively rare; now, such team-oriented groups are common. The shift away from hierarchy is not just a fad, Heckscher believes. "Bureaucracy is ill-suited to the demands of advanced mar- kets for innovation and quality," he as- serts. But its demise is hardly assured. He outlines four alternative models for the fu- ture corporation: • Purified Bureaucracy. "In the old-line companies - the General Motors, the AT&amp;Ts, the Dow Chemicals- leaders fre- quently talk of 'empowerment' and 'auton- omy.' . . . [They want to return] to individ- uals the 'power' to perform the roles that have been established for them, allowing them to use their knowledge to carry out the tasks defined by their superiors. This [is] a return to true bureaucracy." • Community with Shared Values. Xe- rox tried to create "a culture of quality" during the 1980s with a massive education campaign. (A 92-page book on developing corporate quality was put out and dis- cussed throughout the firm.) Other cor- porations, such as IBM, have long empha- sized the importance of shared values. These firms show concern for their em- ployees' welfare, and employees respond with a voluntary commitment to the good of the whole corporate community. But this kind of paternalism - in which hierar- chy remains important - has its draw- backs, Heckscher says. An "excessive in- wardness" may develop, with the result that qualified outsiders are kept out and insiders become too cautious and rigid. • Free-Market Corporation. "Pay for indi- vidual performance, the promotion of in- ternal competition, [and] the conversion of departments into profit centers ... are all examples of this movement" to make the corporation itself a market. General Electric's Jack Welch, a fervent apostle, declared loyalty no virtue in his company. But, as many investment-banking and high-tech firms have found out, a compa- ny's rejection of loyalty encourages tal- ented employees to jump not only to other posts within the firm but to other firms. • Cooperative Association. The corpora- tion stresses "teamwork" and the use of task forces and committees, with decisions at all levels made by consensus. One me- dium-sized manufacturing firm Heckscher studied uses teams for virtually all deci- sions. The "human benefits of such an ap- proach are obvious," but Heckscher con- cedes, it still "does not work very well on a large scale." "In the modern economy," he con- cludes, "bureaucracy no longer enjoys a massive advantage . . . over more open and participatory alternatives." Nevertheless, he admits, "bureaucracy is not yet dead." SOCIETY How To Get More Justice "Improving Our Criminal Justice System" by Charles Maech- ling, Jr., in The Brookings Review (Summer 1991), 1775 Mass. Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. "The American criminal justice system is breaking down," claims Charles Maech- ling, Jr., an international lawyer. He points to clogged prisons and court calendars, and to the fact that it can take years to put a rapist behind bars or to execute a mur- WQ AUTUMN 1991 15</page><page sequence="8">PERIODICALS derer. Much of what's wrong, he says, is rooted in the courts' adversarial nature, which necessitates "a bristling array of constitutional safeguards and procedural rules" to protect the accused. Maechling argues for radical reform: taking a leaf from the so-called inquisitorial criminal- justice process used everywhere in Europe except Great Britain and Ireland. The European approach relies on "ob- jective methods of inquiry rather than . . . pit-bull confrontations," says Maechling, who, as a visiting Fellow at Wolfson College, Cambridge University, in 1985-87, led a study of the subject. After police make an initial investigation of a fel- ony case, an examining magistrate con- ducts a detailed inquiry, questioning wit- nesses, scrutinizing physical evidence, and weighing information from other sources. All relevant information about the case and people involved goes into the record. Only after the magistrate has built up a co- herent case, and resolved any ambiguities or uncertainties, does he decide whether to bring a suspect to trial. If the case reaches a courtroom, the prima facie case against the accused is strong. But the defendant has the opportu- nity to prove his innocence or, more likely, show extenuating circumstances. He has the right to counsel and can refuse King speaks during Montgomery bus boycott. The Transformation of Martin Luther King, Jr. Acknowledging the seriousness of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s recently revealed plagia- rism in his doctoral dissertation at Boston University, King biographer David J. Garrow offers in the Journal of American History (June 1991) this interpretation: [It] forces us to address a central question: Was the [Martin Luther King, JrJ of Crozer [Theological Seminary] and [Boston Univer- sity] actually a rather immature and insecure young man? Was he a talented young preacher with no particular aptitude for scholarly creativity, a man who was some- what out of his element as a student yet who quickly began to mature and grow into him- self once he put graduate school . . . firmly be- hind him after returning south to pastor Montgomery's Dexter Avenue Baptist Church? The project findings should cause us to think again about how fundamentally trans- forming an experi- ence the early lead- ership of the [1956] Montgomery bus boy- cott was for King, and whether the Martin Luther King who was molded and reshaped by those early months of the Montgomery strug- gle was, in some very significant ways, a dis- tinctively different young man from the one who had pieced together **A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wiemantfin the winter of 1954-1955 .... Perhaps even more than has previously been appreciated, King* s acquisition of that fundamental sense of mission, calling, and obligation that came to him in Montgomery transformed him into someone whose newly enriched self-understanding gave to his fu- ture life an integrity, a dedication, and a sense of purpose reaching well beyond him- self that simply had not been present in his life, and in his academic studies, up until that time. We need to ponder whether acquiring such a sense of mis- sion can funda- mentally transform a person's life and whether the tough- minded integrity, and the courage, that [King] demonstrated so repeatedly and so often in the years af- ter 1956 was not something he brought to the black freedom struggle, but rather something he gained from . . . it.

The defense counsel may cross- examine witnesses and make legal arguments, but "cannot disrupt the pro- ceedings with delaying tactics and frivo- lous objections on points of procedure." Drawing on the European approach, Maechling recommends reversing the Su- preme Court rulings that make evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amend- ment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures inadmissible in court. He would also eliminate the rule against admission of hearsay evidence, which is just "the kind of information gov- ernments and ordinary people use daily to make decisions." Furthermore, he says, all witnesses in a criminal trial should be wit- nesses for the court, rather than for the de- fense or prosecution, and "chosen and screened for competence and objectivity." And most of the questioning should be done by the judge, with the lawyers only afterward allowed to make a limited cross- examination. Finally, Maechling says, appeals in crim- inal cases on minor procedural or tech- nical grounds should not be allowed. Ap- peals instead should be limited, as in England, to a review of the whole record of the case, except where there is "some gross irregularity at the trial" or new evi- dence. Nothing in the Constitution forbids doing this, he says, and the U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision last April, "has already gone part of the way," by limiting capital- punishment appeals. Blacks Who Made It "The Great Sharecropper Success Story" by David Whitman, in The Public Interest (Summer 1991), 1112 16th St. N.W., Ste. 530, Washington, D.C. 20036. In his best-selling book, The Promised Land (1991), Nicholas Lemann contends that today's urban black underclass and many of its well-known ills have some de- cades-old roots in black sharecropper soci- ety in the rural South. That society, Lemann writes, was "the national center" of illegitimate births and female-headed families; it had a very high rate of violent crime; and it had special problems with sexually transmitted diseases and sub- stance abuse. Five million southern blacks migrated to the urban North between 1940 and 70, he says, and they brought this dis- mal heritage with them. Lemann's sharecropper thesis is not really new, says Whitman, a senior editor at U.S. News &amp; World Report. It was in vogue during the 1950s and latter half of the '60s. Fortune, for instance, published a lengthy story then on the "Southern Roots of Urban Crisis." By the early 1970s, how- ever, the thesis had been discredited by Census Bureau and other studies indicat- ing that the migrants were relatively suc- cessful in the urban North. About a dozen major studies completed between 1965 and 75 found that after a short period of adjustment, the black men from the South typically flourished in their new environ- ment. The blacks who ended up poor, on welfare, or in broken families in northern cities, the studies repeatedly showed, "tend[ed] to be natives of the region, not southern migrants." Given their background, what accounts for the sharecroppers' success? Whitman says that they had some important virtues, particularly "a strong work ethic" and "lit- tle familiarity with welfare." And contrary to Lemann's claim about sharecropper so- ciety being the national center of illegiti- macy, Whitman says, "black women in the rural South were more likely to be married than were urban black women living in the South or North from at least 1910 to 1960." In 1940, for example, 73 percent of black women in the rural South lived in intact families, compared with only 58 per- cent in the North. "[By] concentrating so heavily on the urban woes of displaced tenant farmers," Whitman writes, "Lemann diminishes the migrant success story that lies at the core WQ AUTUMN 1991 17</page><page sequence="10">PERIODICALS Health Care Conundrums A Survey of Recent Articles All the attending doctors agree that the pa- tient is in serious condition and badly in need of treatment. As of yet, however, they have been unable to agree on just what it should be; certainly, past therapies have not worked. And so the patient - the U.S. health- care system itself-just keeps getting sicker. The cost of health care, which more than doubled between 1980 and '90- from $1,016 per capita to $2,425 - continues to soar. The number of Americans under 65 without any medical insurance at all stands at 37 million. The two problems, notes the Brookings Institution's Henry J. Aaron in the Brookings Review (Summer 1991), are related, and any effort to solve just one is likely to aggravate the other. "Extending in- surance and assuring adequate coverage would push up already onerous costs. Con- trolling costs would lead to measures that curtailed insurance and thereby added to the ranks of the uninsured." The best solution, according to many lib- erals, is national health insurance on the Ca- nadian model. While this would mean hun- dreds of billions of dollars of new government spending, Senator Robert Kerrey (D.-Neb.) argues in the American Prospect (Summer 1991), that expense "would simply replace what most businesses and individuals already spend for health care." Eventually, he says, universal health insurance would be cheaper. "The current system's hidden costs of massive adminis- trative waste, uncompensated care, and cost-shifting would shrink or disappear." On close scrutiny, however, such claims - and national health insurance - lose their appeal, writes Harvard Business School Professor Regina E. Herzlinger in the Atlantic (Aug. 1991). "The absurdity of casting the federal government as an effi- ciency expert- or 50 state governments, as many proponents advocate, in an analogy to the Canadian system of administration by province - is illustrated by this question: If the cost of health care can be controlled through centralized purchasing of a stand- ard product, why not lower the costs of other necessities, such as food and housing, in the same way?" Canada's system is not without problems: High-tech medical equip- ment, such as CAT scanners and radiation- therapy units, is in short supply, and there is some grumbling about long waits for certain services, including potentially life-saving heart surgery. In one notorious case, re- ported by the Canadian newsweekly Maclean's (Feb. 13, 1989), a 63-year-old man's vitally needed coronary-bypass opera- tion was postponed 1 1 times before it was finally performed in a Toronto hospital; the man died eight days later. "I don't believe there's any miracle up there," Tufts Medical School Professor William B. Schwartz told Patrick G. Marshall of Congressional Quar- terly's Editorial Research Reports (Nov. 23, 1990).

Learning From The Army "How Do They Do It?" by Charles Moskos, in The New Republic (Aug. 5, 1991), 1220 19th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. The U.S. Army is not a racial Utopia, but it has made great progress in race relations since the 1970s. In Operation Desert Storm, not a single racial incident oc- curred that was severe enough to come to the attention of the military police. Moskos, a Northwestern University sociol- ogist, contends that the Army has much to teach civilian society. First of all, he says, the Army simply WQ AUTUMN 1991 18</page><page sequence="11">PERIODICALS ation, told Marshall, Americans "get mad [just] waiting in line at the grocery store, let alone for health care." Even many liberals who would prefer a Canada-style system do not think it is politi- cally practical in America today because of the whopping tax increase it would entail and the strong opposition to it from the in- surance industry, the medical profession, and business. But Ronald Pollack and Phyl- lis Torda, of Families USA, a Washington- based advocacy group, say in the American Prospect (Summer 1991) that a growing number of business leaders are ready to sup- port a so-called pay-or-piay approach, if it is accompanied by genuine cost controls. Un- der this approach, employers would be re- quired to provide health coverage or else pay into a public fund that would finance health benefits for all of the uninsured. Leg- islation along this line was enacted (but has yet to be implemented) in Massachusetts, and also has been proposed by a national commission. But neither plan does enough to limit costs, Pollack and Torda say. The lack of a mechanism for controlling costs is the "most crucial shortcoming" of mandatory employer-based insurance, ac- cording to Brookings analyst Aaron. He pro- poses overcoming it by setting up regional agencies under state governments that would negotiate prices and costs with hospi- tals and physicians, and enforce budget lim- its. But Aaron's proposal, New Republic (Aug. 19-26, 1991) contributing editor John B. Judis points out, would turn insurance companies into "useless, expensive appen- dages," and hence would "arouse [their] wrath" just as much as national health insur- ance would. What, then, is to be done? Michael Kinsley of the liberal New Republic (July 29, 1991) dusts off a two-year-old report from the con- servative Heritage Foundation. Surprisingly, he praises it as "the simplest, most promis- ing, and, in important ways, most progres- sive idea for health care reform." Heritage's proposal: Eliminate American workers' $48 billion tax exemption for em- ployer-provided health insurance, but offset it by offering a tax credit for insurance pur- chased directly by workers. The credit would be "refundable" for lower-income families (i.e. if a family's income tax liability was less than the credit, the family would get a check from the government), and Medic- aid would continue to be available for the jobless poor. All workers would be required by law to buy adequate insurance to cover major ("catastrophic") family medical bills. Obliged to purchase their own insurance, Heritage argued, Americans would become more sensitive to its cost - and more in- clined to avoid unnecessary or overpriced medical services. Ideally, the Heritage re- port said, consumers should buy routine medical care out-of-pocket and use health insurance only to cover "very expensive and unpredictable illnesses." This would make health insurance more like auto insurance, and, according to Heritage, considerably cut the cost of health-insurance policies. "If you're looking for universal health care protection and at least a shot at cost control, the Heritage plan looks pretty good," writes Kinsley. "If you're looking for an excuse to expand the government, look elsewhere." does not tolerate any display of racial prej- udice. Officers or noncommissioned offi- cers (NCOs) whose supervisors do not rate them as supportive of equal opportunity advance no further in their military ca- reers. Some officers and NCOs may harbor racist sentiments, but they almost never express them openly. The Army sent "a strong signal" in the late 1970s, by devot- ing 12-14 hours of basic training to courses in race relations, Moskos says. Al- though many white soldiers resented the courses, regarding them as exercises in "white guilt," studies showed that the courses "did make whites more attuned to black feelings." The Army also gives black soldiers who need it "an academic boost not often avail- able in civilian employment." Under a pro- gram begun in 1976, students, mainly black, go to school four hours every morn- ing, for two to six weeks of remedial edu- cation in reading, writing, or mathematics. Potential sergeants among them particu- larly benefit. Doing well in the program, Moskos says, "is definitely not seen as 'act- ing white.' It is considered a realistic in- vestment in one's future career." WQ AUTUMN 1991 19</page><page sequence="12">PERIODICALS In promotions, the Army uses "goals" but not "quotas." The stated aim is "to achieve a percentage of minori- ty ... selection not less than the selection rate for all officers being considered." Usu- ally the goals are met. But if they cannot be without violations of standards, "the chips fall where they may," Moskos writes. For example, the number of blacks pro- moted from captain to major is usually be- low the goal. This probably is due, he says, to the fact "that about half of all black offi- cers are products of historically black col- leges, where [many] do not acquire the writing and communication skills neces- sary for promotion to staff jobs." Promo- tions to colonel and above, however, show little racial disparity. % Unlike black civilian leaders, says Moskos, black officers and NCOs refuse to rely on racial politics and reject "the ideol- ogy of victimhood." They instead embrace a sort of "bootstrap conservatism." Young- er black officers are advised by their se- niors that while they will encounter "plenty of bumps on the road," as a black general put it, they must surmount them, for the benefit of those who follow. PRESS &amp; TELEVISION Naming the Victim "Media Goes Wilding in Palm Beach" by Katha Pollitt, in The Nation (June 24, 1991), 72 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10011. After Senator Edward M. Kennedy's nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was ac- cused of raping a Palm Beach woman last March, the news media's longstanding practice of preserving the anonymity of rape victims was broken by two major in- stitutions - first, NBC News, then the New York Times. "Who she is is material in this . . . ," claimed NBC News chief Mi- chael Gartner. "You try to give viewers as many facts as you can and let them make up their minds." Pollitt, a contributing editor of the Na- tion, dismisses such journalistic rationales as self-serving and invalid. "There is no good reason to publish the names of rape complainants without their consent, and many compelling reasons not to." It is not as if the Palm Beach woman's charge is being made anonymously, Pollitt points out. Her name is (or will be) known to all who need to know: Smith and his attorney, the judge, and the jury. If the case goes to trial, "she will have to appear publicly in court, confront the defendant, give testi- mony and be cross-exam- ined." But there is no need for her to be identified and "tried" in the news media too, Pollitt maintains. Nor do the media have any duty to "tell all" they know. The media frequently hold back information, Pollitt notes, on grounds of "taste" or the "national in- terest." In fact, says Pollitt, when it serves their own purposes, the news media favor anonymity, not only for their cherished sources but for some rape victims. Periodicals continues on page 123 The decision of New York Times editors to name the woman in the Palm Beach rape case drew criticism from other journalists. WQ AUTUMN 1991 20</page><page sequence="13">PERIODICALS Continued from page 20 The major news media, for instance, "went to extraordinary lengths" to shield from the public the identity of "the Central Park jogger," a young Wellesley graduate and Wall Street investment banker, who was brutally beaten and raped by a gang of youths in 1989. Gartner and others argued that naming rape victims will help to eventually re- move the social stigma against rape vic- tims. The contention, Pollitt observes, rests on a dubious assumption. "Why would society blame rape victims less if it knew who they were?" The issue of nam- ing the victim, she says, cannot be di- vorced from blaming the victim. The news media's coverage of the Palm Beach case, Pollitt says, underlines the fact that rape is treated differently from other crimes. "There is no other crime in which the character, behavior and past of the complainant are seen as central elements in determining whether a crime has oc- curred." No one, for instance, would tell an elderly lady cheated out of her life sav- ings by a con man that she had been "ask- ing for it." Why is rape different? "Because lots of people, too often including the ones in the jury box, think women really do want to be forced into sex, or by acting or dressing or drinking in a certain way, give up the right to say no " That being so, Pollitt says, privacy for women who claim to have been raped is justified. Instead of denying it to them, "we should take a good hard look at our national passion for thrusting unwanted publicity on people who are not accused of wrongdoing but find them- selves willy-nilly in the news." VOX POPUU? * &lt;The Power of Talk Radio" by James C. Roberts, in The Ameri- * * can Enterprise (May- June 1991), American Enterprise Inst, 1150 17th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Overshadowed first by television and then by the rise of stations on the FM band, AM radio once seemed well on the way to ob- solescence. Now, however, this stepchild of the airwaves has found a new formula that may be balm not only for its bottom line but for American democracy. That, at least, is the hope of Roberts, president of a Washington, D.C.-based ra- dio syndicate: "At a time when the public is reading less and is coming to rely on the 30-second sound bite for information, talk radio . . . provides a forum for in-depth dis- cussions of . . . public policy issues." There are about 10,000 radio stations in the country, reaching 80 percent of Ameri- cans at least once a day. Roughly 400-500 of the stations had a news/talk format in 1990, up from 300-400 a year earlier. To- day's national talk shows were made possi- ble by two key developments: Satellite technology of the late 1970s allowed pro- grams to be aired nationally; phone de- regulation a few years later fostered the cheap "800" number service that let listen- ers call in from far and wide. (About five percent of the shows' listening audience phones in.) Today, a big-name syndicated talk show, such as Rush Limbaugh's, which originates at WABC in New York, reaches four million people a day on 250 stations nationwide. With audiences has come influence. Jim Gearhart's show on WKXW Trenton, reaching half a million New Jerseyites a day, was instrumental in forcing a partial rollback of Governor James Florio's 1990 tax increases. That same year, talk-show hosts across the nation spearheaded a suc- cessful grass-roots protest against the pro- posed congressional pay raise. Joe Klein of New York magazine has dubbed the hosts the "political organizers of the '90s." A less sympathetic David Broder, of the Washing- ton Post, accuses them of "know-nothing demagogueiy." Attitudes such as that, say Roberts and other defenders of talk radio, show how distant the national news media are from common concerns - and help to explain talk radio's success. Talk-show hosts tend to be conservative or "populist." (Ralph Nader was a frequent talk-show guest dur- ing the congressional pay-raise campaign.) WQ AUTUMN 1991 123</page><page sequence="14">PERIODICALS Even Roberts parts company with enthusi- asts who believe that talk will eventually crowd music off the airwaves, creating a brave new world of informational radio. Yet, he maintains, "talk radio will provide an anchor for our rootless and mobile so- ciety and an invisible public forum for our far-flung democracy." RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY In Defense Of Sophistry "For and Against the 'New' Education" by Bernard Knox, in Humanities (July-Aug. 1991), National Endowment for the Hu- manities, 1100 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506. Plato (427-347 b.c.) gave the Sophists a bad name, and it has persisted to this day. The denigration was quite undeserved, ob- serves Knox, a classics professor emeritus at Yale University. In fact, he says, the Sophists, who taught rhetoric in Athens during the fifth century b.c., were "the first professors of the humanities," and they "created an education designed for the first great democracy." The birth of Athenian democracy in that century had created a need for a new edu- cation. Whether to win a majority in the Assembly for a desired policy, or just to win a verdict for oneself in the new courts of law, Athenians now found "the art of persuasion" to be the key to success. And the Sophists - such as Protagoras, Gorgias, and Hippias - were professionals in that art. "Protagoras offered to teach, for a price . . . how to make the weaker case ap- pear the stronger. This, of course, is the essence of the art of persuasion: it is the weaker case that needs the rhetoric." But although rhetoric was its core, the Soph- ists' educational program also included, in rudimentary form, all the liberal arts, Knox says. For the ancient Greeks, Homer and other poets were the authorities on questions of conduct and belief, and the Sophists all claimed to be interpreters of poetry. Their discussions might begin as literary critiques, but they then moved eas- ily into the moral and political realms. The Sophists, Knox says, "encouraged their students to question every received idea, to subject age-old concepts of the relationship between man and god, man and society, to the criterion of reasoned, organized discussion." For the first time in Athenian history, he says, doubts were ex- pressed about the superiority of Greeks to barbarians, and there was debate over the position of women in society, of political equality, and even of slavery. Plato, who turned the word Sophist into a term of abuse, "also, though this aspect of his work is seldom mentioned, tried to suppress the new humanities," Knox points out. "It was perfectly logical that he should do so. They had been created to provide education in citizenship for that democracy which Plato loathed and de- spised, not only because it had put his mas- ter Socrates to death but also because he saw clearly the real flaws of Athenian im- perial democracy - its inability to main- tain a stable policy, its encouragement of sycophancy and political corruption." But Plato also perceived as flaws of democracy "what in fact were its virtues - its open- ness to new ideas, its freedom of speech." In the fifth century b.c. as today, Knox says, the humanities were on the defen- sive. Now, the "canon" of the great books of Western civilization is being attacked; but then, too, the humanities were under fire. Then as now, "they were vulnerable to the accusation that they posed questions but gave no definitive answers; that their effect was often unsettling, if not subver- sive; that they made their devotees unfit for real life." But the humanities came into being as an education for democ- racy - and that, Knox says, is still the strongest argument for them.

And now two well-known writers - poet and Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz, in New Perspectives Quarterly (Spring 1991), and neoconservative thinker Irving Kristol, in Commen- tary (Aug. 1991) - dare to predict that religion may enjoy a revival in the 21st century. Czeslaw Milosz; [The 18th century] has been called The Age of Reason and our scientific-technological civiliza- tion has been traced back to the basic premises laid down by thinkers and scientists of that time .... What should surprise us about that century is its optimism .... Human reason ap- proached then the super-abundance of existing phenomena with a confidence in its own unlim- ited forces because God assigned to it the task of discovering the marvels of His creation. [It] was The Age of Pious Reason .... The next century, the 1 9th, would exacerbate some tendencies of its predecessor and elabo- rate what can be called a scientific Weltanschaung [worldview], in fact quite dis- tant from those harmonious visions of the earlier scientists. Destructive of values, it would prompt Friedrich Nietzsche to announce the advent of "European nihilism." . . . I would be wary in joining all those who hail the new physics as the beginning of an era of recovered harmony .... Yet I am more cynical when in the biochemist Jacques Monod's Chance and Necessity / find his desperate state- ment about the one-way path we are launched on by science: "a track which 19th-century sci- entism saw leading infallibly upward to an em- pyrean noon hour of mankind, whereas what we see opening before us today is an abyss of darkness." I think Jacques Monod was writing a dirge to bygone attitudes, while science now again stands before a breath-taking, miraculous spectacle of unsuspected complexity and it is the new physics which is responsible for this change of orientation .... The theory of quanta, inde- pendently of conclusions drawn from it . . . restores the mind to its role of a co-creator in the fabric of reality. This favors a shift from belittling man as an insignificant speck in the immensity of galaxies to regarding him again as the main actor in the universal drama .... The enthusiasm of the 18th-century scientists who searched for an objective order looks naive to- day, yet I sense at the end of our century some- thing like a renewal of a hopeful tone. Irving Kristoh We have, in recent years, observed two major events that represent turning points in the his- tory of the 20th century. The first is the death of socialism, both as an ideal and a political pro- gram .... The second is the collapse of secular humanism - the religious basis of socialism - as an ideal, but not yet as an ideological program, a way of life. [However,] as the ideal is wither- ing awav, the real will sooner or later follow suit. If one looks back at the intellectual history of this century, one sees the rationalist religion of secular humanism gradually losing its credibility even as it marches triumphantly through the in- stitutions of our society - through the schools, the courts, the churches, the media. This loss of credibility flows from two fundamental flaws in secular humanism. First, the philosophical rationalisfn of secular humanism can, at best, provide us with a state- ment of the necessary1 assumptions of a moral code, but it cannot deliver any such code it- self .... For a long time now, the Western world has been leading a kind of schizophrenic existence, with a prevailing moral code inherited from the Judeo-Christian tradition and a set of secular- humanist beliefs about the nature and destiny of man to which that code is logically irrelevant. Inevitably, belief in the moral code has become more and more attenuated over time, as we have found ourselves baffled by the Nietzschean challenge: if God is really dead, by what author- ity do we say any particular practice is prohib- ited or permitted? . . . A second flaw in secular humanism is even more fundamental . ... If there is one indisput- able fact about the human condition it is that no community can survive if it is persuaded - or even if it suspects - that its members are leading meaningless lives in a meaningless universe .... As the spirit of secular humanism loses its mo- mentum, it is reasonable to anticipate that reli- gion will play a more central role in American life.

American Enterprise (July-Aug. 1 99 1), American Enterprise PrOteStant EthlC _, 1 . Inst, 1 150 17th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Protestant evangelicalism has made great inroads in traditionally Catholic Latin America. Evangelicals - most of them Pentecostals, who practice faith healing and speaking in tongues - have grown from 15 million in 1960 to over 40 million. More than half of them live in Brazil, mak- ing up nearly one-fifth of its 150 million people. Sociologist Peter Berger and oth- ers think that the evangelical upsurge will encourage the growth of capitalism and democracy in Latin America, just as the spread of Calvinism and the Protestant ethic did in Europe beginning in the 16th century. But this may be too optimistic a reading, cautions Goodman, a research as- sociate at the American Enterprise Insti- tute. Evangelicalism, he says, is "more likely to retard than to hasten the onset of 'modernity' in Latin America." Berger, sociologist David Martin, and other optimists, notes Goodman, contend that evangelicalism "inculcates a 'bour- geois' message of self-improvement, tames machismo, fosters peaceability, and en- courages hard work as a service to God. It promotes the 'small' capitalist virtues of dependability, thrift, and sobriety." It also encourages self-reliance and skills and practices conducive to self-government. Yet, Goodman argues, evangelicalism still promotes "values typical of traditional society." It scants such "modern" values as individualism, rationalism, "the need for achievement, and identification with society at large rather than just the imme- diate family circle." Latin American evan- gelicals are inclined "more toward emo- tionalism and superstition . . . than toward rationalism," he says. Their religion seems to breed disharmony rather than a sense of the common good: "Competition, rancor, and polarization are often rife among, and even within, their churches." Nor is it likely, in Goodman's view, that evangelicalism "will unleash the acquisi- tive drive." Evangelicalism "upholds ta- boos against the accumulation of material things; Pentecostals work hard for many reasons, but making money is rarely prom- inent among them." Perhaps most important, even if the new religion should provide "a positive cul- tural context" for modernization, that would not be enough to lift Latin America out of poverty. The new culture could not by itself overcome "the economic and po- litical factors - especially statist economic policies, weak political institutions, and in- ept leadership - that historically have left the region underdeveloped and poorly governed." That will require fundamental reforms. Latin America may blaze a path to the promised land of prosperity, but "[a] Protestant Reformation alone will not do it and may not even contribute to it."

For decades, biology textbooks have held up the viceroy butterfly as a classic exam- ple of Batesian mimicry. The bright or- ange wings of the viceroy (Limenitis archippus) closely resemble those of the toxic monarch (Danaus plexippus), and bi- ologists have long believed that the viceroy was concealing an appetizing body be- neath its monarch-like colors.

It's ironic that its reports should be so dull to read," says novelist Michael Crichton, au- thor of The Andromeda Strain and other works. In American Scientist (Jan. -Feb. 1991), he speculates about the source of this barrier between layman and expert. / have often been struck by the fact that scien- tists in conversation are crisp and clear about their work. The same scientists, writing in a journal produce a nightmare of incom- prehensibility. Various explanations have been proposed, but I think the real problem may be structural Scientific writing now de- mands a passive, abstract literary form. In conversation, the scientist provides in- formation in the way we ordinarily expect to receive it: as a narrative. "We had an unan- swered question in our field. The question was important for these reasons. So we ap- proached it in this way. Here's what hap- pened when we did." . . . Unfortunately, science has chosen to re- place active personalized storytelling with passive abstract discourse. It's the difference between saying "I got up this morning and wrote a letter to American Scientist" and saying "Letter-writing on some mornings may occur/' Passive abstraction has many drawbacks. Since nobody in the real world communi- cates this way, it's an alien mode that we must shift into, like a foreign language. It's a struggle to write. It's agony to read. Particu- larly in reports of experiments, it doesn't re- flect what actually happened. But most im- portant, abstraction actually provides less information than narrative, by removing the flavors, the feelings, the juice, and sometimes even the substance Of course there are historical and intellec- tual reasons why scientists choose to deper- sonalize their reports. But the absence of the observer is no longer so fashionable a posture as it once was. It may be time for scientists to return to the more vigorous prose tradition of Galileo. species of butterfly tasty to birds could thus protect itself. New research, however, indicates that it is scientists, not birds, whom the viceroy has been deceiving all these years, reports Tim Walker, an intern at Science News. The butterflies' secret was revealed in an avian taste test conducted by David B. Ritland and Lincoln P. Brower of the Uni- versity of Florida, Gainesville. The wing- less abdomens of viceroys, monarchs, and other butterfly species were served up to local red-winged blackbirds. Despite the textbook wisdom, the birds found the vice- roy just as unappetizing as the monarch. In fact, the birds frequently turned up their beaks after just one peck. The results "clearly refute the traditional hypothesis that viceroys are palatable Batesian mimics," Ritland and Brower said. Why had scientists assumed that the viceroy was a taste treat? In part simply because the viceroy evolved from admiral butterflies, which are known to be tasty. But also because the viceroy, in its cater- pillar stage, does not feed on poisonous plants - the only way, many biologists have believed, that a butterfly could ac- quire toxic chemicals. But the viceroy, it seems, knew better. High Drama "The Height of Ambition" by David H. DeVorkin, in Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian (Apr. -May 1991), 370 L'Enfant Promenade S.W., 10th FL, Washington, D.C. 20024. In the 1920s and 30s, the stratosphere beckoned to both adventurers and scien- tists. But their interests in exploring it were not the same, and a conflict devel- oped that foreshadowed the debate in later decades over manned versus unmanned exploration of space. To prewar scientists, explains DeVorkin, curator of astronomy and space sciences at the National Air and Space Museum's department of space history, the strato- sphere offered a chance "to solve the rid- WQ AUTUMN 1991 127</page><page sequence="18">PERIODICALS National Geographic offered eager readers this scorecard on the lt stratosphere race" in 1936. die of the elusive 'cosmic ray/" a mysteri- ous form of highly penetrating radiation first detected in 1912. But- just as in the space age - finding answers to "arcane questions . . . couldn't fire public imagina- tion and generate financial support." What did capture the public's imagina- tion was the spectacle of men in hydro- gen-filled balloons daring to ascend into the perilously thin air of the stratosphere, which begins some seven miles above the earth's surface and extends for 24. To these bold explorers, ever intent on setting new records, "science was little more than an excuse to make bigger and better flights," DeVorkin says. Scientists who pre- ferred use of unmanned balloons grew to resent the high-flying adventurers. Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard (1884- 1962) was an experienced balloonist who, as DeVorkin writes, "decided to make his mark in physics by combining his passions for flight and science: he would create a sealed, pressurized, manned laboratory that could be flown by balloon into the stratosphere to solve die mystery of the cosmic ray." Ascending from Augsburg, Bavaria, on May 27, 1931, Piccard and an assistant went up nearly 10 miles, a record. "The sky is beautiful up there - almost black," Piccard wrote in an ac- count for National Geographic. The aero- nauts ran into unanticipated difficulties in their descent but finally landed safely. Piccard's flight made him a celebrity, but he had had time to make just one cos- mic ray observation, and other scientists gave it little credence. By then, however, DeVorkin writes, "scientists using other means had found the origin of the cosmic ray to be indeed cosmic." Four years later, the final flight of the era took place. Albert W. Stevens and Orvil Anderson of the Army Air Corps went up in Explorer II on Nov. 11, 1935, and set a new record of nearly 14 miles. Because an earlier flight in a hydrogen- filled balloon had ended with the balloon's explosion, the Explorer II balloon was filled with helium. This increased the mar- gin of safety for the men aboard, DeVorkin says, but it also considerably reduced such WQ AUTUMN 1991 128</page><page sequence="19">PERIODICALS scientific value as the flight might have had. Because helium has less lifting capac- ity than hydrogen, half the scientific equip- ment that was supposed be aboard had to be dumped. As would become evident three decades later, the debate over manned-versus-unmanned exploration of the high frontier was far from over. False Prophets "Great Expectations: Why Technology Predictions Go Awry" by Herb Brody, in Technology Review (July 1991), Building W59, MIT, Cambridge, Mass. 02139. It was the bright world of tomorrow. Solar cells and nuclear fusion were to provide pollution-free electricity, automobiles were to run on batteries, factories were to rely extensively on robots, and videotex terminals were to be important fixtures in American homes. But the technological fu- ture envisioned just a few years ago has failed to arrive, notes Brody, a senior edi- tor of Technology Review. Innovations like nuclear fusion "seem, as always, to be at least a decade from practicality." That's the way it usually goes with ex- perts' technological forecasts, Brody says. And the result, he adds, is not just red faces but misspent scientific careers and misallocated money for research. Why are the much-publicized predic- tions so often wrong? Several factors are involved, according to Brody. One is con- flicts of interest. "Interested parties in- clude not only the companies that stand to make money from a technology but also scientists whose funding grows and wanes with the level of public excitement." Re- searchers working on nuclear fusion, for instance, "have kept up a steady barrage of 'breakthrough' reports since the mid- 1970s." Consulting firms such as Dataquest and Business Communications, which analyze the business potential of emerging tech- nologies, feed the bonfires of optimism. "Over the past decade," Brody writes, "outfits like these have foretold billion-dol- lar markets for artificial intelligence, videotex, and virtually every other new technology that laboratories have re- ported." Part of the problem is that the market researchers survey the wrong peo- ple: the new technology's vendors. Survey- ing potential buyers would make for more realistic projections, but also would be much more expensive. The news media, of course, are ever willing to give hype a hand. Once pub- lished, the forecasts of "the experts" take on a life of their own. False optimism about new technologies is also encouraged by underestimating the potential of old ones. "Theoretically, it's been possible for the past 25 years for computers to eliminate photographic film," says Du Pont executive Alexander MacLachlan. But thanks to continuing chemical refinements, he notes, silver-ha- lide film has remained in the center of the picture. "Any truly revolutionary technology de- fies easy prediction," Brody says. Com- puter designers in the mid-1970s still aimed to build ever larger behemoths. Few appreciated the value of personal ma- chines. In fact, Brody says, from IBM's study then of what computer users said they wanted, the firm "reportedly concluded . . . that PCs would appeal only to a small group of hobbyists." A Plague Of Scientists? "Do We Need More Ph.D.'s, or Is Fewer Really Better?" by Constance Holden, in Science (Mar. 1, 1991), American Assoc. for the Advancement of Science, 1333 H St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Some specialists are worried that the United States is producing too few scien- tists, but not Georgia State University economist Paula Stephan. She thinks there already are far too many of them, reports Holden, a Science writer. WQ AUTUMN 1991 129</page><page sequence="20">PERIODICALS There has indeed been a huge growth in the number of Ph.D. scientists during the past half-century. In 1940, there were 320 doctoral scientists and engineers for every one million Americans over the age of 22; by 1966, the total had reached 778, and now it stands at 2,000. This vast increase in quantity, Stephan maintains, has resulted in a discernible decrease in quality. "The average quality of people going into science in the 70s and early '80s," Stephan claims, "was not as high as in the '50s and '60s in terms of motivation, abil- ity, and interest in science." In the 1970s, according to studies by Stephan and Sharon G. Levin of the University of Mis- souri, recent Ph.D.'s in particle physics were producing, over a two-year period, an average of nine fewer articles than their predecessors in the 1950s did. The quality of an individual scientist's work suffers when he does not have ade- quate resources, stimulating colleagues, and due recognition, she argues. These are available at top-level research institutions and national laboratories, but most new science positions have been created else- where. A physicist's chance of being at one of those "right places" plummeted from 50 percent in 1963 to 17 percent in 1973. The large number of scientists, asserts Stephan, also has encouraged intense competition among them, with the result being not only an inordinate amount of time spent chasing research grants but a general avoidance of research that could be important but may well not pan out. Further contributing to the putative de- cline in the quality of scientists, Stephan contends, has been the shift by increasing numbers of very bright students, starting in the early 1970s, away from scientific ca- reers and toward the more lucrative fields of business, law, and medicine. Critics of Stephan's argument are not in short supply, Holden found. "The young assistant professors I've seen are more ca- pable and more brilliant than ever in the past," asserts Richard Atkinson, chancel- lor of the University of California, San Diego. Critics say that more Ph.D. scien- tists are required to sustain the U.S. econo- my's technological edge. Unless "we're just going to change the whole society we're living in," Atkinson says, we need to have more scientists. RESOURCES &amp; ENVIRONMENT Going To Market For Cleaner Air? "Incentive-Based Regulation: A New Era from an Old Idea?" by Robert W. Hahn and Robert N. Stavins, in Ecology Law Quar- terly (Vol. 18, No. 1, 1991), Boalt Hall School of Law, Univ. of Calif., Berkeley, Calif. 94720. For more than two decades, economists have been pushing the idea of market- based environmental regulation. In recent years, Congress and others involved in making policy have started to listen. When the Clean Air Act was overhauled last year, for example, Congress and the Bush ad- ministration included a "tradeable per- mit" system for controlling acid rain. Un- der this scheme, companies are permitted to generate certain levels of sulfur dioxide; if they keep their emissions below those levels, they can then sell their surplus per- mits to other firms. This gives companies economic incentives to keep their emis- sions down. In the past, Congress and the Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) have fa- vored the "command-and-control" ap- proach to environmental protection, compelling firms to use certain pollution- control equipment or to meet certain emission standards. That sort of regulatory approach may work to control pollution, say Hahn, a resi- dent scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Stavins, a Harvard professor of public policy, but the method is inef- WQ AUTUMN 1991 130</page><page sequence="21">PERIODICALS ficient (because the costs vary greatly among firms) and expensive to society. Since 1984, die cost of compliance with U.S. environmental regulations has in- creased nearly 40 percent and now stands at about $90 billion a year. Set against a backdrop of fiscal austerity and concern about improving U.S. firms' productivity and competitiveness, the high cost of com- mand-and-control environmental protec- tion has made political leaders and envi- ronmentalists much more receptive to market-oriented ways of pursuing the same goal. The Environmental Defense Fund, for example, has become "an enthu- siastic proponent" of such approaches, the authors say, and the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society now back "se- lective use" of them. Economic-incentive methods have been employed in the past on a limited basis. In 1982-87, the EPA, in its successful drive to reduce use of lead in gasoline, used a per- mit system that let fuel refiners "bank" and "trade" their lead-content savings. Other market-oriented devices have been put into use here and abroad. Nine states, for example, seeking to reduce litter, have mandatory deposit laws in effect for bot- tles and cans. France, the Netherlands, and Germany curb water pollution by means of fees or taxes. Hahn and Stavins say they are "bullish" on the use of economic incentives but still think they will remain limited. EPA bu- reaucrats, environmentalists, and others have a great deal invested in the status quo. Even industry lobbyists in Washing- ton display a "curious resistance" to mar- ket-oriented reforms. Like their oppo- nents, their stock-in-trade is manipulation of the existing system; new rules for play- ing the game are a threat (and might, at least at first, cost some industries more). But despite all the resistance, the authors say, economic-incentive proposals are go- ing to get "a warmer reception" from poli- cymakers in the years ahead. Too Hot To Handle "Risk Perception, Trust, and Nuclear Waste: Lessons from Yucca Mountain" by Paul SI o vie, Mark Layman, and James H. Flynn, in Environment (Apr. 1991), Heldref Publications, 4000 Albemarle St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20016. When it comes to the disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste, expert appraisal and public opinion could not be more op- posed. Government and industry scientists say that spent fuel from the nation's 111 commercial nuclear reactors - each one generating about 30 tons of high-level nu- clear waste every year - can be safely stored in deep, underground repositories for tens of thousands of years. The risks involved are negligible, most specialists say. Yet the public regards those risks as immense and unacceptable. In Nevada, in- tense opposition from both state officials and residents has stymied the U.S. Energy Department's efforts to evaluate Yucca Mountain as a potential site for a perma- nent nuclear waste storage facility. Surveys that psychologist Slovic, presi- dent of Decision Research, and his col- leagues conducted in 1988-90 asked peo- ple to reveal the thoughts or images that came to mind in response to the term un- derground nuclear waste repository. More than half the 10,000 responses were nega- tive, and the words most often expressed were dangerous, danger, death, and pollu- tion. Positive images were rare. The public's fears, the authors say, rep- resent "a profound breakdown of public trust in the scientific, governmental, and industrial managers of nuclear technol- ogies." Restoring this trust will not be easy, they observe, especially in light of past Energy Department "mismanage- ment" of the Yucca Mountain project. The only feasible course, they conclude, "is to delay the siting of a permanent repository for several decades and to store the wastes wherever they are produced in the interim in dry-cask storage." Accord- ing to the National Research Council, they note, such storage is "as safe as under- ground storage" for 120-150 years.

Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1821 called poets "the unacknowledged legislators of the world." But Ludwig van Beethoven (1770- 1827) had already staked out a similar claim on behalf of a genuinely lowly group: musicians. In fact, it was Beetho- ven, according to journalist-historian Johnson, who "first established and popu- larized the notion of the artist as universal genius, as a moral figure in his own right - indeed, as a kind of intermediary between God and Man." Musicians in the late 18th century were minor church functionaries or servants of the aristocracy. Music was seen as an aes- thetically inferior art because its appeal, intense but brief, was confined to the senses. Unlike poetry, philosopher Im- manuel Kant (1724-1804) said, music did not "leave anything over for reflections." Such attitudes changed after about 1800, Johnson writes, when "music was seen as increasingly significant because it height- ened self-awareness, now regarded as de- sirable Emotion . . . created forms of knowledge as serious as reason, and mu- sic, as a key to it, became more serious, too." Music was used to enhance the higher arts; poetry was made into songs, operas, and even symphonies. Beethoven altered the form and content of music. Eighteenth-century opera was, for the most part, about sexual intrigue; Beethoven's Fidelio (1805) "shift[ed] the ground fundamentally to the brotherhood of man and the glory of fidelity." His Fifth Symphony in C Minor, composed two years later, "operates at the highest level of human intellect and emotion," Johnson observes. Music, the composer insisted, "is a greater revelation than the whole of wis- dom and philosophy." A Roman Catholic, Beethoven was not consciously trying to turn music into a sec- ular religion. Nevertheless, says Johnson, for increasing numbers of people, "the new kind of transcendent music Beetho- ven wrote, and the new importance he gave to music in the intellectual and moral cosmos, did constitute a secular substitute for religion; there was a new faith, and Beethoven was its prophet." The Performing Teacher "The Great-Teacher Myth" by Robert B. Heilman, in The Ameri- can Scholar (Summer 1991), 1811 Q St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009. The 1989 film Dead Poets Society, about the style and influence of a charismatic teacher at a boys' preparatory school, was popular with audiences and praised by many critics. The New Yorker deemed the movie "a classic." What is strange, ob- serves Heilman, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Washington at Seattle, is that the character whom audi- ences are supposed to look upon as the ideal teacher, John Keating (Robin Wil- liams), never does any real teaching. "What we see is moonlight larks and for- est frolics - midsummer nights' dream fantasies taken for actualities, instead of that steady book work, aided by sensible explication, that might lead to some edu- cation." Keating, the professor says, "is not a teacher at all but a performer," one who has cast himself in a single, lifetime role - "the gutsy, charismatic, infallible, one-in-a-million guide against the system." Any system needs serious critics, Heilman adds, "but Keating is only a guy with a mike in a midnight show." Dead Poets Society, he says, missed what the 1969 film The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, also about a star teacher, did not. In that movie, based on a Muriel Spark novel, "we see the full character: the self- worship and power-love of the spectacular teacher who manages to seem superior to WQ AUTUMN 1991 132</page><page sequence="23">PERIODICALS About This Mona Lisa Fed up with "the red rant of unearned praise/' novelist Stanley Elkin fires away in Art &amp; Antiques (Summer 1991) at some "overrated masterpieces," from Hamlet to Citizen Kane.

See the long, low-slung nose dropped inches below the painterly rules of thumb. Now see her famous statelies, her upright, comfortable aplomb, her left forearm along the arm of a chair, her fat right hand covering it, as clubby and at ease as one foot crossed over an- other In and closer in to the central occasion of her odd, asexual face, in where the mystery lives, the secret agenda, in toward her giacondas, her giaconundrums, the hidden mystery of her guarded gingivitis smile! Be- cause I'm changing my mind here, a little I am, and thinking maybe it's Nat King Cole's version I'm not that crazy about, his viscous syrups I'm thinking of, confusing the box-step cliché and sentimentals with the fact of her face. Because what levers our attention is that nose and those lips, and a truth about art is the company it keeps with the slightly askew, the fly in that woodpile of symmetry, mere balance in painting, equilibrium, a stunt of the "beautiful." What commissions the eye is face It's the face that draws the eye in the Mona Lisa, but I was only kidding about the mystery of that smile. There is no mystery. No one ever had to solve a face, and the notion of this face's enigmatics has al- ways been a kind of anthropomorphism, only paint's pathetic fallacy, facial phrenology, a horoscopics by bone structure, an astrology of the eye, the palmistry of character, wrong- headed, literary, the racism of beauty, unreli- able finally as any other pseudoscience, as if to say, oh, as if to say, Read my lips."

The Keating-Brodie type has its counter- parts in real life, and these self-loving per- formers, always playing the malcontent, do serve a function, in Heilman's view. They provide an outlet for students' melo- dramatic "discontents, suspicions, and negative judgments." In short, while the Keatingesque Great Teacher may seldom, if ever, be a good teacher, he does make a fine institutional safety valve. Propagandists License "Genius and Glory: John Singleton Copley's The Death of Major Peirson" by Richard H. Saunders, in The American Art Journal (Vol. XXII, No. 3, 1990), 40 W. 57th St., 5th fl., New York, N.Y. 10019. John Singleton Copley's The Death of Ma- jor Peirson (1784) was a masterpiece and possibly the finest British historical paint- ing of the 18th century. Yet, like the en- graving of the Boston Massacre that strongly influenced it, Copley's painting played fast and loose with certain histori- cal facts. Copley (1738-1815), who had been a successful portrait painter in colonial Bos- ton, was by 1781 well established as a painter in London. That January, French forces invaded the Channel island of Jer- sey and obtained its surrender; British forces, led by Major Francis Peirson, ig- nored the surrender order of the island's WQ AUTUMN 1991 133</page><page sequence="24">PERIODICALS Copley gave a military skirmish great national import. lieutenant governor, advanced on the main town's central square, and routed the French. In the moment of triumph, however, young Peirson was fatally shot. Copley sensed the appeal that Peirson's sacrifice and the modest military victory might have to Englishmen, dispirited by years of martial failure in the American colonies. In his rendition, Copley did want historical accuracy - but only up to a point, according to Saunders, director of the Christian A. Johnson Memorial Gallery at Middlebury College. Copley believed "that it was not the artist's duty to depict reality. On the contrary, it was the artist's responsibility to elevate reality to a level beyond that of simple reporting, to com- municate values such as nobility and sacri- fice to future generations." Other artists had taken a less elevated approach to the Jersey battle. In the center of the earliest picture, by Thomas Gram Colley and E. Hedges, Scottish troops of the 78th Highland Regi- ment, led by officers in kilts and tam-o'shanters, advance in rows, fir- ing on the retreating French. One Highlander, meanwhile, rushes to assist the wounded Peirson, who braces himself against a building near where his troops entered the square. In placing him at the edge of the scene, Saunders notes, the artists "chose reportage over drama." Copley, by contrast (and despite at least one battlefield account), put Peirson at center stage, falling dra- matically "into the arms of his mili- tary subalterns." He relegated the Scottish Highlanders to far less prominent posi- tions. It was English noble sacrifice that the painting was to display, after all. He also added a splendidly attired black ser- vant, who avenges Peirson's death - but who probably did not exist. Copley drew inspiration for his master- piece from the 1770 print of the Boston Massacre, which depicted a similar scene. Paul Revere, who received most of the credit for the print, had taken the idea from an almost identical one by Copley's half-brother, Henry Pelham. Effective as radical propaganda, the Revere-Pelham portrayal of the massacre had little to do with what actually happened: Boston toughs provoked British troops into firing on them. Just over a decade later, Copley transformed the "graphic image of colo- nial hatred" into a masterful portrayal of "the glory of British military prowess." OTHER NATIONS The 'Perfect Dictatorship9 "Mexico: The Crumbling of the 'Perfect Dictatorship' " by An- drew Reding, in World Policy Journal (Spring 1991), World Pol- icy Inst, New School for Social Research, 777 United Nations Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10017. Long hidden by a veil of constitutional de- mocracy, Mexico's system of presidential absolutism (présidentialisme*) is increas- ingly being seen, by Mexicans and foreign- ers alike, as a de facto form of dictatorship, says Reding, a Senior Fellow at the World Policy Institute. Indeed, when Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa declared in WQ AUTUMN 1991 134</page><page sequence="25">PERIODICALS 1990 that Mexico was a "perfect dictator- ship," having all the characteristics of a dictatorship except the appearance of one, his phrase was widely repeated inside Mex- ico. Yet this very fact, Reding points out, "is itself a clear sign that the 'perfect dic- tatorship' is no longer so perfect." A new political culture, stressing respect for democracy and human rights, has emerged in Mexico. The catalyst for it, Reding says, was the July 1988 presidential elections, in which there were allegations of massive vote fraud. When early returns on election night showed opposition lead- er Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the lead, the U.S.-style computerized vote tabulation system that was providing returns over na- tional television suddenly went dead. The votes instead were counted "the old-fash- ioned way." After a week's delay, the offi- cial results were released, showing an old- fashioned result: Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the long-ruling Institutional Revolution- ary Party (PRI) was the winner. Cardenas, however, would not follow "the old rules, whereby he might have rec- ognized a Salinas presidency in exchange for more favorable treatment of his coali- tion in the Senate and at the state and local levels." The next year, he founded a new party, whose very name - the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) - under- scored his challenge. "The PRD's call for a revolutionary change in the way Mexico is governed," Reding observes, "has, in ef- fect, transformed every election in which it participates into a referendum on authoritarian rule." Today, Reding says, "the culture of prési- dentialisme* appears more naked than at any time since the ill-fated reign of Porfirio Diaz [the dictator overthrown in 1911]. The emerging democratic culture rejects the absolutist presidency outright, insisting on a true separation of powers, indepen- dent electoral authorities, a genuine multi- party system, and strict enforcement of in- ternationally recognized standards of human rights." While these ideas are not new, Reding points out, their incorpora- tion into a political movement is. Although the Salinas administration has overhauled the nation's electoral system, Reding says, the vaunted reforms still re- flect "a pervasive distrust of democracy, a continuing obsession with the trauma of 1988, and a determination to reconstruct the damaged foundations of presidencialis- mo." Salinas may continue to hold power, Reding concludes, "but nothing short of genuine democracy can now restore re- spect for the presidency." iv±kjju,*, AAoXlP "Are R-ussians Lazy?" by S. Frederick Starr, in World Monitor iv±kjju,*, (June 1991) j Norway St Boston Mass 021 15. In Moscow Many Western observers, and not a few Russian ones, have expressed skepticism about the prospects for democratic change in the Soviet Union. Democracy and free enterprise, they say, require a capacity for independent initiative that, after centuries of czars and decades of commissars, most Russians don't have. Not so, says historian Starr, president of Oberlin College. "There is much evidence that the stereo- type of passive Russians who lack civic ini- tiative is dead wrong," he declares. "Take the economy, for instance. If Russians are so lacking in initiative, how did a huge pri- vate (if illegal) sector arise even during the repressive Brezhnev years?" This "second economy," according to U.S. researchers, produced half of all personal income. Pri- vate entrepreneurs, by Soviet estimates in 1986, accounted for 20 percent of all retail trade, 30 percent of the service sector, and 40 percent of businesses in areas from auto repairs to tailoring. Although Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev "has stated repeatedly that the public is hostile to private enterprise," the All Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion in Moscow found that a third of Russians would open their own businesses if they could do so legally; a quarter of the rest are put off from doing so only by a lack of access to credit or by fear that the WQ AUTUMN 1991 135</page><page sequence="26">PERIODICALS state would seize whatever they earned. "If Russians are too pas- sive to assert their will against the entrenched po- litical establishment, one would scarcely expect them to form independent groups to press their demands," Starr notes. Yet that is just what has happened in re- cent years, as thousands of lobbying clubs and associa- tions of all types have been set up. Labor has estab- lished independent unions, many patterned on Poland's Solidarity. Lawyers, journal- ists, and other professionals also have organized their own groups. Independent political parties have already come to power in most non-Russian republics, and organization is proceeding rapidly in the far-flung territory of the Russian Republic. Despite "the stereotypical images ad- vanced by those in Russia and the West who are eager to justify the Kremlin's new authoritarianism as a necessary evil," Starr says, there is "ample evidence that Rus- Unlike these supposed Soviet heroes of production in Natalia Levitina's "The 'Vanguard' of Perestroika," many Russians have ample capacity for independent initiative, says historian Starr. sians, freed from fear, possess as much ini- tiative and capacity for independent action as do members of other developed soci- eties in Europe, Asia, and the Americas." The West, he says, should accept "at face value" the democratic movement in the Soviet Union, not "belittle it simply be- cause it has not, in a mere five years, tri- umphed completely over the old system." Premature Reunification "Germany and the Cold War: An Inquest" by Jacob E. Heilbrunn, in Global Affairs (Summer 1991), International Se- curity Council, 1155 15th St. N.W., Ste. 502, Washington, D.C. 20005. German reunification, finally accom- plished in 1990, might have come about almost four decades earlier. Heilbrunn, a writer and former assistant editor at the National Interest, says that it was probably a good thing that it did not. On March 10, 1952, Soviet leader Josef Stalin sent a note to die U.S., British, and French governments, in which he pro- posed creation of a unified, neutral Ger- many. Could this proposal, asks Heil- brunn, have been an opportunity to unify Germany on minimally acceptable terms, one that, had it been seized, might have spared East Germans nearly four decades of totalitarian rule? The allies at the time looked upon Stalin's note with great suspicion, seeing in it a tactical move to block formation of the European Defense Community. Yet the U.S. State Department and Britain's White- hall took the dictator's proposal seriously. When Stalin later in the month advanced a revised version, the State Department Pol- icy Planning Staff commented that "It would be unwise to assume that the note is only a propaganda move." Kurt Schumacher, leader of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), enthusias- tically agreed. He wanted to see "an inde- pendent, unified Germany - and unified precisely because it was independent," WQ AUTUMN 1991 136</page><page sequence="27">PERIODICALS Heilbrunn says. "Schu- macher was pro- Western, but ... he was convinced that by championing social democracy, the SPD could bring the eastern zone into its orbit A unified, dem- ocratic Germany would jockey for advantage be- tween East and West." He therefore was eager to see the allies enter negotiations to create such a Germany. West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Union viewed Stalin's pro- posal with alarm, and he persuaded the allies to re- buff it. According to Heilbrunn, Adenauer told the Americans that even to agree to a conference with the Soviets on the subject "would open the door to bringing Germany into the Soviet orbit." The chancel- lor "had no confidence in the German people," ob- served Sir Ivone Kirkpat- rick, head of the British Foreign Office in the 1950s. As a result, he "felt that the integration of Western Ger- many with the West was more important than the unification of Germany." In the view of German historian Rolf Steininger, Adenauer thus lost a chance to find out whether it was possible then to have "a Germany united in freedom." But Heil- brunn says that while Adenauer's rejection of Stalin's offer was indeed "a turning point," the reasoning behind it was sound. "Adenauer spurned negotiations," Heilbrunn writes, "not because he re- jected unification per se - it remained the official aim of the [Federal Republic of Germany] and was enshrined in the pre- amble to its Grundgesetz, or Basic Law - but because, unlike Schumacher, he un- derstood that the German problem could not be solved in isolation from a solution for Eastern Europe and because he fore- saw circumstances in which German unifi- cation would come about in a manner much more advantageous for Germany and Europe." Nearly four decades later, events seem to have proved that Adenauer was right. Vargas Llosa's Lament Although novelist Mario Vargas Llosa was a strong candi- date, he was defeated last year in his bid to become presi- dent of Peru. His larger purpose, however, had been to get across to Peruvians his ideas about political and economic freedom, and about creating a truly free society. In Granta 36 (Summer 1991), Vargas Llosa, a former Wilson Center Fellow, ponders the impact of ideas in politics. To what extent did we manage to make ideas put down roots among libertarians? To what extent did the Peruvians who voted for me vote for liberal ideas? I don't know. These are doubts that I would like very much to clear up, since they hold the key to whether the effort of these years was useless or worthwhile. I had already seen that ideas mattered little . . . that real politics, not the kind that one reads and writes and thinks about - the only sort that I had been acquainted with - but the politics that is lived and practiced day by day, has little to do with ideas, values and imagination, with long-range vi- sions, with notions of an ideal society, with generosity, soli- darity or idealism. It consists almost exclusively of maneu- vers, intrigues, plots, pacts, paranoias, betrayals, a great deal of calculation, no little cynicism and every variety of con game. What really gets professional politicians moving, whether of the center, the left or the right, what excites them and drives them on, is power; attaining it, remaining in it or returning to it as soon as possible. There are exceptions, of course, but they are just that: exceptions. Many politicians begin their careers impelled by altruistic sentiments, by the desire to change society, promote justice, improve the stand- ard of living. But along the way, in the petty, pedestrian prac- tice that politics is, the fine objectives cease to exist, become mere commonplaces of speeches and programs. Anyone who is not capable of feeling the obsessive, almost physical attraction to power finds it nearly impossible to be a success- ful politician. No, finally, I don't believe that I succeeded in putting across what I wanted to. Peruvians did not vote for ideas in the elections .... [The] weekly polls always showed that the candidate who was attracting voters was doing so on the basis of his personality or out of some mysterious impulse: never on account of the program on offer.
