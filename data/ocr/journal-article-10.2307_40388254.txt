<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rites in the dark? An evaluation of the current evidence for ritual areas at Magdalenian cave sites Pablo Arias Abstract It is likely that ritual activity existed (and even played an important role) in the life of Upper Palaeolithic groups. However, rites are among the aspects of human behaviour most elusive to archaeological research. In this paper, we will analyse the evidence from several Magdalenian cave sites where the existence of 'sanctuaries' or other kinds of ritual activity has been claimed. The available methods for the evaluation of this kind of area will be discussed, and a preliminary assessment of some recently documented sites will be proposed. Keywords Symbols; sanctuaries, Upper Palaeolithic; south-west Europe; hunter-gatherers; Palaeolithic structures. Introduction The question mark in the title of this paper is intended to emphasize that serious research on the rites performed during the Upper Palaeolithic has seldom been carried out.1 This may appear paradoxical, since most researchers of this period would agree that ritual activity played an important role within the hunter-gatherer societies of the last glacial era. Despite this, specific study of this complex aspect of human behaviour has rarely been tackled in its full complexity. It is true that references are often made to features of the archaeological record that are considered anomalous and attributed to indeterminate rites. However, these contexts are rarely analysed in detail, and the criteria enabling this supposed ritual activity to be identified, or the methods that would allow us interpret it, have not been discussed explicitly. In contrast to more recent prehistoric periods, we do Routledge World Archaeology Vol. 41(2): 262-294 The Archaeology ofCaves, Shelters and the Deep Karst ' Tayior&amp;Frandscroup © 2()09 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/ 1470- 1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438240902843964</page><page sequence="2">Rites in the dark? 263 not possess a well-developed theory for non-funerary rituals among hunter-gatherers, or sufficient rigorous studies of the archaeological information. Yet the excellent archaeological documentation that exists in general for the Palaeolithic offers numerous possibilities. This paper will discuss the interpretation of sites in the interior of caves used in the Magdalenian in south-west Europe, with possible signs of the development of ritual activities or the construction of structures that could be linked to rites. First, however, we will examine briefly a difficult theoretical and methodological problem: what is understood by ritual? How can it be recognized in the archaeological record? In what ways can we interpret this aspect of the reality of the past? The residues of ritual: an archaeological perspective One of the main problems that studies of ritual come up against is the definition of the field of study. Ritual is a concept that archaeology has borrowed from the neighbouring discipline of anthropology. This is easy to understand, since rites are related to the realm of action (Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994), and this cannot be directly observed by archaeologists. Moreover, rites have a deep relationship with symbolic behaviour, as was stated by Geertz in his classic - if debatable - definition of ritual as the performance of a system of symbols (Geertz 1973). Notwithstanding the concern of recent archaeology with the role of symbols in social life, it is hard to deny that this is a kind of material that our discipline handles with great difficulty. It is not an easy task for the anthropologist either. Since the 1970s, several scholars have challenged the pertinence ofthat concept, clearly related to Emile Durkheim's influential approach to primitive religion. For him ritual was the active part of religion, and thus distinguished from conceptual aspects, such as beliefs, symbols and myths (Durkheim 1912). This notion of ritual was clearly related to Durkheim's dichotomy between sacred and profane. Ritual was conceived as the active part of the sacred, opposed to magic and other kinds of actions with a practical or even profane aim. However, the difficulty, or even the impossibility, of applying the distinction between sacred and profane to many societies has long been highlighted (cf. Evans- Pritchard 1937, 1965; Mauss 1936). It has frequently been argued that this perspective is typical of post-Enlightenment Western thinking, and that most societies do not distinguish between these realms.2 Thus, we would be facing a clear case of a phenomenon which has significance from an etic perspective, but with no sense from an ernie point of view in many societies. Therefore, the question is whether it is useful as an analytical instrument or not. Goody (1977) in his re-analysis of the issue concluded that the term ritual has done little but confuse the attempt to understand human behaviour, and suggests its retirement as too vague and imprecise. In his opinion, sociology and anthropology should follow the example of other disciplines, such as psychology, which are questioning the use of supposed basic concepts, such as intelligence. Similar conclusions are reached by Humphrey and Laidlaw (1994), who are sceptical about the possibility that a 'useful theory of the whole range of such phenomena is possible, and that the term "ritual" does not pick out a class of events or institutions in an analytically useful way (although it remains useful as an informal descriptive term)'.</page><page sequence="3">264 Pablo Arias Paradoxically, despite the critiques mentioned above, the use of the term ritual has spread considerably in recent years. This may be influenced, as Catherine Bell (1992) highlights, by its apparently more neutral character than other traditional terms, such as the couple liturgy/magic (which would hide the distinction of Our' rites in contrast with those of Others'). Nonetheless, a semantic widening has taken place, from the realm of religion, to refer to a large series of social acts of a 'secular' character (Segalen 1998). 3 A specific field of research called 'ritual studies' has even been proposed (Grimes 1982). This result appears to confirm Goody's view of over twenty-five years ago: ritual has become too general and all-embracing a term to be really useful for the understanding of human behaviour and culture. Should we abandon the concept? Not necessarily. Some anthropologists have proposed a change of perspective to give greater significance to the point of view of the actors. The fundamental element of this new approach would be the notion of 'ritualization'.4 From this viewpoint, the analysis of rites as 'independently existing objects' would lose meaning, and ritual would be defined by the attitude with which the participant approached the action (Bell 1992, 1997; Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994). In archaeology, interest in ritual has increased significantly since the 1980s. This has been shown by certain bibliometrical studies showing that our discipline reproduces, some years later, the trends existing in anthropology (Bradley 2005; Rakita and Buikstra 2008). However, this has not gone hand in hand with a significant examination of the numerous methodological problems posed by the recognition and study of ritual from the material remains to which archaeologists have access. Although some important papers have been published tackling this topic (e.g. Barraclough and Malone 2007; Chapman 2001; Renfrew 1985, 1994), the actual practice in archaeology rarely goes beyond the rough approach of classifying as ritual anything odd or otherwise not understood, as has been pointed out in recent years by scholars such as Démoule (2001), Insoll (2004: 1-2), Richards and Thomas (1984) or, more playfully, Bahn (1989: 62). Ritual would be, like its companion religion, that which displays 'concerns which appear to go beyond the material realm' (Leroi-Gourhan 1986: 5): an approach that, as we have seen, can hardly be applied to the pre-industrial societies that archaeologists usually study or even to religion in general (Feldtkeller 2006). In addition, this point of view usually contributes little to understanding the societies that we are studying. In general, the conception of ritual as an ideological manifestation of a non- practical or irrational nature usually leads to the end of the investigation when we class the phenomenon as 'ritual'. It is rarely the starting point for more profound research into ideological or social aspects of the communities being studied. The influence of Bell's approach can be seen in the work of Bradley (2003, 2004, 2005) and Brück (1999). Both reject the pertinence of distinguishing between practical and ritual realms based on the utilitarian nature of the former and the supposed irrationality of the latter. As these scholars observe, in pre-industrial societies, pragmatic and symbolic aspects are interrelated inextricably, so it is meaningless to attempt to isolate objects, structures or ritual deposits. We are not obliged to classify the archaeological items as either ritual or functional; they can be (and frequently are) both. 'Ritual and domestic life were not two halves of a single phenomenon, to be picked apart by the archaeologist. Instead they formed two layers that seem to have been precisely superimposed' (Bradley 2004: 363-4).</page><page sequence="4">Rites in the dark? 265 According to this point of view, as Brück states, the classical question of how to identify ritual practice in archaeology is irrelevant and stops us tackling a much more important topic: the study of prehistoric rationality. If all the actions of the past make sense within specific coordinates of rationality, their archaeological testimony should allow us to attempt their study. A static and simple definition of ritual is probably meaningless. Rather, we should try a dynamic approach, assuming that it is likely that the social process of ritualization frequently took place in Palaeolithic societies, even in what we would define as normal, practical activities such as hunting, cooking or knapping flint. Rituals were constructed, as Bradley (2005: 119) states, out of the materials of domestic life. Elements taken from everyday activities seem to have been emphasized and acted out in the past. Our task, as archaeologists, is to analyse the material remains of the past in a way that permits us to reveal the ritual aspect of prehistoric activity. And, once we have lost every link with the meaning of the symbols that were acting there, our only resource is contextual analysis. The key would lie not in the 'irrational' character (i.e. foreign to our rationality or incomprehensible to us) of the archaeological evidence, but rather in other factors such as the stereotypical repetition of gestures or activities, their spatial location, the variations between coetaneous communities, etc. Rites in the caves during the Upper Palaeolithic: a review Most Palaeolithic sites are paradigmatic examples of the difficulty in distinguishing the practical and the ritual parts of social activity. Were the decorated slabs at Gönnersdorf just refuse material reused on the floors of living structures or were they deliberately selected for symbolic reasons? Was any ritual activity involved in the location of the structures found during Bosinski's excavation? Or was the very shape of the structures derived from practical reasons alone? Let us remember the Sioux Oglala, who certainly built round-based tents for practical reasons, but also because the circle had a symbolic, mystical meaning in their culture (Geertz 1973). Fortunately, caves give us a unique chance to isolate the ritualized part of human activity. This can be done in the interior, dark part of the caves, because the entrance, the rock-shelter, shares the problems of interpretation of any other hunter-gatherer camp.5 But inside the karst, things were different. Caves are particularly suited to generating a sense of mystery, or even fear, among humans. In fact, throughout history, they have been one of the commonest scenarios for terrifying legends or the dwelling-place of monsters. This virtually universal phenomenon is plausibly related to the darkness that makes this environment hostile to human beings. Many cultures take advantage of the fear of darkness in contexts where profound emotions are required. In our own cultural tradition (at least in Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions) churches are usually poorly lit, and the shade and weak flickering light of candles contribute to creating a suitable atmosphere for the religious experience. The rites themselves use this resource explicitly, as can be seen by examples as diverse as the mysteric cults in Antiquity, the Officium Tenebrae in the Easter liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church or the initiation rites of the Freemasonry. It is reasonable to propose that Palaeolithic groups, who were familiar with the cave entrances where they lived, made use of the opportunity given by the contiguous</page><page sequence="5">266 Pablo Arias underground spaces to carry out social activities related to mystery, such as rites of passage, etc. This has traditionally been the interpretation of some evidence of the activity of Upper Palaeolithic people in the deepest areas of caves. Among these we can mention footprints seen in areas remote from the entrance of several caves, especially in the Pyrenees (Bédeilhac, Gargas, Massat, Labouiche, Tue, Fontanet, Niaux-Réseau Clastres, Montespan) (Bégouën and Valois 1927; Garcia et al. 1990; Pales 1976), but also in other areas, like the recently studied site of Chauvet (Garcia 1999). The case of Tue d'Audoubert is especially relevant, as some of the footprints were too small to belong to adults, and certain peculiarities, such as walking on heels in some places (Plate 1), were interpreted as a sign that initiation rites had been carried out in the cave (see Owens and Hayden 1997 for an interesting reappraisal of this issue).6 Other children also left a testimony of their visits to these frightening places through the stencilled paintings of their hands as preserved in Castillo, Gargas and other caves. A different kind of evidence of the movements of Palaeolithic people inside a cave has recently been observed in La Garma (Arias et al. 2003). Two metres up, above the Magdalenian camp located near the original entrance of the cave, there is a gallery which is difficult to reach, where nothing apart from a number of painted signs has been found. However, a path was worn along the floor of this gallery, consisting of very loose sandy sediment (Plate 2). It seems unlikely that this would have been a deliberate construction; rather, it was probably the result of the frequenting of the gallery by the Palaeolithic Plate 1 Tue d'Audoubert: marks in the clay floor interpreted as children's heel-prints, in the 'Salle des Talons' (from Clottes and Lewis- Williams 1996).</page><page sequence="6">Rites in the dark? 267 Plate 2 La Garma - Lower Gallery: Palaeolithic path. people. It does, however, show that a group of paintings, located in a relatively difficult location, was visited with certain frequency. This is a question about which many conjectures have been made, but for which observable evidence appears to exist in this case. Another characteristic phenomenon in the deep zones of Pyrenean caves is the placing of objects in cracks and fissures in the wall, which has been described for numerous caves with Upper Palaeolithic (usually Magdalenian) occupations or cave art, such as Enlène, Erberua, Bédeilhac, Montespan, Labastide or Gargas (Bégouën and Clottes 1981: 158; Begun et al. 1996; Larribau and Prudhomme 1983: 283-4). On similar lines, we might mention the deliberate breakage of speleothems (Le Portel), sculptures (Enlène, Isturitz) or plaquettes (Isturitz, Labastide, Massât, le Tue d'Audoubert, les Trois-Frères, Le Mas d'Azii, Le Portel, Bédeilhac, Espalungue, Les Espélugues, Lortet, Gourdan, Enlène, La Spugo de Ganties, Roquecourbère, Labouiche, La Vache) (Clottes 1989: 311-13), or the incisions in clay at Tue d'Audoubert. A favourite topic of some pioneers in cave art research was the supposed relationship of the art to rites performed to propitiate successful hunting (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906). The clay figure, probably of a bear, at Montespan or the so-called 'scène de chasse' in the same cave, where a horse engraved in the clay was covered with supposed spear holes, were the most famous cases, but ritual was central to the interpretation of parietal art as a form of sympathetic magic.</page><page sequence="7">268 Pablo Arias The structuralist approach developed by researchers like Laming-Emperaire (1962) and Leroi-Gourhan (1965) abandoned the field of ritual, despite the latter's interest in the study of prehistoric religion. Palaeolithic art remained within the realm of religious behaviour, but there was a shift from ritual to the symbolic meaning of the syntax of the images, i.e. from action to concept. From the notion of isolated ritual acts in certain parts of the cave, the cave itself came to be considered as a 'sanctuary', as a space where the interaction of the morphology of the passages and their walls with the cave's art was endowed with a religious meaning.7 The concept of sanctuary has caught on in cave art research (but see Balbin and Alcolea 1999). Moreover, the existence of 'plaquette sanctuaries' at sites like Enlène or Labastide has been proposed (Simonnet et al. 1984), as these contain large numbers of such portable art objects. However, apart from the abundance of these items and certain considerations about their spatial distribution, no precise definition has been formulated about what this type of ritual space would have involved (see Omnès 1982: 185 for a critique of the application of this term to the documentation at Labastide). An aspect of Leroi-Gourhan's conception that deserves to be explored in greater detail is the notion that the cave itself is a relevant actor in the symbolic contents in which wall art also participates. From this viewpoint, graphic expression is considered only as part of a wider and more complex phenomenon. The profound meaning of an image would not be fully understood in isolation, but through its articulation with the shape of the wall, the play of light and shadows (Groenen 1997), the sounds and the movement of the people taking part in the rites. The cave, from this perspective, becomes, in Leroi-Gourhan's words (1965), a 'caverne participante', not only because its forms are integrated with the graphic expression, but as a theatre, a space which holds and configures the set of relationships of all the aspects involved. Archaeological research should therefore attempt to understand the role these spatial relationships played in the Palaeolithic. Although it may be difficult for archaeologists to apprehend, the acoustic experience should not be secondary in this respect. Auditory sensations (in general like all those related to lower functions of the brain) are closely linked to emotions in our species, a fact which is efficiently exploited by musical expression. Although the 'Archaeology of Sound' (Buckley 1998) has scarcely been developed for the Palaeolithic, some attempts have been made to explore the connections between parietal art and the acoustic particularities of caves, as was suggested some time ago by Siegfried Giedion, when he spoke of the 'acoustic space' (1964). Some studies have been made in this respect in certain Pyrenean caves, where the relationship between cave art and the resonance of the passages where it is located has been examined (Reznikoff and Dauvois 1988; Dauvois and Boutillon 1994). At La Garma there might be a relationship between some graphemes, such as a group of five hand stencils (Plate 3) and the deeply disturbing sound of the river in another level of the karst, which can be heard only from the place where those paintings are located (Arias et al. 2003). A case study: ritual areas in the lower and middle Magdalenian of Cantabrian Spain? One of the few examples for the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe where a ritual area has been claimed is the cave of El Juyo, in north Spain. The researchers who studied this site have</page><page sequence="8">Rites in the dark? 269 Plate 3 La Garma - Lower Gallery: hand stencils in Zone IX. proposed a series of criteria for the identification of this type of context, and have compared these with the documentation obtained by their excavations (Freeman and González Echegaray 1981). Although Freeman and González Echegaray's proposal has not provoked the debate that might be desired, the supposed 'sanctuary' at El Juyo has entered the general bibliography on prehistoric religion (Insoll 2004: 55-7), and has been used as an argument to reinterpret certain 'mysterious' contexts that were known previously at Palaeolithic sites in the Pyrenees (Clottes 1989). El Juyo is not an isolated case, however. As Soledad Corchón noted some time ago (Corchón 1990), a series of remains from the early phases of the Magdalenian in north Spain and the Pyrenees are known, which, despite being in general quite vague, have been interpreted, explicitly or implicitly, as evidence of ritual areas (Fig. 1). We shall examine the available documentation in detail below. The sites are listed in chronological order, except for the first one, the cave that opened the debate, El Juyo. El Juyo (Camargo, Cantabria) The structures interpreted as a ritual area (Fig. 2) were located in the part of the excavated area which was furthest from the entrance of the cave. There, Freeman and González Echegaray (1981) observed a very complex series of features. According to their interpretation of the building process, the first phase of the sanctuary began with a rearrangement of the blocks on the surface of the cave to make a roughly triangular hollow space where a trench was dug out. This was filled with a succession of layers of</page><page sequence="9">270 Pablo Arias Figure 1 Location of the main sites discussed in the text. sand and archaeological materials, the latter interpreted as an offering. This included limpets {Patella sp.), periwinkles (Littorina littorea) and colouring matter, red deer {Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) leg and jaw bones (in some cases they were in anatomical connection, suggesting they were deposited with flesh), and a red deer antler tine in a vertical position. Once the trench was filled, an earthen mound was built up, formed by a succession of layers of offerings (similar to those in the trench) and a very peculiar filling, consisting of an ordered arrangement of cylindrical pieces of sediment in bright colours (red, yellow and green), making a flower-like pattern. All this was encased in a clay shell, reinforced by stone slabs, and a*op it 'several intact bone spearpoints' were found. The whole structure was covered by a huge limestone slab, weighing about 900kg, supported by large flat stones. Structure 2, forming a right angle with the preceding, was similar to structure 1, but smaller. It also consisted of a trench filled with an alternation of black layers rich in charcoal and organic matter with cylinders of coloured earth, in this case laid out in a double line. Around the structure, a stone and clay wall was observed, with several stones in a near-vertical position. In the north-eastern corner of structure 2, the excavators found a narrow hole filled with greasy black earth, interpreted by them as a channel connecting it with the former mound. Around both structures, several small circular pits (20-40cm in diameter; 30cm deep) were found, containing pieces of ochre, shells of Patella and Littorina littorea and 'a substantial number of eyed bone needles, several of which were complete in striking contrast' with the rest of the layer (Freeman and González Echegaray 1981: 10). Some of the needles were placed vertically. It has also been reported that inside one of those pits a sculpture representing a hind was found. It was made from a rib, using a technique similar to the classical bone cut-outs {contours découpés) of the Pyrenean middle Magdalenian (Freeman and González Echegaray 1982: 164).</page><page sequence="10">Rites in the dark? 271 I Limite " del nivel I I Limite del nivel escala ^S&gt;sjì3D **"^ Rampa EL JUYO NIVEL 4 1979 Figure 2 El Juyo, level 4: Magdalenian structure (from Freeman and González Echegaray 1981). The presence of a large rectangular stone slab (90 χ 60 χ 12cm) is also noteworthy. It stood vertically north west of structure 1 and north of structure 2. However, the most outstanding feature was a large block (35 χ 32 χ 21cm) of limestone and sandstone8 (Fig. 3) found in the middle of the south-eastern side of structure 2, facing in. The</page><page sequence="11">272 Pablo Arias Figure 3 El Juyo, level 4: limestone and sandstone block interpreted as the representation of a head (from González Echegaray and Freeman 1981). excavators read a series of natural features and human modifications of that block as the deliberate representation of a head, with a half human, half feline face (González Echegaray and Freeman 1981). A second phase in the development of the sanctuary involved the construction of a new mound, 30cm thick, covering the large horizontal slab in structure 2. Two circular pits, similar to the preceding, and a wall, built with three layers of flat stones in a clay mortar, and a rectangular platform with two hearths, later covered with a layer of small stones, complete the features of this supposed sanctuary. In discussing the significance of this complex set of structures, Freeman and González Echegaray (1981: 4) propose a number of criteria to identify ritual areas in the archaeological record. On the basis of Spiro's definition of ritual as 'culturally patterned symbolic behaviour by which the human community (or agents thereof) attempt to influence culturally postulated superhuman beings' (Spiro 1966: 96-7), they suggest that: • symbolic behaviour should be reflected in evidence not related to common subsistence or 'normal' activities; • the communal nature of ritual should be detected by an indication that several persons participated in the performance; • its relation with supernatural beings should be shown by their graphical representation. They argue that the structures of layer 4 fit those criteria perfectly. There was a selection in the faunal and industrial material: the anatomical parts represented in that area (only</page><page sequence="12">Rites in the dark? 273 bones from jaws, ribs and feet of Cervus elaphus and Capreolus capreolus) are different from the rest of layer 4 (though they do not give a detailed account of the raw data). Moreover, the industrial record of this area includes an abnormal concentration of antler or bone spear points and needles, and also a larger amount of several mineral materials (large lumps of red ochre and white clay) than usual. It also appears evident that the structures themselves are difficult to understand in the context of Ordinary domestic activities' (Freeman and González Echegaray 1981: 14), because of both their shape and the way they were built. The participation of several individuals is inferred from the size of the whole structure and the weight of the two large slabs. They calculate (without justifying the figure) that at least ten to fifteen people were involved in the building of the structure. Moreover, they consider that the whole structure would have been intended to cause a visual impact on people entering the cave. The third criterion, the relationship with supernatural creatures, would be fulfilled by the rock interpreted as a sculpture representing a mixed human-animal being. Freeman and González Echegaray (1981) conclude that the structure at El Juyo might be considered the archaeological evidence of a Palaeolithic sanctuary. They even go further and try to explore the activities taking place there and their significance. Using comparative material from ethnography and history of religions they propose that El Juyo might be related to initiation rites of male adolescents. They argue that this kind of activity frequently includes the presence of opposed principles and the inclusion of wild beasts among the symbols, traits that they have found (or interpreted) at El Juyo. Erralla (Cestona, Basque Country) Another lower Magdalenian context in Cantabrian Spain that has been interpreted as a ritual area is Level V at Erralla (Basque Country) (Altuna et al. 1984, 1985). As at El Juyo, the area where the supposed anomalies were detected was the part of the excavated area furthest from the original cave entrance. Two groups of objects were found at the base of the level, directly on the underlying sterile strata, and separated one from the other by some 2m. Both groups included a red deer antler (cut in one case, whole in the other) associated with decorated antler points, remains of antler in the early stages of being processed, bones of ibex {Capra pyrenaica), chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), the shells of limpets (Patella vulgata) and periwinkles (Littorina littored) and large calcite crystals. As can be seen in the published photographs, one of the groups was covered by stone slabs that, although they did not form a continuous pavement, clearly individualized the subjacent area, whose boundaries were also marked by two slabs placed upright. The other group did not display a similar feature, although, according to the excavators, that function could have been played by an overhang on the wall under which the mentioned objects were situated. The excavators explicitly propose an interpretation as a ritual area for this part of the cave, based on a series of traits they considered relevant. First, according to their interpretation, the structure of the two groups was identical: in both cases the central element was a deer antler, with which the same categories of objects were associated. They also emphasize the absence of lithic implements (in reality, a low density) and the presence</page><page sequence="13">274 Pablo Arias of unusual elements (calcite crystals, the only ones found in the level). They also consider the cover of stone slabs in the case of the first deposit as significant. The whole is interpreted as an offering related to the primordial activity of Magdalenian subsistence: hunting. This is inferred from the presence of antler points, together with various elements of the chaîne opératoire leading to their manufacture, the unworked raw material and several intermediate phases. In parallel they highlight the symbolic value of red deer antler in many cultures and its frequent link with fertility and rejuvenation, probably suggested by its annual renewal. Entrefoces (Morcín, Asturias) Unlike the other cases being discussed, Entrefoces is not a cave site, but a rock-shelter. During González Morales' excavations at the site, a quartzite cobblestone was recovered that had been sculpted into the shape of a human head, and apparently placed upright between three limestone boulders, defined by the excavator as a 'structure', next to a niche in the wall of the shelter. It was associated with two brightly coloured cobblestones (red and yellow in colour) and an 'anomalous pile of magnificent pyramidal cores', two burins, a backed bladelet and other knapping waste. Unfortunately, the surface where this group of objects was found was too small for its meaning to be determined more precisely. However, the excavator remarked that the proximity of the deposit of cores, boulders and cobblestones to the sculpture 'suggested there could be a possibly significant association' (González Morales 1990: 34). Fraile Ait ζ Ι (Deba, Basque Country) The evidence in this cave was found in an interior chamber, separated from the vestibule by a short passage. There, on a surface formed by a cobblestone floor (Plate 4), a collection of fourteen stone pendants was recovered. These were unusual in form (large and decorated) and apparently distributed at very similar distances one from another (between 7 and 25cm). The researchers state that the peculiar shape of some of these pendants may represent the human figure in a schematic way. It is particularly striking that practically no other industrial remains were found in the chamber apart from the pendants. The site of Praile Aitz is still being studied, and therefore no definitive conclusions have yet been published. Although a ritual function was proposed in an early publication (Peñalver and Mujika 2005: 150), more recent studies have been more cautious in the interpretation. In any case, the authors note the exceptionality of the context, highlighting the absence of the characteristic traits of a settlement and the apparent brevity of the use of this space (Peñalver and Mujika 2007-8: 226). La Garma (Ribamontan al Monte, Cantabria) La Garma is the name of a hill where twelve different archaeological sites have been discovered, providing an almost continuous sequence of occupations between the lower Palaeolithic and the Middle Ages. The Lower Gallery, a level in the karst where the cave</page><page sequence="14">Rites in the dark? 275 Plate 4 Praile Aitz I: Magdalenian floor with perforated cobbles (from Peñalver and Mujika 2007-8). entrance became blocked at the end of the Pleistocene, has conserved an important assemblage of Palaeolithic cave art and an exceptional sample of the last occupational phase of the cave, in the middle Magdalenian (Arias et al. in press). It is possible to observe directly, with no need to excavate, a surface area of about 800m2 of an extraordinarily rich deposit, including several stone stfuctures (Ontañón 2003). The evidence that we are going to discuss here is located in Zone IV, a sector of the Lower Gallery some 1 30m from the entrance of the cave that was used by Palaeolithic groups. The Magdalenian remains are concentrated in an area with a low ceiling, which drops from 1.7m to 0.5m. There, archaeological objects (mainly mammal bones, but also lithics, shells, charcoal, red ochre and portable art items) are distributed over an area of about 55m2. Three stone structures are found next to the western wall of the chamber. Two of them (adjacent structures IV-A and IV-B) (Plate 5; Fig. 4) are roughly oblong areas demarcated by speleothems, where IV-B is much larger than IV-A (3.18m2 compared with 1.5m2), whereas IV-C (5.35m2), located 1.4m to the north east of IV-B, was built by digging out the stones (mostly fragments of speleothem) from the floor and piling them up around its edges to form two small dry-stone walls, as well as by placing large slabs vertically (Plate 6). Although the documentation of the archaeological materials in Zone IV is not finished yet, a substantial part of its surface (67 per cent) has already been analysed. The provisional results (see Arias et al. in press) show several unusual features for a middle</page><page sequence="15">276 Pablo Arias Figure 4 La Garma - Lower Gallery: distribution of archaeological items in the western part of the Zone IV. Magdalenian site. The distribution of archaeological items (Fig. 4) is strongly biased towards faunal remains. Bones from ungulates are by far the most frequent remains (2419 items, resulting in a density of 64.39 per square metre). Remains of horse {Equus caballus) dominate the assemblage, amounting to approximately 61 per cent of the material recorded (and 70 per cent of the material corresponding to consumed mammals), whereas at any other Cantabrian site red deer (Cervus elaphus) or ibex (Capra pyrenaica) are usually the dominant species, and always clearly outnumber horse. In fact, ibex is totally absent in Zone IV. Moreover, some unusual features have been recorded, such as the presence inside structure IV-B of the skull of an equid whose dome had been removed. We must also highlight the presence of bones of cave lion (Panthera (Leo) spelaea) with evidence of human transformation during the Magdalenian. In a limited area at the southern end of structure IV-C, two nearly complete skeletons of shelduck (Tadorna tadorna L.) whose bones do not present butchery marks or burnt surfaces, suggest that the birds were left as whole bodies on the cave floor. In contrast with the large human impact on the cave's interior, especially regarding the abundant faunal material, the scarcity of the lithic assemblage is quite striking: so far, only 349 lithic artefacts have been recorded, fewer than nine objects per square metre. The bone and antler industry density is also very low compared with other Magdalenian sites. Other outstanding traits are the high indices of objects of adornment (most of them perforated marine mollusc shells or teeth) and portable art items (bone or antler</page><page sequence="16">Rites in the dark? 277 Plate 5 La Garma - Lower Gallery: structures IV-A and IV-B. sculptures, engraved bones and engraved slabs of limestone or calcite) (Plate 7). Some evidence suggests that at least some of these were made in that part of the cave: there are two unfinished objects, a partially perforated bear incisor and a bone cut-out (Plate 8), and most of the engraved plaquettes appear to have been made from local calcite slabs. Several engravings have been observed on the ceiling above the southern part of structure IV-B. Magdalenian by their style, these include representations of horses, bison and hinds. In Zone IV (and also in other parts of the Lower Gallery) one form of evidence has been found which is supposed to be linked to ritual activity in the Pyrenees: objects pushed into fissures in the wall. In the case of Zone IV, we can mention a flint flake, placed into a crack in one of the stalagmite columns in the boundary of Structure IV-B (Plate 9). It is important to stress that, at La Garma, a key issue for the interpretation of this kind of archaeological evidence has been addressed: the temporal depth of the archaeological</page><page sequence="17">278 Pablo Arias Plate 6 La Garma - Lower Gallery: structure IV-C. record. Do these objects and structures correspond to a short period of human activity or do they, on the contrary, represent a palimpsest of repeated episodes that may have taken place over several millennia? Current evidence suggests that in this case the former possibility is the correct answer. On the one hand, both the radiocarbon dates (see below) and the industrial assemblages are very homogeneous. On the other, the stratigraphie evidence is also consistent with a short period of use of the area. As we have detailed elsewhere (Arias et al. in press), the Magdalenian floors that can be currently observed at Zone IV appear to correspond to a very thin layer of archaeological objects deposited over fragments of speleothem, rather than to the surface of a 'normal' thicker stratigraphie deposit. Although we must always be aware that strict contemporaneity at the scale of a human lifetime can seldom be demonstrated through archaeological methods, in this case the evidence is fairly consistent with the hypothesis of a quite short occupation. Zone IV is still under study. However, some provisional observations can be noted. The current archaeological evidence is incompatible with the interpretation of this zone as a living area, since there is a noticeable absence of such typical features of a Magdalenian hunter-gatherers' camp as hearths or the accumulation of large amounts of flint debris. To this must be added the unfavourable living conditions in this zone, with its low roof and large distance from the entrance. The latter feature is not fully incompatible with everyday</page><page sequence="18">Rites in the dark? 279 Plate 7 La Garma - Lower Gallery: calcite slab with an engraving representing a mixed being. activities (good examples are known in the Magdalenian of the Pyrenees, at sites like Enlène and Tue d'Audoubert), but it is not common. Furthermore, the atypical nature of the faunal assemblage should be emphasized, with its unusual composition of species for the region (predominance of horses) and such rare evid&amp;ice as the opened equid skull in structure IV-B or the two complete specimens of shelduck in IV-C. Moreover, it appears that activities that have taken place here include the manufacture of elements of adornment and decorated objects, as is suggested by the presence of half fabricates (the pendant made from a bear's tooth or the bone cut-out) and the fact that the slabs used for the engraved plaquettes were probably obtained inside the cave. Las Caldas (Oviedo, Asturias) To conclude, we must cite another key lower-middle Magdalenian site in the region: Las Caldas in central Asturias. This cave has provided a long, complex Solutrean and Magdalenian stratigraphy. Although Soledad Corchon's excavations have produced plentiful literature, the large amount of archaeological documentation obtained in the course of the fieldwork is still being studied. This particularly affects the context we have to refer to, of which only a few brief references have been published (Corchón 1992: 36, 43^, 1994: 249). In the furthest part from the cave entrance, at the end of Chamber II,</page><page sequence="19">280 Pablo Arias Plate 8 La Garma - Lower Gallery: unfinished bone cut-out representing an ibex head. a very peculiar deposit was observed at the base of the middle Magdalenian (Level IXc), directly above a thick bed of sterile silt. Taphonomic studies carried out by Corchón's team were able to infer that, when the material* in question was deposited, this part of the cave was flooded, as suggested by the unusual patina seen on the surface of the bones (Corchón 1995: 48). In comparison with other middle Magdalenian sectors in the cave, the assemblage we are referring to was characterized by the presence of a small number of quite unusual and well-preserved objects: horse and deer hemi-mandibles, an auroch's horn, bear teeth, numerous large flint cores, some of which had hardly been used, very few implements of great technical quality, manufactured on blades (scrapers, burins, retouched blades, thick retouched laminar flakes), some bifaces, a cleaver with double patina (evidence of re-knapping), perforated equid incisors with angular motifs and series of lines, and engraved sandstone plaquettes, which in some cases had been burnt. These represented steppe-type animals (reindeer, mammoth, rhinoceros, equids) and numerous anthro- pomorphs. Corchón emphasizes that there were hardly any of the most common elements in Palaeolithic assemblages, such as knapping waste, lithic or bone implements, or bone splinters. The singularity of the objects that were found and their location in a flooded part of the cave led Corchón to interpret this ensemble as being the result of the intentional deposit of</page><page sequence="20">Rites in the dark? 281 Plate 9 La Garma - Lower Gallery: flint flake stuck in a stalagmitic column. selected items in the water. In her opinion, the ensemble went beyond the boundaries of 'the merely utilitarian or functional' (Corchón 1992: 44), and could be compared with the deposits at Erralla mentioned above and some middle Magdalenian sites in the Pyrenees (e.g. Enlène) with intentional deposits at the base or commencement of the occupation (Corchón 1994). Erberua (Isturitz, Pyrénées- Atlantiques) Erberua is the name with which the Lower Gallery of the Isturitz cave system has been published (Larribau and Prudhomme 1983, 1984, 1989). The access to this cave is extremely difficult as it must be gained by diving through a sump. Its walls contain a large ensemble of Palaeolithic engravings and paintings, which can be attributed to the Magdalenian according to their stylistic features (Prudhomme 1992). At least four small stone circular structures have been identified in an area that was in total darkness during the Palaeolithic.9 One of these (C or β) had a horse's tooth inside it and there were ribs in the other (or others - it is not made clear in the publications). Some bone and flint remains were found in the proximity of these, apparently in quite low densities. The publications also highlight the presence of numerous bone splinters stuck into the walls. It is interesting to note that not a single piece of charcoal was found inside these small constructions, so their interpretation as hearths does not appear probable, although the researchers who studied the cave discuss this possibility (Larribau and Prudhomme 1989).</page><page sequence="21">282 Pablo Arias No detailed study of the surface finds in this cave has been published to date, so not even their chronology is known for certain. However, the difficult access and internal coherence of the rock art ensemble suggests a provisional dating in the Magdalenian, perhaps the middle Magdalenian, which is well represented in the sequence in the Upper Gallery, Isturitz Cave itself. Discussion The evidence described in the previous pages is located in a limited segment of the Upper Palaeolithic chrono-stratigraphic sequence of Cantabrian Spain: the lower and middle Magdalenian. Moreover, some of the lower Magdalenian contexts belong to the end of that period (such as Level 4 at El Juyo), while the two levels classified as middle Magdalenian (La Garma and Las Caldas) are dated to the early phase of the period, during a very cold episode (probably the Heinrich I event) (Corchón 2007-8). The available radiocarbon determinations (Table 1) confirm this attribution. So far, fifteen dates have been published, related directly or indirectly to the structures described in the previous section. The determinations from Erralla, La Garma and Las Caldas were obtained from samples taken from the structures themselves, so they should date their construction or use. They are short-lived samples (bones and charcoal from a plant with a short life) and so relatively reliable. The age of Zone IV at La Garma is particularly solid, as seven absolute determinations have been made for various kinds of material (bones of different mammals and birds, Juniperus charcoal), and they are reasonably coherent, although one of them (AA-45584) is too imprecise to be of real use. At the other sites, the determinations were obtained from samples taken from other parts of the strata containing the structures. Given the imprecision of Palaeolithic dates, which are always situated within a range of several centuries, this relative inaccuracy is no significant concern. All the dates are coherent with the chrono-stratigraphic periodization, and, where they come from a deposit with several dated occupation levels, they are coherent with the relative chronology of the site (El Juyo and Las Caldas). The structures we have been studying are therefore included within a quite short time bracket of the Cantabrian Palaeolithic: they are all contexts dated between 17,500 and 14,000 cal. BC, although the more complex cases (El Juyo, La Garma and Las Caldas) are situated in a much more restricted chronological segment (the fifteenth millennium cal. BC). Some features differentiate these contexts from the usual kind of deposit at Upper Palaeolithic sites in south-west Europe. One of the most frequently repeated traits is the location of the structures in the most distant, or at least a marginal, part of the cave in relation to the main occupation areas. At La Garma, Las Caldas, Praile Aitz and possibly Erberua the contexts are located in interior chambers of the respective cave systems, where darkness, spatial constrictions or ponding limited the possible activities of the human groups. At Erralla and El Juyo, the possible evidence of ritual activity is located in the vestibule, where the main camp of the Magdalenian groups was located, but in both cases</page><page sequence="22">Rites in the dark? 283 χ S &lt;υ 1 e o o I cd I I cd OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !ηΌ ^ (ΝΟΟ^^^ΟΟΝ^Ο^^ήΟΟΟ&gt;Λ^ flirté * ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿223 !|§ *^J ï-H i-H l-H 1-H i-Η 1-H ί- Ι i- H i- ^ i- H i-Η »-H i-H i-Η *-H i-^ ^ 1) " C3 S ^ Í ^ ^ "o 2 « "§ OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO u2w - 32¿2¿2222¿¿¿S¿¿2 ï$% m m »λ i- iroooooofOíNmr^oot^-'-H^t ^ ., ΓΛ ill ^ ο -s Ι Ι ^ ΟΟΟΟ ΟΟΟ ΟΟΟ Ua"cö ~ Tt^HOOOOrt^-&lt;«A&gt;W^O^H^HO(N^H 2 ö 'S '« +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 *ο g s s: οοοοοοοο«ηο»η&lt;Ν&lt;&lt;3-οοο « '&gt;» S S fis ill O ö Λ ϋ 2 ¡ S^il^ S2§SS|^ñSSg 111,, Ί « Ss «i-ìi lisa t 1¿3¿! ill I a g g if '111 73 3 J J rP ^ 8 Ë S I Ö Ö Ö fi β β tí β Ö Ö β tì Λ β β C èoJlS PQPQPQPQPQPQUPQPQP3PQPQUPQPQPQ S Eoffl *c3 ή (Ν 'Ι 11 ¡.¡ι? -o S e s 5 Γ* &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HHI-HhHHHt-Hh-HI-H)-H ásío^ Γ* HHI-HhHHHt-Hh-HI-H)-H « d U ^) R títíOtítítíOO « .22 2 J3 ΐ « g υ h-H H- I HH HH g .5 ü 3 •S tí g g g S Ö^ tö cö ci cd rt cö cd cd cd 5=2^«</page><page sequence="23">284 Pablo Arias in the furthest part from the cave entrance. Only at Entrefoces was no peculiarity of this kind noted, apart from the possible structure associated with a niche in the wall. A second, systematically repeated trait is that the anomalous structures or ensembles were deposited when the cave (or at least that part of the cave) was being occupied for the first time or when it was re-occupied after a long period of abandonment. In most cases (the only exception is Entrefoces) the structures were located directly on top of thick sterile layers. This feature, which also occurs at some sites in the Pyrenees, as we shall see below, has sometimes been linked to possible foundational rites (Clottes 1989; Corchón 1994). However, this hypothesis is relatively inconsistent with another very peculiar characteristic of these structures. Evidence has been found suggesting that most of them were used during a short period (in the time scale of a person, not in the longer 'archaeological time').10 This fact should help the analysis of the activities carried out in these places by the human groups. In theory, as they were occupied for a shorter time, it should be easier to infer the actions that produced the available archaeological record than if this was the result of the accumulation of many remains over a longer period. Equally, it is less likely that the purpose of the structures would have varied than if they had been in use for a prolonged time. The most visible feature of this group of sites we are analysing is possibly the deliberate construction of stone structures (walls, pavements). The exception seems to have been Level IXc at Las Caldas, where the preliminary reports that have been published make no mention of their existence. In general, it seems that material obtained in the cave itself was used to build them. The only exception to this is one of the stones at El Juyo (the so-called 'mask', which formed part of one of the walls) which was almost certainly brought from outside the cave. However, if the interpretation of this object as a kind of sculpture is accepted, it may have been selected deliberately. In the two most complex cases (El Juyo and La Garma), these constructions were complemented by the excavation of ditches or large pits. Possibly these were dug partly to obtain the stone. One of the most striking elements of the structures is the use of upright stones, noted at El Juyo, La Garma and Erralla, although at Erralla the stones were smaller. On most occasions, it could be that this was a relatively simple alternative for raising high walls, which is not easy in the case of dry-stone walls using the irregular limestone boulders available to the improvised Magdalenian masons. In other cases, however, such as at El Juyo, where a large flat stone was found standing outside the stone constructions, the functional explanation does not seem to apply. The contents of these areas also display apparently significant regularities. At Erralla, Praile Aitz, La Garma and Las Caldas certain types of archaeological materials that are usually associated with everyday activities, such as lithic implements or hearths, are scarce. At La Garma, for example, the density of lithic implements reaches only 8.75 items/m3, with significant variation between different structures (Arias et al. in press), whereas at Erralla the figure is even smaller (0.54 items/m3, according to our estimates).11 Faunal assemblages also show unusual species composition and anatomical part representation. An intriguing issue is the role of the horse. This species is overrepresented at La Garma, and the location of rare parts such as skulls or hemi-mandibles has also been reported at the same site and at Las Caldas. Bahn (1982; see also Bahn in press) drew attention to the apparently intentional deposit of a horse's tooth inside one of the</page><page sequence="24">Rites in the dark? 285 structures at Erberua and related it to other evidence for symbolic meaning of this species in the Pyrenean Magdalenian at Labastide and Duruthy (see below), and in the portable art of that period. A very recurrent element is the presence and sometimes high density of portable art or adornment objects (particularly at Las Caldas, La Garma and Praile Aitz), and it has even been shown that some objects were manufactured in situ (Alvarez 2006). At all the sites except Erralla the graphic representations include anthropomorphs and mixed beings with some human features. Less systematic is the presence of anomalous concentrations of red pigment, observed only at El Juyo and La Garma. The spatial association of structures with examples of cave art datable to the Magdalenian has been noted only at La Garma and Erberua. In other cases, either there is no parietal art in the site or its chronology is indeterminate (Praile Aitz) or clearly distant from the structure (such as at Entrefoces, where engravings of an older chronology decorate a niche in the wall some distance from the structure). This negative fact could be significant because, as we have already shown (Arias and Ontañón 2004), during the middle Magdalenian in Cantabrian Spain a significant association exists between the densities of portable art and parietal art. Table 2 shows the distribution of the traits mentioned above across the different sites. Entrefoces is clearly different, and should not be considered to form part of this particular ensemble of sites. In the case of Erberua, the available information is insufficient (especially since the chronology of the site is not well established), but it might be worth considering the possibility of including it in the group.

In Cantabrian Spain, hundreds of Palaeolithic sites have been recorded, particularly Upper Palaeolithic, and many of them have been excavated in detail, but ensembles like these have not been observed for any other period.12 Neither can it be explained by sampling problems. Although the lower Magdalenian is a well-represented period in the Cantabrian archaeological record, the middle Magdalenian is less so. In any case, the total number of sites of both periods does not amount to a quarter of all the Upper Palaeolithic sites that have been studied in the region.13 Is this phenomenon is characteristic of Cantabrian Spain or of a more general trend? Links have been suggested between the contexts being studied in this paper and analogous cases at middle Magdalenian sites in the Pyrenees, a region displaying notable points of contact with Cantabrian Spain during the period. However, the available evidence is not conclusive, even in the clearest cases, the caves of Enlène, le Mas d'Azii and, more doubtfully, Fontanet, Labastide and the rock-shelter of Duruthy. In the Salle du Fond of Enlène, Bégouën and Clottes observed an apparently deliberate deposit consisting of a sandstone plaquette and about forty bone splinters or antler-point fragments driven into the clay floor, corresponding to the first Magdalenian occupation of the cave (Bégouën et al. 1996; Clottes 1989: 309-10). Similarly, in the Galerie des Silex in the cave of Mas d'Azii, M. and S. J. Péquart noted a clear division in the archaeological contents of the area. In one part of the passage they located a conventional Magdalenian deposit, while in the other area they found only a large hearth, associated with a side passage containing rock art. This was interpreted by the above-mentioned researchers as a deliberate structuring of the passage, differentiating a habitation area and a sacred zone (Péquart and Péquart 1963). At Fontanet a reindeer antler had been driven into a kind of stalagmite surface, 2.5m above the floor level, covered with clay, in which a group of eleven incisions was made (Clottes 1989). Inside the cave of Labastide, 400m from the entrance, some Magdalenian hearths dated to 14260 ± 440 BP (Ly-1405) were found containing horse's teeth and mandibles with some tools and engravings (Omnès 1982). In the rock-shelter of Duruthy the horse appears to have been furnished with a deep symbolic significance. At this dense Magdalenian settlement, three sculptures representing this animal were found. One of them, a large representation of a kneeling horse, was lying against two skulls and some fragments of jaws of the same species. Two of them were defining something like a box containing two pendants made from wolf premolars and a knife. The excavator suggests that this may have been a sanctuary where horse played an important role (Arambourou 1978).14 With the available data, it appears difficult to propose an analogy between the Pyrenean and Cantabrian contexts. The clearest element they have in common is the location in deep areas of the caves, a relatively frequent trait in the Pyrenees. However, these signs of activity in the interior of the caves are different from the cases described in this study. The existence of quite complex structures in the interior parts of caves, with a series of peculiar features in their archaeological contents, appears to be specific to the late lower Magdalenian and the early middle Magdalenian in the Cantabrian region, perhaps extending to the western end of the Pyrenees.</page><page sequence="26">Rites in the dark? 287 However, the fundamental question is their meaning. Are these ritual areas? Or, rather, formulating the question from the methodological perspective proposed above: are there signs of ritualization in the activities carried out in these areas? The available documentation is still very incomplete. At two of the contexts being studied the fieldwork has not yet finished (La Garma and Praile Aitz), for another two the final report is still pending publication (El Juyo and Las Caldas) and at the most complete (Erralla) the report does not provide sufficiently detailed information to be able to assess this question. At the moment, no detailed comparison between the supposedly ritual areas and the rest of the coetaneous context can be made. Nonetheless, evidence can be noted which suggests that the activities carried out in these areas may have been performed in a social context of ritualization. Suggestive are: their location in specific areas, characterized by the dark and distance from other areas where more undifferentiated types of activities took place; the repetition of certain traits in the constructions; the existence of certain regularities in the archaeological contents of the assemblages; and the space-time limitation in which they occur. Obviously, this does not imply that the same types of activities were carried out at the six caves or that these shared the same meaning.15 However, it is worth proposing the hypothesis that groups who occupied the Cantabrian region during the fifteenth millennium cal. BC carried out ritual activities in the interior of caves. Testing this hypothesis requires the development of a specific research programme which would include a detailed reappraisal of the archaeological contents of the contexts involved, and their comparison with other coetaneous contexts, at the same sites where the supposed ritual areas are located and also at other Magdalenian sites, including both settlements (in caves and in the open) and evidence of activity inside the caves that appears not to have been related to rites (see, for instance, Balbin et al. 2003). Only then will we be in a position to make a serious proposal about the meaning of these atypical areas. Final remarks In this paper we have shown that the study of ritual is a much more complex problem than is usually admitted in archaeology. The existence of something 'strange' or inexplicable is not enough to propose the existence of religious activity. It is likely that ritual played a significant role in the life of Upper Palaeolithic groups, but equally that it would have been inextricably intertwined with other aspects of social life, perhaps through the ritualization of everyday activities. Hence, its study requires a serious debate, in archaeology in general and in the study of hunter-gatherers in particular, about the social meaning of ritual and the methodology for its study. We have tried to show that cave interiors provide an isolated environment, particularly suitable for delimiting many of the practical problems arising in the study of ritual among Palaeolithic societies. We have also described a specific example, the ensemble of lower and middle Magdalenian structures in Cantabrian Spain, for which excellent perspectives exist for a profound study of this aspect of social activity. Only through the conjunction of high-quality empirical documentation and the correct methodological approaches will it be possible to make significant progress in the research of such a complex topic.</page><page sequence="27">288 Pablo Arias Acknowledgements This paper has benefited from the comments of my colleagues Angel Armendariz, Paul Bahn, Rodrigo de Balbín, James W.

International Institute for Prehistoric Research of Cantabria, University of Cantabria pablo.arias@unican.es Notes 1 The study of Palaeolithic burials must be excluded, of course, as it is one of the favourite subjects in Palaeolithic studies of religion and has produced extensive literature. 2 As Jack Goody stated nearly half a century ago, 'it is impossible to escape from the fact that the category of magico-religious acts and beliefs can be defined only by the observer and that attempts to see either this or the sacred-profane dichotomy as a universal nart of the actor's DerceDtion of his situation are misleading' (Ί961: 160Ì. 3 Some authors have criticized this type of approach, and have proposed differentiating these two aspects in the terminology (for example, reserving 'ritual' for religious acts and using the term 'ceremony' for other types of public and coded social activity). However, no general consensus has been reached in this respect. 4 In Catherine Bell's words, ritualization can be described as 'that way of acting that sets itself off from other ways of acting by virtue of the way in which it does what it does. Even more circularly, it can be described as the strategic production of expedient schemes that structure an environment in such a way that the environment appears to be the source of the schemes and their values' (Bell 1992: 140). 5 This paragraph (and the whole paper) should not be understood as a statement that ritual activity was confined inside the caves, or that all the activity in the deeper parts of the karst was ritual. We are aware that a high variability of situations must have existed. We are simply attempting to explore the possibilities offered by a kind of environment where the good preservation of archaeological remains and the low density of human activity make the isolation and analysis of human behaviour (rites included) much more feasible. 6 However, apart from the fact that the Palaeolithic age of these footprints has not always been fully proven (Clottes 1995), it has been pointed out that the initiation rites hypothesis is contradictory with the evidence that the footprints belong to children of different ages, in some cases too small for the option to be a serious proposition. 7 It appears more surprising that recent theses suggesting a relationship between Palaeolithic art and shamanism (Clottes and Lewis- Williams 1996) have focused so much on iconographical arguments, rather than developing systematic research of the evidence for ritual activity that ought to be predicted by that hypothesis. 8 This stone appears to come from an outcrop nearby, in the geological contact between both types of rock.</page><page sequence="28">Rites in the dark? 289 9 We possess precise data for only one of the structures, called Structure C in one publication (Larribau and Prudhomme 1983) and β in another (Larribau and Prudhomme 1984), which was 50cm in diameter. 10 The exception once again is Entrefoces, although in this case the documentation of the site is not contradictory with the others, but simply this characteristic has not been nroven. 11 This figure has been obtained from the surface area given for the supposed ritual contexts by the excavators and from a series of inferences about their stratigraphie thickness obtained from the published report (Altuna et al. 1985). However, to obtain more reliable data would require a reappraisal of the original excavation documenta- tion, as our results contradict the authors' remarks (not quantified in the monograph). Whereas they state, for example, that the structures had hardly any lithic assemblage, from the inventories a similar density to the rest of the level can be inferred (0.04 tools/ m3 and 0.5 knapping remains/m3 for the structures, compared with 0.03 and 0.32 for the rest of the level). The authors have apparently taken into account the surface area of the structures (about 20 per cent of the excavated area), but in view of their little depth, it seems more meaningful to evaluate the density by the excavated volume (only c. 1.4 per cent of the excavated sediment). 12 The case which might display most analogies is Level Via at Llonin with possible structures whose age has not yet been established, although they appear to correspond to the middle Palaeolithic or an early stage of the Upper Palaeolithic. The latest interpretation of this site, still not published in detail, suggests the hypothesis of the deposit of a carnivore reorganized by humans (Fortea et al. 1999). 13 It is not easy to quantify precisely the relative frequency of different periods of Palaeolithic sites. The estimate we give is based on calculations made in an earlier study (Arias and Ontañón 2004), where we proposed a statistical population formed by sites where a minimum of lm3 of sediment had been excavated. Out of this population, the lower Magdalenian would have 16.8 per cent (thirty-one cases out of 185), and the middle Magdalenian only 8.1 per cent. The latter, with fifteen cases, would be the least represented period in the whole of the Upper Palaeolithic. 14 Other examples which have been given as evidence following the publication of the 'Sanctuary' at El Juyo (Clottes 1989), such as the open-air site of Cardonnier, in Auribauil, or the so-called 'cave-temple' of Labouiche, are inconclusive or frankly dubious. 15 From the perspective we are using, the ritualization of a gesture does not necessarily imply a consensus about its meaning. We could state, quoting James W. Fernandez (1965), that the ritual act would have a relatively homogeneous function as 'sign', but not necessarily as 'symbol'.
