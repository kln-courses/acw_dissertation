Copyright (? 1994 Cambridge University Press MELISSA RAPHAEL FEMINISM, CONSTRUCTIVISM AND NUMINOUS EXPERIENCE In Europe and America, Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy remains the most widely known attempt to isolate and distil the essentially religious, perennial and immediate quality of the numinous event in which a person encounters a divine presence. However, since Steven Katz1 made persuasive construc tivist arguments against the possibility of an immediate, ineffable and per ennial religious experience, the validity of any such enterprise must be considered highly questionable. From a feminist point of view, this article will endorse Katz's largely phenomenological argument that 'there is a clear causal connection between the religious and social structure one brings to experience and the nature of one's actual religious experience'. 2 Katzian constructivism questions the possibility that religious experience can have a universal defining essence. In the case of the numinous Otto calls this essence a sui generis numinous 'overplus of meaning' which precedes its various rationalizations in the theologies of the world's religions. But for Katz, experiences of the divine are mediated and organized by conceptual struc tures which help the subject to identify, remember and value the experience as numinous in the first place. Katz is not saying that random beliefs are projected onto random experiences rendering the sensus numinis illusory. Instead, there is a 'two-directional symmetry' in which divine reality and beliefs might be reciprocally related.3 As such, the intentional object of mystical experiences would not encompass one unitary reality in all cases, but remain a (possibly disguised) description 'and carry a meaning relative to some ontological structure'.4 There are significant connections between Katz's argument and the fem inist critique of the systemic effect of patriarchal power. Feminism, using the term patriarchy as an heuristic category, refines Katz's pluralistic point that a mystic (or any religious subject) participates in a whole system of values, images and beliefs which 'define, in advance, what the experience he wants to have, and which he does then have, will be like'.5 In the context of traditional Western monotheism feminism would name these mediating values, images 1 'Language, Epistemology and Mysticism' in S. Katz (ed.), Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis (London: Sheldon Press, I978). Although Katz does not discuss the numinous as such, much of his argument is relevant to the present article since Otto considered that mystical and numinous experience were categorically continuous. 2 Ibid. p. 40.

But this is not to give a neo-essentialist account of religious experience. Postmodern feminism recognizes that patriarchy is historically variable in the context of geography, ethnicity and class. It is a defining characteristic of feminist theory that gender relations are a variant but constituent element of all experience, but that does not mean that all religious experiences in patriarchal societies are essentially the same. Using two of Otto's texts, The Idea of the Holy and the Religious Essays,7 I shall support and supplement Katz's argument with postmodernist feminist theory and with feminist criticism of androcentrism in the history of religions. The choice of these two texts is not random: Otto's concept of holiness - a unique fusion of Lutheran theology, phenomenological research (of sorts) and his own spiritual aesthetic - has been more influential in the history of religions than any other. Van der Leeuw, Eliade and, to some extent, Tillich, have all depended on Otto's account of the numinous as the defining essence of religious consciousness. Throughout The Idea of the Holy Otto repeats that the purely spiritual capacity for numinous emotion 'implies the first application of a category of valuation which has no place in the everyday natural world of ordinary experience'.' The intuition of religious significance is underivable since the holy is immediate on two counts: as a function of an a priori category of mind and as a self-manifestation of the divine.9 In an attempt to protect the religious integrity of the holy, Otto refuses any adulteration or limitation by finite thought. The numinous is precisely the experiential awareness of the divine which eludes comprehension and hence domestication in rational or ethical terms. 'Divination' of the meaning of the numinous appearance is 'the unrestrained recognition and inward acknowledgement that comes from deep within the soul, stirred spontaneously, apart from all conceptual theory'.10 Whilst there is no space here to unravel the idiosyncrasies of Otto's ontological and epistemological scheme, I shall use feminist criticism to provide phenomenological evidence which would suggest that numinous consciousness is not the immediate or 'pure' religious experience that Otto believed it to be. The concepts and language he used to evoke, categorize and value numinous experience reveal that this kind of experience (that is, the combined event in which the numinous object makes itself manifest and 6 Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza 'Introduction' to Bread not Stone: The Challenge of Feminist Biblical Interpretation in S.

There is, therefore, more than a contingent relation between the supposedly transhistorical numinous experience and the historically particular formula set out in The Idea of the Holy for identifying and evoking a numinous experience. This summarizing formula is well known as the feeling of the mysterium tremendum etfascinans. Otto contends that it is through recalling the psychological processes of our 'purest' religious experience that we can begin to delineate its divine object. Anyone who cannot recall a religious experience 'as little as possible qualified by other forms of conscious ness', is 'requested to read no further'.11 Here Otto forcefully rejects the notion that true religious experience has anything to do with its social context. Rather, religion begins with the arousal of numinous awareness in the uncanny feeling that something 'wholly other' (and hence mysterious) is present and which is tremendous in its awe-inspiring power. The 'ideogram' or analogy of majestas unites the tremendum and the fascinosum in a two-fold reaction in which a person is both entranced and horrified by the numen - the as yet un-named deity. By contrast, feminist criticism argues that religious experience is condi tioned from the outset by patriarchal conceptualizations of ultimate value and by sex-role differentiation in the practice of religion. Assuming this constitutive relation between patriarchal ideology and religious experience, I shall suggest that patriarchal ideology provides the primary epistemologi cal and axiological structures that underpin the mysterium tremendum etfasci nans so making numinous experience intelligible and worthy of recall. Ac cordingly, Steven Katz's argument against the existence of any pre-concep tual essence of religious experience can be combined with the feminist argument that androcentrism provides an a priori set of values which has historically conditioned the form and content of religious experience. These combined arguments leave Otto's contention that numinous consciousness was the 'innermost essence' of all religious experience in serious doubt. Moreover, if women's psycho-biological difference (whether natural or con ditioned) and secondary socio-religious status entail that they have different sorts of private religious experience than men, then Otto's argument for an essential sui generis numinous experience is weakened on another count. I do not intend to provide epistemological proofs that numinous experi ence is mediated in and by its cultural context, but, more modestly, to show how feminist criticism strengthens and significantly supplements the construc tivist position. Any epistemological hesitance is inherent in feminist meth odology: 'as a type of postmodern philosophy, feminist theory reveals and contributes to the growing uncertainty within Western intellectual circles about the appropriate grounding and methods for explaining and inter 11 Ibid. p. 8.</page><page sequence="4">514 MELISSA RAPHAEL preting human experience'."2 In claiming that knowledge is socially con stituted, feminist theory cannot therefore stand outside its own embodiment and give absolute epistemological explanations which would suppress the experience of others.13 Instead, 'the fundamental purpose of feminist theory is to analyse how we think, or do not think, or avoid thinking about gender'.14 In the present article, then, feminist theory contributes less a strict refutation of Otto's position than a methodological starting point. It regards the role of gender in religious experience as an issue rather than so neutral a fact about a person's experience of the world that it lies beneath academic notice. It is this methodological point, phenomenologically substantiated, that weakens Otto's case. Yet whilst other disciplines in the humanities acknowledge the centrality of socio-political determinants in the construction of experience and knowledge, religious studies rarely debates constructivism as anything other than a philosophical problem. The feminist critique of androcentrism in the history of religions is exceptional in this respect. Fem inist study of religion raises primary methodological and epistemological questions about the sexual politics of actual, reported and interpreted re ligious experience. Scenting reductionism, religious scholars may be unwill ing to notice or to concede the extent to which feminists claim that sexual politics is constitutive of religious experience. Perhaps this is because a life long acclimatization to the implicit androcentrism 'operative at the deepest levels of Western thought' ensures that 'all scholarly work is affected by it'. 15 Consequently, when historians of religion discuss mystical and numinous experiences though an androcentric lens - as they usually do - they are adding another layer of mediation to the religious experience of the female members of a given religion, which like the society it belongs to, is already generally controlled by men. Otto's own androcentrism led him to assume that a universal numinous experience - what he calls 'an intrinsically religious feeling' - could be essentially unaffected by gender difference. This, despite the fact that the subjects under discussion are usually male and follow male-dominated re ligions. Feminist criticism of religious studies cannot allow that the study of males simply includes the study of women.16 In the words of Rita Gross, 12 Jane Flax, 'Postmodernism and Gender Relations in Feminist Theory' in L. Nicholson (ed.), Feminism/Postmodernism (New York: Routledge, I990), pp. 40-I. 13 It needs to be noted that while the postmodern deconstructive methods are useful, a feminist history of religions would also resist post-modernism in that religious feminism is premised upon an integral female subject who has struggled against socio-religious injustice. Both the struggle for and the quasi eschatological achievement ofjustice form a meta-narrative of the real, painful struggle against patriarchy and all the other alienations that word encompasses. 14 Flax, 'Postmodernism and Gender Relations in Feminist Theory', p. 43. 15 Valerie Saiving, 'Androcentrism in Religious Studies', The Journal of Religion, LVI (I976), I77-97, p.

The question of women's religious and social roles is central to its analysis.'9 I shall conclude by showing how the gynocentrism of contemporary Goddess spirituality similarly constitutes the reports of its own religious experience with a thealogical paradigm shift that has already recovered and celebrated female sacrality through the identification of female creativity with that of the Goddess.20 This new ecological, immanentist paradigm results in a different way of interpreting a divine presence such that a Goddess-worship ping feminist would not want, or expect, and so would not have, a numinous experience of the sort Otto describes in The Idea of the Holy and the Religious Essays.2' This would suggest that conceptual funding is not peculiar to patriarchal religious experience (nor is it necessarily to the detriment of religious experience) but will occur in an androcentric or gynocentric con text. THE SUPRAPATRIARCHAL ELEMENTS OF NUMINOUS EXPERIENCE For the sake of a balanced argument I should like to begin by noting the possibility that numinous experience may be unusually resistant to media tion. Considered on Otto's own terms, there are some distinctive elements of numinous experience which appear to subvert patriarchal authority in re ligious discourse so making any clear a priori ideological conditioning of the experience less certain. Katz's opponents claim that 'there is nothing wrong with Otto's claims about numinous experience transcending on the one hand all language about it, and on the other the concrete religious tradition within which it occurs'. 22 For reasons outlined earlier, religious feminism could not simply accept this statement as it stands. However, Otto's own belief that 17 Ibid. p. io. 18 'Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift', Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion VII (I99I), 75-94, P- 94- 19 Ibid. p. 75. 20 'Thealogy' refers to discourses concerning the Goddess or a female divine principle. 21 It should not be objected that I am not comparing like with like as The Idea of the Holy is far wider in its reference than biblical monotheism. 22 Leon Schlamm, 'Numinous Experience and Religious Language', Religious Studies, XXVIII (I992), 533-5I, p. 534.</page><page sequence="6">5I6 MELISSA RAPHAEL numinous experience is unconditioned and hence a-conceptual might, to some degree preserve the non-rational 'overplus of meaning' in numinous experi ence in as much of an ideological vacuum as patriarchal culture would allow. For this to be so, one would first need to accept Otto's Friesian epistem ology as at least plausible.23 In The Idea of the Holy Otto states (rather than argues) that the numinous is not known through the normal rational conceptual processes of Wissen but through Ahndung: an intuitive capacity to receive the unbidden numinous presence in a pure unmediated impression. These impressions can then only be evoked by analogies drawn from exper iences of structurally similar, but qualitatively other, form and content. If this is true then the patriarchal shaping of numinous experience could be historically contingent and therefore detachable from the original intuition since Ahndung is a non-natural function of the soul which is, by definition, ontologically other and unconditioned by nature or history. Among others,24 Leon Schlamm has recently argued that mystical experience (in which he includes numinous experience) is interpreted by the mystic as being 'uncon ditioned by his tradition' and as having an 'essentially supernatural origin '25 Whilst admitting that 'no experience is entirely unmediated', Schlamm believes that it is still reasonable to suppose that the 'contribution of religious tradition to numinous experience is relatively insignificant' and will vary according to the different moments of the numinous experience itself. Indeed, he points out that the 'tremendum and fascinans moments of numinous experi ence are influenced by their religious traditions to a much greater degree than mysterium moments of numinous experience'. 26 There may then be an element of numinous experience, namely the mysterium, that is immune to Otto's own androcentric methods of scholarship and which is available a priori to Ahndung regardless of circumstance. Then again, Otto's semi-agnostic, metaphorical theology would, to an unusual degree, protect the 'wholly otherness' of the divine from the objec tifying imperialism of ordinary knowing. The Idea of the Holy does not propose a concept of God; it offers a phenomenological analysis of (male) reactions to an unconceptualized numinous object whose gender is not yet delineated. As such, numinous experience carries no one institutional guarantee of its theological authority and the plurality of possible analogies to evoke its object could destabilize the interests of orthodox religious discourse. Otto's own Protestantism would have fed his insistence on the immediacy of the numen praesens, making him, like feminists, resistant from the outset to the theo logical realism in which priestly or textual mediation would project a literally male personality onto the divine: 23 See e.g. The Idea of the Holy, pp. I I2-I6, I36-42, I75-7. 24 See R. Forman (ed.), The Problem of Pure Consciousness (New York: Oxford University Press, I990) which contains a variety of refutations of Katz's position. For a scathing response to the Forman collection see M. Bagger, 'Ecumenicalism and Perennialism Revisited', Religious Studies, xxvii (I 99 I), 399-41 I . 25 'Numinous Experience and Religious Language', p. 548. 16 Ibid. p. 549.</page><page sequence="7">FEMINISM AND NUMINOUS EXPERIENCE 5I7 The truly 'mysterious' object is beyond our apprehension and comprehension, not only because our knowledge has certain irremovable limits, but because in it we come upon something inherently 'wholly other', whose kind and character are incommensurable with our own, and before which we therefore recoil in a wonder that strikes us chill and numb.27 Whilst religious feminist discourse is usually less agnostic than this, Otto's suspension of language might deliver religious experience from the male power of naming. The very linguistic evasiveness of The Idea of the Holy in particular lends a form of negative or agnostic mediation to numinous experience which refuses to define the experience in advance. For instance Otto's recommendation of silence as sacramental28 might offer feminists and others an experience of that enigmatic God of a liberated future: a God who is Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh - I am who I am or I will be who I will be (Ex. 3: I4). More centrally, the numinous transvaluation of moral value, which is at the heart of The Idea of the Holy and for which Otto received almost universal censure in his own life-time could contextualize numinous experience in a prophetic rejection of patriarchal values and hierarchies. At least one passage in Mysticism East and West suggests that religion recognizes the world as a glorious creation and as a sphere in which antagonism towards God must be overcome.29 Numinous experience as an intuition of a 'wholly other' value may have included a refusal of historical values, a mark of whose fallenness is surely patriarchy's consolidation of power through the profanization of women and nature. Perhaps the numinous itself finally deconstructs the received values of Otto, the one who named it. THE ANDROCENTRIC CONTEXT OF OTTO S WORK It should be conceded, then, that Otto's work has peculiarities that protect it to some extent from feminist criticism and from the constructivist argument that numinous experience would be grounded in the ideological and sym bolic discourses of an established religious community. But these peculiarities in Otto's account of numinous experience do not come from nowhere. Negative theology, pietism, romantic aesthetics and criticism of rationalistic religion, are a few obvious sources that spring to mind. More importantly, the numinous appearance only becomes a religious experience, as opposed to an emotional disturbance, when it is interpreted. And Otto's interpret ation of the numinous is, as I will show, markedly androcentric. Neither Katz nor feminist critics intend reductionism, and I would not wish to suggest that the numinous event is only a projection or transcendentalization of a political ideology. That is not only unprovable; we have seen that numinous experi ence seems to contain elements of a romantic reaction against the rational 27 The Idea of the Holy, p. 28. 28 Ibid.

See also, India's Religion of Grace and Christianity Compared and Contrasted (London: SCM, 1930), pp. 75-80.</page><page sequence="8">5I8 MELISSA RAPHAEL complacencies of the religious establishment. Nonetheless, Otto's andro centrism establishes criteria for what will count as a religious experience in that his idealist metaphysics and romantic aesthetic disqualify spiritual experience which is biologically or domestically grounded in the female sphere as mundane and ipso facto profane. Numinous experience is, he says, purified in direct ratio to its disengagement from the historically condi tioned.30 As such Otto implicitly derogates traditionally female spiritual experience and excludes it from the category of normative religious experi ence by denying its religious meaning and value. Numinous experience is chiefly characterized as creature-feeling': the sense of impotent createdness - mere nothingness - in the presence of the divine might and majesty of the numen. The majesty of the numen presup poses a deity with specific attributes that are most readily evoked in anthro pomorphic language. For Otto, God is creator, and 'man' can only begin to become holy in so far as he recognizes that he is 'creature': 'submerged and overwhelmed by its own nothingness in contrast to that which is supreme above all creatures.'31 But, arguably, women will not experience Otto's 'creature feeling' in the same way as men because the Jewish and Christian traditions usually render them creatures at least three times over. Firstly, women are, like men, creatures of God. Secondly, they are creatures of men - in the most familiar story of the creation of humankind in Genesis 2 Eve emerges from Adam's rib. And thirdly, women are socialized as creatures of male-controlled ideologies of femininity. In short, a women's being is de rivative in ways that male being is not - especially when God's personality is characterized as male. By Otto's logic then, women must feel themselves multiply profaned since creaturehood defines profanity. Similarly, Otto refines the tremendum of the divine as a tremenda majestas32 before which the subject prostrates himself in abject terror. But again his analogies between numinous experience and imperial power are twice mediated for women. A women would prostrate herself before an emperor not only because of his autocratic power, but also because as a woman her power is qualitatively other and usually quantitatively less than that of any man. In the Religious Essays it is particularly clear how the possibility of religious thought arises for Otto in the fundamental opposition between the 'spirit and the flesh '.3 Here the text is pervaded by sexual-political values in which, basically, spirit or ruach (Otto uses the Hebrew terms) is positive and flesh or basar is negative. Following Luther, flesh is characterized by Otto as a lack of faith. Profanity is equated with the uncleanness of basar34 and the soul is mystically reborn or purified in the renunciation of the material sphere.35 To be fair to Otto there is no obvious misogyny in the text. Basar seems less a signifier of femaleness than of arrogant worldliness.36 Nonetheless, Otto 30 The Idea of the Holy, p. II3. 31 Ibid. p.

To be flesh is to have been born of woman, profaned by her blood and, in adulthood, distracted by her embodiment. In short the concept of flesh carries with it freight of ancient misogynist theologies which numinous experience confirms. In the Religious Essays and The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man Otto declares even more forcefully than in The Idea of the Holy that the life of the flesh is utterly opposed to the life of spirit: 'holiness or righteousness are not possible in the present, earthly, fleshly, worldly existence, or in an existence and situation of an earthly kind', but rather, in the 'wholly other' existence 'in heaven .38 Had Otto been aware that his model of divine reality would be less 'wholly other' to men than to the majority of women (who are mothers), he might at least have hesitated in claiming that the human sensus numinis is an unconditioned and therefore universal response to a divine presence. And Otto is not the only historian of religion to premise his concept of the sacred on a duality which is sexualized by its cultural context. Valerie Saiving finds Eliade's notions of male and female sacrality to be 'at war' with one another. Whereas Eliade describes women's religious experience as biologically and domestically grounded, male religious experience is depicted as a bid for, in his own words; 'absolute freedom - that is, the desire to break the bonds that keep him tied to earth, and to free himself from his limitations'." As Eliade used Otto's work extensively it is not surprising that the same is true of the spiritual aspirations Otto predicated to 'man', only Otto's obliviousness to female difference makes the androcentric - indeed monosexual - structure of numinous experience less apparent. The feminist paradigm resists the axiological distinctions implicit in the binary opposition of the sacred and the profane.40 Because feminist theo(a)logy is strongly immanentist, a woman's embodied finitude is holy in that it belongs to the intramundane processes of divine creativity. Conse quently, feminist spirituality experiences female embodiment and its con nections with other natural forms as the primary source of empowerment 3 See Peter Brown, The Body and Society: Men, Women and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity (London: Faber &amp; Faber, I989), p. 48. 38 The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man (London: Lutterworth, I938), p. 49. Cf. The Philosophy of Religion (London: Williams and Norgate, I 93 I), p. I 3 I . In this earlier, more optimistic, period of his work Otto is still strongly influenced by Schleiermacher and is able to recommend 'a way of seeing that all that is is in fact an appearance of transcendental Reality'. 3 'Androcentrism in Religious Studies', p. I92. 40 See Nancy Jay's 'Gender and Dichotomy' in Gunew (ed.), A Reader in Feminist Knowledge, esp. pp. 9o-I, on the way in which Durkheim's separation of the sacred and the profane leads to belief that women are and should be excluded from the ritual and conceptual functions of religion; Mary Daly, Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism (London: The Women's Press, I991), pp. 47-9; Naomi Goldenberg, The Changing of the Gods (Boston: Beacon Press, I979), p.

Indeed, both the androcentric and the feminist historian of religion agree (though for different reasons) that female sacrality is not structured around priestly mechanisms of atoning self-abnegation and puri fication of the sort Otto describes.4" In Judaism, Islam, and in some of the more sacerdotal Christian denominations, the menstrual cycle alone would remind a woman week by week of her naturalness or profanity. In Western male rituals, the profanity of the female body is inseparable from its being alive whereas men can separate themselves from the profane by ablutions and other forms of separation such as, inJudaism, temporary abstention from contact with wives. By contrast, feminist spirituality (often drawing upon the history of re ligions' documentation of the manifestations of female sacrality in native horticultural traditions) locates female sacrality in biological and imagina tive fecundity and in the daily creativity of domestic life: Our feminine existence is connected to the metamorphoses of nature: the pure potential of water, the transformative power of blood, the seasonal rhythms of the earth, the cycles of lunar dark and light. Within nature too we transform matter, giving form to elemental energy, handling water and fire, cooking and baking, bearing and healing, tending and gathering, making from the earth's materials.42 The very immanence of this sacral experience is the locus of its value and religious meaning. So given that the traditional divisions of spiritual and other labour have demanded that female energies be expended in the skill of nourishing new life and transforming raw materials into cultural artifacts,43 a woman's sense of her own sacrality cannot simply be translated into that of men, especially when female sacrality signifies not just difference but opposition or profanity in male religious rituals - as it does within Otto's dualistic transcendental scheme. It is also important to supplement these phenomenological arguments against immediate religious experience with some brief consideration of the role of gender in the epistemological processes in which a numinous experi ence is recognized as having religious meaning and value. If these very epistemological processes are formed by sexual politics then Otto's bid to protect them from conceptual pollution seems naive. Traditional epistem ology is criticized by all feminisms as ideologically grounded in a dualistic system at least partly originating in the sorts of religious values which we have seen Otto promoting in the Religious Essays. Feminism is deeply critical of traditional Western epistemology which divides private consciousness from the external, natural, communal world and where the 'highest' knowing is 41 See e.g. The Idea of the Holy, p. 57. 42 Meinrad Craighead, 'Immanent Mother', in M.

As Bonnie Miller-McLemore writes, 'the vital role of gender in knowing has only come to the fore explicitly with the advancement of feminist reflection and the achievement of a " critical mass " of women in academe '. Religious feminism's challenge to epistemology is to question 'not simply what and how we think about religion, but who is doing the thinking, and what counts as theological and religious knowing'.45 Her article suggests that mothers in particular, who, as speaking subjects, are absent from religious and ethical texts, achieve a spiritual knowledge that is peculiarly body-mediated in the intimacy and plurality of having carried another being inside them. The essentialism of much feminist epistemology is not at issue here. It is the sharp contrast between Otto's religious epistemology and maternal/relational epistemologies of the sort discussed by Miller-McLemore, Beverly Harrison, Sara Ruddick and many others, that must be considered. Otto's epistemology is underpinned by his reciprocally related theology and phenomenology. Otto builds a picture of the divine from apparently cross-cultural phenomenological responses to its numinous appearance. The overwhelming majority of Otto's examples preclude intimacy or even re lationship with the divine in any contemporary understanding of that word. In The Idea of the Holy the divine is knowable only in so far as the profane subject reports how he trembled before it and sought to protect himself from the charge of its holy purity, and the holy from contamination by his own loathsome presence.46 In the Religious Essays the Godhead is autocratically determined only by itself. The simplicitas dei is defined in opposition to manifold, composite being of the sort exemplified by childbearing women.47 Disregarding the problems of discontinuities in Otto's theological voice, the masculinist quality of his solitary, enthroned deity becomes clear in comparison with a gynocentric analogy of divine empowering: the womb - both human and cosmic. The womb both symbolizes and embodies a spiri tuality premised upon security, nourishment, relationality and co-creation with God/ess. Accordingly, a maternal epistemology will choose, recognize, and value immanentist religious experiences of the sort described by Monica Sjoo. Sjoo is perhaps the best known of Goddess feminists giving the feminine ontological priority in the divine and so regarding the cosmos as essentially feminine in character. Several days after her experience of the Goddess at Silbury mound ('the pregnant womb of the earth'), she wrote it down during ' a prophetic or trance state'. The experience has numinous elements of fear, otherness, and the overwhelmingly powerful presence of the 'dark aspect of the Goddess'. But these elements are accommodated and understood in Sjoo's experience of her own embodiment: 44 'Epistemology or Bust: A Maternal Feminist Knowledge of Knowing', The Journal of Religion, LXXII (1985), 229-47, pp. 232-3. 45 Ibid. p. 233. 46 The Idea of the Holy, pp. 54-5. 47 P. 83. 20-2</page><page sequence="12">522 MELISSA RAPHAEL I look at Her mound ... so exposed ... like veins on a breast streaking Her sides ... again overwhelmed by tears and sorrow. I now understand what Mother Earth means ... something so enormous, powerful ... also so painful in my own woman's body which is like Hers ... violent but gentle ... powerful but vulnerable.48 It is true that in The Idea of the Holy numinous experience also presupposes embodiment: it is usually accompanied by acute physical symptoms: spasms, convulsions, frenzy and 'almost grisly horror and shuddering'.49 None theless, the sacred is known in the Seelengrund - a particular element of the mind - not the body. Numinous consciousness is a primarily cognitive response, albeit of a special non-rational kind. Yet if women's religious experience is even less likely to be purely cerebral than men's, the uncon ditioned Seelengrund is inadequate to the totality of female experience. Women's religious knowing incorporates values and its own psycho-physical mediation. Conversely, the transcendentalist alienations within numinous experience may have been reinforced by Otto's desire to circumvent his own embodiment: his debilitating asthma, his - presumably - celibate state and his recurrent depression. These axiological and epistemological considerations are applicable ir respectively of whether numinous experience is categorized as mystical or theistic. On the one hand, Leon Schlamm has recently defended Otto's view of numinous experience as being similar and complementary to mystical experience. For example, the numinous tremendum of 'creature feeling' is found in continuous form but differing proportions in the mystical experience of the annihilation of the self as swallowed up in the reality of the transcen dent.50 If there is no radical distinction between numinous experience and mystical experience then the mystical form of' creature consciousness' would not elude patriarchal conditioning and mediation, though it may be less graphically expressed than the numinous form discussed above. On the other hand, if Ninian Smart (among others) is right that numinous experience is non-mystical then Otto's belief that numinous experience is immediate is perhaps even less tenable. Smart contends that numinous experience refers to a personal divine being external to the subject, whose 'outer and thunderous quality [is] not characteristic of the cloud of un knowing within '51 Moreover, according to Smart, 'the sense of the terrifying mystery of the divine' in numinous experience 'implies a converse sense of one's own inadequacy and lack of holiness ' 52 Women who have traditionally been ontologically disqualified from religious and priestly office would feel this inadequacy more sharply than men.

Certainly, in its most theistic forms numinous experience is not strictly ineffable because it is a reaction to, and hence an indirect description of, a form of theophany. Creature-feeling 'indubitably has immediate and primary reference to an object outside the self',54 and it is the degree to which that object is ration alized which for Otto marks the 'high rank and superior value' of a religion and the highest stage in the evolution of religious consciousness.55 But for feminism, the further monarchical monotheism rationalizes the object of its experiences the more obviously susceptible it becomes to deconstruction as an anthropomorphic projection which divinizes male political power. For even if these rationalizations are not strictly descriptive, an evocation of the numen is not a random selection of words. It is a linguistic approximation appropriate to an object which is only intelligible to the subject by virtue of its qualities already occupying the highest possible value status in the subject's culture. Let us turn to a fairly straightforward example of a Western theistic numinous experience in order to go on show that feminist revision of the axiological context of religious experience would make such experiences not only theo(a)logically inhospitable but also unlikely to occur. Nathan Soderblom, the historian of religion, described an experience he had in I 893, before he became Archbishop of Uppsala. Writing in the third person, he tells us that he was returning home from church on Sunday and, There came over him what might be called a direct perception of the holiness of God. He understood what he had long felt indistinctly, that God was far stricter than he could imagine or that anyone can really comprehend. God is a consuming fire. This apprehension was so powerful, so shattering, that he was unable to stay on his feet... He moaned and groaned under this might grasp.56 A feminist reading of this reported (and hence conceptualized) numinous experience would find, not just the language, but the form of the experience conditioned by a patriarchal concept of God. The divine is experienced as an authoritarian, infinitely 'strict' controlling deity who asserts his power by humiliation: by physically and emotionally disabling his human subject who he 'grasps' as if in a giant fist. That Soderblom is metaphorically reduced to ashes suggests a cremation more than a spiritual rebirth. Of course, this is not the only possible reading of Soderblom's experience and it is not intended to trivialize it. What is noteworthy for the present article is that 5 For counter-arguments against Smart's categorization of numinous experience, see P.

These common points alone would reinforce the Katzian argument. In addition, postmodern feminism argues for a constitutive relation be tween knowledge claims and socio-religious power. The dominant discourse community maintains its interests by suppressing those discourses which pose a threat to its authority and universality: in the present case, those sub jugated gynocentric discourses recovered by feminists committed to the emancipation of female sacrality. These discourses offer a paradigm shift which resacralizes the human body and its erotic possibilities. Once that spiritual-political revolution has been achieved, a numinous experience might look very different, or indeed cease to be possible in the terms Soderblom and Otto described. For example, from her own religious ex perience Kathryn Allen Rabuzzi has (literally) domesticated Otto's account of the mysterium claiming that housework creates a ritual space for the numinous presence of Vesta, the Goddess of the hearth.57 Not all feminists would accept Rabuzzi's paradoxically conservative rad icalism, but her reunion of the supernatural and the mundane in feminist religious experience would not be controversial. Mary Grey's reaction to Otto's account of numinous experience is typical of Christian feminism which models redemption on a renewal of authentic, fully embodied relationships within humankind and the whole biosphere. In Redeeming the Dream: Feminism, Redemption and the Christian Tradition Grey (generalizing somewhat) rejects Otto's account of numinous experience as 'totally opposed to what women have experienced'.58 The experience of the divine as mysterium tremendum et fascinans is, she argues, modelled on separation from the object of experience: 'the deeper the experience the greater the awe and terribleness of God as wholly other. Spirituality will then consist in recognizing that one is dust and ashes before the deity'.59 I would qualify this by noting that although self consciously feminist religious experience is grounded in a celebration of the fecundity that has been denigrated implicitly in Otto's concept of holiness, one cannot say that women's experience is simply 'opposed' to numinous experience because the majority of women in the Abrahamic faiths have been thoroughly socialized into, and so have internalized, a patriarchal hierarchy of spiritual values. Perhaps Grey should have said that it would be better for women if they did not perceive the divine presence in this manner. None theless, if women do have numinous experiences, those experiences may be continuous with many of their experiences of personal insignificance in the presence of men and are therefore sub-religious. And if women do have numi T The Sacred and the Feminine: Toward a Theology of Housework (New York: Seabury Press, I982), pp. 6I-2. 58 (London: SPCK, I989), p. 44. 59 Ibid. p. 44.</page><page sequence="15">FEMINISM AND NUMINOUS EXPERIENCE 525 nous experiences it seems unlikely that theirs would be essentially the same as men's if for no other reason than that numinous experience, as Otto evokes it, is linguistically and conceptually funded by male values and experience. It is difficult to know whether women have typically Ottonian numinous experiences or not,60 though we have seen that an experience of the presence of 'The Great Mother' may contain some broadly numinous features such as awe or the feeling of the uncanny. However, outside The Idea of the Holy, those of Archbishop Soderblom and Mole in Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows are among the very few Western reports of clearly numinous ex perience with which I am acquainted. In some senses women would find numinous experience less overwhelming than would men (or moles) since their typically modest self-valorization already demands less adjustment than that of men. Society is so organized that hubris is not commonly a female sin.61 But of course, the logical possibility must remain that a divine per sonality is such that it actually demands self-abnegation and separation from the cycles of nature, even if, contingently, experiences of such a deity are not congenial to spiritual feminists or conducive to the spiritual development of women in patriarchal cultures. Whatever its outcome, it seems clear that the constructivist debate is profoundly relevant for all scholarship which properly recognizes the consti tutive importance of gender difference in the study of religious experience. Irrespective of the divisions within Western religious feminism,62 the pres entation of male sacral experience as generic of the 'innermost essence' of human religious experience has been recognized by Christian, Jewish and neo-pagan feminists as a falsification of many women's religious experiences. In consequence reformist feminists can utilize constructivist insights to con solidate their belief that they are right to remain in their own faith tradition even when its best revelation has been distorted by its patriarchal context. These feminists can feel confident that once in a non-patriarchal social and theological context, the biblical or Qur'anic tradition will fulfil its promise of liberation and authentic divine-human relationship. Constructivism also justifies post-Christian and post-Jewish feminists' re-appropriation of female sacral powers by naming as sacred in gynocentric religion what has been profane in androcentric religion in acknowledging that the political context mediates and changes the meaning of a religious experience. Constructivism allows that in all religious feminism female experience will determine the form and content of spiritualities which privilege biophilic, erotic experience 60 See e.g. T. Beardsworth, A Sense of Presence (Manchester College, Oxford: The Religious Experience Research Unit, I977), pp. I i6-28. All female respondents report a comforting, markedly non-numinous divine presence. 61 See V. Saiving, 'The Human Situation: A Feminine View,' in C. Christ and J. Plaskow (eds.), Womanspirit Rising (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1979), pp. 25-42. 62 These divisions revolve around women's decision to reform the patriarchal tradition from within, or to depart for new or rediscovered - generally neo-pagan - non-masculinist religious environments.</page><page sequence="16">526 MELISSA RAPHAEL as both paradigm and medium of divine-human relations. Both radical and reformist feminists are immanentist to varying degrees. So whether the essential reality of the divine is or is not actually available to finite conscious ness becomes a pseudo-problem since God/ess is no longer classically dicho tomized into essential and manifest being. Religious feminists celebrate the mediation of the divine presence by mundane things as integral to the meaning of the experience. In and through finite things 'we may apprehend the incarnate presence of the holy in all of creation. Through them God our Mother communicates with us through her body, within her own mysterious creation.'63 Whereas Otto believed that the divine would always be a strictly alien presence even if the natural world (at its most impressive) could stimulate numinous consciousness, in feminist religious experience the medium is inseparable from the experience. The 'Mothergod' 'who never withdraws from us and whose presence is our existence and the life of all that is' is mediated 'through the natural, elemental, symbols'.64 In sum, the feminist revision of the politics and substance of religious experience shows that numinous experience is unlikely to be (and still less to remain) the comprehensive core of both men and women's sense of holiness. Instead, 'it is just possible that the unheard testimony of that half of the human species which has for so long been rendered inarticulate may have something to tell us about the holy which we have not known'. 65 Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education, P0 Box 220, The Park, Cheltenham GL5o 2QF 63 Craighead, 'Immanent Mother', p. 8I.
