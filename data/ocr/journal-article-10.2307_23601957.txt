<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEWISH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES* An Outline of Types of Organizations, Activities and Problems By Maurice J. Karpf, ph.d. The Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, New York City I. THE JEWISH POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS DISTRIBUTION It is estimated that there are approximately four and a half million Jews in the United States. They constitute a little over 3&gt;^% of the total population. Curious as it may seem there is no exact information about the number of Jews, their age and sex distribution, and to what extent they are of native or immigrant stock. This lack of infor mation is due to the fact that the United States Census, taken every ten years, includes no questions regarding religious affiliation. Nor does it take cognizance of racial groups except to differentiate between the white and colored races. Nor are the results of the enumeration by mother tongue, included in the decennial Federal census since 1920, a clue to the Jewish population, since comparatively few *This study was prepared for the second International Conference on Jewish Socia Work held in London, July 8-10, 1936. It follows closely an outline prepared by the writer, as President of the Conference, which was sent to the participating countries. The material was gathered and the manuscript prepared in 1935 and 1936 for presen tation to the Conference. It has since been enlarged, revised and brought up to date. It It was the writer's aim to produce a comprehensive, though brief, outline of organized Jewish life in the United States. Since the study was primarily intended for foreign readers explanatory notes were included which some American readers may think unnecessary. They have been retained because several people who read the original manuscript insisted that many readers in the United States will find them helpful and valuable. The writer aimed to be as factual and objective as possible. Accordingly, every effort was made at verification and documentation. Illustrative and corroborative material was used wherever possible, not excluding the last section, which deals with current trends and tendencies and must, necessarily, reflect the writer's point of</page><page sequence="2">48 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Jews claim Yiddish or Hebrew as their mother-tongue, and there is no way of differentiating between Jews and non Jews who claim German, Russian, Polish, Roumanian and the other languages representing the countries from which comparatively large numbers of Jews came to the United States.1 However, those interested in Jewish life have need for accurate figures regarding the Jewish population. Attempts have therefore been made from time to time to secure the information upon which to base as reliable an estimate as possible. The most important of these consists of a study made in 1927, in connection with the decennial Census of Religious Bodies, under the auspices of the American Jewish Committee, in cooperation with the United States Bureau of the Census. This study, based on about 4000 inquiries sent to representative Jews in every city, town, and village that could be reached, indicated that there are about 4,230, 000 Jews in the United States.2 Various other studies have been made in a number of cities to determine their Jewish population. In such studies, the method usually consisted of taking the absences in the public schools on the High Holy Days, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, comparing them with absences on other days and estimating the Jewish population on that basis. view. In addition to serving the usual purposes the footnotes and references contain additional sources for further reading and study. A great deal of the material to be found in the following pages is published here for the first time. It is based on research over many years, which the writer his col leagues, and his students have conducted. It is hoped that this study will stimulate further research on some of the problems which stand in great need of scientific inves tigation. The nature of the&lt; material and the desire for brevity precluded mentioning the names of even those who have played leading roles in the different activities outlined. The problem of selection and exclusion was formidable, hence no names were included. This, however, should not be taken to indicate a lack of appreciation on the part of the writer, of the time, thought, energy, and effort spent by numberless socially minded lay and professional people on the problems facing Jewish life in the United States, toward which they devoted themselves so wholeheartedly and to the solution of which they made such substantial contributions. The writer desires to acknowledge with gratitude and appreciation the help of Mr. Harry Schneiderman, Editor of the American Jewish Year Book, who read the manu script and made numerous helpful and valuable suggestions. Mr. Abraham G. Duker, Research Librarian of the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, also was very helpful. Grateful acknowledgement is hereby made. 2 For notes and references see pp. 138 -148.</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 49 This method, based on the assumption that all children, Jewish and non-Jewish, attend the public schools, is some what crude, for it is well known that a number of Jewish children attend school on the High Holy Days and therefore are lost in the count, and that non-Jewish children frequently take advantage of these holidays. The student of popula tion figures will recognize a more fundamental difficulty in this method because it depends upon accurate knowledge of the size of families and age distribution. Since no ac curate information with respect to the Jewish group is available on these items, the estimate must, of course, suffer. Another method is based on Jewish mortality. The as sumption here is that Jews, regardless of their affiliations in life, arrange for Jewish burials. This method too has obvious limitations, and is open to the same objections as the others. A number of refinements of these and other methods have been suggested and tried but none is entirely satisfactory. It is becoming increasingly clear that until an actual census of Jews is taken,, there will be no accurate information as to the number of Jews in the United States.3 For all practical purposes, however, the estimate given above may be assumed to be correct. On the basis of all of these estimates it is fairly well known that the Jewish population in the United States is mainly concentrated in the large cities. The 1927 study referred to above, indicates that there are about 10,000 cities, towns, villages, and rural areas containing Jewish residents. Jews live in every city of 25,000 or over; in about 90% of the cities of 25,000 or less; in about 30% of the villages of 2,500 or less; and in about 7% of the rural areas. This study also disclosed the facts that approximately 11% of the total population in cities having populations of 100,000 or over, are Jews; about 3% of cities between 25,000 and 100,000; about 1.6% in cities of 25,000 to 10,000; about .84% in cities of 10,000 to 5,000; about .7% in cities of 5,000 to 2,500; about .5% in rural incorporated villages; and about .15% in unincorporated rural territories. Stated differently, this study might be said to show that out of every 100 cities nearly 90 have Jewish residents; out of every 100 villages only 30 have Jewish residents; whereas in the country districts only 7 in every 100 have Jewish residents.</page><page sequence="4">50 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK The foregoing figures do not give an adequate picture of the concentration of the Jewish population in the United States. This concentration may be better appreciated if it is borne in mind that 11 American cities contain 2,911,000 Jews, or approximately 69% of the total Jewish population; also, that 68 cities of 100,000 or over, have 3,553,000, or approximately 84%; that 209 cities of 25,000 to 100,000 have approximately 379,000 Jews or 9% of the Jewish population; that 461 cities between 10,000 and 25,000 have 111,700 Jews, or 2J^%; that 721 cities of 5,000 to 10,000 have about 42,000 Jews or 1%; that 1321 cities of 2,500 to 5,000 have about 32,400 Jews or.8%; that 12,908 rural areas of 2,500 or less have 43,500 Jews or 1%; and that the rural unincorporated areas have about 66,000 Jews or 1.5% of the Jewish population in the United States. The table below, (Table 1), based on the 1927 study, compares the Jewish with total population in these dif ferent areas. The discrepancies are striking and significant. It makes clear that the Jewish population in this country is largely an urban population. It is to be expected, there fore, that it will be subject to all the problems arising in urban communities. Some of these will be traced and dis cussed in the following pages.

These were were carried on by organizations which aimed at sending immigrants into the interior cities after arrangements were made for their employment there. The most important of these was The Industrial Removal Office, (I.R.O.) which functioned between 1901 and 1922. It was responsible for distributing about 79,000 people between the years of 1901 and 1917, the last year for which figures are available. The Galveston Movement was an attempt to divert part of the stream of Jewish immigrants from the Eastern port cities to the West by routing them to Galveston, Texas. This effort was organized in 1906 and was suspended in 1908 because of the depression at that time. It was resumed in 1910 but was definitely abandoned in 1914 because of the World War. A similar effort is now being made to distribute German Jewish immigrants in the interior, through the National Coordinating Committee for German Refugees. (Seep.(Seep. 118).׳» "Students of Jewish population usually assume that the Jewish population is somewhat older than is the general population. This is due to the fact that the Jewish popula tion has a large proportion of immigrants who have arrived since 1880. (See p. 68.) The differentials are unknown. A city-wide study of the youth in New York City made by the Research Department of the Welfare Council of New York City,5 on the basis of visits to each hundredth residential address, a device which yielded interviews with 9,041 young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24, shows some very interesting results regarding the nativity of parents. Table 2, which is based on Table 1 of that study, is self-explanatory. Attention should be called to the com paratively small percentage of Jewish youth with both parents native (8.7%). It is also interesting to note that 82.1% of the Jewish parents came either from Russia, Poland, or Austria. But it should be borne in mind that New York City is not necessarily representative of the rest of the country.</page><page sequence="6">52 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK TABLE 2 Nativity of Parents of New York City Youth (Based on a study of every hundredth family) Nativity of Parents Total Catholic (Roman) Jewish Protestant Number of Young People in Study 9,041 4.392 2,835 1.6063 White 96.0b 98.9b 100.0 80.9° Both Parents Native 24.3 28.3 8.7 42.5 One or both parents born in a foreign country 71.7 70.6 91.3 38.4 Italy 21.9 44.5 0.1 1.7 Russia 18.4 55.6 0.8 Poland 6.2 5.7 10.2 0.7 Austria 6.5 2.2 16.3 1.0 Ireland 4.4 8.4 1.7 Germany 3.1 2.0 1.0 10.2 Hungary 1.6 1.4 2.3 1.1 England 1.2 0.7 0.4 4.1 Other0, or not reported 8.4 5.7 5.5 17.1 * 208 failed to report religious affiliation. b Negroes constitute the difference between this and 100 per cent. 0 Less than 1 per cent, born in any one country. More or less reliable estimates have been made of the growth of the Jewish population in the United States as follows: TABLE 3 Estimates of the Number of Jews in the U.

ECONOMIC DISTRIBUTION There is even greater paucity of information regarding the vocational distribution of Jews than regarding their vital statistics. There are no studies available on the num ber of Jews in commerce, industry and the professions. It is generally assumed that they are represented in commerce in much larger numbers than their proportion of the pop ulation; and that they are represented in industry mainly in the manufacture of light industries. Until comparatively recently they dominated the clothing industry, both among employers and employees. In recent years, however, the situation has been changing very perceptibly. While accurate information is not available, the clothing industry, which was at one time almost wholly Jewish, now consists of be tween 40% and 50% Jewish workers and a much larger percentage of Jewish owners. The Jewish workers are gradually being displaced by the Polish, Italian, Spanish, and Negro groups. This is largely because the sons and daughters of Jewish tailors do not, as a rule, enter the same field and there has been no large Jewish immigration for almost two decades to replenish the losses.7 A study recently published in one of the foremost Amer ican periodicals, Fortune, gives some interesting facts about Jewish participation in the commercial and industrial life of the United States. While the information is fairly ac curate, it cannot be accepted as absolutely so. It may be summarized as follows: In domestic and international finance, American Jews play a relatively minor role. While there are a few important Jewish banks they are in no way to to be compared in size or importance with the non-Jewish banks. Even the few Jewish banks have a considerable sprinkling of non-Jewish partners in them. There are very few Jewish employees in, or Jews on the boards of, non-Jewish banks. Jews are also sparsely represented in the following: on the controlling boards of brokerage houses dealing in stocks and bonds, and insurance companies; among owners and workers of heavy industry such as steel, automobiles, coal, rubber, oil, shipping and transportation: public utility boards controlling the sources of light and power. The situation is somewhat better in the light industries, such as</page><page sequence="8">54 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK textiles, silks, clothing, the distilling industry, tobacco industry, etc. But even in these, with the exception of clothing and textiles, where the Jews are largely represented as manufacturers and middle men, respectively, they do not play a dominant role. Jews have a large share in mer chandising, a number of important department stores being owned or managed by Jews; they are relatively unimportant in the control of the daily press, magazines, advertising, radio, and other media for shaping public opinion. Not even in the amusement field, except in the cinema, do they exercise a major influence. The author insists that in the legal and medical professions, despite popular impression and anti-Semitic claims to the contrary, Jews play by no means the role usually ascribed to them, especially if legal and medical "power" is considered instead of numbers of practitioners. He concludes that "Jews do not dominate the American scene. They do not even dominate major sectors of the American scene."8 The foregoing refers mostly to ownership. The problem of getting information regarding participation of Jewish labor in the different fields is very much more difficult, there is no exact information regarding the number of Jewish workers in any field. A study made in 1929 of 50 trade unions located in New York City, with a total membership of 392,000 indicated that 134,000, roughly about one-third, were Jews. Two facts must be borne in mind in this con nection. One is that the study was in New York City, where the Jewish population is approximately one-third of the total population, and the second is that the trade union study included the United Hebrew Trades, which are very largely Jewish. It is for this reason that the range of Jewish membership in these 50 trade unions was from about 8% in transportation and communication, to 98% in the retail salesmen's union. The fields of industry studied were: food preparation and distribution with 54% Jewish membership; needle trades, 59%; leather trades, 66%; building trades, 24%; printing trades, 17%; amusement trades, 37%; jew elryelry and ornament trades, 35%; and miscellaneous, 24%.9 There can be no question that in cities where the Jewish populatiôn is less, proportionately, than in New York City these percentages would vary widely. Nor can there be</page><page sequence="9">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 55 any question that for the country as a whole the percentages would be much lower. Unfortunately, there are no data for comparative purposes. A study made in 1935 throws interesting light on the distribution of Jews in various occupations. This study comprised approximately 17,000 Jews listed in the New York City directory under five typically Jewish names (Gins berg, Friedman, Goldberg, Goldstein, Levy) and was com pared with a typically non-Jewish name (Smith), listed in the same directory.10 Table 4 compares the distribution of Jewish and non Jewish males in 15 occupations on the basis of this study.

But it is impossible to say to what extent they are typical of the general population of New York City and of the entire country. A test was made in a comparison of the data secured from the city directory with the information available in the Federal census for the same area. The comparison is presented in Tables 6 and 7. But these data, too, while interesting and suggestive, are inconclusive, because the Jewish population is so large a factor in the census figures for this area. They do open up interesting possibilities and it is hoped that as a result of these and other studies we shall have more reliable and more revealing information on Jewish economic distribution in the United States than is now available.13 Table 6 compares the occupational distribution of male Jews with that of the non-Jewish population in New York City based on the Federal census.

The agricultural activities of the Jews in the United States date back about 50 years. Organized activity, how ever, began at the turn of this century. The foremost Jewish organization dealing with this aspect of Jewish economic life in the United States is the Jewish Agricultural Society, organized by the Baron de Hirsch Fund. In the thirty-six years of its functioning, it has spent about $3,800, 000 in aiding Jewish farmers. It estimates that about 1,500,000 acres are owned by Jews, and that there are ap proximately 16,000 families devoting their time, in whole or in part, to farming. The aggregate loans made to Jewish farmers by this organization amounted to about $12,000,000, of which about $1,250,000 came out of interest paid on the loans. This represents a remarkable growth for there was a time when there were very few Jewish farmers in the United States. There are, however, no large Jewish agri cultural enterprises. Jewish agricultural endeavor consists mainly of small farms, some of which cater to vacationists during the summer months. There is a Jewish school for farming which has been in existence for forty years. It</page><page sequence="14">60 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK has not been outstandingly successful, for the majority of its graduates entered other occupations than that for which they were prepared in the School.16 Among the professions, Jews are most heavily represented in medicine, law and accounting. Here, too, it is commonly believed that they exceed by far their numerical proportion in the population. This has, in fact, been one of the prob lems with which far-sighted Jewish leaders have been con cerned. There is everywhere evident a feeling that wisdom dictates a better distribution in these fields. This is due mainly to a growing tendency toward limitation of Jewish applicants in schools of medicine and law and to ever-de creasing opportunities for Jewish practitioners in these two professions. It is common practice in the United States for graduates of a medical school to have a year or more of interneship in a hospital. In a large number of states, such interneship is a prerequisite for a license to practice medicine. Jewish graduates find it extremely difficult, and in some parts of the country practically impossible, to secure interne ships in non-Jewish hospitals. Similarly, Jewish physicians as a rule find it difficult or impossible to secure appoint ments to staffs in non-Jewish hospitals.17 There has been some agitation for Jewish medical schools. Thus far the preponderant opinion has been that it would be unwise to create such institutions.18 The situation in the legal field does not lend itself to the same type of discrimination. But there are numerous evidences of fairly intense feeling in legal circles against the large number of Jews in the profession. Some of the better law schools in the country have an unofficial quota for Jewish students. Many Legal or Bar Associations, which frequently influence, if they do not dominate the examinations for license to practice law in the different states, directly or indirectly discriminate against Jewish applicants. From time to time statements appear which, though unofficial in character, are nevertheless significant because of their sources, that Jews in these professions engage in unethical practices. Although it must be obvious to any fair minded person that such unethical practices as exist are by no means limited to Jews, the charge is, nevertheless, leveled against them. Thus far, no concerted</page><page sequence="15">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 61 effort has been made to prove or disprove such charges or to deal with the problem from a long-range point of view. The accounting profession is more or less similar to those already discussed, but since the accountant usually functions in relation to a business organization, which is his client, there is an automatic and fairly effective check on the op portunities for Jewish accountants. A profession which is becoming more and more restricted for Jews is that of teaching in the primary and secondary schools and universities. Though the primary and secondary schools are financed from tax funds, there is a growing dis crimination against Jewish teachers. In the larger cities, it is comparatively easy for Jews to secure positions in the public schools, and considerable numbers are employed in them. In the smaller communities, it is extremely difficult and in some instances practically impossible for Jews to secure teaching positions. This is due not only to discrim ination against Jews but to the fact that the teacher is expected to participate in the religious life of the community. Since the Jewish teacher cannot easily do this in a Christian community, the situation becomes embarrassing and fre quently impossible for him. This is not an exclusively Jewish problem since Catholics face similar situations in many communities. There are many instances in which Jewish Jewish young men and women fail to give their religious affiliation or will indicate affiliation with non-denominational religious groups, such as Ethical Culture, Quakers, etc., in order to secure positions. But even such methods are no longer effective, for among school boards, school superin tendents, and teachers' employment agencies, it is commonly assumed that when one indicates "no religious affiliation" or "Ethical Culture" etc., the applicant is very likely Jewish. In university teaching, the situation is much more ag gravated. It is very difficult these days for Jews to become full professors in the leading universities. In order to at tain such rank, they must have achieved distinction in their respective fields of national and international char acter. While Jews constitute a considerable proportion of the student bodies in the colleges and universities through out the land, certainly much more than their numerical proportion, they represent but an insignificant proportion</page><page sequence="16">62 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK of the faculties. This situation is very serious because Jews are gradually being eliminated from the educational field and will ultimately be charged with making no con tribution to it. Recently, largely due to the depression during the past seven years, economic opportunities for Jews have become progressively more restricted. Office work for Jewish ste nographers, typists, bookkeepers and clerical workers is extremely difficult to obtain. There are large employers of such labor, especially the large corporations, which will not employ Jewish help. To make the situation worse, there are some Jewish firms which discriminate against Jewish applicants. In all of these fields, therefore, economic opportunities for Jews are constantly contracting.19 There is, of course, no official governmental restriction against Jews. They are to be found in considerable numbers among the civil service employees in city, state and national government, although it must be admitted that here, too, there is some under-cover discrimination. To the student of this problem, it is easily evident that the Jew faces dif Acuities in every field of endeavor. Newspaper advertise ments for workers occasionally carry such statements as "gentiles only," although they are less frequent than com monly supposed. This is probably due to a policy on the part of the newspapers against them. The reasons for these attitudes are many and varied. They are frequently con tradictory. Studies which have been made indicate that the reasons cover the entire gamut of undesirable char acteristics which the Jewish employee is presumed to possess. Most often they are given as "aggressiveness," "over-weening ambition," "radicalism," "trade-union ac tivity," "unreliability," "loudness," "bad manners," etc.20 Jewish leaders have been concerned with this problem. Thus far, however, it is only in the discussion stage. While everyone seems to be aware of it, while some have given public expression of their uneasiness and feeling that some thing must be done about it, nothing of a concerted nature has thus far been undertaken. It requires the type of think ing, planning, and resources which are apparently not yet available in organized Jewish life in the United States.21 However, there is some evidence that communities are</page><page sequence="17">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 63 awakening to the problem and are organizing themselves to meet it. Several communities have created vocational agencies. Although these have thus far concentrated their efforts on finding employment for the unemployed they are are beginning to study the problems of vocational distri bution as well as vocational and educational guidance. III. JEWISH, NON-JEWISH RELATIONSHIPS Although it has been estimated that there are about fifty organizations, large and small, whose dominant motif is anti-Semitism, there is no general or nation-wide organiza tion for purely anti-Semitic purposes. Such organizations as do exist or have existed in the past, such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Silver Shirts, etc., usually include opposition to other minority groups in their program. Thus the Ku Klux Klan opposed Catholics and Negroes as well. The Black Legion, an organization similar to the Ku Klux Klan came into prominence in 1936. The state of Michigan was the main field for its activities which included a series of mur ders. Its hostile agitation was directed against all non Protestant groups. However, from time to time, organ izations and activities appear which do aim at the Jews. Such an organization was the Silver Shirts, with its various publications; the Dearborn Independent, financed by Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, who later retracted and apologized to the Jewish people; and a number of others. There are also other activities on the American scene which have an anti-Semitic tinge. The activities of Father Cough lin, the radio priest, and the successors to the late Senator Huey Long from Louisiana, who set up a virtual dictator ship in that state, and was aiming for the Presidency of the United States, may be included in this category. Happily, these groups and activities have had no govern mental support whatsoever. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that the American government, and in the vast majority of instances, the state and local governments, are opposed to any type of anti-Semitic activities just as they are opposed to any other activities tending to create racial strife. But it must be recognized that the racial and religious questions are latent if not active in the American scene.</page><page sequence="18">64 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK One need only recall the Presidential campaign of 1928, when Alfred E. Smith, former Governor of the state of New York, the most outstanding Catholic layman and statesman at the time, was the democratic candidate for President, and the campaign of religious prejudice and bigotry on the basis of the Catholic issue which was waged against him, to appreciate what can be done. Similiarly, one need only think of the situation of the Negroes in the South, the pre judice against them, the frequent acts of mob violence and lynching of Negroes, the social, economic, and political dis crimination practiced against them in the South, as well as race riots in Northern cities, to realize that racial and religious antagonisms and conflicts are neither unknown nor impossible in the United States. From time to time there appear pamphlets, articles, and books, which indicate that the Jewish issue is not far from the surface, and that it would require comparatively little provocation to bring it to the surface. On the other hand, a number of Jews hold prominent positions in American public life. In 1932, the Governors of the States of Illinois, New York, Oregon and New Mexico, were Jews. The first two states have large Jewish populations, but the number of Jews in the last two is negligible. Two of the outstanding liberal judges on the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court in the land, are Jews, and they are uni versally respected for their legal scholarship, humanitarian ism, and courage. There are now, and there have been almost from the beginning of this Republic, Jews in the Congress of the United States. Other Jews prominent in the judicial, diplomatic and other public services might be mentioned as proof that there is no official anti-Semitism in the United States.22 The provocation for bringing the anti-Jewish question into the open, in fact almost creating the issue, was un fortunately provided in the depression which has lasted for almost seven years. In all such situations, a scapegoat is sought, and any convenient one seized upon. Several at tempts have been made to use the Jew and Jewish influence in governmental affairs, especially in the Roosevelt adminis tration, as this convenient scapegoat. The situation in Germany and the Hitler propaganda in the United States</page><page sequence="19">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 65 and elsewhere have seriously aggravated the situation. The enormous publicity which has been given in the Amer ican press to the Nazi attitudes, programs, and activities against the Jews, has not strengthened the Jewish position in the United States, although there are innumerable gen tiles who are incensed at what Nazi Germany is doing.23 The national election campaign of 1936 was of tremen dous importance from the standpoint of the fear and inse curity which it aroused in Jews and liberal-minded non-Jews, because of the anti-Jewish propaganda in which the oppo nents of President Roosevelt engaged. His remarkable victory left no doubt that anti-Semitism is not a safe cam paign issue in the United States. Various attempts have been made to deal with the situa tion. The propaganda against the Nazis and their regime; the identification of the type of discrimination against Jews, with discriminations either immediate or ultimate against other minority groups; the stimulation of labor and other liberal groups to the realization that Nazi Germany and its program represent a threat to them; the boycott against Germany, and especially the non-Jewish participation in the boycott; the coupling of the present German govern ment's activity against the Jews with its war activities and threats to the peace of the world; all of these are aspects of the efforts at combating not only the German influence in this country but also the. rise of anti-Semitism and in tolerance in whatever guise. It is impossible to estimate the results of these activities. Many believe that were the Jews to present a united front to the world in these and other efforts, however much they might differ internally, a great deal more could have been accomplished. Others view the situation differently and hold that a united front could be accomplished only through compromise and more can be achieved by each group pursu ing its own program vigorously.24 One of the safeguards in the Jewish position in the United States rests in the relationship between the different religious groups. While there can be no doubt that there is consid erable antagonism between Protestants and Catholics, and between them and the Jews, there is also no doubt that,</page><page sequence="20">66 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK insofar as the organized activities of these groups are con cerned, there is every desire, both official and unofficial, for cooperation, understanding, and tolerance. There are numerous inter-racial and inter-religious ac tivities which aim at bringing about better understanding between the different groups, making up the body politic in American life. One organization in particular, The National Conference of Jews and Christians, might be men tioned in this connection. Others are doing no less impor tant work. Another safety factor in the situation is the fact that the United States, is a country where democracy is passionately believed in, and that although it is sometimes spoken of as "a Christian country," and occasionally even as "a Pro testant country," it is, nevertheless, made up of many re ligious elements. This diversity in population prevents the type of homogeneity necessary for breeding racial, social, and religious bigotry which fertilize the soil for anti-Semitism. There is also an awareness on the part of at least the liberal and intelligent groups in American life that the greatness of the United States is not due to any one religious or cultural group but that all groups from all corners of the world have contributed to its development. There is an appreciation that would be difficult to find in other countries, of the con tribution which each cultural group can make toward the sum total of American culture. Indeed there are those who think of American culture as a fusion of the world cultures which have gone into the so-called "melting pot" and which have created the America of today.25 In addition to these must be mentioned the fact that there is no tradition of Jewish persecution in this country. Americans cannot forget that their country was founded and developed by those who sought to escape from religious persecution abroad. IV. IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION The day when the United States had a wide open door for immigrants is, it is feared, gone forever. While in a sense there has been some type of restriction of immigration for almost 100 years, real restriction did not begin until the adoption of the Quota Law in 1921.2(1 Whereas originally</page><page sequence="21">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 67 immigrant legislation aimed at protecting the immigrant, recent legislation aimed in the beginning, at selection and later almost exclusively at restriction. This new restrictive legislation had its origin in the social and economic condi tions of the country. Today, largely as a result of the prob lems which arose during the World War and the economic crisis since 1929, immigration into the United States is very limited. Officially and unofficially the government has been opposed to large immigration. In fact such quotas as exist have not been filled27 and efforts are being made in the Con gress, to reduce even existing limited quotas. Whether the restrictionist forces will be successful or not, there can be no denying the fact that large scale immigration into the United States is out of the question for the present and the immediate future. Despite this, government officials in the present administration have adopted a generous and liberal attitude regarding German refugees. Considerable numbers have come to the United States and are gradually adjusting themselves here. But opposition is heard from time to time and agitation has started against them. Occasionally one hears statements in the Congress of the United States to the effect that the traditional policy of this country being a refuge for those who are persecuted in other lands has been abandoned. No one who knows the situation can have much hope that the immigration policy of the U. S. will become less restrictive than it is now. On the contrary, the tendency is for more restriction, and it is likely that the next few years will see further restrictive legislation. This is largely due to the attitudes of what are sometimes called "100 percenters," those who have at other times been called the "Know-nothings" because of their distrust of and opposition to others than native Americans. But even liberal groups, such as organized labor, are opposed to im migration. This is because they view the opportunities in America as constantly diminishing. They believe, therefore, that immigrants coming to this country take the places which would otherwise go to unemployed Americans. The fact that so many millions of Americans have been unem ployed for a period of years, that even now, when the depres sion is easing, there are still between seven and eight million people unemployed, constitutes a powerful argument against</page><page sequence="22">68 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK a liberal immigration policy. This the labor groups and others are not reluctant to use. In the 45 years, between 1881 to 1935, there came to the United States nearly 28 million (27,787,792) immigrants, of whom almost two million (1,925,306) were Jews. Figures for the years 1908 to 1935, show that 4,339,244, or 34.33%, of the total immigration left the United States whereas only 55,695 Jews, or 5.08%, left the country in the same period. Studies of immigration and emigration proved conclusively that Jews came to the United States as per manent settlers and that they were but little influenced by economic conditions in this country either in their im migration or emigration.28 In recent years there was some emigration to Palestine, but the number of American Jews going there has been small. During the period of heavy Jewish immigration, a number of organizations came into being for the purpose of facilitât ing the immigrants' adjustment in this country. Chief among these are the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and the National Council of Jewish Women. Both organiza tions cooperate with similar groups in other countries, not ably the HICEM, so as to be of maximum help to the immi grant before arriving in this country. Once he is here, he may be aided, if he needs assistance, by either of the above organizations or by the local social service organizations. V. COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES, EDUCATION AND CIVIC PROTECTION I.I. For Religious Activities At first glance it appears as if chaos reigns in religious activities in the Jewish communities in the United States. Such, however, is not actually the case. Roughly speaking, observant Jews in the United States may be divided into three groups with respect to religious affiliation and prac tice. In the ascending order of their numerical strength they are as follows: (1) Reform Jews, those who are mem bers of reform temples where services have departed sub stantially from the traditional orthodox service, men and women sitting side by side, the men with bare heads,</page><page sequence="23">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 69 with mixed choirs and organ music, and among whom Sabbath observance is the exception rather than the rule. Some of these temples hold their services on Sundays in an effort to attract the men who are usually in business on Saturday. (2) The Conservative Group, those who have departed in some measure from the traditional services but have not gone to the extent of the Reformed. One section of this group, now being referred to as the "Recon structionists," revere traditional practices not so much because they are commanded by God, but because they are part of the Jewish folkways and mores, and hold that to adhere to them is to indicate one's connection with the Jewish people. (3) The third group consists of the Orthodox, those who adhere strictly to the traditional faith and forms of observance. There are a number of Jews in this country who have no particular religious affiliation during the entire year. Dur ing the High Holydays many attend the existing synagogues and temples by purchasing seats for the occasion, while others attend services in improvised synagogues usually located in public meeting places and, occasionally, even in dance halls, rented for the period and the occasion as com mercial ventures by individuals and organizations. The people attending these services are mostly Orthodox in background. Many of the religiously unaffiliated Jews use other means of identification with the Jewish people, such as membership in charitable organizations, cultural clubs, fraternal organizations, etc., and affiliation with Zionism or other Jewish movements. In each of these groups may be found a large variety of divergent views, practices and forms of religious observance. The lines of demarcation between them are not always sharp and are at best arbitrary. It is not definitely known how many synagogues, temples and other houses of worship there are in the United States. It is estimated that The Union of American Hebrew Con gregations, representing the reform or liberal group, has approximately 290 temples, with a total membership of about 50,000. The temple brotherhoods, subsidiary organ ization of the Union, have a total membership of approx imately 20,000. The temple sisterhoods, of which there are</page><page sequence="24">70 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK about 350, have a total membership of about 70,000. The Union spends approximately one-half million dollars on its activities. This includes the budget of the Hebrew Union College, which trains reform Rabbis.2' The United Synagogue of America represents the con servative group. Approximately 250 synagogues affiliated with this organization, and about the same number of unaffi liated synagogues, have a total membership of about 75,000. It has a Women's League comprising 280 organizations, with a total membership of about 40,000. Its Brotherhoods have about 100 individual organizations with a total mem bership of about 10,000. There are approximately 250 organizations in its Young People's League, which is the youth organization, with a total membership of about 30,000.3030,000.30 The Orthodox groups are not nearly as well organized as are the other two, although they, too, have a central organization, The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. It is almost impossible to get any definite information with respect to either the number of synagogues or their member ships. Moreover, they are much less united with respect to policy of religious observance and practice. Thus, whereas each of the other two groups has a central organization, with its representative rabbinical seminary and rabbinical conference, the Orthodox group has several seminaries and several rabbinical conferences. There is no safe way of estimating the number of Jewish individuals who are affiliated with synagogues. On the basis of the above figures it might be said that no more than between 300,000 and 350,000 men and women are directly and actively connected with synagogues. However, since a member is usually the head of the family and the other members are assumed to have affiliation by virtue of such membership, it may be said that between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 are associated with religious organizations and activity. It should be added that a study of Jewish Congregations in the United States, made in 1927, showed that there were 3,118 permanent congregations in the U. S. The total mem bership was not reported, but 1,290 congregations reported a total expenditure during the previous fiscal year of $18,</page><page sequence="25">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 71 001,771. Also, 2,348 of the congregations reported the total value of their buildings was $155,744,666.31 This is by no means the total expenditure for religious activity by the Jews in the United States. Each of the three groups mentioned above, carries on its educational activities through its central organization. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations conducts educational activities of a national and local type. It has a close relationship with the Hebrew Union College which trains the reform rabbis, who have an organization of their own, the Central Conference of American Rabbis. It has a comparatively large organization for educational purposes in and outside of the temples, including preparation of text books for the Sunday Schools, Regional Conferences,•stim ulation of their temple brotherhoods and sisterhoods, etc. The United Synagogue of America performs similar func tions for the conservative group, with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America as the educational institution for training conservative Rabbis, whose alumni are organized in the Rabbinical Assembly of America. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America aims to per form the same services with the limitations noted above. Though not as intimately related to the organization, the YeshivaYeshiva College and the Isaac Elchanan Seminary trains Rabbis for this group. There are several other seminaries for training Orthodox Rabbis. There is another, independent institution for the training of reform Rabbis, The Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City. There are no central funds for maintaining religious institutions wrhether synagogues or seminaries. The former are usually supported by membership fees and donations of members; the latter, by endowment funds and special gifts. Each synagogue, able to afford it, usually maintains its own rabbi. Smaller communities sometimes have itin erant rabbis who conduct services and perform other rab binical functions as necessary. Some of the very small communities have one person who serves in the capacity of rabbi, sholaet (one who is empowered to perform the ritual slaughter of cattle and poultry), mohel (one who is authorized</page><page sequence="26">72 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK to perform the religious rite of circumcision), and Hebrew teacher. Some rabbis have created for themselves positions of out standing leadership in their respective communities. In general, it may be said that the synagogue looks to the Rabb'i to be not only its spiritual guide and to superintend the religious education of the children, to administer the affairs of the congregation, and to conduct the necessary rabbinical functions at births, marriages, deaths, etc., but to be its representative in the general community. Rabbis are, therefore, prominent in civic, religious, philanthropic, and other communal affairs, Jewish and non-Jewish. In a number of instances, rabbis have taken leading parts in social reform movements in their respective communities. 2. Education A. Secular Education.—The Jews in the United States send their children to the public elementary, secondary and higher schools. There are comparatively few Jewish paro chial schools. In this way, Jewish children are trained from an early date to feel at home with their non-Jewish neighbors and are brought up to full participation in American cultural life. As indicated elsewhere, the Jews have a relatively high proportion of attendance in all educational institutions, from the elementary school to the university and technical and professional schools. A study, now in progress, by the B'nai B'rith, of the Jewish students in 1319 colleges and universities throughout the land, shows that of 1,148,393 students, 104,906, or 9.13%, are Jews. In other words, the Jewish population which constitutes 3.58% of the general population, con tributes 9.13% of the students in the higher educational institutions. The Jewish students range from 1.2% in the mountain states to 49.6% in New York City, where the Jewish population is 29.6% of the total population.32 There are no universities, technical or professional schools, outside of several seminaries, a college for Hebrew and cognate learning, and a school for social workers, under Jewish auspices.33 Various attempts have been made from</page><page sequence="27">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 73 time to time to encourage the organization of such institu tions but they have always met with such resistance that nothing came of them. About ten years ago the Yeshivah College was organized. But this is closely connected with the Orthodox Seminary and is in reality a parochial school. B. Jewish Education.—Jewish education was always more or less informal, was always partly affiliated with the syn agogue, and was always considered a responsibility of the community. The attitude of Jewish parents toward the education of their children, particularly their male children, is well known. Talmud Torahs were among the most favored organizations in the Jewish community and the education of poor children was considered a primary obligation on each community from time immemorial.34 In this country the traditional attitudes toward Jewish education, more or less religious, developed the traditional types of Jewish educational institutions, such as the Talmud Torah (acorn munal Hebrew School originally intended for poor children), and the Heder (a private Hebrew School). With the develop ment of the public school and with compulsory universal education, the Talmud Torah and the traditional private teacher were seriously challenged. The dissatisfactions with these institutions were responsible, in part, for the creation of Sunday Schools connected with the synagogues. It be came the practice of each reform temple and, later, of the more progressive conservative synagogues, to maintain schools which held classes on Sunday mornings for the religious education of the children whose parents were mem bers of the congregations. Opinions differ as to the effec tiveness of these schools, of which there are large numbers in the United States and which provide some kind of Jewish education for children who might otherwise receive none. It was not until 1910 that a movement, sponsored by a small group under the leadership of a few idealists, developed a modern Jewish educational program. This development was at a very rapid pace, so that practically every one of the larger Jewish communities had a fairly comprehensive program of Jewish education by the end of the third decade of the present century. As a result of this movement, the old Hebrew School and Talmud Torah, frequently located in dingy, dark, unattractive quarters, gave way, in many</page><page sequence="28">74 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK instances, to modern schools, located in attractive, airy and sunny rooms, with college-trained men and women as teachers, with a curriculum which aims at transmitting to the pupils the Jewish cultural heritage.33 These systems of Jewish education in the larger com munities are usually part of the Federations of Jewish Chari ties. They are aided by boards of Jewish education which supervise and finance, in part or in whole, the Jewish educa tional institutions which aim to provide at least a minimum of Jewish education for Jewish youth. Hebrew schools, Hebrew high schools, teachers institutes, and colleges of Jewish studies, sprang up in the different communities. The old type Melamed (Hebrew teacher) is rapidly passing from the scene. Men and women born and educated in America, graduates of American colleges and universities, with grad uate work in the best teachers colleges and universities, entered the classrooms and became the supervisors of the Jewish educational systems. A resurgence of, and a revival of interest in, Jewish education made themselves felt through out the country and permeated the Jewish communities and Jewish community activity. Like every revival movement it has its friends and enemies. Some see in it a deviation from orthodox forms and practices and are, therefore, op posed to it. Others see in it an intensification of Jewish life which seems to them opposed to Americanization as they conceive it. They, too, are opposed to it. Between these two extremes, is a group of persons, usually the conserva tive elements in the Jewish community, who look upon it as a worthwhile movement from which will emerge the type of Jewish education best adapted to the American scene and which will meet the needs of American Jewry. There is no exact information as to how many Jewish children receive a Jewish education. Estimates vary from 20% to 40%. A recent estimate,36 is to the effect that of 800,000 Jewish children of school age, only 25% attend Jewish schools. Of these, 55% attend week-day schools; 37.5% attend Sunday Schools; 6% attend private week-day schools; 1.5% attend parochial schools. The same authority estimates that approximately $5,825,000 is spent annually on Jewish education. Of this sum, about 71% comes from tuition fees; 17% comes from local philanthropic funds,</page><page sequence="29">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 75 such as Federations of Jewish Charities; 12% from central communal, national, or Seminary funds. A different study estimates that about one-third of the children enrolled con tinue until graduation.37 The problems facing Jewish education in this country are: (1) inadequate funds, it having been estimated that adequate Jewish education would require almost as much money as all the other Jewish communal activities put together; (2) lack of time, since most of the pupils attend the public schools and there is very little time or energy left for Jewish education; (3) suitable curricula; (4) lack of a real and sustained interest on the part of leaders and parents in a comprehensive Jewish educational program; (5) lack of a universally acceptable philosophy as to the aim and content of Jewish education in the United States.38 There are a number of institutions throughout the coun try for training teachers for the Jewish schools. Usually each large community has its own teacher-training school. The best known of these are the schools located in New York City, Boston, and Chicago. There exists a National Council for Jewish Education made up of the leaders of the Jewish educational movement throughout the country which which issues Jewish Education, a quarterly journal, and which which holds annual meetings for the discussion of common problems. There are also several organizations of Jewish teachers and principals, somewhat in the nature of trade unions. One very interesting enterprise in Jewish education is that comprising the Yiddish schools for children. The language of instruction is Yiddish and the point of view is liberal, in many instances, socialistic. They aim at training the children in what they term the language of their parents. This movement is about three decades old and has a great many useful and worthwhile achievements to its credit. It It is estimated that there are more than 300 Yiddish schools in the United States and that they have a total enrollment of of 21,000 children.39 The depression, with the consequent shortage of funds and the urge to reduce expenditures where possible, has tended to focus attention and criticism upon the Jewish</page><page sequence="30">76 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK education movement as one of the non-essentials and not belonging by right to the Jewish community as represented by the Federation of Jewish Charities. This is the situation in which Jewish education finds itself at the present time. Its progress has been halted. In many instances it has lost ground. Whether it will recapture its position, whether it will continue to develop along its former lines and rate of progress, only the future can tell.40 3. Civic Protection There are four organizations in the United States con cerned with the problem of protection of Jewish rights in this country and abroad. They are: The American Jewish Committee, The American Jewish Congress, The Anti Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, and The Jewish Labor Committee. The American Jewish Committee was organized in 1906 with the avowed purpose "to safeguard the civil and religious rights of Jews, to combat discrimination and allay pre judice, to aid victims of persecution and calamity." Its activities cover all countries where Jews reside and where there are evidences of anti-Semitic activities. A large portion of its efforts are devoted to the dissemination of educational literature, aiming to combat anti-Semitism in the United States. More recently, its major activities have been concerned with exposing Nazi propaganda in this country and elsewhere and fighting anti-Jewish discrimina tion here. Because of its many and varied contacts with government officials here and abroad, as well as with civic organizations, individuals and religious bodies in other countries, it is enabled to carry on an effective world-wide activity. Its publications are widely distributed and it exercises important influence directly and indirectly on public opinion in this country and elsewhere. While in its Jewish orientation it is anti-nationalistic, it is definitely pro-Palestine. Some of its most prominent leaders are also leading non-Zionist members of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. The Committee as such is pledged to cooperate "with those who, attracted by religious or historic associa tion, shall seek to establish in Palestine a center for Judaism,</page><page sequence="31">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 77 for the stimulation of our faith, for the pursuit and develop ment of literature, science and art in a Jewish environment, and for the rehabilitation of the land."41 Its financial sup port comes mainly from its members, donations, and appro priations from federations and welfare funds throughout the country. The American Jewish Congress, a successor to an earlier body of the same name, was organized in 1922. The first American Jewish Congress was organized in 1918 for the purpose of naming a commission to the Peace Conference at Versailles. That Congress was a temporary body with which the American Jewish Committee and other national organizations were affiliated. It was set up on the basis of a written agreement which provided that it should go out of existence after the Peace Treaty was signed. Its com mission played an important role in bringing about the inclusion of the minority rights clauses in the peace Treaties. This Congress adjourned sine die in 1920, in accordance with the written agreement reached before the Congress was convened, and after accepting the report of the commission which had been sent to the Peace Conference. It was not until two years later that the present Congress was organized. Although its leaders claim that it is a "dem ocratic organization," there is no record of a popular or democratic election since its organization.42 Its purposes are practically the same as those of the American Jewish Com mittee, except that, in its aims at dealing with the civic, political, economic and religious rights of the Jews in all lands, it is nationalistically motivated. Some of its leaders are also the most prominent leaders in Zionist activities. They are also the leaders in the World Jewish Congress movement. In general its form of organization is similar to that of the American Jewish Committee. It also has an executive committee and various other standing com mittees. However, there are branches of the Congress in a number of cities in the United States. It differs fundamen tally from the American Jewish Committee in sponsoring mass activities, such as protests against the present German government, a boycott against German-made goods, and</page><page sequence="32">78 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK mass meetings. Its funds come from its members, and from federations and welfare funds. The B'nai B'rith, a fraternal organization with branches throughout the world, carries on its program of civic pro tec tion largely through its Anti-Defamation League. This League was organized in 1913 for the purpose of stimulating good-will and combating anti-Semitism. The League has concentrated its activities on watching the press, the stage, the screen, radio, school texts, etc. It carries on an educa tional program through the dissemination of books and pamphlets, and by providing speakers for suitable occasions. The income of the Anti-Defamation League comes from the exchequer of the B'nai B'rith, which in turn receives its income from membership fees. More recently because of its intensified activity and enlarged program, the B'nai B'rith has undertaken wider campaigns for funds. It also receives funds from the federations and welfare funds.43 The Jewish Labor Committee, organized only in 1934, has in general the same purposes as the other three organ izations. However, it differs from the others in its orientation and in its approach. Because of its contacts and affiliations with labor organizations, more particularly the American Federation of Labor, it has been helpful in furthering and ef fectuating the anti-Nazi boycott. It is maintained with funds coming from its membership and central labor organizations.44 These four organizations, though having practically the same purpose, are responsible to different sections in the community, although there is some overlapping in the memberships. In general it may be said that the Amer ican Jewish Committee, made up as it is of the upper eco nomic strata of the Jewish population, is responsible to them for its policies and procedures. The American Jewish Con gress is made up very largely of representatives of the middle class and is responsible to them for its activities. The B'nai B'rith is composed mainly of the middle class and profes sional group and its policies are set by them. The Jewish Labor Committee has its own constituency. It is safe to say, therefore, that whereas the four organizations together probably constitute a cross-section of the entire Jewish population in the United States, no one organization is com pletely or fully representative.</page><page sequence="33">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 79 The differences in orientation and methods of work which characterize these organizations give rise to frequent con flicts which, in the opinion of many, weaken the Jewish community. Demands are heard from time to time for unity or at least a united front.45 Many are of the opinion, however, that unity is neither possible nor desirable. There is a Joint Consultative Council made up of representatives from the different organizations, which discusses common problems and endeavors to formulate common procedures. In some instances, where all organizations cannot agree on a common policy, two or more may unite. Mention should perhaps also be made here of two addi tional protective organizations. One of these is the Non Sectarian Anti-Nazi League, of which a number of Jewish organizations and individuals are members. The other is a Jewish protective organization maintained by the Com munist Party. But neither of these two organizations has the standing in the Jewish community that the other four have attained. VI. ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE NEEDY, THE SICK, DEPENDENT CHILDREN, AND THE AGED Before proceeding to discuss the different types of organ izations functioning in the Jewish community in the social service sphere, it may be well to obtain a birds-eye view of the extent and cost of these activities. It has been estimated that there are more than 4,000 communal agencies receiving financial support from central funds. These agencies spend approximately $50,000,000 annually in serving the sick; the poor; the widows; orphans; the maladjusted; the educational, cultural and recreational needs; needy Jews overseas; and the upbuilding of Pal estine. Table 10 presents a distribution of these expendi tures. It will be observed that about 85% is spent by agencies serving the needs in their respective localities or communities; about 5% is spent by national or regional agencies in this country; about 7% is spent by overseas agencies and 2J^% is spent in the administrationjof the agencies which raise these large sums.</page><page sequence="34">80 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK TABLE 10 Expenditures of Local, National and Overseas Jewish Social Agencies in 1935■•6 Disbursements Field and Type of Service Agencies Amount Percent 1.

With this introduction, we can now turn to a considéra tion of the more formal types of organizations which have been created to meet these needs. Before doing so, how ever, it may be well to explain that the more extensive discussion including the historical background in the section immediately following, that 011 poverty and dependency, is due to the belief that this type of social work is typical of and basic to the others. This is the reason also for the more detailed discussion of the problems faced by the family</page><page sequence="35">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 81 agencies in the sections on trends and tendencies (p. 127ff.). For the same reason emphasis is laid on the developments in New York City. It would make the treatment much too complex and confusing if the developments in the other cities were to be described in any reasonable detail. A. Poverty or Dependency Great progress has been made in provisions for the care of the poor in the Jewish communities of the United States. There are many organizations, usually referred to as "family care agencies," for aiding Jewish families and individuals who need financial and other types of assistance in order to maintain themselves or reacquire an independent status. This type of social service, together with health care to be discussed later, frequently required the major portion of the funds collected by the federations of Jewish charities. So that this field of Jewish social work in the United States may be viewed in its proper perspective, and may serve as an introduction to the other fields to be discussed, it is necessary to review briefly some of the traditional attitudes among Jews regarding the care of the poor and needy which gave rise to this development. The thoughtful and considerate care of the poor has ever been foremost in the attention of Jewish communities and their leaders throughout the ages. As a result of the attitudes in the Bible and the forms and practices of charity outlined in the Talmud,47 institutions and practices grew up in the Jewish communities which left an indelible imprint upon the Jew regarding his responsibility for his less fortunate brother. Charity became a living guide to one's relation to his fellow man and permeated and controlled one's daily life. In the Codifications, which are still the guides to Jewish social and religious practices with large portions of the Jewish population, charity and charitable acts hold a most important place. The Code of Maimonides, who lived in the 12th and 13th centuries, gives an interesting series of grades or values in charitable giving. The first and lowest degree of charity consists of giving to the poor but only after much pressure; the second is giving in a kindly spirit but less than one's means allow; the third consists of giving</page><page sequence="36">82 AMERICAN' JEWISH YEAR BOOK directly directly to the poor after being solicited; the fourth is giving before one is asked and directly to the poor; the fifth, when the donor does not know the recipient but the recipient knows knows the donor; the sixth grade is when the donor knows the recipient but the latter does not know the donor; the seventh is that type of giving which makes it impossible for the donor to know the recipient or the recipient the donor; the eighth and highest type of charity is that which enables the poor to become self-supporting either through loans or business business establishment or finding employment. Jewish social agencies in America today, though perhaps unconsciously, are are striving to live up to the highest of the eight grades of charity.charity. The self-support departments of family care agen cies, which enable dependent families to become self-sup porting through the purchase of businesses of various types are clearly engaging in the highest type of charity;48 Federa tions which make it impossible for the donor and recipient to know each other act strictly in accord, though perhaps for entirely different reasons, with the principles of sound philanthropic practice laid down by the famous Jewish philosopher more than seven hundred years ago. In addition to this very rich and compelling background of Jewish charitable practice, there grew up the feeling on the part of the Jews throughout the ages that the welfare of the group is inextricably interwoven with the welfare of the individual. This was especially borne in on them dur ing the Middle Ages when, because of persecutions, expul sions, and discriminations, it became necessary for the Jewish communities and individuals to protect other Jews insofar as possible. Jewish communities had to prepare themselves as best they could to receive wandering Jews. Shelters had to be established and arrangements made for meeting all of the other needs of the wanderers, since the Jewish poor could neither apply for nor receive aid from the general community. The self-government of the Jewish group also necessitated communal provisions for the com plete care of the needy so that the seven branches of Jewish charity mentioned in the Rabbinic literature were, and still are, fully provided for. These are: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, burying the dead and comforting the mourners, redeeming the captives, educating</page><page sequence="37">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 83 the fatherless and sheltering the homeless, and providing poor maidens with dowries. It would be difficult to over-emphasize the importance which the Jewish communities during the Middle Ages at tached to the care of the poor, the orphan, the stranger and the captive. The Biblical and Talmudic admonitions were observed in spirit and letter with the utmost scrupulousness. Communities vied with each other in the generosity which they showered upon some of these unfortunates. To be an orphan or a widow was to be in a privileged position in the Jewish community. For they stood, in accordance with the Biblical teachings, under the special protection of God, Himself. The foremost Jewish humorist, Sholem Aleichem, who described Jewish life with rare skill and insight, epit omized the attitude of the Jew toward the orphan by begin ning one of his most important books with the statement, "I am lucky, I am an orphan." No less kind was the Jewish community to the Jewish wanderer. The age-old custom of "guest for the Sabbath" typifies the attitude in this re gard. These attitudes and practices take on special signif icance when they are compared with the practices among non-Jews of the same and later periods. Compare, for instance, the degrees of charity of Maimonides and the solicitude of the Jewish community for the welfare of wan derers, with the English Poor Law which, in the middle of the sixteenth century, punished wanderers and vagabonds by branding them with the letter "V," assigned them as slaves to those who would claim them, fed them with "bread and water and refuse meat," branded them with the letter "S""S" on the cheek and enslaved them for life if they escaped during the first year, and put them to death as felons if they they escaped again I49 It was the practice in Jewish communities, from time immemorial, for the best and most prominent people to interest themselves in charitable activities. Josephus tells us that, in the first century, when Palestine was stricken with a famine, Queen Helena of Adiabene sent shiploads of food to the foremost men of Jerusalem so that they might distribute it among the people. During the Middle Ages,</page><page sequence="38">AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK only the very finest members of the Jewish community were selected as "gabbaei tsedakah" or overseers of the poor. So honored were these latter that a son of such an overseer was eligible to marry into a priestly family without the usual inquiry as to the purity of his descent.50 This was the background for the development of Jewish philanthropy in the United States. Traditional practices of two thousand years were transported to these shores and became no less a part of the social practices of the early Jewish settlers on the new continent than they were in the Old World. In addition to this traditional heritage was the realization from the very beginning of Jewish sojourn in the new land, that the responsibility of Jew for Jew was to hold true no less here than in European countries. The very first group of Jews that settled in New Netherlands in 1654, the twenty-seven persons who came here on the "St. Charles," found that several of their number were to be held as hostages for the payment of passage by the rest of them. Similarly, the unwillingness of Governor Stuyvesant of New Amsterdam (now New York City), to let them remain here was directed not against any one of them but against the entire group. (It may be worth men tioning in this connection that the common belief, which has been frequently cited as the reason for the existence of separate Jewish charities in the United States, that these early settlers promised to take care of. their own poor as a condition for being permitted to remain, is not quite true. Although the Dutch West India Co. named such a condition, there is no evidence that Stuyvesant tried to impose it or that the Jewish settlers accepted it.)51 When one fought for rights and won them, they were won for the group, even as discriminations against one tended to become practices against all. It may be doubted, however, whether Jewish philanthropy would have developed as it has in the United States if there had not been the enormous increase in population during the nineteenth century. As we have seen, it has been esti mated that by 1825 there were approximately only 6,000 Jews in the United States. In the following century the population grew to almost four and one-half million, an increase of over 700%. This increase was largely due to</page><page sequence="39">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 85 immigration, mainly from Germany between 1825 and 1880, and from East-European countries between 1880 and 1925. The hundreds of thousands of immigrants since 1880 made it necessary for the earlier settlers to create conditions and agencies which would facilitate the adjustment of the newcomers to the new environment. Those who came here before 1880, notably the German Jews, though at first con siderably disturbed by the avalanche of Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and Roumania, soon recalled, directly or indirectly, their own experiences and their own trials and tribulations during their persecutions, thirty or forty years earlier, and quickly responded to the needs of the moment by creating the necessary facilities for meeting the problems which the newcomers faced. Prior to 1800, Jewish communal activity in New York City and the rest of the United States was largely connected with with the synagogue. In 1822, as a result of the request of a Jewish veteran of the Revolutionary War that he be visited in the hospital in New *York City where he was confined, the Hebrew Benevolent Society of New York was organized. This society, ostensibly created in order to administer a fund of $300 left after the death of this veteran, later de veloped into the United Hebrew Charities, now the Jewish Social Service Association of New York City, the largest Jewish organization of its kind in the world. But even before this, stirrings were noticeable in the larger Jewish settle ments, particularly in New York City, for the creation of organizations outside of the synagogue for meeting the needs in the Jewish communities which made themselves felt. In New York City, there were at the beginning of the nineteenth century such organizations as a "Female Hebrew Benevolent Society," a "Society for the Education of Orphan Children and the Relief of Indigent Persons," and an agency for the care of unemployed and the prevention of depen dency, an agricultural society, and a number of others. By 1853, The Hebrew Benevolent Society of New York City was aiding 1,200 applicants annually; in 1856 it aided almost 1,900 applicants. On these it spent approximately $5,000 a year. While this may seem a rather small sum today, it should be remembered that there were only between 15,000 and 20,000 Jews in New York City at the</page><page sequence="40">86 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK time. All of the societies then existing aided between 4,000 and 5,000 persons annually. This, of course, makes the problem of dependency appear as much more serious at that time than it is today. For, even allowing for duplications, it may be conservatively estimated that between 10% and 20% of the Jewish population received assistance from one organization or another. Were this true today, all of the money collected by the Jewish Federation of New York City would not suffice for the needs of this one activity. This was, no doubt, due to the fairly recent immigration of German Jews resulting from the discriminations and persecutions which followed the Napoleonic wars and con tinued through the period from 1830 to 1848. The German Jewish immigrants were no more satisfied with the administration of this organization, which was largely in the hands of the earlier settlers, the Portuguese, than were the Russian immigrants satisfied with the way the Germans conducted their organizations toward the close of the century. In 1844 "The German Hebrew Benevolent Society" was organized, no doubt as a protest against the methods of the Hebrew Benevolent Society. This Society seems to have been very popular. During the first year it had more than 200 members. Sixteen years later (1860) these two organizations combined as a result of public pressure against duplication52 and formed the United Hebrew Charities. In 1881 there began the Jewish exodus from Eastern Europe which brought in its wake problems, the magnitude of which challenged the Jewish community of New York and other cities, as never before or since. It seemed to the leaders of the society that the United Hebrew Charities (and the same was true in the other port communities), would be diverted from its original purpose of "distributing relief among needy Hebrews in New York City to the care of Jewish immigrants." At first the organization was alarmed and stated that its function was "to care for the needy of New York City and not of the world." It more or less ap proved the protective immigration acts of 1882; it sent letters of protest to European leaders and to the press urging more discriminating and more careful selection of immi grants. As the immigration flow continued to increase, the</page><page sequence="41">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 87 leaders of the Society and indeed of New York Jewry, real ized that the time had come for constructive action. They placed an agent at Ellis Island, the port of entry in New York City, to help the immigrants; they opposed the depor tation of dependents; they cooperated with the recently formed Union of American Hebrew Congregations, later the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society for the Care of Immi grants; they established a temporary shelter; and in other ways devised measures and facilities for adjusting the newly arrived immigrants.53 The extent of the work of the United Hebrew Charities, which is an indication of the magnitude of the problem faced also in other cities during the years that followed, may be gained from a few figures. In 1882, 300 people received transportation to other cities; in 1883, 1,040 people; in 1892, 4,030 people received transportation with an approximate annual expenditure of $25,000 for railroad fees. In 1882 the total expenditures of the Society were $55,000; in 1883, $90,000. But the work and expenditures continued to mount; more than 600 requests for assistance were received in a single day and more than 8,000 unemployed persons were helped by this organization in 1896. It organized industrial schools for boys and girls; it was largely instru mental in organizing a home for chronic invalids; it was the first to establish a visiting nurses service ; it started an exper iment for colonizing Jewish immigrants; it established a legal aid society; it organized the Central Russian Refugee Committee in 1890. It became, in a word, the prime mover of various communal activities to assist the residents as well as the newly arrived immigrants.54 These activities continued during the twentieth century so that in 1929, before the depression set in, this society spent more than half a million dollars in the care of depen dent and maladjusted families. In 1932, it spent approx imately a million and a quarter dollars, a substantial share of which came from the general community. Professionally this organization and other similar organ izations throughout the country developed just as signif icantly. From a relief society, with the poor coming to the office, standing in line for a mere pittance, it has developed into an organization where families are maintained on a</page><page sequence="42">AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK respectable level, are helped to self-support through voca tional retraining, through establishment in business, through education and training of their children, and in various other ways. This Society and the other Jewish family societies have developed standard family budgets and pro vide their families with a monthly or weekly allowance, carefully calculated to meet their requirements. The atti tude of these agencies, their approach and spirit, have developed beyond recognition. They strive as hard as they can to maintain the self-respect of the poor, now known as their "clients." Carefully trained staffs of visitors, usually college and university graduates, and in some cases graduates of professional schools of social work, supervise these families and aim to develop in them constructive forces. Since 1920, when the Jewish Aid Society of Chicago changed its name to the Jewish Social Service Bureau of Chicago,55 most of the larger Jewish agencies in the country, including the United Hebrew Charities of New York City, have similarly changed their names. Instead of Jewish charities and Jewish relief relief relief societies, one now finds Jewish social service bureaus or associations in every city with any substantial Jewish pop ulation. The change is not merely one of name ; it is a change in outlook, point of view, method, and philosophy. Instead of "relief work" we now have "case work," the latter being placed more and more on the basis of fundamental scientific knowledge provided in the social and psychological sciences. One of the major problems facing these agencies as well as the non-Jewish agencies functioning in this field, is how to utilize, in the case work process, the existing knowledge in the social sciences, and how to develop the necessary knowledge not yet available.56 It is generally recognized by social scientists that those working with human beings must be equipped not only with the general social sciences but also with an adequate knowledge of the cultural background of the people whom they desire to guide and influence. This is especially true with respect to the Jewish group.57 What is needed, therefore, is the development of a sociology and social psychology of the Jewish group.58 Unfortunately, this type of knowledge is not yet in existence. There is a popular misconception regarding the functions and activities of family agencies. It is commonly believed</page><page sequence="43">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 89 that they are mainly relief societies whose primary purpose is to provide financial assistance to those who are in need of such aid. Actually, financial relief is only a small although perhaps the most costly aspect of their work. Only between 4% and 40% of the situations dealt with by these agencies require or receive monetary aid. And even these present other problems which require expert treatment because, not infrequently, these problems are the real cause of the financial need. No situation or difficulty is outside their scope. This was true at least until recently, when some of these agencies changed their policies with respect to the type of situations they would undertake to treat. But it is still true that most of the family agencies will accept almost all problems that human "flesh is heir to." Whether it is conflict between husband and wife, parents and children, children and their schools and other environmental agencies, industrial maladjustment, physical and mental illness, or just plain unanalyzed poverty, the family agency and the family case worker will most likely undertake to render service. In the larger communities there are special agencies for treating some of the more difficult problems requiring special skill or special equipment or both. But the family agency is frequently the hopper which first receives all the problems and difficulties which are then distributed by it to those agencies which are organized to deal with them.59 Some of these developments were in line with those that took place in the non-Jewish agencies. The contribution of the Jewish agencies, however, lies not so much in a dif ferent type of work although that is the case especially in the forms of self-support already mentioned, as in the quality, intensity and standards of work. Jewish agencies in New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore, and in other cities maintain their families on a very much higher per capita allowance than do the non-Jewish agencies. Before the depression, they were much more discriminating in accept ing public relief for their clients than the non-Jewish agencies because of the comparatively low standards of work in the public agencies. They also give greater recognition, im plicitly and explicitly, to the differences due to culture, psychological makeup, and inherent potentialities of their</page><page sequence="44">90 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK • clients. In these ways they have made an important con trihution to the development of general social work. While the quality of work is uneven among the different societies in the various cities, the better known Jewish societies are among the leaders in their respective cities. Many Many of the agencies changed some of their policies and practices during the depression, and are, as a result, much more like the non-Jewish agencies than they were before the depression. This is borne out by figures recently pub lished by the Russell Sage Foundation of New York City, based on information collected by the Foundation from 56 non-Jewish and Jewish family societies throughout the country country over a period of more than 11 years. They indicate that such differences as existed between Jewish and non Jewish family agencies before the depression, with respect to to conditions and standards of work including family al lowances and the basis for granting assistance, are rapidly disappearing. The effect of these changes will be discussed in in a later connection (see pp. 127-135). The depression, which began in 1929, and which has con tinued for seven years, placed an exceedingly heavy burden upon the Jewish family societies, of which there are approx imately 100. In 1930, 39 of the largest Jewish family agencies in the country cared for approximately 25,000 Jewish families. In 1931 they took care of about 29,000. In 1932 and 1933 they cared for about 31,000 families. How ever, in 1934, because of the development of the state and federal relief programs, the load upon Jewish family societies was reduced to about 23,000. This reduction has continued until the current year, when because of a change of policy on the part of the Federal Government, Jewish societies are again called upon to care for larger numbers. But the problem has as yet nowhere reached the proportions of 1932 or 1933. The expenditures during this period kept pace with the load. Thus in 1929, the 34 largest Jewish family agencies which supplied information spent approximately two mil lion dollars. In 1930 they spent about $2,130,000; in 1931 about $2.900,000; in 1932 and 1933, about four million dol</page><page sequence="45">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 91 lars for each year; in 1934 about $2,390,000; and in 1935, $1,716,000. All of the Jewish family service agencies of which there is record, spent about $4,200,000 in 1935 (See p. 80). In 1929 and 1930, the same agencies reported a clientele of between 4000 and 4500 families per month requiring financial assistance. In 1931 they aided about 6350 families per month; in 1932 about 9450 families; in 1933, 10,500; in 1934, 6300 families; and in 1935 about 4950. It required about 400 professional social workers to handle this load.60 Family Service agencies also care for various types of behavior problems, more especially among boys and girls. These problems are usually treated by the best trained workers. In New York City there is a special organization, the Jewish Board of Guardians, which has a large and espe daily trained staff for caring for these problems. It also maintains two institutions, one for problem boys and one for problem girls, near New York City. These are the only institutions of their kind maintained by Jews.61 In this connection it should be mentioned that there is no reliable information regarding Jewish juvenile and adult delinquency in the United States. Such limited studies as have been made indicate that Jews have less than their numerical proportion of criminals. It is also known that there are important differences in the number and kinds of crimes. Thus, Jews commit very few crimes against the person. Jews also have less than their proportion of juvenile delinquency. There are more delinquents among boys than among girls, and the sentences for girls are much more severe than for boys. But this is due to the greater protectiveness of parents of their daughters. It is only the girl that is absolutely unmanageable who finds her way into court.62 What the future of this type of Jewish social work is, nobody knows. It will depend entirely upon the programs of the Federal and State Governments with respect to relief and social security. These programs are at the present time being reconsidered and no one knows what the outcome will be.</page><page sequence="46">92 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK B. Health Care The care of the Jewish sick is in many respects dependent upon the developments in general health care. Methods for for treating various types of diseases must be developed in the general field, especially since, with the exception of amaurotic family idiocy and Burger's disease, to which Jews are peculiarly predisposed, and diabetes, which has a greater incidence among Jews than among non-Jews, there seems to be no special Jewish health problem requir ing special treatment. Even tuberculosis, which is com monly assumed to be a serious problem among Jews, has in reality a much lower incidence among Jews than in the rest of the white population.63 However, a number of Jewish hospitals have come to rank among the foremost in the country, and are doing a great deal, not only for the Jewish sick, but for the non-Jewish as well. Although many questions have been raised as to the need or desirability of separate Jewish hospitals, especially since they care for substantial numbers of non-Jewish sick and Jews frequently use non-Jewish hospitals, there is a large body of opinion that Jewish hospitals are essential for the Jewish patient as well as for the Jewish physician. It is fairly well agreed that the Jewish patient is nowhere as comfortable as in a Jewish hospital, whether it be "kosher" or not, and hence is best placed there. Similarly, Jewish physicians and Jewish graduates of medical schools need Jewish hospitals because they find it almost impossible to get interneships and appoint ments in non-Jewish hospitals. Without hospital facilities the physician is not only helpless in the treatment of disease, but is bound to deteriorate as a practitioner. Inefficient and unethical practices on the part of Jewish physicians react unfavorably not only upon the Jewish patient, but upon the Jewish community as well. It is for these and other reasons that Jewish communities throughout the country have established Jewish hospitals, occasionally jeopardizing the rest of their social service program, because of the heavy drain which hospitals usually are on the community exchequer. Jewish health care in the United States has in general kept pace with the growth of the Jewish population. The</page><page sequence="47">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 93 largest Jewish hospital in the United States is admittedly the Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, which was ded icated as "The Jews' Hospital" in 1855 and, except for a Jewish hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, organized in 1850, was the first large Jewish hospital in this country. The progress, which Jewish health care has made since the organization; of these two hospitals can best be appreciated by a consider ation of what the Mt. Sinai Hospital, now one of the largest in the country, was in 1855. Although even at that time it was far removed from the old Hekdesh, the traditional: ghetto hospital, it was almost as far removed from what the Mt. Sinai Hospital is today. It had a 150 bed capacity־,, cost $30,000 to construct, and admitted 271 patients during the first five months. But it had only about 15 to 25 patients at any one time. Its report for 1857 states that its patients consisted of 110 Germans, 64 Polish, 5 native, and 1 Rus sian Jew. Out of the 285 patients handled during that year, 200 were free. Twenty-eight patients were the largest number at any one time during that year. There was only one resident physician and one salaried surgeon. The salaries of nine paid officials amounted to $1,684, and the total annual expenditure was only $9,700. The hospital owned a burial ground which was probably a convenience and economy! It interested itself in the care of the patients after they left the institution, thereby anticipating present day medical social service. The expenditure of $9,700 in 1857 should be compared with an expenditure of almost $1,700,000 in 1935, to obtain a proper view of the amazing growth which this hospital has had. The other aspects of its work have had the same kind of development. Thus, for instance, the 285 patients treated in this hospital in that year should be compared with 13,858 patients treated in 1935.64 We get something of an idea of the enormous develop ment that has taken place in about eighty years when we realize that today Greater New York alone has 18 hospitals and sanitaria for the care of the Jewish sick, with a capacity of almost 4,000 beds, spending annually about $9,000,000, and that there are close to 70 Jewish hospitals in the United States with a total bed capacity of about 9,000, with an annual expenditure of approximately $19,000,000; that</page><page sequence="48">94 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Jewish hospitals throughout the country give a total of more than 2,750,000 days care to the Jewish and non-Jewish sick; also, that there are approximately 4,300 professional persons engaged in these different institutions.65 Some of the Jewish hospitals are among the foremost in the country. Hospitals like Mt. Sinai in New York City, Michael Reese in Chicago, Mt. Sinai in Cleveland, Beth Israel in Boston, Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Cedars of Lebanon in Los Angeles, etc., would be listed among the leading medical institutions in the country. These and the other Jewish hospitals cater not only to the Jewish sick but to the non-Jewish as well. They are centers of research and training for physicians and nurses so that they make their contribution no.t only to the Jewish but to the general community as well. There are in, addition, between 40 and 50 Jewish clinics and out-patient departments mostly asso ciated with the hospitals. These institutions received 2,295, 793 visits from Jewish and non-Jewish patients during 1935. The problem of mental disease presents a somewhat dif ferent picture. Although it is now well established that Jews have less than their numerically proportionate share of psychoses, the problem of neuroses is fairly serious.66 Nevertheless, there is not a single hospital, under Jewish auspices, for the care of the mentally ill. They are usually sent to general hospitals for the insane which are maintained by by the different states and their subdivisions. Another problem which has received scant attention in comparison with its importance, is that of chronic disease. There is only one large private Jewish hospital for chronic diseases in New York City, and none in the rest of the country. Indeed, there are no hospitals for chronic disease in the general community except those maintained by the City, County, or State. These latter are usually run on a rather low level and are little more than poor-farms which receive the broken-down dregs of society. The patient suffering from an incurable ailment may well abandon hope, not only of being cured, but of ending his days in a reason ably decent and satisfactory environment, once he is ad mitted to such an institution. The problem is of increasing importance because with the lengthening of the span of life and the intensification of</page><page sequence="49">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 95 the stresses and strains of modern civilization, more and more people break down only to find that the society which they served and whcih has developed such excellent facilities for caring for the acutely ill, has made little or no provision for them. The reasons for this are many and varied. Among the most important are the following: (1) The average stay of patients suffering from acute diseases is about two weeks. The chronically ill require much more extensive care and therefore would reduce the hospitals' turnover were they to be treated in the general hospitals. (2) Chronic diseases are less interesting and less satisfying to the physicians who donate their time and skill to the hospitals. They prefer to treat those diseases and patients that offer the greatest promise for quick cures. They would lose some of their incentive if the general hospitals were to house many chronic patients. (3) Hospital costs and medical fees come very high. The average patient cannot afford a long drawn out illness. Neither the hospital nor the physician can expect the patient to continue to pay for services and treatment over the long periods required by chronic diseases. Since both depend upon fees for their income they necessarily seek to shift the burden to the community. It is because of these and other factors that the private hospital is said to be eager to discharge or transfer patients suffering from chronic diseases to the City hospitals. The Jewish group faces a special problem in this respect because, as we have seen (p. 51), they are believed to con stitute an older group due to the fact that there is so large a proportion of immigrants among them. Moreover, their problems of adjustment as immigrants, their struggle for existence and their stresses and strains because of social and economic discrimination, are probably much more severe than among the rest of the population. It may be expected, therefore, that they will have comparatively large numbers of people who will give way under their burdens. Whether this is so in reality, no one knows. Information regarding Jewish morbidity and mortality is practically non-existant. It is known that the one Jewish hospital for</page><page sequence="50">96 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK chronic disease has a waiting list of several hundred who are eager to get in, and that many patients find their way to the public institutions to end their days in them. The Montefiore Hospital for Chronic Diseases in New York City was organized in 1884 in honor of the hundredth birthday of the British Jewish philanthropist, Moses Montefiore. It was first conceived of as a "Home for Chronic Invalids." If not for the vision and courage of some of its founders and guiding spirits, it no doubt would have remained little more than a glorified infirmary such as may be found attached to most of the larger homes for the aged. It is due to them and their generosity that this hospital is spoken of by the Commissioner of Hospitals of New York City, perhaps the foremost hospital authority in the world, as "a pioneer in the scientific treatment of chronic disease, a leader whose sustained interest commands respect, an institution whose methods are an inspiration and a challenge to all who are charged with the care of the chronic sick." This hospital has close to 1000 beds of which only about 60 are semi-private with a very nominal charge. The free beds are almost always occupied. With an annual expendi ture of more than 81,250,000, only a very small fraction comes from patients; about 40% of its budget comes from the City government and an additional 25% is contributed by the Jewish Federation. Its buildings and grounds repre sent an investment of over $6,000,000; it has a medical staff of more than 200 physicians some of whom are among the leaders in their respective spécialités; it is affiliated with Columbia University for teaching purposes, and carries on an extensive program of research in practically all types of chronic disease. In 1936 it provided about 330,000 hospital days to patients in its city institution and Country Sana torium for the tuberculous. One of the most significant aspects of its work is the manner in which it has been able to overcome the natural handicaps facing an institution for chronic disease. Its major problems in this respect, were the attitudes of the physicians, the patients, and the interest of the community. All of these have been greatly aided by the emphasis on research and the high quality of its work. From a custodial</page><page sequence="51">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 97 institution it has been converted into a first class hospital for the scientific care of the type of patients who, but a short time ago, were abandoned to their fate. While this hospital has been fortunate in its leaders and sponsors who have made this type of work possible, it may not be too much to hope that other groups, institutions, and communities will follow its lead. There can be little doubt of the need for this type of work. C. Child Care The care of Jewish orphans and dependent children in the United States presents a similar picture. From the date when the first Jewish orphans' home in the United States was organized in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1801, this type of Jewish social work experienced great growth and progress. In New York City the first orphan home was opened in 1860, in a rented house which accom modated thirty children. Eight years later, the facilities were enlarged to accommodate 150 children. Today New York City alone has five organizations devoted to the care of dependent children with a total population of 5000 chil dren. There are about 100 organizations throughout the country for the care of dependent children either in institu tions or foster homes. They spent, in 1935, almost five and one-half million dollars. Approximately 10,000 Jewish chil dren, of whom only a comparatively small number are full or half orphans, are maintained in these different institutions. But it is not only in physical facilities for dependent chil dren that enormous progress has been made in the last century. The old conception of child care, from the stand points of the kind of care to be given, the discipline, the educational facilities, the selection of children, after-care, medical, psychiatric and vocational treatment, etc., has undergone profound changes. Communities now recognize that they have a unique responsibility for the care of the children entrusted to them. Many feel that children so unfortunate as to have been deprived of their parents or to be forced to face life with physical, mental or emotional handicaps, should be given the very best care and attention</page><page sequence="52">98 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK and such training as will best enable them to compete sue cessfully for a livelihood. The better institutions send their more promising children to colleges and professional schools. Systems of after-care have been organized and every effort is made to help the children overcome their handicaps and to take their places as normal men and women in the com munities into which they are discharged.67 Two significant developments in child care, departures from the traditional orphans' homes, must be mentioned. One is the cottage plan and the other is the foster home plan. In the first the attempt is made to recreate a family atmosphere for the children through small cottages housing about twenty children of various ages and both sexes, pre sided over by a "cottage mother" who aims to establish and maintain a spirit and attitude as nearly approximating the normal home as humanly possible. The earliest Jewish cottage home was that of the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society in Pleasantville, New York. More modern develop ments of this same plan are the Jewish child care institutions in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Cleveland. A similarly important development is the foster home type of care for dependent children based on the principle that the child develops best in a small family unit. This principle was enunciated at the famous White House Con ference of persons interested in child welfare, called by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909, to consider the best means of caring for dependent and handicapped children. Since that time the tendency has been to place more and more children in small families with foster parents.68 The oretically at least the attempt is made to incorporate these children into the family unit and the foster children are supposed to take their places in the homes as do the sons and daughters of the families in which they are placed. The preferences as between institutional and foster care may be gleaned from the fact that whereas the percentage of children in institutions has decreased from 55% in 1929 to 38.7% in 1935, the percentage in foster homés increased from 43.3% in 1929 to 55.4% in 1935. These figures are based on reports of 28 child care agencies.65</page><page sequence="53">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 99 The controversy as to whether institutional or foster care is best suited for dependent children has been bitter and acrimonious at times. Each type of care had and still has its strong adherents and opponents. Institutions have been charged with neglecting the emotional side of the child's development; as providing an unnatural environ ment for children; with inability to care for or to reckon with the individual nature and needs of the child; as poorly equipped to prepare the child for his return to his home or the community; as very expensive because of capital expenditures; etc. Foster-home care has been criticised as providing poor homes; that foster-parents are interested in the compensa tion rather than in the children; as requiring frequent transfers and replacements thus imposing an emotional and nervous strain on the children; as unable to provide for joint placements of several children of the same family; as providing little or no opportunity for Jewish education; etc. Child care workers, agencies, and communities have been striving to develop principles of allocation which would serve as guides for placing children in the type of care best adapted to their needs. Such principles are grad ually emerging out of the accumulated experience of the various child care agencies. Some communities established "Clearing Bureaus" for the distribution of children. These bureaus are usually controlled by Boards of Directors com posed of representatives of both types of child care to insure adequate consideration of the different interests involved. While While these efforts have not always been entirely successful, the conflict and strife are gradually subsiding. Both sides are beginning to realize and admit that each kind of care has a contribution to make and is best adapted to certain types of children. In a number of communities, Jewish and non-Jewish child-care agencies receive a subsidy from the government for each dependent child. These subsidies amount to hun dreds of thousands of dollars annually. In addition to these subsidies dependent children are aided by the State to remain in their own homes by granting a weekly stipend where the father has been removed bv death or other</page><page sequence="54">100 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK causes, through the system of Mothers' Pensions. Not infrequently children are enabled to remain with their re latives, in cases of loss of both parents, through the system of subsidies. In some instances family care societies and child care agencies keep a motherless home intact by placing housekeepers or caretakers in the home.70 Neither the cottage plan nor the foster home plan is Jewish in origin. But Jewish Agencies have emphasized the notion that the community owes its dependent children the best care possible in order to prepare them to take their place in society. As a result, Jewish child care agencies have developed unusually high standards of work, and in this way have profoundly influenced the general child care field. Jewish child care did not experience the large fluctuations in the last few years which characterized the work of the family societies. On the whole the years of depression made only a comparatively slight difference in the work of these institutions. D. Care of the Aged The care of the Jewish aged is a substantial although not a large problem. There are about 60 old people's homes which care for approximately 6,000 persons.71 These insti tutions are maintained from the funds collected by the federations in the different cities. They spend approx imately $2,300,000 annually. It is not yet known what the adoption of Old Age Pension provisions in many of the states of the Union will do to this activity. But it is certain that the extent of the problem will not increase. VILVII. ADULT EDUCATION AND RECREATION; YOUTH MOVEMENTS The recreational problems are dealt with in several ways. There are, first, the activities of the men's and women's clubs connected with synagogues and temples. Then there are various cultural organizations each of which has some type of recreational activity related to Jewish education, broadlv conceived. There are, in addition, agencies directly</page><page sequence="55">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 101 concerned with activities for adult education, such as the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations, Educational Alliances, Jewish People's Institutes, Com munity Centers, etc. There are also Young People's Leagues, devoting at least part of their energies to post-school educa tion. Of all of these activities space will permit only the consideration of the more formal type of organization and its activities, namely, that commonly referred to as the Jewish Centen The first organization of this type came into existence in 1874 in New York City as the Young Men's Hebrew Asso ciation, which is still in existence. Though ostensibly modeled after the Young Men's Christian Association and very largely influenced by the desire on the part of Jewish leaders to keep the Jewish youth from non-Jewish influences by creating similar recreational and educational facilities for them under Jewish auspices, the Jewish Center of today differs in some fundamental respects from its prototypes in the non-Jewish community, the nearest of which are the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations and the social settlements. It differs from the first two in the comprehensiveness of its program, in the non-theological approach to its work, in its efforts to meet the needs of all the members in the community, and in its development of a cultural program. It differs from the settlement in its more democratic form of organization, in the intensive and com prehensive Jewish cultural activities and programs, and in its aim at making its activities self-supporting although few "Centers" have thus far achieved this aim. Some of the agencies are "community centers" in the broad sense of the term, catering to the needs of young and old, boys and girls, men and women; others limit their activities to only one or more of these groups, such as the Y. M. H. A.'s or the Y. W. H. A.'s, or to a restricted group such as is served by some of the Centers attached to syn agogues and temples. But these are in the minority. The majority of these organizations aim to serve all sections of the Jewish population. Some of them have programs of religious, cultural, educational, artistic, vocational, physical education, and general recreational activities. The major problem facing these agencies is the development of programs</page><page sequence="56">102 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK of recreation and education for character building and self development on as constructive a basis as possible, which will will at the same time be in line with the desires and wishes of their members and clientele who are not always the best judges of what the most valuable programs would be.73 The greatest development of Jewish centers in point of numbers took place in the first two decades of the present century. The World War gave a tremendous impetus to these "Centers" by making communities conscious of the need for recreational facilities for their youth. In 1921, the Jewish Welfare Board, organized during the war to serve the Jewish soldiers in the camps in this country and abroad, became the national organization for Jewish Community Centers. It took over the work previously done by the Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Associations, and con tinued to carry on the activities which it had conducted during the World War. It has become the central agency for the development of Jewish Community Centers, Young Men's Hebrew Associations, and similar organizations. It has a membership of more than 300 such organizations, which spend approximately $4,000,000 annually, (seep. 80). and represent an individual membership of about 300,000. The Jewish Welfare Board developed standards of pro cedure, principles and policies of operatiop. It has con ducted, for its local agencies, campaigns for buildings, for membership and for maintenance. It publishes The Jewish Center,Center, a quarterly, various types of program material, and cooperates with the National Association of Jewish Center Executives. It has continued its interest in the Jewish men in the United States Army and Navy, and also conducts welfare activities for disabled veterans and their families, and for young men in the Civilian Conservation Corps, a recently organized activity by the Federal Govern ment for taking care of the unemployed youth. It has stimulated and supervised the construction of buildings throughout the country. Through publications, field service, and conferences of regional and national scope, it has united these centers into a strong group of organizations serving hundreds of thousands of Jewish youth. It has been esti mated that between $30,000,000 and $40,000,000 have been</page><page sequence="57">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 103 spent by Jewish communities throughout the country in the last two or three decades on buildings to serve the needs of Jewish youth. The Jewish Welfare Board is maintained from the income of an endowment fund created during the War, appropriations from Federations and Welfare funds, (to be discussed later), and donations from private individuals. The "Jewish Centers" are maintained from membership dues, fees, donations of interested individuals, and in some instances by the federations in their local communities.73 A number of other organizations are important in this connection. Among these is the B'nai B'rith, which, in its "Wider Scope Activities," carries on a program of education among large numbers of Jews, including college students. These are served by student centers called "Hillel Foun dations," with branches on the campuses of about fifteen universities.74 Young Judea, organized in 1909, as a nationalist youth organization, has as its purpose to perpetuate the ideals of Judaism in their relationship to American Jewish life. It aims to unite the Jewish youth and to inîerest them in the "history of the Jewish people, in a proper understanding of the role of Palestine in Jewish life and in active participa tion in its upbuilding as the Jewish National Homeland." It has about 750 clubs for boys and girls throughout the country with a membership of approximately 20,000. The National Organization prepares educational material, sug gests programs for the clubs and assists them in the selection of leaders. It is maintained from individual donations.75 The Jewish Chautauqua Society was organized in 1893. Its activities include publication of textbooks for parents and teachers, arranging conferences for religious school teachers in order to develop an interest in Jewish education. It carries on an educational program by sending rabbis to summer sessions of the different universities throughout the United States to lecture on Jewish history, literature, and culture, before Jewish students and teachers in attendance during the summer. This organization is maintained by individual contributions.76 There is no such thing as a Jewish youth movement in the United States, if by that is meant a coordinated, well planned and directed activity. There are rather a variety</page><page sequence="58">104 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK of organizations each aiming to attract the Jewish youth to its particular program. The Young Judea, discussed above, is one of these. There are about 20 other similar national organizations. In 1934, when a study of these organizations was under taken, it was estimated that their combined membership was between fifty thousand and seventy-five thousand. Of these 21 organizations, 13 place their emphasis on Zionist activities. One organization looks upon Palestine as the means for achieving a program of social justice and universal brotherhood. Five organizations use Palestine as a means of adjusting Jewish youth in America to the American envi ronment. Although in general their program is similar to the 13 organizations mentioned above which have a frankly Zionist program, they emphasize the American rather than the Palestine scene. Two organizations aim at the advance ment of Judaism. In general the objectives of youth organizations may be said to be the following: 1. Rehabilitation of Palestine; 2. Advancement of Judaism; 3. Jewish Cultural Advance ment; 4. Development of social ideals; 5. Jewish unity; 6. Social justice; 7. Combating Anti-Semitism.77 Curiously, these organizations have not been much con cerned with the problem of vocational guidance for Amer ican Jewish youth. They have rather been directing their activities at developing in the youth a Jewish consciousness and interesting them in Jewish activities. Each of these organizations is more or less independent of the others, has its own program, secures funds wherever it can, and is responsible only to its leaders for what it accomplishes. VIII. CENTRAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR LOCAL AND NATIONAL NEEDS A. Central Organizations for Local Purposes The manifold activities of the Jewish communities already discussed, brought a realization to the leaders of these com munities that better organization and coordination are necessary for the most effective work. Toward the close of the nineteenth century the Jewish Federation came into</page><page sequence="59">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 105 existence, first in Boston in 1895, and in Cincinnati in the following year. At first, these federations and the others which followed, aimed primarily at a more effective collec tion of funds. Later/especially since the War, and more especially during the third decade of the present century,78 federations became communal agencies whose function it is not only to provide financial support for their constituent societies but to plan for the community needs along con structive lines. Today, with a few exceptions, the federa tions aim to support, coordinate, and control the needed social service agencies and activities in their respective communities. Some federations are beginning to shoulder also the burden of raising funds in the local communities for the support of nationwide as well as overseas Jewish ac tivities. Whether directly or through welfare funds, (to be discussed later) national and overseas projects are included in annual drives for funds held in different communities. There are approximately 70 federations of Jewish charities in the United States today. Practically every community of any significant size has a federation. They spend about $10,000,000 annually. In many cities they are the one central organization which represents all shades of opinion in the Jewish community. While they are not yet and may never be the communal organization that one finds in some communities in Europe, they usually have the support and good-will of the entire Jewish population. It should not be inferred from the above that federa tions are not subject to severe criticism or that all Jews support the federations in their respective communities. On the contrary, there is a great deal of criticism of the philosophy and procedure of federations as we shall see later (see p. 136). Nor can it be said that federation support is widespread among the Jewish populations in the various federation cities. Many federation leaders are dissatisfied with the extent of community support from the standpoints of numbers contributing and the amount of their contributions. Attempts are being made to "widen the base of contributors." Table 11 compares the Jewish populations in 28 cities, the number of contributors to federations and welfare funds, and the ratio of contributors to the Jewish popula</page><page sequence="60">106 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK tion. Since these cities have almost 60% of the Jewish population in the United States and raise almost 75% of the total amount raised by federations and welfare funds in the United States, they may be 'taken as fairly repre sentative, especially since they represent also the different types of communities with respect to size and community chest affiliation.

M. Freund and George Wolfe of the Council of Federations and Welfare Funds.</page><page sequence="61">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 107 It will be observed from Table 11, that only about 6% of the total Jewish population may be said to contribute to federations and welfare funds. However, this figure is rather misleading, since it is usually the head of the family who makes the contribution which includes the entire family. Accordingly, the total Jewish population should be divided by approximately four (because wealthier fam ilies are usually smaller), in order to obtain the number of families represented. The resultant figure is much more encouraging. It indicates that out of about 640,000 families in these cities, 151,000, or about 25%, are represented among the contributors to federations and welfare funds. Bearing in mind that according to a study by the Brookings Institution in Washington, America's Capacity to Consume, for 1929, the most prosperous year in recent history, only about 35% of the urban families in the United States have an annual income of $3,000 and over, which might be as sumed to be the minimum for voluntary charitable con tribution, the number of Jewish contributors seems much more adequate. This is true unless one assumes that the Jewish population is differently situated with respect to income than is the general population. While there may be some ground for this belief because of the differences in occupational distribution, there are no data available to justify such an assumption in the present discussion. A considerably different and in some ways more dis turbing picture of the situation is obtained when the con tributions are analyzed. Studies which have been made indicate that 85% of the funds come from about 14% of the contributors. What is worse, approximately 54% of the con tributions come from about 1J4% of the contributors.79 A recent review of the situation by the Joint Distribution Committee, summarizing its 1936 campaign experience in 47 communities, in which 81,473 contributors gave almost $4,000,000, shows that 1K% of the contributors gave 57% of the funds; 7% gave 23% of the funds; and 91J^% of the contributors gave only 20% of the funds.80 The large contributors naturally exercise the greatest influence in the federation. Consequently, questions have been raised about the representativeness and democratic nature of federations. These items will be considered later</page><page sequence="62">108 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK in a critical examination of the Jewish social work situation in the United States. Here, it may be said that the federa tions and their constituent societies, those which are doing the day by day work in caring for the poor, the sick, the orphans, the widows, the aged, have brought a great deal of credit upon the Jews in this country. Through the Jewish Federation, Jewish communities have made a contribution of incalculable importance and signif icance to the general community. The community chests, which serve the general community in the same way as the federations serve the Jewish community, and which are the pride of most of the cities throughout the country, are a direct outcome of the Jewish federations and were pro foundly influenced by them. In many instances, the leaders of the general community chests were recruited from among those who were trained in leadership in communal affairs in the Jewish federations. In a number of cities, community chests would have fared badly if the leadership supplied by the Jewish communities had not been available. This is true, not only with respect to personnel but also with respect to the standard of giving. It is well known that Jews give more liberally, proportionately, to their federations as well as to the community chests than do non-Jews. Even today the community chests, in a number of cities, lag behind the Jewish federations in their plan of organization, the adequacy of their allowances to their constituent societies, in the coordination of the work of the societies, and in the respon sibility which they feel for the development of organizations to meet new needs in the community. Having stimulated the creation of the community chest movement, the federations were in turn greatly influenced by it. At first, community chests developed rapidly and made larger funds available to their constituent organ izations. Toward the end of the third decade, however, there was a good deal of talk about the "saturation point in giving" having been reached, so that the community chests were much less successful in raising their quotas than formerly. Jewish organizations suffered in common with non-Jewish organizations and they were faced with the dilemma : to remain in the chest and suffer from inadequate financial support, falling behind in the progressive march</page><page sequence="63">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 109 which characterized some of the non-chest federations; or to withdraw from the community chest, be charged with separatism, disloyalty, etc.,. but have the opportunity of developing their work as did the other cities. They chose to remain in the chests and sought other ways of meeting their special needs. There are a number of problems which Jewish federa tions in community chests must face sooner or later. Some of these have already presented themselves in one way or another in the different communities. It is to be regretted that no one has thus far studied these problems in all their ramifications and implications. No one can say, therefore, that community chest affiliation is good or bad for the Jewish communities; that they should be continued, mod ified, or abandoned. No authoritative statement along these lines will be possible until the relationships will be thoroughly studied and conclusions drawn from an objec tive examination of the experiences to date. Partisan state ments and arguments, for or against, have but little value other than to indicate the areas and type of questions to be studied. Among the more important questions which should be considered in this connection the following may be listed: 1. 1. What is the effect of community chest affiliation on anti-Semitism, either existing or potential? It is some times argued that such affiliation tends to refute the charge of Jewish separatism and clanishness, makes for better understanding between Jews and non-Jews, provides for more intimate contacts, gives each group insight into the other's problems, etc. On the other hand, it has been sug gested that the differences in standards and requirements of Jewish agencies and individuals, which are not infre quently higher than the non-Jewish, are likely to cause friction, irritation, and possibly ill feeling. This because the funds coming from the same source should presumably be distributed on the same basis and in accordance with the same standards. Some communities have already faced this problem and it was not easy to explain to those in charge of the distri bution of community chest funds, why Jewish families</page><page sequence="64">110 AMERICAN־ JEWISH YEAR BOOK should have more liberal allowances than the non-Jewish families when the funds are derived from the entire com munity. The dangers of misunderstanding in such a pro cedure are obvious. It has been suggested, also, that one way of solving this problem would be for the Jewish com munity to raise supplementary funds for this purpose. But this, too, is open to misinterpretation. Some com munity chest leaders may assume that all available funds for local relief purposes should be given to the chest and that any funds collected by the Jewish community for supplementary purposes would have gone to the chest if there were no need for additional funds for local Jewish needs. 2. Another problem along the same lines arises from the possibility of the Jewish community receiving more from the chest than Jewish contributors give to it. In a sense this is a contradiction of the fundamental philosophy and principles of the community chest. For affiliation with the chest on the part of the Jewish or any other group should not be on a quid pro quo basis. Ideally every mem ber of the community should give as much as he can afford. Others should receive as much as they need or the chest can afford. No one is supposed to know how much a given group gives or receives from the chest. In reality, how ever, the situation is quite different. Since the Jewish group has membership in the receiving-end of the chest through its social agencies or through the Jewish federation, it is not difficult to determine how much these agencies receive from it. And, although it is more difficult to deter mine how much is contributed by Jews, this is not impos sible of accomplishment. Some people have had the feeling that subversive of the best principles of the community chest as such figures and comparisons are, they have been resorted to. Jewish community leaders, especially those who are also leaders in the chest, are frequently uneasy about the mat ter. They realize only too well that such calculations are not only unfair but are likely to be injurious to the Jewish position in the community. They are no less dangerous for the community integration which should flow from community chest participation. The unfairness derives</page><page sequence="65">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 111 from the fact that in such calculations no allowance is made for the non-Jewish work which Jewish agencies such as hospitals and settlements are doing. All of it is likely to be charged as going to Jews. On the other hand Jews are bound to receive less credit than is their due at the con tributions end. First because not all Jewish contributors may be known as Jews; and second because contributions from large corporations where Jews are stockholders are never credited to Jews even though the contributions are ultimately paid for by the stockholders. It will be clear, therefore, that in any such comparisons, Jews would be debited with more than they receive and credited with less than they give. However this does not mean that the comparisons, unfair as they may be, may not be made. The awareness of the possibility is frequently a source of concern to the Jewish leaders with the result that they over-compensate at both ends; bringing pressure upon Jewish contributors for more generous contributions; and using their influence with the Jewish agencies for moderate budgetary requests. 3. A third problem relates to the effect which com munity chest affiliation has upon Jewish leadership. One of the arguments in favor of community chest affiliation is the opportunity which it gives Jewish leaders for activity in and contributions to broader fields. But these oppor tunities are not always an unmixed blessing so far as the Jewish community is concerned. They not infrequently result in diffusion of interest, dissipation of energy, and divided loyalty. 4. A similar problem is the influence upon Jewish con tributors. As already indicated, Jewish standards of giving and receiving are higher, proportionally, than the non Jewish. In the beginning it was hoped that Jewish stand ards will influence the non-Jewish standards. But experience proved otherwise. Whether it is because of the difference in campaign methods, indirectness of claim and appeal, or the lower standard of contributions among non-Jews, it is generally assumed that Jewish contributions to the chest are on a lower level than are their contributions to</page><page sequence="66">112 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK distinctly Jewish causes. Nevertheless, their contributions to the chest are almost invariably more generous, in propor tion to their wealth, than are the non-Jewish contributions. 5. The effect of community chests on the Jewish agencies can be surmised from the foregoing. But the struggles for higher standards, even though they may be defeated at times, are by no means the greatest disadvantage they face. Much more serious is the feeling, not infrequently expressed, that since the financial support comes from the same source and since the standards are or should be more or less the same, there is little justification for maintaining separate Jewish agencies. Proposals are occasionally made for merging Jewish with non-Jewish agencies in order to save administrative expenses; or to place Jewish workers in non-Jewish agencies to handle Jewish problems. Although such instances are still relatively few they come with greater frequency and greater insistence. Similarly, it is much more difficult to create new organizations for meeting new needs when the funds must be obtained from the chest than from the federation. This is not so much because it is more difficult to get appropriations from the chest than from the federation as it is due to the greater relue tance on the part of the Jewish leaders to seek the funds from the chest. 6.6. In addition to the foregoing there is some question whether chest support of Jewish agencies does not tend to weaken Jewish interest in and identification with the Jewish agencies and problems. It has been pretty well established that the process of fund raising for community needs is one of the best means of educating the community to an intelligent appreciation of its needs and problems as well as some of the factors giving rise to them. Where the fund raising is done for the entire community there is less opportunity for empha sizing the specifically Jewish needs and problems. This is bound to result in a lessening of the sense of responsibility on the part of the Jews for Jewish needs. Although this has been offset in some degree by the welfare-fund move ment which, as we shall see presently, raises funds for specifically Jewish causes, the problem nevertheless exists. It has become aggravated during the depression years by</page><page sequence="67">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 113 governmental assumption of the responsibility for some of the activities formerly carried by private agencies. Despite these and other limitations of the community chests there can be little doubt that they have been of great benefit to Jewish agencies at least during the depression. They have provided resources and stability which might otherwise not have been available during one of the most difficult periods of American history. It is estimated that in 1935 Jewish agencies in 63 cities, having a total annual ex penditure of approximately $7,100,000, received $4,077,000, or about 43% of their funds from community chests. The extent of Jewish affiliation with community chests may be judged from the fact that out of 140 cities having chests, 83, or almost 60%, include the Jewish agencies. Out of 80 cities having Jewish federations and community chests, 52, or 65% of the federations, are in the chests.81 In the last decade or so there has developed in the United States a central financial organization, commonly known as the "Welfare Fund," for the purpose of supporting non local philanthropic services, such as the national and over seas agencies. The creation of the "Welfare Fund" was due in part to the fact that the federations were handicapped in their support of non-local activities because contributors occasionally insisted that their contributions were designed to assist local agencies. A more important factor, however, was the fact that many federations were affiliated with general community chests which are of a strictly local char acter. It was impossible for these community chests to support Jewish agencies whose activities were cultural or were outside the particular city. A means had to be found for enabling the Jewish community to collect funds for the support of those organizations, whether local or non-local in character, which could not be included in the community chest set-up. At the present time there are about 30 welfare funds in the country. There are as yet no generally acceptable criteria for judging either the need for or quality of work of a given national or overseas agency or its eligibility to welfare fund support. The tendency, however, is in the direction of creating the necessary standards.</page><page sequence="68">114 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK In the last few years the dissatisfaction with the repre sentativeness of federations and welfare funds expressed itself in the demand for a more representative organization. Several communities have been experimenting with a "Com munity Council," which is made up of representatives from all the organizations interested in communal problems and activities. It is altogether too early to attempt to evaluate this experiment. In Cleveland, Ohio, where a Council was organized about two years ago, those who have been close to the work seem pleased with its achievements thus far, especially since it has been able to make some headway and achieve some success with difficult community problems, as for example, the aggravated problem of Kashrut (Kosher meat).82 But young as is this experiment, it is not without some critics. There are some who see in it another instru ment for controlling community activity by the same people who now control the federations and welfare funds.83 Others see in such criticism a poorly veiled attempt on the part of the critics to seize control of this activity for their own purposes. To the non-partisan observer it seems to repre sent an interesting effort at democratizing American Jewish community organization. B. National Agencies The national organizations referred to in the preceding paragraphs in connection with welfare funds, constitute a large portion of Jewish communal work in this country. It is difficult to say how many such organizations there are, but it may be safely estimated that between 40 and 50 national organizations, spending about five and one-half million dollars annually, are partly supported by federa tions and welfare funds. A national organization may be defined roughly as an agency which serves no particular locality but the country as a whole. It may do its work in the United States or overseas, or both at home and abroad. National agencies, for our present purposes, may be grouped under six headings. There are, first, the medical agencies. These are hospitals located mainly in Denver,</page><page sequence="69">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 115 Colorado, and Los Angeles, California, for the care of tuber culous patients either while the disease is active or quiescent. Some of these agencies also care for the families of the patients. There are five such agencies spending approximately one million dollars annually. A second group of national agencies may be said to consist of agencies doing educational and cultural work. Among these might be mentioned The B'nai B'rith in its "wider scope" activities; The Jewish Chautauqua Society; The National Farm School ; The Jewish Publication Society; Young Judaea; The Menorah Association; etc. A third group of National organizations includes the civic and protective agencies: The American Jewish Committee; The American Jewish Congress; The Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith; The Jewish Labor Committee; and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. This agency is included among the organizations functioning for the protection of civic rights because without some such service as that ren dered by it the work of the others would be seriously ham pered. Its form of organization was changed recently from a private enterprise operated for profit to a communally owned agency with a responsible Board of Directors which determines its policies. This group expends approximately $500,000 per year. The fourth group consists of a number of agencies con cerned with community service and coordination. Among these may be mentioned : The National Conference of Jewish Social Service; The Graduate School for Jewish Social Work■ The National Desertion Bureau, which though located in New York serves also other communities; The Jewish Wei fare Board, already discussed in connection with adult education (p. 102); The Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds; The National Coordinating Committee for Aid to German Refugees; The German Jewish Children's Aid, Inc. ; etc. A fifth group may be said to consist of such agencies as the Conference on Jewish Relations; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, primarily concerned with aiding immigrants and their relatives ; The National Council of Jewish Women, which is also concerned with immigrants, especially immi grant girls and women. It also does other types of work</page><page sequence="70">116 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK including granting assistance to poor students in obtaining an education, either through its own funds or through its auxiliary, the Council of Jewish Juniors, an organization of Jewish young women; etc. The sixth group consists of agencies for overseas recon struction and relief. Among these should be mentioned: The Joint Distribution Committee; The ORT; The Amer ican Palestine Campaign; The Jewish National Fund; The Hadassah ; The American Friends of the Hebrew University ; etc. Space does not permit detailing the work of these agencies. Nevertheless a few should be briefly described in addition to those already discussed.84 Among the most important national agencies from the standpoint of social work is the National Conference of Jewish Social Service (recently changed to "Welfare"). As organized in 1899, it was composed of lay and professional persons. More recently, it has developed its activities along distinctly professional lines. In the last decade and a half, its annual meetings have been devoted to the development of a professionally conscious and technically trained group of men and women devoting themselves to professional problems. This Conference was directly or indirectly respon sible for the establishment of several organizations of national scope, most important of which are the National Desertion Bureau, an organization already mentioned, which devotes itself to locating the husbands of deserted wives; and The Graduate School for Jewish Social Work. It has published proceedings of its annual meetings since 1900 and issues a quarterly journal, The Jewish Social Service Service Quarterly J'׳ In the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, organized in 1925, a facility was created for training young men and women to engage in Jewish social work as a profession. This School is a national institution, strictly graduate in character requiring the Bachelor's degree for admission, with a faculty consisting of some of the foremost Jewish social workers and scholars in the country. It is authorized by the Regents of the State of New York to give the Master's and Doctor's degrees. The course of study is two years. It has drawn its students from, and distributed them to,</page><page sequence="71">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 117 all parts of the country. In the twelve years of its existence it has had an enrollment of about 1000 persons who have taken either part or the full course of study. It has under taken various types of research on the different aspects of Jewish life in America.86 It has maintained its work on a level equal to the best general schools of social work. Since 1928 it has been a member of the American Association of Schools of Social Work, comprising more than 30 general schools of social work connected with American universities, and its Director was President of the Association for two years, (1932-1934). In this way it has materially influenced social work education in the United States.87 Another important national agency from the standpoint of Jewish social work is the Bureau of Jewish Social Research. This organization, created in 1919, has conducted surveys of Jewish communal activities in most of the communities in the country. In this way it was instrumental in affecting the standards and activities of most of the Jewish social agencies. In 1935 it was merged with the newly-created National Council of Federations and Welfare Funds. This latter organization, (the word "National" in its name was dropped in 1936), aims to coordinate the work of the federa tions and welfare funds . It continues the field service by the "Bureau," formerly conducted for the purpose of stim ulating a wider participation of lay leadership in Jewish social work. It has annual and regional meetings for the purpose of considering current problems and recent trends and tendencies. Most of the federations and welfare funds are constituents of this organization. It publishes Notes and News,News, periodically, and, in 1935 and 1936, issued the Jewish Social Social Work Year Books for 1934 and 1935 respectively. About three years ago there was organized in New York City, The Conference on Jewish Relations. Its purpose is to inquire into the social, educational, and economic problems of Jewish adjustment in America. This organization is still in the formative stage and it cannot yet be said what its program or future will be. Thus far it has emphasized activities which throw light on problems of economic adjust ment and anti-Semitism. It aims to be scientific in its approach by undertaking and encouraging others to under take studies and publications in the fields of its interests.</page><page sequence="72">118 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Recently, (June 1937), it announced the publication of a scientific quarterly journal, Jewish Social Studies, with the first issue scheduled to appear in the Fall of 1937. It has maintained itself and its program through membership dues, contributions from interested individuals, and the devoted services of a few of its leaders.88 Its membership consists very largely of professional men and women. The National Coordinating Committee for Aid to German Refugees was organized in 1934, through the efforts of James G. McDonald, High Commissioner for Refugees from Ger many! of the League of Nations. The activities of this organization are national and overseas in scope. It acts as a central registry and clearing bureau for all organiza tions interested in the refugee problem; refers to appropriate agencies cases of immigrants needing assistance; handles special problems for which no other agency is prepared to assume responsibility; organizes local committees for dis tributing refugees in the interior cities; explores possibilities for employment throughout the United States; deals with special immigration and deportation cases; cooperates with Federal and State labor departments on questions of pass ports and immigration procedure ; subsidizes the transporta tion and other expenses for repatriation ; secures information from abroad for those who have relatives there; etc. The German-Jewish Children's Aid, Inc., chartered under the laws of the State of New York in 1934, has undertaken the education and placement of 250 German-Jewish chil dren brought to the United States. Two hundred and thirty-six children have already arrived and are being cared for at the present time in private families in 58 cities in 19 states, under the supervision of professionally equipped child welfare agencies. IX. PARTICIPATION IN JEWISH EFFORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES A. For Relief and Reconstruction Among the national organizations engaged in relief and reconstruction in other countries, the largest and most impor tant is the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, or as it is usually referred to, The Joint Distribution Com</page><page sequence="73">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 119 mittee, or J.D.C. This organization was established in 1914, through the efforts of three organizations which were engaged in collecting funds to relieve the suffering Jewish victims of the World War.89 The J.D.C. has operated in more than 40 countries and has disbursed approximately $84,000,000. The largest sums were expended in behalf of the Jews of Poland, Russia, and Palestine. Prior to 1921, the J.D.C. extended emergency aid. Since 1921, the Com mittee's program has been largely devoted to economic and social rehabilitation. In the Soviet Union the J.D.C. de veloped a large land settlement program, strengthened and supported Jewish mutual aid societies, loan kassas, medical associations, workshops and courses for trade training. In Palestine, it organized the Malaria Research Unit, established the Palestine War Orphans Committee, supported the Loan Bank, Ltd., organized the Central Bank of Cooperative Institutions, contributed to the Hebrew University, and turned over substantial sums to the Palestine Economic Corporation. The J.D.C. established the following per manent organizations for economic aid: the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which has promoted Jewish credit loan work throughout Eastern and Central Europe; the Agro-Joint (American Jewish Joint Agricultural Cor poration), which has initiated and directed land settlement and industrial training activities in the Soviet Union; and the Palestine Economic Corporation, which has developed commercial, industrial, and agricultural undertakings and a large housing program in Palestine. Since the Hitler regime in Germany, the J.D.C. helped the Jewish leaders of that country organize a Central Committee for Relief and Reconstruction, and has subventioned and collaborated with that organization. The J.D.C. likewise participated in the establishment of the High Commission for German Refugees, and has granted substantial sums to refugee aid organizations. It has also cooperated with the Jewish Col onization Association, with the Central British Fund for German Jewry, with HICEM (an organization directing Jewish immigration), and with the major refugee aid com mittees all over the world. During the years 1933, '34, '35, the J.D.C. made appropriations for its programs abroad totalling $2,830,000. The J.D.C. receives its income from</page><page sequence="74">12Q AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK various local campaigns, Welfare Funds, and federation drives. Those who are acquainted with the work and achieve ments of this organization view it, despite such criticisms as may be made of various phases of its work, as the great est single effort on the part of the Jewish people of one country for the welfare of the Jews of other countries, recorded in Jewish history.«0 Closely associated with the Joint Distribution Com mittee from the standpoint of interested personnel though independent in every other way, are two organizations especially designed to meet the needs of German refugees: The Refugee Economic Corporation and the Emigre Char itable Fund, Inc. These organizations aim to deal with the situation created by the Nazis as a result of the mea sures they took against religious and political minorities which deprived large numbers of the means of earning a livelihood and forced them to flee, frequently for their very lives. It became clear that relief alone was insufficient, especially since most countries, because of their own unem ployed, sought to prevent competition by foreign labor. To meet the needs for new outlets, the Refugee Economic Corporation and the Emigre Charitable Fund, Inc. inves tigate and finance economic opportunities throughout the world. The Refugee Economic Corporation, (R.E.C.) is a stock company seeking to make its investments so as to safeguard its principal, wherever possible, while creating employment and other opportunities for refugees. The Emigre Charitable Fund, on the other hand, is ready to undertake expenditures without expectation of repayment. The two organizations have provided a number of loan funds in foreign countries with which independent enter prises are financed thus enabling refugees to make a fresh start. Large colonization projects are also being developed and financed by these funds. Another organization also functioning overseas is the ORT (abbreviation for the Russian name :—Obshtchesvo Re meslenagomeslenago Truda and the French:—Organisation de Recon structionstruction du Travail), founded in 1880. At the close of the World War, ORT began its work in Poland, Roumania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. The program of the ORT is to promote and support trade and vocational education</page><page sequence="75">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 121 among the Jewish masses in Eastern and Central Europe; to maintain and encourage Jewish agricultural activities in the Soviet Union, Poland, Roumania, Latvia and Lith uania ; to assist individual artisans in cooperative enterprises and raise the general level of Jewish work and handicraft. Since the Hitler regime it established a vocational school in Paris and an agricultural colony in the South of France, and is training young German men and women in an agri cultural colony and in trade schools in Lithuania. The ORT has from time to time conducted its own campaigns for funds. In the main, however, it has secured its funds through special arrangements with J.D.C. It is also a ben eficiary of federation and welfare fund drives.91 There are a number of other organizations functioning abroad, such as the Federation of Polish Jews, aiming to aid the Jews in Poland; a similar organization for Roumania; and several organizations that are interested in promoting Jewish settlement in Biro-Bidjan. B. Activities for Palestine There are many organizations in the United States whose activities are exclusively directed to collecting funds and conducting educational work for Palestine. Little more can be done here than to enumerate the most important of them and to indicate briefly their nature and extent. The most important is probably the Zionist Organiza tion of America, which carries on a program of education and propaganda on behalf of Palestine. It has branches in most of the cities in the United States and a number of sub sidiary organizations, all engaged in work for Palestine. Another organization, the American Palestine Campaign, created in 1931, now the United Palestine Appeal, is the fund-raising instrument in the United States for the Jewish Agency for Palestine, (The Keren Hayesod), the Jewish National Fund, (Keren Kayemeth), and the Central Bureau for the Settlement of German Jews in Palestine. The United Palestine Appeal is the successor to a series of fund-raising efforts for Palestine in the United States extending back to 1919.92</page><page sequence="76">122 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK A third organization is the Jewish National Fund of America, which collects funds for the purchase of land in Palestine. It is estimated that up to October 1, 1935, it raised approximately $5,000,000 for this purpose.93 A fourth important organization is Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America. This organization, created in 1912, has almost 500 senior and junior chapters in 274 cities in the country, with a total membership of 45,000. It has thus far engaged primarily in health work in Pales tine, its activities including the maintenance in Palestine of hospitals, clinics, research, medical social service, instruc tion in dietetics in schools, school hygiene, playgrounds, etc. It also conducts an active educational campaign in this country through publications and a speakers bureau for the purpose of interesting Jewish women in Palestine. Recently it undertook the task of building the University Hospital and Post-Graduate Medical School of the Hebrew University in Palestine, in conjunction with the American Jewish Physicians Committee.94 There are a number of other organizations for Palestine, such as the Palestine Economic Corporation, the American Economic Committee for Palestine, American Friends of the Hebrew University, the National Labor Committee for the Jewish Workers in Palestine, the Mizrachi Palestine Fund, the New Zionist Organization (Revisionists), The Jewish State Party, The League for Labor Palestine, Pioneer Women's Organization, and many affiliated youth organizations. While there is no way of determining exactly how much the overseas agencies collect, it may be safely said that on the average about $4,000,000 a year are contributed by American Jewry for purposes of overseas work. In the current year (1937) the J.D.C. and the United Palestine Campaign are each campaigning for about $4,500,000. In 1936, they each campaigned for about $3,500,000 but neither organization reached its goal. In 1934 and 1935 these two organizations conducted a united campaign. If they are successful in raising the $9,000,000 this year, it will be the largest sum American Jewry ever contributed for overeas work during one year. Since both organizations get a large</page><page sequence="77">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 123 portion of their funds from federations and welfare funds, it was necessary to arrive at some arrangement for avoiding the competition and rivalry for appropriations which de veloped in the campaigns of 1936. Accordingly, an agree ment was reached whereby the Joint Distribution Committee is to receive 60% of the funds raised for overseas work and the United Palestine Campaign, (comprising the American Palestine Fund, the Jewish National Fund, The Mizrachi Organization and the Zionist Organization of America) is to receive 40%. This agreement applies only to those cities where a welfare fund or a federation conducts the campaign. X. OTHER ACTIVITIES 1. Social— In addition to the organizations and activities outlined in the foregoing pages, there are a great many which are not usually included among social service agencies but which are, nevertheless, important for the cultural life and social organization of the Jewish people in the United States. A complete picture of organized Jewish life in this country would have to include the less formal organizations for social, cultural and perhaps even political activity. In the first group of organizations,—those organized for social purposes,—might be mentioned the many unaffiliated organizations freqtiently referred to as "ladies societies," but not always limited to women, who carry on philanthropic activities. There are many such organizations in each Jewish community. They not infrequently interfere with the community-wide organizations, but many enlightened professional social workers have worked with them and have secured their cooperation for the advantage of all concerned.93 The lodges and fraternal organizations are mainly organ ized for mutual aid purposes. While it is not known how many such organizations there are and how many members they have, eleven of the largest organizations report a total membership of more than 330,000. These and many other similar organizations perform educational, recreational and insurance functions. In many instances they pay sick and death benefit, maintain institutions to provide for the health</page><page sequence="78">124 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK and recreation of their members, have a socialized type of medical assistance, maintain burial grounds, etc.96 Hundreds of thousands of foreign born Jews belong to Landsmanschaften,Landsmanschaften, societies organized and named in accor dance with the place of birth or old-world residence of the members. The number of these societies, which are found in all cities with a large Jewish population, is not known, although it is estimated that there are several thousand of them. Many of the individual societies are in turn members of one of the several central Landsmanschaften which were organized mainly for the purpose of rendering assistance to the respective Jewish communities abroad. The last decade and a half saw a diminution in the extent and activ ities of these societies. But the increasing Jewish misery abroad in recent years has given them a new lease on life. They are now very actively engaged in all types of relief work and diplomatic intervention. The Federation of Polish Jews, a central organization of Polish Landsman schaften,schaften, is conducting its own campaign for funds for the relief of the Jews in Poland. The Roumanian Jews have a similar organization with similar activities, and a Federation of Galician Jews was organized as late as January, 1937. Most individual Landsmanschaften run joint campaigns with the respective branches of fraternal orders for the relief of the Jews in their native towns and cities. The extent of their activities and collected funds are unknown. The Landsmanschaften,Landsmanschaften, the local branches of fraternal orders, and smaller American relief societies, are now being drawn into local American-Jewish community activities. Many of them participate in the community councils. A great many are active in the Jewish federations of charities and in the various protective organizations. An interesting type of organization is the "family society," composed of members of a given family and their relatives through marriage. There is no information as to how many there are, or what are their activities and programs. But it is known that there are a great many of them. They carry on many social, mutual aid, and philanthropic activ ities. The larger of them provide the same advantages as the lodges and fraternal organizations.97</page><page sequence="79">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 125 A peculiarly American organization is the National Greek Letter Fraternity of college students and alumni. It began as an attempt to meet the need created by the discrimination against Jewish students by the general fraternities and sororities. It is estimated that there are almost 75,000 members in 36 such national Jewish fraternities.98 2. Cultural.—Among the organizations for cultural activ ities must be mentioned the libraries, publication societies, academic societies, theatres, the Yiddish and English-Jewish press, etc. There are nine outstanding libraries largely devoted to the collection of Jewish books, periodicals, manuscripts and ceremonial objects. The leading library is that of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, which has the largest collection of Jewish books and ceremonial objects in the world. The library of the Hebrew Union College, in Cin cinnati, is the second largest. Other important collections worthy of mention are those of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and Yeshiva College in New York City; The American Jewish Historical Society and The Jewish Institute of Religion both in New York City; The Hebrew Theological College in Chicago; The Dropsie Col lege in Philadelphia; The Graduate School for Jewish Social Work in New York; and the recently organized Central Jewish Library and Archives in New York. Mention should also be made of the Jewish collections maintained by the Jewish Division of the New York Public Library, Harvard University, and Yale University. Scholarly activities in the Jewish field are conducted, and their results published, by a number of organizations. Among those worthy of mention are: the American Aca demy for Jewish Research; The American Jewish Historical Society; The Jewish Academy of Arts and Science; The American Section of the Yiddish Scientific Institute; the faculties of several universities, such as Columbia and Har vard; Seminaries, schools, and Rabbinical associations. The Jewish Publication Society of America has published a large number of volumes on various aspects of Jewish life. Its collection constitutes the most important contribution to Jewish literature made by a single organization in this</page><page sequence="80">126 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK country. There are also several other publication agencies, but none can compare with the Jewish Publication Society. TheYiddish and English-Jewish press represents an impor tant influence in Jewish cultural life. There are five Yiddish daily newspapers, about twenty periodicals, and ten or more periodicals using both English and Yiddish. It is estimated, that there are more than 100 English-Jewish periodicals. There are also about ten Hebrew periodicals and one Ladino weekly. The Yiddish theatres, too, are very important in this respect. A recent study (1933)" of the Yiddish theatre in New York City showed that the season opened with nine Yiddish theatres in New York City but five were forced to close before the season was over. The Yiddish Art Theatre was the best known among them. Many of its performancese such as "The Dibbuk," "Yoshe Kalb," "Green Fields," etc., were seen by many non-Jews and were highly praised by the dramatic critics in the general press. It would seem, however, that the Yiddish theatre is not as prosperous today as it was a few years ago. During its heyday it con tributed a number of very fine artists to the English stage. 3. Political.—There are practically no Jewish organiza tions for political purposes. Various attempts have been made from time to time to organize Jewish groups for polit ical activity but these have been repudiated by the Jewish community and have, therefore, never made any real head way. During election campaigns, the political parties, in their efforts at obtaining votes, create Jewish organizations to sponsor their respective candidates, and individual can didates occasionally raise Jewish issues. But it is not long before the Jewish and general public become aware of the motivations and they are repudiated. The Presidential campaign of 1936 is a case in point. The major political parties, such as the Democrats and Republicans, maintain no Jewish organizations except during campaign periods, when they create special speakers' and information bureaus. The radical parties, such as the socialists and communists, do maintain Jewish sections which are more or less active all the time.</page><page sequence="81">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 127 XI. PRESENT TRENDS IN JEWISH SOCIAL WORK IN THE UNITED STATES The foregoing survey would be incomplete without a critical analysis of the present trends and tendencies in Jewish social work. While in general they are similar to the trends in general social work, there are some special prob lems which must be borne in mind in order fully to appre ciate the existing situation. Before embarking upon this analysis it seems necessary to caution the reader that since this is to be a critical analysis of the trends and tendencies, all of which implies interpréta tion, it may no longer be possible to be strictly objective. Something of the writer's point of view must necessarily find its way into the interpretation. However, the aim will be to reduce this to a minimum. Until 1929, and especially since the World War, Jewish social work made enormous progress, qualitatively and quantitatively. It is safe to say that never before in Jewish history, either in this country or elsewhere, has comparable progress been made in Jewish community organization in a like period. It seemed, indeed, as if a golden age were to be inaugurated in this respect, for the Jewish communities in this country. Then came the depression. It brought a serious challenge to Jewish social work. At first it seemed as if Jewish social work were destined for unprecedented expansion because of the depression. As the needs became manifest greater funds were made available for meeting them. Gradually, as the funds from Jewish sources became more limited, additional and larger sums were secured first through non-sectarian drives and later through govern mental subsidy. Expenditures grew by leaps and bounds. Staffs were increased to meet the avalanche of new cases. But Jewish agencies could no more meet the needs with a trained personnel and adequate work than could the non Jewish agencies. Standards were lowered; untrained people were taken on so that in many instances they outnumbered the trained and experienced people ; superficial work became the rule. Discouragement followed in the wake of these conditions.</page><page sequence="82">128 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Several other factors due to the depression must be men tioned here for they may be important influences in deter mining the future of Jewish social work in this country These are: first the developing public social work program; second, the changed attitude of Jewish social workers toward Jewish social work; and third, the economic philosophy of some of the younger Jewish social workers. The deepening depression made it clear that private philanthropy was unequal to the problem which the increas ing unemployment brought in its wake. Many felt that even if private philanthropy were able to deal with the problem, victims of the depression who are able and willing to work but can find none through no fault of their own, should not be forced to apply to charity but should be aided by the government whose duty it is to care for its citizens. Jewish social workers were among the first to express them selves on this score in unmistakable terms at a time when the federal government was most reluctant to recognize that it had any responsibility along those lines.100 Gradually municipalities developed means and set aside funds for caring for the unemployed. The soundness and logic of this development, the inadequate funds available to Jewish agencies from Jewish sources, the inherent dis like that most people have for becoming dependent on private charity, and a constantly diminishing income on the part of federations and community chests made it inevitable that Jewish agencies should welcome this develop ment. Many of them turned over large numbers of their clients to the public agencies, irrespective of the type of care they would receive. In some communities the Jewish agencies were enabled, through a system of compensation and subvention from public funds, to continue to care for their Jewish clients. But this did not always prove to be a satisfactory arrangement, for it meant increases in numbers of clients and staff beyond the agencies' absorptive capacity. It played havoc with existing standards. Whether Jewish agencies kept their clients at first, when the federal government subsidized some private agencies, and turned them over after the federal government decided, in 1933, to work only through public agencies, or whether they turned them over to the public agencies as soon as they</page><page sequence="83">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 129 were created, it soon became clear that the Jewish agencies carried but a small portion of their problem. It became equally clear that without the aid of the public agencies the Jewish organizations could have carried the burden only with great difficulty.101 While, with some, the departure from traditional practice of the Jewish community caring for its dependent population raised questions about the wisdom and desirability of this practice, it seemed to fit in well with the aims and desires of others in the Jewish communities. The contributors saw in it a desirable release from burdens which they were un willing or unable to carry. Some Jewish culturists, who had been finding fault with the Jewish community for spending so much of its substance on the old, the sick, the poor, in a word, the so-called "abnormal" members of the community, saw an opportunity for diverting the funds used for relief to cultural activities. The former, they argued, should be paid for by the state; Jewish funds should be used for "con structive" purposes.102 They did not realize that the Jewish people, or at least the contributing portion of it, had been mostly educated to give for charitable purposes and could not change their outlook overnight. They could not believe that if the state would meet the relief needs, Jews, like other voluntary contributors, would relax in their own giving. Nor did they stop to think that cultural activities had been carried along by campaigns for funds which had emphasized relief needs. If the latter lessened it was to be expected that giving would lessen. And this is precisely what hap pened. Smaller sums became available for communal needs. Relief activities did not suffer materially because they were supplemented from other sources. But educational, recrea tional, cultural and national agencies suffered severely. In many instances their inclusion in federation budgets was questioned, with the result that they were either eliminated or their allowances were drastically reduced. Having thrown in their lot with the federations during prosperous times they were in no position to strike out independently at a time when it was more difficult than ever to raise funds. They, therefore, accepted the inevitable, reduced their activities, frequently to the point of diminishing returns, and hoped for a better day.</page><page sequence="84">]30 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK This was not altogether due to a lack of funds, important a factor as that was. Much more important was the attitude of Jewish social workers, and the lay leaders whom they influence, toward Jewish social work.103 While, strictly speaking, it may be inaccurate to speak of an "attitude," for there is probably no single attitude that would be char acteristic of all, since there is no formulated philosophy of Jewish Jewish social work that would be acceptable to all, any one who knows the situation from first-hand experience and observation knows that not all Jewish social workers are fired with any very great zeal for their work. Nor are they even thoroughly convinced about its necessity, purpose, goal, function, motivation, or future. Some there are who question its value, its justification, its efficacy, and the need for it. They look upon it as a hold-over from an earlier day when it had its justification and need in the isolation of the Jew and when it served also to aid in the survival of the group. Since group survival is not their aim and since isolation is no longer the case and may also be considered undesirable, they can see little justification for it.104 Nor can they see anything distinctively Jewish in Jewish social work. This is particularly true of those who are doing the different types of case work. With the greater profes sionalization of social work and the greater interchange of views and experience between Jewish and non-Jewish social workers due to community chest and other influences, Jewish case workers became more professionally and less Jewishly conscious than their older colleagues were. This meant that they became more interested in the so-called "techniques" of treating their clients than in the "whys" and "wherefores" of their work or in developing the dis tinctive approaches to it. Jewish social work became "social work for," or at best, "with Jews."105 Challenging themselves and being challenged by their non-Jewish colleagues for a raison raison d'être of their work, they gradually abandoned the uncritical acceptance of the work, concepts, and philosophies they had inherited. Since no acceptable philosophies were available and since it was easier to do so, they accepted the view that Jewish social work is a hold-over, a vestigial organ, once of useful function, but becoming less significant and meaningful with the passage of time and greater Jewish</page><page sequence="85">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 131 inter-penetration, co-mingling, and participation in the com mon life. This view was strengthened by the influx of large numbers of college-trained men and women who were accustomed to think of social problems in general economic or sociological terms and who had neither the interest, knowledge nor inclination to seek out or develop for themselves a specifically Jewish point of view. It became fashionable to question the Jewish aspects or values of Jewish social work. The leaders sought contacts with non-Jewish social workers first, because it is the natural thing to do, second, because non Jewish recognition means enhanced status in the Jewish group. A by no means negligible factor in this process was the fact that non-Jewish social work, because of its size, differentiation, and greater degree of professionalization, had something to offer which the Jewish group lacked— technical consideration of case work problems on a profes sional level. Hence they sought non-Jewish affiliation. The pace set by the leaders or executives was eagerly followed by staff members, for the same forces operated with them, plus the natural tendency to imitate and emulate one's chief. This was the ruling attitude among case workers except in the very few instances where the executive was interested in, or sought to develop, the Jewish aspects of case work. But these were so rare that their influence was insufficient to stem the tide. The situation is somewhat different among federation executives. The very nature of their work forces them to think and speak in terms of "the Jewish Community." Although it may be doubted whether many federation executives have a very clear idea as to what they mean by "the Jewish Community"106 they constantly speak about and some undoubtedly come to believe in it. "The Jewish Com munity" is for them a sort of anthropomorphic being. They speak of it as if it possessed the human attributes of think ing, feeling and willing. It has wishes and desires, it approves and disapproves, it grants and withholds its bounty as it is satisfied or dissatisfied with given programs, procedures and practices. Jewish social work becomes to them an expression of this rather mystical "Community."</page><page sequence="86">132 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK But even they, who are under constant pressure to think and formulate the larger and perhaps more fundamental purposes and values of Jewish social work, have produced little that may be considered a guide for those who may wish to develop a philosophy of Jewish social work in the United States. Whatever has been written is in the most general terms.107 Nothing has thus far come even from this group which the more specialized social workers might apply to their own work. There are instances where specialized workers who were not particularly known for their interest, zeal or advocacy of the Jewish phases of social work became active propagandists for a so-called Jewish emphasis when they became federation executives. On the other hand, there are some rather notable instances where federation executives, who argued in and out of season for a specifically Jewish social work and the application of Jewish values to it, abandoned all attempts at such applications on leaving the federation field. More recently, within the past three or four years, a new factor has arisen in the field of Jewish social work, which threatened to become the most disorganizing of all—the radical activities of the younger group of Jewish social work ers. These consist mainly in the organization of what amounts to industrial unions of all employees in Jewish social agencies and in carrying on a type of propaganda which characterizes radical groups and movements. The causes for this develop ment may be found in the economic and social background, education, and experience of a great many of the workers; in the absence of a well-defined philosophy of Jewish life and of Jewish social work in the United States; in a loss of confidence in the lay and professional leadership; in the ,stresses and strains induced by social work during the depres sion; in a belief that much if not most of the maladjustment with with which social workers have to deal has an economic base and can only be adequately treated through a readjustment or reorganization of the economic basis of society;108 and finally in a series of reductions of salaries of employees of Jewish social agencies since the depression. The last may well well be considered the precipitating cause, for it was the opposition to salary reductions and efforts to obtain rein statement of the original salaries that brought the move</page><page sequence="87">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 133 ment to the fore and gave the heterogeneous elements which composed it the feeling of common interest and purpose necessary for a successful movement.109 Members of this group look upon themselves as "workers." They secured a charter from the American Federation of Labor. Efforts to get them to view Jewish social work as a profession devoted to "social services," incompatible with the con flict philosophy and methods of labor organizations and especially the more radical ones, and the peculiar and spe cial responsibility that rests or should rest upon Jewish social workers to act responsibly in order not to bring dis credit upon the Jewish group, are scorned and ridiculed. Their interest is in the larger group. The Jewish problem, to them, insofar as they give it any thought at all, is an expression, a function, of the general economic problem and will be solved only when the problems of the total population are solved. Hence their emphasis on the larger scene. This movement is not limited to New York City, although the leading group is to be found there. Similar groups with similar interests and activities are to be found in other large cities.111 Quite aside from the inevitable diffusion in interest and effort with respect to Jewish social work as such, which this movement means, it affects Jewish social work adversely in the loss of interest and good-will on the part of Jewish lay leaders. It has also induced unfriendly attitudes in non-Jewish social workers and their leaders toward Jewish social work and Jewish social workers. Although some of the most important leaders of the movement are non-Jews, the facts that it had its origin as an organized endeavor in the Jewish group, and that some prominent Jewish social workers are among its leaders, have served to identify the Jewish group with its activities. In the past year or two, a new and in some respects opposi tionaltional group came into being among the younger Jewish social workers which bids fair to become popular, as its ideals and principles become better formulated and wider known. The basic philosophy of this group is that of Labor Zionism. While they support the trade-union interest and approach of social workers, they oppose what they consider the assimilationist tendencies of the more radical social</page><page sequence="88">134 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK work group as well as other Jewish groups. They differ from the ordinary Labor-Zionists in their search for a program which would emphasize Jewish life in America without neglecting the upbuilding of Palestine. In ideology they are closely related to the adherents of the "Reconstruction ist" philosophy of Jewish life.112 These are some of the forces now at work. It is doubtful whether, with the exception of the last named group, they promise the most wholesome development of Jewish social work or Jewish life. They have in fact already served to weaken both in many directions, if not to undermine them. We need only look at the present status of some of the functional fields to see how true this is. Enough has been said in the foregoing pages to indicate the seriousness of the situation for the family welfare societies and indeed for all case work agencies. Though this type of social work is in no immediate danger from the lack of a clientele that needs to be served, or even from a lack of funds, it faces grave dangers from within and without. In its failure to develop a distinctive philosophy and approach to its work, in its failure to discover and emphasize the Jewish or cultural aspects of its work; in its turning over to the public agencies large numbers of its clients to be handled by untrained or inadequately trained people with low standards of work; in the loss of many of its trained and experienced workers to the public agencies ; in the radical attitudes and activities of some of its workers, Jewish family care or case work appears to be losing ground, prestige, and the compelling appeal it had for the Jewish public. Whether it is called upon to take back a large number of those who are now being handled by the public agencies, (not an impos sible development in view of the known attitudes of impor tant public officials and spokesmen of the large taxpayers and recently adopted policies regarding relief on the part of the Federal government) or whether it eventually settles down to the handling of only those who are ineligible to public funds, Jewish family work will probably have a more difficult time to justify itself in the future than it has had in the past. There will seem less justification for the main tenance of separate Jewish family societies because of what has transpired during the last few years. Unless they develop</page><page sequence="89">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 135 a raison d'être that will be sufficiently compelling in word and deed to make a critical and unwilling contributing public realize that in supporting them they are maintaining a a service that is essential and has a distinctive contribution to make to the general as well as the Jewish community, Jewish family case work agencies, and for that matter, all Jewish agencies, may suffer a severe set-back in their pro gram and activities. That the Jewish family care agencies are aware of some of these problems and are trying to deal with them, goes without saying.113 But it may be doubted whether they have thus far analyzed and faced them in fundamental terms. Such analysis would have to include not only the quantity and quality of their work and the adequacy of the support rendered them by federations, but also what their function and scope should be in a scheme of Jewish com munity organization. It should answer the questions how they are prepared to meet their problems as Jewish agencies, and how they differ from the general case work agencies, public and private, which may serve as large if not larger numbers of Jewish clients than do the Jewish agencies. Unless they succeed in doing this and find a real justifica tion for themselves, it is not impossible that they will be destroyed. In fact they now carry in themselves the seeds of their own destruction. For in addition to the factors al ready outlined, many case workers, case work executives, and board members have assimilationist tendencies. Some are convinced assimilationists. This is especially true of some of the Board members. They are frequently encour aged by the case work group to look upon Jewish agencies and their work as separatist endeavors which should be discouraged. It is but a step from the adoption of such a philosophy for general Jewish agencies to its execution in the agencies with which they are associated. Family agency executives holding such views do not see the consequences to their own work. But, here as everywhere, the tragedy is that it will not be they alone who will suffer from their blindness, but the entire Jewish community. The institutional phases of social work, such as the agencies for the care of the sick, the aged, and children, are in a some what better position.114 While they were all effected by the</page><page sequence="90">136 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK depression and the factors outlined, they suffered less, com paratively, than did the other types of work, especially the educational and recreational agencies. The latter were and, in some instances, still are in a most precarious state. They were the hardest hit of any of the fields of Jewish social work. They not only lost ground but had to fight for their very existence. And it cannot be said that the struggle is over. The same may be said of the national agencies. It will depend upon how long this depression will last and upon the rate of recovery whether these agencies, especially those that have a cultural program, will survive or not. If they survive it is likely to take a long time before they will reach once again the position they occupied, or the quality of work they did at the onset of the depression. But it is the federations that are facing the greatest chal lenge and severest test. Many factors conspired to weaken them. Federations, as a rule, obtained their greatest power through the purse rather than from the sanctions resulting from constructive and representative leadership. With a more limited purse has, therefore, come a diminution of power and influence. Federations have been accused of being arbitrary, undemocratic, near-sighted, timid or cow-. ardly, visionless, interested mainly in charity, leaderless, provincial, mechanical in their approach and method, dom inated by an assimilationist point of view, being supported by and appealing to comparatively small numbers, and as having failed to develop the cohesiveness, organization, and other characteristics of an intelligent, wisely planned and representative Jewish community. While all these charges cannot be leveled at all federations, it must be admitted that most federations have some of these shortcomings, and that some of them would have to plead guilty to most or all of the charges if they had the necessary objectivity and insight to see themselves as they are seen by others.115 There is some evidence that some of the more thoughtful lay and professional federation leaders are becoming increas ingly aware of the shortcomings and dangers faced by federa tions. Some beginnings have been made in the direction of a re-examination of the purpose, function, scope, method, form of organization, and future of federation."6 While such soul-searching as is taking place in federation may be</page><page sequence="91">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 137 expected to yield constructive results, one cannot expect too much since the patient, himself, does the examining, the diagnosing, the prescribing, and the treating. Indeed, the very factors responsible for their defects may easily prevent federations from viewing themselves as they are and may nullify, in large measure, the efforts at reorganization. But be that as it may, it is freely admitted that the federation is not the Jewish community, and that it would have to be fundamentally reconstructed if it were to become the Jewish community. The Community Councils, discussed else where, represent one attempt at creating such a représenta tive Jewish community organization. But they have some of the vices of their virtues and may perhaps even threaten the very structure of federations unless they are wisely planned and even more wisely conducted. Nevertheless, when all is said and done, federation is the most important single organization in the Jewish com munity. It has in it elements of strength, at least potential strength, which no other organization in the Jewish com munity has. In its representativeness, unrepresentative as it is; in its community-mindedness, narrowly conceived as it may be; in its financial resources, limited as they are; in its leadership, one-sided and conservative as that may be; in its catholicity of interests, circumscribed as they are said to be; and in its status before the non-Jewish world, there lie possibilities heretofore unrealized and assuredly unequalled by any existing Jewish organization in the United States. How to tap these resources and how to convert the federation into the comprehensive community organization which seems to be the present need and which, better than any other existing organization, it can become, is the problem. Indeed, this is the greatest need faced by Jewish social work. In a sense it is the central problem of Jewish community organization in the United States.</page><page sequence="92">138 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Notes and References The number reporting Yiddish as their mother tongue were: for 1910,—1,051,767; 1920,—1,091,820; 1930,—1,222,658.

"Of all the religious bodies the Jews alone have refrained from establishing institu tions of higher learning. Their only colleges have been primarily theological, such as the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, Dropsie College in Philadelphia and The Yeshiva College</page><page sequence="95">COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 141 in New York which recently began to do work of collegiate grade. Jewish students attend not only the state and non-sectarian institutions, but also the various insti tutions connected with Christian denominations, both Protestant and Catholic. There is some feeling, both in Jewish and Gentile circles, that it might be desirable for the Jews to develop institutions of their own, especially since many private institutions have sought to establish a numerus clausus for Jews. In one of the largest Catholic universities in the East 56.7 % of the student body consists of Jews." 84 An excellent description of the older types of Jewish education is contained, n Gamoran, Emanuel: Changing Conceptions in Jewish Education.
