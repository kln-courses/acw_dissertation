<plain_text><page sequence="1">Going beyond James: A pragmatic argument for God's existence L. STAFFORD BETTY California State University, Bakersfield, California, USA ±§L International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 49: 69-84,2001. ^r\ ^T © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. Introduction The argument developed here can be found in a very rough way in the writings of William James. It is likely that thoughtful or perceptive believers around the world have used it for centuries to shore up their belief in God and reli- gion, though not in any formally philosophical way. Probably it would be better to call it, for these, not an argument, but a commonsensical, perhaps universal intuition. What I will argue here is that the intuition is sound and that an argument for the existence of God can be embroidered around it. I can think of no better name for it than the Pragmatic Argument. The Pragmatic Argument in its simple form (as opposed to its refined form, to be developed near the end of the paper) can be stated as a syllogism: 1. For any two sets of beliefs R and S which cannot both be true, if R produces more good for those who accept R than S does for those who accept S (all other things being equal), then R is more likely true than S. 2. More good comes to people living out of a set of religious beliefs R, especially including belief in some form of divine reality, than out of an opposing set of purely secular beliefs S. 3. Therefore, R is more likely true than S. The argument can be restated less technically: 1 . When good comes to us, our actions and attitudes are more likely based on a true grasp of the situation than a false. 2. Much more good grows out of religious convictions - especially including belief in some form of divine reality - than out of purely secular convictions. 3. Therefore it is very likely that a religious viewpoint - especially including belief in some form of divine reality - is more true than a purely secular viewpoint.</page><page sequence="2">70 L. STAFFORD BETTY James's version of the argument In most of his religious writing, James stops well short of the argument defended here. As most know, he has a profound sympathy for any religious belief that brings some "vital good" to the believer. "Vital good" encom- passes what social scientists today call "life satisfaction" - the feeling of being loved, the ability to achieve meaningful goals, the sense that life is on the whole worth living. "Vital good" includes psychological wholeness, moral sensitivity, and material success in life. But more especially for James it includes the goods of saintliness and mysticism. The saint - Mother Teresa would be a good example - is both happy in her saintliness and an inspiration to her society. The mystic - James quotes St. Teresa of Avila at length in The Varieties of Religious Experience - is the most blessed of persons, for her experiences are marked by an indescribable ecstasy and a tremendous sense of well-being. Both saint and mystic typically owe their blessedness to their religious beliefs and experiences, and James does not hesitate to say in Varieties that these beliefs, centered on the Divine, are true, and true precisely because they yield vitally good results.1 But isn't that exactly my argument? It is not. For in many places James seems to equate truth with workability; what one believes in might not corre- spond to reality at all. In other words, there is a sense in which truth for him is purely psychological; truth can be the property a statement has when it yields some vital good. And the saint's or mystic's belief in God certainly yields a vital good. Therefore it is true. True for the saint or mystic. My argument, on the other hand, uses the word "truth" in the conventional sense. Truth is the quality a statement has when it corresponds to a fact or a reality. Truth so understood is not psychological, but ontological.2 It is important to add that James's notions of God, immortality, and a morality based on free will - the three notions he is most concerned to defend3 - are exceedingly broad, purposely indefinite, and generic. He certainly has no interest in defending any particular version of these beliefs. "The ultimate philosophy," he says, "must not be too strait-laced in form, must not in all its parts divide heresy from orthodoxy by too sharp a line."4 It is impossible in so short a space to do justice to the subtleties of James's thought, especially his indebtedness to Darwin's evolutionary theory.5 He has been made here to seem more orderly and perhaps less vague than he really is.6 It will have to suffice if this brief discussion of James reveals a nascent argument that is the germ of my own.</page><page sequence="3">GOING BEYOND JAMES 7 1 The argument FIRST PREMISE: For any two sets of beliefs R and S which cannot both be true, if R produces more good for those who accept R than S does for those who accept S (all other things being equal), then R is more likely true than S. This part of the argument can be tested only through experience, and we must resort to illustrations to see if our confidence in the premise grows or wanes. Here are a few. If clients who follow the advice of Stockbroker A consistently make more money than clients who follow Stockbroker B, then A's advice must reflect reality better than B's. If college students who act as if it is more important to study than play succeed better in life than students who act as if it is more important to play than study, then the study-philosophy is closer to reality than the play-philosophy. If explorers who believe the world is round make more discoveries than those who believe it is flat, then the round- world theory is closer to the truth than the flat- world theory. If Diogenes the Cynic, who held that society was a web of deceit and hypocrisy from top to bottom and avoided human contact, was happier than the people he despised, then that would mean his cynical view of human nature was truer than the more optimistic view enjoyed by his supposedly deluded contemporaries. If people who strive to live by the Golden Rule are happier on the whole and over the long run than those who dismiss it as so much romantic rubbish, then the Golden Rule would be a truer moral law than one based on ethical egoism. If habitual truth-speakers are happier and more prosperous on the whole than habitual liars, then truth-speaking would reflect a moral law that it would be unwise to ignore. But if liars are more prosperous and happy on the whole, then it would be the other way round. In a world of winners and losers, the philosophy guiding the behavior of the winners, I believe, is on the whole a closer reflection of the way things truly are than the philosophy guiding the behavior of the losers. I cannot prove the truth of this statement - it is not a law we can completely depend on - but the examples cited above point to its truth rather forcefully. Taken together they may be regarded as a heuristic device pointing to a potential law: A person's success and happiness are based to a very great degree on his or her ability to grasp reality, and a person's lack of success and loss of happiness are based to a very great degree on his or her failure to grasp reality. But there is a potentially fatal objection to this first premise, and we must face it squarely. Nietzsche held that lies and illusions are necessary to support life; they are useful. Many thoughtful people have agreed with him, so much</page><page sequence="4">72 L. STAFFORD BETTY so that the meaning of the phrase "useful fiction" is grasped at once by everyone. Now if fictions are as useful on the whole and over the long run as truths, then our First Premise fails. Are carefully crafted fictions on the whole as useful as the truth, perhaps even more useful? Are they frequently the lesser of two evils, the greater being the truth? Let us consider four examples to help us answer the question. A very pervasive example of an apparently useful fiction is Santa Claus. I have played the Santa Claus game with my children, and probably most of you have too. Did more happiness come to us and our children because we indulged this "useful fiction" than would have come if we had not? If so, then, according to our premise, Santa Claus should be real - which of course is absurd. I do not think this challenge is as trenchant as it first seems. What is accomplished by this myth? What does Santa Claus represent to the child? If Santa is nothing more than a jolly old guy in a red suit who brings gifts to good children at Christmas, then we would be wise to rid our society of such nonsense for everyone's sake. On the other hand, if he is a generous, loving being who lives far away in a mysterious country and travels through the air all over the world in a single night giving gifts to good children, then he might be the closest thing to a benevolent God that a very young child can grasp. If so, then what is useful for the child about the Santa Claus myth, with its feeling of mystery tinged with joy and fear, might not be its fictive quality but its truth. Looked at this way, it is possible that young children who are Santa Claus believers are well served not because they have been influenced by a useful fiction, but a truth. Santa Claus may be their earliest introduction to a divine reality. A potential problem arises, of course, when the child is finally told that Santa Claus doesn't really exist, or realizes on her own that her parents and not Santa brought the gifts. But is there really a problem? By that time the child is older and has tasted enough of the worm to begin to suspect that the story is preposterous. By now Santa no longer carries sacred associations; he is no longer the same being in the mind of the child that he once was. In a word, he is a fiction and nothing but a fiction. And there is nothing convenient or useful in the least about such a fiction. As far as I can see, it is useless precisely because it is seen to be, and is, fictitious. Our premise stands. Here is a second example. Some of us raised as Roman Catholics grew up with a very different kind of "useful fiction," one that had a profound impact on our behavior and general outlook on life. I refer to the belief in eternal hell for "mortal sins." In my teen years I had such fear of the consequences of certain sexual sins, defined as mortal, that I refrained from committing them! I suspect that a few of the priests who counseled me knew very well that they</page><page sequence="5">GOING BEYOND JAMES 73 were gulling me, but that it was for my own good. And in a certain sense it was. It kept me from being sexually predatory like some of my more cynical peers, and it kept me from contracting a sexual disease. But it is obvious to me now that it did me more harm than good. It turned God into a being more feared than loved, and it slowed my growth into an ethically sensitive young man by placing dogma and authority over reason and healthy experimenta- tion. Finally, once I saw through the charade, it created such a revulsion that I rebelled irrationally against everything the Church stood for, the good as well as the bad. There are several compelling reasons for teenagers to put off sex, but one of them is not God's wrath. The morbid fear of going to hell for masturbation or "impure thoughts" has been the butt of countless jokes from many quarter and is an embarrassment to the modern Church, as well it should be. This "useful fiction" has been found wanting, and the modern Church has rejected it. Again, our premise stand. Another "useful fiction" still indulged is the withholding of truth from a dying person about her illness. The excuse is usually that the dying person could not handle the truth and that a frank discussion of her condition would only add to her misery. In recent years this sort of charade has come under heavy fire. Dr. Sherwin Nuland, author of How We Die, a National Book Award winner, writes that such a fiction denies the dying and her family "a final sharing that might have snatched an enduring comfort and even some dignity from the anguishing fact of death."7 Most doctors today, unlike a generation ago, agree they are morally obligated to share the truth with the dying. They have gradually come to realize that on the whole more good comes to their patients when they are told the truth than when they are protected from the truth by a "useful fiction." In other words, there is a corre- lation between living out of the truth and dying a good death. Once again, our premise stands. A different kind of potentially "useful fiction" is the lie told to Nazi inter- rogators trying to learn the whereabouts of Jews hidden away. Obviously the Nazis should be lied to. This case, however, is different in nature from the cases reviewed above. Believing in Santa Claus, believing in a wrathful God, and believing one's sickness is not terminal when it is, structure the believer's overall life orientation. The Nazis' belief about the whereabouts of victims does not. We are concerned here about "useful fictions" only insofar as they structure a person's life orientation - as do religious beliefs. Fictions that distance a person's belief system from the truth are, I suspect, almost never useful. I have given only three examples above that support this contention, but it would be easy to give dozens if space permitted. On the basis of such examples, it seems likely that the closer to the truth a belief is, the more likely some good will come out of it. And, conversely, the greater the</page><page sequence="6">74 L. STAFFORD BETTY good that comes from a belief, the more likely that the belief is true. Fictions may be convenient, even useful, in the short run or in a narrow sense, but they are almost never helpful, I have tried to show, in the long run and in a broad sense. I hold that the First Premise, which correlates truth with success and happiness, has a great deal of evidence in its favor and is very probably true. In any case, the burden of proof rests at this point, I believe, on the opposition. SECOND PREMISE: More good comes to people living out of a set of religious beliefs Ry especially including belief in some form of divine reality, than out of an opposing set of purely secular beliefs S. We must turn to the social sciences, including scientific pollsters, and to the medical sciences to see the truth of this Premise. We will be trying to gauge the impact of religion on great masses of unremarkable people, most of them alive today. University social scientists have provided a great deal of support for our thesis. "Researchers at Southern California College in Costa Mesa found elderly persons who are religiously active tend to be more optimistic and better able to cope with illness than people who are less religious,"8 reported the Los Angeles Times. Researchers studying coping mechanisms found that "cancer patients who reported that God was in control of their lives were rated by their nurses as significantly less upset, and reported higher self-esteem"; they rated faith as "the single most effective coping strategy in dealing with loss events, especially the death of a loved one."9 Researchers at Brigham Young University studying delinquency in LDS adolescents found that "the more frequent the private religious behavior [reading scriptures, praying privately, reading church magazines] and the stronger the feelings of being accepted in the local congregation, the lower was the level of delinquency."10 Two Chicago-area researchers working with over a thousand Northern Illinois University students found that "religiosity was positively associated with wellness [self-actualization, health responsibility, exercise, nutrition, inter- personal support, and stress management] and inversely associated with a number of health-compromising behaviors and illnesses [smoking, drinking, injuries, illnesses, drug use, and failure to use seat belts]."11 The Univer- sity of Michigan "conducted a study of the Afro-American community and discovered the strongest predictor of emotional well-being was religious participation, not health, income, family or educational level."12 All this has led two sociologists affiliated with Indiana State University to conclude: "All of the past studies that looked at religiosity and life satisfaction came to the same conclusion - those persons who attend church experience greater life satisfaction and are better adjusted than those who do not."13</page><page sequence="7">GOING BEYOND JAMES 75 Almost everywhere one looks in the social sciences, one finds this corre- lation between life satisfaction and health on the one hand, and religiosity on the other. When religion is not positively associated with well-being and health - as occasionally happens - the cause usually lies in one departure or another from the generic type of religion that we will be concerned with below. For example, when fear of damnation is unusually strong and results in paralyzing guilt, or when certain medical practices, such as blood transfu- sions, are forbidden by one's faith, the usual correlations between religion, on the one hand, and health, happiness, and good citizenship, on the other, might not show up. As supportive of our Second Premise as these university-based studies are, they are perhaps less telling than the latest research coming from medical science. David Larson, a psychiatrist who is president of the National Institute for Healthcare Research, speaks for thousands of doctors when he says, "A healthy pursuit of spirituality improves a person's health, not only mentally but physically."14 Larry Dossey, a former Dallas internist, now a writer, makes the same point when he says, "The plain facts are that people who pray in their lives live longer and feel better."15 All told, there were about 200 clinical studies examining the impact of religion on health conducted in the U.S. between the mid-1980s and mid- 1990s, and "160 showed positive effects of religious commitment on health, while only 15 showed negative effects."16 Taken as a group, they showed, according to Larson, that religiously committed people "of all income levels are healthier, live longer and have better sex lives and happier marriages" than uncommitted people. "They even die easier. Because they receive spir- itual comfort, they require less-expensive medical care in their last year of life."17 The findings of many of these studies were made known in December 1995 at a week-long course conducted by the Harvard Medical School titled "Spirituality and Healing in Medicine," with 800 doctors, nurses, clinicians, scholars, and chaplains attending. Steven Kosslyn, a Harvard neurologist and professor of psychology, spoke for the majority when he concluded: "No one could sit through all those panels on healing and think this is nothing, that there is no relation between spirituality and healing."18 This brings us to the final kind of evidence supporting our Second Premise: the results of polls. The Princeton Religion Research Center, a non- profit offshoot of the Gallup Organization, has regularly supplied Americans with surveys about American religion. What does Gallup's number-crunching reveal? It reveals the same correlation between religiosity and well-being that the social and medical studies show. It "suggests ties between religious commit-</page><page sequence="8">76 L. STAFFORD BETTY ment and self-esteem, optimism, and health."19 Noteworthy is Gallup's research on deeply committed Christians. He calls them the "saints among us" and estimates their number to be no more than 10 percent of the Chris- tian population. "These people," he says, "are a breed apart. They are more tolerant of people of diverse backgrounds. They are more involved in chari- table activities. They are more involved in practical Christianity. They are absolutely committed to prayer." And they are "far, far happier than the rest of the population. These are the quiet saints in our society who have a disproportionate impact on our communities."20 More recently he surveyed Americans who reported having at least one religious or spiritual experience. These experiences included "conversion, near-death episodes, and revelations from the beauty of nature."21 In an inter- view with The New York Times, Gallup said that a third of Americans have had one or more such experience and that it "leads people in a positive direction, causes them to fear death less, brings them closer together."22 All of the above evidences - coming to us from university social scientists, medical providers, and pollsters - make a powerful case for the beneficial influence of religion on individuals, especially when the religion is open and tolerant, theologically broad and inclusive, and is based more on universal spiritual experience and less on exclusionary dogma. CONCLUSION: Therefore, R is more likely true than S. This conclusion follows once the two premises are established. The argument is formally valid. To summarize, we have seen that when good comes, the action or attitude resulting in the good is usually grounded on a correct grasp of the facts, and that when misfortune results, a misunderstanding of the facts is usually behind the misfortune. In almost every sphere of life this apparent rule seems to apply. Then we saw that religion brings about much good: It gives meaning to life, it generates a sense of well-being, it encourages good citizenship and a morally responsible way of life, it inspires courage in the face of danger, and it ameliorates both physical and mental health. It follows, therefore, that since so much good comes from religion, the pivotal belief in some kind of divine reality that most religion is based on is very likely true. Refinement of the argument So far so good. But now we confront a serious challenge to our thesis. Religion, for all the good it does, also does much harm. The crusades, the Inquisition, the mutual killing of Catholics and Protestants in Northern</page><page sequence="9">GOING BEYOND JAMES 77 Ireland, the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people by Islamic terrorists in Algeria - these and countless other displays of religious intoler- ance or fanaticism show that religion can be a crucible of human suffering on a massive scale. How do we protect our Second Premise against such damning and undeniable evidence? Certainly not by denying the facts of history. We protect ourselves by pointing out that the hatred producing all this misery does not arise from generic religious beliefs common to most faiths, but from exclusivist idio- syncrasies unique to only one that obscure the commonalities and encourage we-they thinking. Examples of such idiosyncracies include the beliefs that there is no salvation outside Jesus, or that the Jews are uniquely "chosen" by God, or that a true Muslim can resort to violent "holy war" under certain conditions, or that God ordained four castes only, or that the Japanese are alone descended from the gods. These beliefs, and many more like them, have led to attitudes of superiority, self-congratulation, exclusivism, and intoler- ance; and these in turn have led too often to persecution and outright war. In other words, exclusivist religious attitudes have generated an enormous amount of misery in the world. But these narrow-minded attitudes, beliefs, and experiences are not generic; they are not universals. Religious sages like Thomas Merton or the Dalai Lama have pointed out that the deeper one's experience of what James called "the MORE" - a generic way of naming Divine Reality - the less likely religious idiosyncracies of an exclusivist nature will maintain their hold. Since the deadliest form of intolerance usually begins with too narrow or explicit a view of the Divine, James's MORE needs more looking at. James defined it as "a MORE of the same quality [as the believer's deepest and best self], which is operative in the universe outside [the believer], and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a fashion get on board of and save himself when all his lower being has gone to pieces in the wreck."23 A less vague but still generic definition of the Divine comes from Emerson, who wrote: "We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity."24 It would be wrong to think that a generic God is unapproachable and unlovable. The anonymous Christian writer of The Cloud of Unknowing, a highly regarded 14th-century guide- book for aspiring mystics, stated that God was undefinable and unthinkable: "By love he may be gotten and held; but by thinking, never."35 Indeed the greatest lovers of the Divine - the world's mystics - typically insist that words utterly pale beside the Reality they ecstatically commune with. Unfortunately, conventional conceptions of the Divine are almost always more particularistic - less generic - than the mystic's: the Muslim's Allah, the Buddhist's Clear Light, the Christian's Jesus, the Hindu's Shiva, the Confucian's Heaven, the</page><page sequence="10">78 L. STAFFORD BETTY Native American's Great Spirit, and even the God of classical theism, to name only a few. And they tend to create havoc in our world when they are insisted on too literally, for the one favored conception abrogates all the others. And, as we know, disdain, intolerance, and war can be the result. The best the world can hope for, realistically, is not that particularistic theologies and myths will change anytime soon, but that gradually literalism will loosen its hold. Teachers who compare religions in the classroom often see some of their students grow out of their literalism, and the result is usually felicitous. The key to this growth is not the overthrow of religion, but the growing sense that particularistic theologies and myths are guideposts rather than boundary stakes. As religious people of the future (let us suppose) increasingly adopt this point of view, the religions to which they belong will begin to foster a generic spirit. In other words, they will encourage respect for representations of the Divine that are at first alien, and they will be able to do this only because they humbly sense that the Divine resists every attempt at precise definition. It is this more generic vision of the Divine - and the kind of religion that grows out of it - that our argument in its refined form (to be spelled out below) deals with. It is not just any religion, in other words, that brings good things into the world and is therefore, according to our pragmatic standard, probably true. Rather it is this more universal and therefore more tolerant form of religion - what we have been calling "generic religion." "Generic religion" is not some new religion. One can be a generic Christian or Buddhist of Muslim. A "genericist" is simply a Christian or Buddhist or Muslim who recognizes or at least suspects that other ways of thinking about and telling stories about and worshipping the Divine are as valid as his own. It is this sort of religious person who not only brings good to himself in the ways pointed out above by the social and medical sciences, but brings good as well to the world by his tolerance of and even respect for what is less familiar or comfortable. I do not mean to imply that there are no differences between generic Christianity, for example, and generic Buddhism. I mean to say that what they have in common is, using our pragmatic calculus, very likely true. And what do they, one theistic and the other non-theistic, have in common? A deep sense of spiritual reality, of a presently insensible reality unimaginably more beautiful, compassionate, and ultimate than those we have encountered on earth. A sense that our ethical choices are much more important, and have far richer consequences, than most of us guess. A sense that we are an enormous reservoir of untapped potentiality and that we have destinies stretching far beyond this world. This list could be embellished, but not by much. Too much embellishment would lead us away from the generic, the universal. And it is</page><page sequence="11">GOING BEYOND JAMES 79 the generic that is the lodestone of our present excitement, for it alone has a good chance of being true. The Hindu philosopher Radhakrishnan says: "The seers describe their experiences with an impressive unanimity. They are 'near to one another on mountains farthest apart.'"26 It is hard to imagine that the horrors of reli- gion referred to above could be fostered by a generic outlook and spiritual experience leading to a convergence of understanding and definition. All these considerations require us to develop a refined version of the argument offered in its simple form on the first page. Here is the Pragmatic Argument in its refined, and final, form: 1. For any two sets of beliefs R and S, which cannot both be true, if R produces more good for those who accept R than S does for those who accept S (all other things being equal), then R is more likely true than S. 2. More good comes to people living out of a set of religious beliefs R that foster tolerance, especially including a generic understanding of divine reality, than out of an opposing set of purely secular beliefs S. 3. Therefore, R is more likely true than S. Challenges and prospects I believe that this argument can be used to bolster or enfeeble almost any kind of claim, and I will suggest below a few examples that might be of interest to readers of this journal. But first let us look at three challenges to the argument. Suppose someone were to say, "Well, religious beliefs may have some good effects, but the fact of the matter is that what a generic religion asks me to believe just doesn't square with what I know about the slaughter bench of history (Hegel) or the indifference of the cosmos (Sartre or Camus)." This challenge underscores the modesty of the present argument. Keep in mind that a generic theology resists defining God too cleanly, and therefore the classical problem of evil that arises from defining God as omnipotent and omnibenevolent does not necessarily arise for the genericist. Nevertheless, it would be natural for geneticists to assume that because they get so much good from their religion, the Divine Hub of it must be able to make good things happen. But I see no reason for them to insist that only good things happen. In any case, the theodicist's task is not canceled by the Pragmatic Argument, just rendered less crucial. A second challenge might be this: "Well, you made awfully short work of those secular competitors! They have tremendous variety and subtlety, you know, just as religious beliefs do. How can you be so sure that a devout materialist or atheist would likely be less happy and prosperous than a devout</page><page sequence="12">80 L. STAFFORD BETTY genericist? Aren't you just a bit too smug?" This challenge underscores the need for social scientists and pollsters to refine future surveys. What has emerged so far is that people in general are happier and more prosperous when they are religious than not. But what about contemporary Marxists like the Brazilian philosopher Paulo Freire or contemporary humanist philos- ophers like Thomas Nagel or Robert Nozick or contemporary existentialists like the thoughtful colleagues across the hall from me? They appear to be as robustly committed to their philosophies as the saints to their religions. If the Pragmatic Argument is to appeal to philosophers, it would be helpful to compare pure types. Level of commitment - to anything - might emerge as the best predictor of happiness and prosperity. And that finding would scuttle our argument. I suspect, however, that the deeper and more thoughtful one's commitment to secularism on the one hand and to one's religion, especially if it is generic, on the other, the greater the difference between the two in terms of happiness and prosperity, with the advantage to the religious believer. But this definitely needs to be demonstrated, not assumed. A final challenge might go like this: "You keep talking about individual happiness and prosperity. Granted that individuals get something good from religion, but what about the society they live in? Can you show that believers on balance do more good for their society than non-believers?" This chal- lenge is perhaps the most difficult of all to meet, for people differ on what constitutes societal good. Who has done the world more good, Bill Gates or Mother Teresa? Albert Einstein or Mahatma Gandhi? And at the level of geopolitics, does religion help or hinder world happiness? Most people would grant that the Catholic Church in Poland was instrumental in that country's overthrow of a hated and repressive government, but it is impossible to deny that Algerian Muslims are killing each other (100,000 at last count), sometimes in the name of Allah. I can only come back to the polls and the social scientific studies surveyed above. Taken as a whole these studies show, let us recall, that committed religious people on balance are more likely to avoid health-compromising behaviors, require less expensive medical care in the last year of life, and have happier marriages than their more secular peers. And the Gallup survey of deeply religious Christians showed that these "saints among us" enjoy better health, give more of their time and money to charity, and are more tolerant of people of diverse backgrounds than are the nonreligious. It seems indisputable that these activities and attitudes are good not only for individuals but for society as a whole. But are they any better than the scientific, technological, and medical breakthroughs master- minded by the world's greatest scientists and inventors, who are presumably much less religious as a group than Gallup's saints? This question does not admit of any easy answer. Personally I believe that people today are no better</page><page sequence="13">GOING BEYOND JAMES 8 1 morally than they were fifty years ago, so I am tempted to regard these admit- tedly impressive material advances as morally neutral: they give us comfort, convenience, and a longer life, but they do not necessarily promote what John Hick calls, in his lapidary phrase, "soul-making."27 Let us set aside these challenges, let us quiet for the moment the skeptic inside us and discover what tasks might lie ahead of us when we acknowledge the Pragmatic Argument's strength and give it more scope. It we grant that what works is generally based on reality (and is therefore true), and that what works better is generally more true than what works less well, then we are in a position to say what is more likely true about a religion, or a philosophy, and what is more likely false. Most obviously we can say the following: Since a generic view of the Divine produces much more happiness (or rather much less misery) in the world than one that is overly specific or too sharply defined or culturally overdetermined or excessively anthropomorphic, the broader, more mysterious, more abstract formulation is closer to the truth (or at least further removed from error) than the non-generic. But we can tiptoe into more obscure regions, for our methodology has many potential applications. If, for example, a poll showed that Catholics who believe in purgatory and therefore pray for their dead handled grief better than Methodists who believe the faithful dead are carried instantly to heaven and therefore do not pray for them, that would be an argument for the reality of an after-death state well short of eternal fulfillment for the newly dead (the Catholic's position) -just as an opposite finding would be an argument for the Methodist's. Or if, for example, it could be shown that Christians who claim that faith alone is neces- sary for salvation enjoyed consistently higher, or lower, life satisfaction than Christians who claim that faith and works are equally necessary for salvation, then that would be a pragmatic argument for the truth of one or the other claim. Using this approach, one could construct an argument for or against any number of cherished religious convictions - from scriptural literalism to the existence of angels to impersonal Buddhist notions of ultimate reality to eternal damnation for the faithless to the divinity of Christ. One could also use the pragmatic method to argue for or against a philosophical claim, such as the claim that human beings have free will: If it could be shown that believers in free will were happier and more successful than determinists, then free will would very likely be a reality. The same methodology could be used to bolster an argument for or against mind-brain identity. Of course, such a methodology, especially if it tried to bridge different cultures, would be exceedingly difficult to control for all variables.</page><page sequence="14">82 L. STAFFORD BETTY Conclusion In February 1990 Vaclav Havel, first democratically elected president of free Czechoslovakia, and today the president of the Czech Republic, addressed a joint session of the U. S. Congress; and a tiny part of that long speech has been quoted many times since. "We are still incapable of understanding," he lamented, "that the only genuine backbone of all our actions, if they are to be moral, is responsibility ... to something higher than my family, my country, my company, my success - responsibility to the order of being where all our actions are indelibly recorded and where and only where they will be properly judged."28 Two hundred years earlier George Washington said in his farewell address, "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports . . . great pillars of human happiness . . . firmest props of the duties of men and citizens."29 Would it not be a little strange if this indispensable support, this backbone of all our actions, were a chimera? Is so much good likely to come from a chimera? We saw above where the Pragmatic Argument is vulnerable to criticism, but do those considerations swamp the argument? I do not think so. Religion gives people a sense of purpose, something to fear if they shirk their duty, and something to look forward to if they perform it. Religion gives people the sense that they are never alone, even when the whole world seems to turn against them. "I had my share of the bitterest public and private experiences," wrote Gandhi. "They threw me into temporary despair. If I was able to get rid of that despair it was because of prayer."30 Gandhi speaks for billions of the faithful who turn to God when everything "has gone to pieces in the wreck," as James put it.31 Far from being a chimera, I think it more rational to conclude that something with this kind of power for good is founded on a reality. The Pragmatic Argument makes explicit why this conclusion is logically sound and intellectually compelling. Notes 1. See the lectures titled "Mysticism," in The Varieties of Religious Experience (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1961), p. 332. 2. In several of his late writings James makes it clear he never intended that truth be under- stood in a purely psychological sense. Three years before he died he expressed regret for using "unguarded language" that gave the impression religious truth consisted in the quality a religious claim has when it makes the believer "feel good." Stung by his critics, he made a clarification. Truth, he said, "is a property of certain ideas. It means their agreement, as falsity means their disagreement, with reality." (See his "Pragmatism and Radical Empiricism," in The Writings of William James, ed. John J. McDermott [Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1977], pp. 311-312.) No definition of truth could be more straightforward, or conventional, than that. Nevertheless, the way most students of</page><page sequence="15">GOING BEYOND JAMES 83 James interpret him has been inescapably affected - many would say tarnished - by the ambiguity of his earlier, less guarded writing. 3.
