MARK LEHRER 501 A consideration of Fontane's social novels within the context of late nineteenth-century scientific thought helps illuminate the underestimated originality of Fontane's realism. The notion of human self-determination, having become increasingly problematic in the course of the century, was widely regarded as untenable by the time Fontane began writing fiction. Significantly, however, the way in which the critic and artist Fontane confronts the phenomenon which we call the "psychology of exposure" reflects ultimately less a reaction against science itself than an actual affinity to certain currents of scientific thought which, in Fontane's day, were preparing to challenge the dominance of positivistic methods. "Destiny" and Hesse's Demian .......... ROBERT P. NEWTON 519 In Demian the search for the self becomes the search for one's Schicksal. Though Sinclair seeks it in the chillness of social isolation, his destiny appears as a very public war. Here as elsewhere, Hesse is of two minds about free will and about the source of destiny, whether in the self or the historical milieu. In the usage of language, Schicksal is an anthropomorphic antagonist or partner of the self, the response of the world to man's hope and action. Hesse's identification of self and destiny fails logically and in practice by insisting that destiny be sought in isolation from the world. Competing Economies in Eichendorff'sAus dem Leben eines Taugenichts .................. ARND BOHM 540 Like many of his contemporaries, Eichendorff was concerned with economic issues, both in his life and in his writings. Using the distinction between extraction and provi- dential economies, one may trace those issues in Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts. Taugenichts progresses from a naive faith in the providential economy to participation in the onmipresent modern extraction system. The reception of the novella may be seen then as an affirmation of German bourgeois values. From Edelmann to Eidgenosse: The Nobles in Wilhelm Tell .............. ROBERT L. JAMISON 554 During the final phase of his work on Wilhelm Tell, Schiller expanded and upgraded the role of the nobles and respositioned the scenes in which they are the principal figures. This restructuring not only creates a formal symmetry within the play, but also suggests that Schiller intended the nobles and their story to embody the very idea of the drama.</page><page sequence="5">The young nobleman Rudenz embodies the conflict between the res publica and the res privata and demonstrates that the common good is inextricably bound to personal aspirations grounded in natural compassion and the respect for human dignity. In accept- ing this principle, Rudenz undergoes a metamorphosis from noble to confederate--a process indicative of the reconstitution of the Swiss community. Report Themes and Motifs in Literature ..... HORST S. DAEMMRICH 566 The article examines primary trends in motif and theme research. It evaluates theoretical studies as well as contributions that have substantially clarified the concepts, and it surveys reference works that provide access to the field. In addition, the article (1) outlines the characteristic features of motifs and themes and (2) focuses on the principles that govern their literary function by making specific reference to textual organization, semblance, positional alignment, polar dimension, tension, and schemati- zation. The study concludes with a checklist of 85 works cited. DOCUMENTATION: UWE JOHNSON .................. 576 Todesgedanken? Gesprach mit Heinz D.

Articles on any aspect of German literature or language may be submitted, including those that focus on literary theory, film or feminist criticism, lin- guistics, and interdisciplinary studies, but excluding pedagogy, which is the domain of Die Unterrichtspraxis. Articles are judged on: adequacy of research, appropriateness of critical method, expository style, structure of argument, scholarly contribution in terms of subject and/or methodology, and appropri- ateness for The German Quarterly. Topics of general interest to the reader- ship are preferred, but analyses of lesser-known works are acceptable if they demonstrate innovative methodology that can be applied to other works. Manuscripts are evaluated anonymously by one to three readers, unless the Editor considers the submission clearly unsuitable for The German Quarterly, in which case it is returned to the author with an explanation. All readers are established specialists in their fields. Final decisions on the acceptability of submissions for publication are made by the Editor. Members of the Editorial Board serve individually as readers upon the Editor's request. They are consulted as a group on matters of general editorial policy. Editorial Board members may submit articles for publication, but the Editor and the Associate Editor may not. Occasionally we will commission articles, review essays, and interviews considered to be of particular interest to the readership. Announcements of professional activities should be sent to the Editor. While the Editors obviously cannot guarantee that all published articles and reviews will be free of plagiarism, every allegation of plagiarism will be pursued and, if warranted, the findings will be announced in this journal. Manuscripts may be written in English or German. They should conform to the MLA Style Manual. (See also the note on documentation on p. 499). 497</page><page sequence="8">498 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 Manuscripts should be prepared to be read anonymously; direct references to authors should be altered to the third person. A cover sheet is unnecessary if the author's name and address are included in a cover letter. We request two copies of each manuscript, a self-addressed envelope, and return post- age. While we prefer manuscripts no longer than twenty-five pages (excluding footnotes), longer articles will occasionally be published. Abstracts (c. 100 words) will be solicited from authors after their submissions have been accepted for publication. Since we use umlauts, the "8, " and raised footnote numbers, we would be grateful if "computerized authors" would either cajole their systems to comply or else insert the symbols by hand. Other information: - Manuscripts submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere will not be considered. -Average time for evaluation: 1-3 months. -Average time for publication after final acceptance: 4-8 months. - Acceptance rate: about 15%. - Average number of articles published per year: 20-24. - Circulation: approximately 8,000 copies. - Offprints are available at cost to authors. - Complimentary copies of The German Quarterly to authors of articles: two. Book reviews: In view of the ambition of the Book Review Editor to be as comprehensive as possible and yet deal with the masses of material clamoring for attention, certain arbitrary decisions had to be made. Topical headings indicate the wide variety of works in secondary literature, theory, linguistics, philology, and related cultural areas that may be included. Primary literature is not reviewed; here, arbitrary decisions are required. We will review new transla- tions and collected works of primary literature, but not new works or new editions (i.e., Reclam editions) of older primary works. Although we try to be flexible in technical matters, our normal requirements are a length of about 700 words and submission within six months of receipt of the book. Authors who want to ensure that their books are reviewed should ask their publishers to send us a review copy. - Average number of book reviews published per year: 175. --Complimentary copies of The German Quarterly to authors of review essays: two. - Complimentary copies of The German Quarterly to authors of book re- views: one.</page><page sequence="9">NOTE ON DOCUMENTATION This issue contains articles employing both the old (MLA Handbook, first edition) and the new (MLA Handbook, second edition [1984]/MLA Style Manual [1985]) forms of documentation codified by the Modern Language Association. Until now, we have specified the first edition of the Handbook as the standard for The German Quarterly; our Fall 1984 issue stated: "We will consider the possibility of shifting to the MLA's new style of documen- tation only after revised style manuals have been available for some time." We hesitated to switch to the Handbook's second edition because in its own words it focused "more sharply on its primary audience: the undergraduate student, " and because it announced "the simultaneous publication of a com- panion volume, The MLA Style Manual, a comprehensive style guide for scholars and graduate students" ("Preface for the Instructor, " p. 1). Clearly the latter would serve the needs of contributors to The German Quarterly more than the former. However, the publication of the Style Manual has been rather less than "simultaneous"; at the time of this writing, it has been announced for July 1985. We're aware of the inconvenience (if that's not too mild a word) experienced by authors who are obliged to prepare a manuscript one way for Journal "A" and another way for Journal "B." On the other hand, the resources of our Editorial Office are far too limited to undertake the conversion of old-style footnotes to the new footnotes/works-cited format. To require authors to convert their documentation themselves would, we believe, be unfair to our numerous contributors from foreign countries, who will not have ready access to the new manual for some time at least. Therefore, while we will now adopt the new Style Manual for documen- tation in The German Quarterly, we will continue to publish articles that employ the old format. This policy- admittedly deficient in consistency and aesthetics-is at least practical. We expect that the process of evolution will eventually create a consensus about documentation, and The German Quarterly will lose its appearance of Blochian Ungleichzeitigkeit. 499</page><page sequence="10">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Once again we wish to thank the members of the Editorial Board and the following colleagues who have provided evaluations of manuscripts submitted to The German Quarterly between July 1, 1984 and June 30, 1985: Leslie A.
