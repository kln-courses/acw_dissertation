<plain_text><page sequence="1">The emergence of 'maps' in European rock art: A prehistoric preoccupation with place' By CATHERINE DELANO SMITH Introduction: General aspects of rock art in Europe It is clear that the search for maps in prehistoric Europe is bound up with the much larger subject of rock art. There is no shortage of graphics from the prehistoric period amongst which to seek the earliest spatial representations. Paintings and petroglyphs are found on non- perishable materials such as rock surfaces (in the open air or in caves and rock shelters); on standing stones and in prehistoric burial chambers; on slabs and slates; and on pottery and bone artefacts. Their general distribution is widespread but there are several outstanding concentrations, notably in Cantabrian Spain and south-western and Pyrenean France (Palaeolithic), the Ligurian and Italian Alps, and Scandinavia (Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age). For these later periods over 130,000 petroglyphs are now known in a 75 kilometre stretch of Valcamonica (Brescia)2; over 100,000 examples most of which are in an area of less than 12 square kilometres at the foot of Monte Bego (Tende)3; and between 2,000 and 3,000 engravings or paintings on 70 rock surfaces in Norway.4 In northern Sweden, at Namforsen, there are another 2,0005 while further south the province of Bohuslkn is an exceptionally richly decorated part of Gotland.6 The majority of Palaeolithic paintings, bas -reliefs, and incisions come from the caves and rock shelters of western Europe.7 Notwithstanding the breadth of their geographical extent and the length of the timespan (c.30,000 to 9,000 B.C. for the main part of the Upper Palaeolithic and 7,000 to c.500 B.C. for the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages) and the technical and stylistic variety of the figures, a striking aspect of both Palaeolithic and post-Palaeolithic rock art is an 'extraordinary unity of artistic content'8 and it is with this content that we are primarily concerned. Although 'doodles'-the scratchings of idlers-have been recognized in prehistoric contexts9, most cave paintings and rock engravings have to be accepted as seriously intended. Those that are of recognizable subjects are often superbly and skilfully portrayed, whether in naturalistic or highly stylised form. Moreover, both techniques of painting and incision demand careful preparation (e.g. of the pigment) and patient persistence in execution (e.g. in the hammering or chiselling of usually the hardest rocks of the region). There are however innumerable markings the subject of which cannot be recognized with certainty, or even guessed at, although their manner of execution was no less deliberate. These include the geometric forms and an intriguing range of miscellaneous figures which must have been intended as signs or symbols, conveying a meaning that is not readily discernible today in the absence of written explanation or indigenous ethnographic parallel'0 or direct tradition. The naturalistic pictures, too, may have been intended as symbolic, that is to say, having a double meaning, but if this were the case the second level of meaning remains uncertain. It is, how- ever, the first category-that of the geometric and miscellaneous markings-that contains the figures of potential interest to historians of cartography. Problems in the study ofprehistoric maps in Europe The diversity of maps in the post-medieval period-traditionally the main focus of interest in the history of cartography-offers an approach to the study of maps from the prehistoric period. Above all, it reveals the breadth of human interest in all forms of space-not only terrestrial but also celestial and cosmological-as well as the cartographers' rich inventiveness 9</page><page sequence="2">in the creation and presentation of maps. But the study of historic maps also reveals a number of limitations and caveats that need to be borne in mind before embarking on a search for prehistoric maps and before modern hindsight can be used to illuminate them. These concern, first, the criteria by which a map is recognized and, second, the fact that a map may have several categories of meaning. The first point has received little attention, presumably because for most historians of cartography the problem simply does not arise. Even Robinson and Petchenik, in their discussion of the nature of maps", do not give a simple check-list of the characteristics by which a key-less, title-less and scale-less map might be recognized. Faced, however, with the vast array of prehistoric man's graphic art, some criteria are needed as a starting point and an attempt will be made below to provide them. The second point that has to be borne in mind is that while maps may be taken at face value as a record of the spatial location of selected features they can also be analysed for hidden or even unconsciously given messages.'2 Each map, therefore, needs to be understood at all its levels, in terms of both surface and deeper meanings. If all this is true for maps from the historic period, it is pari passu applicable to the prehistoric period, yet the meaning as opposed to the content of a figure from the prehistoric period may be very hard to discover. There are, however, even more basic problems in the study of prehistoric maps in Europe and these are introduced first. (i) The shortage of secondary literature. There is a notable absence of discussion both on the origins of the map concept in the history of cartography literature and on the existence of maps in the prehistoric period in the orthodox archaeological literature. In the first case, the weight of research has been largely confined to the latter part of the historic period'3 notwith- standing the fact that, as part of the history of the development of means of human communi- cation, maps and the development of map-making may date back (in Europe) some thirty thousand years to the earliest surviving cave art. In the second context, the search for maps has often been assigned to the lunatic fringe of archaeological investigation. Star maps have been recognized in the pattern of cup-marks, small hollows scooped out of natural rocks or standing stones,'4 or combinations of natural fissures and incised lines on cliffs and boulders have been seen as maps of neolithic trade routes or of regional topography.'5 When enthusiasm has outweighed realism such a fate is undoubtedly appropriate. Nonetheless, the literature is worth sifting. (ii) The absence of an established corpus of prehistoric maps. Not even all the few known examples have been reported in the history of cartography literature. The main exception is undoubtedly the rock carving from Bedolina at Capo di Ponte in Valcamonica, dated to the middle of the second millennium B.C.16 On the other hand, a second petroglyphic map, first announced in print in 1934, has been ignored by the cartographic world despite its physical and conceptual propinquity to the Bedolina map, possibly because there is no adequate repro- duction of it and because the word 'map' was not initially associated with it.'7 Since then, the number of possible cartographic figures from Valcamonica has grown'8 but even so Paul Harvey refers in his history of topographical maps to only one of these, a simple map from Seradina'9, while those from Monte Bego remain uncited. More recently, however, attention has been drawn to the wall painting excavated from the neolithic site of natal Hilytik (Konya, Turkey) in 1963 and since dated to the seventh millennium B.c.20 Advance on the cosmo- logical map front has been even slower. In 1937 Eckard Unger published his idea that the repousse decoration of a newly discovered gold disc from Moordorf (Aurich, Germany) constitutes a cosmological map2', an interpretation George Kish is evidently still happy with.22 (iii) The difficulty of positively identifying an intended cartographic representation from the wealth of figures in European prehistoric rock art. There are problems of discerning order in the rock art, yet order is important in all forms of communication.23 Many surfaces are quite obviously palimpsests, aggregates of non-contemporary drawings with some figures literally super- imposed upon earlier ones, but unless there are stylistic or technical contrasts it is difficult to tell, in the case of scattered groups of figures, which are earlier or later or which may be contemporary. It is also difficult to see which groups were intended as compositions; many 10</page><page sequence="3">researchers, reporting on their region's rock art, say that compositions are rarely, if ever, evident. There is, too, the problem of the meaning of the figures. In general, the simplest kind of communication system provides a single message from the association of a single meaning with a single sign24 but ethnographic experience shows that such a straightforward association should not be assumed in rock art (see below). Similarly, experience of maps from the historic period shows that a variety of form and style, quite apart from content, may be anticipated. But it is by taking a topographical map from this period-and removing the title, scale and key so as to mask its context-that criteria may be devised for the identification of similarly anonymous maps in prehistoric rock art. First, and perhaps the most obvious, is that we need to be convinced that the figure was intended as a composition. There would be, ideally, unequivocal evidence that all the component markings were contemporary; for example, lines would neatly connect and be neither superimposed nor isolated. Less satisfactorily, the markings could be contained within a frame. This frame could be either positive (a set of enclosing lines) or negative (an empty margin separating it from its neighbour or from the 'natural edge' of the object upon which the figure has been executed). The second criterion would be that the components of the figure would not be obviously non-topographical: animal and anthropomorphic figures and drawings of weapons, for example, would be excluded. Despite the difficulty of establishing meaning, the components of the composition would be from the classes of 'geometric' or 'abstract markings' in the content analyses of rock art25 even if they were not immediately recognizable as topographic signs. Third, the composition would be composed of a variety of these elements-two or three types of rectangular figures, lines and circles, for instance. Fourth, in a major composition, most of these elements would recur frequently, since we are considering the case of a topographical map as opposed to a thematic map (such as a star map for which the criteria are different).26 To these four criteria-evidence of cohesion, the appropriateness of subject matter or component signs, the heterogeneity of these signs, and the fact that at least some are repeated-can be added the observation that irregularity is more often a characteristic of topographic maps than geometric symmetry or mathematical regularity.27 With these criteria as guidelines, it may be anticipated that prehistoric maps composed of images (naturalistic representations) or mimetic signs (signs having some visual equivalence28) may be fairly easily identified. A more complex map of symbolic intent, however, is less likely to be discovered because of the problem (shared with primitive art) of the almost complete lack of clear relationship betwen the form or outline of the figure and its meaning.29 Neither of the two general categories of signs, the esoteric signs of the initiated and the exoteric signs of the general population , can be taken at face value. The meaning of the former are by definition known only to a closed circle (e.g. the priestly); the meaning of the latter is known to vary spatially and over time. For instances, ethnological experience shows that the same ideo- logical content can be expressed in different figurative signs3"; that the meaning of the signs can vary from tribe to tribe32, perhaps also between initiated and unititiated; or according to context33; and that the very form of the sign may have to be altered because of technical constraints.34 (iv) The perceptual stance of the investigator. The fourth problem concerns our appreciation of the skill and conceptual scope of the so-called primitive mind.35 At least one historian of carto- graphy has already noted how 'many of the past studies failed to appreciate the sophistication of the culture being studied'36, a limitation inherited from the widespread and deeply-rooted Darwinian belief in intellectural progression. If, on the one hand, it does not necessarily help to overstress the closeness of primitive and modern logic at the expense of making allowance for continuity in the evolution of cultural beliefs37, on the other it is certainly no longer accept- able to perceive the primitive mind as capable only of a 'primitive' -meaning naive-level of thought and of concomitantly crude modes of self-expression in art. To insist that prehistoric art is clumsy or elementary is to reveal an insensitivity to variations of art form and style. To ignore the 'historical seriality of myth'38 and the connection between these myths and the subject matter of this art (inasfar as it can be discerned) is to disregard the degree to which, in 11</page><page sequence="4">the modern, western, urbanized mind, 'feeling' has been divorced from 'thinking'39 and banished to a secondary, inconsequential, level. It is, however, the presence of various forms of 'feeling', rather than of differences in logical capacity, that distinguishes the primitive from the modern mode of thought. In this respect, with their myths and superstitutions, traditional rural European societies have manifested a closer link with the primitive and prehistoric mode of thought than with their modern successors.40 It thus becomes necessary for the historian of cartography to accept that it is a whole paradigm shift that separates him from the prehistoric map-makers and not merely a set of evolutionary stages within a familiar intellectual framework. (v) Discovering the original purpose and context of rock art. As far as the earliest maps go, historical experience is of little service. The greatest proportion of maps produced in literate societies has been for the purpose of recording, however varied the manner or object, or directing. Though by no means unknown in pre-literate societies41, these functions were much less common and likely to have been similarly alien in prehistoric times. Traditional learning, ethnology shows, is communicated orally. Just as, in the traditional rural societies of Europe, matters concerning the nature of the land and the manner of its exploitation were passed from father to son, together with the little rituals and observances that were deemed as necessary for a successful harvest as any technical practice42, so, too, a whole body of geographical knowledge has to be transmitted from generation to generation in primitive societies. Aboriginal people do not normally lose their way; they have learnt the names and locations they need in the day- to-day business of making a living.43 An extremely interesting point, however, is the manner of this learning, which is through ritual and the sacred life, and this again serves as a reminder of the fusion in the pre-modern mind of thinking and feeling. As part of the former body of its spatial knowledge, maps seem to have but little place within pre-literate societies. It may accordingly be misleading to lay emphasis-as Kish has done-on their practical roles. It is doubtful if many primitive maps-cartes instruments, as he calls them-were in fact sketches 'of the little practical world of a tribe, reproducing more or less faithfully the scene of action ... [serving] as an aide mimoire for hunters, fishers, trappers, indicating the nature of the terrain, traditional trackways, fords, water sources in the forest, desert or tundra'.44 Rather, they should be regarded as conveyances for other less 'practical' but equally necessary thoughts. Harvey, however, had already expressed a doubt over the narrowness of this strictly functional interpretation, considering it 'unlikely that the only-or even the principal-reason why primitive people drew maps was to help them find their way'.45 In view of the ethnographic evidence which underlies doubts such as Harvey's and reassess- ments such as Blakemore's, the problem for the historian of cartography might be better inverted: why should any maps at all be expected from the prehistoric period in Europe? The fact is that there are a few; the corollary therefore is 'why so few?' especially in relation to the quantity of non-topographic subjects contained in the rock art. The answer must be in the beliefs and priorities of the societies concerned. The closeness of the association of subject matter with belief in rock art is beyond dispute. So, if animals constitute the major part of the subject matter of rock art in Europe this must be because the animals, or-more importantly-whatever it was their images were used to symbolize, were a major preoccupation in one way or another. Arguably, too, their represen- tation on a rock surface is some form of fossilized prayer. In the old, functionalist, view the figures represented a 'sympathetic hunting magic' formula, designed to allay what would seem as the major anxieties of Palaeolithic hunters, namely that their game should flourish and that they themselves should continue to enjoy successful hunting.46 Doubts about the economic validity of this view were strengthened by anthropologists observing that hunting and gather- ing peoples were unconcerned to the point of fecklessness as regards their food supply.47 In the new view, weight is given to the 'mental world' of the prehistoric artists. Inasmuch as they were concerned first and foremost with delineating wild animals, rather than human figures, it has been suggested that these animal paintings and engravings indicate a reverence for them not merely as food but as gods or as carriers of divinity.48 12</page><page sequence="5">The art of prehistoric man, whether hunter or farmer, reflected the way he lived; his keen powers of observation; his constant use of symbolism; the relationship between ritual and the crafts of his daily life (e.g. techniques of hunting or, later, of ploughing); and the emphasis on the turning points of his existence (procreation, birth, but above all, death).49 If, then, images of houses and maps of villages and fields appear so rarely, it has to be concluded that these aspects of prehistoric life attracted little of the 'cosmic anguish'50 that can be said to give rise to all art and prayer. What is noteworthy, however, is that all the map examples so far known date from the later, agricultural, part of the prehistoric period (i.e. from the Neolithic onwards). It could be argued that the execution of the maps of fields and villages indicate a lack of security in the new settled way of life and a painful awareness of its vulnerability to accidents of nature, such as damage by flood or drought and crop failure, or to the careless- ness of men, such as the loss of seed grain through spoiling or of the home through fire. But even if the maps must be seen as representing some of the values of the day, other questions arise. Why should they be almost common in certain parts of Europe but rare elsewhere in Europe?5' Does this mean there is an entire vocabulary of unrecognized place-associated signs from these other parts, and from the so-far mapless Palaeolithic period? If the Bronze Age maps of Valcamonica and Monte Bego were executed in a ritualistic or sacred context, when- and why-did maps take on their main modern function, that of recording? It is premature at this stage to attempt to answer these questions. What is already clear is that the search for the origins of cartography in Europe should involve a full survey of the content and meaning of prehistoric art, despite the many problems, not only because the maps may be there but because this art is the only archive available of prehistoric thought and communication. To attempt solely to establish a series of claims for 'the oldest map' is at once too selective and too shallow an approach to do justice to the potential of the prehistoric period as the source of at least some of the cartographic concepts of our own times. The documented examples (i) Valcomonica. At the time of its reporting, the Bedolina map was claimed to be the 'oldest known plan of an inhabited site'.52 It had been dated, on stylistic grounds, to sometime between 2,000 and 1,500 B.C. (early to middle Bronze Age). As is well known, it is a complex of figures inscribed on the undulating surface of an ice-smoothed rock which tilts slightly down- slope. The rock is just one of thousands which outcrop on the steep hillsides of this part of Valcamonica and, projecting from a salient, it affords an extensive view (vegetation permit- ting) of the flat bottom of the main valley, some 40 metres below, and of its settlements, fields and the winding Oglio river. The entire rock surface is covered with a variety of figures, making it, at 4.16 metres by 2.30 metres, one of the largest assemblages in Valcamonica.53 Although, thanks to the English botanist Clarence Bicknell, the incisions from the Monte Bego area (on the Franco-Italian frontier) had been known since the end of the last century, the modern discovery of the petroglyphic wealth of Valcamonica did not gain momentum until 1930.54 Exactly who was the first to see the Bedolina rock and recognize it as a map is not clear but in 1932, at the London meeting of the First International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences, Raffaello Battaglia described two compositions as 'very accurate' representations of fields and enclosures with, in one case, 'a broad winding band, which represents the course of a river'.55 There is no doubt, from the descriptions, he was referring to the Bedolina and the Giadighe figures respectively though he named neither until his second publication in 1934.56 It was not until 1958 that another archaeologist, Emmanuel Anati, introduced Bedolina as 'The rock with the plan and the view toward the valley beyond' and went on to suggest that 'it seems clear that the engraving is a faithful representation of what the artist saw in the valley.57 Two years later he referred to it specifically as 'a true map of the region'58 and Walter Blumer followed suit soon after.59 However, there seems never to have been a critical discussion of the basis of such an identification and the only published analysis is a stylistic one.60 The history of cartography world first saw the Bedolina 'map' in Blumer's illustrations in Imago Mundi 38 ( 1964). In this version there are eight main figure-types (Figure la): 13</page><page sequence="6">* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~gw, Fig. 1 (b) The BEDOLINA PETROGLYPH, VALCAMONICA (a) 'Restitution of the elements ... in the plane of a map'-Walter Blumer's version as published in Imago Mundi XVIII (1964). Blumer's drawing is similar to, but not identical with, the first drawing (as opposed to photograph) of the Bedolina composition published by E. Anati, 'Les travaux et les jours aux ages des metaux du Val Camonica,' L'Anthropologie, 63 ( 1959) 248-268+54 plates, where it appears as Figure 2. (b) The same drawing adapted to take account of earlier and later figures to show the 'Phase B' stage as analysed by Lionis ( 1972). 14</page><page sequence="7">rectangles, points, irregular single lines, circles, ladder-like figures, house-like figures, animal- like figures, anthropomorphic figures. However, not all of these are necessarily part of the map. Lloris's stylistic analysis revealed, on technical grounds, that there were at least four separate phases of engraving, with the 'map' coming from the second (Phase B) (Figure Ib). All house-like, animal-like, anthropomorphic and miscellaneous figures (the 'celtic rose', the (?) phallic figure) either precede the main drawing (the map) or were later additions. Ignoring the ladder-like figures (of which there are only two out of a total of nearly two hundred markings on the rock), the cartographic figure is found to have been composed of no more than four figure types: rectangles, points, irregular single lines and circles. These tend also to have a specific relationship with each other: in the majority of cases each small circle contains a single point; large groups of points are not only regularly disposed but almost always neatly contained within a rectangle; and, finally, no irregular line is entirely disconnected, most touch another line, a rectangle or, occasionally, a circle-with-point. This means the drawing can be reduced to a composition of three main elements (Figure 2): 1. rectangles filled with regularly spaced points 2. small circles with a single central point 3. irregular single connecting lines. Assuming these to have some cartographic significance, the Bedolina petroglyph meets all four criteria-an obvious degree of composition, the appropriateness of the figures, their heterogeneity, and their repetition. Their distribution also appears haphazard. But what do these elements represent? It has to be decided whether they are to be interpreted strictly as images, exact likenesses of actual objects; as representational signs, mimetic figures of features in the surrounding landscape; or as true symbols, selected to convey an additional or alternative meaning. If they were intended as the former, it is hard to guess what object, or set of objects, they could picture. So far, all who have published the Bedolina complex as a map must have tacitly accepted that they are representational signs and they have done so with, presumably, an excellent precedent in mind, the interpretations of Clarence Bicknell at Monte Bego. (ii) Monte Bego. The writings of Rafaello Battaglia, in particular, but also of almost all commentators on the Valcamonica incisions, owe a good deal to Clarence Bicknell. Bicknell devoted twelve summers in all to the study of the mass of rock engravings found in the highly coloured, hard rocks around the strange peak of Monte Bego. They have featured in modern literature since the 1820s.6' Bicknell published most of his findings in 1902, 1903 and 1913 and these reports remain the standard work on the area.62 The majority of the 100,000 or so petroglyphs now known are found in two regions, Fontanalba to the north of the peak and Merveilles to the south-west. The lowest are at about 2,000 metres above sea-level, the highest about 2,750 metres. There are minor stylistic differences between the Monte Bego figures and those of Valcamonica, but both techniques and underlying concepts are essentially the same. More interestingly, there are differences not so much in the range of features shown as in their relative importance. Ploughs, plough teams, ploughing scenes and oxen alone are remark- ably common at Monte Bego, for instance. Particularly relevant for the historian of carto- graphy are a large number of small compositions made up of rectangles, outlined or solid, which are associated with larger sub-circular features, some of which contain numerous dots, large or small, or other objects. To Bicknell, the key to these figures was the realization that they were landscape features drawn in plan as seen clearly from above, high on the moun- tainside, looking down into the valley below. In this way he recognized the plough teams and the compositions as representing 'the huts which the people inhabited and. . . the enclosures around them', some of which contained oxen or plough teams, and grazing cattle or sheep, and the paths linking them63 (Fig. 3). While the bird's-eye views of the oxen could be called images, it is probably more accurate to consider the rectangles as schematic representations of the hut roofs as seen from above and the large sub-circular features as indicating rather than portraying the neighbouring pastures. It was with these figures at Monte Bego in mind, there- 15</page><page sequence="8">MAIN FIGURE TYPES "MAP" ELEMENTS [7 RECTANGLES m m RECTANGLES WITH POINTS REGULAR POINTS U CRCE CIRCLES WITH SINGLE POINTS IRREGULAR SINGLE LINES 9 CONNECTING LINES L X LADDERS Fig. 2 TYPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BEDOLINA MAP (phase B) showing the main cartographical elements of which it appears to be composed. fore, that the neat rectangles of the Bedolina composition were interpreted as signifying the small, arable plots of the valley bottom; the regularly spaced points within them as the trees or crops therein; and the irregular lines as the paths and streams that are still characteristic of the region.64 On the other hand, while such interpretations may make the cartographic content clear, its meaning is another matter. Was the artist (or map-maker) really drawing the view that lay below (and behind) him onto the Bedolina rock? Or was he using these representations of fields and crops to convey a more abstract meaning-agricultural fertility or the security of the homestead, for example? An important difference between the Bedolina map on the one hand and probably every other topographic figure (whether from Valcamonica or Monte Bego) on the other, may provide a clue. It is the difference in size and complexity of the compositions. The Bedolina map includes about 30 arable fields but few of the 40 or so figures from the Fontanalba valley below Monte Bego comprise more than one or two 'huts' and two or three adjacent 'fields'. Given the environmental contrast between the two districts, valley bottom on the one hand and high mountain on the other, it is reasonable to see the differences of form between the Valcamonica and Monte Bego topographic figures as reflecting differences in the actual landscape of the day. As in the recent historic period65, prehistoric land use in the upper valleys of the Maritime Alps was likely to have contained a substantial livestock element while settlement would have been of the hamlet type, scattered homesteads and small groups. In the more hospitable and accessible valley bottom environment of Valcamonica, arable land use appears to have been associated with a settlement pattern which included at least one major nucleation. If this is the case, the complexities and intricacies of the Bedolina composition may well have been intended as a more or less true record of the disposition of a Bronze age village at which is now Capo di Ponte, with its associated closes. The simpler figures from Monte Bego (and from elsewhere in Valcamonica)66 should be seen as either accurate or symbolic represen- tations of specific places, the simplicity of their form reflecting the realities of the local landscape. (iii) Catal Huyzik. The wall-painting from natal Hiuyiik has now supplanted the Bedolina incision as 'the oldest known', having been dated archaeologically to 6,200+97 B.C.67 But its interest for historians of cartography lies less in this claim than the nature of its context. The wall painting (Fig. 4) is about the same length as the Bedolina map (about 4 metres). The chief colours are red/reddish-brown. It is composed of 80 or so closely spaced rectangular blocks with circles in some of the angles. The resemblance between this part of the wall-painting and the excavators' own plan of the buildings they had uncovered is so striking that Mellaart had no difficulty in interpreting it as showing 'a town rising in graded terraces closely packed with 16</page><page sequence="9">C) 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C NO VA' ~~~~~~~~~J- ho bO~~* - I~ -~0 Cl bX) - t.- S C 0 w ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ oS 0 C (&lt;. *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ / ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~(- -0i C-'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~l -0 Qd c'Sd /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4.

That this mountain was intended to be the erupting Hasan Dag, whose now dormant cone is clearly visible from the site of (atal Htiytik, is highly reasonable, particularly since dormancy is recent and volcanic activity could have been expected up to about 2000 B.C.69 The site of (atal Huyiik has become renowned for the quantity and quality of the wall-paintings. As at Valcamonica, therefore, the topo- graphical subject matter at natal Htiytik is distinctly in the minority; the other paintings are anthropomorphic or of animals, birds (especially vultures), or figures that probably represent flowers or plants. All wall decorations at (atal Huyiik come from what the archaeological evidence demonstrates beyond doubt are shrines or rooms set aside for religious and not domestic or industrial purposes: 'Of the 139 living rooms excavated to date at (atal Hiiyiik not less than 40 appeared to have served the Neolithic relgion'.70 Of particular interest is the fact that it is clear that each painting was not executed with the intention of lasting; the walls were regularly replastered and, sometimes, painted. This practice is paralleled earlier in prehistory, in the Magdelanian (Upper Palaeolithic) for example, when engraved slate plaques were deliberately broken before disposal.7" The clear inference is that the import of this art lay in the act of execution itself, or in the moment of ritual, and that it was never intended to last. Any maps executed in this manner would have had an extremely high mortality and their survival, therefore is merely incidental. Ethnographical experience supports this, showing that much of modern primitive art is the result of trance, hallucinatory or dream conditions.72 It shows too that the place of execution is always a designated one, though sometimes separate for the intiated and the uninitiated73, a conclusion that Leroi Le Gourhan and others have accepted for the Palaeolithic 'cave sanctuaries' of Iberian and southeastern France74, and that Bicknell suggested for the 'Holy Place' of Monte Bego.75 The value of the (atal Hiiytik map, therefore, lies in the fact that it is an integral part of a body of art whose religious context is archaeologically attested and not merely surmised. Conclusion: Beyond the documented examples According to the new anthropological view, rock art is now seen as part of an ordered and sophisticated view of the sacred aspects of daily life. If villages and fields were depicted in it, they would have been associated less with the 'objective' recording of a spatial distribution for purposes of direction or reference than with invoking the favours of the controlling forces of those aspects of life these topographical features were used to represent or with attempts to appease them. In the manner of the ex-votos of classical and historical times, they may also have been intended to show appreciation for favours already enjoyed. The cartographical scope of 18</page><page sequence="11">European rock art appears, however, to be by no means restricted to this topographical content. It has been asserted that some rock carvings are star maps and represent individual constellations. The physician Baudoin saw the Great Bear outlined in cup-marks on the menhir of Pierre St Martin Avon (Mayenne) and on other stones and rocks.76 Another student of rock art has identified carvings from Bohuslin (Sweden) as containing 'an obvious represen- tation of Charles' Wain and the Milky Way in fairly correct juxtaposition'.77 The same author went on to reproduce, amongst others, the markings on the Dalby stone in Denmark as a map of the eight constellations visible from there about the 20 May (Fig. 5). The historiography of prehistoric rock markings is not lacking in interpretations where fancy has overruled academic reason but this aspect of the literature should not be allowed to mask the reasonableness of the basic hypotheses. After all, for a farming population, the seasons do have a special importance: 'the collective rites of the community take on a new pattern and are associated with ploughing, seed time and harvest, the key points of the farmer's year'.78 Farmers had to associate the position of certain constellations in the sky with the time for a particular agricultural task.79 So Hesiod (8th century B.C.) advised 'At the time when the Pleiades, the daughters of Atlas, are rising, begin your harvests, and plough again when they are setting. . .'.80 Seven centuries later, Cato said that the trimming of the olive-yard 'should begin fifteen days after the vernal equinox'81 and Varro gave not only a detailed breakdown of the agricultural calendar according to the zodiac but also gives specific advice, such as mating cattle not before 'the rising of the constellation which the Greeks call Lyra, and which our people call Fides'.82 Archaeological evidence also shows that interest in death and the after-life was both very strong and widespread by the Neolithic period. Quite apart from the architectural details of burials and cremation there is the proliferation, in tombs and in rock art in general, of the death-associated symbol, the labyrinth, and of designs assuredly derived from it or allied to it." The labyrinth (or maze) sign has been commonplace in European art from the Balkans to Iberia and to Scandinavia from Neolithic times at least to the Middle Ages. Modern ethno- graphic parallels reveal that the labyrinth may have been more, however, than just a sign for the afterlife and that it could have been conceived of as a map, embodying The Path (of the dead) to the other world.84 In similar vein, some painted rock compositions have been interpreted as showing the earth and the sky, such as the cave of Magourata, Bulgaria.85 Prehistoric stele decorations have been similarly seen as cosmological representations. One from Ossimo (Valcamonica) is said to show the earth, the sky and 'the subterranean world or the world of the dead'8i6 and another, from Triora (Liguria) 'heaven, the earthly world, and the world of the dead (Fig. 6).87 These depictions may be a far cry from the maps of Bedolina and (atal Hiiyuk and are liable to a greater degree of subjectivity in interpretation but even so there may be a case for accepting them as possible maps of the cosmos. A final observation is that all these cartographic, or possible cartographic, figures-whether topographical, celestial or cosmological-have come from the Neolithic period or from the Bronze and Iron Ages. Very little can be said about the Palaeolithic contribution to the corpus of prehistoric maps. It is not that there is any shortage of geometrical or miscellaneous figures amongst the often remarkable animal and anthropomorphic forms in Palaeolithic art but the problem is that these do not appear to comprise even rudimentary compositions. On the contrary, scholars are agreed that one of the striking characteristics of Palaeolithic art is the 'self-sufficiency of each drawing'.88 Two possible inferences may be made from this contrast between Palaeolithic and post-Palaeolithic art. It may be that prehistoric man's sense of place and awareness of landscape did not develop until the coming of agriculture in the Neolithic, when his inherent cosmic insecurity was merely transferred from the uncertainties of a hunting economy to the not necessarily more assured one of farming. Or it may be that the earlier rock art does contain place representations but in forms which are impossible to identify, let alone translate. One point is clear, however; the basic elements of t c r v of the crtograpi vocabular f the historic period-the images and the representational signs-appear to have been formulated by the time the topographical figures were being hammered out of the ice-smoothed rocks of Valcamonica and on the heights of Monte Bego in the late Neolithic and the Bronze Age and 19</page><page sequence="12">Auriga Charless Wain{ Twins Bootesj Cancer * Hound : - ,1 ~Lion / Virgo/ I~~~~~~~~~~~ lg5CMROTEABSNarlacntlisaeStt12woddhpk I Fig. 5.

It is hoped, therefore, that room may be found in the early chapters of future histories of cartography for discussion not only of the recognizable maps from the prehistoric period but also of possible signs signifying place and place-based concepts. 21</page><page sequence="14">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author is greatly indebted to Brian Harley, Paul Harvey, Malcolm Lewis and David Woodward for their valued criticisms and discussions and help with references.

Full-scale discovery and accurate recording is in itself a major task and it is perhaps not surprising that, so far, few systematic content analyses-as opposed to classified descriptions-have been attempted. By 'geometric' are usually meant recognizable forms (circles, ovals, grid-pattern figures, etc.). The content of the 'abstract' group may overlap with these but mostly comprises markings that are consistent in their context but difficult to describe or classify (various forms of crosses, hoop or U-motifs, arrangements of parallel lines or of dots, wavey lines, for example; and those figures called by Breuil and Leroi Gourhan 'key-like' (claviform), 'shield-like' (scutiform) and 'house-like' (tectiform) summarized in Marshack, Alexander, The roots of civilisation, the cognitive beginnings of man'sfirst art, symbol and notation (London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972)). E. Anati has a chart of figure types for use by recording teams working on the petroglyphs in Valcamonica (Anati, E., Methods of recording and analysing rock engravings (Capo di Ponte, Edizione del Centro, 197 7). Nearly 100 typological figures are divided into five main groups: human, animal; buildings, vehicles and heavy implements; weapons not held by human figures; symbolic, schematic and abstract figures. The last class contains just over 40 types including two specified as 'topographical' (simple and complex). 26. And in many ways less arbitrary, since individual figures on the petroglyph must correlate with distinct astronomical entities and the relationship amongst these figures must be shown to correspond to the relationship among astronomical entities: Mayer, D., 'Miller's hypothesis in some Californian and Nevada evidence', Archaeostronomy (Journal of the History of Astronomy) 1 (1979) 52. 27. There are exceptions, notably planned towns and villages and areas of land reform (e.g. Roman centuriation) or reclamation. Imagine the difficulty of interpreting a key-less, title-less, scale-less and out-of-context map of the Renaissance fortification settlement of Palmanova (Udine). The author's attention has been drawn to Barbara Petchenik's comment: 'Through familiarity, one forgets how abstract are the marks on a map, and thereby also forgets to consider how little meaning they may have for observers less familiar with the conveyance of meaning in cartography'.

Farmers cross themselves before they start sowing, their wives having already had a handful of the seed blessed in church (Angarano, Francesco, Vita traditionale dei contadini e pastori Calabresi (Leo Olschki, Florence, 1973) 181). In Scotland, charm stones were in great use in a variety of agricultural contexts. In Orkney, for instance, a piece of red or brown coloured stone, sometimes specially holed, was hung on the beam of a plough, always on the side facing the sun (information from Edwina Proudfoot, F.S.A.). 43.
