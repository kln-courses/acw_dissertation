<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OCCURRENCE AND WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF A "GHOST CULT" ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER SUGGESTED BY CARVINGS IN WOOD, BONE AND STONE By WM. DUNCAN STRONG SPEAKING of a Chinookan Indian village of eight houses on the lower Columbia River between The Dalles and the mouth of the Klickitat River in what is now the State of Washington, Lewis and Clark (in 1805) mention a plank house where "There were figures of men, birds, and different animals, which were cut and painted on the boards which form the sides of the room; though the workmanship of these uncouth figures was very rough, they were as highly esteemed by the Indians as the finest frescoes of more civilized peo- ple."I Here they also briefly describe the large and graceful dugout canoes of the lower Columbia having raised bow and, occasionally, stern posts decorated with carved men, bears, and other animals, the large plank houses, and the neat wooden and grass utensils used for stone boiling. Also of special interest are the sacred medicine bags which were suspended in the houses of important men. One of these contained the forefingers of fourteen enemy "Snake" In- dians, whose raids prior to this time seem to have largely discouraged Chi- nookan settlement on the south, or Oregon shore, at and above this section of the river. This same Chinookan chief had several articles of white trade goods, and "on one side of the room were two wide split boards placed together, so as to make space for a rude figure of a man cut and painted on them. On pointing to this and asking him what it meant, he said something, of which all we under- stood was "good," and then stepped to the image and brought out his bow and quiver, which, with some other warlike instruments, were kept behind it." A few days later, just below the Cascades of the Columbia, Captain Clark notes: About half a mile below this house, in a very thick part of the woods, is an ancient burial place. It consists of eight vaults made of pine or cedar boards closely connected, about eight feet square and six in height; the top covered with wide boards sloping a little, so as to convey off the rain. The direction of all of these vaults is east and west, the door being on the eastern side, partially stopped with wide boards decorated with rude pictures of men and other animals. On entering we found in some of them four dead bodies, carefully wrapped in skins, tied with cords of grass and bark, lying on a mat, in a direction east and west. The other vaults contained only bones, which were in some of them piled to the height of four feet. On the tops of the vaults, and on poles attached to them, hung brass kettles and frying-pans with holes in their bottoms, baskets, bowls, sea-shells, skins, pieces of cloth, hair, bags of trinkets and small bones -the offerings of friendship or affection, which have been saved by a pious veneration from the ferocity of war, or the more dangerous temptations of individual gain.

(See bibliography at end of article.) 244</page><page sequence="2">STRONG] "GHOST CULT" ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 245 whole of the walls, as well as the door, were decorated with strange figures cut and painted on them; and besides these were several wooden images of men,.some so old and decayed as to have almost lost their shape, which were all placed against the sides of the vaults. These images, as well as those in the houses we have lately seen, do not appear to be at all the objects of adoration; in this place they were most probably in- tended as resemblances of those whose decease they indicate; when we observe them in houses, they occupy the most conspicuous part, but are treated more like ornaments than objects of worship. Near the vaults which are standing are the remains of others on the ground completely rotted and covered with moss; and as they are formed of the most durable pine and cedar timber, there is every appearance that for a very long series of years this retired spot has been the depository for the Indians near this place. In 1814, Alexander Henry2 describes similar carvings at a Chinookan vil- lage on the south shore below the Cascades. These houses'are sunk about three feet under ground; the entrance is at one end by a narrow oval door, with a knotty log on the inside for a ladder. Next the door and facing it is a plank partition, behind which is the fireplace, about 10 feet square, sunk two feet below the ground floor of the house. At the other end is another partition of planks, be- hind which a range of beds, raised three feet from the ground, occupies the furthermost end of the house and runs round on both sides to opposite the partition near the door. The front planks of the beds are carved and painted in various styles. At the end of each range are some broad upright planks, on which figures are rudely carved, somewhat re- sembling fluted pillars. At the foot of the chief's bed are planted in the ground at equal distances four figures 'of human heads, about two feet high, adorned with a kind of crown, and rudely carved and painted. Beside these figures are erected in the ground two large, flat, painted stones. On the side of each partition, facing the fireplace, are carved and painted on the planks uncouth figures of eagles, tortoises, and other ani- mals, some of them four feet long. The colors used are white, red, black, and green; the sculpture, in some instances, is not bad. Unfortunately, such interesting products of the woodcarver's art on the lower Columbia have almost entirely disappeared. Even the most durable woods, among which the local cedar holds a high place, cannot normally long survive the humid conditions that prevail in the Columbia region west of the Cascade Mountains. However, a fortunate accident has preserved to the pres- ent at least two of the anthropomorphic images of the type described by the early explorers (pl. 1). These specimens were discovered in 1904 by the late Henry J. Biddle while surveying a trail around the very inaccessible eastern, or river, front of Beacon Rock (sometimes called Castle Rock) on the Wash- ington shore of the Columbia some little distance below the Cascades. The two carved wooden' effigies had been inserted in a talus slope close under an over- hanging crag and were thus largely sheltered from the elements. The bottoms Coues, 1897, Vol. II.

Being made of cedar the effigies may well have a considerable antiquity. It seems possible that they had remained undisturbed since the time they were placed in the hidden rock shelter by the natives. Thinking that they might mark a grave Mr. Biddle, a man deeply interested in all that concerned the Columbia River, removed the rocks in the vicinity to a depth of several feet but encountered no further human evidence.3 Stylistically, the effigies (pl. 1) speak for themselves. They are anthropomorphic, the headdresses or hats and the clearly delineated ribs being their most outstanding characteristics. Prob- ably the effigies were originally painted but, if so, no trace of color remains and their surfaces are generally rough and decayed. The bottoms of the posts appear to have been pointed but decay makes this uncertain. I first saw these specimens in 1924 at Mr. Biddle's home near Vancouver, Washington, and urged him to bring them to scientific notice. He had the ac- companying photographs (pl. 1) made for me at that time but, to the best of my knowledge, they have since received little scientific attention. Because they represent rare survivals of an almost vanished art style on the Columbia River they seem well worthy of publication. Fortunately, documented examples of this same style were recently rescued from long obscurity by the late D. I. Bushnell, Jr. when he published sketches and illustrations of artifacts secured by the linguist-ethnologist, George Gibbs, in 1850 or 1851, from the Lower Chinook near the mouth of the Columbia., In addition to a sketch of a burial canoe with an elaborate and grotesque animal prow, Gibbs collected, among other things, a bone knife handle and a wooden spoon each of which is sur- mounted by a small animal having accentuated, carved ribs. An exquisite, small wooden bowl with open-work "comb" ends accompanies these. The American Museum of Natural History collections from the Tlingit in south- eastern Alaska contain almost identical specimens characterized by both hu- man and animal figures with carved ribs. This motif also occurs in the collections from other tribes of the northwest coast, but the closest known parallels to the Beacon Rock and other Columbia River effigies from the Dalles region are the Salish wooden figures with accen- tuated ribs, collected from the Quinault by Harlan I. Smith in 1889, examples 3 Among the Puyallup-Nisqually of Puget Sound, who shared a very similar culture with the Chinook, objects endowed with supernatural power (which included carved wooden human heads and torsos about three feet long when stuck in the ground) were never placed with the owner's body but were either passed on before death, or carried away by a .person not related to the family and buried or hidden away. This person never told where the effigies had been placed. It is also significant that among these people, and probably many of their neighbors, there is both a conceptual and linguistic identity between the human ghost and the skeleton. This has a direct bearing on ethnological-archeological correlations suggested in the present paper.

Finally, there are a number of wooden, as well as stone, effigies and carved artifacts mostly from the vicinity of The Dalles on the Columbia River, executed in the same or in more elaborate style and often marked by ribs. These are reported to be from the Wasco or Wishram Indians, or from burial sites, such as Memaloose Island, in their vicinity. Examples of these occur in the Chicago Natural History Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, and probably in other museums and collections in this country and in Canada. A thorough study of such materials would have great value but is far beyond the purposes of the present article. Such specimens are mentioned here primarily to demonstrate that anthro- pomorphic and animalistic effigies which suggest the dead by clearly accen- tuated ribs occur in perishable wood and, in some cases, are of known ethnic provenience. These facts objectively link this art style in time with that of the wooden carvings on the lower Columbia so briefly and tantalizingly described by the explorers and traders of the early 19th century. The early white settlers on Sauvies Island, at the confluence of the Willam- ette and Columbia Rivers, also found Indian depositories of the dead along the eastern shore which were, in some cases, apparently associated with quite elaborately carved stone figures. Discussion with a few of the surviving white pioneers, in 1924, indicated that the burials were for the most part in trees with the stone images sometimes occurring on the ground beneath. Other bur- ied stone sculptures that had been washed out from the banks of the river during periods of unusually high water were found here, at Wapato Island a few miles down the Columbia, and elsewhere in the vicinity. To the best of my knowledge none of these interesting human or animal stone effigies has yet been found in situ by a qualified archeologist. Their authenticity, however, will be obvious to any trained observer who has the opportunity to study the specimens in the Oregon Historical Society at Portland, or in the few other collections where they occur. Several examples are illustrated here (fig. 1) primarily to indicate the occurrence in durable stone of the same art style marked by skeletal accentuation, particularly rib delineation, which marks the rarer wooden carvings preserved from the same region. Human beings are depicted either in the round (fig. 1 a, d, f), or by incision or petroglyphic tech- nique (fig. 1 e). Many of the human effigies show clearly delineated ribs (fig. 1 a, e, f, and d faintly) but not all. Animals also occur, the owl (fig. 1 c), the 6 Douglas and d'Harnoncourt, 1941, p. 165. Concerning Salish wood carving, see the com- prehensive study now in preparation by Paul S. Wingert, of Columbia University, which should help to bring this significant art style to the attention of both artists and scientists.</page><page sequence="6">iff? ;PSI:r rep., 7F -c % 41, .?.?1? ???r f f : .(pj *0 ;MV~?:?=. : Pitr ~2, ~?I ~ , A05? ?=.~.!6 -4r- '44-i~ ?+ ? ~ ?. ? ? .?.ar .

In regard to bird effigies the rib and wing motifs are indistinguishable (fig. 1 c) but there seems good reason to suspect an ideational connection. This art style occurs up the Columbia beyond The Dalles, on Puget Sound, and north along Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland to Alaska.7 Many effigies have from one to three cupuliform cavities on the breast (fig. 1 a, c), on the top of the head, or else the body forms a bowl with head and tail projecting. This last form suggests similar bed-rock petroglyphs in the same style to be mentioned later. Quite possibly these cavities were for fish oil or other offerings. The anthropomorphic form with ribs, sometimes surmounted by an elabo- rate hat or headdress, occurs commonly in petroglyphs in the same general area. An excellent example from the Wishram village at Spedis, on the Washington side of The Dalles, is shown here (pl. 2 upper). This large and deeply incised figure is said by local Indians to represent one of the spirit-guardians of the fishing places on the narrows where salmon are caught with dip nets. There are a number of these petroglyphs at this site and elsewhere in the vicinity. At high water, the Spedis examples are covered but emerge when the water drops and the dip-netting season approaches. In 1924, these "Guardians of the Fish- ing Places" still seemed to be held in considerable reverence by the Indians, whether as supernatural fishing aids or as family fishing-station markers was not determined. Old Wishram informants told us that the deep petroglyphs had been made by their own ancestors long ago and that they represented water animals who were the particular spirits of their ancestors. They said the numerous red pictographs and shallow petroglyphs on the rim rock in the gen- eral vicinity were made by a different, very ancient people, and no one knew how they were made. Since the latter sometimes include mounted men on horses, I suspect that people of other tribes may have made them, but perhaps not so very long ago. Sites for petroglyphs are relatively rare in the drowned river valley of the lower Columbia, but at least one large, but rather crude example of this type of ribbed human with a bed-rock mortar in the pit of its stomach occurs just back of the Fisher's Landing dock on the Washington shore above Vancouver. Similar large anthropomorphic forms, with ribs, in- cised on flat boulders occur as far north as the Bella Coola River on the coast of British Columbia.8 The problem raised by such distributions is a fascinating one but only its existence and barest implications can be mentioned here. 6 Smith, 1907, fig. 198b.

These remarkable carvings were found by Julian Steward in cremation pits on Miller's Island at the confluence of the Deschutes and Columbia Rivers.9 Since the cremation pits contain small fragments of iron they are believed to be of early proto-historic date (i.e., circa 1750) but certain of the artifacts may be of a considerably earlier period. The fragmentary carvings from these and nearby cremation pits show a remarkable blending of geometric Plateau and realistic Northwest Coast stylistic influences, but the ribbed figures with headdresses (examples shown here, pl. 2 lower) are clearly in the "ghost" style which has been shown to be represented in wood, stone and petroglyph on the lower and middle Columbia, around Puget Sound, and in western British Columbia. Thus, this "ghost" style of carving is historic on the lower Columbia since it occurs on specimens of known ethnological provenience as well as other perishable wooden effigies (pl. 1) which could not have survived much longer than since 1800; is protohistoric, since it occurs on bone artifacts from proto- historic sites on the middle Columbia (pl. 2, lower); and may also be pre- historic, and equally characteristic of an earlier period, since it occurs in, or on, imperishable stone (pl 2, upper and fig. 1), not only localized on the Columbia the rib motif ancJ the beliefs of the Indians concerning such sculptures is mentioned by Keithahn, 1940, pp. 123-132. Keithahn believes that these petroglyphic sculptures were ancestral to the wood-carver's art in this region. Considering the great amount of scientific and other writing engendered by the famous art style of the Northwest Coast proper, it is strange that so little has been attempted toward determining its actual antecedents and origins. In the greaternorth- west the dearth of large scale, modern archeological research, closely tied in with ethnological and historical insight, has probably been the greatest preventive. See Drucker, 1943, whose recent field reconnaissance and excellent report indicate that truly scientific excavations on an adequate scale will yield important results in this promising but neglected field. Regarding petroglyphs and pictographs of the Columbia River region, no comprehensive report has yet appeared. Cressman, 1937, entirely, albeit intentionally, ignores the highly important Columbia River region. For the middle Columbia River region, H. W. Krieger of the U. S. National Museum has much unpublished data the publication of which would have great value. The present author also has considerable data on this general area which has been lying fallow for some twenty years, despite the fact that it is, and in the past has been, repeatedly offered to and occasionally utilized by other students. Pressure of other duties now as in the past preventing full preparation of these materials, it seems worthwhile at least to point out the existence of such data and some of the wider implications they appear to contain.

More recently a stone bowl from Miller's Island with incised designs strongly suggesting Northwest Coast designs, but still localized and unique, has been figured and analyzed by Heizer and discussed by Smith, 1943, pp. 158-160. The face designs on this bowl are strikingly reminiscent of Tsagiglalal, "She who watches you as you go by," a large petroglyph on the rim rock overlook- ing the Wishram village at Spedis, Washington.

Until archaeology on something approaching an adequate scale, working from the historic into the prehistoric, has been attempted in the greater North- west we will probably get no positive clue as to relative age of the imperishable stone effigies marked by the death, or ghost, symbol of exposed ribs. However, the occurrence of the same symbol specifically, and effigy style generally, on the wooden and bone effigies collected by George Gibbs, as well as those here figured (pls. 1, 2) and discussed, indicates that the "ghost" style, and whatever ideas or cult it symbolized persisted down into early historic times. Thus, despite the fact that inadequate archeology at the moment prevents a positive linking of historic and prehistoric manifestations in the region, the demonstra- ble recency of certain of the motifs in question does seem to justify an attempt. to correlate them with ethnological studies and historic records. A few quotations from Spier's penetrating analytic study of certain early historic, religious phenomena which he designates as the "Prophet Dance of the Northwest" are at least suggestive of a possible ethno-archaeological cor- relation in this regard.10 It is the purpose of this section of this paper to show that the ultimate origin of the two Ghost Dance movements [1870, 1890] was not the Paviotso but in the Northwest among the tribes of the interior Plateau area. It can be shown that among these peo- ples there was an old belief in the impending destruction and renewal of the world, when the dead would return, in conjunction with which there was a dance based on sup- posed imitation of the dances of the dead, and a conviction that intense preoccupation with the dance would hasten the happy day. From time to time men "died" and re- turned to life with renewed assurances of the truth of the doctrine; at intervals cata- clysms of nature occurred which were taken as portents of the end. Each of these events led to the performance of the dance with renewed fervor, only to have it fall into abey- ance again when their expectations remained unfulfilled. This northwestern cult agrees precisely with the core of the Ghost Dance religion among the Paviotso, and the cir- cumstances of its appearance among the latter parallel those of earlier date in the Northwest. Not only is it demonstrable that the Ghost Dance parallels the Prophet Dance of the Plateau tribes and that the latter is known as long antecedent to the Ghost Dance movements, but it can be shown that the Prophet Dance was thoroughly at home in the cultures of the northwest, which cannot be maintained for the Ghost Dance in relation to Paviotso culture. It is also evident that basic elements of the complex were an integral part of Northwest Coast culture as well as that of the Plateau, which in turn argues for their antiquity. One of the most striking features of Northwest Coast mythology is the occurrence of numerous tales concerning visits of the living with the dead. Many of these narrate 10 Spier, 1935, pp. 5, 13, 16-17.</page><page sequence="11">254 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 purely mythical adventures but quite as frequently they are couched as historical happenings. Similar tales are known from the Plateau tribes, although they are perhaps not quite so common. Further, the stage was set for seeming resurrections on the coast, at least at its southern end, where premature burial seems to have been not at all un- common. It is therefore not surprising that it is this very region which provides records of men having "died" and returned from the afterworld in precise parallel to the Pla- teau prophets. Several of these resurrections are known from western Washington. A Kathlamet informant dictated a tale of his grandfather's "death" and visit with the dead at the time of the small-pox epidemics (probably 1820-40). [See Footnote 12, Boas, 1901, pp. 247-251.] From the Makah there is a similar historic tale of a man who died, visited the dead, and was sent back because he was still alive. This was said to have taken place about 1858. Swan wrote that it was Makah habit to be precipitous in binding up and even burying an individual on his seeming death, without making sure that no life re- mained. If this was so, a return from seeming death may not have been uncommon. It does not seem that there is any comparable constant concern with the dead in any of the areas to the south or east. It is particularly to the point to note that in the Great Basin, aside from the specific occasions of the Ghost Dance revivals, there is no such preoccupation. That is, the Basin cultures show no more than the random rela- tions with the dead we find in the Plains or elsewhere in North America. It does not seem we can lay this negative situation to the paucity of accounts of the Basin tribes. In short, there seems to be real significance in the recurring relations with the dead in northwestern cultures, which I see as establishing a groundwork from which the Prophet Dance complex could arise. Certainly this ethno-historic record of a "cult of the dead" that spread over the greater northwest in early historic and possibly still earlier times coincides in a rather remarkable mahnner with the known distribution of the tangible skeletal art motifs we have previously discussed. Concerning the exact symbolism of the Prophet Dance and its later derivatives there are a few indications that an'accentuation of the bare or hollow rib motif is ethno- logical as well as archeological. (See footnote 3.) G. P. Murdock tells me that this is true among the Tenino, and Spier quotes Curtis concerning the "thin and raw-boned" appearance of the dead encountered by a Yakima prophet. However, this is a matter for expert ethnological consideration and is offered here merely for what it may prove to be worth. What is most significant is the fact that Spier, by ethnological analysis, demonstrates that the roots of the historic ghost dances (1870, 1890) can be traced back another century at least, and that now archeology suggests that they may be still older. However deeply rooted this concern with death and the return of the dead may have been, it is worthy of note that the tragic manner and speed with which the native population of the lower Columbia valley disappeared should</page><page sequence="12">STRONG] "GHOST CULT" ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 255 certainly have accentuated this feeling. Lewis and Clark, the first white men to come down the Columbia, noted many abandoned villages and, al- ready, many evidences of white contact by way of the Pacific. They record two or three cases of gonorrhea and six of syphilis on the lower river but state that, while these diseases occurred, the number of natives affected was incon- siderable. Less than ten years later, in 1814, Alexander Henry notes the rapid spread and terrible prevalence of these diseases that occurred after 1810. This was the date when white traders established themselves at the mouth of the Columbia, bringing such infections in "not only from New York but also from the Sandwich Islands.""' One generation of whites practically saw this sad process of extinction completed. Writing in 1906, the father of the present writer states: Queen Sally, of Cathlamet, was the oldest living Indian on the Lower Columbia in the late fifties and early sixties, and her memory went back easily to the days of Lewis and Clark when she was a young woman old enough to be married, which, with the Indians, meant about the age of fourteen. Seventy years is extreme old age for an In- dian, and especially for an Indian woman, but Queen Sally was all of this. Judging from her looks she might have been anywhere in the centuries, for never was a more wrinkled, smoke-begrimed, wizened old creature. Princess Angeline, of Seattle, was a blooming young beauty beside her. It gave one a far-away feeling, in regard to the event not warranted by the years that had passed, when from the cliffs above Cathlamet she pointed out the spot where the canoes of Lewis and Clark were first seen. She said the Indians had been on the watch for them for several days, as news had come by Indian post of the strangers from the East. Lewis and Clark with their party came in the afternoon or evening, and were met by the Indians in their canoes at or a little above the modern town of Cathlamet and escorted to the Indian village, which was then on the slough below Cathlamet, at about the point where the saw mill now is. How long they stayed here she could not clearly tell. It was evident she confused their westward and eastward trips and also their winter stay at Clatsop with their stay at Cathlamet village. Twenty-five miles to wandering Indians is a bagatelle of too little importance to be considered in fixing a lo- cality. It was a time of feasting, wonderment and council making. Lewis and Clark were doubtless weary of Indians by this time, but the strange sights they saw will never be seen again."" Thus, while my father grew up in close association with many Indians at Cathlamet village, some of whom remembered the visit of Lewis and Clark, the writer, who spent his early years on the Columbia has, to the best of his knowledge, never seen a Chinook of the lower river. n Coues, 1897, Vol. II, p. 836 and fn. 9. 12 Strong, 1930, pp. 5-7. Thomas Nelson'Strong was born at Cathlamet in 1853 and died in 1927. Boas, 1901, while collecting his Kathlamet Texts in 1890 and 1891, reports finding only three speakers of the Kathlamet dialect, all living in other towns. J. P. Harrington, however, tells me that within the last few years he has located several other speakers in the state of Wash- ington.</page><page sequence="13">256 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 The passing of the natives of the lower Columbia, and its psychological concomitants, is thus described by one who knew the Indians well.13 Another curious question has to do with the scanty native population of Western Oregon and Washington when first known by the white men. The range was limitless and food abundant beyond measure. The country could have supported easily five times the number of native people that were on it. These Indians always claimed that they were once a populous and powerful people, but that in some way they had pro- voked the Divine anger and been destroyed, and this claim is undoubtedly based upon fact, and on this question, although there are uncertainties regarding the manner of the decimation of the Indians of the Willamette and Lower Columbia Rivers, we have something definite to go on. This decimation began before the first white settlers came, and was largely finished before 1830. None of the histories give any idea of the number of Indians who inhabited this region before historic times, and this can only be conjec- tured, but it is certain that once a commensurate Indian population filled Western Oregon from the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Every aged Indian told stories of a time when the rivers were lined with villages and floated many canoes. At Marr's Landing, about three miles below Castle [Beacon] Rock, on the Colum- bia, the river has in the last few years been washing away what is known as the island, and has uncovered the site of old Indian campfires. These stretch in a long line up and down the beach. They are covered with two or three feet of loam, and on this fir trees a hundred years old have grown. As many as fifteen or twenty stone hammers have been found about a single fireplace, and these old charred fires are preserved as they were 200 years ago. One pathetic little relic found amongst the big stone hammers was a tiny little hammer and pestle, evidently play-things of an Indian child. On Archer Mountain, a mile or two west, are what appear to be ancient for- tifications that would have required many warriors to man. No village of this magni- tude was known there by white men. In the days of Lewis and Clark there was only a scattering settlement near Castle Rock, and a migratory trading band at the Cas- cades. The Indian flint factory at the Clackamas River suggests a large population, and Cathlamet was always a greater city of the dead than of the living. Between the Eloko- mon and the Skamokawa the sloughs were lined with the burial canoes of the dead, and as only distinguished men were so buried, this stood for a very large population, probably greater than that of the Bella-Bella Indian Village in British Columbia. These canoe burials were ancient to say the least. Cedarwood is almost indestructible, and no living Indians knew the name or lineage of the dead or resented the resurrection that the white children accomplished in searching for Indian ornaments. They tumbled the bones out of the bed of loam and leaves that had gathered over them, and they were the bones of a hundred years gone. In sport the children put them together and specu- lated upon what manner of men they were, and the Indian children joined in the game, for the dead were the old, old people. Below the Indian village the ground was black and the plough turned up countless skulls and bones with flints and Indian arrowheads, bespeaking long occupation and a numerous population. 13 Strong, 1930, pp. 50-57.</page><page sequence="14">STRONG] "GHOST CULT" ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 257 Long before 1800 the Indian had evidently reached the height of his power and prosperity, and when the white man came was already on the way to extinction. The waning of the Indian power of the Lower Columbia is shrouded in mystery. Young Indian girls told the story of it in hushed whispers, and the old Indians spoke of it reluctantly. Had the Death Angel come in bodily form they could not have been more impressed. The wail for the dead, so they said, was heard all along the rivers, and no one even hoped for life when the slaughter was on. The Indians named the chief instrument of destruction the "Cole sick." With the white man came the smallpox and the measles, but the "Cole sick" was neither of these. About 1820 and 1830 epidemics of the old disease swept among the remaining Indians, and historians are puzzled to give it a name. One suggests that fever and ague came with the settlers, but the Valley of the Co- lumbia was never a fever and ague country and the pioneers, however malaria stricken at the beginning, must have been thoroughly disinfected by their long trip across the plains. Others say that the turning up of the soil by the Hudson's Bay people at the farms at Fort Vancouver released malaria from the soil and this caused the epidemic, but the disease was here before the farms, and it was impossible that a disease which raged over hundreds of square miles could have come from so trivial a cause. It may have been the modern la grippe striking an unprotected people. Whatever it was no more potent angel of death ever visited an afflicted people. The white man had no need of war or violence in his dealings with these Indians, nor did he employ them, for the "Sahalee Tyee," the Indian god, had struck before him. The foregoing description of rapid tribal and cultural breakdown, accom- panied by extreme population decline, on the lower Columbia River in the far west, according to at least one interpretation, finds a close parallel in the last stages of native cultural history in the Mississippi River region to the east. Further, these manifestations, on both seaboards, seem to have been accom- panied by somewhat similar, although differently derived, psychic and cult manifestations. In this regard a recent archeological analysis and anthropo- logical summary of the region of the eastern United States concludes:14 Toward the end of this stage it can be seen that a marked decrease in population is occurring. In areas where sites of the early and late Middle Mississippian cultures must have been numbered in the thousands, not an Indian was to be found in the latter part of the seventeenth century when the French and English explorers entered the region. This is particularly true for the Mississippi and Ohio valleys and for much of the coun- try covered by the Tennessee-Cumberland and Lamar cultures. During the Temple Mound II stage there appears to have arisen a curious cult which shows little relationship to anything which has previously transpired, and which spread rapidly over the entire Mississippi Valley area, although most common in the south. The paraphernalia from which the presence of this cult is deduced show a high degree of similarity all over the area. Included are such items as conch shell masks marked with the winged or "weeping" eye symbol; copper and shell pendants with circles and crosses engraved, repousse, or with background cut out; engraved 14 Ford and Willey, 1941, pp. 357-359.</page><page sequence="15">258 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 conch shells or thin copper plates on which are depicted dancing figures wearing eagle masks, carrying a human head in one hand and a peculiar shaped baton in the other; shell gorgets showing fighting turkey cocks or rattlesnakes; monolithic stone axes; large stone batons; the horned and winged rattlesnake engraved on circular paint palettes or on pottery; and fairly large stone figures with negroid faces and characteristic arrange- ment of hair in two rolls on the top of the head.15 Some items of this paraphernalia have been found at nearly every site of this period which has been thoroughly investigated. However, some of the larger centers have be- come well known for the quantity of these materials which they have yielded. Outstand- ing are the Kincaid and Angell sites near the mouth of the Ohio River, the Etowah site in north Georgia, Moundville in central Alabama, and Spiro in eastern Oklahoma. Al- though the cult which spread these objects probably flourished about 1600, there are some finds showing that certain features, at least, lasted until after 1700. The suggestion of Mexican influence in these objects has been recognized.'6 Aside from that, there is a great temptation to interpret these objects as evidence of some sort of religious revival quite similar in purpose to the well known Ghost Dance cult of the Plains. This, also, may be the evidence of a reaction to a rapid decimation of the popu- lation of a formerly vigorous and thriving culture. Early contacts with Europeans may have brought among the native peoples highly contagious and, to them, very fatal new diseases such as measles, smallpox, chol- era, etc. DeSoto's party of exploration across the south, 1539-1543; the early settlement of the Virginia coast, 1607; Spanish Missions and settlements in Florida and Georgia following 1520, may all have served as foci of contagion. The early disappearance of the native peoples from Florida and the vicinity of the Atlantic coastal settlements is well attested by the historical sources.'" The same cause, the impact of highly destructive epidemics, may account for the change of population centers noted above. In the thickly settled valleys of the larger rivers the epidemics would have been most destructive. The surviving remnants aban- doned the old villages and gathered in new settlements back in the hills. Perhaps the unrest of the period is reflected in the compact settlements and extensive use of stock- ades. Much of the widespread scattering of peoples, notably the Yuchi, may have oc- curred at this time. These same factors may also account for some of the curious mixed villages described bout 1700 such as the Yazoo, Tunica, Coroa, and Ofogoula, gathered into a village on the Yazoo River in Mississippi. It is suggested that the native peoples and culture, as described about 1700, were, for the most part, already a broken people with a declining culture. While agreeing on the late occurrence of this complex of exotic archeolog- ical motifs in the Southeast, and demonstrating that their apparent Mixteca- Puebla cast may possibly be explained as a direct transmission through the numerous Mexican Indians brought to Florida by the De Luna expedition in 1559, Griffin doubts that the "death symbols" and other motifs had any con- nection with a "ghost dance" or "death cult." He states: "Some students have 16 Waring and Holder, 1945. 16 Phillips, 1940, pp. 349 if. 17 Swanton, 1935.</page><page sequence="16">STRONG] "GHOST CULT" ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 259 viewed these art styles as the expression of a religious revival brought about during a fanciful period of decline and decay of southeastern culture.4 In the writer's opinion the art styles resembling Mexican forms are a part of the cul- ture at the highest aboriginal level of accomplishment and represent not a stage of retrogression in the Southeast but its apogee."'8 This difference of opinion will undoubtedly be settled by more exact ar- cheological correlations and, quite possibly, by new (or newly interpreted) historical and ethnological data. In this regard it should be noted, as the ar- cheological record of the Pawnee, Arikara and Mandan in the Great Plains so strongly indicates, that the protohistoric period of first contact with an alien culture may mark both the apogee of the autochthonous culture and the moment of its rapid decline, So far as I am aware, no ethnologist has yet pointed out ethno-historical evidence of a "Death" or "Prophet Dance" in the Southeast, as Spier has done for the greater northwest. More data on these problems will undoubtedly be forthcoming. In the meantime, the present writer finds the parallelism, here so sketchily indicated, between the psychic, cultural and demographic manifestations of the closing stages of native culture on the greatest eastern and greatest western waterways in the territory of the United States a very suggestive one. As yet such correlations are not clearly established in either the Southeast or the greater northwest. However, it is most encouraging that ethnology and archaeology, in some areas of the New World, are at last converging so closely that such significant problems emerge almost of their own volition. Thus, in the Southeast the possibility of the occurrence of a protohistoric revivalistic cult with Mexican resemblances has been first indicated through archeological techniques, whereas, in the greater northwest, ethno-historical analysis clearly indicates the early and wide spread of a Prophet Dance concerned with death and revival, long anterior but ancestral to the later well-known Ghost Dances. As the foregoing discussion attempts to point out, there is a good chance that archeology in the Northwest-beginning in contact sites and working back- ward in time-can objectively correlate the material phenomena here inter- preted as indicating a "Ghost Cult" with those social phenomena which Spier calls the Prophet Dance. If this correlation is established and archeology dem- onstrates that these "death and revival" phenomena in the west are actually pre-Columbian, considerable re-orientation in current hypotheses concerning the causation of such messianic or revivalistic phenomena will be necessary. On the other hand, if such correlated ethnological and archeological re- searches in the west and in the east confirm the present protohistoric or first contact dating for such revivalistic phenomena, in conjunction with rapid de- population and cultural breakdown, other important world-wide problems of s1 Griffin, 1944, pp. 299-303.</page><page sequence="17">260 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 traumatic culture contact between alien peoples are posed. Few of the current population estimates for aboriginal America seriously consider this obscure but obviously important factor, yet archeological and historical research in the Southeast, the Great Plains and, apparently, the greater northwest, indi- cates that just prior to the period of recorded French and English exploration the native populations, particularly the sedentary riparian peoples, had al- ready been largely displaced and apparently nearly exterminated. If we are to understand the historical and biological causes for such phenomena, as well as the demographic and psychological results therefrom, it is obvious that we must have many more penetrating studies wherein ethno-histotical analy- sis and synthesis are fused with historically creative archeology. Such corre- lated studies alone can establish a specific temporal framework for such non- literate societies within which the demographer, epidemiologist, and art his- torian, as well as the sociologically or psychologically minded student of culture dynamics and personality, can at last operate with historically cali- brated tools.
