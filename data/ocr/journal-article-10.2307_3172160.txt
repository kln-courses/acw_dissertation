E. Evans-Pritchard, the Azande are among the best-known African peoples. In anthropological theory they have become indissolubly associated with the study of religion and magic. Also remarkable is their expansion under the leadership of the dynasties of the Avungara and the originally Ngbandi-speaking Abandia. Starting from a small core area in the basin of the lower Mbomu, where the ancestors of the Avungara and Abandia had estab- lished themselves as rulers over parts of the resident, mainly Zande- speaking, population around the middle of the eighteenth century, the Abandia extended their rule into the region of the lower Mbomu and lower Uele, while the Avungara and their Azande followers swept eastward in a vast movement and in less than one hundred years con- quered a huge area reaching as far as the upper Sue and upper Uele, integrating the population into their system of rule. One of the reasons for the speed of this expansion is that indi- vidual members of the Avungara dynasty (who all claimed descent from Ngura, the first historical ruler in the lower Mbomu area) re- peatedly founded principalities of their own in new territories. This led to the existence of a varying number of polities under numerous, more or less, powerful rulers who descended from several dynastic 1This paper is an abridged version of the first chapter of my book, Vorkoloniale Geschichte und Expansion der Avungara-Azande: Eine quellenkritische Untersu- chung (Cologne, 2000).

Through the integration of numerous groups of different linguistic and ethnic origins, the population cluster was formed for which the collective name Azande has become established. The history of Azande expansion thus provides a very interesting ex- ample of a society being created through political processes, which raises questions concerning the origin, acceptance, and characteristics of centralized political organizations, as well as assimilation and acculturation processes (besides the Mangbetu in the Uele-Bomokandi area, the Azande were the only group in the region to develop central- ized political structures on a wide scale). From the middle of the nineteenth century the societies of the Nile- Congo watershed were confronted with global political and economic developments. In the course of the conquest of modern Sudan by Ot- toman Egypt, ivory and slave traders from the northern Sudanese Nile valley-the so-called "Khartoumers"-penetrated the region of the Bahr al-Ghazal and Bahr al-Jabal and also established themselves as new powers in the area of the Azande and Mangbetu. This period of Turco-Egyptian rule is particularly significant for a general evaluation of the changes which the societies of central and eastern Africa under- went in the nineteenth century due to the penetration of traders from the northern Sudan and the Swahili coast, and the consequent integra- tion into the world economy. Considering the role of the Azande in African studies, it is all the more surprising that the relevant sources for their history have never been subjected to serious critical examination. Our knowledge is still based mainly on works from the early colonial period and on the studies published by Evans-Pritchard, who himself drew on these early works and their theoretical assumptions.2 A study of the sources clearly shows how the established western epistemological categories constantly have influenced presentation of the facts, thereby obstruct- ing the scientific view of the culture, and especially the history, of the Azande. Here a continuity can be observed between the earliest testi- monies, strongly influenced by cliches, and scholarly twentieth-cen- tury studies. Just as in the "magic thinking" of the Azande, the inter- pretation of facts in the scholarly literature is marked by unexpressed cultural axioms, which fulfil certain sociopolitical functions.

The literature on the Azande begins in the mid-nineteenth century with an impressive example of stereotyped perception and transmis- sion of clich6s, i.e., with a discussion which today appears ludicrous on whether the central African "Niam-Niam" have a tail like animals or even dogs' heads.3 Today the term "Niam-Niam" used by northern Sudanese traders, which is believed to refer to anthropophagy, is con- sidered to be a name for the Azande in the sources of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In fact, the term does not necessarily re- fer to the Azande-or rather it originally had nothing at all to do with the Azande. The idea that the interior of Africa was inhabited by sav- age man-eaters called Niam-Niam who sometimes had animal charac- teristics attributed to them is, to be precise, a para-ethnographic clich6 or Wandermotiv, originating from the Arabic cultural area and which can be traced to the geographical and cosmographical litera- ture of the Middle Ages.4 The name was used by Arab scholars of the Middle Ages in various forms-the most frequent being "Lamlam" and "Damdam," but "Namnam" also occurs-as a general term for the peoples living at the extreme edge of Africa as it was then known, and especially on the periphery of the Bilad al-Sudan. Their chief characteristics were considered to be cannibalism, incorrigible pagan- ism, nudity, and backwardness, in other words: closeness to the ani- mal world.5 3Cf. the summary of this discussion by Jean-Dominique PNnel, Homo Caudatus.

Although all these forms represent the same general collective term for infidel cannibals, corresponding to the modern variants Niam-Niam, Yam-Yam, etc., the etymology is extremely problematical for several reasons, starting with the extreme variability of the graphic representation.

The groups he referred to can be lo- calized to the region of Niani, in the core area of the empire of Mali which was to develop a hundred years later.7 In the following centuries the pagan fringe peoples designated by this term in geographical works seem to multiply, apparently at the same rate as the Arabs increased their knowledge of Africa and Islam spread. Thus scholars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries-Ibn Sacid, al-Dimashqi, Abu'l-Fida' and Ibn Khaldun-mentioned, in ad- dition to the already known Lamlam south of the Islamized Niger states,8 "their brothers" (Ibn Sacid) the Namnam, located further south on a tributary of the Niger,9 as well as naked pagan Damdam south of Nubia and Ethiopia, beyond the equator, who had laid waste these countries in the thirteenth century. Through this shift to the east and south, the notion of savage cannibalistic fringe peoples became associated with the traditional geographical Arab dogma concerning XVIe siecle (Bilad al-Sudan) (Paris, 1975), 6, 13-14, 108nl, 130n2, 205n3, 241n3; Raymond Mauny, Tableau gdographique de I'ouest africain au Moyen Age d'apres les sources ecrites, la tradition et I'archbologie (Dakar, 1961), 447, 459; idem, "Lamlam" Encyclopaedia of Islam, 5:651.

Here the "three Niles"-the actual Nile "of Egypt," the "Nile of Ghana" or "of the Sudan" (Niger and Senegal, which were confused with each other) and the "Nile of Maqdishu" (probably the river Webi)-all had their source in a lake into which flow ten rivers origi- nating from the Qmr mountains south of the equator (identified with the mountains that Ptolemy took to be the source of the Nile, the Montes Lunae), after having first fed two other lakes.'0 The "Damdam" who threatened Ethiopia and Nubia were associated with the "Nile of Maqdishu,"'' while the region of the headwaters of the Nile as far as the lake, was, according to the geographers, generally inhabited by various kinds of cannibals, to whom the names Damdam and Tamim (or Tamnam, or, according to a different reading, Yamyam or Namnam) were applied.12 It can be seen that the Arab concept of the Lamlam, Damdam, etc., which by the beginning of the fifteenth century had taken on fixed contours and become widespread, had little geographical and ethno- graphical value, but was mainly the result of attempts at systematiza- tion and of ideological tendencies. It represented not much more than a vague notion of peoples who were practically unknown, but felt to be extremely "savage," located beyond the explored areas or even in the deepest interior of Africa at places favored for mythical creation such as the sources of the Nile and the regions south of the equator. They were the far-off slave country, exploited by the Islamic king- doms of the Bilad al-Sudan but not integrated; otherwise they were known only through their violent but short-lived incursions into "civilized" countries.

Any real information concerning the peoples associated with this concept took second place in the reports. The gratuitous (from today's point of view) application of the term reflects the speculative system- atizing principle of establishing a relationship between all known items of information and grouping all that is unknown under a single heading, which formed the basis of the geography of the interior of Africa right into the nineteenth century. The supposed existence of animal-like inhabitants at the edges of the earth served mainly to pro- vide affirmation of one's own culture. The Lamlam/Damdam/ Namnam must be classified among those fabulous peoples located at the edge of the world, to whom, in classical antiquity already and also in the European Middle Ages, all imaginable characteristics indicating their "uncivilized" state were attributed. In nineteenth-century Eu- ropean reports, the "Niam-Niam" idea was hardly different, despite claims to positivistic thinking. III Although the term "Lamlam," "Damdam," and the like had entered European geography as early as the sixteenth century,13 from the end of the eighteenth century travelers and explorers brought direct re- ports-apparently made credible by their personal presence-of pur- portedly cannibalistic peoples who were mostly called "Yam-Yam" or "Niam-Niam" (really still "Namnam" in Arabic).The earliest men- tion of the term in modern travel literature was by William George Browne, who was the first European known to visit the eastern Sudanic kingdom of Dar Fur in the 1790s. He spoke of "a remote part of the pagan country, from which slaves are brought, which the Arabs distinguish by the term Gnum Gnum, (a sobriquet,) whose inhabitants eat the flesh of the prisoners they take in war."14 '3Also in the European sources with different variants and localizations. For ex- ample, Leo Africanus mentioned a kingdom of Temiam south of the Niger king- doms (ed. A. Epaulard, Description de I'Afrique [2 vols.: Paris, 1956, transl. of the Italian Raniusio edition: Venice, 1500], 1:10), the Calabrian scholar Giovanni Lorenzo d'Anania mentioned a "lamiam" area in the interior of West Africa (L'universale fabrica del mondo, overo cosmografia [2nd ed.: Venice, 1576; 1st ed. Naples, 1573], 286). In d'Anvilles map of Africa (1749) there are "Lem-Lem" south of the Niger on a "Lem-Lem river" (J. D. Fage, An Atlas of African History [London, 1963], 34).

Information about such people came to Europe from the Niger area and the central Sudan, as well as from the region of the upper Nile, the two main areas where European interest was concentrated at the time. Thus there is a whole series of reports of "Yem-Yem" south of Bornu and of the Hausa states (from about 1810, the Sokoto caliph- ate). In his compilation of information received from traders during his journey to Fezzan, Friedrich Konrad Hornemann mentioned "yem-yem" cannibals (now with an animal tail) ten days' march south of Kano, but he did not rate the credibility of his informant very highly.'6 According to travelers who followed Hornemann, the topos was used mainly to refer to the non-Muslim inhabitants of the newly-founded emirate of Bauchi. Several authors continued to be sceptical about such reports, which, as far the sources allow us to say, seem to originate from Muslim traders from North Africa. Hugh Clapperton called the story of the "Yemyem" inhabitants of Bauchi "an idle Arab tale" that on closer inquiry could not be confirmed by direct testimonies." James Richardson expressed a similar opinion.18 Nevertheless, the idea of cannibalistic infidels, whether with or without Yem-Yem nicknames, seems to have been widespread among the Fulbe ruling classes as well. On Clapperton's second journey to Sokoto, Muhammad Bello confirmed the existence of cannibals in Bauchi, but without calling them Yem-Yem.19 Richard Lander also 1s Cf. among others Arlette Thuriaux-Hennebert, Les Zande dans I'histoire du Bahr el Ghazal et de I'Equatoria (Brussels, 1964), 21; eric de Dampierre, Un an- cien royaume Bandia du Haut-Oubangui (Paris, 1967), 59-61; Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 70, 110; and Dennis D.

Before Europeans began their search for the sources of the Nile, the "Niam-Niam" ("Namnam") in the eastern Sudan were mainly as- sociated with Dar Fur, the main source of slaves for Egypt. Until 1874 this sultanate was spared by the Turco-Egyptian expansion, so infor- mation about it between Browne's journey and that of Gustav Nachtigal (1873) had to be gained chiefly from traders. Other travel- ers apart from Browne also used the term. Based on information he received in Cairo from pilgrims coming from the Sudanic kingdoms west of Dar Fur, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, for instance, mentioned a country called "Yemyem" as being the target of slave raids carried out by the Sultanate of Wadai.23 Joseph Russegger was told-possibly in Kordofan (at that time a province of the Fur kingdom) in 1838- about the "Njem-Njem" cannibals south of the Nuba mountains be- 2oIn Clapperton, Journal of a Second Expedition, 284-85.

On closer scrutiny, the term referred to the Banda subgroups who inhabited the regions beyond the south- ernmost districts dependent on Wadai or Dar Fur (Dar Runga and Dar al-Kuti south of Wadai and the area stretching to the Bahr al- cArab south of Dar Fur) and thus were the most distant target of the slave raids.25 In his detailed account of the peoples of "Dar Fartit," the pagan countries south of Dar Fur, the traveler and scholar, Muhammad al-Tunisi, who from 1803 onward spent eight years in Dar Fur and one year in Wadai, distinguished two groups among the inhabitants of "Dar Benda" (Banda country): The "Benda Djoukou" and the anthropophagous "Benda Yamyam," who filed their front teeth into sharp points.26 Since al-Tunisi mentioned that the narrow loincloth worn by Fartit men was called a "djoukou," it is possible that the two names are based on a distinction between the "clothed," or more "civilized," Banda and the animal-like, cannibalistic Banda.27 Ignaz Pallme, a commercial agent from Bohemia who spent two years (1838/39) in Kordofan, gave a very naive picture of these 24Reisen in Europa, Asien und Afrika, mit besonderer Riicksicht auf die naturwissenschaftlichen Verhiiltnisse der betreffenden Liinder, unternommen in den Jabren 1835 bis 1841 (4 vols.: Stuttgart, 1841-49), 2/2:84, 353-55. 2SSee Gustav Nachtigal, Sahara und Sudan.

They are white-skinned, like the Arabs in Egypt, with beautiful big blue eyes, regular features, and a fine stature; they are called Bandanianiam (man-eaters) by the negroes. They are said to be descended from Jews.28 At the beginning of the twentieth century the Banda were still be- lieved to be anthropophagous. Overall, therefore, it is unlikely that Browne's passage referred to the Azande. This is confirmed by the fact that there are hardly any indications that the slave-hunting grounds of the eastern Sudanic states reached far beyond the Bahr al-CArab re- gion and the Nile-Chari-Congo watershed, where peoples lived who were referred to by the pejorative collective name Fartit (used for all non-Muslim groups south of Dar Fur who were subject to slave raids) in the early nineteenth century. These included the Runga, Kara, Yulu, Kresh, Binga, Banda, Feroge, and Shatt, and in general the inhabitants of the region around Hufrat al-Nahas, the copper mines on the Umbelasha known in the whole of the Bilad al-Sudan.29 Indications of more wide-ranging expeditions which, according to some authors, did reach the Azande, are very doubtful and would be related to iso- lated episodes even if they were true. 30 Contrary to the claims of many historians of Azande expansion then, any influence of Dar Fur and of slave raids from the eastern Sudan on the history of the Azande can be excluded.31 The "Niam-Niam," however, would not have achieved any fame of this kind if the scientific public in Europe had not also played its part in developing the "Niam-Niam" topos.

Three river expeditions sent out by the Viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad cAli, in which some Europeans participated, explored the course of the river in 1839-42, and the second expedi- tion actually succeeded in passing the barrier of the Nile swamps (sudd) and in sailing up the Bahr al-Jabal to beyond the fifth parallel. The broad interest aroused in Europe by these activities was backed up by an extensive body of writings of very uneven quality. IV The overcoming of the Nile swamps meant that it was possible to open up new trading areas. The main engine of this development was the cosmopolitan community of the town of Khartoum, founded in 1825. In the course of the 1850s merchants of various provenances- Frenchmen, Britons, Syrians, Egyptians, northern Sudanese-opened up to trade the two main areas of the southern Sudan which could be reached by water transport: the Bahr al-Jabal area and, following the discovery of the main branch of the river around 1855, the area of the tributaries of the Bahr al-Ghazal. At first ivory was the main com- modity exported by the boat expeditions which sailed up the Nile in the dry season. But around the end of the 1850s, a new pattern of trade developed that was marked by violence and is usually referred to as the zara'ib system.32 Due to the high costs of procuring ivory in these remote areas, the merchants began to establish permanent forti- fied trading stations or zara'ib (sing. zariba), meaning "fence of thorns." The wukala (sing. wakil) or agents of the owners of the trading companies resident in Khartoum, together with mercenary troops re- cruited from northern Sudan, gradually gained control over the sur- rounding areas using these zara'ib as bases. The earnings from ivory were soon supplemented by the slave trade, which was more profit- able and in which the soldiers were allowed to participate on their 32General accounts of the development of this trade in the southern Sudan can be found in Richard Gray, A History of the Southern Sudan 1839-1899 (London, 1961); Lawrence Mire, "AI-Zubayr Pasha and the Zariba Based Slave Trade in the Bahr al-Ghazal 1855-1879" in John Ralph Willis, ed., Slaves and Slavery in Mus- lim Africa, 2, The Servile Estate (London, 1985), 83-100; Janet Ewald, Soldiers, Traders, and Slaves: State Formation and Economic Transformation in the Greater Nile Valley, 1700-1885 (Madison, 1990), 143-78.</page><page sequence="13">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 101 own account, making it possible to keep large numbers of troops at no great cost. By expanding its sphere, the Khartoum trade met the older overland trade from Dar Fur, which was mainly oriented to slaves, and which reached as far as the region of the western Bahr al- Ghazal. At this time this was carried on mainly by jallaba, itinerant Muslim petty traders from the north. The jallaba, who until then had depended on local chiefs, found powerful bases in the zara'ib. From this symbiosis there developed a flourishing slave trade that bypassed the Nile route. Its protagonists were no longer European traders from Khartoum, but northern Sudanese settled in the southern Sudan, in- cluding the famous al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur from Jacali country in the northern river valley, who from his main base, Daym Zubayr, con- trolled larger and larger areas and achieved unprecedented power and wealth. The local communities were incorporated in a "firm pattern of alli- ances, subjection and hostility," in which allied local leaders were also able to expand their sphere of influence through the military support of the traders.33 Cattle raids served to feed the zara'ib soldiers and to consolidate relations with the friendly local chiefs. Up to 1870 the representatives of the trading companies, the majority of which had in the meantime passed into the hands of the northern Sudanese, Egyp- tian, and Syrian merchants resident in Khartoum, had divided control over the country among themselves and claimed sole use of the eco- nomic and human resources. The military strength of the zara'ib was increased by troops of bazinqir (soldiers with slave status). On the fringes of the expanded trading area in particular, "dragomans" (lit. "interpreters," frequently former slaves) served as negotiators and in- termediaries between the Khartoumers and the local communities and frequently rose to leading positions. The information that reached Europe at the time related entirely to the development of trade. The leading geographical journals pub- lished letters and articles written by the European residents of Khartoum, and travelers who visited the area depended on support from the traders. But the most important information came from the northern Sudanese employees of the trading companies, who pen- etrated new regions every year. For the Muslim population of Khartoum and the Nile valley, the existence of the "Niam-Niam" seems to have been unquestioned right from the outset. Ferdinand Werne, who took part in the second Egyptian Nile expedition, gives us an insight into how the "Niam-Niam" topos was spread and "con- "-Gray, History, 48.</page><page sequence="14">102 Paola Ivanov firmed" in the newly "discovered" country through mutual exchanges of information between the local people and the newcomers and due to many a misunderstanding. The Bari rainmaker Lagonu, with whom the members of the expedition had entered into a close rela- tionship, asked them to accompany him on a raid against unnamed hostile neighbors; they were said to be very savage fellows and were clearly "Niam-Niam," even if the term itself was not used: The man-eaters living in these mountains, but not known here as Njam-Njam, had been a subject of conversation among the crew for a long time. As we . . . heard, these ill-reputed mountain dwellers had heads like dogs and went about on all fours ... When we were still in Chartum, Captain Selim [a member of the expedition] had been extremely afraid of these so-called Njam-Njam; but now his ter- ror increased as if he were a child, because he . . . had the fattest belly. He already saw himself as nothing other than the first roast .... Before the first expedition, my brother called him a good fat roast ... for the man-eaters, and he was called only by this epithet when he fearfully inquired again and again about their existence and where they lived.... On closer questioning Ltkono explained the ominous talk about man-eating dogheads, and corrected us, saying that these evil people had heads like everyone else, but kept all their teeth and crawled on all fours when they ate humans.34 Thus the Bari attributed characteristics showing absence of civiliza- tion, such as keeping the front teeth, to the enemies against whom the powerful newcomers were to take action. (Among the Bari it was cus- tomary for boys and girls to have their four lower incisors knocked out when they reached puberty.) They might also have considered cannibalism a characteristic of enemies whom they feared or consid- ered to be of low standing; it is also possible that they simply wanted to fulfil the expectations of the newcomers. Werne's attempt to put the matter into perspective was in any case of no great use; the Niam- Niam or "dog people" of the upper Nile not only continued to be a subject of discussion in Khartoum, but soon became a topic of great interest in Europe.3s The debate there on the tailed Niam-Niam is based on the claims of a certain Louis du Couret alias "Hadji Abd-el-Hamid Bey," who allegedly traveled through Arabia, Abyssinia, Egypt, and the Sudan for over ten years. Between 1848 and 1854 he wrote several papers "4Ferdinand Werne, Expedition zur Entdeckung der Quellen des Weiflen Nil (1840-1841) (Berlin, 1848), 324-26. 3STheodor von Heuglin, Reise in das Gebiet des Weissen Nil und seiner westlichen Zufliisse in den Jabren 1862-1864 (Leipzig, 1869), 206.</page><page sequence="15">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 103 for scholarly societies, as well as other essays, by which he hoped to prove the existence of cannibalistic and tailed "Niam-Niam" in the still unknown upper reaches of the Nile. In other writings (signifi- cantly enough, most of them published by the novelist Alexandre Dumas pare, or maybe even written by him) he also wrote about the Mountains of the Moon, unicorns, and polygamous Christians in Dar Fur.36 Couret's person and his tales were scarcely credible even at that time, yet witnesses kept coming forward to claim they could confirm the existence of "Niam-Niam" as tailed and cannibalistic people in the unknown African interior. The question whether they really ex- isted was discussed by scholars and treated in geographical journals until around the end of the 1850s. The homo caudatus was also well known in Europe. He belongs to that series of fabulous creatures and half-human compound beings which includes, for example, the equally cannibalistic cynocephali (dog-headed men), the men with long ears or the headless men with their faces on their chests, who in classical antiquity were situated at the edge of the world and who kept turning up well into the eigh- teenth century in popular, real or fictive, travel accounts and scholarly compilations as the inhabitants of far-off, half-mythical regions.37 Ever since Marco Polo and increasingly in the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries, the homo caudatus motif was especially associated with the islands of southeast Asia.38 But it was also used with refer- ence to America (by Antonio Pigafetta, for example).39 Tailed people also appeared sporadically in reports on Africa before the nineteenth century (sometimes as tailed "dog people" or "dogheads").40 In the case of the tailed central African "Niam-Niam," people believed that the reports they received came from the local people or from infor- mants who knew the local people. But in reality, in accepting these re- ports they were mainly accepting Arab ideas and traditions, which to a large extent were based in their turn on classical knowledge, and 36On Couret and his publications see Richard Hill, "Louis Du Couret," French Studies 9(1955), 143-53; and Penel, Homo Caudatus, 145. 37Cf.

Anyone who had ever traveled in North Africa or the Orient felt themselves called on to contribute to the discussion. Information was collected in the North African coastal towns and in Cairo, even from "Sudanic" slaves in Bahia in Brazil, and from "central Africans" in Paris who are not more closely identified. There were even doctors living in big towns in the Orient who claimed to have treated African slaves who had tails. Although the debate was theoretically concerned with tailed people in the region of the upper Nile, rumors from Ethiopia, where stories circulated of people with tails and dog-like people (but not with the name "Niam-Niam"), became mixed in the discussions with the obviously North African tradition of the Yem-Yem or Yam-Yam south of the Sokoto caliphate or of Bornu, as well as with the Egyp- tian and northern Sudanese tradition of the Niam-Niam south of Wadai and Dar Fur (whether or not the term was associated with the idea of tailed creatures), and also with the "dog people" on the Bahr al-Jabal reported by the members of the Egyptian Nile expedition.42 That there was no agreement over the shapes or the name or the loca- tion of the creatures that were subject to so much speculation, seemed to be of no consequence to those participating in the discussion. 41Among the fantastic creatures that figured in the reports of the northern Sudanese were people with eyes in their armpits, who had to raise their arms to be able to see; dwarves with huge ears reaching to the ground, so that when they lay down to sleep they could lie on one ear and cover themselves with the other- these are the classical "men with long ears" mixed up with the pygmies; and not only dog-headed but also monkey-faced people with "tails a yard long." See John Petherick, Egypt, the Soudan and Central Africa: With Explorations from Khartoum on the White Nile to the Regions of the Equator (Edinburgh, 1861). Although Petherick attributes these details to a much-traveled old Dinka man, Gray (Histor)y, 58-59) shows that Petherick could not have undertaken this jour- ney himself, so that all this most probably came from tales told by his employees.

This topos was also taken up in theoretical discus- sions on comparative anatomy, completing the circle back to western tradition. For the homo caudatus, together with other half-human monsters found in early travel literaure, had stimulated discussions by natural historians and philosophers until around the middle of the eighteenth century. These composite figures were seen as the missing link between the animal and human kingdoms in the "great chain of being," that divine plan of creation which was internally harmonious, without gaps, and continuously graduated, as had been shown for in- stance in Carl von Linne's classification of species in the first half of the eighteenth century.43 Once it was firmly established, the discussion concerning tailed Niam-Niam influenced subsequent exploration of the upper Nile re- gion. Hardly a report was received which did not bring fresh news of their cannibalism and/or their having tails, and this is how the term came to be applied to the Azande, with whom the northern Sudanese established in the Bahr al-Ghazal and on the Bahr al-Jabal had trad- ing links after 1858. Relying on their reports, European travelers, missionaries, and residents of Khartoum also supplied information on the Avungara Azande under the heading "Niam-Niam," in which characteristic features of their culture (such as their centralized goverment or their weapons) and the names of rulers are recogniz- able, alongside all kinds of fantastic elements. However, these descrip- tions still focused on their cannibalism, which was very precisely de- scribed in contrast to the vagueness of the other details.44 In addition, other groups were also given the name "Niam-Niam," and it is possible to see how the name shifted in the wake of advanc- ing knowledge of the region. Thus the term was applied-apart from the Banda already known from Dar Fur, who for a long time were still considered to be part of the "Niam-Niam4S--to a series of small "41Joachim Herrmann and Herbert Ullrich, Menschwerdung: Eine Gesamtdar- stellung (Berlin, 1991), 531; Roger Lewin, Spuren der Menschwerdung: Die Evo- lution des Homo sapiens (Heidelberg, 1992), 13.

While the first Europeans to travel as far as the Bari heard nothing about the Niam-Niam (although many did try to obtain geographical and ethnographical information), Morlang, a resident missionary who lived from 1856 to 1860 in the Gondokoro mission station (near present-day Juba) believed after a few years of intense trading contacts that "Niam-Niam" was a Bari name for cannibals.49 When the traders advanced as far as the Moru Gazal zum Lande der Djur, Dezember 1860 und Januar 1861" in August Petermann and Bruno Hassenstein, eds., Innerafrika nach dem Stande der geograpbischen Kenntniss in den Jabren 1861 bis 1863, Nach den Quellen bearbeitet von A.

Many Europeans repeated the information on the basis of tales by zara'ib employees, which in turn seem partly to come from the Moru. In this ethnically very mixed area (later known as mudiriyya Makaraka, "Makaraka district"), the "Makaraka" were mainly iden- tified with the Adio, the easternmost group of Zande speakers, who were not under the domination of the Avungara.51 The Arabic origin of the "Niam-Niam" concept had by now been forgotten. The ety- mology of the word "Niam-Niam" was henceforth sought in the lan- guage of the Bari or of their Dinka neighbors,s2 until it became com- monly accepted that "Niam-Niam" (derived from Dinka cham, "to eat") was a Dinka word meaning "glutton."s53 For the nineteenth-century traders as well as European travelers and the geographers who processed their reports then, just as for the Arab geographers of the Middle Ages, the Niam-Niam were on the Centrale.

With the establishment in the 1860s of the zara'ib among the small peoples who were also ini- tially called "Niam-Niam," the equation "Niam-Niam" = Azande be- came increasingly accepted, until it was finally firmly established by the most famous of the upper Nile travelers, Georg Schweinfurth, who dismissed the vague ideas of the northern Sudanese regarding the localization of the fabulous Niam-Niam because they did not fit into his scientific categories.ss VI Looking back on the Niam-Niam debate of the nineteenth century and its projection onto the Azande, we can clearly see how, in its characteristic acceptance and combination of all possible traditions and rumors, however absurd they might be, perception of things and events is strongly influenced, even in (more or less serious) scientific discourse, by a pre-existing body of knowledge. This corpus of tradi- tions, frequently highly stereotyped, belongs to the collective memory of a culture, and so its components repeatedly turn up, without their truth being in any way substantiated through reproduction by differ- ent sources.s6 In particular the idea of cannibalism as part of the cor- pus of motifs associated with "barbarism/animality" (and thus with the areas outside one's own "civilization") has a fixed stock of images and cliches; that these were repeated with reference to different times and different places was never thought of as plagiarism but as evi- dence of the consistency of the information.s7 In a case like that of central Africa, regarding which hardly any 54It is striking that as soon as the traders had developed a closer relationship to the northwestern Azande of Mukpoi's principality, they also introduced a specific name for it, "Dar Dika" (derived from the name for the Azande used by Ndogo- Sere speakers): Heuglin, Reise, 207, 210.

On this basis, for example, the German geographer Carl Ritter, in accordance with T. E. Bowdich's speculations on the in- terior of the continent, had as early as around 1820 supported the theory of the existence of "Yam-Yam" cannibals in the whole of the northern part of central Africa: But the lum-lums (Yem-Yem) and other Ethiopians of the interior, stretch from the interior of the Gaboon river in a northeasterly direc- tion towards old Ethiopia, i.e. as far as the upper Nile, and are the savage Ethiopians of Herodotus, the cannibals of Ptolomy, who still have the same old habits and live in the same places as in those times.58 The psychological climate might also have contributed to the fact that the existence of tailed people appeared to a broad public to be credible, or at least worthy of discussion. In those days of awakening scientific interest in exploring unknown regions, new "discoveries" were made very rapidly, especially in the areas of geography and com- parative anatomy. Suddenly many things appeared to confirm the leg- endary traditions of antiquity, such as the first reports of snow-cov- ered mountains at the equator and of the equatorial lakes, of anthropomorphous monkeys (without tails), or of very small people. The example of the Niam-Niam also allows us to observe how im- ages and clich6s from other societies are taken up and adapted to ex- isting discourse without any knowledge of their background. In those days it was recognized scientific practice to inquire among slaves, slave traders, and pilgrims in the towns of North Africa and the Ori- ent about the unknown regions of the Sudanic kingdoms and their border areas. The North African slave markets appear to have been an especially popular place for passing on tales about tailed canni- bals.59 What most interested the merchants and the buyers was not so ssCarl Ritter, Die Erdkunde im Verhiiltnis zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen, oder allgemeine, vergleichende Geographie. 1.

For example, bloodshot eyes and blackened gums were considered to be the sign of a cruel nature; a slave who gnashed his teeth in his sleep could even be returned to the merchant, since it was believed that he would never submit to his master; a slave's place of origin was also considered to be a "quality crite- rion."62 As far as the upper Nile region in particular is concerned, it is sometimes thought that the reason why traders spread stories about the Niam-Niam was to promote their own commercial interests.63 There is evidence for the use of horror stories as a deterrent for poten- tial competition in other parts of Africa.64 In the southern Sudan there was conflict between Muslim merchants from Khartoum and Dar Fur who were heavily involved in the slave trade, and Europeans who (when they did not participate in it themselves) were exerting pressure on the Turco-Egyptian government to stop the slave trade.6s It is therefore not impossible that the northern Sudanese traders tried to prevent European interference by spreading stories about the Niam-Niam, although such an intention cannot be proved.

Reli- giously motivated disparagement of the unbelievers also served to le- gitimate their enslavement, which could be understood as a form of integration into the Muslim community and thus as a transition from their "savage" animal-like state to a "civilized" one. Absence of clothing and cannibalism were fixed elements of the value judgment involved in the opposition of paganism and Islamic civilization."6 This is clearly shown in a Fur song from the end of the nineteenth century about the "Fartit" in the south: The people who live in Fartit (pirti) are slaves and (yet) go free. // They know nothing at all, neither good nor evil. // These heathens who eat men, are barbarians and go around naked. // They cover their behinds with leaves; of clothes they know nothing. Or else they run around like cattle. // We Fur go and bring them among us and teach them our Islam; // And they live happily among us.67 In another Fur text from the same period, the cannibals are explic- itly referred to as "Niam-Niam" (N'amnama) who live in a faraway country where there are no graves, for "their only grave is their belly" (another recurring motif in accounts of anthropophagy from the re- gion, appearing for example in descriptions of the Azande).68 Thus, apart from concrete commercial interests, the "cannibals" or "Niam Niam" were simply a category of despised "slave peoples" for the Muslim traders from Khartoum or Dar Fur. As in past centuries, the attribution of cannibalism, or the use of the term Niam-Niam, was based mainly on ideological tendencies. It was also easy to spread or confirm the Niam-Niam or cannibal- ism motif through interaction between the local people and strangers, as we have seen in the example of the dog-headed Bari neighbors. As far as the Azande are concerned, several groups with whom the trad- ""John Ralph Willis, "Introduction: The Ideology of Enslavement in Islam" in idem, ed., Slaves and Slavery in Muslim Africa, 1, Islam aind the Ideology of En- slavement (London, 1985), 1-15; specifically on the ideology of enslavement in Dar Fur see O'Fahey, "Fur and Fartit," 77-78, 83. 67Ernst Zyhlarz, "Eine Auslese aus Max Miiller's Kondjara-Werk," Zeitschrift fiir Eingeborenen-Sprachen 32/3(1941/42), 177 (translated by O'Fahey, "Fur and Fartit," 78).

The question as to whether the attri- bution of cannibalism also came from the local people, or whether it was first introduced by the traders, can no longer be settled today. The eagerness of the Europeans to solve the Niam-Niam problem that was an established part of geographical research, contributed much to making the "Niam-Niam," and the question of whether they were cannibalistic or whether they had tails or dogs' heads, a much- debated topic in Khartoum and the upper Nile region, and thus helped to anchor the Niam-Niam topos more firmly. In a situation in which direct knowledge was almost completely lacking, the mutual influences between local population, traders, missionaries, travelers, and systematizing geography (as practiced not only by "armchair ge- ographers" but also by travelers, traders, etc., in their works) played a decisive role in the transmission of these topoi. Geographical journals had a demonstrable function here, articulating the progressive "dis- covery" of Africa more clearly than any single travel account. In addi- tion, all those who were involved kept up intense personal contacts. This certainly resulted in communication on the subject orally and through letters, and thus in the spread and establishment of the ste- reotypes.72 And this leads us to another related aspect: with the tailed, canni- balistic Niam-Niam, with or without the head or the shape of dogs, we are really dealing not with one, but with several interrelated topoi. These include on the one hand the motif of the cannibalistic Niam- Niam and that of cannibalistic tailed people (especially slaves) and on the other hand the equally cannibalistic dog-headed men (who ac- "90n the methods used by the Avungara to gain power over foreign peoples, cf.

These motifs are not joined into a single, fixed shape; there is a broad leeway both for variants and for innovations which find their confir- mation in their conformity to the basic corpus of traditions. The way different motifs were mixed can be observed not only in the tails of the Niam-Niam, but also through attempts to refute this topos. The most frequent argument against the existence of tailed Niam-Niam was that it was simply a mistake: because people wore animal skins with the tail still attached, or animal tails as a decorative part of their clothing, these had been mistaken for tails actually grow- ing on the people. This opinion was frequently repeated, especially in the sources of the 1850s and 1860s, and is occasionally still expressed today with regard to the notion of the Azande as tailed Niam-Niam. But since, at least in the area of the southern Sudan, the Niam-Niam conception was hardly connected with any identifiable people, it is not possible that any specific form of clothing was mistaken, and the localization of the peoples supposed to be decorated with an animal's tail is just as vague and unstable as that of the "Niam-Niam."76 This explanation is also much older than the idea of the tailed 73See al-Tunisi's account of the Banda above, and, among others: Ibn Sacid in Cuoq, Recueil, ? 352-54; d'Anania, Universale fabrica, 286; Aucapitaine.

The most widely accepted explanation is that given by Lejean, "La queue," but it refers to a form of clothing characteristic only of the Avukaya-Ojili, to the west of the Yei, whom the traders considered to be "Niambara" (="Niam-Niam"); cf.

The Niam-Niam debate shows that the analysis of stereotypes cannot be restricted to indi- vidual cases or areas; the rules of conventional critique of sources also fail here, since in the case of clich6s rooted in collective patterns of perception, there is not necessarily any direct dependency of one source on another. Rather the situation is similar to that of processes of oral tradition, where it is impossible to establish one source as be- ing independent of the others. VII In 1858 the Welsh trader John Petherick, who was later to become the British vice consul in Khartoum, and who became known mainly for his unsuccessful mission to the Bahr al-Jabal to support the Nile expe- dition of Speke and Grant (1863), claimed to have seen the "Niam- Niam" himself, among other places in a village called "Mundo."79 These Niam-Niam can be clearly identified as Avungara Azande on the basis of the descriptions given and the names of the rulers men- tioned; but it is doubtful whether Petherick himself really visited the Azande; he may have been merely repeating information culled from one of his wukala during an ivory-collecting tour, as most Europeans in those days believed.80 The form of Petherick's report speaks for the 77Joseph Franqois Lafitau, Customs of the American Indians Compared with the Customs of Primitive Times (Moeurs des sauvages amteriquains, comparees aux m~iurs des premiers temps) (2 vols.: Paris, 1724), ed. and trans. by William N.

Furthermore, the locations and the genealogy of the princes mentioned are imprecise and confused. All that can be said for sure is that the traders traveled from the country of the Belanda-Bor and the Bongo on both sides of the Sue to the most northerly princes of Yakpati's line and possibly also of Nunga's line (Anunga).8" Petherick's works do not give us more than a few details, which are difficult to interpret, regarding the first con- tacts between traders and Azande."2 However, contemporary maps showing Petherick's travels confused the "Mundo" mentioned by him (really the Bongo name for the Azande) with the area inhabited by the Mundu people to the west of the river Yei.83 Even today it is often er- roneously claimed that Petherick's information refers to the Azande Adio, neighbors of the Mundu, and that his collection-the first Azande objects of fairly certain origin-came from this group, which was not under the domination of the Avungara.84 Theodor von Heuglin's reports on the Azande are far more useful, although he, too, only collected information from traders and neigh- boring peoples-in 1862 in Khartoum and in 1863/64 in the course of a Bahr al-Ghazal expedition-which was overshadowed by several deaths, undertaken with the wealthy Dutch traveler, Harriet Tinne and her daughter Alexandrine. This expedition only reached the zara'ib of the traders Abu Amuri and al-Busayli (the modern Bisellia), located in an area inhabited by the western Bongo, to the west of the river Jur.ss However, the journey fell at a time when there was already intensive contact between the Azande and traders, and Heuglin ob- tained precise information, especially from the territory of Mukpoi (Anunga), much visited by the traders, situated to the west of the big slave markets (diyum) of the western Bahr al-Ghazal.

Thus Heuglin had already assembled a collection of "ethnographic objects from the negro lands west of the Bahr el Abiad" in Khartoum in 1862, before his journey, which is illustrated in a much reproduced plate (including one of the earliest known Azande harps).89 The ob- jects probably come partly from the western Bahr al-Ghazal, partly from the country of Mukpoi, and partly from that of the Azande Adio.90 In the 1860s the influence of the traders constantly increased, since the Turco-Egyptian government in the Sudan was too weak to inter- vene directly in the region of the upper Nile. They consolidated their position wherever they had established themselves, and extended the zara'ib system to the west and the south. While the western princes, and Mukpoi in particular, continued to maintain trade relations with the diyum of the western Bahr al-Ghazal, the traders had opened up several other trade routes by the mid-1860s at the latest, passing through the eastern territory of the Avungara of Yakpati's line, and in 1866/67 they finally reached the Mangbetu who lived in the south. The trade caravans also opened up the way into the interior of the Azande territory for the first Europeans.

The son of a miller from Badia di Cantignano near Lucca, Piaggia emigrated to North Africa in 1851. After working for a short time as a gardener in Tunis, he practiced various different crafts in Alexandria, and then moved to Khartoum in 1856.91 At first he worked for the traders as hunter and arms manufacturer in the region of the river Nacam and the Bahr al-Jabal. But the violence he experienced soon led him seek employment with travelers, including accompanying the Italian exile, Orazio Antinori (who later helped to found the Societa Geografica Italiana), on a hunting and collecting trip into the Bahr al-Ghazal as far as the river Jur (December 1860 - around June 1861).92 In 1863 Piaggia joined the annual ivory caravan of the Coptic mer- chant, Ghattas, which gave him an opportunity to visit the area in- habited by the Azande. In November 1863, together with his com- panions, he reached the court of Prince Tombo (son of Yakpati), be- tween the upper courses of the rivers Sue and Ibba, in the northeast of the Azande country. With the aim of gathering "natural history col- lections and other information,"93 he stayed with the Azande for over a year, remaining alone with them when the caravan set off on its re- turn journey. He mainly lived with Tombo, who welcomed Piaggia as a "friend" (badia) and gave him a house, but also visited areas be- longing to other rulers.94 Even after his journey, Piaggia, who had at best only a rudimentary education, was part neither of the academic nor of the early colonial community in the Turco-Egyptian service, and in his lifetime was able "For biographical details see Ezio Bassani, ed., Carlo Piaggia nella terra dei Niam-Niam (1863-1865) (Lucca, 1978), xiv-xxxvi. 92Antinori, "Reise vom Bahr el Gazal" and idem, "Viaggi," 93-103. Research usu- ally tends to neglect the fact that in addition to the famous travelers, most of whom came from socially privileged backgrounds, there were also a large number of European emigrants in Egypt at that time, especially Italians, with more lowly social origins. They included craftsmen, petty traders, hunters, and taxidermists who were employed by collectors and naturalists. For example, a collecting trip into western Azande country was undertaken in 1876-79 by Friedrich Bohndorff, a former goldsmith's apprentice (later employed as a taxidermist by Wilhelm Junker), reported by Georg Schweinfurth, ed., "F. Bohndorff's Reise nach Dar Abu Dinga," Das Ausland (1884), 541-45, and Bruno Hassenstein, "Friedrich Bohndorffs Reisen in Zentralafrika, 1874 bis 1883," Petermanns Mitteilungen 31(1885), 339-50.

At the suggestion of Georg Schweinfurth, Piaggia did write a re- port himself on his travels, but he was never able to publish it. Two different undated versions of these records are preserved in the state archive of Lucca and were published during the Italian fascist pe- riod.98 However, as the editor took the liberty of joining the two ver- sions into one and altering them according to his own judgment, this publication is not very reliable. In 1978 Ezio Bassani published in its original form what is probably the earlier version of the text, re- stricted to the part concerning the journey to the Azande and the time spent with them. Here the rather short factual report is presented, to- gether with extracts from the other version of the text, considered to be the later one on the basis of anecdotal and philosophical additions, as well as the original text of the lecture and another short account of a war waged by the Azande.99 Piaggia stands out in his time for his unprejudiced attitude toward Africans. Although he used the expression "selvaggio" ("savage"), he attached no value judgment to it, using it to mean simply an inhabit- ant of the "selva," or forest, and he saw no difference between the savage and the "uomo domestico" ("domestic man"): "the savage grows up in the forest as domestic man does in houses."'00 He re- jected the idea of Europeans having a civilizing mission, which for him would only result in rule by force, the enrichment of the Europe- ans, and in the end "barbarism," and therefore pled for gradual inte- gration into the "civilized" world. The circumstances in which he en- tered into relations with the Azande, which at that time were unique, at least for Europeans, render his reports particularly valuable. 9SApart from two long visits to Italy Piaggia spent the rest of his life in the Sudan, but never ranked among the highly esteemed and popular explorers. His travels included trips up the Blue Nile, the Bahr al-Jabal and the Victoria Nile, and to Ethiopia; he died in 1882 in Karkoj (Sinnar). 96Carlo Piaggia, Dell'arrivo fra i Niam-Niam e del soggiorno sul lago Tzana in Abissinia (Lucca, 1877). 97Antinori, "Viaggi." 98Alfonso Pellegrinetti, ed., Le memorie di Carlo Piaggia (Florence, 1941).

Although brief, his remarks give us a clear outline of the pyrami- dal power structure, the system of tribute payments to the princes and redistribution of natural produce through hospitality at court, and the legal function of the oracle. He described the organization of the court and courtly behavior, and also touched on the field of ideology, stressing the importance in Azande society of individual success in hunting and war, as well as of luck and personal skill. Piaggia's practi- cal nature is reflected in his precise descriptions of daily tasks, par- ticularly in connection with the procurement and preparation of food. Of great importance are Piaggia's many comments, perfectly credible in view of his position at court, on the importance of possessing many wives as an instrument of power for the Avungara princes, and on their role as givers of wives for the purpose of forming alliances and pacts with traders or other rulers and of gaining clients-facts which Evans-Pritchard virtually ignored due to the introduction of standard- ized bride price regulations during the colonial period.'02 Piaggia's sensitive accounts, free from any derogatory undertones, and his vivid descriptions of persons and landscapes (he is the origina- tor, for instance, of the term "gallery forest," which was adopted by Schweinfurth as a general botanical term) further enhance the value of his reports.

Most importantly, the routes and dates mentioned do not always agree. Even the total length of his stay is uncertain: ac- cording to Antinori's report it was about fifteen months, but twenty according to the first version of his own account of his travels.104 Of particular consequence is the question of whether Ghattas' ivory caravan left the Azande country again shortly after its arrival at Tombo's court (as in the second version of his travel account and in the lecture) or whether Piaggia undertook some of his trips to the south in the company of the ivory traders (as in Antinori's report and the first version). In his reconstruction of the history of the principal- ity of Gbudwe (Yakpati's line), Evans-Pritchard stated, on the basis of Piaggia's reports, that before 1865 no traders had penetrated the area south of Tombo's territories, which at that time belonged to the pow- erful Prince Bazingbi, Gbudwe's father and Tombo's brother. For this reason the first confrontation with the traders recounted by Gbudwe's subjects should be dated after 1865 (contrary to Piaggia's report of a fierce fight in 1862).s05 Evans-Pritchard here followed the account of the journey given by Piaggia in his lecture, which was calculated for effect, and in which he claimed that the shock of the traders on meet- ing Tombo was so great that they left Piaggia alone among the terrify- ing cannibals.'06 Evans-Pritchard wrote: "There is nothing in Antinori's record to suggest that Ghattas' company, or any other, had as yet penetrated to Bazingbi's country; on the contrary, the evidence implicit in it makes this seem highly improbable."'17 He did not seem to notice that Antinori expressly said that Piaggia left Tombo's court "together with the escort" (scorta). Antinori used this term to refer to Ghattas' ninety-five men, who, together with two hundred porters, formed the ivory expedition to the Azande.108 According to Antinori and the first version of Piaggia's own account, Piaggia and the traders traveled southward on a tour lasting several months, which took them into Bazingbi's territory and, although not to the prince himself, at least to t03Cf.

Moreover, Piaggia's writings underline in many episodes that in the years 1864/65 the exchange between the traders and the princes of the house of Yakpati was already well advanced, and that in addition to Ghattas' representatives, other trading companies were present. For example, there were men from the company of de Malzac (which in Piaggia's time belonged to Binder, and later to Tuhami), which was notorious for its participation in the slave trade, and that went from Rumbek near the river Nacam into the territory of Bazingbi's son Malingindo. Petherick's wakil Abu Qurun reached the territory of the Mangbetu on the right bank of the Uele as early as 1866, while another unidentified company (possibly that of Schweinfurth's later guide Muhammad cAbd al-Samad) already owned a zariba in the territory of a certain Prince "Imberi," near the river Ibba, probably meaning Mbeli, the son of Muduba, who was under the control of his brother Ngangi.l12 Like all others before and after him, Evans-Pritchard was taken in by the stereotype of the Azande as proud defenders of their "independence," a topic which we shall consider again. Piaggia was clearly mistaken about the descent of several rulers, even though he claimed to have visited some of them, and some princes named by him are not mentioned by anyone else.113 In view of the many contradictions between the different writings regarding the 1"9There are discrepancies both in the route and in the duration of the stay of the traders (a little over five months according to Antinori, a little over two in Piaggia's travel account). Evans-Pritchard only had Pellegrinetti's edited text at his disposal, which adopted the chronology of the second version, but the publisher does give a summary of the contents of the first version.

Georg Schweinfurth doubted that Piaggia reached the territory of the great Prince Kipa (Arabic "Kifa"), Ndeni's son.114 Piaggia referred to this most powerful ruler of the Azande in the area south of the Uele as a "small independent chief" and declared him to be the son of a non-existent queen "Inguria," possibly due to a wrong interpretation of Kipa's epithet Ngura. The first version of his travel account seems the most credible, claiming that Piaggia only reached the neighboring northern territories and had to return because of a threatened war.t1s Kipa did attempt to invade the countries north of the Uele, which could have coincided with Piaggia's journey.116 If Piaggia really reached his main territories to the south, he would not have left unmentioned the great river which he would have had to cross, especially in view of the fact that the Eu- ropeans in Khartoum were eager for news of its western course. In those cases where Piaggia's information is not confirmed by sub- sequent sources, the problem arises of to what extent he should be be- lieved. Moreover, although he was the only traveler who learned to speak Zande, his linguistic competence was certainly not very great, as can be seen from the way he distorted some terms beyond recogni- tion. Particularly serious is the fact that he failed to recognize the eth- nic heterogeneity of the Azande cluster, and therefore used only the general term "Niam-Niam," although Tombo's territories were inhab- ited by Bantu-speaking Buguru who had only recently been inte- grated, and there were Barambu, and probably also Amadi (both Ubangi-speaking groups), in the other areas he visited.'17 Piaggia's observations were practically ignored in most historical works on the Azande, while Evans-Pritchard frequently rejected his statements without giving any reason when they did not seem to fit his own re- constructions. Yet Piaggia knew the Azande so well that, since Bassani's edition at the latest, valuable information can be taken from his work, if appropriate critical methods are applied, and any dis- missal of his claims must be carefully considered in every case. In his report to Antinori Piaggia rejected current notions about the cannibalism of the "Niam-Niam:" "[s]ome of their customs are cruel, but they are not man-eaters.""1 In only one place in his report did he 114Schweinfurth, Inm Herzen, 318, 323.

There is no point in discussing in detail the question of the "evi- dence" provided by various travelers for the cannibalism of the Azande, since most instances have already been convincingly refuted by Evans-Pritchard.121 But the striking point about Piaggia is that in the notes for his travel account he suddenly reports several examples of cannibalism among the Azande, and also-as is clear from the comparison between the first and the second version-the more des- perate he became in his search for a publisher, the more eager he was to add vivid details to his account.122 In the mind of the public at that time, including the scholarly public, cannibalism among the Azande was already accepted as a fact, owing the work of Georg Schwein- furth, whose much-praised travel report Im Herzen von Afrika (1874) obviously served as a model for Piaggia's literary efforts. VIII While in public opinion Piaggia belonged to the "uneducated classes,"'23 the young and ambitious botanist Georg Schweinfurth matched the ideal image of the well-bred and highly educated African 119Ibid., 124.

In other ways too Piaggia showed a greater tendency toward sensationalism in the later accounts of his experiences. Especially in the lecture and in the second version of his travel account he showed a prefer- ence for spicy stories and makes unlikely claims about his own role among the Azande.

In Ber- lin, where the core of the small community of German explorers gath- ered, interconnected through a network of personal relations, he met some of the most renowned African explorers of his time, including Heinrich Barth, who introduced him into the Berlin Geographical So- ciety, and the travelers to northeast Africa, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, Alfred Edmund Brehm (famous in Germany as the author of popular books on zoology), and Robert Hartmann, an anatomist, who later, together with Adolf Bastian and the physician Rudolf Virchow, was among the most important figures in the institutional- ization of German ethnology. Immediately after completing his doctoral thesis on Hartmann's plant collection from the region of the upper Nile (1862), Schweinfurth undertook a botanical expedition, mainly financed from private sources, along the Red Sea coast as far as the Abyssinian bor- der (1863-66). This experience, and the fact that he was well known in scientific circles, enabled him to carry out his crucial journey into the "heart of Africa," an expedition financed mainly by the Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation of the Prussian Acadamy of Sciences and followed with great interest by the academic world. After his arrival in Khartoum in November 1868, Schweinfurth joined Ghattas' trading company, which traveled into the zara'ib area of the Bahr al-Ghazal. A firman from the Governor-General of the Sudan granted him safe conduct in all areas opened up by the traders. By generously inviting him to join his caravan to the south free of charge, another trader, Muhammad cAbd al-Samad, helped Schweinfurth to his great achievements (he was later awarded a Ger- man Distinguished Service medal following recommendations by Schweinfurth and the Academy of Sciences). Schweinfurth visited the "Niam-Niam" (Azande), was the first European to cross the Nile- Congo watershed, and reached the first large river of the Congo river system, the Uele, and the Mangbetu ("Monbuttu") people to the south. He was thus able to confirm claims by the traders, which had 124For biographical details, see the obituary by W.

Schweinfurth was a good observer. Due to his scientific training he was able to report on his experiences and present the data he collected in a systematic way, and he was stylistically gifted. His travel report Im Herzen von Afrika is the first detailed description of the regions west of the Bahr al-Jabal and represented at the time a huge advance in geographical and ethnographic knowledge.127 It is a consistent work, in both the scientific and the literary senses, which became an international bestseller, and founded Schweinfurth's reputation and influence in scientific circles. After this great journey, Schweinfurth, who enjoyed a long life, continued to travel and to devote himself to research in a broad range of fields in Egypt, Eritrea, and Yemen. He was a member of many scientific societies and was also active in the German colonial movement.128 As one of the most reputed German scientists, he became the undisputed authority on central Africa for generations of researchers. Indeed, even today his work is an indis- pensable source of information on the Bahr al-Ghazal region and the Nile-Congo watershed in the nineteenth century. This long-term influ- ence is all the more grave in view of the fact that Schweinfurth's eth- nographical observations are not as sound as was long supposed. The conditions under which Schweinfurth traveled, particularly on his journey through the Azande area to the Mangbetu, offered him 12SCf. among others Lejean "Les Nyamnyam," 6; Antinori, "Viaggi," 113; Leopoldo Ori, "Comunicazioni del Dott.

He was almost ninety years old when he died in 1925.</page><page sequence="40">128 Paola Ivanov only very limited opportunities for contact with the local people. Ac- companied by four servants from Khartoum and three interpreters from the south ("my three interpreter slaves"), including "two genu- ine Niamniam," he was tied to the huge caravan of cAbd al-Samad, which at times consisted of up as many as 800 people.'29 Like Piaggia's, his route passed through territories belonging to princes of Yakpati's line, but further to the east, and in some parts right on the eastern periphery of the Azande expansion area. It crossed the territo- ries of Princes Ngangi (son of Muduba) and Wando (son of Bazingbi). Between these was a territory, which cAbd al-Samad, together with his ally, Mbagali (also a son of Muduba), had conquered from Gbate, a prince descended from Yakpati's first-born son Renzi, and which was ruled by Mbagali. Altogether the journey lasted about five months, including three weeks spent with the Mangbetu king, Mbunza, and about six weeks in the territory of Mbagali. The caravan spread un- rest wherever it went-once it was even attacked-and during the short stops, Schweinfurth, who as a botanist was chiefly interested in plants, was scarcely able to enter into relations with the people. Al- though the members of the caravan were usually received at the courts of princes and subordinate territorial rulers, the friendly, Ara- bic-speaking Prince Mbagali (called Surur by the traders) seems to have been the only Avungara with whom Schweinfurth had a close re- lationship. In the course of long botanical excursions in his territory, he had an opportunity to become superficially acquainted with the lo- cal population.130 In a letter to the geographical journal Petermanns Mitteilungen written after his return to the Bahr al-Ghazal, Schweinfurth admitted that he had not yet had sufficient opportunity to collect information about the Azande.13' A second journey to them was planned, follow- ing Piaggia's route, but it was called off because of disturbances that broke out between some of the princes and the traders. It can be as- sumed that, besides the northern Sudanese members of the caravan, the two interpreters who accompanied him from the Bahr al-Ghazal, were a major source of information about the Azande. Schweinfurth probably owed them the useful Azande vocabulary that he compiled '29Schweinfurth, Im Herzen, 174-75, 184, 218-19; at the beginning of the journey he mentioned being accompanied by two slave girls, who served "as living mills:" ibid., 23. 130lbid., 242-45. 131"Dr. G.

One of them, probably the younger one, Amber, was given to Schweinfurth by cAbd al-Samad "as a gift."'33 Evans-Pritchard also expressed doubts about Schweinfurth's knowledge of Arabic at the time of the expedition, but without furnishing any evidence.134 Yet it is quite likely that Schweinfurth had enough opportunities to learn Arabic on his first journey. The value of Schweinfurth's report as a historical source is addi- tionally limited by the fact that in December 1870, after his return to the Bahr al-Ghazal, all his travel notes were destroyed in a fire. He was able to save only his botanical collection, his drawings, and the vocabulary of the Bongo language.135 The frequent argument of mod- ern critics that Schweinfurth therefore had to reconstruct all events from memory, however, is not quite justified.'36 Following a custom practiced by many travelers, he had regularly sent letters and interim reports to Europe (together with information concerning his route 132Georg Schweinfurth, Linguistische Ergebnisse einer Reise nach Centralafrika (Berlin, 1873), 36-53; on the genesis of the vocabulary, cf. Imhn Herzen, 455. Most of the words he gave are right, if one discounts his attempts at reproducing them phonetically, where errors occurred, which Evans-Pritchard pointed out: "Sources, with Particular Reference to the Southern Sudan," Cahiers d'dtudes africaines 41(1971), 138-39. The example given by Evans-Pritchard, in which he claims that Schweinfurth had understood the name given to him by the Azande, 'leaf-eater,' wrongly as Mbarik-pah instead of barikpe, is due to a misleading spelling in the English edition. In the vocabulary the word "leaf" is given correctly as pb; in the German edition of the travel account this is rendered with a popularized spelling as Mbarik-piib. 133Schweinfurth, Im Herzen, 174. When the expedition ended, Jabir remained in the Bahr al-Ghazal, after Schweinfurth had "secured his freedom."

This journal published five short reports by Schwein- furth, in part with the respective maps, based on letters written before the loss of his records (apart from the reports already mentioned: "I.

Schweinfurth's observations from this period appeared in journal form, with maps and itineraries, in the Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fuir Erdkunde zu Ber- lin. As the date of writing is not given, it remains unclear whether these are ex- tracts from the journal that was destroyed in the fire. "Tagebuch einer Reise zu den Niam-Niam und Monbuttu 1870," Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fiir Erdkunde zu Berlin 7(1872), 385-475, is a particular problem: it was published only in 1872, after Schweinfurth's return from Africa and could therefore have been writ- ten in retrospect. Complete references for other letters and especially botanical re- ports sent from Africa can be found in the bibliography of Schweinfurth's writings in the third edition of his travel account, published in 1918. 141Essner, Deutsche Afrikareisende, 112. The young Bongo slave who was pre- sented to Schweinfurth as a gift seems to have accompanied him during the whole expedition. Unfortunately, Allagabo did not have a "kind fate" in the "places of culture," as Schweinfurth prophesied he would: entrusted by Schweinfurth to the explorer Gerhard Rohlfs, who was married to his niece, he ended up as the "wild man" in a circus, after a number of failed attempts at gaining an education, and he finally died of pneumonia.

Schweinfurth's scant knowledge of the peoples he visited and the loss of his notes which could not be completely compensated for, led to a number of ethnographic errors and weaknesses in his account, on which Evans-Pritchard remarked. As far as the Azande are concerned, especially his descriptions of religion and witchcraft (including the function of oracles), and in part also of the political organization, are either incomplete or inaccurate. Evans-Pritchard even commented on some carelessness in his treatment of the material culture of various groups. Thus Schweinfurth did not mention the articificial deforma- tion of the skull common among the Mangbetu, which Wilhelm Junker reported on soon after, and he considered the bow and arrow to be the main weapon of the Nuer although, according to Evans- Pritchard, they were never used by this people.142 In these last ex- amples, cultural changes cannot be absolutely excluded, but it is a striking fact that Schweinfurth had recourse to other sources wher- ever he lacked information (his comments on the role of bows and ar- rows among the Nuer, for instance, are taken from E Werne's Expedi- tion zur Entdeckung der Quellen des Weiflen Nil), and in respect of the Azande he mainly had recourse to Piaggia, and possibly to other authors.143 A source of error which has attracted less attention is Schweinfurth's ideologically-colored perspective, which he used to dis- guise his lack of knowledge about the local peoples. This is partly connected with the aims of his book and his intended audience. Schweinfurth was the first German explorer to compose his account specifically for a broad public, and he therefore attached special importanace to the narrative aspect. He kept his scientific reports, es- pecially in his own field of botany, for publication in specialist jour- nals. With this double solution he hoped to secure for himself both fi- nancial success and recognition in the academic world.144 However, 142Evans-Pritchard, "Zande Cannibalism," 139-40; idem., "Sources," 135-40. Evans-Pritchard also criticized Schweinfurth for not noticing that among the Azande alone, of all the peoples he visited, pottery was a craft practiced by men and not women. However, this is a problematical criticism, for female potters are mentioned by witnesses who knew the Azande well: P. M. Larken, "Impressions of the Azande," Sudan Notes and Records 10(1927), 129; C.-R.

The first edition of his book appeared in</page><page sequence="44">132 Paola Ivanov Schweinfurth's desire to fulfill the expectations of a broad audience did not lead him into the trap of superficial sensationalism.14s The at- traction of his book is due not least to the fact that he succeeded in enlivening the fundamental European tropes about Africa on a high level, taking into account the relevant literature of the period. As a naturalist Schweinfurth was a convinced Darwinist and did not hesitate to transfer evolutionist ideas to peoples and cultures. He often reveals an unreflected feeling of superiority, seeing himself as a herald of civilization, and his good-natured paternalistic tone some- times becomes clearly disparaging.'46 Colonial fantasies, which were to become a decisive element in later travel reports, also appear in his work, even if only to a small degree.147 However, these attitudes are not as influential for Schweinfurth's text strategy as the other side of the middle-class, positivist, and evolutionist feeling of superiority-a romantic worship of nature, which was maily rooted in aesthetic plea- sure. Schweinfurth referred to himself as an "enthusiast of nature and the wilderness"'48 and fills his travel report with romanticizing de- scriptions of landscapes, underlining their "pure godly nature"149 and paradisiacal wildness. As Pratt has demonstrated for Victorian travel reports, descriptions are influenced by conventions of picturesque landscape representation.'s0 Even scientific research "in the holy temple of nature" is for Schweinfurth emotionally loaded and repre- sents an experiential space:1s1 1873 in an English translation by Ellen E. Frewer because better conditions were offered. 14SThis seems to be Essner's opinion: "Some Aspects," 203. t46As a European, i.e., "as a being of the superior kind" (Ibn Herzen, 244), Schweinfurth continually strove to set himself apart from the "Negroes" and the "Nubian rabble" (ibid., 183). Derogatory remarks are common, for instance con- cerning the northern Sudanese traders and soldiers, who were his companions for many months (e.g., ibid., 55, 456-60). Schweinfurth's description of the pygmies (ibid., 358-61), not far removed from a description of anthropomorphic monkeys, also influenced the way they were perceived by subsequent observers. 147With "free commerce" as a slogan, he, like most of his contemporaries, favored European intervention in Africa (cf. ibid., 511-12).

The "eternal as- pects of human nature" appear as an ambivalent and attractive mix- ture of savage cruelty (cannibalism) and, measured by the criteria of the time, a "high" standard in the political and artistic fields (central power, striking national character, refined material culture), a mixture that both reflected and stimulated European consciousness.15s6 His ref- erences to Antiquity and to echoes of the heroic age-"at that time the whole pattern of my life was Odyssean"'57-together with the IS2Ibid., 2.

But there</page><page sequence="46">134 Paola Ivanov stylized image of the traveler as a hero, all went to make a picture of "barbarism" that fit well into the worldview of the educated middle classes of the time.158 The romanticization of nature and the picturesque manner of per- ception are perfectly reflected in the artistically excellent illustrations, most of which were based on sketches made in Africa by Schweinfurth himself. Characteristically, they were designed by him as "an embellishment to encourage the sale of the work."159 In accor- dance with his text strategy, the people and their settlements were pre- sented as components of a luxuriant and idyllic natural scenario, which was the object of imperialistic greed. Schweinfurth also as- sembled his drawings of the artifacts, house forms, etc., of the peoples he visited, with descriptions in both German and English, in his book entitled Artes Africanae: Illustrations and Descriptions of Productions of the Industrial Arts of Central African Tribes.'60 While the draw- ings certainly show a remarkable sense of form and function, and constitute a valuable documentation, they again reveal Schweinfurth's strong tendency to estheticism. They reflect his stereotype of an angeborener Kunsttrieb (innate instinct for art), which is "best pre- served" among the "most secluded" and thus "the rudest tribes, who are partly still addicted to cannibalism, aye, in the very heart of Af- rica."161 The expression angeborener Kunsttrieb (in the original English text insufficiently rendered as "indigenous mechanical instinct") shows that Schweinfurth's marked admiration of craft products, in particular among the Mangbetu (he never speaks of art in the sense of "high art" but only of Kunst- und Gewerbefleifl, industrial arts and handi- crafts) should not be seen as a first step toward appreciation of Afri- is also no lack of allusions to those "classical" barbarians, the Scythians, and to Herodotus' description (ibid., 299, 380).

Just as with regard to "primitive" handicrafts, people underlined the ad- equateness of artistic design, materials, and techniques in this "folk art," which was the subject of many attempts at preservation in Euro- pean countries. This "folk romanticism," closely linked as it was to the romanticization of nature, explains the preference shown for what were seen as "untouched" peoples, so characteristic, not only of Schweinfurth but also of many travelers and anthropologists after him. That the conception of "folk art" was in no way intended as a criticism of the art of the academies but, in accordance with the ro- manticization of nature, chiefly as a criticism of industrial production, also provides an answer to the question recently raised by Curtis A. Keim as to why Schweinfurth (and subsequent travelers), in contrast to the later "discoverers" of "primitive art" in the twentieth century, ignored the figurative art of the peoples he visited.'63 This belonged to the sphere of "fine art," and the idea of comparing "primitive" cul- ture with European civilization was as foreign to Schweinfurth as to his contemporaries. The esthetically garnished mixture of disparagement, fascination, and horror, which is one of the essential features of Schweinfurth's ethnographical discourse, can be seen clearly in the description and the impressive portrait of the Mangbetu king, Mbunza ("Munsa"). The "reddish brown Caesar" and "ruler of the cannibals" is "a real savage king," whose features had "something Neroesque" about them. In his eyes burned "a wild fire of animal sensuousness." He could even be compared with Mwata Yamvo, the legendary ruler of the powerful Lunda kingdom.'64 With regard to the Mangbetu, Schweinfurth's visualization, like the written text, closely follows an- cient models. While the rendering of two Mangbetu warriors obvi- ously owes much to the classical canon of representation of the male body,165 the exoticness of Mbunza's portrait is achieved through Egyptianizing features (Figure 1; compare the photograph of a prince of the Mangbetuized Matchaga dynasty in Figure 2). 162Curtis A.

In the revised edition of his travel account, Schweinfurth him- self mentioned such a depiction.'66 There is an example in Richard Lepsius' Denkmiiler aus Agypten und Athiopien (Figure 3) as well.167 Since Schweinfurth knew Lepsius, it can be supposed that these depic- tions served as the model for the famous portrait. Thereby, an early form of Hamitic theory is implied, which can also be found in Schweinfurth's insistence on the "Semitic" features of the Mangbetu rulers."68 In his description of the Mangbetu, as is shown by the comparison with the Lunda kingdom, Schweinfurth overestimated both the com- plexity of the political organization and the independence of their ar- tistic production. He believed the Mangbetu principalities to be larger, more centralized, and more powerful than they really were. The fact that the notion of "folk culture" and of "folk art" were at that time tied to the concept of nation also prevented him from recognizing that their art and craft production was embedded in a regional context.169 If Mbunza corresponded to Mwata Yamvo, the conquering people of the Azande (whom Schweinfurth always refers to as "Niamniam" despite mentioning their real name), in line with Ritter's location of the Niam-Niam in the whole of central Africa, were comparable to the most notorious warriors and cannibals on the continent, the Fang and the so-called "Jaga."'70 Like them, the Azande were "restless 166Schweinfurth, Im Herzen, 312n. 167(12 vols: Berlin, 1849-59). 168 Im Herzen, 318, 341-42. However, Schweinfurth did not commit himself on the question of an "Asian" origin of the Mangbetu rulers. There was a theoretical conception among certain German-speaking ethnologists at the time that stressed the unity of Egyptian culture and that of the sub-Saharan African state forma- tions, without actually claiming that they originated from Asia. The defenders of this theory included Schweinfurth's influential friend, Robert Hartmann, who wrote "Untersuchungen uiber die V61kerschaften Nord-Ost-Afrikas I," Zeitschrift fiir Etbnologie 1(1869), 23-45; cf. also Thomas Zitelmann, "Formen und Institutionen politischer Herrschaft" in Jan-Georg Deutsch and Albert Wirz, eds., Gescbicbte in Afrika: Einfiibrung in Probleme und Debatten (Berlin, 1997), 204- 05. 169Schildkrout/Keim, African Reflections, 24-25, 32-34. 17oSchweinfurth's knowledge of the "Jaga" appears to be based on Dapper (cf.

In the third edition of this work these people were identified with the Bangba (another group partly under Mangbetu rule reported on by later travelers), but this is probably incorrect since they were also identified as Amadi by later explorers.184 In Schweinfurth's representation of the Azande, the "uncontrolled savagery" corresponds (in deliberate contrast to the Piaggia-Antinori report) to an unparalleled "degree of cannibalism," for which he be- lieved he could offer many unambiguous proofs.'ls In respect of Evans-Pritchard's analysis, according to which Schweinfurth's claims are "for the most part obviously pure conjecture and hearsay, prob- ably what his Arab and Nubian friends told him," we can make a few additional remarks.'86 As proof of the cannibalistic practices of the Azande, Schweinfurth mentioned, in addition to the necklaces of human teeth (which were not seen by any other traveler), so-called "trophy trees," which were posts or branched tree trunks on which, besides hunting trophies, there hung "also human skulls, dried arms and hands," as well as hu- man bones on refuse heaps near the houses.'87 Not only do these things in no way prove that human beings were eaten, it is doubtful whether Schweinfurth ever really saw them. In the report sent to Petermanns Mitteilungen in which he gave some examples to support his claim that the Azande were cannibals, there was no mention of seeing human body parts exposed on trees or among the "kitchen refuse." Nor was there in a letter, written after his return to the Bahr al-Ghazal, to another traveler whom he had befriended, Giovanni Miani: in this letter the "Christmas trees ... for comparative anato- mists"'1s were considered worth mentioning only because the hunting '83"Bemerkungen zur Karte," 137-38.

While the eating of children frequently appeared in stories of can- nibalism, Schweinfurth's remark that he took with him on the expedi- tion the two pioneering accounts of journeys in the upper Nile region (Baker's Albert N'yanza'92 and Speke's Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile193) could possibly be enlightening.

Here we find allusions to " Wilyanwantu" ("man-eaters") northwest of the Interlacustrine king- doms, who, according to information from Kamurasi, the ruler of Bunyoro, among others, added human fat to their "porridge," and whom Speke had identified with the "Niam-Niam" of the Turco- Egyptian Sudan.197 And in the report to Petermanns Mitteilungen we learn that Schweinfurth's information can again be attributed only to his companions. On an excursion from Surur's country to nearby Mount Bangenze, Schweinfurth became "very embarassed" because the termite oil, which could be used as cooking fat, was usually mixed with human fat: "My Niam-Niam servants were therefore sent out into all the villages to buy termite oil at a high price in copper, but they always came back with the same deplorable mixture, which helped to illuminate my nocturnal travel notes."198 Thus it was probably a combination of misunderstandings, ru- mors, and reciprocal influences on the basis of generally accepted ideas-perhaps also mischievousness on the part of the "Niam-Niam servants" as a natural reaction to the arrogant behavior of the ex- plorer-that led to Schweinfurth's conviction that cannibalism was common among the Azande. Another factor was Schweinfurth's in- tention not only to adapt his travel report to the collective cliches of the time, but enhance its sensational value. Thus the text is full of phrases and stereotyped images of cannibalism which, although they have no force of evidence, helped to create atmosphere and contribute effectively to the general tone, such as the term "cannibal prince[s]" for the Avungara rulers and King Mbunza; the saying "his grave was the belly of the Niamniam" (taken from the northern Sudanese cor- 19"Ibid., 166-67. 196Albert N'yanza, 1:215. 197Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile, 233, 514-15.

The sorcerer sends out his mbisimo mangu, the immaterial force or "soul" of witchcraft, to take away and eat the mbisimo pasio of the victim, the "soul" of his flesh, thus causing the person to die. As shown in an account by one of Evans-Pritchard's informants, these procedures are understood quite concretely, without making any distinction between "immate- rial" and "material" cannibalism.201 In the climate heavy with misun- derstanding, distrust, and prejudice which characterized the encounter between Khartoumers and the local population, it is possible that some notions from the field of witchcraft found their way into reports on cannibalism. IX The third traveler of this period had no influence on research. This was Giovanni Miani (1810-72), an Italian patriot exiled to Egypt, who had already traveled along the Bahr al-Jabal in 1859/60 with de Bono's trading company.202 After a long stay in his native Venice, Miani returned in 1869 to Khartoum, where he became the director of the zoological garden. When news of Schweinfurth's discoveries among the Mangbetu began to spread in the town, he set off south- ward again in 1871.

The alleged call of the cannibals for meat is found in so many sources that it would be worth investigating whether this could be a Wandermotiv: cf. among others, Heuglin, Reise, 219; Henry M.

The itinerary of this journey is of great importance in reconstructing the trade con- tacts of the period. The caravan followed an eastern route for which this is the first evidence, connecting the Bahr al-Jabal through the so- called Makaraka district to the area of the Matchaga prince, Dakpala, a rival of Mbunza. Through Mbunza's territory the traders then reached the lands of the Avungara of Ndeni's line and visited the im- portant rulers there, all sons of the great conqueror, Kipa, who had died a few years earlier.203 This journey, together with some remarks by Schweinfurth, furnishes proof that at the beginning of the 1870s regular trade relations existed between the princes descended from Kipa and the Khartoumers, although the traders were never able to establish themselves in their territories as they did in the more north- erly regions and among the Mangbetu. In addition, it enables us to make a precise reconstruction of the political situation in the Uele- Bomokandi area at the time. The hardships he had to bear during the expedition were too much for Miani; he was ill for the whole of the time and he finally died not far from Mbunza's residence. Altogether he had spent about ten months south of the Uele in the country of the Azande and Mangbetu, but unfortunately little has been preserved of his remark- able journey. Only some parts of the sparse notes he kept in his weak- ened condition later reached Europe. They were published by the journalist Manfredo Camperio in 1875, but in an altered and supple- mented form.204 The ethnographic information they contain concern- ing the areas he passed through is very scant. Camperio also mistook the then unknown river Bomokandi for the Uele (in his notes Miani spoke only of a "great river" or of the "river of Monbuttu") and therefore situated Miani's route much too far to the north.205 The cor- rect route was first established by Wilhelm Junker and Gaetano Casati, and finally reconstructed in all details by the missionary R. P. L. Lotar in the twentieth century; these scholars also located Miani's grave.206 203Cf. Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 295-97 and genealogy 9. 204Camperio, Viaggio. The original notes taken during the journey have been lost. 2-5This confusion can be attributed to Schweinfurth, who reconstructed the course of the Uele and the location of the territories of the sons of Kipa on the basis of in- formation culled from the traders: cf. the first edition of Im Herzen (1874), 2:518- 22 and map. 206Cf.

The Turkiyya first extended its control over the Bahr al-Jabal region (Equatoria province) and then, after al-Zubair had to be recognized as governor in 1873-75 due to his superior strength, also over the Bahr al-Ghazal. With the crushing of the revolt of al-Zubair's son, Sulayman, by Romolo Gessi (1878/ 79), under Charles Gordon's governorship, the southern Sudan be- came subject-at least formally-to the Turco-Egyptian regime. In re- ality a fundamental contradiction undermined the government's right from the beginning. While it strove theoretically to break the superior strength of the Khartoumers and to remedy the abuses associated with the ivory and slave trade, its representatives were unable to exer- cise any authority without the support of the traders and the network of relations with local rulers and dragomans which they had built up. The northern Nile valley Sudanese who had established themselves as members of the trading companies were a far more powerful factor in local economic and political developments than the government rep- resentatives and their troops.207 Provided that they recognized the Turkiyya, they were accepted as allies. The wukala of the trading companies were frequently retained in their former positions under nominal Turco-Egyptian rule or were even given important posts in the military administration, and many northern Sudanese served as soldiers in the irregular government troops. The economy based on violence and depredation was scarcely affected (Egypt also wanted ivory), and often enough the government representatives participated in raids and slave trading.208 In the course of the 1870s the traders extended their influence over a great part of the Azande and Mangbetu territories, established new zara'ib and, by intervening in dynastic conflicts or helping local allies to gain power, actually contributed to shaping political developments. In al-Zubayr's main area of influence in the Mbomu basin, his first ally, Tikima (Zubayr had married one of his daughters), and Mukpoi, the first ruler to become seriously involved in trade, came into conflict with him and were removed.

Gessi, who was appointed as the new governor, kept most of the agents in their posts (many had supported him against Sulayman), including the powerful Rifaci Agha, who ruled over a large district south of the Mbomu in the country of the Anunga and with whom the smaller Avungara princes from the lines of Ezo, Ngindo and Mange also maintained friendly relations. Gessi's policy of involving local rulers in the administration led him to continue supporting Zemoi and Sasa, and the Abandia prince Rafai, and these exploited their position to extend their area of influence and to bring smaller princes under their domination. At the same time, the Khartoumers continued their ex- pansion as far as the region south of the Uele.209 In the east, on the other hand, the most powerful princes of the house of Yakpati, the descendants of Bazingbi, had closed their terri- tories to the traders after Schweinfurth's journey. Only after Gessi's victory over Sulayman was Bazingbi's grandson, Ndoruma (son of Ezo), forced to recognize the government (1880), having already suf- fered a defeat at the hands of Rifaci Agha.210 The territories of Wando were reopened by cAbd Allahi, a nephew of Schweinfurth's compan- ion cAbd al-Samad,211 who became allied with Wando's son, Ukwe, and together they drove the first-born brother Mbitimo out of his territories.

Contrary to the claims of all other authors, this attack did not take place while Rifaci was in the service of the Bahr al-Ghazal traders but, as Junker stated in a much-neglected remark in 1879, when Rifaci had already gone over to Gessi, who was fighting against Sulayman: Wilhelm Junker, Adolf Schmidt, and Bruno Hassenstein, Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse von Dr. W.

This shows the absurdity of ideological claims that Ndoruma had been persuaded by Gessi's "peaceful" policy to recognize the administration (as Gessi in ibid., 468, 471, 540; Casati, Dieci anni, 1:50-51). 2t lcAbd al-Samad was killed in 1874 in a revolt of his Azande allies that was most likely led by Ngangi, the son of Muduba, whom Schweinfurth visited.

Most important of these was the Matchaga prince Yangala, son of Dakpala, in both Mbunza's former realm in the Mangbetu heartlands and the Bangba territory of his father, and further to the east, in the regions inhabited mainly by Bangba and Mamvu, the former dragoman and blacksmith Gambali.214 In 1881 the so-called "Monbuttu" district, which in- cluded the territories of the Mangbetu and of the peoples under their influence, was integrated into Equatoria, governed by Emin Pasha, but the situation remained obscure, characterized by violence and changing alliances, and the traders or government representatives continued their expansionist drive against the Mangbetu rulers in the south.215 The expansion of Egypt to the south opened up access to the "heart of Africa" to European travelers and government representa- tives within a few years. For the first time, closer contact was possible with the Azande and Mangbetu, who now appeared less dangerous and exotic. The "savages" became colonizable "Negroes," whose way of life could be inquired into in detail. Our most important sources for the nineteenth century originate from this period, and are at the same time the only ones to contain a description of the Azande and Mangbetu before their society was affected by colonial expansion. This makes it all the more important to establish whether and to what degree this description was influenced by stereotyped notions. Several travelers and government officials in the two provinces of Equatoria and Bahr al-Ghazal continued to hand down the stereo- typed image of the Azande and Mangbetu, without having had any close contact with them. Although Romolo Gessi216 appears to have 212Zaghi, Riconquista, 540; Junker, Reisen, 2:188, 201-02, 224, 346-47, 351-52, 354. 2131bid., 2:192; 3:153, 356-57; Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 332-38. 214Gambali belonged to the Mabadi, a clan of the Bantu-speaking Gbote who lived among the Bangba. 215Cf.

Other Europeans only reached the Makaraka district between the river Yei and the headwaters of the Aka where, in addition to the above-mentioned Adio, there also lived another dispersed Zande- speaking group, which was usually referred to as "Bombe" ("Bamboy"). At the beginning of 1875, this region, in which the trad- ers had become established early on, was integrated into the adminis- tration by the American, Chaill&amp;-Long, the chief of staff of Gordon's expedition in Equatoria.219 The inhabitants, who had already estab- lished a modus vivendi with the traders, submitted to this integration and served in various capacities, from war and porterage services (such as carrying two dismantled steamers past the Fola rapids on the Bahr al-Jabal) to the procurement of ivory and the production of grain for the provincial capital town of Lado. An important role was played here by Ringio, the most important local ruler in Makaraka. This politically talented man, probably an Avungara, had entered Petherick's service when he was young and then established himself as dragoman of the northern Sudanese and chief of the Azande Bamboy in Makaraka, where he acted as mediator in all matters between the local population and the government.220 Camperio as Sette anni nel Sudan egiziano: Memorie di Romiolo Gessi (Milan, 1891), but mixed arbitrarily with additional texts from other authors (including Camperio).

His descriptions testify to what is even for his time an extremely disparaging attitude to the Africans; they are scanty and show a lack of interest. In his ac- count of the occupation of the Makaraka district, he used the term Niam-Niam loosely to refer to all peoples in this ethnically very het- erogeneous area, and in descriptions he only very rarely gave exact ethnic affiliations. As the expedition stayed for less than one month and only in the zara'ib in Makaraka, Chaille-Long's Austrian com- panion, Ernst Marno (1844-83), an experienced traveler in the region, whose account is notable for its objectivity, was also unable to make detailed observations. Marno distinguished the various peoples in the area, including the "Makraka" (Azande Adio), but his descriptions are restricted to short notes on their material culture.221 Unlike Marno, both Gessi and Chaill6-Long, who showed no inter- est in ethnographic information, spoke emphatically of the cannibal- ism of the Niam-Niam. Their statements are very similar and prob- ably betray a common origin in the tales of the Nile valley Sudanese that the cannibals inevitably ate their war victims and considered the hands and feet to be special delicacies.222 It is striking that Gessi's de- scriptions of the cannibalistic habits of his "Niam-Niam" soldiers, which he claims to have observed himself, appeared only in the ex- 74; Emin, Tagebiicher, 2:376. Contrary to the unanimous statements of European observers, one of Evans-Pritchard's informants said that Ringio belonged to the non-aristocratic Aboro clan: Evans-Pritchard, "Zande Kings and Princes" in idem, Essays in Social Anthropology (London, 1962), 110-11. 221Marno, Reise, 117-31. 222 Chaill6-Long, Central Africa, 273, 287; Gessi, "Sette anni nel Sudan egiziano.

It is clear from the descriptions, for in- stance, that the administrator of the main Khartoum zariba in Makaraka, Ahmad Agha, served as informant for both of them. The culinary preference for bodily ex- tremities handed down by the northern Sudanese can already be found in Poncet, "Notice g6ographique et ethnologique," 38-39). This may also be the origin of the ubiquity of hands and feet in Schweinfurth's "proofs" of cannibalism. Evans- Pritchard's informants also said that the bodies of slain enemies were mutilated, although they claim that the ears and genitals were brought as trophies to the Avungara courts: Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 265.</page><page sequence="65">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 153 tracts from his diaries which he subsequently revised for publication in the geographical journal L'Esploratore. He even attributed the fact that the "Niam-Niam" and "Makaraka" were the only ones among the soldiers to resist the privations of the campaign against Sulayman without falling ill to their consumption of human flesh. On the other hand, in the reports which Gessi wrote to Gordon almost daily during the campaign, and which of all his writings are the most factual, there is never any mention, in respect of the selfsame events, of cannibalis- tic feasts and any ability to ward off illness.223 Thus it seems that con- firming Niam-Niam cannibalism had already become a literary topos in travel descriptions of the southern Sudan. It is also found in the writings of both the level-headed Marno, who, however, situated in the past the cannibalistic customs of the Azande Adio known to him, and the missionary, Robert W. Felkin, who visited the Bahr al-Ghazal at the end of 1879 with Charles Wilson on the way back from Buganda, and who repeated Gessi's assertions, as well as Schwein- furth's claims regarding the eating of children (without acknowledg- ing the source).224 There was also Richard Buchta (1845-94), a painter and photogra- pher from Galicia, to whom we owe the first photographs taken in the upper Nile region. While living in Egypt Buchta traveled through the southern provinces of the Turco-Egyptian Sudan from August 1878 to about February 1880. He wrote only an incomplete report for Petermanns Mitteilungen of this journey, which led him as far as Bunyoro.225 He published the photographs in a two-volume album, Die oberen Nil-Lander. Volkstypen und Landschaften (Berlin, 1881), which contained 160 photos and an introduction by Robert Hartmann.226 However, Buchta did not visit the real Avungara Azande and Mangbetu country, but traveled only through the Makaraka district for about a month.227 The fourteen photographs entitled "Niam-Niam" in his album must therefore be of Chief Ringio's Azande Bamboy, with whom Buchta recorded he had stayed, either in the Kabajendi zariba or nearby.22s 223Cf.

The very same picture, which in Buchta's work is only entitled "Niam-Niam homestead," was also reproduced in the first volume of Wilhelm Junker's travel account, but with the caption "Bombe Chief Ringio and his wives," which is more likely to be correct, since Junker knew Ringio well and Buchta himself collaborated on the publication of this first volume.229 Another eighteen photographs showed represen- tatives of the other ethnic groups in the Makaraka district: the "Makraka" or Azande Adio, the Baka, the Mundu, the Avukaya and the P6julu. The Mangbetu and "Akka" (pygmy) women in the pic- tures might also have been photographed in the zara'ib of Makaraka.230 Buchta arranged his pictures as anthropological/ethnographic documents according to the current conventions for representing for- eign peoples in travel accounts. The portraits are either photographs of types (sometimes in profile and full face, in the classical manner) to be utilized by physical anthropology, or, like the photo of Ringio's wives, they are intended to show aspects of the material culture. But esthetic and exotic aspects were not neglected and the photos are also artistically pleasing. They served as models for many wood engrav- ings and lithographs illustrating the works of Wilson and Felkin and of Junker, being copied more or less faithfully. Thus the picture of Ringio and his wives was reused in Wilson's and Felkin's account to illustrate the process of food preparation, but in the wood engraving the figure of the Arabized chief, which is only irritating for this pur- pose, was removed.23' In the case of Junker, some photographs were also directly reproduced; a great number can be found in Gaetano Casati's report of his travels, Dieci anni in Equatoria e ritorno con Emin Pascia. Together with Schweinfurth's drawings, Buchta's photos served repeatedly during the following decades as a model for illustra- tions, and thus had a decisive influence on the visual perception in Europe of the peoples of this region. XI The writings of three Europeans who personally visited the Azande and Mangbetu are indispensable for any reconstruction of the history 229Die oberen Nil-Ldnder, plate 86; Reisen, 1:429. 230Die oberen Nil-Lainder, plates 93, 96, 97. 231Wilson/Felkin, Uganda, 2:139.</page><page sequence="67">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 155 of the Azande: Wilhelm Junker, Gaetano Casati and Emin, the gover- nor of Equatoria. These three differed greatly from each other in char- acter, and with regard to their motivation, interests, and scientific am- bitions and opportunities. Their reports should nevertheless be seen as being connected. They were all three affected by the same circum- stances, when the Mahdiyya, which had been expanding from the north from 1881, seized power in the Bahr al-Ghazal in 1884, and reached Equatoria not long after. When the Azande and Mangbetu areas were evacuated by goverment troops, Casati and Junker had to retreat to Emin in Lado, and later to the south of the province of Equatoria when the Mahdist forces advanced to the Bahr al-Jabal. Junker succeeded in reaching Bagamoyo at the end of 1886 via Bunyoro and Buganda, following the route of the East African trad- ers, while Emin and Casati held on until Stanley's "relief expedition" arrived, and reached the East African coast with it at the end of 1889. As they exchanged information and were already in contact with each other before the outbreak of the revolution, by letter or directly, their writings cannot be seen as being completely independent of each other.232 Wilhelm Junker (1840-92), the son of a rich German banker from Russia, was able to finance his own travels, which he began after completing his medical studies without the state examination. On the advice of Schweinfurth, Rohlfs, and Nachtigal, whom he had met at a geographical congress, Junker traveled to Khartoum in 1876 with the aim of exploring Dar Fur, but traveled instead to Lado, and from here into the Makaraka district.233 This first journey took about a year, and a report of it is published in the first volume of his work, Reisen in Afrika. During this trip he made several tours within Makaraka, 232Many letters sent from Emin to Junker were published with his journals and in Buchta, Der Sudan unter digyptischer Herrscleft. Junker lived with Emin in Lado and informed him of his observations (Reisen, 3:387, 404). Casati accompanied Emin on his tour of inspection to Monbuttu, procured ethnographical and zoo- logical items for his collection (Casati, Dieci anni, I:xii, 136; Emin, Tagebiicher, 2:463; 3:40, 54), and also seems to have imparted ethnographical information to him. Thus a list of the Meje clans comes from Casati (Emin, Tagebiicher 2:468); the statement that the lances of the "Akka" (pygmies) really came from the Mabodo, can be found both in Casati (letter published in Esploratore 7[1883], 281) and in Emin (Tagebiicher, 2:464). Casati and Junker had also met in 1881 and 1882 in the area south of the Uele. As already mentioned, Junker's misunder- standing of the route followed by Miani might also originate from Casati. 233Cf. Junker, Reisen, 2:1-2, 271; Ludwig Hevesi, Wilhelm Junker. Lebensbild eines Afrikaforschers (Berlin, 1896), 2, 35-37, 63-83, 98. Junker's biographer Hevesi knew the traveler and was given his private letters and other documents by the family.</page><page sequence="68">156 Paola Ivanov accompanied the provincial troops into the Bahr al-Ghazal, and joined an expedition (really a raid) to the south as far as the Nile- Congo watershed in the country of the Keliko and Lugbara. After a short stay in Europe, he returned to Khartoum at the end of 1879 to travel through the areas newly acquired by Gessi, and in particular to determine the course of the Uele, which was still a subject of dispute. Constantly driven by a "sense of duty" to "work" and produce "results," Junker accomplished what was probably one of the most meticulous scientific expeditions of his time.234 Generously fitted out and accompanied by the taxidermist Bohndorff, who usually attended to the greater part of the luggage, Junker was able to use government stations and the courts of government-friendly princes as bases, and to carry out extensive tours from them with less luggage (according to the cartographer of his journeys, Bruno Hassenstein, he traveled more than 6250 km!), covering large parts of the Azande and Mangbetu countries in a dense network. During his exploration of the Nile-Congo watershed, which took him some three and a half years, Junker visited, among other places, the territories of the Avungara of Yakpati's line, including the princi- palities of Ndoruma and Wando; on the Uele, the Amadi on the northern shore of the bend of the Uele and the Barambu to the south; the lands of Kipa's descendants (Ndeni's line) to the north and the south of the Bomokandi (including the powerful princes Kana and Bakangai); and among the Mangbetu and Mangbetu-influenced peoples, the territories of the Matchaga Yangala, the Mabadi Gambali (stretching as far as the Mamvu, south of the Bomokandi) and of the Mangbetu Azanga Mombele (son of Mbunza's eldest brother, Omoapa), where he reached the river Nepoko and thus his most southerly point. The western routes are less close to each other, but Junker was nevertheless the first explorer to visit the regions of the Anunga princes and the lands of the Abandia systematically. He reached the Uele twice more: first in the country of the Azande ruled by the princes of Mange's line near the Uere-Uele confluence, and then among the Abandia in the area controlled by the agent cAli Kobbo, only a few days' march from the mouth of the Mbomu. Junker's impressive thoroughness was embodied in a three-volume account of his travels, containing a wealth of information which far surpasses all other sources from the nineteenth century for this region. The geographical maps, drawn by Hassenstein on the basis of Junker's carefully recorded routes, were a brilliant achievement. They 234Junker, Reisen, 2:208-09; 3:72, 169.</page><page sequence="69">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 157 show the political and ethnic divisions, and contain information re- garding the vegetation of the areas the group passed through. In addi- tion to this work, a special issue of Petermanns Mitteilungen was de- voted entirely to his scientific findings; there Junker's precise ethno- graphical overview gives additional information on the peoples he vis- ited.235 In comparison the work of Gaetano Casati (1838-1902) appears at first to be very modest. Casati was a Lombardian officer who after leaving the army in 1879 joined the staff of the Milanese journal L'Esploratore, the official organ of the Societil di esplorazione com- merciale in Africa which had been founded in the same year by Manfredo Camperio.236 Gessi requested this journal to send him a cartographer, whom he would supply with the necessary equipment to go and explore the Uele. Casati, who had served as a topographer in the army, thereupon set out for the Bahr al-Ghazal, where he arrived in August 1880. But Gessi soon left the province and Casati found himself "catapulted into the centre of Africa, all alone and practically without means."237 He set off to the south nevertheless and reached the territory of Gambali in Monbuttu via the old route, already taken by Miani, through the Makaraka district. He stayed south of the Uele for a good three years (from about May 1881 to July 1884), under- taking several tours, and in the whole of the time making only one short excursion to Emin in Lado (February-May 1883). Casati was very badly equipped and apparently did not have very high scientific standards (or lacked the means for meeting them).238 He was a solitary person who seems to have been happy in the colo- nial situation, living in foreign places with indigenous companions who gave him their loyalty.239 Thus he left Monbuttu only after the 235Junker/Schmidt/Hassenstein, Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse: Hassenstein's gen- eral map can be found there in four sheets, and in Reisen, 1:plate 9. The account also contains several detailed maps. 236As the name suggests, the goal of this geographical society and of the journal, which followed the line of popular science, was to promote commercial colonial- ism. It was supported by important personalities in the Milanese financial and in- dustrial worlds, and had close links with Romolo Gessi, who was the representa- tive in Africa of the pharmaceutical industrialist Carlo Erba.

But Evans-Pritchard is wrong when he says that Casati wrote his travel account, Dieci anni in Equatoria e ritorno con Emin Pascia (1891), from memory.241 The information in the travel account is already contained in nuce in the reports which he had sent to Camperio during his stay in Equatoria.242 He supplemented the terse information in the letters to a greater extent than was usual in travel reports, with geographical and historical descriptions taken from other works, including those of Junker and Schweinfurth. For all these reasons many critics have rated his account of lesser value than the writings of Schweinfurth, for instance, and especially those of Junker. Indeed, Junker, who was able to save his meticulously kept jour- nals following scientific principles, described very exactly in his travel account the geographical, political, and ethnic situation of the areas he visited; he also collected clear historical information, including an extensive genealogy of the Avungara princes and their non-ruling rela- tives.243 He expressly emphasized the ethnic complexity of the Avungara principalities, which makes the data he collected particu- larly valuable for historical reconstruction.244 In contrast, Casati's in- formation is less precise and detailed, and his descriptions are some- times limited to laconic lists of names of rulers and places. His deter- mination of geographical locations is also inexact.245 Moreover, 240Emin, Tagebiicher, 3:40, 54; Junker, Reisen, 3:469, 490; Casati, Dieci anni, 1:266. 241Evans-Pritchard, "Zande Cannibalism," 143; idem, "Sources," 143. 242Three letters, (7 September 1880 to 13 November 1880), Esploratore 5(1881), 66-67, 91-94, 124-25; "Dal Bahr-el-Gazill all'Uelle" 6 letters (6 March 1881 to 29 December 1881), Esploratore 6(1882), 253-61; eight letters (10 September 1881 to 13 April 1883), Esploratore 7(1883), 263-65, 277-92; ten letters, Esplorazione commerciale in Africa 2(1887), 168-87. 243Errors in the text of his travel account regarding the descent of two princes, which were critically remarked on by Evans-Pritchard ("Sources," 141; cf. Junker, Reisen, 2:172; 3:39), can be considered as oversights. The line of descent is given correctly in the genealogical table (ibid., volume 3). 244Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse, 30. 24SSee the maps of the Uele in the travel account and in Esplorazione conmmnerciale in Africa 2(1887).</page><page sequence="71">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 159 Casati tended to supplement his observations and facts with fantastic details and rather clumsy hypothetical dialogues, which were sharply criticized by Evans-Pritchard.246 Special care must be taken with the English and German translations of his travel account, as the render- ing in a Germanic language of Casati's involved and often obscure sentence constructions can be very misleading. Not even Casati was so eager for sensational effects that he would say he had seen "flying serpents," as Evans-Pritchard believes. What he mentioned were harmless "serpenti in fuga," not flying snakes but fleeing snakes!247 With regard to his information on the Azande, it must also be re- membered that, apart from the eastern Adio and Bamboy, Casati, un- like Junker, had contact only with the Azande under the rule of Kipa's descendants, and this only during a two-month tour (from about mid- April to the end of June 1882). He made only rudimentary attempts at determining the ethnic origin of the subjects of the princes he vis- ited, and his historical information is also somewhat confused. Casati spent the rest of his time with the Mangbetu and Mangbetu-influ- enced peoples. He traveled through the area of the Mabadi Gambali and twice through the Meje lands of Azanga Kpwokpwo (Mbunza's brother) south of the Bomokandi. He knew the region under the domination of the Matchaga prince Yangala, which he crossed several times in the course of his tours, especially well. He lived in Tangasi, the most important government base in Monbuttu and the seat of Yangala, and later in a nearby government station at the confluence of Gada and Uele (zariba cAli), for the last year of his stay in Monbuttu, until July 1884.248 But unlike Junker, Casati showed little detachment in his descrip- tions and considerable powers of empathy. Both travelers were con- vinced supporters of a European civilizing mission, but while Casati had visions of a moderate form of commercial colonialism, Junker advocated strict colonial subjugation. Casati readily attributed posi- tive characteristics to the "blacks" ("neri"), and puts any negative ones down to their lack of "education," and his colonialist tendencies do not go beyond somewhat grandiloquent declarations of intention and pleas for the abolition of slavery and the introduction of free 246Cf.

He devoted much space to describing the life at court-assemblies, dances, the role of women-and the material cul- ture and its social embedment.2s0 He is the only traveler to comment on an important aspect of the Mangbetu methods of rule: that the princes were recognized as leaders by their mothers' lineage (usually of non-Mangbetu origin), which helped them to assert their claims to power within the Mangbetu dynasty.2s5 For Junker on the other hand, "the Negro" is childish and lazy, without honor and untruthful. He insisted that the European Kulturmensch ("cultured" European) must adopt the role of master and educator and, where necessary, bring about the subjugation of the Africans through forced labor and corporal punishment.2s2 With such an attitude it is not surprising that the traveler struggling through Af- rica, admitting that he was sometimes lacking in humor and patience, should be uninterested in or contemptuous of the life of the people he visited.2s3 The huge amount of data Junker collected does not give a coherent picture of the culture of the Azande. Evans-Pritchard pointed out that Junker, who was very annoyed by the poison oracle, had not understood how it was used.2s4 We also learn little about how the political system ("higher Negro politics") worked,2ss al- though he frequently visited court assemblies, got to know some princes quite well, including Ndoruma, and formed a close relation- ship with the Arabic-speaking Zemoi, with whom he lived for over 249Cf. for instance Casati, Dieci anni, 1:42, 47-48, 165-68, 246-49. As a soldier himself, Casati especially praised the "black soldier," to whom he attributed "moral superiority" (probably in contrast to Egyptian and Turkish soldiers, who were considered to be corrupt), "physical strength," "bravery," and "obedience," although he still thought that "education" was required (ibid., 1:54-56). Casati saw the social system of the peoples he visited as one of "equity and justice" (ibid., 1:251). Casati's positive opinions, which were in harmony with the com- mercial orientation of early Italian colonialism, naturally had an ideological bias, just like Junker's negative ones, but in contrast to Junker they seem to have en- hanced his receptiveness for the cultures he observed. 2SoE.g.

The most talented person to enter the Uele area in the nineteenth century was Emin Pasha, the governor of Equatoria. Emin (1840-92), whose real name was Eduard Carl Oscar Theodor Schnitzer, was born in Silesia to Jewish parents and baptized in his early childhood. After taking his doctorate in medicine he was not admitted to the state ex- amination for unknown reasons, whereupon he left Europe for the Ottoman Empire and stayed there from 1864 to 1874, serving among other things as quarantine doctor in Antivari (today Bar, Montenegro). He arrived in Khartoum, apparently destitute, at the end of 1875.258 Claiming to be a Turk with the name of Mehmed Emin, he was appointed by Gordon as a doctor in the service of Equatoria. In 1878, after holding the position of "chief medical of- ficer for all Equatorial provinces" and carrying out two long diplo- matic missions to, among other places, Buganda and Bunyoro, he be- came the governor of Equatoria (the importance of which was, how- ever, on the wane since attempts to annex Bunyoro and Buganda had been abandoned), first under the command of Gessi, and finally, from 1880, directly under the Governor-General. Emin was neither a part of the early colonial movement nor of the scientific world. A very withdrawn person, he was convinced of his own worth, but required recognition and was sensitive to criticism. In his career in the Sudan and in his scientific activity he seems to have sought the recognition which had been denied to him since his sudden flight from Europe.259 When the Mahdiyya took over the whole of 256"If I frequently speak of princes, you must imagine in most cases a scoundrel with scarcely a hundred souls as his subjects. ... These individuals have to be taught respect. A box on the ear is often more effective for this purpose than all the patience in the world."

The most apposite</page><page sequence="74">162 Paola Ivanov the Sudan in 1881-85, only Emin was able to hold his province and he suddenly found himself (more than he wished) at the center of public interest and of the race of the European powers to carve up Af- rica. Following the ruinous end of Stanley's "relief expedition," which served the interests of both Great Britain and Leopold, Equatoria could no longer be held, since Emin's officers revolted, and the large- scale expedition returned decimated to the coast. As a result, Emin became the object of hefty, biased controversies, as Stanley blamed him for his own failure. The fact that Emin denied his German origin when he was working in Equatoria, practiced the Islamic religion, and showed no heroic or militaristic inclinations, was also a thorn in the side of the public in the German Empire.260 Even his most friendly critics still accused him of "inconstancy" and weak leadership.26' However, the value of Emin's scientific work, which fully occupied him in addition to his official duties in Equatoria, is undisputed. In the course of the missions and tours of inspection which he carried characterization is given by Casati (Dieci anni, 1:228), who dispensed with Emin's "orientalization," which is still evoked today for want of a better description: "Of a serious and concentrated character, fond of the natural sciences and of being alone, Emin avoided contacts. It seemed as if, while not exactly proud, he was ex- ceedingly aware of his own superiority, and disdained the idea of looking closely into the talents of those around him; he believed that he could do everything by himself, and on the day when he alone could no longer halt the fast approaching dissolution, he erred in his judgements, changed them frequently, and thus did great harm to himself." 260Thus it was frequently claimed that Emin's adherence to Islam was only a cam- ouflage in partibus infidelium, but this is not tenable in view of the number of Eu- ropean officials in the Turco-Egyptian Sudan: cf. Georg Schweinfurth et al. eds., Eine Sammiung von Reisebriefen und Berichten Dr. Emin-Pascha's aus den ehe- mnals dgyptischen Aequatorialprovinzen und deren Grenzliindern (Leipzig, 1888), v-vi, and Georg Schweitzer, Emin Pascha. Eine Darstellung seines Lebens und Wirkens mit Benutzung seiner Tagebiicher, Briefe und wissenschaftlichen Aufzeichnungen (Berlin, 1898), 77. From scattered remarks in his journals and by people who knew him, it seems rather that Emin had tried to adopt a new, non- European identity in the Sudan; Emin, Tagebiicher, 1:137-38, 148-49, 151, 192; 2:33; Schweitzer, Emin Pascha, 226-27; Junker, Reisen, 3:427; Hevesi, Wilhelm Junker, 99, 211-12; Hill, Memoirs, 64-65. 26'For instance, Schweitzer, Emin Pascha, 329; Junker, Reisen, 3:448, 457, 561- 65. Among the many works on Emin, Roger Jones' The Rescue of Emin Pascha: The Story of Henry M. Stanley and the Emin Pascha Relief Expedition, 1887- 1889 (London, 1972) is the most balanced. Emin Pascha, the biography written by Schweitzer, Emin's cousin, is still indispensable for the great number of unpub- lished documents it contains, although the author sometimes erred in his interpre- tation of political events in Equatoria and his judgments are nationalistically col- ored. Although Vita Hassan's, Die Wahrheit iiber Emin Pascha, die agyptische Aequatorialprovinz und den Sudan (2 vols.: Berlin, 1893), and especially Casati's Dieci anni, contain some misjudgments, they are important eyewitness reports.</page><page sequence="75">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 163 out from Lado, Emin filled his journals with an impressive quantity of information about the areas he traveled through. He used this infor- mation in reports to specialist journals or letters to various scholars such as Schweinfurth and the ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub, who were his only link with Europe. The notes in his journals and the es- says based on them agree with each other in all essential points and are notable for their precise descriptive style which hardly ever seeks to produce sensational effects.262 During the time when Emin was holding out in Equatoria, Schweinfurth, Felkin, Hartlaub, and Ratzel made a collection of his most important letters and reports.263 His journals were later published, together with selected letters, by Franz Stuhlmann in 1916-27.264 Even if Emin mainly considered himself a naturalist, and in particular an ornithologist, his ethnographic and linguistic notes are of considerable value, in addition to his geographi- cal investigations. Unfortunately, Emin never visited the main territories of the Avungara Azande. He undertook only two inspection trips to Makaraka, where he met the Adio and Bamboy,26s and one trip to Monbuttu (May-September 1883), passing through the territory of Gambali to the main zariba of Tangasi, near Yangala's residence.266 However, most scholars have failed to notice that there were Azande (albeit not under Avungara rule) living in the region of the rivers Dungu and Aka, through which the old trading route from Makaraka to Gambali's territory in eastern Monbuttu passed, which had already been followed by Miani and Casati.267 The writings of Emin and 262The journals are clearly of a scholarly nature and were intended for publication or for use in preparing scientific reports. In addition to his scientific, geographical, and ethnographic observations, Emin noted only major events and largely dis- pensed with recounting his personal opinions and experiences. 263Schweinfurth et al., Saminlung. 264Volumes 1 to 4 of the published journals cover the period from 1875 to 1889 (Emin's time in the Sudan up to the evacuation and the march to the East African coast), although the notes published in volume 4 have been cut by about a quarter. The journals from the period of Emin's last expedition in the service of German East Africa up to his death (1890-92) were to have been published in a fifth vol- ume, but it has never appeared.

Emin also col- lected information in Tangasi about the neighboring peoples, includ- ing the Azande and Barambu, and he knew several Avungara princes, who had visited him with their retinues in Makaraka or Monbuttu.268 Linguistically gifted and in full command of the Arabic language (unlike Junker and Casati), this undemanding and adaptable scholar was integrated into his environment.269 He had many years of experi- ence of communication and mediation with the local people and hardly ever made derogatory remarks or showed disdainful behavior toward them, but gained satisfaction from the fact that he, unlike his European predecessors, had succeeded in forming good relations. Al- though Emin's tours of inspection were usually very short, this is counterbalanced by the fact that he was a precise observer with mul- tiple interests, and by the favorable position he enjoyed through his office and through his acquaintance with the most important princes, which helped him to gain information, especially regarding social and political organization. For example, Emin gave a precise division into clans for the Adio of Makaraka, as well as information on their power structure, and he was the only one to note that scattered groups of "Abaingmindi" (the Bantu-speaking Abangbinda), who were otherwise integrated into the Azande cluster, spoke another lan- guage in addition to Zande.270 His description of the political system of the Mangbetu reveals as- tonishing insights into the way it worked and also includes the realm of ideology. Thus Emin recognized the important role played by a prince's personal popularity and abilities when claiming power, the small distance between the ruling dynasty and their subjects, the need to create a clientele as one of the factors of power, and the opportuni- ties which clients had of rising socially through special services ren- dered to the ruler.271 Of all Emin's extensive and accurate accounts, there are only brief mentions of the Azande population. The route is shown in Junker's general map (Reisen, l:plate 9). 268These were Wando and his sons, the sons of Gbudwe (all Yakpati's line), Mazinda (Bugwa's line) who ruled in the Amadi area in the bend of the Uele, and Bangoya and Bowili, son and grandson respectively of Kipa (Ndeni's line). 269Emin also seems to have learned Kinyoro (Tagebiicher, 2:353), and he had a good understanding of languages in general. He correctly described the division of the Bari-speaking groups of the Bahr al-Jabal region, for example: ibid., 2:384; Sanmmlung, 368. 270Tagebiicher, 2:378, 384; Samnmlung, 375-76; cf. Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, tables 32-36. 271Tagebiicher, 2:449-51; Sammlung, 202-03, 206.</page><page sequence="77">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 165 those describing material culture are the richest in detail; the informa- tion they contain ranges from determination of materials and the de- scription of working processes to explaining social contexts.272 Emin also recognized and described the essential elements of the agricul- tural system of the Azande Adio and Azande Bamboy, namely, shift- ing cultivation with utilization of the spontaneous yield from the fal- low land, and especially the association of different crops within a single field.273 In considering Emin's official position, however, it must be taken into account that princes and other rulers may have deliberately mis- led him in order to further their own political interests. The Mangbetu genealogy given to him by Prince Azanga Kpwokpwo could be such a case of manipulation.274 Tuba, who was the father of Azanga himself and of Mbunza, appears here as the brother of Na- biembali, the founder of the Mangbetu kingdom, and not as his son, as in the genealogy accepted today.27s This problem still needs to be addressed, since Yangala-who as a Matchaga had no apparent rea- son for manipulating the Mangbetu genealogy-gave the same ver- sion.276 A discussion of this question by specialists of Mangbetu his- tory could throw light on the criteria for legitimation of Mangbetu rule. Due to the changed conditions of contact and the development of colonial ideologies, the picture of the Azande and Mangbetu given to us by Emin, Junker, and Casati generally tends less toward exoticness and hyperbole than that offered by Schweinfurth. Nevertheless, the main components of the stereotypes established by Schweinfurth are preserved and in part set in the past, before contact with the Khartoumers, which is portrayed as a destructive clash. Thus in all three authors we find claims regarding the cultural superiority of the Mangbetu over the other ethnic groups in the region-an argument which, in passages strongly reminiscent of Schweinfurth's manner of expression, is mainly supported by referring to the supposed higher quality of their craft products.277 With regard to the political power of the Mangbetu, all three believed that this had been broken by the 272Tagebiicher, 2:445, 447-48, 452-57, 473; Sammlung, 188-89, 194, 208-11. 273Tagebiicher, 2:372-74, 381, 418-19; cf.

It is striking that Casati and Emin relativized this artistic pre- dominance in other places, for instance, when pointing out the artistic merits of the crafts of the Azande and Barambu.78 Junker gave prac- tically no examples to support his very general remarks on the high cultural level of the Mangbetu, and suggested that their alleged politi- cal decline was accompanied by an artistic decline.279 In a letter to Schweinfurth, Emin also stressed that the "authentic" Mangbetu cul- ture was now to be seen only far from the zara'ib.280 While Junker, in particular, expressed his opinions about the Azande, Emin and Casati, who were less familiar with them, are more reticent. Even if "savagery" is no longer particularly emphasized in their descriptions of the Azande (and the Mangbetu), Junker retained its complement, a warlike nature. Instead of being "savage" warriors, the Azande now appear as "martial" and radiate "power-conscious masculinity."281 To this "brave and robust people"282 he attributed Spartan cultural features-which he found quite appealing-such as simplicity of dress and courtly culture.283 For example, Junker de- scribed Prince Bakangai (of Ndeni's line), who lived south of the Bomokandi, as if he had not given up the "traditional simplicity" of the Avungara princes (contained in the stereotype), while Casati noted with regard to this powerful prince: "Bakangoi almost always wears clothes made of cloth which he gets from the merchants. He has an Arab bed with rich covers and elegant pillows, lamps, crockery and glass beads of every kind."284 As with the Mangbetu, Junker had recourse to the postulate of an "earlier, one might say classical period" of political and artistic integ- rity.28s He scorned the supposed loss of power in his time of the 278Casati, Dieci anni, 1:85, 116, 172; Emin, Samnmlung, 211. 279Wissenschaftliche Ergebuisse, 35; Reisen, 2:331, 514. 280Sanmmlnung, 442. 28tCasati's and Emin's descriptions of the Azande contrast strikingly with that of Schweinfurth: the Italian stressed (Casati, Dieci anni, 1:182) their "docile and good character" as well as their openness and adaptability. Emin even wrote (Tagebiicher, 2:422): "Their facial expression is peculiarly mild, and matches their language well, which is flowing and rich in vowels." Junker still tried to include the notion of savagery in his description (Reisen, 1:296; 2:132-33, 288), but the relevant passages were inserted so clumsily and without any relation to the con- text that it is not hard to identify them as literary additions in the style of Schweinfurth. 282Ibid., 3:559. 283For example ibid., 2:207-08, 353; 3:592. 2841bid., 3:2; Casati, Dieci anni, 1:176. 28SReisen, 2:369.</page><page sequence="79">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 167 Avungara princes and their "particularism" (Kleinstaaterei)-which was really characteristic of the Avungara-and therefore greatly exag- gerated the extension of the territories of earlier rulers. He also saw a connection between this loss of power and the decline in local craft production, and he considered that the cultural independence of the Azande, emphasized by Schweinfurth, was on the wane.286 Schweinfurth's influence on his successors can be seen very clearly in the matter of cannibalism, which was not only accepted as a certain fact with regard to the Azande and Mangbetu, but was also attributed to neighboring or subdued peoples. Schweinfurth's motifs were adopted, such as the observation in connection with the Mangbetu that "primitive peoples who have reached a higher cultural level are devoted to cannibalism,"287 and that cannibalism was even more widespread among them than among the Azande;288 the fact that the skulls of slain enemies, cleaned of the flesh, were supplied to the trav- elers for their anatomical collections (which can be explained by the fact that they paid for skulls, not for heads, with valuable copper which was otherwise accessible only to the princes in exchange for ivory);289 or the notion that there is a connection between cannibal- ism and the eating of animals that are taboo in Europe and the Is- lamic world-monkeys or, as in Schweinfurth, dogs.290 Once again, it is not necessary to repeat here Evans-Pritchard's demonstration that not one of the three scholars can supply any sound evidence of cannibalistic practices (which is all the more signifi- cant because at least Junker and Casati lived among the Azande and Mangbetu for a long time).291 But it must be emphasized that Schweinfurth's influence was very direct in the case of Junker and Emin. Junker knew Schweinfurth well, calling him his "friend and master."292 After his return from East Africa he spent three months with him in Cairo.293 According to Junker's biographer, Schweinfurth 286Ibid., 2:142-43, 248, 295, 362, 369-70; 3:4, 157, 220, 292, 295; Wissen- schaftliche Ergebnisse, 31-32. 287Junker, Reisen, 2:297; cf.

He is sup- posed to be the source of "many interpolations, particularly of a zoo- logical and botanical nature," and of longer treatises on specific sub- jects with which he was well acquainted; all the proofs were sent to him and he made "critical notes in the margins or specialized scien- tific additions."294 Schweinfurth's backing was important for every traveler to central Africa, but for the outcast Emin his support was es- sential for getting established in Europe. How strongly this affected the texts intended for publication-and how greatly it influenced Emin's representation of the facts-is shown by comparing the jour- nal entries he made during his tour of inspection to the Mangbetu, whom Schweinfurth had raised to a myth, and the corresponding es- says and letters (several letters were addressed to Schweinfurth).29s Emin departed from the journal entries to a greater extent than nor- mal and obviously reproduced the topics of the "master." Thus we find the romanticization of nature,296 the painting of the environment of the Mangbetu as a Garden of Eden,297 and the conception of the history of Africa as "waves of tribal migration" ( Wogen und Wandern der Volkerstiimme).298 Cannibalism is naturally a central element. During his trip to the Mangbetu Emin made only a few references to it in his journal, which were clearly based on speculations and ru- mors; in the essays and letters, on the other hand, he exploited the topic at great length and tried to give the impression that his claims were supported by facts.299 Those cases in which Junker and Casati personally claimed to have witnessed cannibalism suggest a further possible basis for the tales of cannibalism. Both claimed to have proof that during their stay with southern Mangbetu princes (Casati with Azanga Kpwokpwo, Junker with Azanga Mombele) a woman was executed and eaten. Casati mentioned that he had seen "a piece of roast leg," and Junker wrote that his Amadi servant Dsumbe, who witnessed an execution, brought him-at his request-"the boiled foot" of the guilty woman.300 More instructive here is Dsumbe's account that the woman was lynched be- cause she had been accused of witchcraft. Her body was slit open and the gall bladder removed and burned "because it is thought to contain witchcraft.

The lynching and burning of corpses was also widespread within this witchcraft com- plex.302 For the Mangbetu and the peoples under their domination (Azanga Mombele ruled a very mixed population), there is only sparse information, but the burning of corpses is believed to have sometimes occurred among them.303 Even an autopsy (which was also widespread among the Azande) can appear as a gutting of the corpse for culinary purposes to foreigners who do not understand its mean- ing.304 Moreover, burning a corpse on an open fire is a long process and may be incomplete. Given some misunderstandings and a willing- ness on their part to believe rumors of cannibalism, it is possible that Casati's and Junker's remarks, as well as in part the frequent claims in the sources of the bodies of executed persons being eaten could be due to the fact that the bodies of individuals accused of witchcraft were cut open and possibly burned. Finally, two examples can be given to show that in a situation of general receptiveness, accusations of cannibalism were also exploited by local rulers for their own political purposes. According to Casati, Chief Ringio from Makaraka reported to him that Prince Wando had complained during a visit to the district that he had not been offered any human flesh by his host Ringio. Loyal to the government, he is supposed to have said: "But in Makraka there is nothing like that any more, and I would not tolerate anyone trying it again."305 Evans- Pritchard sneers at the hypothetical dialog (and at the allusion to Wando, who had been singled out by Schweinfurth and then Emin as an opponent of cannibalism), but this was a common stylistic device in travel accounts of the period, a literary convention in which not the form but the meaning of the passage is what counts.306 Wando had indeed been in Makaraka a few months before Casati, and had met with Emin to discuss plans for settling with his people in the district, which belonged to Equatoria, ostensibly in order to escape persecu- 302Hermann Baumann, "Likundu.

In a similar way rumors circulated about the extraordinary cannibalistic inclinations of Mbunza's sons when they visited Emin in the former territory of their father, now un- der the rule of Yangala, in the hope of being reinstalled there.308 These rumors were most probably started by Yangala and his north- ern Sudanese friends, who were involved in the removal of Mbunza. XII The writings of travelers are the main sources for any investigation of the Khartoum ivory and slave trade and its consequences in the re- gion. However, their interpretations of the facts is affected in part by the same ignorance of the realities of the situation which we have shown with respect to ethnographical descriptions, but above all by an extreme hostility toward Islam, rooted in European hegemonic ambitions in the region, and based mainly on the accusation of slav- ing. The patterns of interpretation that were formed at that time and handed down until the present assume complete subjection and gener- alized enslavement of the local population by the traders, and do not do justice to the more complex sociopolitical implications of northern Sudanese settlement in the southern Sudan. I give here a few examples to show how consulting all existing sources can relativize these inter- pretations and provide a basis for a more realistic assessment of the situation.309 A first point in all historical reconstructions concerns the relation- ship between the Avungara and the Khartoumers, and especially the princes' "resistance" to their advance. Following the first period of intensive but relatively peaceful contacts, for which we have Piaggia's accounts and other sources from the 1860s, there was a deterioration characterized by armed conflicts, such as those which occurred 307Emin, Sammlung, 364; Tagebiicher, 2:377. Wando was really trying to expand his territory, which Emin put a stop to when he realized the prince's intentions, ibid., 412; cf. Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Gescbicbte, 287n31. 30SEmin, Tagebiicher, 2:464; Sammlung, 447. 309The activities of the traders from the Swahili coast, known in the region as "Wangwana," mainly affected the Mangbetu/Matchaga and their southern neigh- bors and the southern Abandia, but only the borders of the Avungara territories.</page><page sequence="83">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 171 around 1871/72 between al-Zubayr and the northwestern Avungara rulers, the Anunga Tikima and Mukpoi. In 1870 Schweinfurth re- corded actions among the eastern Avungara of the house of Yakpati against the presence of the traders in their areas, which were mainly initiated by Gbudwe and Ndoruma, but which also involved Bazingbi's other ruling sons.310 In particular Schweinfurth reported that Ndoruma and his troops had destroyed a subsidiary zariba be- longing to the trader Abu Qurun (wakil of a big establishment in the Bahr al-Ghazal) in the northern border areas of the Azande country, "massacring" the occupants and carrying off guns and ammunition. Thereupon Abu Qurun and two other zara'ib overseers organized a major expedition consisting of over 2000 people (including 300 sol- diers equipped with guns, in addition to porters and male and female slaves) against the "refractory chiefs on the northern borders" and es- pecially against Ndoruma. However, the expedition suffered a crush- ing defeat in an attack led personally by Ndoruma, which was the first occasion where the stolen firearms were put to use. Abu Qurun and many soldiers were killed, and goods, equipment, and ammuni- tion were seized.311 Schweinfurth's explanation of the hostilities initiated by Bazingbi's sons has been adopted in most historical studies, viz., that the Khartoumers had shifted the focus of their trading activities to the re- gion south of the Uele because of a decline in supplies of ivory in the northern Azande areas. The northern princes, whose territories were crossed by plundering caravans, now tried to prevent the advance of the traders and gain possession by force of goods they had formally obtained through exchange.312 According to Evans-Pritchard, defence of the trading monopoly was of lesser importance. He argued that af- ter a first phase, in which relations were set up on an equal basis by traditional means such as the exchanging of gifts, blood brotherhood, and marriage alliances, the traders began to undermine the authority of the Avungara through their demands for provisions for the cara- vans, through raids, and generally through outrageous behavior to- ward the rulers and their subjects, so that the princes no longer toler- ated their presence.313 3101m Herzen, 218, 248-49, 258-60, 278-79, 379-89, 395, 408-09, 413-14, 417- 18, 440.

But there was a con- crete reason for Ndoruma's attacks, found in the oral traditions of the Azande. We know from Schweinfurth's itineraries that the zariba de- stroyed by Ndoruma was administered by a "Niamniam slave" called "Fomboa" and that it lay in the (former?) territory of Prince "Uqueh," i.e., Ukwe, son of Yakpati.314 According to an account re- corded at the beginning of the twentieth century, Pombwa (the correct form of his name) was the son of a non-aristocratic father and an Avungara princess, sister to Ukwe's father Yakpati. He had declared himself an independent chief in a part of Ukwe's territories, and when that prince marched against him, he killed him in battle and seized power in his principality. Thereupon Ndoruma, together with his brother Ngatua, took steps against the non-Avungara and defeated him in his turn, after which Pombwa's followers scattered under the rule of Ndoruma, Ngatua, and Gbudwe.315 The two versions of these events are not irreconcilable. Pombwa had probably attracted followers as dragoman of the traders, and thanks to the firearms put at his disposal, gradually expanded his po- sition of power up to his victory over the rightful ruler Ukwe. Ndoruma's attack against Pombwa is probably what Schweinfurth re- corded as the destruction of Abu Qurun's zariba, or even the attack against the traders themselves, who, from the point of view of the Azande, were his supporters.316 The fact that Gbudwe also profited from the partition could be an indication that the events concerning Pombwa were also directly responsible for the actions of this prince against the traders, noted by Schweinfurth. Ndoruma's attack could thus be partly explained by the fact that the Khartoumers had shaken the Avungara's ancient claim to have the exclusive right of providing independent rulers, and it also fits into the policy followed by Bazingbi and his descendants of asserting their own supremacy among the other princes of Yakpati's line and of annexing their prin- cipalities.317 The hostile actions noted by Schweinfurth in no way represent co- ordinated resistance on the part of the Avungara against penetration by the traders, as is often claimed. They were based on internal politi- 3141m Herzen (1874), 2:520, and map. 31"Hutereau, Histoire des peuplades, 194-95. 316If this reconstruction is correct, Ukwe must have already been dead at the time of Schweinfurth's journey, even if Schweinfurth did not mention this explicitly and recorded Ukwe's residence on his map. 317Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Gescbichte, 283, 551, table 18.</page><page sequence="85">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 173 cal interests and were initiated by only one line of the house of Yakpati. Thus the hostility of Bazingbi's sons against cAbd al-Samad, which broke out at the time of Schweinfurth's journey, can also be ex- plained by the fact that he supported the sons of Muduba Ngangi and Surur, who belonged to a rival collateral line. The events surrounding Pombwa reveal the gap between the per- ception of certain events by European observers and the way the same events are told by the Azande. While in the case of founding a zariba in a particular area, Europeans only speak of a "conquest" on the part of the traders and "subduing" the local population, the Azande lay emphasis on the role played by their own protagonists. In their re- corded historical traditions, the northern Sudanese traders and gov- ernment representatives appear far less often than the detailed ac- counts of their "conquests" in the European sources would lead us to expect. In the latter the real situation was misjudged. The Khartoumers sought neither political nor territorial control. They es- tablished bases outside the main areas of settlement in the Bahr al- Ghazal and in the Bahr al-Jabal area to safeguard their trade routes and obtain supplies of ivory and slaves. In this they depended on the cooperation of local partners, whom they equipped with guns. In this way they became a new power factor, intervening in local politics by helping to strengthen or promote the position of their allies-whether of Avungara or non-Avungara descent. The relationship between Mu- duba's son Mbagali, alias Surur, and cAbd al-Samad should be seen in this light. By offering him military support, the trader helped the landless prince obtain territory of his own. It was not a case of a northern Sudanese "conqueror" setting up a "puppet ruler" as is fre- quently claimed, following Schweinfurth.318 However, that the presence of the traders could lead to reshaping relations that threatened the rule of the Avungara is shown by the ex- ample of a border area not normally taken into account in historical reconstructions of Avungara expansion-the area of the Aka-Dungu, which we learn about from the writings of Casati and especially of Emin. In the 1880s this region near the much-traveled trading route leading from the Bahr al-Jabal through Makaraka to eastern Monbuttu was under the control of government representatives or of the new local potentates of Monbuttu and Makaraka, including the powerful Azande chief Ringio. The Azande population was ruled by non-Avungara dragomans, who according to Emin had in many cases -38See, for instance, Mire, "AI-Zubayr," 116; Thuriaux-Hennebert, Zande, 34-35; and Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 308, 322.</page><page sequence="86">174 Paola Ivanov "usurped the power of the true chiefs like real robber barons by forc- ing them aside."319 From the names mentioned by Emin, including Bodio and Bondu, it is possible to identify the former rightful rulers as sons of Renzi, Yakpati's eldest son, who was known as a great conqueror and who had led the first Avungara expansion movement into the area of the upper Uele basin.320 Oral traditions, according to which Ndukpe, Renzi's eldest son, also advanced as far as the Dungu, confirm the ac- counts of the travelers.321 Thus, as in the example of Pombwa and Ukwe, the traders contributed to the seizing of power by non- Avungara, who succeeded in replacing the rightful rulers until the re- treat of their northern Sudanese supporters, when the sons of Wando were able to conquer the region. XIII The threat posed by the northern Sudanese to the Avungara Azande principalities was not one of complete subjugation, as was to be the case in the subsequent colonial situation. Rather it consisted in a gradual undermining of the existing system of rule through the cre- ation of alternative centers of power that took from the Avungara their political preeminence and consequently their followers. The traders became competitors of the Avungara rulers by themselves at- tracting clients and building up bodies of followers. The term "slaves" for members of the local population engaged in the service of the zara'ib is misleading with regard to the very real power exercised by the leaders of bazinqir troops and by the dragomans. Even Schweinfurth emphasized that at the end of the 1860s many volun- teers, especially from the Azande areas, were recruited into the ranks of the "slave soldiers," who were allowed to acquire wives, land, and even slaves of their own.322 However, this type of competition existed only in the regions bor- dering on the main settlement areas of the Khartoumers, where their 319Emin, Sanmmlung, 440; cf. idem, Tagebiicher, 2:432-40, 480-83; Casati, Dieci anni, 1:76-77, 222-23, 242; and the maps in Junker, Reisen, 1:plates 7 and 9. 320Calonne-Beaufaict, Azande, 60, 63; Schweinfurth, Im Herzen, 407; Junker, Reisen, 1:545.

This also explains the conflicts between the traders and the northwestern Avungara princes of Nunga's line, whose territories bordered on the big slave markets of the Bahr al- Ghazal. Thus the conflict between Tikima and al-Zubayr in 1864 was sparked by the fact that al-Zubayr had acquired a large "slave army" in the country of the prince and that Tikima was not prepared to tol- erate such a concentration of power in the hands of his son-in-law (who, for the Avungara, was a subordinate ally). Al-Zubayr, who was still at the beginning of his career, at first retreated. But after he and the other traders had consolidated their power in the western Bahr al- Ghazal and in the "Dar Banda" to the north of the Anunga territo- ries, armed conflict with Tikima and his uncle Mukpoi inevitably arose.323 The war ended with the rise to power of the Arab-friendly Zemoi and the destruction of Mukpoi's principality, which was situated clos- est to the zone of the traders, and which, at the time of the Turkiyya, was ruled, significantly enough, by non-Azande dragomans, in addi- tion to some very weak sons of the deceased prince, under the super- vision of a Nile-valley Sudanese named Katambur.324 There are even indications that several non-Azande groups, who according to the usual historical reconstruction had migrated into the western Bahr al- Ghazal to flee Avungara expansion, had originally been subjects of the Anunga rulers and left them in order to join the zara'ib. These in- cluded in particular a large number of Sere, who settled in the Bahr al-Ghazal mainly around the zariba Daym Arbab. It is worth noting that Rifaci Agha worked for this zariba, being the only trader who succeeded in setting up his own rule in the Avungara Azande territo- ries. His chief base was in the main Sere area on the upper Mbomu, and several Sere held posts as dragomans or troop leaders under him.325 Partly because they offered access to firearms, the traders held out greater opportunities for talented men to rise to power than did the Avungara princes, who were always concerned to preserve their own supremacy. Violent clashes between individual Avungara rulers and the Khartoumers can therefore be attributed to situations in which the newcomers posed a threat to the hegemony of individual rulers in their own sphere of control through their intervention in local poli- 323Martin Thilo, Ez-Ziber Rahmet Paschas Autobiographie: Ein Beitrag zur Geschicbte des Sudan (Bonn, 1921), 16-21; for an overview see Dampierre, Des ennemis, 48-50. 324Junker, Reisen, 2:143; 3:275-76, 280-81, and plate 5. 325lvanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 436-51, 525-26.</page><page sequence="88">176 Paola Ivanov tics, whether by giving support to a rival dynastic line or by setting up competing centers of power. Resistance was due to the concrete politi- cal interests of individual princes, rather than to any anachronistic de- sire for freedom or a generally hostile attitude to "the Arabs." The policies of the Avungara were directed mainly toward gaining from the presence of the new forces the greatest possible advantage in the competition with rival princes. Depending on their current political interests, the Khartoumers were either welcomed or fought off. Apart from the border areas of the Azande expansion, this policy was quite effective. As we have seen, Tikima's son Zemoi and his uncle Sasa knew how to exploit the cooperation with the traders and the Turkiyya that was imposed on them at times more or less by force, in order to achieve a considerable increase in their own power. They not only continued to rule in accordance with the old Avungara principles, they were also able to strengthen their hold on their sub- jects, which is shown in their unchallenged position of power at the time of the colonial conquest.326 The princes in Yakpati's line came to terms with the traders or fought against them, depending on what seemed most opportune in the light of the political situation. That Bazingbi's successors succeeded over quite a long period in asserting themselves against the Khartoumers and the rulers they supported shows that their military potential and the loyalty of their subjects were still great enough to produce a balance of power. Even in the time of the Turkiyya, most princes were able-after having some problematic situations to cope with (Rifaci Agha's vic- tory over Ndoruma, the conflict between the sons of Wando sparked off by cAbd Allahi's intervention)-to come to an arrangement with the various representatives of the administration and, like Zemoi, sought profitable connections. Wando and his sons came to terms with Emin and the government agents in Monbuttu; Ndoruma was allowed to keep the guns seized from the traders-and may possibly have been given even more by Gessi-and took part in the expedition against Gbudwe, who had in the meantime become his enemy.327 Thus the Avungara Azande were able to react through their political institutions to the new conditions created by the traders and to adapt themselves to the changed power relations. 326Especially Pierre Salmon, La reconnaissance Graziani chez les sultans du nord de I'Uele (1908) (Brussels, 1963); for the pre-Mahdiyya period see Junker, Reisen, 3:194-95, 352. 327Gessi, Sette anni, 382; Zaghi, Riconquista, 468; Junker, Reisen, 2:129, 224, 526-28; 3:356; Emin, Tagebficher, 2:377, 467, 471; Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 332-34; Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Gescbichte, 284-87, table 19.</page><page sequence="89">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 177 XIV Due to their anti-Islamic tendency, the European sources on which the historical reconstructions are based overestimated, in the case of the Avungara Azande, both the dominance of the traders and the extent of the political disruption caused by their presence.328 Although some individual princes or ruling lines died out, overall the Avungara hardly lost any of their territories and retained their leading role po- litically, while individual princes skilfully exploited the new condi- tions to increase their own power. Finally, the Mahdiyya also contrib- uted to the absence of serious upheavals, for attempts in the 1880s by the administration to exercise stronger control (we think of Gbudwe's capture, for example) were broken off with the retreat of the Turco- Egyptian troops. The Mahdist forces also left the Bahr al-Ghazal at the end of 1885, and the princes of Yakpati's line were left to them- selves (Gbudwe had been liberated), while the northern Avungara of Nunga's line (Zemoi and Tembura who ruled in the western Sue ba- sin) and the Abandia ruling on the Mbomu maintained a profitable connection with the Muslim north, based mainly on trade rela- tions.329 In order to make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the slave and ivory trades in the region of the Nile-Congo watershed, it would be necessary first to evaluate properly the population losses and social disruption they caused, since the existing material has not yet been subjected to a critical examination. Thus, for example, Gessi's data on the slave trade are questionable. Although they are oc- casionally used, they were motivated by the "war of liberation" which he led against the "slave traders"-or more correctly, his war, 328For the Abandia from Ndunga's line see Dampierre, Des ennemis. We should possibly exclude from this statement the Abandia territories (not taken into ac- count here) of the lines of Lezia and Kasanga, in which settlement by the traders was far advanced, but for whom we still have no adequate information. The des- tiny of the members of the third powerful ruling line of the Avungara, the descen- dants of Ndeni, was scarcely affected by the expansion of the traders, due to the marginal location of their principalities in the western Bomokandi area: cf.

Schwein- furth's figures are generally considered to be trustworthy but they too are not conclusive. One example will suffice: Schweinfurth estimated the total population of the Bongo living in the Bahr al-Ghazal at around 100,000, whereas during and after the colonial period their number was given as 5000 individuals maximum. These figures are commonly used in the literature as evidence of a dramatic population loss due to the slave trade, the turmoils during the Mahdiyya, and to some extent the conquests of the Avungara, so that the Bongo are generally thought of as a classic example of a people wiped out by foreign invasions.330 True, the modern territory of the Bongo-two main groups, established near Wau and Tong respectively-covers only a very small part of that which can be deduced from early sources, which stretched roughly from the middle Pongo to beyond the Tong/Ibba, but this is explained by the resettlements ordered by the Anglo-Egyptian government. As far as population size is concerned, the discrepancy between Schweinfurth's information and later figures (a discrepancy which is not found in the case of other peoples of the Bahr al-Ghazal who were also affected by the slave trade and the Mahdiyya) can best be explained by the fact that that Schweinfurth simply exaggerated in his estimation, which in any case has no absolute value.331 It can be proved that Schweinfurth greatly overestimated the size of the Mangbetu, to whom, as to the Bongo, he devoted a long ideologically biased description (he gives one million Mangbetu, compared with a maximum of 150,000 individuals at the height of the power of the Mangbetu).332 In the case of the Bongo, the ideological background is that Schweinfurth took them as an example of the extirpation of au- tochthonous peoples by the slave trade, speaking of a people "des- 330Schweinfurth, Im Herzen, 138; Evans-Pritchard, "Bongo," Sudan Notes and Records 12(1929), 4-5; Baxter/Butt, Azande, 130; Santandrea, Tribal History, 132-35; Kronenberg/Kronenberg, Bongo, 3-6, 58-59, 78; Ulrich BraukAmper, Mi- gration und ethnischer Wandel: Untersuchungen aus der dstlichen Sudanzone (Stuttgart, 1992), 230. 331Cf. the discrepant information on the territory and thus the population size of the Bongo in Schweinfurth, Int Herzen, 137-38. The explanation offered by the Kronenbergs is not acceptable. They suggest (Bongo, 3-7) that Schweinfurth did not distinguish the Bviri, who today live close by the Bongo, as an independent group and included them in his Bongo count. The Bviri moved close to the Bongo only during the colonial period, however, and Schweinfurth did not mention them because he did not travel through their former territory, which was south of his routes (cf. Santandrea, Tribal History, 107-30). 332Cf.

The argument was passed along unquestioned in the ethnographic literature, together with the figures for population losses which had already taken place, for which no evidence can be produced. The manner by which the figures were determined throws some light on the matter. Schweinfurth knew those Bongo who had relations with the traders and based his estimate "on the number of huts in the vil- lages surrounding the various zeribas, and on the number of porters provided by each district."333 We know that when the traders came into their country, the Bongo were organized in small groups (clans), frequently feuding with each other, and separated by extensive unin- habited tracts of land.334 On comparison, it is striking that in almost every case the names of these clans are identical to the names of the zara'ib in the Bongo country, so that we can assume that the latter were located in the different clan territories.335 Although the Bongo were scattered over a wide area in the nine- teenth century then, their population density was very low, and their settlements were concentrated only in widely separated clan territo- ries, in which the traders set up their zara'ib. By calculating his popu- lation figures for the Bongo on the basis of the population density in the areas close to the zara'ib, Schweinfurth projected the higher popu- lation concentration in the clan territories to the whole of Bongoland in an inadmissible way. Schweinfurth's exaggerated estimate is an in- dication of exactly the opposite of that which he intended, namely that the majority of the Bongo at that time were concentrated around the traders.336 The most important element for assessing the role of the traders in the region of the upper Nile and the Nile-Congo watershed is the fact that the zara'ib system established by the northern Sudanese permit- ted the local population to participate in the newly created, very dy- namic economic and political structures: it is not possible to draw a sharp line between the "oppressed local population" and the "op- pressing northern Sudanese conquerors." This applies not only to the 333Schweinfurth, Inm Herzen, 138. 334Kronenberg/Kronenberg, Bongo, 58-60, 74-79, 86. 33-Cf. the list of Bongo clans in ibid., 75-78, and the names of the zara'ib given in Schweinfurth's itineraries (Imr Herzen [1874], Appendix 2); see also Santandrea, Tribal History, 137-38. 336It should also be remembered that in the time following Schweinfurth's journey groups of Bongo were increasingly integrated into the principalities of the Avungara princes Tembura and Gbudwe, situated in the Sue basin, where they lived scattered among the other groups of the Azande complex.</page><page sequence="92">180 Paola Ivanov relatively powerful peoples such as the Avungara Azande and Abandia Azande, whose rulers were welcome allies for both traders and government representatives, but to the many smaller and weaker groups established to the north and east of the Azande as well. In the Bahr al-Ghazal and in the Bahr al-Jabal, the large zara'ib, with their mixed population of northern Sudanese and southern Sudanese of very different origins (slaves, soldiers, concubines) were the most outstanding feature of a mixed frontier society in the process of forming, and which transcended cultural and ethnic origins, in which allegiances varied depending on political interests. In general, members of the local population in this area had the opportunity to join the zara'ib system as soldiers, craftsmen, or intermediaries, and to profit from it. Many "chiefs" who entertained relations with the zara'ib were able to gain and consolidate power in an area in which political coordination scarcely existed.337 But above all the zara'ib, as new centers of power, were the point of departure of a steadily ex- panding network of relations including allied local rulers and drago- mans, each with their equally heterogeneous followers, and which helped them to gain increasing power. Especially in those areas that did not belong to the main northern Sudanese settlements and in which local partners were needed, drago- mans became integrated as leading personalities in the "Arab" power structure. If we look more closely at the history of the region, we can find many examples of supra-ethnic political units of a new type which were formed around the dragomans. One example is the Dungu area, already mentioned, where the Agambi or Ogambi, con- sidered by the Belgian colonial administration as the "ruling dynasty" of the Logo, were in reality, according to Emin's data, the descendants of one Avukaya Ojilai from the area of the upper Nacam, who in the course of the advance of the Khartoumers had assumed the leadership over indigenous Logo and Avukaya-Ojigi groups, and where Azande dragomans also ruled over other groups of Logo and OjigA.338 This development was particularly advanced in the area of the Banda and the Kresh to the north of the Azande ("Dar Banda" and "Dar Fartit"), where there were many cases of powerful dragomans whose followers came from practically all the ethnic groups in the re- gion. Here, interaction with the traders and the representatives of the administration had given rise to a local ruling class, influenced by Arab culture and in part Islamized that, like the Avungara and 337Cf. also Mire, "AI-Zubayr," 111-12. 338Emin, Tagebiicher, 2:428,433-35; cf.

A personality like Ringio, the most important ruler in Makaraka, who had dependent chiefs right into the Dungu area, can- not be dismissed as a mere henchman of the northern Sudanese; on the contrary he had equal status and was a driving power within the new order.340 The assumption of a sharp antagonism between two precisely de- finable and unchanging "cultural" or even "ethnic" entities, which is widespread among political scientists and also in ethnological publi- cations (as the heritage of colonial interpretations)-though less so in historical works-can thus not be upheld in this simple form.341 Eth- nic or cultural "origins" were less significant than the new relations. Even the most important protagonists of the Khartoum trade were not always northern Sudanese, as it might appear from a superficial view of the sources. Members of the local population were able to control wide areas from the subsidiary zara'ib, not only as dragomans but also as more or less Islamized wukala (there was no clearcut dis- tinction), and thus hold powerful positions in the trading network. Even some of the agents of the big zara'ib in the Bahr al-Ghazal were southern Sudanese slaves or clients of the owners of the big trading companies, who generally lived in Khartoum. Others, such as the powerful Rifaci Agha, were born of the union between a trader and a female slave.342 339Junker, Reisen, 3:268-80; Charles de la K6thulle de Ryhove, "Deux ann~es de residence chez le sultan Rafai: Voyage et exploration au nord du Mbomou," Bul- letin de la Sociedtd royale belge de gdographie 19(1895), 424-26, 518-21, 526-27; Santandrea, Tribal History, 201-04, 215-26, 258-61.

After the fall of the Bahr al-Ghazal members of the Sudanese sections of the Turco-Egyptian army fled from the Mahdist forces to Zemoi, whom they served as military leaders. One of them, the former sergeant Hajj cAli, became one of the most important provin- cial chiefs and advisers of the prince. "Arabs" or other immigrants from Dar Fur (the European sources seldom specified their origins more exactly) also belonged to the troops of the Avungara rulers.343 Advisers of "Arab" origin and especially fuqara (sing. faqih, a Mus- lim holyman or teacher) lived at the courts, where the latter were needed as scribes to maintain relations with the Islamic states and the Arabized potentates of the north and were especially responsible for trade.344 Followers of the Mahdi, who after his death had come into conflict with his successor, the Khalifa cAbd Allahi Muhammad, sub- mitted themselves to one of the Kresh potentates, the Islamized Chief Bandas.34s Finally, in the northwestern area of the Bahr al-Ghazal, where con- tacts with the north had existed longest, the old market centers had a cosmopolitan population very early, made up of local peoples and im- migrants from the north. Here Muslim "sultans" held power and, fol- lowing the traditions of origin of the eastern Sudanic Islamic states, the dynasty of the Feroge claimed to be descended from a "Wise 93, 467; Zaghi, Riconquista, 269n310, 293; Junker, Reisen, 3:205-06, 210; L.

The advance of the Khartoumers was not connected with any proselytizing ambi- tions (unlike the Mahdiyya, which had the unmistakable characteris- tics of a jihad, but which had no great effect on the peoples of the Bahr al-Ghazal), yet the Arab language and culture became a sign of prestige and spread among the population. The princes belonging to the dynastic line of the Anunga, like Zemoi, Sasa, Mukpoi Ngbangazegino (son of the Mukpoi removed by al-Zubayr), and Tembura, but especially the smaller potentates of the Dar Fartit and Dar Banda and their followers spoke Arabic and were-at least exter- nally-"Arabized." Arabic names were widespread, as well as many elements of the material culture of the northern Sudanese-in particu- lar luxury goods, weapons, and styles of dress. Even certain manners and forms of etiquette were adopted.348 An examination of the question of the extent to which the ex- pansion of the traders led to the spread of Islam, could help in mak- ing a more accurate assessment of the degree of integration of the population of the Mbomu and the Bahr al-Ghazal into the new power structures created by trade.349 But here too a sharp dichotomy cannot 346Ibid., 527-28; Santandrea, Tribal History, 141-89; idem, Ethno-Geography, 86- 87; Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 202-04; on the historical cliche of the "Wise Stranger" in the eastern Sudan, Peter M.

In respect of the Azande, the common opin- ion that they had undergone acculturation without Islamization, which could be attributed to their basically hostile attitude to the Khartoumers, cannot be upheld.3s0 This attitude was by no means general. Yakpati's or rather Bazingbi's descendants were more reticent toward the strangers, and were not open to Islamic influences because in their areas the connections to the north were far less advanced than in the Mbomu area. Conversely, the Anunga and Abandia princes and their notables, who had connections with the north, although the adaptation of ex- ternal, prestigious cultural traits was the major object of interest, seem to have adopted some Islamic elements in ritual practice, such as observing the holy month of Ramadan and wearing of Islamic amu- lets in addition to traditional ones. The princes can certainly not be described as converted in the conventional sense, and in the field of magico-religious ideas and practices, primary importance was still at- tributed to witchcraft and the oracles.3s5 But the eclectic adoption of selected elements of the Islamic cult corresponds to the processes of ritual syncretism and incipient Islamization elsewhere in Africa. Inter- pretations claiming that the Islamic ritual offered alternative legitima- tion to those who were increasingly involved in the commercial economy, or that the new religion spread through the clients and slaves of the traders and raiders established in the country, can be ap- plied to the potentates north of the Azande, who had risen to power as dragomans, and who defined themselves as Muslims.352 However, this is not applicable to the Anunga princes, whose "traditional" le- gitimation was unbroken.353 It is often emphasized that the Avungara had a certain indifference toward foreign forms of culture, as far as 3SOIbid., 187, 191. 35Ila Kethulle "Deux ann~es," 406-07, 417-18, 540; Bonnel de M6ziires, Rapport, 34; Franz Xaver Geyer, Durch Sand, Sumpf und Wald.

Information given by European observ- ers (mostly colonial officers) on the question of whether the Avungara rulers were influenced by Islam is, however, problematical since there was a tendency, depend- ing on political interests, to deny any Islamic influence in the case of friendly princes, and to exaggerate it in the case of hostile ones. 352Jonathon Glassman, Feasts and Riot: Revelry, Rebellion, and Popular Con- sciousness on the Swabili Coast, 1856-1888 (Portsmouth, 1994), 134-35; Levtzion, "Slavery and Islamization," 189-93. 353These interpretations can perhaps be applied to the-not legitimate-Chief Ringio, who observed the daily prayers (Junker, Reisen, 2:543).</page><page sequence="97">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 185 their essential values and institutions were concerned.354 This can be attributed to the position of power which the princes were able to maintain in their relations with the traders, or to regain through po- litical skill, and which probably also prevented any tendencies to overadaptation. On the other hand, it is impossible to deny an in- creasing orientation toward the symbols of the Islamic culture, and the influence of the fuqara established at the courts must not be understimated. The Avungara and Abandia territories, as the terminal point of the trade, were still on the outer periphery of the Islamic commercial network at the end of the century. The question arises whether, if this development had not been in- terrupted by colonization, their greater involvement in the economy and the increase of their power within the Islamic Bilad al-Sudan would not also have found cultural expression. In the case of the Abandia Azande and Avungara Azande of the Mbomu we see the be- ginnings of an Islamization connected with trade, which did not in- volve disruption of the local societies, but which should be under- stood as a rapprochement on the part of organizations that had re- mained relatively stable to Islamic religion as a cultural system which offered access to a wider commercial and cultural world. The processes of cultural, social, and ethnic change set in motion by economic and political factors in the nineteenth century at the boundary between the Islamic area and the "pagan" south, were halted only by colonization and were in part reversed through the "southern policy." The "Arab-indigene" divide was propagated espe- cially by the Anglo-Egyptian and the Belgian colonial administrations. The "history" of the slave raids was for decades part of the syllabus of schools run by missionary societies in the southern Sudan and Bel- gian Congo, so that some feedback of European and Christian in- terpretations on present-day statements by members of the peoples who were involved at the time can be assumed. XVI With the colonial conquest we come to the period in which stereo- typed perceptions of the Azande were most highly developed and ideologically instrumentalized. The course of the European occupa- tion of Azandeland can be divided into two phases.3ss In the first 354See also Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 34, 42-43, 289-90.

The scramble was particularly fierce in this area, since the upper Nile was coveted by all powers active in the region. The main goal of Leopold II's Congo Free State, and then also of France, after gaining the territories north of the Mbomu in 1894, was to secure the Bahr al-Ghazal and the upper Nile basin against the Egyptian Protectorate power of Great Britain, which was prevented from expanding southward until the victory over the Mahdist state (1898). Several colonial expeditions were sent out in order to occupy the lands as far as the upper Nile as quickly as possible. In the Azande re- gion, which had to be traversed to get to the river, "occupation" con- sisted mainly in forming alliances with the most important Avungara or Abandia rulers. Protectorate agreements were concluded and posts set up in their territories. The authority of the princes was not ques- tioned; on the contrary, the occupiers, who were inferior in numbers, needed their cooperation for feeding their troops, transporting their equipment, and even for military purposes. The most important local allies were rewarded with valuable gifts and guns (partly in exchange for ivory). Thus at first the colonial expansion was hardly distinguish- able from the preceding activities of the Khartoum traders or the agents of the Turco-Egyptian administration, and in fact the Europe- ans with their many modern weapons were usually welcomed as pow- erful new allies. The rulers of the Mbomu basin, known in the Arab fashion as "sultans" (the Abandia Bangasu and Rafai, and the Avungara Zemoi), first allied themselves with the Congo State and after 1894 with France, and like Tembura, who ruled east of the watershed, offered help on a gigantic scale to assist the progress of Marchand's expe- dition. In the Uele area, the Matchaga Yangala (the "Niangara" of the Belgians) and old Wando with his sons also immediately agreed to the protectorate of the Congo State. But the most important contribution to the occupation of the Uele was made by Zemoi, who accompanied the Van Kerckhoven expedition as far the Nile, with 600 soldiers and 500 porters. It was his troops who saved the expedition from disaster in the Dungu basin, supporting it against the Mahdist forces estab- lished there and against the resistance of the local population.3s6 Hennebert, Zande, 195-291; Marc Michel, La mission Marchand, 1895-1899 (Paris, 1972).

The princes' policy of exploiting the presence of foreign powers to their own advantage was now doomed to failure, and the colonial conquest ended by destroying the power of the Avungara. The available sources from this period of colonial occupation come mainly from the officers who served during the conquest. Their re- ports were mainly concerned with the progress of colonial expansion, and largely contain important information about the extension of the territories of individual princes and their relation to the colonial pow- ers.357 Since the occupation did not at first interfere with the existing political system, they are also of general value for a study of preco- lonial society. However, the European colonizers were frequently moved from post to post, and suffered hard living conditions. They had to "conquer" or "administer" extensive areas and peoples of whom they knew hardly anything, and as a result their reports give us only sketchy insights into the local cultures. Information about the political organization is on the whole rare, and other topics are hardly touched on. The authors had recourse to the conceptions of the early travelers; in particular the descriptions given by Schweinfurth, Junker, and Casati (Emin's publications were less well-known) provided a gener- ally accepted basis for the image of the Azande and Mangbetu trans- mitted by the colonizers. Even though some works in the style of the precolonial travel accounts did give more space to ethnographic de- scriptions and contained useful details concerning the material culture and the economy, the authors gave only restricted attention to other 357Cf. especially Van de Vliet, "L'exploration de I'Uelle: De Djabbir ' Suruangu," Congo Illustre 3(1894), 114-17, 121-25, 131-35, 140-43, 147-50, 164-67, 172- 75; la Kethulle, "Deux ann'es," and the notes of Van Kerckhoven, who died in the course of the expedition, but whose records are summarized in the anonymous ar- ticle "L'expedition Vankerckhoven," Belgique coloniale 2(1896), 18-20, 27-28, 35-36, 47-49, 59-60, 71-72; 3(1897), 2-4, 15-16, 27-28, 39-40, 51-52, 63-64, 86- 88, 99-100, 111-12, 123-24, 134-36, 146-48.

Thus it is possible to detect a trans- formation in perceptions of the Azande, and especially of the Avungara rulers, according to the progress of colonial control (or claims to control). During the first phase of occupation, the officers of the Congo Free State in particular, and in some cases the French, wrote enthusiastic descriptions of the friendly princes. In particular, they put the idea of African despotism, together with militarism, in a positive light, and praised the great authority and skilled government of the rulers, and the military discipline of their troops (which of course were often em- ployed as auxiliary troops). Early travelers continued to understand the "natural" authority and "nobility" of the rulers in an exotic sense, as linked to their "savagery."362 Now, however, the main allies, Zemoi and Rafai, were described as complete "gentlemen," full of "distinction," whose spiritual greatness, intelligence, and "progressive attitude" (sc. their readiness to collaborate) were emphasized, and their human qualities aroused feelings of attachment, especially in the 3'8For instance la Kethulle, "Deux annies;" Enrico Craffen and Edoardo Co- lombo, "Les Niam-Niam," Revue Internationale de Sociologie 11(1906), 769- 800; Fernand Nys, Chez les Abarambo (Anvers, 1896). See also the work of C. Van Overbergh and E. De Jonghe, eds., Les Mangbetiu (Congo beige) (Brussels, 1909), in which the ethnographic observations of the Congo State officers were collected and the Azande are taken into account. Probably the most complete source concerning the organization of the "sultanates" of the Mbomu in the early period of the colonial conquest is the Rapport sur le Haut-Oubangui, le M'Bomnou et le Bahr-el-Ghazal by Bonnel de Mezieres, the leader of a French commercial mission lasting about one year which explored the possibilities of economic ex- ploitation of the region. 3s9E.g., Guy Burrows, The Land of the Pygmies (London, 1898).

The colonial forces of the Congo Free State and France encouraged or initiated increased expansionist activity among the friendly princes, since their territorial expansion automatically led to expansion of the colonial possessions.364 Several rulers rose to un- precedented heights through their connection with the conquerors. With weapons supplied by the Congo, and possibly also by France, their main allies, the Abandia rulers of the Mbomu and Zemoi formed rifle troops numbering several thousand men.365 It was only during this period that the Abandia Bangasu and Rafai were able to suppress the chronic insubordination of provincial rulers belonging to collateral lineages, and set up centralized "kingdoms."366 The Congo State and the French administration gave Rafai control over the Banda and Kresh regions on the upper Chinko. The potentates al- ready established there resisted his attacks for a long time, and some finally left the region for the Bahr al-Ghazal.367 363E.g., Milz in Van de Vliet, "Exploration de I'Uelle," 134n1; la Kethulle, "Deux annies," 404, 419, 513, 541-42; "Expedition Vankerckhoven," La Belgique coloniale 2(1896), 59; Bonnel de Mezieres, Rapport, 21-23, 34-35, 99; and the re- marks made by the first British officers who made contact with the friendly prince Tembura, in Edward Gleichen, ed., The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan: A Compendium Prepared by Officers of the Sudan Government (2 vols.: London, 1905), 1:161. It is striking that more mixed opinions, and in the course of time even negative ones, were expressed with regard to the Abandia Bangasu, who collaborated, but al- ways with an eye to his own independence, and that princes like Wando and his sons, who in their alliance with the colonial forces obviously only followed the aim of expanding their own conquests, tended rather to arouse mistrust and dis- like: cf. Dampierre, Ancien royaume, 459-60; "Expedition Vankerckhoven," Belgique coloniale 3(1897), 87. 364This policy was explicitly formulated only by Van Kerckhoven, "Expedition Vankerckhoven," La Belgique coloniale 3(1897), 99, and la Kethulle, quoted in Lotar, Grande chronique du Bomu, 34. 36See, among others, the French administrator Liotard in Michel, Mission Marchand, 175; Bonnel de Mezieres, Rapport, 16, 19, 22; Dampierre, Ancien royaume, 466, 476; Salmon, Reconnaissance Graziani, 76. The subject of weap- ons supplies was usually omitted in the writings of the officers of the Congo, so that relevant information is mostly found in French sources dating after the terri- tories of the princes north of the Mbomu had been taken over by France. For a detailed discussion of the question (including weapons supplied by the French), see Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 153-54. 366Bonnel de Mezibres, Rapport, 16-20, 102-3; Dampierre, Ancien royaume, 409, 463-72. 3671a Kethulle, "Deux annbes," 426-28; Bonnel de Mezieres, Rapport, 99; Santandrea, Tribal History, 199-200, 204, 215-16, 226-27, 248-49, 252, 258-60, 269-70; Dampierre, Ancien royaume, 104-05.</page><page sequence="103">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 191 Zemoi, on the other hand, laid claim to the Bahr al-Ghazal, against Congo and France, having been recognized as its mudir (governor) by Van Kerckhoven. Although his expansion plans were brought to noth- ing by European diplomacy-the region on the other side of the wa- tershed was given to the Sudan-he was still able to expand his rule to the north, and a large-scale military expedition which, according to accounts by the peoples affected, he sent into the western Bahr al- Ghazal, is probably connected with them.368 Other Avungara too, saw the alliance with the Europeans as an opportunity to undertake campaigns against other princes or neighboring groups. Thus it was no coincidence that Tembura's agreement to accompany Marchand's expedition to the river Jur coincided with a raid by the prince in this area.369 These military operations cannot, therefore, be attributed to the quasi-"natural" expansionist drive of the Azande, as many au- thors claim, but to a sub-imperialism engendered by the colonial con- quest. Since the colonial officers, most of whom had little knowledge of the past and the political and ethnic divisions of the areas they vis- ited, readily accepted these completely new territorial claims by the allied princes, and encouraged further expansion without making any express mention of these facts, their statements concerning the territo- rial and political situation must be treated with caution, and carefully checked against the whole of the existing data.370 The consolidation of colonial occupation led to a shift of focus as early as the end of the nineteenth century. The expansive character of Avungara politics, which had previously been appreciated and encour- aged, now served, especially in the Congo Free State, as justification for colonization. European observers painted a picture of Avungara expansion as an amazing, unrelenting process of military conquest, which could be stopped only by the "civilising white man."371 A new stereotype was formed, according to which only the intervention of 6"Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 156-57, 434-35, 449-50.

Thuriaux-Hennebert, Zande, 224), although this is clearly contradicted by Junker's precise information (Reisen, 3:256-80, and plate 5). See also the maps in Bonnel de Meziere, Rapport, and in Mecklenburg, Vonm Kongo zurn Niger und Nil, 1, which were based on the territorial divisions of the French colonial administration and in which the size of the "sultanates" is patently exaggerated. 371Burrows, Land of the Pygmies, 76.</page><page sequence="104">192 Paola Ivanov the Europeans had "saved" the still independent neighbors of the Azande, including the culturally advanced Mangbetu, from conquest by this militarily superior people, thus protecting them from "oppres- sion"-and in the case of the Mangbetu from ultimate decline.372 This idea of the unstoppable military expansion of the Azande in- fluenced western perceptions of the Azande up to and including the writings of Evans-Pritchard and beyond.373 In reality, the Avungara had never seriously threatened the rule of the Mangbetu (rather, the only significant conquests in the Mangbetu region had been carried out by the sons of Wando, in the early occupation period, with the approval of Van Kerckhoven) and even non-centralized peoples such as the Bua, who had an effective, segmentary organization which en- sured cohesion, had been able successfully to resist being taken over by the Avungara.374 The struggle of the colonial powers to gain effective control over their all too powerful former allies and their territories finally resulted in a complete change in perceptions of the Avungara. The Azande ste- reotypes were used, especially by Belgian colonial officers, as an ideo- logical means of demonstrating the neccessity of drastically reducing the power of the Avungara rulers, and as a justification for their re- pressive measures. They now talk of barbaric despotism, accompa- nied by every kind of vice-homosexuality, incest, and--of course- cannibalism. The foreign peoples integrated in the principalities were described as the victims of unscrupulous exploitation, who needed to be freed from the yoke of foreign rule and from "slavery." A real smear campaign was stirred up against the most powerful princes of the Congo-Zemoi, so highly esteemed by the early offi- cers, Sasa, and Mukpoi Ngbangazegino.375 The reports of the colonial officers exaggerated the military might and warlike nature of the Azande, and thus also the threat posed by the "rebellious" princes, i.e., those who still retained a certain measure of autonomy. The fear 372Craffen/Colombo, "Niam-Niam," 784; Van Overbergh/De Jonghe, Mangbetu, 447-48, 529.

The soldiers captured his residence and wounded him fatally while attempting to capture him.377 In reality this campaign was motivated by the desire to occupy Gbudwe's strategically important territories without delay, in order to gain an advantage in the competition with Leopold for the upper Nile basin. The habit of falling back on theories of conspiracy to justify the removal of rulers who were in the way culminated in 1916 in a concerted military action by all three colonial powers against Mukpoi Ngbangazegino, who had fled into French colonial territory. The last unsubdued ruler, he was captured and shot "while trying to es- cape."378 This campaign was justified by the claim that his "imminent revolt" made a general uprising of the Azande likely in the border area between the Sudan, Belgian Congo, and French Equatorial Af- rica. Shortly before this, within the framework of these general theories of conspiracy, several of Gbudwe's sons had been accused of prepar- ing an attack against the Sudanese garrison in Yambio, and had been arrested and deported.379 Thus the era of independent Avungara rule came to an end. Almost all the important precolonial rulers who had not died of old age, and their most powerful sons, had been killed during the conquest or removed from office, usually by force. Their territories had been divided up among various "chefs" or "chiefs" who were dependent on the colonial administrations. Only in French Equatorial Africa did the "sultans" remain on their thrones, but step by step their territories were placed under direct administration, and fully so after their death (in the case of Zemoi in 1912). Nevertheless, from 1910 to 1920 all colonial governments constantly professed to 376Zemoi had moved into French colonial territory shortly beforehand.

Historical reconstructions which retain the colonial argument of organized active resistance and large-scale rebel- lions by the Avungara against the colonial governments must be re- jected.381 None of the precolonial rulers surrendered his power volun- tarily, but in the face of the technical and military superiority of the colonial powers, and their heavy military repression, the traditional political system was powerless. On the whole, the rulers restricted themselves to passive resistance by trying as far as possible to evade the claims to control of the colo- nial powers or, if the colonial troops penetrated their territories, to minor attacks, the futility of which they were no doubt well aware.382 In the first phase of colonial expansion, some princes did lead attacks, in several cases successfully, especially against the troops of the Congo. But most of these conflicts can be explained by the alliances formed by the colonial powers with their Avungara rivals.383 In this phase, neither collaboration nor hostility on the part of the princes should be seen as a reaction to the colonial conquest. At this time, there was no question of surrendering their sovereignty to the colonial powers, nor could the Avungara foresee that this was to come. XVII The transformation that research on Africa underwent as a result of colonization can already be seen in scholarly writings on the region dating from the period following the turn of the century. The work of research was no longer entirely left to "travelers:" instead specialists in different disciplines carried out studies related to their particular fields. The works of the scientists who were allowed access to the Azande and Mangbetu territories as members of several large scien- 380Reining, Zande Scheme, 17; Collins, Land beyond the Rivers, 126-27, 250; Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 163-66. 381E.g., Salmon, Reconnaissance Graziani; idem., Derni're insurrection; and Collins, Land beyond the Rivers. 382lvanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 160-61, 176-77; Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 394. 38I1bid., 377-88; Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 159, and sources cited there.</page><page sequence="107">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 195 tific expeditions as soon as the region had been sufficiently "paci- fied," tended to contain only scant and superficial information con- cerning the inhabitants of the areas they traveled through.384 Of great significance for ethnographic research in the Uele region were two in- terdisciplinary expeditions organized by Duke Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburg. In the course of the first "German Central Africa Expe- dition" (1907/08), which traveled from the Interlacustrine region over the Ituri to the Congo river, the Polish anthropologist, Jan Czekanowski, who was sent out by the Konigliches Museum fiir V61- kerkunde in Berlin, also made anthropological and ethnographic ob- servations in the Uele region.385 Two members of the second expedition (1910/11), which was actu- ally centered on the region of the river Chari and Lake Chad, crossed the country of the Azande during their return journey. The officer Walther von Wiese und Kaiserwaldau, who had previously served in German East Africa, traveled through the "sultanates" of the Mbomu as far as the Bahr al-Ghazal. His report of the expedition corresponds to the genre of the travel account and contains much information about the peoples of the region.386 The zoologist Hermann Schubotz, on the other hand, who advanced along the Uele and through the Dungu valley to the Bahr al-Jabal, only devoted a long description to the Mangbetu, which is clearly influenced by the writings of Schweinfurth.387 Most importantly, the colonial conquest marked the beginning of research in the region of the Nile-Congo watershed in accordance with the principles of anthropology, which was now firmly estab- lished as an academic discipline. It was mainly supported by the colo- nial governments, which needed to develop guidelines for the admin- istration of the local populations. The fundamental ethnographic and historical studies of the Azande were carried out between 1900 and 1930, and our present-day knowledge is still essentially based on them. 384E.g., Boyd Alexander, From the Niger to the Nile (2 vols.: London, 1907).

Calonne-Beaufaict had entered the Congo Free State service as an engineer, and from 1905 to his death in 1915 he worked at first in the Bua region and later among the Azande. Calonne-Beaufaict was an enthusiastic and talented anthropologist. A follower of Durkheim, he was also familiar with other anthropological schools of his time.392 He rejected the nineteenth-century notion that the Azande were a homogeneous 388Notes sur la vie fainiliale et juridique de quelques populations du Congo belge (Brussels, 1909). 389(Brussels, 1922). 390Cf.

How much and what information he obtained in this way is not known. 391The inaccuracies in Hutereau's and also de Calonne-Beaufaict's reconstructions based on oral data become evident in cases where the accounts of earlier travelers contain eyewitness reports of the same events and in the (few) cases where more detailed reconstructions have been made using the local historical tradition: e.g., Santandrea, who included in his Tribal History the relations between the Bahr al- Ghazal peoples and the northern Avungara principalities; Evans-Pritchard's recon- struction of the history of the principality of Gbudwe; and B.

With these facts in mind, he attempted the extremely difficult task of linking the dynastic history of the Avungara with a historical study of the individual groups composing the Azande clus- ter. Calonne-Beaufaict died before he could complete his work, and a large part of his notes was lost. The historical part, which was pre- served, was published by Bertrand with an introduction outlining the main features of the expansion process of the Avungara Azande, un- der the title Les Azande: Introduction a une ethnographie generale des Bassins de l'Ubangi-Uele et de l'Aruwimi.393 As we shall see, Calonne-Beaufaict's historical reconstructions have in many respects lost their validity, but it remains that we are indebted to him for drawing attention to the dynamics of assimilation in Azande society- he spoke of a "mecanisme sociologique de l'azandeisation"394-and for creating the foundation on which all subsequent scholars have premised their studies of the Azande cluster. The second volume of Jan Czekanowski's work on the peoples of the region between the Nile and the Congo, which is completed by a volume containing his own photographs, contains extensive informa- tion about the Azande and their neighbors.395 In addition to his own observations and information obtained from colonial officers, Czekanowski also used the most important information that had ap- peared to write a comprehensive ethnographic description of every important group in the region. The execution of this gigantic ethnographic project not only took a very long time, but, due to the limited duration of the large-scale expedition, Czekanowski was un- able to investigate thoroughly the culture and society of the many peoples which he included in his book. His observations on external aspects of their culture are therefore more reliable than his treatment of historical and sociopolitical questions. 393(Brussels, 1921). 394Cf.

Occa- sionally, he added information taken from the rest of the literature or supplemented Hutereau's account with details from his own re- searches. Since he did not always distinguish his own data from Hutereau's, it is sometimes unclear from which source the informa- tion came.396 In particular, his information concerning the history of the small groups in the Uele region that were integrated into the Azande and Mangbetu cluster, reflected the inadequateness of histori- cal research at that time, and, like his hypotheses regarding the ethnic divisions in the region before the Avungara Azande expansion and re- garding subsequent migrations, should on no account be taken as a reliable version of the facts. Other works on the Azande are of a purely ethnographic nature. For instance, there were the detailed articles, organized under ethno- graphic rubrics, of Major P. M. Larken, who as District Commis- sioner for Sudanese Azandeland from 1911 to 1932 earned himself the nickname of "King" Larken.397 The Dominican friar Mgr. C. R. Lagae, who lived in the region of the upper Uele from 1917, compiled a monograph.398 Lagae and another Dominican friar, V. H. Vanden Plas, who had settled in the region before him, also wrote a dictionary which is an inexhaustible source of information on the culture and society of the Azande.399 In imitation of the researches of de Calonne- Beaufaict, whom he knew personally, Vanden Plas also showed an in- terest in the early history of the Uele region, and in the introduction to the dictionary he gave a short but precise overview of the groups integrated in the Azande cluster.400 Finally, the work of E.E.

In the course of three field trips be- tween 1926 and 1930, he spent a total of twenty months, mainly among the Azande in the south of the then Yambio District. His re- search area thus essentially covered the western half of the old princi- pality of Gbudwe ("Yambio") and excluded the large provinces to the east of the Sue, which were governed by his sons, Rikita and Mange.401 Evans-Pritchard's researches were commissioned by the government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, which undertook to pay the greater part of the expenses. The increased support given to eth- nographic research by Khartoum in the period between the two world wars is connected with the introduction of indirect rule during the 1920s. Evans-Pritchard's teacher, C. G. Seligman, as Government An- thropologist, was commissioned to carry out a comprehensive ethno- graphic survey of the Sudan.402 Evans-Pritchard himself conducted inquiries among the Azande and several other groups in accordance with current ethnographic models, the results of which were utilized by C. G. and B. C. Seligman in their book Pagan Tribes of the Nilotic Sudan.403 Evans-Pritchard also published several short ethnographic accounts of different groups.404 But with his fundamental work, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande, he broke with the genre of the ethno- graphic account in order to concentrate on one selected aspect of the Azande culture and its social and cultural logic.40s From the mid- 1950s onward Evans-Pritchard also devoted himself to the study of the precolonial political history of the Avungara Azande in a series of articles which he collected in his book The Azande: History and Political Institutions shortly before his death. In addition to the results of his own field research, Evans-Pritchard used all the older sources for his historical investigation of Azande so- ciety; in particular, he was the first scholar to submit the accounts of 4010n the territorial divisions within Gbudwe's principality see Evans-Pritchard, Azande, 123-30, and Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, table 19 and map 11. 402Grandin, Soudan nilotique, 217-21; Evans-Pritchard, "Ethnological Survey of the Sudan" in J.

He summarized the results of his re- searches in his Huxley Memorial Lecture, given in 1963, in a concise characterization of the essential elements of the political organization of the Azande.407 XVIII In accordance with the scholarly premises on which their works are based, the authors in the colonial period generally aimed for objec- tivity in their writings, so that the picture they painted of the Azande is a considerably more balanced one than that spread by the early travelers and by the colonial officers involved in the conquest. And all of them strove, albeit to different degrees, to understand the peoples they described-whether in order to be able to govern or missionize them better or, as Clifford Geertz appropriately characterizes the tex- tual strategy of the works of Evans-Pritchard, with the aim of trans- forming apparently strange phenomena into ones that are familiar (to the English educated public), thus bringing Africans "into a world conceived in deeply English terms, and confirming thereby the domin- ion of those terms."40s Open deprecation is therefore less common. Nevertheless, the old perceptions of the Azande still survive. Almost all the known cliches turn up-in a variety of new forms- in the writings of one scholar or the other. The selection made by the individual observers within the framework of available topics is in part determined by their position.409 Thus it is not surprising that "King" Larken-de facto supreme ruler of Sudanese Azandeland, where there were no paramount chiefs-who had spent the first years of the colonial administration in suppressing the alleged Avungara "conspiracies," described the former power of the Avungara rulers as 406"Sources" and "Zande Cannibalism." 407"Zande State." 408Works and Lives, The Anthropologist as Author (Stanford, 1988), 70. 409And with the extent of their intellectual agility: thus de Calonne-Beaufaict, con- sidered in the light of the mentality of his time, can be described as the observer freest of prejudice.</page><page sequence="113">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 201 "limitless" and cruel, and saw their expansion (the course of which, incidentally, he did not know the details of) as an unstoppable series of military conquests.410 Hutereau still emphasized the militarism of the Azande. He believed that colonization ended a state of "anarchy" and permanent struggle for predominance-that the Avungara and the Abandia had emerged from this struggle as victorious dynasties, while the Mangbetu had been "decimated" and had had to forfeit all their earlier conquests.411 In the course of his historical reconstruction, however, Hutereau did present a more differentiated view of the expansion of the Avungara, and also emphasized the peaceful methods they used in in- tegrating foreign groups.412 According to Czekanowski the Azande were only able to conquer such extensive territories thanks to their "military ability" and "inner discipline." Following prevalent opin- ion, he emphasized that the Avungara princes were filled with "pride of rank" and considered their Azande subjects "as their slaves." This overestimation of, as he put it, the "exclusivity" of the ruling houses led him to the mistaken belief that only children born of endogamous marriages were "fully entitled" Avungara (in actual fact the mothers of the Avungara rulers were usually commoners).413 Like de Calonne-Beaufaict, the other scholars considered here- Bertrand, Vanden Plas, Lagae, and later Evans-Pritchard-did not stress the warlike aspect of the Avungara Azande policy so much as its assimilatory or, as it were, "colonial" or "imperialistic" character.414 Now that the Avungara had ceased their conquering activities, they received sympathy and recognition from their new rulers. Through their expansion, the sociopolitical fragmentation that was typical of the region, and annoying for the establishment of colonial control, had been replaced by a homogeneous whole which could be more eas- ily governed, only providing the princes could be forced into the ser- vice of the administration. Bertrand already made remarks to this ef- fect, although he was also still concerned with the necessity of "chan- neling" the power of the Avungara within the limits fixed by "western civilization."415 In particular, Evans-Pritchard, who was familiar with 410)"Account," 21-24. 411Notes, 45; Histoire des peuplades, 12. 412E.g., ibid., 151-52, 156-57. 413Ethnographie, 49-50. 414Bertrand in de Calonne-Beaufaict, Azande, xxiv-xxx; Vanden Plas, "Introduc- tion," 57; Hutereau, Histoire des peuplades, 226; Lagae, Azande, 27-28; Evans- Pritchard, "Zande State," 106-07; idem, Azande, 22, 43. 41SBertrand in de Calonne-Beaufaict, Azande, xxix-xxx.</page><page sequence="114">202 Paola Ivanov the problems caused by the introduction of indirect rule among the countless small groups of the Sudan, appreciated the assimilation pro- cess carried out by the Avungara Azande and positively supported the integration of their "organized and efficient administration" in the colonial administration.416 Thus these notions reflected the abstract models and the practice of the colonial administrations, as also implied in the theoretical ethno- graphic/anthropological paradigms which became accepted early in the colonial period, and which were embodied in the prevalent liter- ary genre of the ethnographic account.417 Of the sources examined here, the works of Larken, Lagae, and Czekanowski belong to this genre. Although Evans-Pritchard broke with the tradition of the eth- nographic description, he continued to accept the premises on which it was based. The object of investigation was the "traditional" society and culture of a "tribe" understood as a unit. The description, influ- enced by the natural sciences and aiming at classification, reflected the outline of the underlying questionnaires and had to be imper- sonal. The cultural and social features described were considered a priori as applicable to the whole "tribe," with the result that indi- vidual observations were generalized and the context in which they were made was omitted.418 These premises involve a number of prob- lems, especially in the case of the Azande, and are combined with the continued influence of stereotyped perceptions in a way that is highly obstructive to research. XIX Between 1900 and 1930 the colonial conquest was still recent enough for scholars to be able to describe the "traditional," i.e., precolonial, situation from their own observations or by questioning contempo- rary witnesses. It is to Evans-Pritchard that we owe a number of valu- able accounts, collected from Gbudwe's former courtiers, showing the ways in which the principality was organized. Nevertheless, the his- tory of the Azande was deliberately ignored in the descriptions. The observers did not mention either the changes resulting from coloniza- tion or those brought about by trade and the Turco-Egyptian regime. A typical description is that of Larken, who spoke throughout of "the Zande" in the ethnographic present, giving the impression of a time- 416Azande, 43. 417Jan Vansina, "The Ethnographic Account as a Genre in Central Africa" in Heintze/Jones, European Sources, 433-44. 4'sIbid., 434-39.</page><page sequence="115">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 203 less people cut off from any contact with the outside world. If, for ex- ample, the traditional barkcloth clothing worn by the Azande men was described, it was left unmentioned that since the earliest contacts with the Khartoum traders, cotton fabrics and Arab clothing, and later European clothing, were preferred.419 Czekanowski did admit this fact, but only after describing in detail what "the Azande" "usu- ally" wear-namely, barkcloth.420 Descriptions of political organization are the only ones which re- ferred explicitly to the past, but they did not take into account how the position of the princes had changed. Even Evans-Pritchard, who described in detail in "The Zande State" those fields where the power of the princes had been restricted, added: "However, if much had gone, much remained, sufficient to enable one to observe directly the traditional system, even if in partial decay, for in the area in which I did my research administration had been slight till a few years be- fore."421 This assessment neglected the fact that in the Anglo-Egyp- tian Sudan, after the power of the Avungara had previously been con- sistently suppressed, selected princes were deliberately "reinstated" in 1923 as part of the creation of the Native Administration, and given responsibility for some of the administrative and judicative functions under the control of the colonial administration.422 But the rule of the Avungara was based on a complex system of followers and clients, in which individuals were not simply appointed to "offices" involving power per se, in the way envisaged by the colonial administrations, but where positions of power were gained through skilful political ac- tion. Every prince-the supreme ruler of a principality and his depen- dent relatives who ruled over parts of the territory (referred to by Evans-Pritchard as provincial governors)-based his power not, as Evans-Pritchard put it, on district deputies delegated by himself, but on a network of clients who were under obligation to him and who attended at his court. These were themselves "big men" (bakumba) or patrons with relatives, either affinal or consanguineal, friends, and various clients or dependents grouped around them. Like the princes themselves, these bakumba had troops of unmarried warriors (aparanga) and could be at the head of a further network of sub- patrons. In addition to the redistribution system emphasized by Evans-Pritchard, the princes increased their body of followers and gained prestige through matrimonial alliances and the asymmetric 4t9Larken, "Account," 34-35. 420Ethnographie, 32-33. 421"Zande State," 102-03. 422 Reining, Zande Scheme, 17-27; Collins, Shadows, 320-23.</page><page sequence="116">204 Paola Ivanov type of marriage in accordance with the principles of delayed ex- change, blood brotherhood, and the granting of asylum to strangers, but also the forced settlement or enslavement of prisoners of war.423 This organization could not survive colonization, in which there was no room for genuine political power with all its implications- such as competition and the existence of independent statuses-in the hands of Africans.424 For the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan it has been shown that the control and penal authority of the Avungara was felt as increasingly oppressive by their subjects, as the real power was now no longer in their hands and the reciprocity of the patron-client relationship had been lost.425 The transformation by the colonial ad- ministrations of this informal political system based on building up client networks into a hierarchical structure of chiefs and subchiefs considerably affected research into the dynamics of the Avungara ex- pansion. This can be seen in Evans-Pritchard's analyses. Although he strove to reconstruct the system in which power was tied to the per- son of the prince and based on redistribution and exchange of services between ruler and followers, in the end he reduced the dynamics of Avungara politics to a formalistic, pyramidal arrangement of "of- fices," even while recognizing that this was sanctioned by the subjects and therefore not despotic. To this must be added a theoretical aspect: since the Avungara principalities did not correspond to either of the two basic forms of "primitive" society recognized by the colonial administrations and by anthropology, one based on kinship and the other on territorial bonds, all scholars had difficulty in understanding the Avungara ex- pansion.426 Even those studies which stressed its assimilationist as- pects only emphasized the "superiority" of the political system of the Avungara Azande, which made possible the effective integration of conquered peoples.427 It was more or less explicitly assumed that mili- 423Reining, Zande Scheme, 12-38, 99-101; Ivanov, Vorkoloniale Geschichte, 573- 87. 424Vansina, Paths, 246; Terence Ranger, "The Invention of Tradition Revisited: The Case of Colonial Africa" in idem and Olufemi Vaughan, eds., Legitimacy and the State in Twentieth-Century Africa (Houndmills, 1993), 73-74. 42ZReining, Zande Scheme, 27-38; Collins, Shadows, 324. 426As Adam Kuper shows, the distinction between gentile and territorial organiza- tions, created by evolutionist anthropology in the nineteenth century, has entered into the later lineage theory essentially unchanged: "Lineage Theory: A Critical Retrospect," Annual Review of Anthropology 11(1982), 71-95.

In the end, this attempt to explain the origin of the power of the Avungara in military terms reflected the dichotomy between gentile and territorial organizations. It reproduced those "superimposition" theories that attribute the transition from "primitive" kinship organi- zation to the "higher" organization system based on territory to con- quest by a foreign group (usually "superior" pastoralists, such as the Hamites, but also hunters) which succeeded in asserting itself as an aristocracy, as explicitly expressed for instance by the Belgian colonial social theorist van der Kerken.429 Into this picture of warlike "superimposition" fits the notion com- mon at the time, and developed in particular by de Calonne- Beaufaict, that the history of the region could be seen as a quick suc- cession of broad migration waves (Schweinfurth's and Emin's "Wogen und Wandern der Volkerstimme"!) over the past two or three centu- ries, each triggering the next in a kind of "chain reaction." In this model, the Avungara Azande, as the last of these "waves," had either conquered whole ethnic groups in accordance with the model of Eu- ropean nation states, or they had forced them to emigrate.430 We know today that this view of V6lkerwanderungen is purely a specula- tive stereotypical explanatory model reaching back to ancient histori- ography, and originating in tendencies toward abstract systematiza- tion.431 Although present-day research in archeology and historical 42"Evans-Pritchard, "Zande State," esp. 104-07; idem., Azande, esp. 33, 145, 165; and for the Abandia Dampierre, Ancien royaume, esp. 433-43. 429L'ethnie Mongo (2 vols.: Brussels, 1944), 2:506-08; cf. Bertrand in de Calonne- Beaufaict, Azande, xxix-xxx. The idea that the "first" Azande were primarily mo- bile, warlike hunters (Evans-Pritchard, "Zande State," 109-10) can be seen as a remnant of the theory. Schweinfurth's emphasis on the Azande as hunters pro- vided the basis for this interpretation. 430Although de Calonne-Beaufaict was the only writer to systematize the migra- tion movements into four "waves" (three "Sudanic" and one Bantu "invasion;" cf. especially Azande, 247-48), the reconstructions of authors such as Hutereau, Vanden Plas, or Czekanowski were also based on the migration postulate. In his study of the ethnic composition of Azande society, Evans-Pritchard also included the groups worked out by de Calonne-Beaufaict.. 43 Lszl6 Vajda,"Zur Frage von Volkerwanderungen," Paideuma 19/20(1973/74), 6-53.</page><page sequence="118">206 Paola Ivanov linguistics assumes that the periods of development were much longer, these speculative migrations are repeatedly found in the literature, since the historians of the early colonial period claimed that their the- ses were based on the oral traditions of the people concerned.432 However, in those cases where detailed information is available, it is clear that reports of compact migrations of a whole "tribe" under "pressure" from the Azande resulted from applying the traditions of individual groups of households to a whole ethnic or linguistic group, or that the politically or militarily motivated movements of small, sometimes linguistically and ethnically heterogeneous groups which formed the retinue of a leader were confused with "tribal migra- tions."433 The case of the Zande-speakers on the river Dungu (Bamboy) mentioned above is also instructive. Originally these were followers of Yakpati's first-born son Renzi, or of his sons, and au- tonomous groups were formed only in the course of the advance of the Khartoumers. As this dynastic branch had died out, the memory of its expansion was already lost among the Azande in the colonial period, and only the information of the travelers makes it possible to refute de Calonne-Beaufaict's theory, according to which the Bamboy had fled from conquest by the Avungara from the Mbomu valley as far as the Sue-Aka-Dungu area in a very short time as part of a larger "Sudanic wave."434 In the case of other groups, such as the Azande Adio of the Makaraka district, it can also be supposed that their spread is attributable to the swift advance of the Avungara, which led to the expansion of groups belonging to their following, who may even not have been Zande-speaking originally. Just as resistance or displacement only affected groups of house- holds, integration into the Avungara principalities also concerned small communities and was inspired by political interests; some groups also went through several changes of alliance.

Many of the "dynasties" of "chiefs" recognized by the colonial governments among the subject peoples can be followed back only to the time of the arrival of the Azande, and we can assume that they attained power only through their con- nection with the Avungara system of rule. Indeed, societies with little internal cohesion-groups speaking different languages living in scat- tered settlements or small village communities with no integrative in- stitutions such as elaborate initiation rituals or complex marriage alli- ances-seem to have populated the whole of the Avungara expansion area from the Mbomu to the Uele and the Sue.435 XX The ethnic classification and reorganization of the population of the region by the colonial administrations, especially in Belgian Congo and the Sudan, and the conceptualization of this classification in the works of the colonial period not only removed all traces of local po- litical traditions, but also of the change brought about through in- volvement in the commercial networks of the nineteenth century. Thus the ethnically heterogeneous groups that had arisen under the leadership of Arabized potentates were increasingly identified with "tribes" or subgroups of a "tribe," with all the implications of a "natural" entity associated with this term. As an example we might mention the group of the Islamized chief Bandas, which is still found today in the linguistic literature under the name of "Kresh-Naka."436 Not only the temporal, but also the spatial dimension, is lost in this kind of ethnographic approach. In the accounts of "Azande cul- ture and society" the possibility of regional differences was not con- sidered, particularly serious in the case of a group such as the Azande. It must be remembered not only that the Azande were an "amalgam" of various ethnic components, but also that the integrated groups 43Slbid., 410-520, 570-72, 586-89. 436Cf. the historical information given by Santandrea, Tribal History, 191-228, and the linguistic classification in Archibald N.

One of the most urgent tasks for research is to investigate the regional vari- ants in the culture of the Azande-or more correctly, of the popula- tion of the Avungara Azande principalities-since we are often faced with contradictory information. The fiction of uniform "tribal cultu- res" was consistently upheld in Czekanowski's ethnographic descrip- tions, for example, so that one gains the impression that we are deal- ing with a number of quite distinctive "tribes" which were also terri- torially separate from each other. It is only in the overviews of the routes followed by Czekanowski that we see clearly the marked eth- nic intermingling which was characteristic of the Dungu-Uele- Bomokandi area through which he traveled.437 The exclusion of chronological and regional factors in favor of the idea that each "tribe" had its own homogeneous culture distinguish- ing it from neighboring groups was associated with the old stereotype of the cultural superiority of the Mangbetu, and involved a number of problems, especially regarding study of the material culture. The "Spartan" Azande were still denied any artistic inclinations and skills; as Bertrand put it, material goods would only have hindered them in their migrations.438 This idea influenced in particular Czekanowski's descriptions of the material culture of the Uele peoples, for he as- sumed that in the Uele basin there was a dominating "Mangbetu cul- ture" of a high level which influenced the other peoples of the region, including the Azande, and had even been almost completely adopted by some groups (e.g., the Barambu, Amadi, and Bangba).439 Thus in his ethnographic-anthropological atlas he described clay pots which he collected in Surango, a government station in the Barambu terri- tory, as "characteristic forms of the show pots in the Mangbetu area of influence."440 The long, narrow "sabres" with broad, double- edged endpieces which were used by the Azande and some of their neighbors (including the Bantu-speaking Bua) were erroneously classi- fied among the Mangbetu weapons, although he admitted himself that such sabres were seen only in the southwest of the Mangbetu ter- 437Ethnographie, 23-26. 438Bertrand in de Calonne-Beaufaict, Azande, xxi. 439Cf. in particular "Arbeiten der Expedition," 605-06, and Ethnographie, 206, 220. By the term "Mangbetu" Czekanowski meant both the Mangbetu dynasty and the kingdoms or principalities founded by it, as well as the peoples of the Mangbetu group of languages, which involves additional difficulties. 440Czekanowski, Ethnographisch-anthropologischer Atlas, 57, plates 166 and 167.

It is only recently that Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim have questioned the artistic predominance of the Mangbetu in the region, and shown that even the anthropomorphic wood carvings and clay pots, which until then had been considered as the highest achievement of Mangbetu art, were not produced by Mangbetu art- ists alone.443 One of the firmest supporters of the superiority of the Mangbetu with regard to artistic and technical skills was Evans- Pritchard. In his study of Azande culture he emphasized that most of the more developed craft products among the Azande-whether in the field of carving or pottery, architecture or metalworking-are at- tributable to techniques and styles borrowed from Mangbetu culture. Among the borrowings, he included anthropomorphic wood sculp- ture, believing that the human heads carved on the neck end of Azande harps should also be attributed to the influence of Mangbetu carving, even though the harp itself was the most characteristic musi- cal instrument of the Avungara and their earliest Azande followers (called "Ambomu" in Evans-Pritchard's research area).444 Schildkrout's and Keim's exemplary historical study demonstrates that at least the sculpted heads on the harps, as many early specimens prove, first appeared among the Azande, while anthropomorphic carvings spread among the Mangbetu only in the early colonial pe- riod, partly as a reaction to the preferences of European administra- tors, travelers, and collectors, for whom such craft objects were often produced. Above all it becomes clear that ethnic categories are unsuit- able for the classification of material culture and art styles, especially 441The name "sabre" has become accepted for this weapon, although the cutting edge is on the inside of the curve, and not on the outside as with normal sabres. 442Czekanowski, Ethnographie, 143-44 and figure 32; idem., Ethnographisch- anthropologischer Atlas, 23, plate 57.

He wrote: The Azande have today something of a reputation as wood-carvers, but they are ready to admit that they learnt their more elaborate modes of carving from peoples beyond the Uele, and more particularly from the Mangbetu, who, as is well known, are skilled carvers...446 With respect to Mangbetu carving, Emin had written in one of his letters: "Of course, the real artists in wood carvings, i.e. heads, fig- ures, etc., are found more among the A-Sandeh."447 Evans-Pritchard, however, rejected this statement: Emin's knowledge of the Azande was slight-he was only acquainted, and rather superficially, with the Zandeized Adio to the east, and his knowledge of the Mangbetu was also very limited; so I have no hesi- tation in contradicting him in this matter..., and in doing so agree- ing with what is implied, with regard to wood-carving, in a remark by Casati, who, though he may not have been so industrious a recorder as Emin, knew very much more about both peoples than he did: 'The Sandeh are greatly admired for their ironwork; the Mambettu are re- markable for the perfection of their wood-carving...'448 Evans-Pritchard wrote further that, according to his informants, carv- ing in the "Mangbetu style" was only introduced into the principality of Gbudwe at the end of the nineteenth century from the south, and he believed that any anthropomorphic objects collected among the Azande before this time could have been imported directly from the Mangbetu region.449 But closer scrutiny shows that Evans-Pritchard was too hasty in in- terpreting the reports by Emin and Casati. If we consult Emin's jour- nals, the context of his remark concerning figurative carving becomes clear.

He used this opportunity to make a large ethnographic collection.4s5 At the end of his stay, he wrote: "So this time I am re- turning home loaded with treasures; wonderful wood carvings by the Sand~h, Abusanga [Mabisanga] and Abarambo; beautiful pottery by the Mangbettu and Sandeh.",451 The remark about figurative carving noted above, which Emin wrote after completing his Monbuttu trip, most probably referred to this collection which was lost to the Mahdiyya, and is thus an indica- tion that anthropomorphic objects occurred at the beginning of the 1880s, not in the northern Mangbetu territories Emin visited, but among the Azande living south of the Uele and ruled by the descen- dants of Kipa (Ndeni's line). Like the Mangbetu themselves, these people were almost unknown to Evans-Pritchard. As far as Casati's information regarding Mangbetu carving is concerned, in the words quoted by Evans-Pritchard Casati was not speaking of anthropomor- phic sculptures but seems rather, as elsewhere in his discussions on the material culture of the region, to be repeating Schweinfurth's views on the advanced nature of Mangbetu art. In two places in his book, on the other hand, Casati explicitly mentioned the carving of human fig- ures as a craft common among the Barambu, who were at that time living partly independently, and partly under Avungara or Mangbetu rule.452 There are further indications that in the region south of the Uele the carving of anthropomorphic figures was at first restricted mainly to the Barambu and Azande, and spread to the Mangbetu core area only later.453 Evans-Pritchard's arguments reveal serious weaknesses in his critical use of sources, whether written evidence by Europeans or oral information from local informants, and these weaknesses are magnified by the fact that his field research was restricted to a rela- tively small area, and that he adopted the premise that every "tribe" had a uniform "traditional" culture. The reference to information re- ceived "from the Azande" was sufficient for Evans-Pritchard to reject Emin's statements; he did not consider the possibility that these state- 4S0Emin, Tagebiicher, 2:464-73. In addition Casati had also supplied Emin with objects from the principalities of Kipa's sons, Kana and Bakangai: ibid., 2:463. 4S'Ibid., 2:476. 4S2Casati, Dieci anni, 1:116, 172. 453Schildkrout/Keim, African Reflections, 237-43.</page><page sequence="124">212 Paola lvanov ments could be true of Azande groups unknown to him and/or of precolonial times. The claims of early European observers were not examined within their context, but were used without any satisfactory explanation only as far as they fit into the prearranged reconstruction (such as Schweinfurth's and Casati's general belief in the artistic supe- riority of the Mangbetu), while the statement by Emin that relates ex- pressly to figurative carving was rashly rejected. The qualities of Evans-Pritchard's style which, as Clifford Geertz shows, make his anthropological writings so convincing-his out- standing talent for "visual" representation, his ability to render com- plex facts understandable through simple, clear judgments, but above all his confident manner of speaking, with all the authority of the fieldworker, in a series of clear and unrestricted statements-are in fact misleading. In the extremely difficult task of investigating the his- tory of an African people for which very little information is avail- able, the facts are not nearly as "clear" as Evans-Pritchard's "easy cer- titude of perception," achieved through rhetorical means, might sug- gest.454 In many cases Evans-Pritchard's arguments, however brilliant, have a rather apodictic character and lack analysis in depth. Evans- Pritchard gives fascinating "transparencies" of precolonial society that contain many important insights, but inaccuracies and small careless errors-sometimes even serious ones-repeatedly crept into his historical reconstructions.4ss As a further example, remember his claim that Piaggia's information showed that the Khartoum traders had not yet entered the principality of Bazingbi, ignoring Piaggia's statements to the contrary for no plausible reason. And he was "somewhat sceptical" of Casati's mention of a pronounced cult sur- rounding the deceased Prince Kipa, because of other errors in the work of this author,4s6 even though countless other sources confirm the importance of the cults venerating dead Avungara rulers.457 Thus the only sacred element in the legitimation of the Avungara was left out of his analysis, an element which reflects the importance within the political system of hierarchical lineage principles, besides the de- velopment of personal power. Following these principles, subordinate 454Geertz, Works and Lives, 57-58. 4SSFor "transparencies" see ibid., 64-69. 4s6"Sources," 143; Casati, Dieci anni, 1:186-93. 4s7 Cf. among the sources known to Evans-Pritchard: Junker, Reisen, 3:23-26; Hutereau, Histoire des peuplades, 231-32, 239n1, 245; Czekanowski, Ethno- graphie, 16, 25, 65-66; Lagae, Azande, 62-63, Lotar, Grande chronique de I'Uele, 191, 195.

Viewed from the present, it is rather Evans-Pritchard's reconstruc- tions which should be regarded sceptically.458 His somewhat cavalier attitude to oral and written sources, especially travelers' accounts, can be explained by his understanding of (social) anthropology, according to which reliable information can be obtained only through field- work. For him, therefore, any indication of a lack of experience in the field was enough to invalidate the accounts of travelers and other "unprofessional" observers who had no knowledge of the local lan- guages. But he overrated the value of field research: in his argumenta- tion it appears as if fieldwork per se guarantees the validity of the data collected and of the judgments they engender, thus rendering largely superfluous the need to subject field observations and state- ments made by informants to a critical examination. XXII To make this last point quite clear, I would like to conclude by return- ing to the question of the supposed cannibalism of the Azande in the light of Evans-Pritchard's critical study of the sources. No source from the early colonial period failed to include the long established topos of cannibalism. As Evans-Pritchard emphasized, the "proofs" from this period, like the earlier ones, are only unfounded claims based on hearsay. Moreover, cannibalism was usually described as belonging to the past, so that no one can be expected to produce evidence of it.459 We could conclude by joining him in saying: "Now, I think that no one will deny that the evidence of the travellers, each considered inde- pendently, ranges from the dubious to the worthless."460 We could that, is, if he did not add: "but there is no smoke without fire, and taking all the evidence together we may conclude that there is a strong probability that cannibalism was practised by at any rate some Azande."461 4SsAII the more so since he failed to mention that in his fieldwork area access to Gbudwe's grave had been prohibited by the Anglo-Egyptian government: Giorgetti, Cannibalism in Zandeland, 199-200. 459"Zande Cannibalism," 144-50. A significant exception is the work of de Calonne-Beaufaict, whose freedom from prejudice has already been pointed out. 460Here he also included early colonial officers. 461"Zande Cannibalism," 153.</page><page sequence="126">214 Paola Ivanov This statement, which strikes us as a logical short circuit and has been the occasion of sharp criticism, can be attributed to Evans- Pritchard's unshakable belief in field research.462 He applied the term "fairly conclusive," not to the statements of the travelers and early colonial officers, which he himself had invalidated, but to the infor- mation on cannibalism gathered by Larken, Lagae, and himself-in other words, by observers who had spent a long time among the Azande and spoke their language. Evans-Pritchard considered infor- mation gathered on this basis to be trustworthy, despite the fact that the evidence "was not based on anything seen, only on things heard."463 Evans-Pritchard's informants-just like those of Larken and Lagae-did not deny that cannibalism had existed "in former times."464 But they did insist that the Avungara and their "genuine" Azande subjects had always abhorred the eating of human flesh, and that it was only the foreign conquered peoples who had been canni- bals. By comparing his own data with the earlier reports, Evans- Pritchard came to the conclusion that in the past there must have been occasional cases of anthropophagy, but that these cannibalistic prac- tices were mainly prevalent among the assimilated foreign groups, while the Avungara and the majority of their original Azande subjects ("Ambomu")-with the exception of single individuals who had adopted the foreign custom-must be considered innocent of the charge of man-eating. According to him this would also explain the "evidence" of cannibalism offered by Piaggia and Schweinfurth, since the areas visited by both travelers were mainly inhabited by barely ac- culturated foreign groups.465 So, although he himself had invalidated the evidence of cannibal- ism from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Evans- Pritchard was prepared to accept "proofs" from a period in which cannibalism was in any case supposed to no longer exist, because they 462Erwin Frank, "'Sie fressen Menschen'," 221, described this argument as one "which translated into mathematical terms says that three times nothing must be more than nothing." 463"Zande Cannibalism," 153. Note the way Evans-Pritchard introduced the statements by Lagae and Larken: on Lagae he wrote (ibid., 150): "One of the most authoritative descriptions of the Azande is undoubtedly that by my friend Mgr Lagae, a Dominican Father who spent many years among the Azande and is the first of our witnesses who was able to converse easily with that people." On Larken (ibid., 151): "My old and much esteemed friend Major P. M. Larken, who has also resided among the Azande for many years and who speaks their tongue fluently, says ... much the same as the Monsignor." 464Lagae, Azande, 49-50; Larken, "Impressions," 115. 46s"Zande Cannibalism," 150-61.</page><page sequence="127">Western Perceptions and Azande Historiography 215 came from the Azande themselves and from "qualified" scholars. De facto Evans-Pritchard takes the view that knowledge of the language and field experience were sufficent for the gathering of reliable data about the past, and on this basis he confirmed retrospectively the con- clusions of earlier observers which he had previously declared to be of no value. His historical reconstructions no longer meet the standards of present-day research into African history, which requires critical handling of the written and oral sources. When evaluating the information obtained by Lagae, Larken, and Evans-Pritchard from "the Azande," we should bear several points in mind. In the colonial period cannibalism was always related to the "old days." Thus the possibility cannot be excluded that the Azande informants wanted to satisfy the expectations of the colonial officer Larken and the missionary Lagae by confirming that the abominable customs of the past had been stamped out through colonization and missionizing efforts. In a statement that Evans-Pritchard treated as particularly significant on the earlier existence of cannibalistic prac- tices among the Azande, his informant even spoke expressly of an unidentified past in which the Azande were "just like animals in the bush."466 Arens is quite justified in emphasizing that this statement cannot be considered as an eyewitness report, but as a reference to some "pre-cultural" state of the Azande, not fixed in time, and that it is above all an expression of disapproval of former "savage" cus- toms.467 And since it was usually the conquered foreigners who were accused-by the Avungara or the "genuine Azande"-of cannibalism, we are dealing here with the well-known phenomenon that Arens de- scribes as "the syndrome of 'others but not us'."468 In his book on witchcraft Evans-Pritchard wrote that his infor- mants-mainly "genuine" Azande ("Ambomu") who were familiar with life at court-despised the "foreign" clans, who had no connec- tion with the top level of the Avungara power structure, and attrib- uted further practices to them which they considered as inferior and unpresentable at court, such as magic.469 But according to Evans- Pritchard, his informants also told of concrete cases of cannibalism which they had witnessed themselves. For he always demanded scien- tific "proofs" if in the course of an interview someone mentioned that cannibalistic practices used to be common: "So when I was told that 4"6Evans-Pritchard, "Cannibalism: a Zande Text," Africa 26(1956), 73-74. 4"7The Man-Eating Myth (Oxford, 1979), 150. 46"8bid., 84, 139-45; Frank, "'Sie fressen Menschen'," 200-05. 469Witchcraft, 352-53, 425-26, 445-46, 470.</page><page sequence="128">216 Paola Ivanov people used to eat human flesh I sought to discover who had in fact done so in the personal experience of my informants."470 In this way he collected about fifteen 'eyewitness' reports, without taking into ac- count that they were probably influenced by his own methods of in- quiry. Finally, it must not be forgotten that the Azande were familiar with the "Niam-Niam" stereotype. It is reported that Azande individuals hotly refused to be called "Niam-Niam," which for them was synony- mous with auro, (despised) 'foreigners,' and that if they were called auro they retorted, "m'as-tu vu manger de la chair humaine?"471 This brings us to two points that still need clearing up in the whole discus- sion on cannibalism, namely, the interrelated questions of what sig- nificance concepts and accusations of cannibalism had within the Azande culture itself, and to what extent Arab and European stereo- types of cannibalism influenced the Azande, who, after all, were con- fronted for decades with the name "Niam-Niam" and their own al- leged anthropophagy. From his recent field experience, Keim reports of the Mangbetu, who were also described as man-eaters by the early travelers, that they still tell tales of their former cannibalism with great amusement. They point to the Eucharist as evidence that Europeans indulge can- nibalistic inclinations, and maintain that cans of corned beef are filled with human flesh.472 In Evans-Pritchard's time the Azande too were convinced that the British doctors were cannibals and only performed operations in order to obtain human flesh. In the 1940s local staff members of an agricultural research project in Sudanese Azandeland were suspected of preparing to kidnap children on behalf of European man-eaters.473 At the end of his article, Evans-Pritchard said: "Both Europeans and Arabs seem to have a morbid interest in cannibalism and tend to accept almost any tale told them about it."474 The same is true of the Azande and their neighbors. Rumors of an- thropophagy, which probably were already part of local narrative topoi, seem to have spread at lightning speed in central Africa follow- ing the first contacts with northern Sudanese traders, who dearly loved tales of cannibalism. The existence of concepts of cannibalism among the Azande, however, cannot hide the fact that there are no proofs at all of cannibalism actually being practiced.

However, this argument also shows the deep ties, despite its revolu- tionary claims, between social anthropology and the conceptions of African societies, developed in the nineteenth century and put into ad- ministrative practice during the colonial period, and thus indicates the need to include a critical appraisal of the scholarly and epistemologi- cal tradition in African historiography. Since Evans-Pritchard's stud- ies, there has been hardly any substantial contribution to research on the precolonial organization of the Avungara Azande.47s But from the point of view of historiography, there can be no definitive knowledge of a particular topic or a particular group, which is what anthropolo- gists for a long time took Evans-Pritchard's work on the Azande to be. 47l1n Zande Scheme, Reining mainly discussed the transformation of Azande soci- ety in the later colonial period, although he did give some valuable information on the precolonial and early colonial situation. eric de Dampierre's comprehensive study of the Abandia Nzakara kingdom, Un ancien royaumne Bandia du Haut- Oubangui, which was little known until then, included the Abandia Azande only briefly, and relied on the reconstructions by Evans-Pritchard and former scholars for comparisons with the Avungara political system.</page></plain_text>
