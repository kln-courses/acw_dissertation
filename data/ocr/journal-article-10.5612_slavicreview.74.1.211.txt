<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Book Reviews 211 Moving on to Chagall’s fi gurative anthropomorphic representations of real- ity, Koller investigates his color-based “rhetoric of painting,” which is rooted in the  subjectivity of his “enacted self” (59). An emphasis on subjectivity, which marks  Chagall’s early period, was also a defi ning feature of the new generation of Yiddish  modernist and avant-garde poets who entered the literary stage in the wake of WWI.  By exploring the Yiddish cultural context, Koller examines the literary and linguistic  foundations of Chagall’s visual language. The close links between Jewish folklore  and Chagall’s imagery have, of course, been studied by a number of critics and schol- ars, most recently by Benjamin Harshav, but Koller takes this approach a step further  by conceptualizing the relationship as a way of “transforming Yiddish semantics into  aesthetics” (96), which was part of Chagall’s “double coup” in international avant- garde and national Jewish art. The central part of the book deals with textual and visual representations of  violence and death in Jewish literature and visual arts in the wake of WWI and the  Russian revolution and civil war. This moment marks Chagall’s radical break with  the fi gurative mode that had been prevalent in prewar Jewish art. He developed a  strikingly new metaphorical language in close interaction with contemporary Yid- dish and Hebrew poets, particularly the Kiev group of Yiddish poets (Perets Markish,  Dovid Hofshtein, Leib Kvitko). In the same way, as Koller demonstrates by analyzing  Kvitko’s collection of pogrom poetry, 1919 (1923), the young Yiddish poetry acquired  a new “originality and power of linguistic imagery” (119) by adopting a new poetics  of visuality. The third part of the book explores the aft erlife of intermediality and  intertextuality in Chagall’s works of the later period, when the immediate shock of  violence gave way to its memorialization. Koller makes a forceful argument for a radical revision of the conventional un- derstanding of both the east European avant-garde in general and the Jewish cultural  renaissance in particular. An English translation of her book would be an invaluable  contribution to the ongoing conversation around these issues. Mikhail Krutikov University of Michigan Fairy Tales and True Stories: The History of Russian Literature for Children  and Young People (1574–2010). By Ben Hellman. Russian History and Culture,  vol. 13. Leiden: Brill, 2013. xi, 588 pp. Bibliography. Index. Illustrations. $199.00,  hard bound. This study is an encyclopedic, historically minded overview of Russian, Soviet, and  post-Soviet children’s literature during the course of over fi ve centuries. While the  analysis and descriptions strengthen and deepen as the modern era approaches and  slow down as the Soviet Union collapses, the volume manages to provide its read- ers with a substantive sense of the transformation of children’s literature from the   seventeenth century to the start of the twenty-fi rst. Fairy Tales and True Stories in- cludes descriptions of stories, novellas, poems, translations, humor writing, lulla- bies, plays, and more. Ben Hellman casts his net very widely, if not always especially  deeply. Organized strictly chronologically, the fi rst third of the book introduces the  reader to the history of young people’s reading up until the end of the nineteenth  century (chapters 1–4), getting more detailed with each subsequent era. These early  chapters read like a comprehensive listing of children’s literature publications rather  than a sustained analysis of content and its relationship to political ideologies, social  </page> <page sequence="2"> 212 Slavic Review change, or cultural trends. The context within which these works of literature for  young people were produced appears primarily in the background and as a way to or- ganize information along a straight path. When Hellman allows himself to pause on  the broader trends, the analysis becomes more interesting. The author’s discussion  of Enlightenment ideas and their impact on the subject matter of children’s books  is a highlight in these early pages. However, there are also missed opportunities.  One wonders if the early nineteenth-century “stagnation” (15) in the production of  children’s literature relates to politics, changing social conditions, or something else  entirely. Hellman does not say. In a sense, the book is written for those who already  have a solid background in Russian history when they open its fi rst pages. As one  small example, when Hellman discusses Vissarion Belinskii and his romanticism, he  alludes to Belinskii’s faith in narodnost ́ without providing the context from which  that concept arose, leaving those readers without a grounding in the subject a bit at  a loss. The second third of the book moves from the fi n de siècle through the postwar  era (chapters 5–8). One of the richest sections of these chapters, and, indeed, of the  book as a whole, is the discussion of Lidiia Charskaia. Hellman provides an in-depth  discussion of her works, her readership, her popularity, and her infl uence. Even here,  though, Hellman does not allow for a substantial elaboration of context. It would have  been useful, for instance, to have a more textured understanding of why “women  writers were oft en more apt than their male colleagues to take into consideration the  expectations of their readers” (178). The need for more background and conceptual  understanding aside, the analysis that Hellman does provide in this section is in- sightful, and it is one of the few places where he refers to existing scholarship. Once  Hellman reaches a discussion of the Soviet era, he shift s his emphasis, necessarily, to  the institutions and politics behind the publishing of children’s works, thus adding  an additional layer to the story. The reader learns about the political undertones and  overtones, oft en ideologically motivated, of the material available for children’s con- sumption. This is well-known terrain but deserves space in such a sweeping study.  Moreover, Hellman provides some of his most skilled analysis in the depictions of  early Soviet writing, from his discussions of nature writing to fantasy. The last third of the book, which brings us up to 2010 (chapters 9–12), opens  with a discussion of Khrushchev’s thaw and its impact on children’s literature. Here  the discussions of poetry and writing provide the reader with a sense of the multi- tude of genres and approaches authors took in these decades, up until the Gorbachev  era, when literature oriented toward young people ceased to be important. The fi nal  two chapters—one on glasnost and the other on the post-Soviet years—are very short  summaries of two non-active eras. The reason for this, Hellman explains, is that chil- dren’s and youth literature was simply not being written at this time, and when it was,  it could not compare to the quality or importance of adult literature. Although not especially analytical in its presentation, this volume will be of  great use to anyone with a marginal interest in Russian literature for children and  young adults. No doubt it will serve as an essential tool for graduate students, faculty  members, and researchers and inspire further studies of individual works, authors,  and eras. Even though depth is too oft en sacrifi ced for breadth, this choice will allow  many to use it as a touchstone and reference book in years to come.
