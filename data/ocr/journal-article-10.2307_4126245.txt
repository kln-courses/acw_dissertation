He epitomizes the pioneering interdisciplinary researcher, who in this case was able to take his plethora of chemical and statis- tical skills, combine them with an excellent understanding of archaeological data gained by close collabora- tion with archaeologists, and bridge the gulf in solving important archaeological problems, especially of the provenience or source of many materials. In 1960 he proposed that INAA (instrumental neutron activation analysis) could be used to source Mesoamerican ceramics. At a time when computer database and statistical methods were in their infancy for scientific and scholarly research generally, he proposed building INAA databases that would serve to charac- terize ceramic production at specific sites and enable socioeconomic systems to be reconstructed. After a two-year assignment as head of the Division of Research and Laboratories at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Gar's proposal began to be realized in 1968 when he joined Dr. Edward V. Sayre in the Chemistry Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Archaeology, and later art history, provided an ideal avenue for demonstrating the usefulness of the peaceful employment of nuclear energy. For the next 18 years, the Brookhaven group experimented with and carried out archaeometric provenience investigations with archaeological collaborators from around the world, trained many archaeologists and their graduate students, and pioneered innovative approaches to strengthening the link between archaeol- ogy and the physical sciences. Gar's role during the 1970s in developing sophisticated statistical techniques for handling the enor- mous amount of chemical data produced by INAA should be stressed. In collaboration with Brookhaven Lab programmers, he wrote a search program that would scan the databases for samples that were chemi- cally similar to a given specimen. The probabilistic "Mahalanobis Distance" search engines, a novel devel- opment, soon followed. Other innovations at Brookhaven that Gar achieved include computer-controlled sample changers and magnetic tape readouts that permitted the analysis of large numbers of archaeologi- cal specimens. With Dr. Phillip Weigand of SUNY Stony Brook and others, he carried out a full-scale investigation of New World turquoise procurement and trade. The demonstration that trade in turquoise took place be- tween centers in New Mexico, such as Chaco Canyon, and pre-Columbian Mexico has led to a reevaluation of the cultural interactions between these two areas. Gar has made similar contributions to the proveniencing of obsidian and limestone. The Brookhaven Limestone Database Project has been able to trace the stones used in building some of the major cathedrals, ruined abbeys, and cloisters of Europe back to their quar- ries. The original edifices from which Medieval sculptures were taken has also been determined. This ongoing project is now affiliated with more than 33 museums in the United States, France, and Great Britain. Prior to the development of AMS '4C dating, Gar developed a miniature 14C counter at Brookhaven that would date small samples of 10 mg. The technique was used to date a sample from an instance of iron smelting thought to have been carried by the Frobhisher expedition to the Arctic in A.D. 1576. The date for the ingot, however, was found to be of earlier Norse or Viking date. One of the themes of Gar's research has been that each new advance in science is potentially of value to the archaeologist or art historian. For instance, he suggested to Dr. Peter Gaspar of Washington University that the gold content of ancient coins could be uniquely determined, nondestructively, by gold K-edge absorp- tion using gamma radiation from '33BA as a probe. Gaspar then tested and published this innovative method. In summary, Garman Harbottle has been a pioneer in the development of the archaeological sciences. He fits well the ideal of a multifaceted scientist who has had the opportunity to see how the hard sciences can be made to serve the needs, and extend the horizons, of archaeological research.</page><page sequence="3">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 233 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA GOLD MEDAL AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT ROBERT MCCORMICK ADAMS Robert McCormick Adams is one of America's foremost archaeologists. In the course of a highly distin- guished career Professor Adams has worked in both the Near East and Mesoamerica. Above all, however, it is his pioneer research in Iraq, with its broad cross-cultural implications, which has been most richly acclaimed in scholarly circles throughout the world. Over the course of his career Adams has emphasized the importance of social interaction and cultural ecology in the evolution of civilizations. In particular, his research has explored the relevance of cultural ecology as an explanation for the rise of civilizations as a cross-cultural phenomenon. Representative of this facet of Adams's work are the Henry Lewis Morgan Lectures, which he delivered at the University of Rochester in 1965 and which were published in book form as The Evolution of Urban Society in the following year. In this influential study Adams compared in detail the development of early pristine civilizations in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. He showed how, despite differences in detail, processual similarities led to remarkable parallels in the way that these unrelated civilizations evolved. From the outset Adams's theoretical contributions were closely supported by his innovative and timely field surveys in Iraq, which saved a vast store of otherwise unexamined data from irretrievable loss. This work was concentrated in the broad alluvial plain of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers where early Uruk, Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian civilizations each emerged in turn. Such fieldwork in Mesopotamia remained one of his more significant, consuming concerns well into the 1970s, and fresh surveys probably would have been initiated in the 1980s but for the constraints of the Iran-Iraq War. Adams's survey data embraced all available material from the Neolithic period well into Islamic times. It provided an unparalleled data set for examining how the natural environment had affected local subsistence strategies and Mesopotamian cultural evolution as a whole. The results of this exhaustive examination of the available archaeological evidence culminated in the publication of a remarkable series of monographs in- cluding Land Behind Baghdad (1965), The Uruk Countryside (1972, with Hans Nissen), and the magisterial study, Heartland of Cities (1981). With the aim of continuing to flesh out his ideas on the importance of social interactions, both within and between given societies, he published a number of landmark articles including "Ideologies: Unity and Diversity" (1992) and "Anthropological Perspectives on Ancient Trade" (1974). More recently he has published Paths of Fire-An Anthropologist's Inquiry into Western Technology (1996). This insightful volume explores the interaction between the forces of social and technological change and the implications of this interaction for the modern world. As far as Robert Adams's distinguished contributions as a teacher are concerned, many of his students now hold academic positions of distinction, through which they are transmitting his innovative lines of thinking to new generations of students. While service to the discipline at large is not a formal criterion for the present award, it cannot pass without notice that Professor Adams has always maintained an interest in policies which promote research and that he has occupied a particularly notable succession of significant academic positions. Thus, apart from two terms as the Director of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, he has served as Dean and Provost of the University of Chicago, as a Councilor of the National Academy of Sciences and as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute from 1984 to 1994. From this last date, moreover, he has continued to teach and advise a new generation of students as an adjunct professor in the Department of Anthropology of the University of California at San Diego. In conclusion, this is an overall record of distinguished archaeological achievement that few can be said to match. And, on behalf of the Archaeological Institute of America, I believe the award of the Gold Medal constitutes an entirely fitting degree of recognition for an individual who happily remains "in harness" more than 45 years since the time of his first faculty appointment-and who unquestionably remains at the cutting edge of our common subject.</page><page sequence="4">234 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD NANCY BOOKIDIS AND CHARLES K. WILLIAMS, II The Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to recognize Nancy Bookidis and Charles K. Williams, II, with the Award for Outstanding Public Service for their important roles in the successful recovery and repatriation of archaeological material stolen from Greece. On 12 April 1990, thieves broke into the archaeological museum of ancient Corinth and made off with nearly 300 objects, assaulting the night guard and stealing the museum's payroll. The theft, the largest ever from a Greek museum, was widely publicized in the press and in a special 1990 issue of IFAReports (11:6). Although several of the objects were recovered from a New York antiquities gallery in 1998, it was not until the fall of 1999 that Greek and American authorities were able to make a major breakthrough in the case. On 7 September 1999, FBI agents working in collaboration with Greek police officials recovered the majority of the Corinth antiquities in a Miami storage facility. Three Roman portrait heads were later found in a New York auction house. In January of 2001, 274 of the artifacts were repatriated to Greece from the United States. The successful recovery of the stolen Corinthian artifacts was clearly a model of international cooperation between Greek and American law enforcement agencies and archaeological authorities. Many individual archaeologists also played an important role in this effort, including those who worked anonymously for many years to keep the memory of the theft alive in the public consciousness. In particular, Nancy Bookidis and Charles K. Williams, II, longtime assistant director and director of the Corinth excavations of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, took immediate steps in 1990 to provide the Greek Ministry of Culture and Interpol with complete descriptions and photographs of the stolen objects for distribution to law en- forcement agencies, museums, galleries, and private collectors. For nearly a decade after the theft, Bookidis and Williams diligently continued to write articles for popular journals about the stolen artifacts, and to keep a sharp watch for any Corinthian material appearing on the art market. After the majority of the stolen material had been recovered in the Miami warehouse, Williams recognized one of the still missing artifacts, a marble head of the god Serapis, in an auction catalogue in New York. As a result of this information, the last three portrait heads were eventually recovered. The prompt and diligent actions of Bookidis and Williams embody the very spirit of the AIA Code of Professional Responsibilities. Among the special responsibilities of archaeologists, the Code states that they "should anticipate and provide for adequate and accessible long-term storage and curatorial facilities for all archaeological materials, records, and archives" and that they "should treat others at home and in the field with respect and sensitivity. As primary stewards of the archaeological record, they should work actively to preserve that record in all its dimensions and for the long term; and they should give due consideration to the interests of others, both colleagues and the lay public, who are affected by the research." By demonstrat- ing the importance of detailed and accessible archives, by actively striving to meet the legal criterion of due diligence in the recovery of stolen artifacts, and by educating the public about the illicit trade in antiquities, Bookidis and Williams have truly set new standards for future generations of archaeologists. For their extraordinary efforts to conserve, preserve, and protect the cultural heritage of the country in which they work, their selfless cooperation with Greek law enforcement authorities and archaeological col- leagues, and their efforts to inform the public of the importance of context in archaeological research, the Archaeological Institute of America is proud to honor Nancy Bookidis and Charles K. Williams, II, with this Outstanding Public Service Award.</page><page sequence="5">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 235 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA MARTHA AND ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD FRANK J. WEZNIAK Frank Wezniak guided the finances of the Institute for nearly 16 years, during times of great fiscal chal- lenges as well as through times of gratifying growth. The Institute is delighted today to acknowledge that it has greatly benefited from his wise and innovative stewardship, and to recognize with this award his extraor- dinary accomplishments. Frank's association with the Institute began on a rainy October day in 1985 when Artemis Joukowsky and then-President James Wiseman called on Frank at his home in Weston, Massachusetts. The visitors were hopeful that they would be able to persuade him to apply his famed financial acumen to helping the Institute rise from a financial situation so serious that its future existence was in jeopardy. Frank was impressed with the mission and prestige of the Institute, and, after looking closely at the operations and finances of the Institute over a period of several weeks, decided that he might indeed be helpful. He was elected to his first term as Treasurer that December, and immediately set out to build on wise changes in fiscal policy already set in motion by his predecessor as Treasurer, James H. Ottaway, Jr., and by Trustee Malcolm Wiener. Budgeting and accounting procedures were altered to ensure that expenditures reflected the specific goals of the opera- tional units (publications, lectures, headquarters, and other programs) of the Institute, as determined by the officers. In those difficult times, a number of temporary steps were taken by the President and the Board, acting with Frank Wezniak's guidance, to cut expenditures and to stop the eroding of the endowment. Even within the same fiscal year (1986), the deficit was reduced to a fraction of what had been anticipated, and the endowment actually increased in value. In the next fiscal year, after eight years of deficits that totaled a million dollars, there was actually a surplus, which marked the beginning of a remarkable string, rarely interrupted, of balanced budgets, year-end surpluses, and a growing endowment. Frank Wezniak understood that sound financial management required clear goals for the different operat- ing units of the Institute, and equally clear methods and schedules for achieving those goals, whether finan- cial or institutional. This was a central facet of his financial management during his extraordinary tenure as Treasurer, during which he worked with four successive presidents. He also served on special task forces and planning committees, whose deliberations shaped and clarified the immediate and longer-term aims of their successive deliberations. During the Institute's most recent financial challenges, in the course of worldwide economic downturn, Frank performed heroically, abandoning some earlier cherished goals in recognition of fiscal reality, and negotiating highly favorable terms for the Institute as it withdrew from direct responsibility for a publication it could no longer afford. The Martha and Artemis Joukowsky Distinguished Service Award of the Archaeological Institute of America recognizes volunteers who have furthered the work of the Institute and have improved its effectiveness through their sustained exceptional service. The Institute is pleased to present this year's award to Frank Wezniak, in recognition of his many years of service as the innovative, wise, and dedicated Treasurer of the Institute.</page><page sequence="6">236 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA EXCELLENCE IN UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING AWARD P. NICK KARDULIAS It is with great pleasure that the Archaeological Institute of America presents the Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching to Professor P. Nick Kardulias. Professor Kardulias has taught archaeology and anthropology at Youngstown State University, Kenyon College, and, since 1993, at the College of Wooster, where he is an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and the program in Archaeology. Professor Kardulias is a specialist in Aegean prehistory and has also taught courses in lithics, ethnoarchaeology, North American archaeology, cultural resource management, political anthropology, the history of classical antiquity, and a wide range of other topics. His excellence in undergraduate teach- ing is demonstrated, however, not in the broad range of his research and teaching subjects alone, but in the results. The letters written in support of his nomination by present and former students and colleagues provide ample evidence of his commitment and successes as a teacher of archaeology. If we can sum up his achievement in the words of one of his colleagues, "[Nick] is a master of the leading question, forcing students to reach beyond simple recitations of facts to the implications of those data for understanding human history and behavior. He encourages his students to think with, and not just about, archaeological materials." All those in the profession of teaching know how significant an achievement this is. The letters in support of his nomination describe his teaching methods as innovative and effective, combining many different modes of learning. These same letters outline Professor Kardulias's outstand- ing commitment to learning outside the classroom in the form of fieldtrips, hands-on experience, even sporting activities, and the occasional dinner at home with his mother. They also tell of an extraordinary degree of personal attention to students. He organizes student groups, arranges extracurricular events that involve hundreds of students in everything from atlatl throwing and flintknapping to simulated digs and the mounting of exhibits of artifacts. He has encouraged students to do fieldwork and worked tire- lessly to help them find transportation to field locations in Ohio, Cyprus, and Greece. He helped students to find funding for these activities, and in the field gave unstintingly of his time, his experience, and his knowledge. One writer says, "Nick's humor, intelligence, and almost encyclopedic knowledge [are] a journey in archaeological history in general and his ability to reach out and connect with students [is] amazing. He seems to understand people's questions before they even ask them, and his ability to explain concepts in a very clear and concise way is something I still envy when I myself am in front of a classroom." As part of his commitment to students, Professor Kardulias has worked with students to co-author pub- lished articles, and he has supervised many undergraduate honors theses. To do this he took on extra advising loads, and in the words of one writer, "[w]hile most professors work with between five and ten students as the most [on honors theses], Nick has regularly advised ... fifteen students a semester... while teaching a full course load and serving on multiple committees." Several students state that their continu- ing interests in archaeology stem from their contact with Professor Kardulias, and the number of his students who have gone on to graduate school and academic careers is indeed a remarkable testimony to his effectiveness as a teacher. As one of them says, "If not for him I can very truthfully say that I would not be where I am today." Professor Kardulias is praised not only for his global approach to teaching and his excellence and conviction but also as "unabashedly honest, dedicated, sincere, concerned, and kind." One writer says, "It is for his demeanor and vision that I value Professor Kardulias as my purest role model." This same infor- mant goes on to say, "[by] personal example he imparts that same precious lesson to those who continue their higher education in archaeology and to those who choose other professions." Yet another student says, "I regard him as a great mentor and friend," while another writes, "his vibrant humor, love for the discipline, and obvious joy in teaching were and still are an inspiration." The testimony from students provides ample evidence that Professor Kardulias has had a major effect on his students. One writes, "I will never forget the time that Nick enlisted me . . . to participate in a lithic microwear study... [w]hen the time came to undertake the experiment we found ourselves in the base- ment of... a 19th century farmhouse..,. cleaning a none-too-fresh deer carcass with razor-sharp, inch-sized pieces of chert! The fact that the basement had a dirt floor and a single naked lightbulb hanging from the</page><page sequence="7">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 237 ceiling only served to heighten the similarities between our predicament and any number of B-grade horror movies I had seen." The same writer continues, "I think I probably covered a very large chunk of north-central Ohio with Nick, through snowstorms, ice, and rain, and I loved every minute of it!" The evidence of Professor P. Nick Kardulias's excellence as an undergraduate teacher of archaeology is abundant and strong, and the Archaeological Institute of America is proud to recognize his passion, commit- ment, and success by giving him the Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching for the year 2002. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA CONSERVATION AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AWARD WET ORGANIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS WORKING GROUP The Governing Board of the Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to present the 2002 Conserva- tion and Heritage Management Award to the Wet Organic Archaeological Materials Working Group (WOAM) of the International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC). Over the past 20 years, WOAM has met regularly to report on research on the conservation of wet archaeological materials that has taken place since the previous meeting. The scope of their work includes not only artifacts, but sites and site monitoring as well. As part of the proceedings, the group sets a research agenda for future work that various members agree to pursue. In this way, current research builds on previous work and determines areas of future work. This serves to reduce redundancy in conservation research as well as to target areas of particular concern. The Group has been responsible for the great strides that have been made in recent years in the understanding and treatment of wet and waterlogged archaeological materials and is therefore deserving of recognition. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA JAMES R. WISEMAN BOOK AWARD LYNN E. ROLLER The Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to give the 2002 James R. Wiseman Book Award to Lynn E. Roller for In Search of God the Mother: the Cult of Anatolian Cybele (Berkeley 1999). To the much-contested study of goddess-worship has come a voice of reason. In Search of God the Mother exposes the assumptions, stereotypes, and misconceptions behind the image of the mother-goddess, and substitutes exact observations, clear arguments, and sound conclusions. Historical in outline and intent, Roller looks to literature, inscriptions, and the material remains to reconstruct the various roles that god the mother played, first in Anatolia, then in the wider worlds of the Mediterranean, and now in modern theories of psychology and history of religion. This is an elegant treatment of a very problematic issue, handled with sensitivity and meticulous attention to detail. It exposes the false assumptions behind the characterization of mother-goddess worship as "primi- tive," and traces the implications for questions of gender and ethnicity in the modern as well as the ancient world. This clearly written, well organized, and handsomely produced book should become a standard.</page><page sequence="8">238 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA OUTSTANDING LOCAL SOCIETY PRIZE CLEVELAND SOCIETY On this fifth day of January 2002, the Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to present the Out- standing Local Society Prize to the Cleveland Society. The Cleveland Society of the AIA is commended for its activity and outreach. Of particular note is the long history of the Society since its founding in 1895. For over 100 years it has provided continuous programming to the Cleveland area, stimulating local residents in their own pursuits of archaeological interest. The Cleveland Society has multiplied the outreach of its lecture programs by having each lecture video- taped and then made available to local high school and college teachers. In addition, a summer program of showing the videotapes at the Cleveland Museum of Art has allowed a second audience to experience the lectures through a film format. The Cleveland Society is further to be commended for its recent establishment of a Field Archaeology Scholarship supported by individual contributions. An intern is thus enabled to spend three weeks in the field and three weeks in an archaeology laboratory.</page><page sequence="9">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 239 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION lA: BURIAL IN THE GREEK AND ROMAN WORLDS THE RICH ATHENIAN LADY WAS PREGNANT: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF A GEOMETRIC TOMB IN THE ATHENIAN AGORA: Maria A. Liston, University of Waterloo, Ontario, and John K. Papadopoulos, TheJ. Paul Getty Museum Discovered in 1967, the so-called Tomb of the Rich Athe- nian Lady, ca. 850 B.C., fully published by Evelyn Smithson in Hesperia (1968), soon became one of the best known of all Greek Geometric burials. The tomb contained a remarkable assemblage of grave gifts, including gold and imported glass jewelry, ivory stamp seals, and an unusual ceramic chest with five model granaries. AlthoughJ. Lawrence Angel initially stud- ied the human remains from most of these burials, he was primarily concerned with the crania, and much of the postcra- nial material was never examined. As part of a new study of the Early Iron Age burials in the area of the Classical Agora, the cremation burials were reexamined, providing additional in- formation on the woman herself. The extraordinary care with which her cremated remains were gathered led to the preser- vation of most of the facial structure, allowing a forensic facial reconstruction. The examination of the postcranial remains identified cremated bone fragments belonging neither to the 30-35 year old woman, nor to the animals burned on her pyre. This new analysis has established that the rich Athenian lady was pregnant or had recently given birth when she died. Al- though shrinkage from cremation complicates the estimation of age, the fetus was probably 30-36 weeks old, at least one month less than full term. This new discovery permits a reas- sessment of status and burial in the period and adds a new dimension to the complex and intriguing story of human dis- posal in the Aegean Early Iron Age. BURIAL IN THE CHORA OF METAPONTO: Joseph Coleman Carter, Institute of Classical Archaeol- ogy, University of Texas at Austin, Maciej Henneberg and Renata Henneberg, University of Adelaide, Australia, and Lucilla Burn, The Brit- ish Museum In 1999, the Institute of Classical Archaeology excavated a small necropoleis in the heart of the Chora of Metaponto, at Pizzica, one dating from the first half of the fifth century B.C. The analysis of the burials is nearly complete. The physical anthropology by the Hennebergs and the stylistic analysis of the figured vases, including five masterpieces of Southern Italian, red-figured vase painting, is in progress and will be completed by 2001. Argument is made that one of the burials contains the clearest evidence yet that the deceased was an adherent of the "Orphic-Pythagorean- Dionysiac" mystical beliefs that flourished in Southern Italy during this period. The relationship between "Orphism," "Pythagoreanism," and the Bacchic mysteries in Southern Italy and elsewhere has been a subject of controversy for well over a century, with much of the discussion devoted to doctrines and doubts about their antiquity. Archaeological discoveries over the last 40 years (the Hipponion gold plate, the Dervenyi papyrus, the inscribed bones from Olbia on the Black Sea) have led some historians of religion (e.g., W. Burhert 1977) to conclude that there were no clear-cut borders between "Ophism" and similar phe- nomena of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. such as the Bacchic initiations and "Pythagoreanism." Recent discoveries of burials in the Chora of Metaponto by Carter (1998) and Bottini (1992) and a representation of Dionysos in the Pantanello Sanctuary reflect the actual behavior of the Mystai and point to the same conclusion. THE NECROPOLIS OF ANDRIAKE: Elif Ugurlu, Anadolu University, Turkey Andriake is the harbor of Myra, which was one of the most important cities in Lycia in ancient times. Myra was surveyed in 1997 and I conducted research in the necropolis of the city. The Andriake necropolis consists of three main parts: north, south, and upper. During the survey, 80 sarcophagi were cata- logued. In the upper necropolis, all of the sarcophagi are the Lykia type. Some of them are carved into rock and some of them are similar to the "chamosorien" type. No inscriptions could be found in the upper necropolis. The earliest date of the usage of the sarcophagi is the Hellenistic period. In the area of the necropolis are some niches and hollows that were carved into rock. They are found very close to the sarcophagus that is interpreted as a possible connection with the cult of the dead. In the south necropolis, there are some inscriptions on the tombs-one of which belongs to a "Naukreros" who was from Nicomedia. The Andriake necropolis is generally dated between the first and third centuries A.D. Sarcophagi that are near the churches show us that they could have been used later. Most of the sarcophagi have been broken and destroyed. In this paper it is claimed that two parts constitute the north necropolis. Moreover, it is evident that the first part is earlier than the other. While the Lykia-type sarcophagi are seen in the first part, the "triangle pediment lids" type is generally seen in the other. Some of them have inscriptions on them that can be read with difficulty. "GHOST MONEY" IN ROMAN CORINTHIAN GRAVES: Mary E.H. Walbank, British School at Athens A detailed examination of burial practices and beliefs at Roman Corinth is in progress, based on material from unpub- lished excavations of 1930-1931 and 1961-1962. Among the grave goods is a number of gold foil impressions, often called "ghost money" or pseudocoins. They have been widely re- corded in funerary contexts in the Peloponnese and Magna Graecia, but since the majority are impressions of Sicyonian coins of Hellenistic date they have always been regarded as</page><page sequence="10">240 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 belonging to that period. However, the Corinthian impres- sions have been found in Roman contexts dating from the first to the fifth century A.D. Their deposition can no longer be regarded as a purely Hellenistic custom nor used to date burials. The gold foil discs come from both chamber tombs and single sarcophagi in different burial grounds. Most were in graves with multiple burials. The contexts show that theywere not "Charon's fee," as is generally thought, nor personal orna- ments, but talismans to protect the dead from harm, and per- haps also used in exorcism. The most popular image remains the Sicyonian dove, a common Greek and Roman symbol of marital affection, but also particularly appropriate at Roman Corinth. The dove also would have been acceptable in a Chris- tian context. Other images appear to have had personal con- notations. A question for discussion is whether the Greek custom of placing gold foil discs in graves was taken over by Roman Corinthians who could afford it, or was it confined to certain families or groups who wished to preserve the tradition. SESSION iB: ANCIENT LANDSCAPES CERAMIC RUBBISH AND RECYCLING IN THE CLAS- SICAL LANDSCAPES OF GREECE: David K. Pettegrew, Ohio State University Over the last decade, ceramic waste has played a surprisingly important role in the literature of classical archaeology in Greece. Many of the broader conclusions from survey archaeology for the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. are drawn from the spread of low-density, "off-site" ceramic material frequently encountered in archaeological surface survey. According to the advocates of the "manuring hypothesis," artifactual domestic rubbish (in- cluding pottery) was dumped in the manure pile outside an urban or rural settlement that was then carted out to the fields and used as fertilizer, thereby transporting the rubbish with the manure. Several sherds per trip to the field would, over time, create the continuous "carpet" of low-density artifact scatter frequently discerned across the Greek landscape today. This paper discusses ancient attitudes and behaviors toward material culture and ceramic waste in the town and countryside of Clas- sical to early Hellenistic Greece. Literary, epigraphic, and ar- chaeological evidence from Attica and other poleissuggests that broken pottery was typically retained in or near the settlement for its potential reuse value. Although ceramics could be re- cycled for a variety of ends, the incorporation of pottery and tiles in the construction of house floors and walls consumed the greatest amounts of discarded items. The significant reuse of ceramics in this way suggests that we look to explanations other than manuring for the existence of off-site scatter across Classi- cal and late Classical landscapes. WHEN IS A STONE OR A STONE CAIRN A HERM? METHODS OF DEFINING TERRITORIAL BOUND- ARIES IN THE PELOPONNESE: Michael D. Dixon, University of Southern Indiana Several ancient sources, both literary and epigraphic, re- fer to the use of stone herms as boundary markers within the Peloponnese during the Hellenistic period. Identification of a single stone or a stone cairn as a herm, however, is not an easy task. In this paper I present an examination of a series of stone cairns that demarcated a territory held in common by Hermion and Epidauros and propose the identification of a single, large stone as one used to define the common terri- tory of Troizen and Arsinoe (Methana). Pausanias (2.36.3) noted the existence of boleoi lithoi, or heaped-up piles of stones, between the territory of Hermion and Epidauros. Further reference to the boleoi lithoi on IG 42.1.75 and SEG 11.377, duplicate records of a settlement between the two states, confirms that these cairns defined a territory held in common by the two states. Although nei- ther source calls the cairns "herms" they fit the model of previously identified stone piles along the border of Tegea, Lakonia, and the Argolid that Pausanias (2.38.7) called herms. According to IG 42.1.76-77, the record of an arbitration between Troizen and Arsinoe (Methana), the "White Herm" was one of several points that defined a territory the two states held in common. I have identified recently a single, large stone near the Methana peninsula as the "White Herm" of the inscription. Several cuttings on the stone itself and its prominent location between Troizen and Methana suggest its identification as the "White Herm." FLUXGATE GRADIOMETRY AND RURAL ARCHAEOL- OGY: THE INVESTIGATION OF ETRUSCAN AND EARLY ROMAN FARM SITES IN CENTRAL ITALY: Kimberly M. Brown, University of Pennsylvania Magnetometry, or more properly "fluxgate gradiometry," is just one of several geophysical prospecting methods currently in use in archaeology (ground-penetrating radar, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility are others, for example). In fact, Mediterranean archaeology has seen a recent flowering of the potential of this intensive and refined form of noninvasive surface survey. It is essentially a systematic program of fieldwalking that articulates the features of both visible and buried remains, and the associative qualities they share. Using the computer images generated with this methodology, we are able to recover, visualize, and interpret formal qualities of the typically subterranean elements that comprise a site and its environment, whether rural or urban. For this paper, I compare the building plans I recovered through magnetom- etry survey at isolated rural locations in northern Lazio and Tuscany to the plans of buildings from known urban centers throughout central Italy. The resulting analysis, a character- ization of specific features of rural and urban habitats, provides an understanding of rural buildings and their urban counter- parts, an area in which we have very little direct evidence. Moreover, I specifically address the ways in which magnetom- etry survey enhances the ability of the archaeologist to infer a population from a surface assemblage that might include pot- tery finds and other types of features. Magnetometry, when combined with conventional landscape surface survey, can be a powerful tool for archaeological research. THE PERIPLUS OF ITALY: STRABO, PLINY, AND THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE XI REGIONS: Ingrid E.M. Edlund-Berry, University of Texas at Austin In their descriptions of the 11 regions of ancient Italy, Strabo (Geography 5.1-6.1) and Pliny (NH3.38-138) provide different means for defining the territory of each, including names of boundary rivers, cities, peoples, and natural features. AccordingtoR. Thomsen, TheltalicRegions (Copenhagen 1947),</page><page sequence="11">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 241 Pliny draws his information about the regions primarily from the census lists of Augustus (3.46) and from descriptions by geogra- phers such as Ptolemy. A comparison of Strabo's and Pliny's narra- tive suggests, however, that their sources fall into three main categories, including Rome-centered political and historical in- formation, general ethnographic accounts, and descriptions of the coastline based on the seafarers' perspective, the periplus. The periplus in particular has archaeological implications in that it provides not only information on cities and promonto- ries, but also on the exact location of the shoreline in antiquity. Thus areas which to us appear to be inland were recognized as coastal, and rivers and lakes were described as dominating the inland to an extent that is today apparent primarily through geology and not topography. As a result of this analysis of Strabo's and Pliny's use of the periplus in their descriptions of ancient Italy, it is thus possible to reconstruct not only the Roman perspective on the different areas of Italy but also the physical setting of the land, the water- ways, the lakes, and the coastline, thereby combining the tradi- tionally Roman interest in the land with the Greek emphasis on the water and the sea as a means of travel and communication. THE ALLUSIVE LANDSCAPE OF HADRIAN'S VILLA AT TIVOLI: Jessica Davis Powers, University of Michigan Certain components of Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli have tradi- tionally been identified by names that refer to sites in Rome's eastern provinces. These identifications are based on the Historia Augusta, according to which parts of the Villa evoked the Ly- ceum, the Academy, the Prytaneum, Canopus, the Stoa Poikile, the Vale of Tempe, and the Underworld (SHA Hadr. 26.5). This paper draws on archaeological and textual evidence to illuminate the creation and reception of the allusive sites lo- cated throughout the Villa's landscape. Seven features are con- sidered, with the Temple ofAphrodite replacing the Prytaneum of the HistoriaAugusta list (W. MacDonald andJ. Pinto, Hadrian's Villa and Its Legacy [New Haven 1995] 7). The allusive elements are approached first from the perspec- tive of Hadrian, as their patron. A personal connection, in the form of travel or benefactions, between emperor and namesake site can be demonstrated for almost all the locales recreated. The paper next discusses the varying ways that Hadrian's visi- tors, both Romans and foreigners, may have responded to these evocative elements. To their viewers these features may have called to mind both Rome's dominance over the provinces and Hadrian's concern for them. Thirdly, Hadrian's Villa is situated in the wider tradition of imperial and private villas, places of retreat and relaxation, with components named after specific sites. These approaches suggest that the allusive landscape of Hadrian's Villa invited potentially conflicting interpretations relating to the importance of the East and Greek culture, the interests of the emperor, and the power of Rome. THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA ARCHAEOLOGI- CAL EXPEDITION TO ITALY: THE CASINUM PROJECT: Farland H. Stanley, Jr., University of Oklahoma In the summer of 2001 an archaeological team from the University of Oklahoma worked in cooperation with Italian colleagues to excavate the ruins of the Roman city of Casinum in Italy. The project is part of a new academic move at the University of Oklahoma to offer its students increased oppor- tunities in classical archaeology through an archaeological field school. These opportunities begin with the Casinum Project and have the goal of scientific inquiry accomplished through teaching. The first site that the OU Archaeological Field School has chosen to excavate is the ancient walled city of Casinum. The site is located in an archaeological park in Monte Cassino and encompasses a large area with attendant impressive urban architectural structures. Ancient literary sources inform us that the city possessed several temples, a basilica, a forum, an am- phitheater, a theater, and other urban structures. However, with the exception of the massive amphitheater and huge theater, little is certain about the location of the other urban structures. To investigate the urban makeup of the city, three Oklahoma teams explored the city. The first team focused on an extensive survey of the site with ground-penetrating radar (GPR). A second team began excavations in the area of a suspected temple. A third team excavated adjacent to the amphitheater in an effort to establish its date of construction. All of the efforts were designed to increase our scientific knowl- edge of the city's early inhabitants and to offer opportunities to students interested in classical archaeology. THE DURRES ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT (ALBA- NIA): Aaron D. Wolpert, Jack L. Davis, and Sharon R. Stocker, University of Cincinnati, and Afrim Hoti and Iris Pojani, International Center for Al- banian Archaeology, Tirana In spring 2001, ajoint Albanian-American team explored uplands north of the modern city of Durres (ancient Durrachium/Epidamnus) as far as the harbor ofPorto Romano (5 km distant). In total a continuous area of approximately 6 km2 was intensively surveyed by two field teams in 14 days of fieldwork. All data collected by the project are stored in elec- tronic form and linked to an electronic DEM. This fieldwork constitutes the first systematic exploration of any part of the hinterland of the ancient city. Research was urgently required. Antiquities are in great danger of destruction because of illegal uncontrolled expansion of the city of Durres since 1991. In general, surface visibility was poor (lower than 30% in most tracts), and there was a strong correlation between localized patterns of erosion and higher artifact densities. Twenty-nine sites were, however, defined in 12 separate catchment zones. Of some 3,200 artifacts collected in the field, the majority were of the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. Fragments of funerary monuments and remnants of grave goods of the Greek period were found in various areas near the modern city. One particularly interesting site may preserve the remains of a hith- erto unknown Greek temple. Material from the Roman period was noticeably underrepresented, although what appear to be the foundations of a late antique and Medieval church were found at Kisha e Kalmi. Significant quantities of Ottoman and early modern pottery were arso recognized. ALL ROADS LEAD TO NEMEA: NEW PHYSICAL EVI- DENCE FOR GREEK ROADS IN THE TERRITORY OF KLEONAI, NORTHEAST PELOPONNESOS: Jeannette Marchand, University of California, Berkeley It is usually argued that the Greeks were not prolific road builders. The study of roads in Greece often consists only of the search for "main roads" mentioned by Pausanias or noted</page><page sequence="12">242 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 on the Peutinger Table. These sources, however, date to the Roman period, when Greece was politically unified and long- distance travel tended to make one road predominant. I ar- gue that autopsy suggests that the Greeks had many more roads for wheeled traffic than usually thought, and that the idea that roads in the chora were built only for military pur- poses or by large, dominant states ignores the evidence of local roads and the realities of classical politics. To illustrate this view, I present new physical evidence in the form of wheel-ruts for three previously unknown major roads leading from the city of Kleonai and the Corinth-Argos road toward the Nemea valley. These roads can be distin- guished to some extent in function and date: one can be dated to the Mycenaean period by its Cyclopean retaining wall; a widened branch of this road apparently served as the direct road from Kleonai to Nemea in the Classical period. The second follows a gentler course, passing well-preserved quarries and following a rock-cut aqueduct for over 0.5 km. The third road is an alternate route allowing travelers from Corinth to bypass their enemy Kleonai's city walls. The new evidence for these roads and others from Kleonai provides significant insight into the polis's history and economy, and suggests that assumptions about Greek road building need reconsideration. SESSION IC: COLLOQUIUM: USING AND SAV- ING THE PAST: CULTURAL HERITAGE AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD IN THE BALKANS ARCHAEOLOGY AND POLITICS: THE IRON AGE IN SLOVENIA: Peter S. Wells, University of Minnesota Societies in the southeast Alpine region of Slovenia have occupied a critical frontier zone for the past 3,000 years. During the Iron Age, trading towns linked cultures of Etruria and northeast Italy to groups throughout the Balkan penin- sula. In the Roman period, this region connected Italy to the frontier provinces along the middle Danube. Since the mid- 19th century, archaeological research here has reflected political changes in Europe. The massive burial mounds at the Early Iron Age towns attracted research attention early, and discoveries in Slovenia played a major role in the cre- ation of our understanding of Iron Age prehistory. During the Cold War, the archaeology of this region at the north- western edge of Yugoslavia integrated western and eastern European traditions of research and interpretation. In the past decade Iron Age archaeology has changed to adapt to the new political, social, and cultural circumstances of post- Cold War Europe. PERFORATED BOUNDARIES: THE REALITY OF STATE IDEOLOGY IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE: Douglass W Bailey, Cardiff University, U.K. In highly centralized political systems, the form of ar- chaeological publication reveals much about official pro- scriptions on the way archaeology must be carried out and, more interestingly, about how archaeologists follow or ig- nore such constraints. In this paper, I compare the post- WWII patterns in archaeological publication from eastern Europe (Romania and Bulgaria) and the west (the U.K. and U.S.). Investigation measures the proportions of national and non-national topics and authors in the major disciplin- ary journals. Analysis aims to answer key questions about the actual relationships between the day-to-day practice of archaeology and the contemporary state doctrines on the practice of an ideologically sensitive discipline. For example, during periods when a government explicitly condemns foreign work and collaboration (as was the case in 1950s Bulgaria), what was the reality on the ground; were stric- tures evident in publication topic and authorship? In other cases (as more recently in Romania), were national reorien- tations toward the West reflected in patterns of archaeo- logical publication? What can one conclude from a similar analysis of contemporary Western trends? Has there been a more open policy toward internationalism in British and American journals? This research has significance for un- derstanding the reality of archaeological practices that un- derlie and quietly contradict explicit state ideologies. CULTURAL HERITAGE AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD IN THE BALKANS: Eugene N. Borza, Penn- sylvania State University (Emeritus) The course of archaeological investigation and its conse- quent contribution to an understanding of the history of the ancient Balkans has been unstable, often in direct con- sequence of the political vicissitudes of the modern Balkans themselves during the last half of the 20th century. The present contribution to the colloquium will survey the gen- eral course of archaeological research in the Balkans north of Greece, and then concentrate on the important excava- tions in Greek Macedonia. Among the points to be consid- ered are: 1. The lack of material evidence indicating Mycenaean settlement (as opposed to Mycenaean imported ware or local imitations) in Macedonia and Epirus. The significance of this conclusion bears directly on the argument suggest- ing that the historical Macedonians had Hellenic origins. 2. The revelation of a rich Macedonian material culture in the historical period, most of the evidence thus far com- ing from the fifth to third centuries B.C. It is significant that this material culture is eclectic, indicating that the Macedonians were not tied to any cultural canon, having borrowed from the Greek south, the Greek east, and the Balkan north. 3. The influence of modern nationalism on the interpre- tation of archaeological evidence, that is, the tendency to use the material evidence of antiquity to bolster modern political ends. 4. The relative isolation from one another in which mod- ern Balkan archaeological services have worked, resulting in the imposition of artificial modern national boundaries on homogeneous cultural regions, which knew no such boundaries in antiquity. THE VIEW FROM SPLIT: Sheila McNally, University of Minnesota The late 1980s promised a fruitful future for archaeological monuments in Split and its region. New parts of Diocletian's</page><page sequence="13">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 243 Palace continually emerged. Its conservation and presenta- tion seemed assured through an agreement between the World Bank and the Yugoslav government. Activities here and elsewhere in the Balkans encouraged me, with others, to propose a major project considering how the late Roman flowering of Split, Gamzigrad, and Thessalonike affected later history. Events of the early 1990s disrupted those plans, and radi- cally adjusted priorities. Most tragically, widespread military damage showed the inability of UNESCO and others to orga- nize protection, although the historic core of Split was spared the damage inflicted on other historic urban centers such as Dubrovnik and Mostar. Long-term reverberations include a breakdown in scholarly interaction. It may be some time be- fore we can again propose to consider the shared past of cities in Croatia, Serbia, and Greece. The impressive positive development was the profound commitment of the people of Split and Croatia to their monu- ments. Support for archaeological investigation never wa- vered, and has probably increased. Exciting new discoveries have occurred. Limited resources for conservation and pre- sentation remain a great concern. International support is again being sought, with some success. The Congress of Early Christian Archaeology, held in Split, reflected renewed re- emphasis on certain scholarly connections. The outlook is more uncertain than it appeared 15 years ago. Most promis- ing is the necessity for reexamining priorities; most alarming is the possibility of proceeding within narrow lines. PICKING UP THE PIECES: HERITAGE SITE CONSER- VATION IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA:John H. Stubbs, World Monuments Fund The Balkan conflicts of the 1990s proved disastrous to the citizens, the economies, and much of the built envi- ronment of former Yugoslavia. Since implementation of "forced peace" in the region, Croatia, Bosnia, and other affected areas are slowly rebuilding. The region possesses a wealth of historic buildings, towns, and archaeological sites dating from Neolithic times. Orga- nized restoration and preservation efforts at monuments including Diocletian's Palace in Split began in the mid 19th century. A variety of sites, often in urban contexts, have been impressively restored. Examples include the other coastal towns of Dubrovnik, Zadar, and Korcula and the inland cities of Zagreb, Belgrade, and Sarajevo. Smaller towns such as Vukovar and Mostar were restored as parts of a heritage tourism network. By the mid 1980s nearly the whole of former Yugoslavia's significant built heritage had been conserved. During the conflicts in 1991-1997, many of the historic towns and settlements of southeastern Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina were laid waste by shelling, vandalism, and the nightmarish policy of ethnic cleansing. Heritage sites were especially targeted, even those marked with UNESCO's Blue Shield insignia indicating protection under the Hague Convention. The World Monuments Fund is among several organiza- tions working in the region offering both financial and tech- nical assistance at restorations in Dubrovnik, Split, and Mostar. More difficult challenges are faced at heavily damaged Vukovar and Pocitelj. The Greco-Roman archaeological site of Butrint, Albania and the synagogue of Subotica, Yugosla- via have also received assistance. SESSION ID: AIA/ASOR JOINT COLLO- QUIUM: THE GALILEE: ARCHAEOLOGY AND EARLY CHRISTIANITY THE GALILEE BOAT: A PORTHOLE INTO THE PAST: Shelley Wachsmann, Institute of Nautical Archae- ology at Texas A&amp;M University In 1986, two brothers from Kibbutz Ginosar discovered the Galilee Boat (a.k.a. the Kinneret Boat, the 'Jesus Boat") en- tirely buried in the seabed of the Sea of Galilee during a severe drought, which lowered the lake's water level. The Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (now the Is- rael Antiquities Authority), aided by numerous volunteers, ex- cavated and rescued the boat in a remarkable 11-day excava- tion. The waterlogged hull, secured in a fiberglass and poly- urethane cocoon successfully sailed intact to the nearbyYigal Allon Centre, where it underwent an extensive conservation period and where it is now exhibited in its own exhibition hall. The boat is preserved to a length of 8.2 m, a breadth of 2.3 m, and a height of 1.2 m. The vessel was constructed in the contemporaneous "shell-based" method, with edge-joined planking attached with pegged mortise-and-tenon joints. Iron nails hold frames to the hull. Numerous repairs, the frequent utilization of timbers in secondary use, and the multiplicity of wood types evident in the hull all suggest that this vessel had a long work life and an owner of meager means. The boat dates to the first centuries B.C.-A.D. An analysis of crew sizes suggests that this is the type of boat referred to in the Gospels in use among Jesus' disciples, as well as that used by theJews against the Romans in the nautical Battle of Migdal in A.D. 67. Thus, this humble vessel supplies a remarkable, and at present unique, view of Galilean seafaring in antiquity. THE DEATH OF HEROD AND THE NEW DIVIDE IN GALILEE: Andrea M. Berlin, University of Minnesota The death of Herod the Great in 4 B.C.E. is generally regarded as a nonevent in terms of the character of village life in Galilee. Archaeologists do not distinguish Herodian and post-Herodian settlement patterns, trade and market routes, or the types of material goods found in these levels in the region's many small villages. Close inspection of the evi- dence provides a different picture, however: certain aspects of material life did change dramatically in the years following Herod's death. What is the nature of that change? Prior to and during Herod's reign, an easily discernable system of market routes linked the Galilee'sJewish and Gen- tile sites, which therefore contained a similar array of house- hold goods. In the years following, however, while the evi- dence reveals that those routes remained the same, it also appears thatJews deliberately refrained from purchasing one particular type of Phoenician-supplied ceramic: the red-slipped plates and bowls known commonly as Eastern Sigillata A (ESA). At the same time, Phoenicians and other gentile groups did not purchase Galilean food products, as indicated by the ab- sence of an otherwise widely distributed storage container made in the Galilean site of Shikhin. What can account for this pattern? Neither political nor economic shifts provide a satisfactory explanation. Rather, the data reflect a situation presented by several early Christian</page><page sequence="14">244 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 authors, and especially emphasized by the author of the Gospel ofMark: a sudden "lifestyle" divide betweenJews and non-Jews (whether characterized as Phoenicians or Gentiles). SEPPHORIS AND THE EARLIEST CHRISTIAN CON- GREGATIONS: James E Strange, University of South Florida Nowhere in the records of Christianity from 35-70 C.E. is Sepphoris or Tiberias mentioned as a Christian center. On the other hand, Capernaum was the headquarters ofJesus. The curse on Capernaum in Luke 10:15 suggests that early Chris- tian communities did not develop at Capernaum. Sepphoris, on the other hand, appears to have been a stronghold of Judaism in the early centuries. Fr6deric Manns developed the thesis that Sepphoris was a bastion ofJewish-Christianity. If so, then it may be no surprise that this history was suppressed by later Gentile Christian writers. Speculation whetherJesus trav- eled to and from Sepphoris as a boy or even as an adult will not pay dividends. Yet, the excavations at Sepphoris reveal enough of the early material culture to argue to what extent early Christian communities might have thrived at Sepphoris. The results of excavations at Sepphoris to date tend to contribute to a view of a city which exhibits some Roman (not necessarily "Hellenistic") elements in public space, but much less so in private space, which in fact appears to be Jewish. If so, then the development ofaJewish-Christian community at Sepphoris is not ruled out. In fact, since archaeology seems to document both accommodation and resistance to Roman institutions, Sepphoris may have been an ideal environment for the devel- opment ofaJewish-Christian presence meeting in homes until 70 C.E. That the author of Mark has a geographical viewpoint from the west and north of Galilee tends to support such a hypothesis. KHIRBET CANA: TRANSFORMATIONS OF A SMALL TOWN IN LOWER GALILEE IN THE HELLENISTIC THROUGH BYZANTINE PERIODS: Douglas R. Edwards, University of Puget Sound "Urbanocentric" biases have often governed the study of ancient societies, notably for historical periods. Towns and villages of small size and occupation offer more controlled ways to discern the larger political economy, the ways in which social forms of ranking and segmentation pervaded the day- to-day life of all members of society, and the extent to which small settlements connected to larger regional and interna- tional commercial and cultural spheres. Excavations and an extensive site survey of Khirbet Cana, a medium-sized site roughly 800 m by 300 m, began in 1997 in order to address these issues as they relate to lower Galilee in Israel. Khirbet Cana is situated in the center of the lower Galilee along an important east-west corridor, the Bet Netofa Valley. The site's close proximity to significant urban centers and numerous villages make it an ideal site to gauge the inter- action between urban areas and the countryside. The central location of the site made it attractive from the Hellenistic through Byzantine period as indicated through ceramic, nu- mismatic, and architectural evidence. This paper examines the site's three significant architectural and cultural transfor- mations: Late Hellenistic/Early Roman, Late Roman/Early Byzantine, and the Late Byzantine period. The town moved from local and regional to international importance in the Byzantine period as literary and archaeological evidence indi- cate the site functioned as a Christian pilgrimage site as early as the fifth century C.E. THE JEWISH SETTING OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF GALILEE: Eric M. Meyers, Duke University Recent excavations in the Galilee at such places as Sepphoris, Bethsaida, Jotapata, Cadasa, and Capernaum, to name but a few, have strengthened the idea that the heart- land of Galilee was overwhelminglyJewish in character from the first century B.C.E in many places to the peak of the rabbinic period in the fourth century C.E. Such a conclusion is supported by the material culture reflected in coins, lamps, architecture, and epigraphical remains. While there is still discussion about the pagan borders of the area, and how far some of those communities or suburbs of metropolitan areas would have encroached upon the Jewish heartland, the basic contours ofJewish Galilee in the Roman period are now well- established. Because of the "invisible" nature of the earliest evidence of Christianity in the Galilee scholars are hard-pressed to deter- mine where the earliest remains of Christianity are to be lo- cated. Capernaum provides the clearest corpus of data on this matter and Christian presence there from the first century onward cannot be doubted. But it is from the time after Constantine's conversion, ca. 312 C.E., that most of the Chris- tian expansion may be dated, and hence when we speak of Christian settlements in the Galilee, except for a few excep- tions, we are speaking about fourth century and later, or the Byzantine period. Western Galilee in particular and venerated holy places are where the best preserved Christian remains are to be found. The impact of the pagan cities that surround the Galilee on the material culture and character of sites in Galilee will also be considered. Beth Shean (Scythopolis) is among the most important of those cities, but the cities of the Decapolis, Acco/ Ptolemais, and Tyre are all important in this regard as well. The excavations at Bethsaida and Cadasa shed new light on the encroachment of Syrian and Phoenician culture respectively on various places in Galilee. SESSION 1E: COLLOQUIUM: NEW DIREC- TIONS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MAPPING, GIS, AND REMOTE SENSING Loss OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL MEMORY IN THE LAND- SCAPE IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH-CENTRAL ITALY: Umberto Moscatelli, Universita di Macerata, Italy The principle aim of the paper is to highlight the phenom- ena of degradation of the archaeological heritage and histori- cal memory in the modern landscape. Intense landscape ex- ploitation, due both to modern building and agricultural and industrial activities, have severely changed the quantity and quality of the archaeological record on the surface of the ground. Examples of loss of archaeological memory in Italian contexts are presented, for instance in central and south-</page><page sequence="15">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 245 central Italy, specificallyAbruzzo (Sangro RiverValley), Marche (Fiastra River Valley and Asculum), Umbria, Lazio, and Toscana. The mapping and analysis of such destructive factors within a GIS point out the difficulties that the researcher faces in the application of intensive studies of landscape archaeology. The last part of the paper illustrates several GIS applications for the treatment of archival data, both in the reconstruction of the degradation of the historical landscape and in supporting re- search focused on Medieval period landscapes. THE MEDIEVAL COUNTRYSIDE OF THE NORTH- WESTERN PELOPONNESE, GREECE: STRATEGIES OF ANALYSIS AND DOCUMENTATION: Kostis Kourelis, University of Pennsylvania Recent archaeological fieldwork in the northwestern Peloponnese reveals a countryside permeated with deserted Medieval villages. Ignored thus far by both architectural histo- rians and archaeologists, these inconspicuous monuments present new methodological problems in the study of histori- cal landscapes. Material from the Morea Project (F.A. Cooper andJ. D. Alchermes, directors), a survey of Medieval and mod- ern vernacular architecture, is here used to address problems of data collection and geographic analysis. Medieval settle- ments in Greece have escaped scholarly attention on account of the practical difficulties in surveying them by traditional methods. Located in a remote mountainous terrain, these settlements survive only as rubble ruins beneath dense under- growth each containing as many as 300 houses over a distance as great as a kilometer. Mapping such sites was possible by GPS surveying, while methods of remote sensing and spectral analy- sis have aided in the recognition and prospection of previously unknown sites. Since Medieval archaeology in Greece does not yet consti- tute a discipline of its own, it has not developed adequate interpretive methodologies for the study of the rural land- scape. An attempt to reconstruct the Medieval Peloponnesian countryside offers a unique opportunity to assess the diverse historiographic traditions that have born on its study, as well as to suggest new directions in research. Sources as disparate as Medieval chronicles, early modern travelers, inscriptions, de- mographic data, archaeological surveys, excavations, and ar- chitectural studies are brought together into a case study of historical geography made possible by GIS applications. LOCATING THE ADMINISTRATIVE OUTPOST OF THE WORKMEN'S VILLAGE IN WESTERN THEBES (EGYPT) USING GIS: Andrewj. Koh, University of Pennsylvania Museum Past discussion on the administrative outpost of Deir el- Medina has focused on the role of that facility in supply and administration of the workmen's village. Opinion has varied significantly, however, on the actual physical location of the outpost. Suggestions have ranged from the immediate north of the town's main entrance to a location adjacent to the Ramesseum. In his study of P. Turin (1923), R. Ventura has shown the importance of ancient survey measurements in recording the elevation of the outpost relative to the Ramesseum and a well dug during the reign of Ramesses VI. This well, likely equivalent with the Great Pit excavated by B. Bruyfre, and the Ramesseum provide reference points in es- tablishing the probable location of the outpost. Employing recent geographical information systems studies based on the CEDAE map of the Theban Necropolis combined with low altitude aerial photographs from the 1960s, the location of the outpost can be determined with ahigh degree of probabil- ity to lie at the northeastern edge of the Qurnet Murai and facing the Ramesseum. In particular it is postulated that the outpost was situated within 250 m of the northeastern corner of the Ptolemaic Hathor temple, putting it in the immediate proximity of the village and not the Ramesseum. This conclu- sion is supported by organizational similarities with the East- ern Village at Amarna, the distribution of Ramesside adminis- trative ostraca at Deir el-Medina, and topographical observa- tions. The latter is further supported by remote sensing opera- tions performed on the target area using Image Analyst, an extension of ArcView GIS. CUSTOMIZED TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT KOTYITI, NEW MEXICO: Nicholas L. Stapp, University of Pennsylvania Museum Modern archaeological research should incorporate tech- nology that is customized to the needs of researchers, and more specifically to the needs of a site. Using the Native American pueblo site of Kotyiti, New Mexico, as a case study, use of customized technology will be discussed. The technol- ogy customized to study Kotyiti included GIS, CAD, remote sensing, and 3-D visualization. This is a collaborative research project between the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Pueblo of Cochiti. The site of Kotyiti was a fortified village, strategically posi- tioned on top of a mesa in northern central New Mexico. Kotyiti is well known as one of the centers of resistance during the Pueblo Revolt and Spanish Reconquest Periods, 1680- 1694. Descendants currently use Kotyiti for ceremonial visits before tribal hunting trips, for outdoor education for the chil- dren of descendants, and as a symbol of the strength and honor of ancestors. A combination of GIS, CAD, remote sensing, and 3-D visu- alization was employed to enhance the study of Kotyiti and to create two- and three-dimensional maps of the site and its cultural landscape. These maps offer unusual precision, as they combine accurate topographical data, overlaid aerial and satel- lite imagery, and detailed digital surveyed data. The results of this research are providing new information regarding the organization of site structure during this Pueblo Revolt period. A STONE-FOR-STONE DIGITAL MAP OF ROMAN CORINTH, GREECE: David Gilman Romano, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Museum The work of the Corinth Computer Project, since 1987, has been involved with the study and evolution of the city plan and landscape of Roman Corinth. One of the goals of the research project has been the creation of a stone-for-stone digital map of the entire city, excavated since 1896 by the Corinth Excavations of the American School of Classical Stud- ies at Athens. Now nearing completion, this highly accurate map incorporates the actual-state drawings of each of the excavated buildings, monuments, and structures of the an- cient city, Roman as well as Greek, Hellenistic, Byzantine, Frankish, Venetian, Turkish, and modern. Each of the draw-</page><page sequence="16">246 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ings have been digitized and geo-referenced with respect to an electronic total station survey (undertaken by the Corinth Computer Project, 1988-1997) of the above-ground monu- ments and structures of the city. The digital map creates a never before seen plan of the entire excavated city. Each drawn line in the digital map incorporates three different kinds of information: chronology, physical characteristics, and function. The Roman city may be seen in terms of the development and evolution of the city plan emperor by em- peror. This digital map creates a completely new tool for use in the study of the ancient city and is unique. Aspects of this digital map are now online at the Corinth Computer Project Web site: http://corinth.sas.upenn. edu. A VIRTUAL VISITATION OF LEMON HILL, FAIR- MOUNT PARK: Mark Davison, University of Penn- sylvania The virtual visitation of Lemon Hill, Fairmount Park is a culmination of many sources of data and multiple methods in- cluding 2-D digital mapping, historic stills, 3-D modeling, geo- rectified data, digital video, animation, and satellite imagery. The multidimensional application of current technology allows the viewer to explore a landscape through time and space. This project, led by the author as a landscape architect, working for the Cartographic Modeling Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, was completed under the guid- ance of the principle investigator, Dana Tomlin, Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning, University of Pennsylvania. The methodology used in the application of the technology for various aspects of the project relied upon techniques established at the Corinth Computer Project of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, under the auspices of David Romano. The site used for the project was Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, with particular emphasis placed upon the parcel of land known as Lemon Hill. Data from 1870 was juxtaposed with the year 2000. The results give us a detailed account of the period of significance for Lemon Hill, compared with present day conditions. The focus of the project has been to explore the adaptation of various software platforms to analyze the cultural landscape in order to exemplify how digital technology can assist in the archiving, analysis, evaluation, maintenance, interpretation, and treatment alternatives for a particular site. The project Web site offers a short description of the project that can be separated into four sections: time maps that deal with the analysis of 2-D digital, hardcopy, and satellite maps; view maps, which look at the comparison of various images both 2-D and 3-D; space and time maps as a combination of various forms of data, which allow the user to move through the space both physically and metaphorically; and finally the treatment alter- native maps allow for comparison between various solutions to a site. The treatment maps can project forward in time to visualize the spaces that the alternative models would create. The purpose of creating a digitally based cultural landscape report is to allow for a virtual visitation of a site or project in terms of both space and time. The digital database can be applied to awide variety of uses such as an archive, an interpre- tation guide for the public, and a tool for making manage- ment decisions in general and in effect enhancing all mainte- nance procedures. It documents the present, which is archived as the past, and can envision the future of a cultural landscape using diverse and complicated sets of data. SESSION iF: COLLOQUIUM: VEHICLES OF IDENTITY, VALUES OF EXCHANGE: ART, COMMERCE, AND IDEOLOGY IN THE AEGEAN BRONZE AGE SIR ARTHUR EVANS AND THE POPULAR PRESS: John C. McEnroe, Hamilton College From the time of their inception in 1900, Arthur Evans's excavations at the "Palace of Minos" at Knossos were reported in newspapers, popularjournals, and books intended for the general reader. However, a bibliographic review shows that this early press coverage was minor in comparison to what would happen in the 1920s, long after the major excavations at the site had been completed. In the 1920s archaeologywas suddenly big news. "Tutmania" swept Europe and America. New discoveries at Ur, Mohenjo Daro, and elsewhere captured the public imagination. Estab- lished journals devoted increasing space to archaeology, and new magazines such as Discovery were founded. The develop- ment of the half tone printing process allowed the popular press to present photographs of spectacular objects and dra- matic events. This new media attention had a profound effect on Evans when he launched a new campaign at Knossos in 1922. Soon more photogenic Minoan objets d'art-nearly all of them fake-appeared in the popular press than ever before. At Knossos the reinforced concrete reconstructions of 1928-1930 were on an entirely new scale and were addressed to a new audience. They were not required for conservation; rather, Evans tells us, they were intended "for the education of the public," and helped to inaugurate the "Heritage industry." The issue raises important questions: How do diverse audi- ences shape what scholars do? Can we balance our responsibili- ties to the past with our responsibilities to the present? OBSIDIAN AND QUARTZ IN SPHAKIA: Lucia Nixon, Magdalen College The Sphakia Survey, co-directed by Jennifer Moody and Lucia Nixon, is an interdisciplinary archaeological project whose main objective is to reconstruct the sequence of human activ- ity in a remote and rugged part of Crete, from ca. 3000 B.C. until A.D. 1900. Obsidian is found at a number of sites in Sphakia with a prehistoric phase. Macroscopic inspection suggests that this obsidian is Melian. Obsidian is more common at sites with an earlier phase (Final Neolithic-Early Minoan), where it is of- ten found in association with worked quartz. In later prehis- toric phases (Early-Middle Minoan), chert is more commonly used, and quartz occurs less frequently. The lithics from Sphakia, including the obsidian, were studied by Lucy Wilson. I have studied the association of obsidian and quartz. In this paper I begin with the overall distribution of obsid- ian in Sphakia. Next I look more closely at obsidian from sites at three different altitudes in Sphakia: down near the coast near Khora Sphakion, which Dr. Wilson suggests is the point of entry for Sphakiote obsidian; at the middle altitude of 800 masl near the mountain plain ofAnopoli; and up in the White Mountains. I discuss the associated lithic materials (especially the quartz) and pottery from these sites as a means of consid- ering the value of obsidian and its role in the local economy. My conclusion touches on comparative material from other</page><page sequence="17">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 247 sites in western Crete such as Nerokourou, and the situation on Melos in the relevant prehistoric periods. MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN ARCHITECTURE AT PYLOS: Michael C. Nelson, College of Visual Arts, St. Paul, Minnesota When Carl Blegen uncovered the walls of the Main Build- ing of the Late Bronze Age palace at Pylos, he noticed their striking similarity to Minoan architecture. The finely cut and coursed ashlar masonry laid in several different styles, multiple recesses and setbacks in facade walls, mortises for securing wooden string courses, and the double-ax mason's mark all find direct parallels in earlier and contemporary buildings and structures of Crete. When Lord William Taylour excavated the Grave Circle at Pylos, which lies about 145 m south-southwest of the palace, he too noted the Minoan-like qualities of some of the burials and artifacts. The pithos style of burial and the Minoanizing or imported Minoan pottery indicated to him that a few of the tomb's occupants may have been "natural- ized" Minoans. A reevaluation of the architecture at Pylos reveals two basic and distinctive chronological phases in the LBA. The first is a time when Pylian architecture, particularly stone masonry, re- sembles Minoan building methods. The second phase post- dates the Late Helladic IIIA period and the architecture is Mycenaean, which includes a centrallylocated, large megaron. The transition in architecture and building techniques that occurred at Pylos is reminiscent of the change from Minoan to Mycenaean cultural dominance that swept through the Aegean in the LBA. It suggests that Pylos was once within the Minoan community, perhaps simply by proximity, but then quickly and abruptly became Mycenaean. ISLAND RITE OR INTERNATIONAL SPORT? DEPIC- TIONS OF BULL GAMES IN THE MINOR ARTS FROM CRETE AND ABROAD IN THE LATE BRONZE AGE: Dawn Cain, University of Toronto Bull leaping may be the most publicized and least under- stood cultural artifact of Late Bronze Age Crete. Wall paint- ings depicting lithe figures wearing cod pieces and high boots, long dark hair marking their trajectory as they vault over the backs of bulls shown in full gallop, have become the leitmotif of Minoan society since its discovery by archaeologist Arthur Evans in the early 20th century. Abbreviated depictions of bull sports are preserved more frequently on portable objects like sealstones, sealings, and rings found on the island as well as on the Greek mainland. Famous gold cups from a tomb atVapheio, Greece, relate the most expansive narrative we possess of the bull games. Along with frescoes of the theme unearthed at Mycenae and Tiryns, the cups also suggest an interest in and familiarity with bull games that have traditionally been associ- ated exclusively with Crete. The occurrence of representa- tions of bull acrobatics on sealstones from Syria-Palestine and recently discovered ritual vessels from Anatolia complicate the received impression of bull leaping as a defining feature of Minoan ritual and society. This paper explores the evidence for bull sports in the so-called minor arts of Crete and her neighbors, touching on aspects of chronology, iconography, and meaning within the international context of trade and exchange that prevailed in the LBA. MILETUS AND THE MESARA: Amy E. Raymond, Uni- versity of Toronto Middle Minoan sealstones, Kamares fine ware, and Mesaran polychrome ware are among the Cretan imports found in the Middle Bronze Age deposits at the eastern Aegean site of Miletus. These imports occur in greater number and in a greater variety at Miletus than MM IB-II imports found elsewhere east of Crete, and now there is evidence for an even stronger relationship between the Milesian and Cretan populations. In this paper I explore three ways in which Milesian ceramic production reflects practices associated with Crete. First, re- gionally made domestic wares from Miletus occur in Minoan shapes, corresponding with the Protopalatial period in Miletus III and the Neopalatial period in Miletus IV. Second, Anatolian red slip burnished ware is found at Miletus in a shape that is unique in southwestern Anatolia but is well-known in MM assemblages, the carinated cup. And, finally, a MBA Milesian kiln excavated in the 2000 season appears to have more in common with Cretan kilns, such as the LM LA kiln at Kommos in the Mesara, than it does with other MBA Anatolian kilns, such as that at Kocabastepe. I conclude that ceramic technol- ogy as well as pottery was exchanged between the eastern Aegean and Cretan cultures, as exemplified in the material from Miletus and the Mesara. AEGEAN LANDSCAPE PAINTING AS A VEHICLE OF IDENTITY: Anne P Chapin, Brevard College Today, Neopalatial Minoan landscape painting is widely rec- ognized for its characteristic depiction of the natural world and is easily distinguished from contemporary Egyptian and Near Eastern landscape through its energetic style and singu- lar focus on the world of nature. This paper examines Neopalatial landscape painting as an expression of Minoan ethnicity and argues that the art form is emblematic of Minoan cultural self-definition. The spread of landscape art across the Aegean suggests the impact of Minoan ethnicity-with its ideals, cultural priorities, religious beliefs, and political struc- tures-on the populations of the Aegean islands. The result- ing variations in landscape art across the Aegean thus preserve visual statements of religious, cultural, and perhaps even po- litical interactions with the Minoan elite power structure while at the same time proclaiming their own local styles and re- gional identities. Taken together, Aegean landscape painting served to establish and define the shifting boundaries of the Minoan sphere of influence in cultural interactions through- out the Aegean. The presence of landscape art in the broader Mediterranean archaeological record also suggests that the art form played an important role in the material interplay between Aegean populations and the cultures of Egypt and the Near East. SESSION 1G: WORKSHOP: APPROACHES TO TEACHING THE ANCIENT CITY Over the last century, our approaches to studying the an- cient world have multiplied and diversified in response to the wealth of primary data produced by excavation and survey. Many disciplines and specialized fields of research now con- tribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the past</page><page sequence="18">248 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 than was previously possible. While the strong interest in an- cient civilizations is reflected in the broad range of courses offered at colleges and universities, techniques for incorporat- ing new discoveries and developments into the context of an undergraduate curriculum are not always apparent or available to everyone. One way to demonstrate the advances in our knowl- edge is to focus on the ancient city. This workshop explores pedagogical approaches to teaching the ancient city using a variety of conceptual frameworks and integrating material from multiple disciplines. By bringing together teachers from differ- ent areas of geographical and technical expertise, this work- shop will present avenues for exploring ancient cities and pro- vide an opportunity to discuss class design in an informal con- text. Participants will give a short presentation (ca. 15 minutes) explaining their instructional goals and approaches. The discus- sants will comment on the contribution of each talk and pro- mote dialogue among the panel and the workshop participants.

THE PUNIC "MARSEILLES TARIFF" (CIS 1.165; KAI 69) AND ITS GREEK COUNTERPARTS: Eran Lupu, Tel Aviv University, Israel The so-called Marseilles tariff, one of the most substantial inscriptions in the Phoenico-Punic corpus, was discovered at Marseilles in 1844. This document, which identifies itself as a sacrificial tariff, lists sacrificial victims, the type of offering, and details regarding the distribution of the parts between the priests (who may also receive money) and the worshippers who offer the sacrifice. It ends with miscellaneous regulations related to sacrifice. Similarities-and differences-between the sacrificial system evident in the Marseilles tariff and the one dealt with by the Levitical code were noted at once. The obvious link between the two systems gained further support with the discovery of Ugaritic tablets. Connections between the Marseilles tariff and Greek sacred laws have been noted. The Marseilles tariff is somewhat similar to sacrificial tariffs featured in a number of Greek sacred laws although the sacri- ficial system it regulates is different. But it shares something more basic and general with Greek sacred laws, namely, the regulation of cult through rules inscribed on stones that are set up publicly where cultic activity would take place. One can argue that this is done not for the benefit of cult personnel but for the worshippers. It informs them of their duties and, moreover, rights, allowing them to check the actions of cultic personnel and thus truly establishing them as an interested party in the performance of cult. THE STRUGGLE FOR APOLLO: THE AITOLIAN SOTERIA AT DELPHI AND THE ANTIGONID SOTERIA AT DELOS: Craige B. Champion, Syracuse University Aitolians worked to counter their unsavory reputation in the Greekworld. This cultural politics centered around Delphi, and in particular the Aitolian role in the repulse of a Gallic attack against the sanctuary in 279 B.C.E. In the recognition decrees for the reorganized, penteteric Delphic Soteria, Aitolia represented itself as savior of Delphi, dramatically asserting claims to Hellenic legitimacy. This propaganda, aimed at secur- ing Aitolian "Hellenism," was doomed to failure, as Aitolian maritime raids actually began on a large scale in the late 250s and early 240s, hitting the Cyclades particularly hard. Antigonos Gonatas worked out a lasting modus vivendiwith the Aitolian Confederation. In light ofAitolian maritime raid- ing in the Aegean and particularly in the Cyclades in the 240s, we may read his establishment of a Soteria festival at Delos in 245 B.C.E. as a politico-cultural response to the Aitolian Del- phic Soteria. Antigonos's Soteria at Delos, the mythical birth- place of Apollo, may well have been a response to Aitolian influence at Delphi, home of Apollo's oracle, which served to distance Makedonia from an ally whom many Greeks consid- ered to be little better than barbarians. While Antigonos liber- ated Delos from Ptolemaic control, he also guaranteed safety from Aitolian privateering raids. This reading gains strength from J.D. Morgan's study of Athenian metonic cycles, which would push Polyeuktos's archonship (and hence the inaugura- tion of the Aitolian penteteric Soteria) to 250/49, allowing Gonatas ample time to respond to the Aitolian Soteria at Delphi with his own at Delos. GREEKS, ROMANS,JEWS, AND OTHERS IN IUDAEA/ SYRIA PALAESTINA: "A CIVILIZATION OF EPIG- RAPHY":JERUSALEM AND CAESAREA: Hannah M. Cotton, The Hebrew University, Israel, and JonathanJ. Price, Tel Aviv University, Israel The myriad languages and local cultures of the ancient Near East, as well as their interaction with the successive em- pires which dominated the region, left indelible traces in the epigraphic evidence, whose full richness is realized only by studying the inscriptions in different languages together. This is the idea behind the creation of the first comprehensive multilingual (Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, Nabataean, Syriac, Thamudic, and Safaitic) corpus of all in- scriptions, both published and unpublished, from the fourth century B.C.E. to the seventh century C.E., from present-day Israel-the Corpus Inscriptionum ludaeae/Palaestinae (CIIP), being prepared in Israel and Germany. The inscriptions will be arranged by site; each site in turn is arranged according to its own inner logic, taking due account of chronology, the unity of a building complex, and subject matter. Jerusalem offers perhaps the richest epigraphic testimony, representing a chronological span extending far beyond the</page><page sequence="19">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 249 parameters of the CLIP. Bringing together in one place the over 1,000 inscriptions in several languages from Jerusalem will at once provide a picture of the imprint left on the city by successive political entities as well as the complex and ever- changing cultural and demographic mosaic there. The variety and depth of the epigraphic finds in Jerusalem will be illus- trated by a sample of texts in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Ara- maic, including dedicatory inscriptions set up by Roman sol- diers stationed there; epitaphs byJews and Christians; dedica- tory inscriptions documenting the Temple, synagogues, and churches; and graffiti illustrating transient hopes and beliefs. The Latin and Greek inscriptions from Caesarea, the seat of the Roman government in Iudaea/Syria-Palaestina, offer a unique testimony of the separate functioning of the senato- rial and equestrian administrative organs in a Roman province during the first three centuries C.E. In addition they demon- strate the upward mobility of the municipal aristocracy of the colony and its integration into the imperial upper classes.

SESSION 1J: POSTER SESSION RECONSTRUCTING MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE AT PALIK1E (MINEO, SICILY): Brian E. McConnell, Soprintendenza BB.CC.AA di Catania, Italy, and Learning Sites, Inc., Williamstown, Massa- chusetts Completion of a major project at ancient Palike (Mineo, Sicily) enables us to evaluate the architecture of this indig- enous Sikel sanctuary. Excavation by the Superintendency of Catania, presented in the AIA colloquium "Exploration of the Sikel Heartland" (San Diego 2001), continues through this spring, and this poster presents complete reconstructions of four monumental buildings. The fifth-century B.C. layout of the site, with two stoas (B and FA) and a hestiaterion set on terraces ascending toward the dramatic backdrop of a large cave, clearly anticipates design concepts of later, Hellenistic sanctuaries. Both stoas faced a plain where natural, "boiling" lakes were the heart of the sanctuary described by Diodorus Siculus (11.89), and offered space for a variety of purposes to a wider "public." The hestiaterion erected in ashlar blocks with a columned entranceway, instead, stood on a higher terrace which may have been reserved for functionaries and invited guests or representatives. Avirtual reality reconstruction pre- pared by Learning Sites (and set up next to the poster) will permit visitors to experience the treatment of interior space and exterior panorama. The use of a "Sikel foot" (0.255 m) derived from the measurements of the hestiaterion would seem confirmed in the length of Stoa B, while the coherent design of the sanctuary suggests that it was administered by the kind ofauthoritywhich is intimated in the textofDiodorus. The subsequent creation of a peristyle court on a raised plat- form is consistent with the design of Italic sanctuaries at Terracina, Palestrina, and Rome. THE METAPONTO ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY: THE 2001 FIELD SEASON: Stephen M. Thompson, Insti- tute of Classical Archaeology, University of Texas at Austin This report will present the results of the 2001 season of field survey in the rural territory of Greek Metaponto, south- ern Italy. Continuing work begun in 2000, a principal com- ponent of this season's research will be the systematic resur- vey of selected areas first covered in the early 1980s. Coupled with a program of local informant interviewing, this field- work aims to both document and quantify the transforma- tional effects of a range of specific agricultural regimes upon the surface archaeology of the region over a relatively long (by research standards) time span. The other main focus of this season's work to be summarized in this report will be the systematic coverage of thus far unsurveyed portions of the southern Metapontino between the Basento and Cavone Rivers. HADRIAN AND THE URBAN RENEWAL OF CUMAE:J. Rufus Fears, University of Oklahoma This paper presents the results of three summers of field study of the Roman remains at the Italian site of Cumae. It focuses on the temples on the acropolis, offering new dates for their reconstruction, placing this renovation into a vi- able historical context, and relating it to a broader program of urban renewal at Cumae. A careful study of the design of these temples offers significant evidence for the process by which innovative architectural forms and ideas radiated from Rome to other parts of Italy and the empire at large. Quite apart from architectural history, the Imperial remains at Cumae provide important new insights into the religious policy of the emperor Hadrian. The acropolis at Cumae is dominated by two temples, origi- nally built in the Greek period, probably at the beginning of the fifth century B.C. during the tyranny of Aristodemus. The lower temple was dedicated to Apollo. A sacred way led from it to the temple on the summit, traditionally ascribed to Zeus. Both temples were reconstructed in the Roman pe- riod, and the lower temple was reoriented. The date and character of these renovations have baffled generations of archaeologists. There lingers a romantic tendency to associ- ate them with Vergil and Augustus. The present paper devel- ops careful criteria, based on constructional techniques and epigraphical evidence, to date these renovations accurately. The result is to place them securely in the Antonine period, specifically in the reign of Hadrian. The renovations were part of a broader building program at Cumae under Hadrian andAntoninus Pius. A sumptuously appointed bath complex so closely resembles the Forum Baths at Ostia as to suggest that the same architect designed both. Even more notewor- thy is the barrel-vaulted apsed temple, resting on a high podium, erected in this period at the eastern end of the forum. Its closest architectural counterpart is the Temple of the Deified Hadrian in Rome. The renovation of the temples on the acropolis at Cumae reflects the broader religious policy by which Hadrian sought to reinvigorate traditional cults. The paper concludes by drawing parallels between Hadrian's renovation of the oracular site of Apollo at Cumae and his program of architectural and religious revitalization of the oracle ofApollo at Delphi.</page><page sequence="20">250 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FORTVNA: THE CURRENT STATE OF DEVELOP- MENT: Chrystina Hduber and Franz Xaver Schiitz, Universitit Bonn, Germany After the joint AIA/APA workshop at the annual meeting in 2001, which brought together partners of the project for the first time, the purpose of this poster presentation is to concentrate on the discussion of the functionalities of the information system (functionalities of CAD, DB, and GIS softwares). We have been developing FORTVNA since 1994; in 2000 the prototype was ready and since 2001 we are prepar- ing the beta version of the software. One of the aims is to develop a user-friendly tool, which is why discussions with fu- ture users, for example archaeologists and/or ancient histori- ans, are of the greatest importance. We have developed FORTVNA as an interactive tool to assist the topography stu- dent to: (1) access information regarding a given ancient Roman structure and its associated materials, and (2) have a basis to understand and interpret the information. Partners in this project are the archaeological agencies of the City of Rome and university professors of classical archaeology, an- cient history, classics, and GIS from Bonn, New Brunswick, and Perugia. FORTVNA offers the opportunity to: (1) search for "persistent" ancient structures, and (2) reconstruct an- cient buildings and landscapes more precisely than previous methods. The first area tested with this system is that of the Mons Oppius in Rome. E. La Rocca of the Sovraintendenza BB.CC. of the City of Rome has provided us with the most important maps of Rome in digital vector format. A NEW RECONSTRUCTION OF OCTAVIAN'S PA- LATINE COMPIEx: Caroline K. Quenemoen, Yale University Although Gianfilippo Carettoni's excavations of the House of Augustus secured the identification of Octavian's famed Palatine complex over 30 years ago, a comprehensive architec- tural reconstruction of the known complex is still lacking. This poster presents such a reconstruction based upon new evi- dence from my study of the archaeological remains in and ex situ and the results of previously published excavations. Origi- nal photographs, plans, elevations, sections, and axonometric drawings illustrate the conclusions. The study evaluates the structural implications ofashlar con- struction and the proportions of architectural sculpture ex situ to propose an elevation of the house's porticus that departs significantly from the proposal put forth by Patrizio Pensabene in 1998. The employment of Luna marble to articulate the decorative elevation of the porticus, the influence of Asia Mi- nor on the marble architectural sculpture, and the use ofaediculae to distinguish the important rooms on the porticus's north flank indicates that the house played a fundamental role in the archi- tectural revolution of the 30s B.C. The study also presents new evidence to restore the Portico of the Danaids to the precinct of the Temple of Apollo. The house's first floor plan reveals several peculiarities best ex- plained as the result of the need to meet the structural re- quirements of a portico located on the third story, at the level of the temple precinct. The design and proportions of con- temporary precinct porticoes further suggest that the archi- tectural elements assigned by Pensabene to the house should be restored to the portico. THE REASSESSMENT OF A ROMANO-BYZANTINE VILLA ON THE BYRSA HILL IN CARTHAGE: Chris- tine Zitrides, University of Illinois, and Alicia Walker, Harvard University In 1998 an international team initiated excavations on the Byrsa Hill in Carthage with the goal of further exploring the remains of a partially excavated Romano-Byzantine villa lo- cated along the Cardo Maximus, near the summit of the city's acropolis. Pere Delattre, of the Order of the White Fathers, previously excavated the site in 1892 and published the results of his investigation in the 1893 Bulletin Archiologique. He offered a Byzantine date for the building, produced a partial plan of the site, and provided a list of recovered small finds. Although the structure has been exposed for over a century, no documented work has been carried out since Delattre's investigations. The present project aims to reassess Delattre's dating of the building, to elucidate the interrelationship of its multiple phases, to conserve the exposed structure, and to remap the site. In the course of the present three year campaign, a com- plex stratigraphic sequence has emerged, which suggests oc- cupation from the first century B.C.E. to the sixth century C.E. Previously undocumented mosaics indicate at least three separate episodes of construction, and exploration of hereto unexposed areas will allow for the integration of this structure into the urban topography of Carthage. In our poster, we present preliminary results from the 1998- 2001 campaigns, offering new dates and a revised map of the site's multiple phases. The villa provides an intriguing case study of reuse and adaptation in the urban domestic context of Roman and Byzantine Carthage. BIR FTOUHA EXCAVATION 1994-2000: RECON- STRUCTING A HISTORY FROM FRAGMENTS: Susan 7: Stevens, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, and Brian S. Dayhoff University of Maryland In five campaigns of open area excavation (ca. 1,600 m2) the current project has revealed an elaborate basilica complex at least 80 m E-W by 55 m N-S in extent. One of the most striking aspects of the site is that the complex had only one major phase of construction now tentatively dated to the early sixth century. The center of the complex was a three-aisled ambulatory basilica, entered through a polygonal structure in the west. East of the basilica's apse was a round baptistery attached to the basilica by twin peristyle courtyards that pro- vided the complex with a N-S axis. Because Bir Ftouha was systematically dismantled and robbed for building materials, probably beginning in the early Islamic period, colonnades and elevation walls survived primarily as rob- ber trenches. Only patterns of distribution of fragments of decorated red slipped roof tiles, opus sectile wall panels, andbizonal griffin capitals found in destruction debris and later fill remain to articulate the decoration of the complex. Mosaic floors re- mained in situ but those cut by later graves suffered from tomb robbing and the floor surfaces closest to modern ground level were heavily damaged by tree planting and plowing. The poster highlights post-excavation analysis of this im- portant but poorly preserved early Christian basilica complex on the outskirts of Carthage. It previews the final report on the excavation, currently in preparation.

DONKEYS, CARTS, AND CAMELS: THE DECLINE OF THE ROMAN ROADS, THE RISE OF ISLAMIC TRADE: Karen Eva Carr, Portland State University Throughout the early Middle Ages, one major road ran through Baetica-the Via Augusta. Many minor roads con- nected the smaller towns to each other and moved silver from the mines of the Sierra Morena to the riverine ports. As the milestones and the legal codes show, these roads were kept up by corvbe labor under the compulsion of the imperial govern- ment. Archaeological evidence from surface survey (M. Ponsich, Implantation Rurale Antique sur le Bas-Guadalquivir, Madrid, 1974-1991) sheds light on the role of these roads in the fourth century and illuminates their fate after the collapse of Roman rule. Many fourth-century Baetican sites clustered along the Via Augusta, and others lined the smaller roads. But there are almost no fifth-century sites along the Via Augusta. Sites also moved further away from the smaller roads and cluster along the rivers instead. Sixth-century sites under Visigothic rule show a slight return to the Via Augusta, especially downstream of Seville. There is a tendency to align sites with the minor roads as well, but not to the extent of the fourth century. There is no seventh-century survey evidence, but under Is- lamic rule the eighth- and ninth-century sites return to an alignment with the Via Augusta. They are located still further from the minor roads. Apparently the form of government had a significant impact on the road system of Baetica. THE POLISHED STONE AXES FROM KNOSSOS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AEGEAN NEO- LITHIC: Thomas F Strasser, California State Uni- versity, Sacramento Polished stone axes, adzes, and chisels (collectively known as "celts") are signature tools of the Neolithic in Europe and west Asia. They appear in the first phases of habitation at Knossos and are vestiges of the earliest colonizers of Crete. This paper presents the preliminary results of an analysis of those tools. The research focuses on the celts' surface abra- sions, symmetry, and media for evidence concerning produc- tion, function, and resource exploitation. The Knossian assemblage indicates a variety of production techniques. Several tools bear evidence for flaking and drill- ing. Only certain stones have qualities that allow for these reduction processes. There is evidence that specific stones were exploited for predetermined shapes that were depen- dent on the reduction technique to be used. There is also functional variability. Many of the tools are miniatures comprised of soft stone that could not function as woodworking instruments. These tools are shaped to a degree of symmetry beyond requirements, suggesting a nonutilitarian use that is still unclear. Ethnographies report many symbolic complexes surrounding celt use that may be paralleled in the Cretan setting. A few tools are made from imported emery. They may be the earliest evidence for the exploitation of Cycladic or Anatolian emery in the Aegean. If Cycladic, these tools dem- onstrate the visitation of the emery bearing islands (e.g., Naxos) during the Aceramic Neolithic. Consequently, the exploration, mining skills, and trade mechanisms during the Aceramic Neolithic were more sophisticated than previously thought. A NEW LINK BETWEEN THE SHAFT GRAVES OF MYCENAE AND CRETE: SILVER COATINGS FOR BRONZE RIVETS ON AEGEAN DAGGERS: Susan Ferrence, Temple University, and Kristalia Melesanaki, Maripaz P Mateo, and Demetrios Anglos, Foundation for Research and Technology- Hellas (FORTH), Institute of Electronic Struc- ture and Laser, Crete A copper rivet from an LM context in Building AD on Pseira, Crete was analyzed by laser-induced breakdown spec- troscopy (LIBS) at the INSTAP Study Center of East Crete in July 2000 and found to have silver coating on both ends. The rivet was probably used to hold the hilt onto an edged weapon such as a knife, dagger, or sword. The excavators originally thought it was made of only copper or bronze but it had not been scientifically analyzed until this recent series of tests. LIBS has been adapted for elementally analyzing archaeo- logical artifacts in order to gather scientific information about metals, pottery, and other ancient materials. The transport- able workstation provides on-site, rapid results about the quali- tative and semi-quantitative elemental composition of archaeo- logical objects. LIBS is practically nondestructive because less than a microgram of sample material is consumed when the laser pulse ablates the sample surface. The emission from the resulting plasma plume is collected and spectrally analyzed by the system. Each element present in the sample is identified by its characteristic emission line(s) at specific wavelength (s) on the recorded spectrum. This new scientific evidence helps to link the LM town of Pseira to the LM palace of Mallia and the LH Shaft Graves of Mycenae. Mallia and Mycenae had strong metalworking tradi- tions as indicated by gold plate hilt covers and pommel attach- ments from the former and elaborately inlaid daggers from the latter. Now all three sites are linked by the silver-capped rivets used as fine decorative details on edged weapons. WEIGHT MEASUREMENT IN LATE MYCENAEAN GREECE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY: Karl M. Petruso, University of Texas at Arlington As a result of research carried out over the past generation into weight metrology in the prehistoric Aegean, the stan- dard mass as well as the mathematical structure of the system of weight measurement used in Late Bronze Age Crete and the Cycladic Islands are now understood in great detail. A satisfying harmony exists between the evidence from the sur- viving balance weights themselves and the evidence from the Linear B tablets which deal with quantities of goods accounted for by weight. By contrast, however, the standards of weight measurement used in mainland Greece for the entire Mycenaean period are very poorly understood, owing largely to the rarity of identified and published balance weights. Recent metrological analyses of the masses of some four dozen well-preserved balance weights from two sites (Mycenae and the fountain on the north slope of the Athenian Acropo-</page><page sequence="22">252 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 lis) have provided evidence for at least two internally consis- tent-yet apparently different--systems of weight measure- ment in mainland Greece at the end of the LBA. The results of these analyses will be presented, and their ramifications for our understanding ofMycenaean microeconomics and macro- economics will be considered. To DYE FOR: RECONSTRUCTING MUREX DYEING TECHNIQUES IN THE BRONZE AGE AEGEAN: Deborah Ruscillo, University of Winnipeg The manufacture of the "Royal Purple" dye had a signifi- cant impact on the social and economic worlds of the Aegean Bronze Age. Reams of cloth and garments were traded and offered as tribute to courts and shrines. Even the term "Royal Purple" signifies the importance and wealth of the cloth as a status object. The crushing of thousands of marine gastropods of the species murex was required to dye fabric a deep shade of purple. The work was intensive and unpleasant, from the gath- ering of enough specimens, to the dye extraction from each individual, to the concoction of the dye itself. Since the Roman times, other sources of purple have been used to dye cloth, and the techniques and recipes of murex dye have been lost. Ancient authors, such as Pliny, superfi- cially discuss the dyemaking procedure but do not offer de- tails. In the summer of 2001, with generous funding from the Institute of Aegean Prehistory, the author will set out to re- construct murex dye manufacture techniques. The work will be performed in Crete at the site of Kommos, where excava- tions of the MM II/III period have produced industrial re- mains of a murex dyeing installation. Crushed murex has also been found in contemporary levels at Palaikastro and Knossos, also on the island. This paper will present the results of the 2001 murex sea- son, and will illustrate the results of the baiting, extracting, concocting, and dyeing experiments. Swatches of linen, wool, and silk will be presented to show color ranges in comparison with ancient iconographic representations of the Royal Purple. THE IKLAINA ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: 2001 REPORT: Michael B. Cosmopoulos, University of Manitoba The Iklaina Archaeological Project is an interdisciplinary project aiming at investigating A-pu2, one of the district capi- tals of the Mycenaean state of Pylos through survey, excava- tion, and scientific analyses. The third season of the survey was conducted for three weeks in May-June 2001. During this time we covered the eastern end of the plateau, the ravine to the west, and the hills to the southwest and northwest of the location Traghanes, where Marinatos had excavated briefly in 1954. In the central part of the east section of the plateau we discovered a large concentration ofpottery, including EH bowls of the so-called Nozaina ware, a large number of Late Roman sherds with combed decoration, and Byzantine glazed sherds. Another major concentration of pottery was found on a low ridge connecting the modern village of Iklaina with the main plateau, approximately 900 m to the southeast of Traghanes. This concentration consisted of over 2,000 LH IIIA1-B2 sherds (including many stems and rims from good quality kylikes). Finally, a large number of LH IIIA1-B2 sherds and one Mycenaean bovine figurine were found in a previously unex- plored part of the cliff immediately to the southwest of Traghanes. The study of the stone tools from the site revealed three Paleolithic chert blades, one of which is made with the Levallois technique. The geophysical survey conducted at Traghanes revealed the continuation of the large building complex revealed last year, as well as parallel curvilinear fea- tures that could belong to fortification walls. COUNTING SHERDS BY THE THOUSANDS: SYSTEM- ATIC SURVEY OF AN AMPHORA PRODUCTION SITE: Effie E Athanassopoulos, University of Nebraska- Lincoln This research project is a collaboration between the Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens and the 13th Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Archaeological Service. It is a study of land use and economic activities in an area known as "Tsoukalia" on the island of Alonissos in the Aegean, in Greece. Tsoukalia in modern Greek means "pots." In this location there are substantial remains of a fourth-century B.C.E. transport amphora pro- duction site. The site was reused for similar activities in the early 20th century, when a brick and tile factory operated there for a few years. The fourth-century phase is the pri- mary focus of our research. In the 1999 and 2000 field seasons systematic recording of the dense surface scatters of ceramics was carried out. Most of this material has come to the surface in the last few decades from repeated disturbances of the extensive pottery dumps. Clearly, the dumps are a product of the operation of the amphora production facility. On the basis of the informa- tion we have collected it is now possible to create density plots of surface ceramic artifacts across the site. We have also documented the pottery forms present at the site along with a statistical breakdown of their relative frequency. This poster presentation will report on the results of the systematic sur- vey of the last two seasons. THE MALLAKASTRA REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT (MRAP): RESULTS OF THE 2001 SUR- VEY AND EXCAVATION SEASON NEAR APOLLONIA, ALBANIA: Sharon R. StockerandJack L. Davis, Uni- versity of Cincinnati, Muzafer Korkuti and Skender Mugaj, Institute of Archaeology, Tirana, Lorenc Bejko, International Centre for Albanian Ar- chaeology, Tirana, and Michael L. Galaty, Millsaps College The Mallakastra RegionalArchaeological Project (MRAP) is a cooperative program of regional archaeological research, sponsored by the Institute of Archaeology (Tirana, Albania) and the Department of Classics of the University of Cincin- nati. The goal of MRAP is to study patterns of settlement and land use in the area of Fier, regional capital of the district of Mallakastra, Albania. Three seasons of intensive surface survey in 1998, 1999, and 2000 have resulted in the investigation of ca. 22 km2 around the ancient Greek city of Apollonia, a Corinthian colony established in the sixth century B.C., and later a western terminus for the Via Egnatia. InJune andJuly of 2001 we planned test excavations at a small Hellenistic site that was discovered, mapped, and surface collected in 2001. These excavations should help to determine the function of the site (such sites, when found in Greece, are often inter- preted as farmsteads). Excavations may also help to explain</page><page sequence="23">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 253 the apparent increase in settlement outside of Apollonia's walls during the Hellenistic period, a pattern that differs strongly when compared to the region's Classical and Roman settlement patterns. In addition, during the 2001 field season MRAP will expand its program of ancient environmental reconstruction based on palynological investigations and soil studies, extract addi- tional sediment cores for pollen analysis, and complete the mapping of the massive necropolis (several square kilometers in area) associated with Apollonia. EXCAVATIONS AT KONJUH, REPUBLIC OF MACE- DONIA, 2000-2001: Carolyn S. Snively, Gettysburg College Ajoint project of Gettysburg College and the Museum of Macedonia carried out excavations in 2000 and (we hope) 2001 at the site of Golemo Gradiste, Konjuh, Kratovo. Inves- tigations have focused on the acropolis of the city; the long bedrock outcropping rises ca. 100 m above the Kriva River at its foot. The eastern third of the acropolis consists of a long, gen- tly sloping plateau. Its northern side shows extensive re- mains of rock-cut architecture, e.g., rooms, corridors, and staircases leading down to a narrow terrace beyond which the terrain falls precipitously toward the lower northern section of the city. A terrace-fortification wall marks the southern edge of the plateau. Excavation toward the western end of the plateau revealed two rooms of a large building. The apsidal western room mea- sured 3.6 x 9.4 m, the eastern one 4 x 9 m. The function of the building, which extends to east and south, remains un- certain; fragments of stone mouldings point to a degree of provincial elegance. Trenches further east, across the width of the plateau, lead us to suspect that the residents of the area created the plateau in late antiquity. They apparently leveled the cliffs at the north side and then shaped the remains into rooms; east-west terrace walls were constructed to retain earth and to form the plateau as well as to serve as foundations for numerous buildings. The reasons for intensive occupation of this inhospitable hill, perhaps administrative or military, await further investigation. INSCRIPTIONS ON ATTIC POTTERY: ONESIMOS'S ILIUPERSIS IN THE VILLA GIULIA: Pierre Desrochers, Universite d'Ottawa, and Martin E Kilmer, Uni- versity of Ottawa The Getty's Iliupersis kylix by Onesimos has had excellent publication for its mythology and its links to other works of Onesimos, those in the Getty and some of those elsewhere. The inscriptions on this kylix, however, have not been stud- ied as a body. The readings cause few problems: they are the names of the participants in the battle, from both Akhaian and Trojan sides, and a small set of "other" inscriptions, such as the identification of the altar at which Priam is about to be killed: HERKAIOU ("Of [Zeus] Herkaios"). The alphabet Onesimos uses is the standard Attic 19-let- ter Archaic alphabet (with one very interesting modifica- tion). His spellings of most of the names are right in line with those used by painters earlier in the period. One name offers what seems to be the earliest known example (cer- tainly the earliest I know of on pottery) of what was later to become a standard Attic usage-and one which was out of step with the rest of the Greek-speaking world. This raises interesting questions about Onesimos's origins and about the origins of some peculiarities of written Attic Greek. This work is part of the continuing saga of the Image Project, a Web-based searchable database of inscriptions on Attic Archaic pottery. THE AMPHORAE "WITH WINEGLASS-SHAPED FEET" OF "PORTICELLO" AND "MELITOPOL" TYPES: MENDE OR Kos?: Nevena Georgieva, University of London, U.K. The paper questions the widely accepted Mendean attribu- tion of the amphorae "with wineglass-shaped feet" of "Porticello" type of the first half of the fourth century B.C. found predominantly in the area of the Black Sea. Based on the publication ofworkshops producing amphorae of this type on Kos (type III) (Kantzia 1994); unpublished stamped mate- rials from the collection of the British Museum; and detailed study of shapes, texture and markings, it achieves the follow- ing: 1. supports a date of ca. 425 B.C. for the Porticello ship wreck (Eiseman and Ridgway 1987) (based also on a more precise dating of the amphorae of "Soloha II" type); 2. supports Koan origin for the amphorae of type 1 (i.e., "with wineglass-shaped feet") from the wreck; 3. suggests that in the fourth century B.C. such amphorae were produced by both Kos and Mende and that Mendean shapes copied, or were influenced by, the Koan type III amphorae of the late fifth century B.C.; 4. suggests a transitional shape for the Mendean class from the rounded shapes of the fifth to the angular shapes of the fourth century B.C.; 5. offers certain Koan identifications among the published materials of the first half of the fourth century B.C.; and 6. proposes Koan identification of the "Melitopol" type of amphorae "with wineglass-shaped feet" (Zeest 1960, 89) of the second half of the fourth century B.C. from the eponymous tumulus and the Chertomlyk tumulus in south Russia (Polin 1991), connecting them directly to one of the Koan work shops. POTTERY AT HACiMUSALAR IN NORTH CENTRAL LYCIA: Mark B. Garrison and James Gallagher, Trin- ity University, Ilknur Ozgen, Bilkent University, Turkey, and Halford Haskell and Pamela Haskell, Southwestern University The site of Hacimusalar is a large hoyuik located in the Elmall basin in north central Lycia. Excavations over the last sixyears have yielded important evidence for pottery typologies and chronologies for the area. This poster session will focus on two importantaspects of the pottery assemblage atHaclmusalar. The first concerns the nature of the rich local Roman pottery assemblage and its relationships to Roman pottery in greater western Anatolia. The second concerns the stratified sequence that the site has revealed for pottery of the Iron Age and Classical periods. The pottery for these first millennium B.C. periods in Lycia as a whole is poorly documented and little studied. The material from Haclmusalar will contribute sig- nificantly to a better understanding of pottery in these peri-</page><page sequence="24">254 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ods. Excavations in two separate areas of the h6yifk have yielded well-stratified deposits of pottery from these periods, includ- ing some exceptionally nice examples of phiale. This poster session will exhibit via photography and draw- ing the major wares for the periods under discussion and their relationships to known pottery assemblages at other sites. The poster will also include information about the nature of the archaeological deposits in which the pottery was found. PROVENANCE OF ETRUSCAN POTTERY FROM POGGIO COLLA, ITALY: A CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION STUDY:JustinJ. Winkler and Robert H. Tykot, Uni- versity of South Florida The field report is a combined contextual and archaeometric study of Etruscan pottery based upon research being con- ducted at the site of Poggio Colla. The site is a recently discov- ered hilltop settlement (ca. 700-100 B.C.) now undergoing excavation by Southern Methodist University. Settlement contexts are rare hence the site provides a special opportunity to reconstruct manufacturing technology, material provenance, and distribution. Etruscan pottery manufacture is poorly known in the Mugello region of Etruria. The current study hypothesizes that the site's production strategies are centralized, thereby indicative of an intraregional redistributive economy, perhaps suggesting the presence of a centralized political authority. Alternative results may conclude, however, that Poggio Colla is a provincial settlement with site-specific pottery manufacture moderately sustained at the household level. Current evidence at Poggio Colla indicates continuous internal development for at least 600 years prior to Romanization, however, whether this phenomena occurred independent of major centers to the south still has yet to be determined. Investigations comprise three components: (1) the excava- tion of a pottery production zone containing one or more kilns; (2) the location and sampling of potential clay sources in and around the site area; and (3) the systematic physical and chemical characterization of ceramic material utilizing petrography and ICP mass spectrometry to clearly identify fea- tures of local production and to determine other sources of production. Investigations are to focus upon analyzing ceramic samples representing each known fabric type including utili- tarian (coarse and fine) and special function (black glaze and bucchero) wares from three periods of occupation. GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND CHARACTER- IZATION OF THE CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN OB- SIDIAN SOURCES: NEW APPROACHES TO AN OLD PROBLEM: Robert H. Tykot, Lisa Beyer, Teddi Setzer, Barbara Vargo, John Bernal, and Julie Bliss, Uni- versity of South Florida Studies of prehistoric trade in obsidian have been a major aspect of archaeological research for more than a quarter cen- tury, yet until recently the central Mediterranean sources were not all fully documented. Furthermore, the source analysis of obsidian artifacts mostly has been limited to small numbers of samples, limiting the determination of regional and chronological patterns of obsidian use. Our NSF-funded geoarchaeological survey of obsidian sources on Lipari, Palmarola, and Pantelleria employed a systematic approach to the location and documentation of the multiple localities where obsidian may be found on each of these islands, and complements previous work done on the Monte Arci sources in Sardinia by Tykot (JAS24 [1997] 467-79). We also present results from the characterization of each source, based on visual and physical properties as well as trace element finger- printing using neutron activation analysis and laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry. The application of these methods to well over 1,000 obsid- ian artifacts is allowing us to construct statistically significant geographic and chronological patterns of obsidian source ex- ploitation. New interpretive schemes reestablish exchange as critically important for understanding all stages of the chaine op~atoire of lithic raw material acquisition, modification, use, and discard. As the most visible indicator of Neolithic interac- tions in the central Mediterranean, obsidian use is also rel- evant to discussions of the earliest settlement of the Mediter- ranean islands, the transition to agriculture, long-distance exchange networks, craft specialization, and the development of social differentiation and other precursors of more complex Copper and Bronze Age societies. DIET AND MOBILITY IN MEDIEVAL GREECE AS RE- CONSTRUCTED USING STABLE ISOTOPE ANALY- sis: Sandra Garvie-Lok, University of Calgary Historical documents allow the reconstruction of aspects of the Medieval Greek diet, including the types of foods eaten and their symbolic roles. However, a number of important questions remain. These include the exact importance of marine resources to the diet, whether this importance varied by locale, and whether the ethnic differences in foodways noted by many chroniclers translated to significant differences in day-to-day diet. This study addresses such questions using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of archaeological human bone from several Medieval Greek communities. I ex- amine Christian communities of the Late Byzantine through Turkokratia from inland, coastal, and island locales, and com- pare bone from Frankish and Ottoman Muslim cemeteries to this grouped sample. The results of the analyses suggest that marine resources typically played a small role in the Medieval diet, belying the importance of fish as a status item. Contrary to expectations, there appears to be little difference in diet by locale or ethnic affiliation. Most interesting, perhaps, is the significant increase in internal variability seen in some Otto- man era communities. This most likely reflects increased life- time mobility in these groups, and agrees with historical evi- dence for increased trade and movement in the Ottoman era. My results illustrate the potential of stable isotope analysis of human remains not only for the reconstruction of diet in the past but also for the study of shifting patterns of residential mobility over time. LATE BRONZE AGE VEGETATION CHANGE, CLI- MATIC DETERIORATION, AND HUMAN RESPONSE IN THE STRATH OF KILDONAN, SUTHERLAND, SCOTLAND: Darcey L. Francis, University of Edinburgh, Scotland A severe and abrupt climatic deterioration in the Late Bronze Age has been cited as the source of social, cultural, and economic disintegration in northwest Europe. In Britain, it is</page><page sequence="25">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 255 believed that this deterioration resulted in the abandon- ment of environmentally marginal communities. Subsequent intergroup conflict led to the collapse of the established social order and the emergence of new structures and sys- tems. This view is criticized as overly environmentally de- terministic and extreme because the reality, uniqueness, extent, and predictability of this settlement collapse has yet to be established. The Strath of Kildonan, Sutherland in northern Scotland is used as a study site where climate- human relations can be effectively assessed because it is historically and currently economically marginal, climati- cally stressed, possesses a rich and well-understood archaeo- logical landscape, and previous work has supported the aban- donment hypothesis. Simplified models suggest that settlement viability was governed by altitude, and the abandonment of upland settlements occurred preferentially, with migration to core areas in the lowlands and the valley floor. Three deep peat basins were sampled for analysis at locations implied by the archaeological record to be either at core or the periph- eral settings, allowing continuous measurement of vegeta- tion changes associated with prehistoric settlement ex- pansion and contraction. A range of paleoenvironmental tools (pollen analysis and peat stratigraphy) including tephrochronology, radiocarbon dating, and GIS is used to test models of prehistoric settlement in Scotland, in particu- lar that economic thresholds were lowered and settlements were abandoned in the LBA. MAPPING THE LANDSCAPE OF PREHISTORIC OHIO: GIS ANALYSIS OF SETTLEMENT AND RESOURCE EXPLOITATION IN KNOX COUNTY: P. Nick Kardulias and Aaron Fuleki, College of Wooster Knox County in central Ohio contains an abundant but understudied archaeological record. The region lies between two key areas. To the south along the Scioto River and other major drainages, the Adena and Hopewell cultures constructed numerous impressive earthworks. Many sites in the northern part of the state also exhibit such elaborate features in sev- eral periods. Cyrus Thomas and William Mills, pioneers of American archaeology, did conduct work in the county in the late 19th century. The Kokosing River Basin Archaeo- logical Survey (KRBS) began work in the 1970s with a com- bined strategy of regional survey and excavation in order to gather data about prehistoric land use, settlement patterns, exchange systems, and technology in eastern Knox County. From 1991 to 1998, excavation focused on two multicompo- nent loci, the Acton Site (33KN345), a Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric (ca. 5000 B.C.-A.D. 1200) lithic workshop, and the Millwood Rockshelter (33KN395) with EarlyArchaic to Late Woodland deposits (7000 B.C.-A.D. 1000). To place these sites in their regional context, we undertook GIS analy- sis of the potential catchment area within a 10 km radius around the two loci. We incorporated physiographic features (soil type, elevation, aspect, proximity to primary and sec- ondary water sources, and distance from major chert quar- ries) in the database. The analysis suggests a consistent settle- ment pattern throughout the entire prehistoric sequence. It seems that the shift from Archaic foraging to Woodland hor- ticulture did not have a major impact on residential mobility, similar to what some scholars have suggested for other parts of Ohio. THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED IS GETTING MORE TRAF- FIC: ARCHAEOLOGICAL TOURISM IN MEXICO'S YUCATAN PENINSULA: Cameronf. Walker, Califor- nia State University at Fullerton Archaeological tourism is increasingly popular in the Yucatan Peninsula. As millions of people arrive in Cancun each year, many of them move down the coast to visit lesser-known ar- chaeological sites. This paper explores some of the issues con- cerning archaeological tourism as they are being encountered at four Maya archaeological sites in the state of Quintana Roo. Each site offers different challenges and requires different solutions. One site, El Altar, is located on the grounds of a public botanical garden already open for tourism. T'isil is lo- cated on privately owned Rancho Santa Maria whose owner plans to offer small-scale luxury vacations. The other two ar- chaeological sites, Muyil and Naranjal, are adjacent to small Maya communities that view tourism development as an op- portunity to improve their standard of living. Certain material improvements must be made at each archaeological site to make it an accessible, meaningful experience for the tourists who visit. Each site must be monitored since the environ- ment, local communities, and archaeological monuments are all interconnected in a complex web where negative impacts on one cannot be completely separated from impacts on the others. There is some urgency to identify potential problems and find solutions since these sites are already targeted for tourism development and plans are proceeding. If these sites can be designed as low-impact, sustainable tourism destina- tions, they will serve as models to encourage conservation practices in the Yucatan as well as in other parts of the world. ARCHAEOLOGY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: IS- SUES AND OPPORTUNITIES: Arlene K. Fleming, World Bank In developing countries, proliferating construction dimin- ishes the record of mankind's cultural heritage by damaging or destroying excavated and hidden archaeological material, historic structures, sites of living culture, and natural features with cultural significance. During the past four decades, there have been attempts to encourage due attention to cultural resources when undertak- ing projects such as dams, roads, irrigation systems, and urban upgrading or expansion. UNESCO issued a Recommendation Concerning the Preservation of Cultural Property Endangered by Public orPrivate Worksin 1968, calling upon member countries to take protective measures. The World Bank, in 1986, added a policy note directing planners of development projects to safeguard cultural property. Environmental assessments, re- quired by multilateral lending institutions and bilateral donor agencies, include procedures for identification and protec- tion of cultural heritage. However, without strong advocacy, enforcement, operational guidance, adequate information, and skilled practitioners, these policies have limited effect. Recognizing the problem, the World Bank is strengthen- ing its policy for safeguarding cultural resources in develop- ment projects by mandating the integration of this work into the environmental impact assessment process. Cultural heri- tage considerations will become an essential part of project planning, design, and implementation in Bank-financed projects. This will necessitate accelerated surveying, mapping, and information management. It could lead to a new perspec-</page><page sequence="26">256 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 tive on the management of cultural resources, a holistic, inter- disciplinary approach, requiring analytical instruments, impact assessment methods, and training in a broad range of skills. SESSION 2A: WATER SUPPLY AND USAGE THE ROMAN AQUEDUCT BRIDGE AT KEMERDERE NEAR ILION (TROY): William Aylward, Univer- sity of Wisconsin-Madison Recent investigation of the aqueduct bridge at Kemerdere in northwestern Turkey has clarified the sig- nificance of the bridge for Ilion's water supply during the Roman empire. From a source in the Ida Mountains the aqueduct crossed the gorge of the Thymbrios River (Kemer Su) on a masonry bridge about 12 km east of Ilion. The discovery of part of the aqueduct's underground conduit between the bridge and Ilion in 1998 confirmed the bridge's connection to the city. The preserved height of the bridge above the gorge (ca. 27 m) and the span of the principal arch (ca. 16 m) rank the bridge among the largest and most ambitious of its kind. This paper presents the first system- atic analysis of the bridge's construction and date, as well as its architectural and functional relationship to Ilion's hy- draulic system and known public buildings, which include a monumental nymphaeum and bath. The keystone of the principal arch had a relief bust, which has now weathered beyond recognition. J.M. Cook (The Troad [Oxford 1973] 116), following earlier commen- tators, called the bust a portrait of aJulio-Claudian emperor. However, inscriptions normally commemorated patronage of aqueducts and bridges, and the extant comparanda for decorated keystones in the East tend to be mythological. A bust of Apollo would have marked the bridge's presumed location near the lost sanctuary ofApollo Thymbraios, which was tied to the legendary fall of Troy as the setting for Apollo's gift of prophecy to Cassandra and Achilles' abduc- tion and murder of Troilus. IN TIMES OF STRIFE AND TIMES OF GROWTH: WA- TERING LATE ROMAN ATHENS: Shawna Leigh, In- tercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome The "modern" history of the study of the water supply of Roman Athens began in C.E. 1436, when Cyriacus of Ancona recorded the dedicatory inscription of an aqueduct built for the city by the emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius (CIL 549). Knowledge of this particular aqueduct has dominated subsequent discussions of the hydraulics in Roman Athens, resulting in a tendency to ascribe any piece of Roman water supply structure to the second-century C.E. system. While no period of the Roman hydraulic system in Athens has hereto- fore been well-studied, almost no attention has been given to this aspect of the urban infrastructure dating after the Herulian sack of C.E. 267. In this paper I present the combined evi- dence from the Athenian Agora, yearly reports of excavations throughout the city, and particularly the results of the recent excavations associated with the Athens Metro project. The data present a picture of a city able to utilize a combination of contemporary Roman hydraulic methods with local know-how in order to meet its water supply needs, both in times of strife and in times of growth, between the Herulian sack and the reign ofJustinian. THE WATER SUPPLY OF ROMAN CARTHAGE: Ex- CAVATIONS AT THE LA MALGA CISTERNS (1999-2001): Hans vanderLeest, Mount Allison University Set on the northern edge of Roman Carthage, the La Malga cisterns are among the largest reservoir cisterns known from the Roman world, with an estimated capacity of at least 51,000 min. The area adjacent to these cisterns contains other hydraulic installations, including a branch of the Zaghouan aqueduct, and it is possible that the area of La Malga func- tioned as a major distribution point for the water supply of Roman Carthage. Although extensive remains of the cis- terns were always known, there has been little archaeologi- cal investigation of the area. Recent clearing of debris by the Mus&amp;e National de Carthage has made the site more acces- sible for archaeological excavation. Campaigns undertaken by Mount Allison University in 1999-2001 have concentrated on establishing the limits of the cisterns and on recovering evidence for the date of con- struction. The main block of the cisterns, made up of the 15 parallel barrel-vaulted chambers now visible, was enclosed by a retaining wall. Investigation of this wall has confirmed that the complex never extended beyond it. The transverse cis- tern on the southeast side of the main block was clearly added later, although before the construction of the Zaghouan aqueduct in the second century A.D. When the aqueduct was built, the ground level at the east corner was raised significantly. A short preserved length of a smaller channel at this corner, once thought to be an inlet to supply the main cisterns, is in fact connected to a separate hydraulic installation constructed east of the cistern complex. THE PETRA GARDEN FEASIBILITY STUDY: Leigh-Ann Bedal, American Center for Oriental Research As a result of the identification of a pool-complex with a monumental swimming pool and island-pavilion and an elabo- rate hydraulic system during a 1998 survey and excavation of the so-called Lower Market at Petra, it was hypothesized that the large earthen terrace (65 x 53 m) adjoining the pool was the site of an ancient garden of the Nabataean-Roman period. In the summer of 2001, a feasibility study was conducted that was specifically devoted to the preliminary investigation of the garden terrace. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provided a view of the terrace's subsurface, revealing the layout of archi- tectural features along the central axis as well as variations in soil stratigraphy. Based on the GPR findings, excavation trenches were opened to test the results of GPR, to determine the stratigraphic sequence of the garden terrace, and to iden- tify and describe the soils and any architectural and hydraulic features that belong to the Nabataean-Roman garden phase of the site. Coinciding with the excavations, a number of soil cores were taken in order to determine the site's stratigraphy and soil morphology. This paper presents the methodology and findings of the feasibility study and its implications for further study of the Petra pool-complex and garden.</page><page sequence="27">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 257 TOILETS OF HADRIAN'S VILLA AT TIVOLI (ITALY) AND ROMAN PRIVACY: Gemma C.M.Jansen, Uni- versity of Nijmegen, The Netherlands Confronted with the large number of Roman communal toilets and communal baths, many people conclude that the present notion of privacy was not available in these times. This rather general conclusion can be put into perspective by study- ing the level of privacy in the toilets of the emperor Hadrian's villa at Tivoli. Here we investigated more than 30 toilets with two questions in mind: (1) Which people used which toilets? (2) How much privacy did these toilets offer? It appeared that there were different levels of privacy for different groups visiting or living at the villa. The soberly fur- nished multiseater toilets for staff members did not provide much privacy and users had no possibility to separate themselves physically from others. However, privacy from passersbywas guar- anteed. The richly decorated single-seat toilets of the emperor and his guests, on the other hand, offered more privacy. The most striking discovery concerned the single-seat toi- lets for guests. Ancient literature reveals that even high offi- cials used multiseaters. The multiseaters detected at several baths of the villa confirm this. But the occurrence of single- seaters especially for guests indicates that Romans, when they had enough money and enough space, preferred single toi- lets and a certain level of privacy. SESSION 2B: SOCIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF ANCIENT ICONOGRAPHY GENDER AND PATRONAGE IN ETRUSCAN ART: THE EVIDENCE OF THE ONOMASTIC MIRRORS: Alexandra A. Carpino, Northern Arizona University The Etruscans' onomastic mirrors-artifacts containing in- scriptions identifying the individuals who either owned, dedi- cated, or received the mirror as a gift-allow scholars inter- ested in questions of patronage and gender an important op- portunity to study these issues in the context of an art form consistently associated with women. In this paper, these mir- rors form the basis of my analysis of the interpretive models that have been used in the past to categorize the subjects and patrons of this important Etruscan art form. The mirrors' epi- graphic evidence indicates that a new interpretative frame- work is essential, one that not only allows for broader and more diverse perspectives on issues such as gender and owner- ship but also one that moves beyond stereotypes based on contemporary cultural values and ideas. In addition, the ono- mastic mirrors demonstrate the problematic nature of trying to distinguish ownership on the basis of iconography alone. Since they contain both female and male names, their sub- jects allow one to understand both the types and range of scenes patronized by the Etruscans as well as whether Etruscan artists created iconographies geared specifically, or even ex- clusively, for their female and male clients. Given that men claim ownership of mirrors with subjects as diverse as warrior scenes and love affairs, and that women owned artifacts illus- trating both mythological births and heroic battles, I argue that a new interpretative model is in order, one that considers the multivalent factors-such as gender, function, and con- text-that impact a client's choice of subject matter. WORK AND FREEDMEN IDENTITY IN THE FIRST CEN- TURY A.C.: Michele George, McMaster University In this paper I examine work scenes in early Imperial funerary commemorations to show how negotium, a concept reviled by Roman elites in the late Republic, became widely accepted in self-representation among nonelites and in par- ticular among freedmen. Previous scholarship on this imag- ery (G. Zimmer, Romische Berufdarstellungen [Berlin 1982]) has focused on the identification of attributes and stylistic periodization. More attention to the social context is re- quired, especially to the role of slave experience in the evo- lution of freedmen identity. Initially subordinated to mar- ginal decoration on portrait stelae in the Augustan period, work scenes rapidly assumed a dominant role in the emer- gent collective identity of freedmen and became a legiti- mate visual metaphor for status throughout the Roman em- pire for nonelite groups of varied status. Two exceptional scenes from Rome (now in Florence) dated to the Claudian period depicting the display of cloth use the wares, the set- ting, and the clients to signal the genteel nature of the business transaction to bring prestige to the cloth merchant. The visual imagery can be directly related to the real social circumstances of Roman freedmen, whose own success often depended upon the good will of a rich and influential pa- tron. Other reliefs, simpler in composition and utilizing a system of syncopated visual references to work, evince greater independence from social connections and use work more directly as an assertion of social identity and agency. Using these contrasting examples, I explore the varying modula- tions in the earliest monuments which use work as a com- memorative device. COSTUME AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN PALMYRA: Maura Keane Heyn, University of California, Los Angeles In this paper, I examine the costumes depicted in the funerary portraiture from Palmyra, a caravan city in the Syr- ian desert. Following scholars who analyze the appropriation of Roman material culture in the western provinces of the empire, I argue that the adoption or rejection of Roman styles of dress is related to the struggle for social status in the aftermath of the Roman conquest. Several hundred relief busts, as well as many banquet re- liefs, have been excavated from tombs that were in use in the first three centuries A.D. The relief busts were used to seal the loculi in the tombs, while the banquet reliefs usually adorned the lids of the sarcophagi. Most of the males on the relief busts are depicted in the stance and costume of the Romans. Contrary to the busts, the majority of men who are shown reclining in the banauet reliefs are wearing local dress. In the past, scholars have postulated that this choice of the local costume reflected a desire to be portrayed in fancier dress. I argue, however, that this selection is related to the social relations in the city. Those men featured on the sar- cophagi are clearly important members of society, and their decision not to use the western style of costume is signifi- cant. An analysis of the men who chose to be depicted in local costume as well as a consideration of their activities in the city allows for a more sophisticated understanding of their decision.</page><page sequence="28">258 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 EPHEBIC IMAGERY ON THE GRAVESTONES OF Ro- MAN ATTICA: Celina Gray, University of Califor- nia, Berkeley The representations of nude youths clad only in a chlamys stand in marked contrast to the heavily clothed figures which predominate on the gravestones of Roman Attica. While schol- ars, most recently von Moock (1998), have often labeled the nude youth in funerary art as an ephebe-the 18 year-old male enrolled in the ephebate for military and educational train- ing-there has been little attempt to examine the implica- tions of such imagery on the gravestones of this period. By framing the memory of the deceased in the visual terms of the ephebe, citizens and noncitizens alike could lay claim to a wider Athenian identity regardless of the actual participa- tion of the commemorated individual in the ephebate. Since by the late second century B.C. noncitizens were allowed to become ephebes, the opportunity to announce publicly their connection to this institution may have exercised particular appeal to foreign residents, as gravestones of Milesian immi- grants indicate. Epigrams from the Palatine Anthology and other literary sources attest to the association between the nude male wear- ing the chlamys and the ephebe, while a gravestone from Marathon explicitly uses the inscribed word ephebos in con- junction with a chlamys-clad youth. Likewise, as late as the second century A.C., a group of Athenian reliefs in honor of kosmetai features ephebes that closely resemble the figures on the gravestones. Thus the image of the ephebe remained a potent symbol for Roman Athens in an environment of lively dialogue about what it meant to be an Athenian. PANNONIAN STELAE, ROMANS, AND ROMANIZATION ON THE NORTHERN FRONTIER: Mary 7T Boatwright, Duke University Intercisa, Aquincum, Gorsium, and other sites of Roman Pannonia now furnish some 200 funerary stelae that com- bine relief and text in their representation of the deceased. The stelae date roughly from the middle of the first cen- tury C.E. into the fourth. Many are quite large (originally &gt;2 m H, 0.8 m W), permitting elaborate relief. The more ornate stelae are decorated in zones: the top, often treated architecturally (e.g., as a pediment), surmounts a portrait relief area with the deceased in bust form and on a single level if multiple; an intermediate zone, frequently with a stock scene (such as a horse-drawn coach or a funeral offer- ing), separates the portraits from the accompanying Latin epitaph. Regardless of origin, men are togate or in military dress. Many of the women, however, are in indigenous "Norico-Pannonian" costume, even when shown alongside togate husbands and/or identified epigraphically as Roman citizens. These stelae have never been investigated comprehen- sively in the context of self-identity along the Roman fron- tier. Sailer and Shaw used the texts alone in their general affirmation of the overwhelming importance of the Roman "nuclear" family (JRS 1984; contended by Roxan [1991], again without visuals). O. Harl (1993) compiled examples of women with indigenous dress and names to argue for enduring Celtic matriarchal tendencies. Seen as a whole, however, the stelae evince a more nuanced, inclusive self- identification along this oft-overrun border. SESSION 2C: BRONZE AGE AEGEAN ARCHI- TECTURE AGHIA PHOTIA, SITEIA: TOWARD THE FINAL PUB- LICATION OF A UNIQUE SITE: Metaxia Tsipopoulou, Greek Ministry of Culture Sixteen years ago a 600 m2 rectangular Late Prepalatial building, surrounded by a fortification wall, was excavated at Aghia Photia, east Crete. Sophisticated features, unknown in Minoan architecture, especially at an early stage, combined with absence of prestige artifacts resulted to a significant de- gree of uncertainty concerning its interpretation. Conse- quently, evidence published only in preliminary form was se- lectively used to support often contradictory hypotheses. A final season in 1997 added interesting new elements and es- tablished that the site had a more complex history than ini- tially thought. Limited, yet important, EM remains led us to reconsider the possible connection with the well-known cem- etery 200 m to the east, as well as the fortification wall, which has Early Helladic and Early Cycladic parallels. Although no convincing prototypes are available for the MM I building, its relationship with the rest of Crete and the surrounding area are of much interest. Moreover, special organization and cir- culation patterns reflect absence of hierarchical rules in func- tion. Two MM IIA circular structures, constructed partially on the remains of the MM IA building are identifiable as tholos tombs, also unknown in eastern Crete. Aghia Photia, failing to conform to any convenient interpretation, can serve as an example for the lack of the appropriate tools, both theoretical and methodological, towards an understanding of prehistoric Crete after a century of Minoan archaeology. RECONSTRUCTING THE MISSING FACADE OF THE CENTRAL COURT IN THE PALACE AT KNOSSOS: Joseph W Shaw, University of Toronto When Evans excavated the Palace at Knossos he found the eastern part of the central court eroded down to at least two meters below its original floor level. He also discovered that just east of the court was a huge terrace-like cutting within which were preserved the Grand Staircase and the Residential Quarter. Since then it has been assumed, somewhat vaguely, that the western walls of these two areas formed the edge of the court. This presentation offers a different solution, partially based on comparative analysis with the courts of the other Minoan palaces. Specifically, the proposal is made that fronting the court here was a long pillared portico of two adjoining sec- tions. The first, northern, section of reconstruction is based on Doll and Evans's restoration of an East Hall. South of the Hall was the Grand Staircase, presumably with an entrance leading down to it from the Central Court. Such an entrance can be convincingly established by the fact that all major areas bordering Minoan central courts could be reached directly from them. Yet, the entrance must have been covered (hence the beginning of the second stretch of the proposed portico), for otherwise the Grand Staircase would have been flooded by runoffwater during the rains. The portico continued south, to the end of the court. The proposed restoration finds support from parallels of similar arrangements alongside other palatial courts (e.g.,</page><page sequence="29">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 259 Phaistos, Malia, Kato Zakros, Galatas), some discovered after Evans's time. Moreover, the newly proposed arrangement re- sults in general proportions of court length to width that con- form better with those of the other palaces. The odd propor- tions of the court as now seen were first brought to my atten- tion by one of my graduate students (Arron Lowe), a remark that prompted me to undertake this investigation. A PROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE SOUTH HOUSE AT KNOSSOS: Jane F Lloyd, William Paterson University of New Jersey Reconstructions of the South House at Knossos and other early Neopalatial Minoan houses as block-shaped multistory structures are based on contemporary Aegean images and models. This paper reexamines the evidence for upper stories. Upper stories preserved in the West House and Xeste 3 on Thera and evidence for upper stories in houses on Crete indi- cate that the plans of any upper stories in Theran and Minoan houses are directly related to the ground floor plans of the houses. Mid-second millennium B.C. Aegean and Egyptian images and models of buildings give little information about the existence, form, and extent of upper stories but do sug- gest that roofs could be used as terraces. The minimum thick- ness of bearing walls carrying an upper story is estimated from modern building codes. The bearing walls of Theran houses with upper stories and Minoan houses with evidence for upper stories tend to be thicker than this estimated minimum. Mul- tistory Theran houses are freestanding. Minoan houses with possible upper stories were supported against one side of a cutting or terraces stepped into a slope. Stairways and fallen objects and building debris are not necessarily reliable indica- tors of an upper story. A reconstruction of the South House with a partial upper story of one or two rooms is presented based on this evidence. THE REOPENING OF PETSAS HOUSE: THE STUDY OF A CERAMIC WAREHOUSE AND THE NEW Ex- CAVATION AT MYCENAE: Kim S. Shelton, Greek Archaeological Society This report presents the findings of the initial season of the Greek Archaeological Society's new excavation at Mycenae under the general direction of Dr. Spyros lakovidis in the area known as "Petsas House." It also includes details of the mate- rial under study for publication from the partial investigation by Papadimitriou and Petsas in 1950 and 1951 (Prakt [1950] 203-33; [1951] 192-6, pl. III) that led to the new project. The building complex, as first cleared, consists of two parallel rows of basement rooms situated along a terraced slope. Most of these basement areas were used as storerooms for new (un- used) pottery vessels, which were found broken on the floors having fallen from shelves where theywere originally arranged by shape and size. More than 500 vases and 150 figurines have been identified so far, dating the building's final use and destruction by fire to the LH IIIA2 period (later 14th century B.C.). The first season of the new excavation revealed much more of the building's plan, including an extensive entrance and several ground floor rooms, while the material recovered adds to our knowledge of the settlement and its relationship to the citadel. These finds lead us to a complete reevaluation of some of the past interpretations, although the initial results confirm many of the earlier findings, most significantly of which is the importance of the architectural and ceramic evi- dence dating to LH IIIA2, a period to which few "physical" remains can be assigned, especially at Mycenae. BUILDING STATUS IN THE WEST HOUSE GROUP AT MYCENAE: Bryan E. Burns, University of South- ern California The West House group of Late Helladic structures at Mycenae is traditionally understood as four separate houses, collectively labeled the "Ivory Houses." The buildings' loca- tion outside the citadel, complex architectural form, and un- usuallyvaried contents-ranging from cooking pots and trans- port vessels to luxury imports and Linear B tablets-indicate their multifunctional and elite character. It remains unclear, and much debated, to what degree the palatial authority con- trolled these buildings, as well as the people and activities they housed. In this paper, I concentrate on the architecture of the buildings with an argument that the physical structures were part of the occupants' attempt to enhance their stand- ing in a palatial context. Previous scholarly attention to the architecture has resulted in numerous schemes for the details of entrance and circula- tion. My examination is of a more comprehensive nature, beginning with the preserved remains, rather than the simpli- fied restorations offered by the excavators, and presenting a new interpretation of building history and spatial dynamics. Apprehending the construction sequence as a series of ex- pansions of a single complex, rather than the creation of self- contained houses, more accurately reflects the buildings' asso- ciation. Recognizing the addition offunctionally specific spaces and growing monumentality over time encourages theories of the occupants' commercial and self-aggrandizing goals. The implications of this study for elite and factional group identity in Mycenaean society are carried further through brief com- parison with other extrapalatial structures at Mycenae and other citadel sites of the Peloponnese. SESSION 2D: GREEK VASE PAINTING AND ICONOGRAPHY THE DIFFUSION OF THE PROTOGEOMETRIC STYLE OF POTTERY IN THE PELOPONNESE: Mary E. Voyatzis, University of Arizona According to the conventional view, the Protogeometric style of pottery originated in Athens and was subsequently adopted in numerous regions throughout the Greek world. Protogeometric pottery (influenced by Athens either directly or indirectly) was produced in such areas as Euboeia, Thessaly, the Argolid, the Corinthia, and Asia Minor. The telltale deco- ration ofcompass-drawn concentric circles and new, improved shapes provide textbook examples of what the new style of pottery looked like. Some areas did not adopt the new style, however. These regions are often considered somewhat pro- vincial and untypical in terms of their ceramic development. I believe that a fresh examination of Early Iron Age ceramic assemblages from the Peloponnese in particular presents a</page><page sequence="30">260 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 different picture: that Attic-influenced Protogeometric style pottery was the exception rather than the rule. Although standard Protogeometric pottery can be observed in the Argolid and the Corinthia, the rest of the Peloponnese reveals many regional variations, from Achaea, Elis, Messenia, and Laconia. From ancient Arcadia virtually no Early Iron Age pottery was uncovered, except from the Sanctuary ofAthenaAlea at Tegea, where recent excavations have yielded large amounts of stan- dard Protogeometric as well as equally large amounts ofLaconian style pottery. It appears that Tegea's proximity to the Argolid exposed the site to the latest ceramic trends, but at the same time, her proximity to Laconia admitted the distinctive Laconian style of pottery into her sphere, thus extending its distribution much further north than previously realized. In short, the spread of the standard Protogeometric style of pot- tery seems to have been largely concentrated in the north- eastern part of the Peloponnese. I conclude that the various other styles of pottery from this region deserve study, not only in relation to the Attic sequence, but also in their own right, and should be recognized, not as peripheral or atypical works, but as part of the rich tapestry of regional styles that comprised Peloponnesian ceramics in the Early Iron Age. THE DANCE OF ARES: DANCING WARRIORS IN EARLY ARCHAIC VASE PAINTING: Lisa Buboltz, Harvard University This paper discusses images of warriors participating in a relatively peaceful activity-dance. The association between war and dance is well-known in Greek literature; this paper explores a variant of this connection in vase painting of the late eighth and early seventh centuries B.C., a period in which the visual theme of dancing warriors becomes unusually promi- nent. This paper suggests that the popularity of this theme reflects two recent developments-the polis and hoplite war- fare-both of which place a new emphasis on community and cooperation. The chronological and geographical range of the images support the contention that the dancing warrior theme is particularly popular in regions that exhibit early and strong polis development, such as Athens and Argos. It also implies that the dancing warrior theme was employed in at least two ways: as a model for young men, and as a emblem for the virtuous adult male citizen. In late eighth-century vase painting, the dancing warrior begins to replace the fighting or mourning warrior. This ex- presses some fundamental changes in archaic Greek society. By celebrating both the aggressive qualities of the warrior and the more civil and cooperative skills of the dancer, the image of the dancing warrior presents a new paradigm for the Greek male: the soldier who creates and cooperates, as well as de- fends and destroys. ORIENTAL AND ORIENTALIZING IN THE NINTH AND EIGHTH CENTURIES: THE CASE OF THE "MAS- TERY OF ANIMALS" COMPOSITION: Alison E. Barclay, University of Toronto Hard evidence for early Iron Age contact between the an- cient Near East and the Aegean is limited to a few sites: nota- bly, Lefkandi, Athens, and Crete. Analysis of the "oriental" models and orientalizing art here yields interesting insights concerning the reception of Near Eastern culture in Greek society. The "Mastery of Animals" composition is used as a vehicle for exploring the reception of oriental iconography in early Crete, where the earliest Iron Age Greek examples ap- pear. The composition's model is manifestly Mesopotamian in origin and can be traced in early Iron Age art from Mesopotamia to the coast of Syria-Palestine, the source for many of the orientalizing elements in Greek art. The early manifestations of the Mistress and Master of Ani- mals fall into two distinctive groups. The first includes those compositions that follow their Near Eastern models very closely in style as well as scheme. Analysis of the typology and medium of the objects on which these compositions appear also demon- strates that the function of the model is as important in the reception process as the artistic elements. The second group includes variants of the composition that retain the overall con- cept of "mastery of animals" but with adaptations befitting in- digenous tastes. By contrast, in the seventh century, a period in which the contactwith "foreign" cultureswas muchwider, the adaptations tend to differ significantly from their Near Eastern models. The symmetrical scheme and some of the animals of the originals are retained, but the end product is very Hellenic in flavor. THE APPROPRIATION OF NARRATIVE ART IN EARLY GREEK POETRY: THE CASE OF ARCHILOCHUS: Kristen Seaman, University of California, Berkeley The birth of narrative in early Greek art is commonly attrib- uted to textual influence, and the earliest narrative images are often discussed as straightforward illustrations of the Homeric epics. But in this paper, I explore the possibility of the reverse phenomenon-the appropriation of artistic imagery in early Greek poetry. In his discussion of Desire (fr. 191), Archilochus alludes to Odysseus's flight from the Cyclopes under the belly of a ram. The phrase in(I6 Kcphi5qv 'uoOEit( both adapts the specific language of the Odyssey (9.432) and recalls the images of the curled-up Odysseus present in seventh-century mate- rial culture (e.g., the RamJug). Archilochus therefore makes Desire vivid for his audience by not only infusing it with physi- cality but also appealing to the sense of sight, participating in what later classical theorists would call dhpyEtca (pictorial vivid- ness), c+avctraoi (visualization), and FKpacotq (description). The preexisting artistic representations of Odysseus's flight would have undoubtedly facilitated the audience's visualiza- tion. And, although Archilochus does not offer an explicit ekphrasis, the phrase 'in6 Knpibtqv EuoOrq functions in an ekphrastic manner, for it provides an overall pause in the action, prompting the audience to recall, indeed ponder, the image of Odysseus-and to consider the ways in which Desire and Odysseus are analogously deceitful. This example thus demonstrates that the relationship of art and text is not as uncomplicated as it often seems and, moreover, affirms the constructive roles that images play in early Greek culture. SPECTATOR TYPOLOGY IN ARCHAIC GREEK ART: Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell, University of St. Thomas The presence of spectators or onlookers in narrative scenes, especially in vase painting, has long been noted by scholars. H.A.G. Bridjer catalogued the characteristics of spectators in some earlyAttic cup painters, but there has not been a system- atic study of the structural role of the spectator in the narra-</page><page sequence="31">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 261 tive. Using theory about narrative microstructure, one can define four categories and six different types of spectator based on their structural role within the image. These include: (1) invested spectators: generally the figure serves as a catalyst in the narrative, overseeing the action; (2) interested specta- tors: these figures are catalysts, but do not play a role in over- seeing the action. Their role as an index is weaker; (3) de- tached spectators: these figures are catalysts, but could also be seen as participating indirectly in the nucleus. They are, how- ever, removed from the space or time of the narrative nucleus; and (4) pure spectators: these figures are not catalysts since they are not involved in the action; when they perform ac- tions, it is typically amongst themselves. There are three sub- categories of these: (a) mimetic: actions mirror those of the narrative nucleus; (b) reactive: actions respond to the narra- tive nucleus; and (c) inert: little response to the nucleus, little action within the figure. This categorization of onlookers opens up possibilities for analyzing the relationship between the viewer and the image, and indicates the importance of theories regarding the gaze and of cultural poetics in their eventual interpretation. THE GOLDEN EAGLES OF ZEUS: PINDAR AND THE AKTAEON KRATER BY THE PAINTER OF THE WOOLLY SATYRS: Jennifer Udell, Hunter College This paper addresses the possible influence of the Pindaric odes upon contemporary fifth-century Athenian vase paint- ing. The focus is upon a krater in the Louvre by the Painter of the Woolly Satyrs (ca. 450-440 B.C.), which depicts the death of Aktaeon. I suggest that certain unusual details present in this specific portrayal of the Aktaeon myth are perhaps visual reflections of Pindar's Pythian 4. This vase painting is not con- sidered an "illustration" of the ode, but rather one that may have derived some of its pictorial detail from the visual imagery of Pindar's poetry, specifically the descriptive phrase "the golden eagles of Zeus" (Pyth. 4.1-5), which I believe may find its graphic counterpart on the krater by the Painter of the Woolly Satyrs. The argument finds additional support in both the tendency of the Greek vase painter, at times, to draw inspiration from literary themes, as the many extant examples of the Homeric epics depicted on pots demonstrate, as well as the acknowledgement of Pindar's expansive reputation, which may have exposed his poetry to the largest possible audience, including vase painters. For instance, the widespread fame enjoyed by Pindar during his career is suggested by the re- gional diversity of those whom he claimed as patrons. Of the 45 victory odes composed by the poet, himself born in Thebes (ca. 518 B.C.), only a fraction were commissioned by Thebans, compared to the many poems he composed on behalf of cli- ents from Sicily, Aigina, and other cities in mainland Greece. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE AULOS: Sheramy D. Bundrick, University of Missouri-Columbia In the fourth century B.C., both Plato and Aristotle speak disparagingly of the aulos, the most important Greek wind instrument. Plato would prefer to ban the aulos from his ideal city (Republic 399d), while Aristotle decries it as being "not a moral instrument but rather one that excites the emotions" (Politics 1341a). Based on the testimony of these authors, it is tempting to characterize the aulos in Athens as a forbidden, rejected object, one that was felt suitable only for satyrs, pros- titutes, and other "outsiders." Is the situation so simple? In this paper, I explore the uses (and abuses) of auloi in Athenian iconography, in an attempt to define prevailing opinions about the instrument. Rather than a universal condemnation of the aulos, the imagery re- veals a degree of acceptance, but a certain wariness too. While Muses were shown with auloi in hand suggesting the proper usage of the instrument, at the same time representations of Marsyas urged caution. The questions surrounding auloi in the Classical period were a product of new developments in musical theory at this time, a growing belief that music had immense power to influence moral character and actions. BRIDGING LOVE AND DEATH: A SPECIAL APULIAN MUSICAL INSTRUMENT: Gina Salapata, Massey University, New Zealand Aladder-shaped musical instrument, often depicted on south Italian, mainly Apulian, vases is commonly, if mistakenly, re- ferred to as a "xylophone" or an "Apulian sistrum." This instru- ment, almost exclusively associated with women, is found in both erotic/nuptial and funerary scenes. Unknown in main- land Greece, it had a long tradition in Magna Graecia, as shown by bronze forerunners from the eighth century B.C., which were in turn derived from Near Eastern prototypes. It is very likely that the instrument passed directly from East to West via the Phoenicians together with the ceremonies it accompanied. On the basis of its eastern origins, its almost exclusive asso- ciation with women, and its appearance in both erotic and funerary scenes, I argue that this special instrument was par- ticularly associated with, and perhaps even originated in, the Adonia, an eastern festival in honor ofAphrodite and Adonis, celebrated only by women all over the Mediterranean. The ritual for Adonis, notorious for his affair with the love goddess but also for his premature tragic death, included both joyful, sensual celebrations for the union of the divinities and exag- gerated manifestations of grief over their separation. The dual association ofAdonis with love and death, in both myth and cult, may have bestowed upon this special Apulian instrument a multivalent symbolism appropriate to both erotic/ nuptial and funerary contexts. Furthermore, the ritual return of Adonis to life, celebrated each year, may have endowed it with eschatological connotations carrying allusions to rebirth; it would have thus appropriately been included in funerary scenes, symbolizing the start of a new life at Elysion. SESSION 2E: ARCHAEOLOGY OF CULT NEW EVIDENCE FOR THE GEOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF THE DELPHIC ORACLE: ACTIVE FAULTS, GAS- EOUS EMISSIONS, AND ARCHITECTURAL ANOMA- LIES IN THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO: John R. Hale, University of Louisville, Jelle de Boer, Wesleyan University,Jeffrey Chanton, Florida State Univer- sity, and Henry Spiller, M.D., Kentucky Regional Poison Center This report presents the results of a five-year interdiscipli- nary study of geological features and archaeological remains linked to the oracular cult at Delphi. The research team in- cluded a geologist, an archaeologist, a chemist, and a toxicolo-</page><page sequence="32">262 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 gist. Beginning in 1996, the team identified and mapped geo- logical faults at Delphi, conducted a field survey of ancient structures associated with those faults, and analyzed samples of spring water and travertine rock to detect both ancient and modern gaseous emissions. The study concluded with research into the physiological and psychological effects of the gases identified at Delphi. Evidence derived from fieldwork and laboratory analysis indi- cates that the Apollo temple was built on bituminous limestone in a zone of cross-faulting, where the intersection of active faults provided pathways through which groundwater and gases rose to the surface. A previously undocumented NW-SE fault, designated the "Kerna" fault, runs through the sanctuary and under the temple. Its line coincides with an alcove on the south side of the cella and an elaborate conduit for spring water built into the foundation. Emissions of light hydrocarbon gases, in- cluding the sweet-smelling intoxicant ethylene, occurred along this fault. Ethylene can induce either a euphoric trance state or (more rarely) a violent delirium. The scientific evidence thus suggests that Plutarch, Pausanias, Diodorus, Strabo, and other ancient authors accurately recorded the unusual geological situ- ation at Delphi, and understood its relation to the siting and design of the Apollo temple, the behavior of the Pythia, and other aspects of the oracular cult. A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON EXCAVATIONS IN THE HERO SHRINE AT NEMEA, 1997-2001: JorgeJ. Bravo, III, University of California, Berkeley Excavations at Nemea, under the direction of Stephen G. Miller of the University of California at Berkeley, were carried out during the summers of 1997 through 2001. A major focus was the excavation of the hero shrine discovered in 1978 (S.G. Miller, ed., Nemea: A Guide to the Site and Museum [Berke- ley 1990] 104-10). Work on the shrine has significantly clari- fied the nature and chronology of the shrine, particularly in its earlier, Archaic phase. In the Archaic period the shrine occupied an extensive, artificially constructed earthen mound having pronounced sloping sides that were supported and demarcated by rubble features. While the western, southern, and eastern limits of the mound correspond approximately to the limits of the later hero shrine enclosure, the mound has been determined to extend northward as a kind of ridged embankment for well over 100 m. The shrine was bounded in part by the Nemea River and by roadways. Numerous votives, especially drinking vessels, were incorporated into the con- struction of the shrine's perimeter. Exploration below the Archaic shrine has yielded some earlier material, but no evi- dence of earlier cult activity. The shrine thus seems to be a new foundation of the sixth century B.C., perhaps to be as- sociated with the organization of the Nemean Games as a Panhellenic festival. The findings suggest a possible close as- sociation between the shrine and the athletic competitions of the Games in all periods of the shrine's use. THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE "PRIEST'S HOUSE" AND THE HOUSES OF CAPE ZOSTER AND AIGINA: Deborah Elizabeth Brown, Bryn Mawr College Not infrequently, excavators of ancient Greek cult sites have labeled buildings that are clearly not temples, propyla, or stoas as "priests' houses." Because of the nonmonumental character of these buildings, scholars have rarely examined the evidence in support of or in opposition to these identifications. The paper begins with a brief overview of the literary and epigraphic evidence for sacerdotal houses. The textual evi- dence indicates that, at some sites, their form and function were analogous to those of private houses, while, elsewhere, they more closely resembled buildings which sheltered large groups of unrelated people, such as ancient hostels and prytaneia. Archaeological examples, which have been identi- fied on the basis of texts, such as the Theokoleon at Olympia, give further support to these observations. From the evidence, I suggest possible archaeological correlates for buildings used to house personnel. In the second part of the paper, I discuss the archaeological evidence at two sites for which we have little textual evidence: the building near the temple ofApollo on Cape Zoster in Attica and the building near the propylon at the Aphaia sanctuary on Aigina. The excavators of both sites originally identified the buildings as priest houses, but their identifications have since been challenged. I argue that the architectural remains, associ- ated finds, and probable reconstructions of cult practices at both sites fit the observations presented in the first part of the paper and conclude that we cannot dismiss the possibility that these buildings were used for housing personnel. FILLING UP THE GREEK TEMPLE: Josephine Shaya, University of Michigan The Lindian temple chronicle is a monumental inscrip- tion that includes both an inventory of ancient votive offer- ings (such as gifts from Herakles, Helen of Troy, and Alexander the Great) said to have once been possessed but then lost by the sanctuary of Athena at Lindos as well as accounts of four epiphanies ofAthena. It is our most detailed source for the perceptions and uses of antiquities in the late Hellenistic period. This paper elaborates the relationship of the inscription with the temple ofAthena at Lindos and its treasures. It exam- ines both the Lindian archaeological record and the chronicle for what they reveal about where and how the stele was dis- played. It argues that the inscription transformed the existing temple treasures into placeholders for the lost ones. Viewed in light of the stele, these treasures became shadows of ancient and renowned offering, a kind of second-rate cast of charac- ters performing the same play. There may have been little ancient to see in the temple of Athena at Lindos in the first century B.C., but the stele, as a historical marker, made the building and its contents resonate with memories of what had once been there. THE USE OF POTTERY IN RITUAL AT ILIION DUR- ING THE ARCHAIC PERIOD: Carolyn Aslan, Koc University, Turkey Recent excavations at the site of Ilion have compiled new evidence for Archaic period activity in the sanctuary area on the western side of the mound. One focal point in the sanctu- aryis astone structure called "AltarB." The areaaroundAltarB contained deposits of primarily late seventh- to sixth-century B.C. pottery, including imported and local fine wares, as well as coarse and gray wares. In particular, numerous fragments of small cups and bowls decorated with swans dominate the as- semblage. Although such vessels are not limited to Ilion, their concentration and quantity around Altar B points to a special meaning for the decoration, and to the actual use of these vessels as part of the ritual.</page><page sequence="33">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 263 TRALLES INSCRIPTION BCH 1883 (#19): INTER- PRETATION AND CONSEQUENCES IN THE STUDY OF SACRED PROSTITUTION: Stephanie Lynn Budin, University of Pennsylvania This paper is an examination of a late second-century C.E. inscription from Tralles, Turkey and the effects that its publi- cation have had on the study of sacred prostitution in the modern literature. The inscription itself comes from an anath- ema dedicated to Zeus by a woman named Aurelia Aimelia upon completing (apparently) her career as a courtesan and "according to the oracle." While the text itself seems to be quite straightforward, preexisting assumptions about sacred prostitution have, throughout the years, added subtexts and imaginative inter- pretations to this brief inscription. Ramsay ("Unedited In- scriptions of Asia Minor," BCH7 [1883] 276-7) himself began this trend by translating Aurelia's profession (ncakAaKlq) as "sacred prostitute." This creative interpretation of the vocabu- lary then came to influence, among others, Liddell and Scott in their Greek-English Lexicon and the Oxford Classical Dictio- nary. In the end, this short inscription has insinuated its way into the sources for the study of sacred prostitution in spite of the fact that, as I argue, it has nothing to do with sacred prostitution at all. The paper is composed of two parts. The first part addresses the text of the inscription itself and a close comparandum, for a complete appreciation ofwhat exactly might be derived from its vocabulary and context. The second part considers the myths and misconceptions which have surrounded this dedi- cation, with a primary focus on the methodology/-ies em- ployed in the study of sacred prostitution in the classical world. The paper ends with a new methodology for the study of sacred prostitution in the classical world. THE LOCAL CULT OF DEMETER IN CILICIA: NEW SCULPTURAL DEPICTIONS: Ale Calik-Ross, Anadolu University, Turkey Representations of Demeter on coins from Cilician cities, and various forms of epigraphical evidence suggest that Demeter was one of the better-known deities in Cilicia during the Greco-Roman period. In recent research in the area, sculptural depictions of Demeter have also been found. A half-statue of a fertility goddess, discovered in the vicinity of Flaviopolis, reflects an alternative way of representing the deity, enabling her to be distinguished from Hecate and Artemis Perasia. The goddess, who is veiled, wears a polos and is adorned with a necklace. She holds a torch in one hand, and ears of corn and an olive branch in the other. There is a similar depiction from the same area, again veiled, in which Demeter holds a long torch. In addition to these two representations, a bust of a woman with comparable features was found in the same part of Cilicia, with an inscription confirming its dedication to Demeter. The sculptural finds and epigraphical evidence indicate the existence of a local sacred place for Demeter, during at least the second half of the second century and the third century A.D. Previously, representations of goddesses with a similar appearance emerged mainly from the southern part ofAnatolia, and they were regarded as Kybele. The overall style of these representations of Demeter seems to be a fusion of the Greek tradition with indigenous Anatolian ones, in that they bear traces of Hittite and Phrygian stylization, as well as displaying typical characteristics of Cilician style. ATHIENOU ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 2001: THE 12TH SEASON OF INVESTIGATIONS AT ATHIENOU- MALLOURA, CYPRUS: Michael K. Toumazou, Davidson College, P. Nick Kardulias, College of Wooster, and Derek B. Counts, Tufts University Following a study season in the summer of 2000, AAP, sponsored by Davidson College and financed through a NSF- REU grant, conducted its 12th season of investigations at Athienou-Malloura between June 1 and July 21. Our work involved some 40 individuals representing 17 U.S. and for- eign institutions. Recent extensive trenching through the Malloura valley by the Cyprus Department of Public Works for the laying of water pipes provided us with an opportunity to gain supple- mentary information on the geomorphology and human use of the valley. Three deeply buried chamber tombs were dis- covered and excavated in an area previously unsuspected to have contained burials. Though poor and architecturally un- impressive, they belong to an unknown cemetery separate from that along the east slope of Maghara Tepesi. The rural sanctuary continued to be the main focus of our investigations. Excavation continued at basal levels in previ- ously investigated areas (EUs 10 and 24). In the latter, sev- eral segments of Archaic walls built on bedrock and in align- ment with previously identified walls were discovered. Two new areas (EUs 28 and 30) were opened up to the north in search of the elusive altar and the north peribolos of the temenos. EU 28 proved to be especially rich in finds but heavily disturbed by looters; several ashlar blocks, seemingly in situ, need to be investigated further. EU 30 is much less disturbed and promises to be productive during next year's excavations. This year's range of finds comprises fragmen- tary limestone statuary, terracotta figurines, ceramic vessels and lamps, limestone utensils, and coins. Some of the most noteworthy finds include a fine wreathed votary head (Clas- sical), a bronze statuette arm, a helmeted terracotta warrior (Archaic) with shield slung on his back, and a ring bezel with a male figure and two (?) goats. In terms of site preservation and consolidation several important tasks were undertaken: the sanctuary's south peribolos was pointed; a large protective shelter was built over the two adjacent water cisterns excavated at Maghara Tepesi; and a wooden staircase was constructed providing easy access to T.27 whose original rock-cut stepped dromos was partially destroyed. SESSION 2F: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: THE ROMANS AT TABLE: PERSPECTIVES ON BANQUETING HORIZONTAL WOMEN: SEX AND THE IDEOLOGY OF CONVIVIAL POSTURE AT ROME: Matthew B. Roller, Johns Hopkins University Historians assert that Roman republican women normally dined seated as their menfolk reclined, while imperial women reclined like men. Reconsideration is necessary. Based mainly on two oft-cited texts (Val. Max. 2.1.2; Isid. 20.11.9), this assertion ignores much countervailing textual and visual evi- dence. Moreover, it neglects the interpenetration of dining posture with other social practices and tensions, which made</page><page sequence="34">264 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 posture meaningful and suggest particular rationales for its representation. I survey the evidence for women's convivial posture through the Antonine period, as represented in (mostly elite) literary texts, on freedmen's funerary monuments from Rome, and in Campanian wallpaintings, whose intended viewers varied in status. The texts overwhelmingly suggest that, in all periods, women of diverse statuses dined reclin- ing alongside men to whom they were sexually connected; all three forms of evidence (texts and paintings especially) show that this posture was erotically charged and might indicate that such women were also more widely sexually available. Conversely, some texts and funerary monuments portray women dining seated alongside reclining men; this posture likely connotes chastity. But the texts locate this practice in the remote past or among foreigners, and the monuments aim to stress a legitimate, exclusive marriage connection-freedmen's special concern. Thus seated women, though their image is ideologically potent, are spe- cial cases. My survey indicates that women of every status commonly dined reclining, even during the Republic. More interest- ingly, it reveals an ideological link between posture and sexuality, which may affect the representations of women's dining posture more than actual social practice does. EATING AND POLITICAL IMAGE MAKING: THE BAN- QUETS OF THE EMPEROR DOMITIAN: John F Donahue, College of William and Mary Abstract not available. THE WAITING SERVANT IN LATER ROMAN ART: Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, McMaster University Literary and epigraphic sources from the early empire attest to the importance attached to the presence of a large staff of specialized servants at the banquets of the wealthy, and to their elegant appearance and sophisticated training. In contrast, banquet scenes in the art of this period, such as the paintings at Pompeii and Herculaneum, place little em- phasis upon the servants who appear in them: they are comparatively insignificant figures who perform essential functions such as bearing cups andjugs of wine. In contrast, by the later empire the waiting servants have become an object of interest in their own right, used to convey mes- sages of the wealth and status of the owners and of the lavishness of the hospitality that they offer their guests. In the third-century Schola Praeconum in Rome, the wall paint- ings simply show rows of servants bearing objects against an architectural background, ready to greet and serve the en- tering guests; while the fourth-century paintings from the Casa sul Celio in Rome present elaborately dressed figures of servants offering wine and large plates laden with food, apparently without any representation of the banquet it- self. Similar figures are found on mosaics and sarcophagi, and a range of iconographical types is developed to convey the various differentiated roles that they serve. The paper studies the iconographical sources of these figures, and compares the use of processions of servants in contexts outside the banquet, as part of the general representation of the life of luxury. DINING WITH NATURE: ROMAN VILLAS AND THE ARCHITECTURAL SETTING OF THE CENA: Jeremy Rossiter, University of Alberta Roman literature provides ample evidence for dining cer- emonies at the villas of the rich, but how were the villas them- selves designed to accommodate these ceremonies? Recent archaeological evidence from villa excavations in Italy and the western provinces is examined to show how architects com- bined practical and aesthetic considerations to create appro- priate contexts for the formal Roman cena. Practical consider- ations included the need to accommodate a variety of dining room furnishings, the demands of dining room "theatre," and the need to provide a comfortable environment in different seasonal conditions. Aesthetic interests encouraged the use of garden settings and natural vistas and led to the employ- ment of striking imagery in dining room interiors, in both permanent features (floors and walls) and portable fixtures (cushions, tapestries, etc.) The architectural response to these different interests reflected both the individual tastes and resources of the villa owner and local building traditions. A range of architectural solutions is presented here to illustrate both the common elements and the diversity of dining room design in Roman villas. Examples used are mainly from re- cently excavated (and probably less well-known) villa sites. Villas to be discussed include the Late Roman villa at Gamzigrad in Serbia (Srejovic 1993), the newly excavated villas at Romana do Rabagal and at Carranque in Spain, the villa at Desenzano in Italy, and the villas at Lalonquette and Seviac in Gaul. Ex- amination of these and other villas will focus on spaces in- tended specifically for dining, noting in particular their siting and orientation, their interior arrangements and decoration, and their construction materials. The paper aims to update earlier discussions of dining architecture in Roman villas (Ellis 1991; Rossiter 1991; Dunbabin 1996) by drawing attention to a number of new villa excavations which provide important additional information about the physical environment of the Roman cena. TEACHING EATING: Susan E. Alcock, University of Michigan This paper seeks to complement the other presentations in this session by outlining some of the advantages of "teaching eating"-that is, the use of food and dining as the pedagogical focus in undergraduate courses in archaeology and classics. By its very nature, of course, the topic itself is capable of winning students' immediate attention, and it thus offers one valuable means of attracting students with little or no prior exposure to the ancient world into taking courses in classics (a matter of ever-growing concern for all of us). The study of food raises many themes important in trying to understand the ancientworld, while also affording opportu- nities for deploying a very varied set of sources and method- ologies. It is possible to move from conditions of agricultural production to issues of diet and health; gender, morality, power, religion, and sex naturally all have important parts to play. In this light, ancient Roman feasting-the specific subject of the present session-represents an especially fruitful topic for analysis. One can observe and assess the dynamics of host and guest, of slave and free, and of male and female, by bringing into the discussion a very wide range of textual, art historical, and archaeological information. And, as everywhere with the</page><page sequence="35">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 265 study of food and "foodways," there is the ubiquitous obbligato of modern experience (their own dinner parties) againstwhich students can map the distance between the world of ancient Rome and that of their own experience. SESSION 2G: WORKSHOP: PRACTICAL FIELD COMPUTING Several AIA workshops in the last fewyears have focused on showcasing new technologies, and others have focused on the more abstract aspects of digital archiving and computer use. Few, however, have focused on the practical uses of tech- nology in fieldwork and publishing. This workshop fills this gap. Each 40-minute paper will demonstrate one specific skill or task. The goals of the workshop are to reach the widest possible audience and to ensure that participants leave the workshop with both the knowledge and the tools needed to perform specific computer-related tasks. In order to obtain these goals, the workshop format is as follows: (1) all demonstrations are presented on desktop software (Mac OS or Windows), which ensures that the demonstrations are of practical use to as many participants as possible; (2) each paper focuses on a single task, and demonstrates all procedures necessary to complete the task; and (3) we will provide participants with a CD-ROM containing tutorial files and software demos. The following is a list of titles and software: (1) "Rapid Ceramic Vector Illustrations for Publication" (Freehand and Illustrator); (2) "Relational Databases: RecordingYour Pottery and Small Finds" (Filemaker Pro); and (3) "GIS and Adaptive Sampling Strategies: Improving the Efficiency of Pedestrian Survey" (ArcView with Avenue scripts). Panel:John Wallrodt, University of Cincinnati; Sebastian Heath, American Numismatic Society; James Conolly, Univer- sity College London, U.K. SESSION 2H: COLLOQUIUM: GOLD MEDAL SESSION IN HONOR OF ROBERT McC. ADAMS FROMJARMO TO SUMER: THE URBAN REVOLUTION IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA: Patty Jo Watson, Washington University in St. Louis Robert McC. Adams's archaeological career began with field- work at the 8,500 year-old agropastoral village ofJarmo, north Iraq, in 1950-1951 when he was an anthropology graduate student at the University of Chicago. Although his M.A. thesis was based onJarmo artifact analysis, Adams's dissertation re- search, as well as much of his later scholarship, was focused upon events and processes that took place during the fourth to third millennia B.C. in southern Mesopotamia. His field- work there and his comprehensive publications concerning the rise of the Bronze Age civilization in the Mesopotamian alluvium laid the foundation for subsequent studies describing and explaining the origins of state-based, socioeconomically stratified societies at various times and places in the human past. In this paper, I compare Adams's work on the origins of Mesopotamian civilization with that now being carried out in other world areas where pristine transitions took place from food-producing "Neolithic" lifeways to urbanized, state-based civilizations. THE LAND BEHIND URUK: HansJ. Nissen, The Free University of Berlin, Germany By now, archaeological surface surveys have become an es- tablished line of investigation in Mesopotamian archaeology, and in the Near East in general. Since they have been intro- duced to Mesopotamia Robert McC. Adams has been most active and influential in carrying them through as a powerful tool. While before research was concentrated on excavating towns and cities, neglecting their countryside and thus one of their most important constituents, the new tool opened the way for a new understanding of the political context. In this sense, the survey of the Uruk countryside proved particularly fruitful because of the mass of information already accumu- lated by the many years of archaeological investigation within the city limits. Together with subsequent surveys this new approach has since led to changing our concept of Mesopotamian history. DISTANT LANDS: ADAPTING REGIONAL ARCHAEO- LOGICAL SURVEY TO THE STUDY OF OTHER CIVILIZATIONS: Henry T. Wright, University of Michigan New landscapes have challenged survey archaeologists to transform regional studies. Even as Adams himself is develop- ing new approaches to Mesopotamia, his colleagues and stu- dents and their students are on the ground in such diverse locales as highland Peru, central Mexico, central Madagascar, eastern Pakistan, and central China. In addition to applying new technologies, survey archaeologists are making new inte- grations of the evidence from documents and excavations, and using new assumptions based in different philosophical perspectives. This presentation will illustrate a few of these recent efforts. ENVIRONMENT AND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS IN GREATER MESOPOTAMIA: TonyJ. Wilkinson, The Oriental Institute, University of Chicago In the area of greater Mesopotamia irrigation systems have a remarkably long history, and more than anyone else Robert McC. Adams has made a major contribution to our under- standing of how these systems developed through time. Fol- lowing a brief outline of the work of Adams on early irriga- tion systems, I will place the development of irrigation sys- tems within their natural and environmental context. On face value, irrigation systems of the Mesopotamian plains required enormous expenditures of manpower to dig them. In this paper I will first examine how such vast labor projects may have influenced the trajectory of urban growth during late prehistory and early historic time, and second I will dis- cuss alternative ways that irrigation channels may have devel- oped, in part through natural agencies.</page><page sequence="36">266 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 WHITHER THE TIGRIS?: Elizabeth C. Stone, SUNY at Stony Brook When Robert McC. Adams conducted his surveys of south- ern Iraq, it was widely believed that the Tigris played an insig- nificant role in the Mesopotamian urban landscape between the third and the first millennia B.C. Since that time Gasche, Cole, and myself have independently identified Tigris chan- nels in northern and central Babylonia, respectively, that played an important role in settlement in the early second millen- nium, and Steinkeller has argued based on textile evidence that the channel that fed Adab was called the Tigris in Ur III times. This paper will use these data, interpretation of various kinds of satellite imagery, and Adams's recent work with the CORONA pictures to develop a new evaluation of the role of the Tigris in early settlement and abandonment patterns in southern and central Babylonia. FROM KLM TO CORONA: USING SATELLITE PHO- TOGRAPHY TOWARD A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF FIFTH-FOURTH MILLENNIUM B.C. LANDSCAPES IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA: Jennifer R. Pournelle, University of California, LaJolla Prevailing theories of 'Ubaid social evolution in southern Mesopotamia presume a uniform, arid landscape transited by Tigris and Euphrates distributaries. These theories hold that it was the introduction of well-attested early Samarran hydro- logic management technologies from the northern alluvium to the south that began the punctuated evolution of Mesopotamian irrigation schemes. New research, using de- classified CORONA satellite photography to integrate recent geomorphologic, paleoclimatic, and excavation evidence within a comprehensive examination of the southern alluvium, casts serious doubt on the landscape characterization underlying this model. The mid fifth-mid fourth millennium B.C. alluvial landscape consisted in large part, not of desert or steppe, but of semi-permanent marshlands. This finding requires a com- prehensive reassessment of southern Mesopotamian hydrostrategies leading to the 'Ubaid-Uruk transition. Since joining the "type" multidisciplinary team atJarmo, Adams's legacy to the future of the field includes his role in adding imaging technologies, key to such extensive reassessments, to the essential archaeological toolkit. SESSION 3A: ANATOLIA I LYDIAN AND PERSIAN PERIOD SITE DISTRIBUTION IN LYDIA: Christopher H. Roosevelt, Cornell University This paper presents the results of recent research based on a study of museum collections and an extensive survey of burial mounds and other selected sites in the regions of Manisa and western Ugak, Turkey, which were once part of ancient Lydia. What we know about this region in the Lydian and Persian periods is based primarily on the long-term excavations at its urban capital Sardis; the relationship between Sardis and other Lydian and Persian period centers of prosperity in Lydia is virtually unknown. In order to understand better Lydia as a whole (assuming a degree of administrative continuity from Lydian to Persian times that is supported by archaeological and textual sources), this research focuses on the distribution of Lydian and Persian period activity throughout the region through study of provenienced objects in museum collections and locations of sites, especially tumuli, or burial mounds. These monuments are the most conspicuous markers of Lydian and Persian period presence, and their sizes, locations, and num- bers are understood to indicate general areas of settlement and prosperity. The locations of these hypothesized and other known areas of settlement, and investigations of natural land- scape divisions, agricultural and other resource potentials, and routes of communication establish hypothetical territories within Lydia and thus make possible broad interpretations of the social, political, and economic organization of the region. SARDIS: HIGHLIGHTS OF FIELDWORK RESULTS, 1998-2001: Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr., Univer- sity of California, Berkeley Excavation clarified aspects of the Lydian city in the sev- enth and sixth centuries B.C. Lydian city defenses had been understood prior to 1999 primarily from a short segment, the exterior-interior orientation of which was uncertain. Other segments located in 1999 and 2000 show that Lydian Sardis had much the same location as the Roman city, and an intra- mural area of about 115 ha (in many places the Late Roman city wall had been built near or on the Lydian city wall). The newly located wall segments were built with a stone socle sup- porting coursed mudbrick; mudbrick courses were interlaced at ca. 1 m intervals with sapling layers. Parts of all newly located segments stand 8-11 m high (and are submerged in later occupation, alluvial, and colluvial fills). One small corner of a Lydian house, destroyed ca. 550 B.C., yielded ca. 50 house- hold artifacts; in addition to standard items and food remains, the assemblage included a wooden comb, iron hoops from a keg or barrel, and an ivory toggle. A freshly opened and van- dalized Lydian tumulus tomb, located 4 km from Sardis, was recorded by the Sardis Expedition. The grave chamber, rect- angular with a pitched ceiling, is noteworthy for the vivid colors of its painted decoration, Phrygian-style gable motifs, faux rush-matting ceiling pattern, "bunk-bed" arrangement of (seven) funeral couches, and high quality ornament of marble klinai and door leaf. NEW WORK ON THE TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS AT SARDIS: THEORIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, 1988-2000: Fikret K. Yegiil, University of California, Santa Barbara The Temple of Artemis at Sardis, one of the seven largest of all Greek temples, was excavated by the Princeton Expedi- tion during 1911-1914, and partially published in 1922-1925. Subsequent work in the 1970s by the Harvard Archaeological Expedition produced valuable information, although major problems concerning the building's complicated history and unusual design remained. New field investigations and a full architectural documentation of the temple since 1988 prom- ise to answer some of these questions and establish new direc- tions in understanding this celebrated structure. The architectural outline of the Temple of Artemis was conceived and continued to be developed in the century or so following the death ofAlexander the Great, a period of change and innovation in Greek temple design. Its pseudo-dipteral</page><page sequence="37">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 267 arrangement represents an important phase in the evolution of the building. The temple continued to change during the Roman Imperial era when the cella was divided into two to incorporate the Imperial cult. The idea of an Antonine cult in the temple was further strengthened in 1997 by the discovery of a colossal bearded head, possibly Commodus. We are beginning to see that much that was assumed to be of Greek origin in the design and construction of the temple at Sardis, such as the entire exterior peristyle, or the unusual arrangement ofporch colonnades, are actually of Roman work, with credible parallels in the West. Diverging from the aes- thetics of Hellenistic models, the Temple of Artemis at Sardis appears to be a transitional and unfinished experiment in Greco-Roman architecture in Anatolia. SEAL IMAGES FROM ACHAEMENID DASKYLEION: Deniz Kaptan, Bilkent University, Turkey Excavations carried out in Daskyleion in the 1950s revealed the richest assemblage ofseal impressions unearthed in Anatolia dating from the Achaemenid Persian period. Soon after their discovery a selection of seal impressions were presented in preliminary excavation reports. A small number of inscribed seals were also published around this time. The research project on the entire assemblage, however, has been carried out in recent years and its full publication is presently in press. The seal impressions appear on bullae, a large number of which bear impressions of papyrus fiber on the back indicating that theywere originally attached to written documents. These perished documents, from which only the clay bullae with seal impressions survived, were most probably kept in a local store- house of the satrapal center for archival purposes. So far no other contemporaneous archive is known in Anatolia. The seal images, 185 in number, fall into three major groups: those in the manner of Persian CourtArt, Persianizing, and Greek. These groups display a variety of styles and sub- jects. The seals following the style and iconography of the center of the Achaemenid empire include royal name seals inscribed in Old Persian and Babylonian. Persianizing seals are particularly significant since they comprise the largest collec- tion of the so-called Graeco-Persian seals coming from the same archaeological context. This talk discusses how the group of Persianizing seals from Daskyleion offers the potential of serving as a reference source for seal studies and representa- tional art of the Achaemenid Persian period. CYBELE AT TROY: THE TERRACOTTA FIGURINES: Blanche Menadier, University of Sydney, Australia Recent excavations at Troy have brought to light ca. 1,500 new terracotta figurines from the lower city, the West Sanctu- ary, and an ancient dump probably to be associated with the Athena Sanctuary which surmounted the Bronze Age citadel. A considerable number of these are representations ofCybele. These add to the repertoire of Cybele types reported from previous excavations by Schliemann and Blegen, and many come from more clearly defined contexts. In general the figu- rines from the West Sanctuary appear to be inferior in fabric and workmanship to those associated with domestic contexts. A similar situation occurred at Pergamon. The two nearby hill top shrines to Cybele, Mamurt Kale and Kapikaya, have pro- duced figurines which differ significantly from those in the city of Pergamon itself, so much so that G. Kleiner (Berlin 1942) questioned whether the Mamurt Kale sanctuary should be connected to Pergamon. At Troy the differences are not as pronounced, but they do exist. This paper will offer a brief analysis of the variations in types between the West Sanctuary and the lower city, and offer suggestions to explain the typo- logical and qualitative differences among the Cybele figurines in domestic and public contexts at Troy. SESSION 3B: GREEK SCULPTURE HEROES AND ATHLETES AT OLYMPIA: THE ACHAE- AN DEDICATION: Aileen Ajootian, University of Mississippi According to Pausanias (5.25.8), Onatas's Early Classical Achaean Dedication, east of the Zeus Temple, depicted the moment when the Achaian warriors, to determine which one would fight Hektor, watched as King Nestor shook lots out of a helmet. While Pausanias described the monument fully, he did not mention that the semicircular base for the bronze warrior statues, and a smaller round one for Nestor are some 9 m apart, or that a north-south road running through the sanctuary bisected the space between them. The narrative enacted by the statues was perhaps initiated by passersby who walked between the bases, entering an atmosphere defined and enclosed by the sculptures. The Homeric story came alive whenever viewers crossed into the statues' environment, par- ticipating in the accomplishment of the episode,just as they anticipated the outcome when they heard the Iliad recited. There is another way in which this complex monument may have fused the heroic world and contemporary Panhellenic experience. The choice of Hektor's opponent by kleros, or lot, was also the process used in sacred athletics to assign lanes in equestrian competitions and foot races, or heats and partners in wrestling events. Lucian (Hermotimos 40) describes pankratiasts standing in a circle as aJudge inspected lots they had chosen. The heroic bronze Achaeans, atop one of the earliest semicircular statue bases in Greece, perhaps replicated the actual experience of Classical competitors at Olympia, bring- ing to life a vignette resonating with Homeric meaning and symbolizing Olympic athletics. THE NEO-ATTIC NIOBID RELIEFS: PHIDIAN INNO- VATION AND ZEUS'S THRONE: Jean Sorabella, Co- lumbia University Around 430 B.C., Phidias portrayed the massacre of the Niobids on the throne of the great Zeus at Olympia. Reliefs of the first and second centuries A.D. in Florence, Kassel, Modena, St. Petersburg, and Rome reflect the composition and have been used to reconstruct it. The innovative handling of the subject and its meaning on Zeus's throne have received less comment. In this paper, I seek Phidias's contribution to the iconography of the Niobids by comparing earlier representa- tions of the theme in art and poetry. Images of the Niobids are rare in Archaic and early Classical Greek art. Examples occur on Tyrrhrenian amphorae in Ham- burg and Tarquinia and a red-figure krater in Paris. The paint- ers of these vases downplay the suffering of the children and so affirm the gods' right to punish. The version of the story in</page><page sequence="38">268 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 Homer (II. 24.602-20) presents it in a more ambivalent light and leaves the audience tojudge whether their action wasjust or exaggerated. The innocence of the Niobids in the face of the gods' attack creates an imbalance abhorrent to the ethos of noble warfare. The Neo-Attic reliefs suggest that Phidias's friezes divided Apollo and Artemis, introduced space between the figures, included Niobe, and varied the poses of her children. By emphasizing both the sufferings of mortals and thejustice of the gods, he maintained the moral weight of both sides, instilled his image with the tension and subtlety of poetry, and made high claims for art on the throne of Zeus. HELLENISTIC BRONZE STATUETTES FROM DOMES- TIC CONTEXTS: ISSUES OF FORM AND FUNCTION: Heather E Sharpe, Indiana University It is generally accepted that by the Hellenistic period free- standing bronze statuettes were no longer simply used as votives but were also put on display in private households. Indeed, scholars often cite the story of Lysippos's statuette of Herakles Epitrapezios made for Alexander the Great in support of this idea of a change in the setting and function of small bronzes. Some questions remain, however, regarding exactly when this shift occurred and the exact function of the bronzes in their domestic setting; were they simply decorative or did they re- tain a religious function? The archaeological evidence is scant, but a small number of bronze statuettes have been excavated from Greek domestic contexts, which can be firmly dated to the Hellenistic period. In this paper I present examples of bronze statuettes from domestic contexts indicating that, as early as the mid third century B.C., a shift in practice did occur. Furthermore,judg- ing by the archaeological contexts, the bronzes do display a marked religious character and were not merely decorative. The subjects portrayed also reflect their religious function; included among my examples are a libation bearer, a female offerant, and a number of herms. Although numerous bronzes of Hellenistic date are known to exist, research on them is often hampered by a lack of information regarding when they were made, how they were used, and where they were displayed. By taking a closer look at some of the bronzes from domestic contexts, I can supply at least some answers to these questions. THE VICTORY OF LOVE: A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE APHRODITE OF MELOS IN ITS ORIGINAL CONTEXT: Rachel Kousser, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University The celebrated statue of the Aphrodite of Melos has been lauded as a timeless ideal of female beauty, but little scholarly attention has been paid to its contemporary Hellenistic cul- tural and civic setting. This paper draws upon newly available archival, sculptural, and archaeological evidence to advance a new interpretation of the statue's social and topographic con- text. A careful reading of the archival evidence for the discovery of the sculpture suggests that it was found in an architectural niche, together with fragments of an arm and hand holding an apple, and a dedicatory inscription from a gymnasium offi- cial (IG 12.3.1091). New photographic documentation and measurements of the hand and arm fragments demonstrate that they are of the same technique and weathering. They should therefore belong to the sculpture, which should then be reconstructed as Aphrodite holding an apple in token of victory in the Judgment of Paris. Recent investigations of the topography of Melos support the thesis advanced here that the statue formed part of the sculptural decoration of a gymnasium. I argue that the fact that the statue was located in a major civic and educational institution of the Hellenistic city is critical to its meaning. Literary evidence, particularly Isokrates (Helen 41-9; see also Planudean Appendix 178; Hymn 5.15-28; Heroides 16.83-8), suggests that in the Late Classical and Hellenistic periods the Judgment of Paris was reinterpreted as an allegory for man's choice of a way of life. For the young men attending the gymnasium, the sensuous image ofAphrodite was the embodi- ment of the most desirable goals in life, love, and beauty; the goddess promised individual fulfillment through romantic love, at a time when political power and martial success were increas- ingly off-limits to inhabitants of the Greek polis. O SISTER, WHO ART THOU? THE TANGLED ICO- NOGRAPHY OF SCULPTURES OF MUSES: Natalie Taback, Harvard University The nine Muses, the Greek goddesses of intellectual inspira- tion, are frequently indistinguishable from one another in sculp- tural form. Body pose and drapery scheme are often not suffi- cient to discern which of the nine is depicted. The Seated Muse TurningAround type, for instance, appears with a diptych on the Archelaos relief and a mask on the Halicarnassos Base, suggesting two different Muses. Similarly, the Melpomene Miletus type at times holds not a mask but a kithara; thus she is not exclusively Melpomene. Even attributes, when preserved, are not a secure means of identifying individual Muses since they are often modern restorations; in addition, certain ones, such as scrolls, can be associated with more than one Muse. This paper attempts to offer an elucidation of the elusive identities of sculptures of Muses. It is proposed that the tangled iconogra- phy of the sculptures is more understandable if viewed as a reflection of the group nature of the sisters: born on the same day, ever engaged with one another. Though governing her own realm, an individual Muse, when represented in sculptural form, seems to have evoked the collective category "Muses." Muse iconography would therefore be almost interchangeable, a factor which united the sisters visually, with elements selected and combined in various ways. Since the Muses' tangled iconog- raphy complicates the formation of a typology, this paper pro- poses a new method of classifying the sculptures, one with less restrictive categories allowing for an overall presentation of the Muses' common iconographic repertoire. A BEJEWELED SIREN FROM MEMPHIS: Alexis Q. Castor, Franklin and Marshall College In 1851, Auguste Mariette discovered a marble siren at the Serapaeum at Memphis. Now in the Cairo Museum, the siren originally belonged to a larger decorative program that in- cluded sphinxes, panthers, peacocks, and lions, all dating to the mid third century B.C. The Memphis siren is notable for the extravagant amount ofjewelry--earrings, necklace, and breast band-carefully carved on the statue. Her strap neck- lace with seed pendants was a favorite type of Hellenisticjew- elry, but her other ornaments are more unusual. The large hoop earrings are unparalleled among real examples ofHelle-</page><page sequence="39">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 269 nistic earrings. Most striking is the wide strap strung with an assortment of amulets that crosses her upper body. Such amu- lets are found more commonly on statues of goddesses, such as the popular Artemis of Ephesos. Taken as a whole, this sculp- ture offers one of the most detailed representations ofjewelry that survives from the Hellenistic era. After a brief survey of the siren as represented in contem- porary Egyptian and Greek sculpture, terracotta, and other minor arts, I will focus on the jewelry that adorns this siren. What other female figures sport similar ornaments? How do these images compare to known Hellenistic jewelry? What specific parallels may be found for the amulets? Certain pen- dants are associated especially with eastern types of jewelry, others may carry magical connotations. Wooing with both her music and beauty, beauty that was enhanced by her jewelry, the siren from Memphis provides an important example of Hellenistic ideals of feminine charm. SESSION 3C: BUILDING ROME THE PANTHEON OF AGRIPPA, THE FRIEZE FROM SAN LORENZO, AND A BUILDING ON THE HATERII RE- LIEFS: Pieter B.Ef. Broucke, Middlebury College Six fragments of an ancient frieze, now in the Capitoline Museum, were used as spoliaat San Lorenzo fuori le Mura (CM 99, 100, 102, 104, 105, 107). In 1937, a smaller seventh frag- ment was extracted from a Medieval structure at the Porticus of Octavia (CM2426). The frieze depicts bucrania alternating with sets of either naval motifs or priestly instruments. Two small portraits recently identified as Augustus and Agrippa date the fragments to immediately after 29 B.C. With a height of 0.59 m and a reconstructed length of at least 40.36 m, the frieze featured in a substantial building. The findspot of the seventh fragment situates the origin of the frieze in the Campus Martius while the portraits point to an Agrippan commission. The naval imagery refers to Actium, but the priestly instruments indicate a religious building rather than a victory monument. They find, in fact, close parallels in the 28 decorative panels on Hadrian's Pantheon. I argue that the frieze belonged to the Pantheon of Agrippa. This attribution permits the identification of a building on a Haterii relief as the Agrippan Pantheon restored by Domitian following the fire ofA.D. 80. After it burnt again under Trajan, Hadrian completely rebuilt the structure. Perhaps, like some caryatids, parts of the frieze were salvaged from the ruins and carted off toward Tivoli. Temporarily deposited at the begin- ning of the Via Tiburtinajust outside Rome, the blocks never reached Tivoli and became recycled in the nearby church of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura. PERFECT TEN: VAULTING THE PANTHEON: Rabun Taylor, Harvard University This paper considers the process of building the concrete vault of the Pantheon, contending that the engineers took an experimental approach by carefully testing designs on the ground and rehearsing the assembly and easing process. There were four logistical phases, none of which has ever been ad- equately discussed. 1. Centering: Somehow the great meridional ribs of wood, each several tons in weight, had to be positioned and then held in place while the circumferential struts were installed. The coffer molds slid freely on the centering surface, other- wise they would have thwarted decentering. 2. Application of the concrete: Never did the centering have to bear more than a fraction of the liquid weight of the entire dome, since the liquid concrete below was hardening into a self-supporting compression ring as additional liquid was added to it in layers. As the effects of weight increased toward the top, thin layering took precedence over speed. 3. Easing: Loosening the centering from the high pressure of the concrete surface required successfully springing strate- gically placed wedges. The eased centering, once stripped of its skin and the coffer molds, served as a scaffolding framework for the decorators. 4. Decentering: Centering could not be removed in the manner that it was built. I discuss the intricate process of disassembling the wooden armature without cranes and with- out damaging the building. I suggest further that two ostensibly aesthetic decisions, the inclusion of an oculus and the choice of 28 meridians, may have pragmatic origins. EVOKING THE ANTIQUE: ORIGINS, PATRONAGE, AND VIEWER RECEPTION OF TRANSVERSE CELLA TEMPLES IN REPUBLICAN ROME: PeterDe Staebler, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Much attention has been paid to issues surrounding the introduction of Hellenistic temple architecture in Republican Rome. Round and peripteral temples have been analyzed in terms of the semiotics of their plans and elevations, decora- tion, construction materials, and the relationship between these aspects and the identities of the patrons. An important temple type absent from these discussions is the transverse cella temple, one with the cella wider than the porch. This paper attempts to reconstruct the "Bildsprache" of this pecu- liar temple type by offering new suggestions concerning its architectural origin and exploring what is known of the pa- trons of the attested temples of this type in Rome. The Greek precedents cited by Vitruvius (4.8.4) for the type (the Erechtheum, and Temple of Athena at Sounion) are unconvincing, yet the notion of a Greek origin has never been challenged. Moreover, when the unorthodox architec- tural plan of the transverse cella temple is discussed at all in modern scholarship, it is usually explained away as being con- nected with exigencies of space. This paper will argue that the origins of the transverse cella temple form may be found, not in the Greek world, but in a class of small structures of unknown precise function in Etrusco- Italic sanctuaries. In the three known instances of transverse cella temples built at Rome (the Temples ofVeiovis, Dioscuri in Circo, and Concordia), I will offer compelling reasons, hav- ing to do with cult and/or topographical setting, why the particular patrons would have wished to build a type of temple whose form carried an old, Italic resonance. THE TEMPLUM PACIS AND ITS REPUBLICAN MANU- BIAL AESTHETIC: Megan Hertzig, Institute of Fine Arts, NewYork University The Templum Pacis within the Imperial tradition of build- ing continues to present a curious and unexplained aesthetic. It is possible to reexamine the Templum Pacis as a monument</page><page sequence="40">270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 designed to evoke the manubial temples and porticoes of the Republican period. Vespasian drew from the monuments of Republican Rome in an effort to set himself and his newly founded dynasty apart from his predecessors. The Templum Pacis was built ex manubiis to commemorate Vespasian's victory over the Jews. Like the many republican buildings filled with war booty, the Templum Pacis contained not only the spoils from theJewish campaign but also master- pieces of Greek sculpture and painting (Pliny NH 34.84). In placing the Greek works together with the captured Jewish relics Vespasian's display would have recalled the earlier repub- lican repositories for the Greek spoils, the manubial dedica- tions. Furthermore, the eclectic nature of the Templum Pacis "art collection" is pointedly different from the thematic sculp- ture arrangement within the Porticus of Pompey or the highly programmatic one of Augustus's Forum and evokes the par- ticular aesthetic of the republican settings. Moreover, recent excavations of the area offer new information about the build- ing. Although Vespasian had avast amount of money to spend it is now clear that the materials used were intended to give it an austere, old-fashioned appearance. Also, in its architectural plan and its austerity, the Templum Pacis makes a conscious break with traditional imperial buildings, recalling instead the manubial monuments of Republican Rome. THE CAPITOLIUM VETUS AND THE FLAVIANS: A NEW INTERPRETATION OF CIL 6.401: Gil Renberg, Duke University This paper argues that CIL 6.401, a dedicatory inscription that has received little attention, is significant to Roman to- pography because it may record an unknown restoration of the Capitolium Vetus, and perhaps indicates an earlier restora- tion under Domitian. The inscription states that an aedes of Jupiter,Juno, and Minerva was rebuilt in 139 C.E. by a father and son named Titus Flavius Vestinus. Since it cannot refer to Jupiter's Capitoline temple, it must refer to Rome's other Capitolium, located on the Quirinal. Furthermore, the text provides two indications of a link between the Flavians and the Capitolium Vetus: first, the primary dedicant appears to have been associated with the Flavians, probably as an imperial freedman; and second, the unusual identification of Minerva as "Augusta" may suggest a link to imperial cult and thus to her famous devotee, Domitian. Although the precise location of the Capitolium Vetus has not been established, it almost cer- tainly stood near the Templum Gentis Flaviae. A connection between the Flavians and this Quirinal landmark has not been proposed, but this temple most likely was important to their clan, especially if it did share their Sabine origins. The Capitolium Vetus, then, may have been among the monu- ments on the Quirinal that were built or rebuilt by the Flavians, perhaps after the fire of Nero. Decades later, the structure may again have been in need of repair, and one of Domitian's imperial freedmen, out of a sense of loyalty to his former patron, undertook its restoration. EMPERORS AND ARCHITECTS: APOLLODORUS, RABIRIUS, AND HADRIAN:James C. Anderson, Jr., University of Georgia Among upper level personnel introduced, or retained, in the imperial service by Trajan, the architectus Apollodorus of Damascus appears to have had one of the longest and most spectacularly successful careers. An assessment of the sources, written and archaeological, for his contribution to imperial architecture must focus on three significant questions in an attempt to lead to a clearer understanding of both the career itself and of the origins and intent of the extensive building program in the city of Rome attributed to him. The three essential topics investigated in this paper are: (1) the career path ofApollodorus, and how he came to his position of domi- nance in the relatively new opera Caesaris, the imperial archi- tecture ministry probably created under Domitian; (2) how much of the architecture dedicated in Rome during Trajan's reign originated with Trajan and Apollodorus, and how much had in fact already been begun, or proposed, by Domitian and his architectus Rabirius; and (3) the evidence for continua- tion of Apollodorus's position after Trajan's death, especially his putative responsibility for designing the Pantheon during the first decade of Hadrian's principate, and the supposed conflict between long-time architectus and new emperor over the Temple ofVenus and Rome. In considering Apollodorus's career, the paper touches on the history and the ideology that informed Trajan's building program, as well as those of his predecessor (Domitian) and successor (Hadrian) in reshaping the topography of ancient Rome. PORK BARRELS AND TRAFFIC CONES: ROAD WORKS IN EARLY IMPERIAL ROME: Matthew Fullerton, Uni- versity of Alberta This paper evaluates road works in early Imperial Rome. In particular, it studies the personal gains and benefits that the repair and maintenance of city streets brought to the emper- ors of the first century A.D. (Augustus through Domitian). The paper asks the following questions: What were the known developments in the first century A.D.? Did each emperor follow a consistent program of road maintenance? Finally, why did each emperor contribute to the repair of roads and the improvement of streets within the city? The first part of the paper summarizes the contents of the so-called Lex lulia Municipalis and reassesses its value towards the recreation of late republican and early imperial road maintenance. The sec- ond part uses archaeological, epigraphic, and literary evidence to analyze emperors' contributions towards the preservation of roads and to draw conclusions on their motives. The third and final part of the paper speculates on each emperor's per- sonal motives for the undertaking, continuation, or cessation of road works. Were they acting on the need to repair the city's streets or were they attempting to woo the Roman citi- zens with political pork barreling? SESSION 3D: ROMAN SCULPTURE AND ITS MEANINGS MARSYAS AUGUR: A PLEBEIAN AUGUR IN THE TIME OF SULLA?: PeterJustin Moon Schertz, University of Southern California The earliest known representation of Marsyas in ancient Rome stood in the Forum Romanum and showed him not as the ill-fated discoverer ofAthena's flutes, still less as the bound</page><page sequence="41">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 271 or hanging victim of Apollo's punishment; rather, it depicted a silens standing with his right arm raised and carrying a wine- skin on his left shoulder. In Roman thought, this statue was identified as an indicium libertatis and was closely associated with plebeian rights. Scholars who have written on this statue (e.g., M. Torelli and F. Coarelli) have generally located the source of these plebeian connotations in the presumed dedi- cator of the statue, the plebeian leader C. Marcius Rutilius Censorinus, whose descendent, L. Marcius Censorinus, de- picted the statue on coins issued at the height of the Sullan civil war in the 80s B.C.E. This politico-historical reading of the statue does not, how- ever, fully account for the presence of the statue on these coins. In Rome, Marsyas was also regarded as a teacher of augury and an attendant of Liber Pater, one of the preemi- nent plebeian deities of the Aventine Triad; thus, this paper argues that the depiction of the Forum Marsyas on these coins reflects not only the plebeian ancestry of the Censorini, but also evokes a specifically plebeian augural figure at a time when augury and the augural college (as Sulla's own coinage of the period makes clear) were politically contentious issues. ARCHITECTURAL IMAGES IN ROMAN HISTORICAL RELIEF: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SIGHTLINES: Melanie D. Grunow, University of Michigan Nearly half of the surviving historical reliefs from the city of Rome feature recognizable images of religious and civic build- ings. This paper examines one overlooked aspect of the topo- graphic context of these reliefs: sightlines to the building(s) represented on them. These sightlines not only contributed to the recognizability of architectural images but also marked the depicted buildings as significant. The reliefs drew atten- tion to chosen landmarks, thereby encouraging viewers to read the landscape in terms of imperial ideology. For example, the Valle-Medici relief with an image of the Temple of Mars Ultor once belonged to the Julio-Claudian Ara Gentis Iuliae on the Capitoline Hill. Tellingly, the relief depicts a frontal view of the temple facade, a view available only from the Capitoline. By inviting the viewer to look at the Temple of Mars Ultor, the Ara Gentis Iuliae simultaneously deemphasized the Temple ofJupiter Optimus Maximusjust a few steps away (perhaps an intentional reminder ofAugustus's transfer of rituals from the Capitoline to Mars Ultor). This type of topographic relationship between relief and temple can be analyzed for the Temple of Quirinus, the Trajanic Extispicium relief, the Anaglypha, and the Arch of Constantine, among others. Although the monuments depicted in relief varied over time (early reliefs feature recent construction, whereas later reliefs depict the emperor in traditional contexts such as the Forum or the Capitoline), the deliberate exploita- tion of sightlines continued, forming a series of conscious topo- graphic cross-references in the urban landscape of Rome. RECUT IMPERIAL PORTRAITS: NUANCES AND WIDER CONTEXT: Karl Galinsky, University of Texas at Austin Instead of being an isolated phenomenon amounting to damnatio memoriae (a term of convenience), the reuse and recutting of portraits of dishonored Roman emperors need to be viewed in a larger context. One salient perspective is that, in most cases, sufficient vestiges of the old portrait are pre- served to reveal its identity. The process is similar, in the larger domain of sculptural recycling, to the deliberate preservation of traces of the old hairstyle amid the new in female portraits. While meant to dishonor, the recutting of imperial portraits, therefore, results in a confirmation of memory rather than its obliteration. The relationship between the old and the new portrait is not static, but constitutes a dynamic dialogue. It is appropriately two-sided: Caligula's transformation into Augustus, for instance, can be viewed as a change for the better, while a Tacitean viewer would appreciate the profiling of Augustus as Caligula's progenitor. Moreover, although portraits were re- cut, the rest of the statue remained the same, thereby rein- forcing the earlier identity. Given the rehabilitation of several dishonored rulers, the frequency of resculpting in the private and public realms in general, and Roman familiarity with se- mantically dichotomous portraits of statesmen such as Pompey, it is not surprising that damnatio memoriae by the fourth cen- tury leads to translatio memoriae. The same process ofrecutting now is used to transform a positive ruler into another positive one (cf. Arch of Constantine). All this suggests that the stigma attached to the earlier negative examples was limited. A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS? THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE GENDER OF TIME IN THE ROMAN WORLD: Melissa Barden Dowling, Southern Meth- odist University The first discrete personification of abstract time, Aeternitas, appeared in Roman art of the first century A.D., initially as a female image represented on official coins and monuments. But in A.D. 121, a new male image of time appeared in impe- rial, state sponsored art, and simultaneously, Roman personifi- cations of the Seasons appeared in male as well as female form. Throughout the second century, the iconography of time remained remarkably fluid, illustrated by both male and fe- male types. Three trends in Roman society (the increasing centralization of time keeping, the creation of elaborate be- liefs in the afterlife, and transformations in Romans' expecta- tions of life through changes in the conception of virtus) explain these changes and suggest a profound reenvisioning of the nature of time in Western thought. IMAGING WOMEN ON THE COLUMN OF MARCUS: Sheila Dillon, Duke University While most studies of Marcus's Column have been con- cerned with the sculptural style of the frieze, I focus in this paper on a mostly neglected aspect of the frieze's historical narrative: the representation of women in the wars. This pa- per considers the roles these non-Roman women played in the imperial history constructed by the frieze, and explores the following questions. What part does a woman's age, ethnicity, and social status play in how she is represented? Why do these women invariably appear in scenes of extreme violence, in which they are separated from their children, taken prisoner, physically assaulted, or even killed, while the women pictured on Trajan's Column peacefully attend sacri- fices, greet the emperor, or flee the fighting without harm? Why were such scenes considered relevant and meaningful to the war's narrative? What does their inclusion suggest about the history this monument was striving to construct? Rather</page><page sequence="42">272 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 than representing "a more insecure army" or "a more pro- foundly pathetic spirit akin to the melancholy of the 'Medita- tions'," I argue that the scenes on Marcus's column were meant to show that the emperor and his army were supremely ca- pable of crushing the barbarian invaders even into the next generation, thus the prominence of the violence done to barbarian women and children. Such images would have reas- sured the Roman audience that the imperial ideology of clem- ency, humanity, and elegant civilian culture as expressed, for example, in the elegantly styled portraits of the Antonine emperors, did not extend to the battlefield. SESSION 3E: COLLOQUIUM: THE MYCE- NAEAN FEAST: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLOQUIUM THE PREPARATION, EQUIPMENT, AND RITUALS OF THE MYCENAEAN FEAST: James C. Wright, Bryn Mawr College Information about feasting in the Mycenaean world is de- rived from frescoes, seals, scenes on decorated pottery, asso- ciations of pottery and metal and stone vessels in tombs and in settlement contexts, and the Linear B tablets. In this paper I examine these sources from the Minoan through the Mycenaean periods and present an outline of the history of the Mycenaean feast. I explore the origins of feasting tradi- tions in the Middle Helladic period and the adaptation by the Mycenaeans of the highly developed rituals of the feast in the courts of the Minoan palaces and villas. I then consider the general nature of feasting in the Mycenaean palaces and show how it includes hunting and sacrifice, the transportation of equipment, the preparation of food, and the celebration of the feast. I conclude with observations about the evolution of the feast as a social phenomenon. ANIMAL SACRIFICE, ARCHIVES, AND FEASTING AT THE PALACE OF NESTOR:Jack L. Davis and Sharon R. Stocker, University of Cincinnati In 1998 and 2000 study for final publication of animal bones from the Palace of Nestor at Pylos was initiated by Paul Halstead and Valasia Isaakidou of Sheffield University. The authors of this paper are providing information concerning the context of those faunal assemblages preserved by Blegen's team, draw- ing it from primary archives and from reexamination of associ- ated, but unpublished finds. Of special interest is a large de- posit of animal bones found heaped in the corner of the so- called annex to the Archives Room of the Palace (room 7). The assemblage consisted of thigh bones from 11 cattle, from all of which meat had been scraped before they were inten- tionally burnt. It is clear that the bones were not burned accidentally in the destruction of the Palace. Nearby Blegen found 11 miniature kylikes, a bronze sword, and a bronze knife. In another part of the room had stood a large storage jar or pithos. This deposit seems to provide clear evidence for burnt animal sacrifice at the end of the 13th century B.C. In this paper we discuss the implications of these discoveries for Mycenaean ritual practice and the implications that they raise concerning the relationship between sacrifice and feasting in Late Bronze Age Greece, since the slaughter of this many cattle on a single occasion would have provided sufficient meat to feed hundreds of individuals. HIERARCHY, EXCLUSION, ASPIRATION, AND SOCIAL MANIPULATION IN MYCENAEAN BANQUETING: Lisa M. Bendall, Cambridge University Linear B documentation relating to state-organized ban- quets includes lists of foodstuffs contributed by social elites for major feasts, provisions by the palaces to regional centers for local feasting, and-more surprising-by lower-ranking mem- bers of society (e.g., craftsmen) to the palaces. Donations of this type may have worked to enhance personal prestige through demonstrations of piety and wealth, but a model of "reciprocal gift-giving" is difficult to invoke in the latter two cases because of the very great differences in wealth and social status of the participants. The contributions may be linked to a "banqueting hierar- chy" observed at Pylos, Nichoria, and Malthi. At the palace, Cts. 63 and 88 are known to be banqueting areas, served with fineware from nearby pantries. Ct. 58 is proposed as another banqueting area, served with inferior pottery from Rm. 60. Finally, a paucity of drinking vessels in the megaron is ex- plained by noting that the room has the major concentra- tion of metal drinking vessels. The quality of wares in each area can be linked to degrees of control of access, suggesting a gradation of social status for the participants. A lower level of the hierarchy is seen at Nichoria and Malthi, with local imitation of palatial installations and wares. The situation may be not so much one of reciprocity, but of patronage and social insecurity. Banqueting was apparently a standard fea- ture of Mycenaean religious life, but participation at the various levels marked one's place in the hierarchy and af- firmed one's status. LATE MYCENAEAN FEASTING ON TSOUNGIZA AT AN- CIENT NEMEA: Mary K. Dabney, Bryn Mawr Col- lege, Paul Halstead, Sheffield University, U.K., and Patrick Thomas, University of Evansville Excavations from 1984 to 1986 of the prehistoric settle- ment on Tsoungiza at Ancient Nemea by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project uncovered several large deposits of Late Mycenaean date. One in Excavation Unit 9 on the eastern slope of the settlement of which the decorated pottery was predominantly solidly painted open shapes, primarily kylikes and stemmed bowls, is dated to the LH IIIA: 1-2 period. Mixed with the pottery were many distinctive types of anthropomor- phic and zoomorphic ceramic figurines and the lower two- thirds of a large ceramic female figure. The figure with a re- stored height of 45 cm is similar to those found in the sanctu- aries at Phylakopi and Mycenae. Also in the deposit were ani- mal bones, almost exclusively from the heads and feet (legs) of cattle, which we interpret as discard from primary butcher- ing. The contents of this deposit distinguish it from other deposits of household refuse at Tsoungiza. This deposit ap- pears to be refuse from a ceremonial activity that included feasting. The authors are examining the significance of this deposit in the context of the growth of nearby Mycenae and the social and economic relationship of Mycenae to outlying settlements such as Tsoungiza.</page><page sequence="43">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 273 NATIVE TRADITIONS OF DRINKING AT PHAISTOS DURING THE MYCENAEAN PERIOD: Elisabetta Borgna, University of Udine, Italy Some evidence of consumption at LM IIIC Phaistos sheds light on several aspects of drinking and eating activities on different ceremonial occasions in Late Bronze Age Crete. The investigation of both the archaeological contexts and the func- tion of the pottery style establishes that conspicuous consump- tion offood and drink constituted powerful social and ideologi- cal instruments to negotiate social identity, legitimize author- ity, and, possibly, create political hierarchy. In Postpalatial times traditional social control practices such as festivals and ban- quets became a dynamic means of political competition. The transition from the palaces to postpalatial settlements im- plies that participation in drinking ceremonies was less ex- clusive and prompted by a much more intense social interac- tion, as elaborate pottery styles suggest. Meanwhile the evi- dence of Phaistos apparently indicates that different types of banquets were possibly related to separate spheres of social exchange, dependent on different social roles and political implications. In the context of Minoan-Mycenaean accul- turation in LM III Crete, in which the adoption of the Main- land component was possible due to the ideological strate- gies of the local elites, on the one hand drinking activities seem to have been strongly influenced by the Mycenaean tradition, especially as regards symbolic display and pottery style, on the other hand they were well rooted in traditional Minoan practices. This paper aims at identifying the native Cretan compo- nents by considering evidence of ritual consumption in such different spheres as funerary rituals, aristocratic dwellings, and cult practices, in order to distinguish similarities with and differences from the Mycenaean banqueting traditions. CYPRIOT DRINKING TRADITIONS AND THE ADAP- TATION OF MYCENAEAN DRINKING RITUAL: Louise Steel, University of Wales, Lampeter This paper will examine how Mycenaean drinking equip- ment-specifically chariot kraters, but also a variety of cups, kylikes, and serving vessels-were incorporated within tradi- tional Cypriot practices of consumption during the 15th, 14th, and 13th centuries B.C., and the ultimate impact of these changing social practices. The basic premise is that since the beginning of the Early Bronze Age on Cyprus, ceremonial drinking and group feast- ing had formed an important element of Cypriot society un- derpinning group cohesion. For the most part this can be inferred from the emphasis on certain novel ceramic shapes within the Cypriot funerary repertoire, in particular those that are imitative of metallic forms and those with exagger- ated spouts. By the early second millennium exotic drinking sets with international connotations-made in the Bichrome ware and widely disseminated around the coastal Near East- were being used. With reference to the ceramic record, and representa- tions where available, this paper will examine the incorpora- tion of Mycenaean drinking equipment into these highly developed ceremonies. Specifically it will address to what extent socioeconomic changes during the Late Bronze Age, in particular the emergence of urban communities, affected ceremonial practices necessitating the adoption of new, more exclusive equipment. Likewise, it will assess whether the geographic, economic, and cultural affinities of Cyprus and the kingdom of Ugarit will have influenced the choice of ceremonial equipment. SESSION 3F: WORKSHOP: COMBATING PSEUDOARCHAEOLOGY The phenomenon ofpseudoarchaeology--reconstructions of ancient history adhering to pseudoscientific standards of argument-is gaining in popularity. Books promoting Atlantis or its variants, numerological interpretations of ancient monu- ments, extraterrestrial intervention in human antiquity, reviv- als of "ancient wisdom," and the like sell in the millions, and pseudoarchaeologists are a frequent feature of television and other mass media presentations to the public. It is the purpose of this workshop to discuss the phenomenon and to examine various means the profession can employ to combat it. Ques- tions addressed include: What distinguishes archaeology from pseudoarchaeology? Should professional archaeologists even address the claims of pseudoarchaeologists or should they ig- nore them? Is it an abrogation of professional responsibility to let invalid claims gain wide acceptance with the public? Or does addressing pseudoclaims lend them a legitimacy they otherwise would lack? In confronting invalid claims, what meth- ods work best for the professional archaeologists in the class- room and with a wider audience? How can the profession better tackle the widespread misconceptions about its nature and methods so readily played upon by pseudohistorians and pseudoarchaeologists? How can professionals get their mes- sage across in the mass media, if at all? Panel: Garrett G. Fagan and Donald Redford, Penn State Uni- versity; Nicholas Flemming, Director, European Global Ocean Observing System, Southampton Oceanography Centre; Ken Feder, Central Connecticut State University; Chris Hale, BBC writer/producer and author SESSION 3G: WORKSHOP: ETRUSCANS IN THE MUSEUM In the fall of 2002, the University of Pennsylvania Museum will inaugurate its newly reinstalled Etruscan gallery, and, in anticipation, we propose to organize a workshop that will bring together a group of Etruscan scholars to consider the particu- lar issues and problems associated with the study of Etruscan material in museum collections. The leading scholars of Etruscan archaeology in the United States have agreed to join us in the workshop. Each partici- pant will present an aspect of his or her own research that is connected to the Museum,'s collection but also addresses broader issues related to working with Etruscan or Italic mate- rial in museum "contexts." Thus, while the workshop will use the Museum's collection as its starting point, it will also pro- vide a forum for the exchange of ideas and information re- lated to more general issues, such as authentication, conserva- tion, display, and the use of archival documentation. The workshop topicswill include: (1) Etruscan mirrors; (2) history of the Museum's Etruscan collection; (3) Faliscan pot- tery; (4) Etruscan iconography; (5) forgeries and authentica- tion; (6) conservation of Etruscan objects; (7) interpretation</page><page sequence="44">274 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 of remains in Etruscan urns in the Museum's collection, with reference to a study by Marshall Becker; (8) Etrusco-Geomet- ric pottery; (9) a dubious Chiusine tomb group; and (10) archi- tectural terracottas.

This means telling ar- chaeological stories that people find compelling and memo- rable. Those scholars who do this successfully provide an incal- culable service to the profession. In this workshop, bothjour- nalists and academics will offer tips on engaging the media, which pitfalls to avoid, and which opportunities to embrace.

Nejat Bilgen, Anadolu Uni- versity, Turkey The cemetery of Qavlum village is in the plain of Alpu, 16 km away from the center of Eski?ehir, Turkey. Archaeological salvage excavations were conducted in 1999 and 2000. In these two years, 46 graves were excavated. Of the 46 graves, 44 are pithos graves and 2 are plain inhumed burials. In total, 59 human skeletons were discovered. For the burial types, 27 graves were single and 14 graves double, and in 1 grave four people were buried together. The finds from the tombs proved to be varied. Bowls, bronze or copperjewelry, shell beads, and knucklebones were found inside and nearby the graves. Pots which displayed different typology were left both inside and outside of the pithoi. Two years of work have resulted in the unearthing of a rather important Early Hittite cemetery in the region of the Upper Sakarya Valley and the region of Eskigehir. The cemetery of Cavlum village has become an im- portant place in Anatolian archaeology on account of the quan- tity and quality of the material it contains from the Early Hittite period, when the custom of pithos burials was practiced as well. Although the contemporary settlement has not been found, it is considered that the (avlum village mound should be the connected settlement of the cemetery. Therefore, this cem- etery enables us to understand the cultural structure of this region in the Anatolian Middle Bronze Age. NEW PHRYGIAN ROCK-CUT CULT MONUMENTS FROM WESTERN PHRYGIA: Taciser Tiifekpi Sivas, Anadolu University, Turkey The Phrygians emerged as a powerful Iron Age kingdom of Anatolia in central Turkey in the eighth century B.C.E. This paper proposes to explore one aspect of the religious architec- ture of Phrygian civilization in the light of new surveys in western Phrygia. The evidence for Phrygian religious cult indicates that the major divinity was a goddess known to the Phrygians as Matar/ Mother Goddess. In western Phrygia, the prominence of Matar is demonstrated by a series of religious rock monuments. The monumental rock facades, the stepped altars, and the niches are the most original and impressive types of these monu- ments. The major concentration of these cult monuments lies in the highlands of Phrygia between the modern Turkish cities of Eskigehir, Afyonkarahisar, and Kiitahya. Our surveys have not only added a number of new open-air sanctuaries to the map, but also enriched the typology of the Phrygian cult monuments such as convex circular rock-cut forms and rectan- gular basins. The diameters of the convex circular forms vary between 0.9 m and 1.0 m and are outlined with channels. The rectan- gular basins are composed of two basins connected by round holes and rectangular or oval small niches at the back wall of the first basins. The upper basins lie about 0.5 m higher than the lower ones. The functions and the meanings of these recently found rock monuments are less clear than the other cult monu- ments such as facades and altars. But in my opinion similar functions could be proposed for these monuments, as for the other cult monuments, as open-air shrines. ROCK-CUT SACRED AREAS AT EPHESOS IN THE LIGHT OF NEW SURVEYS: FeriStah Soykal, Anadolu University, Turkey In Anatolia, first the Hittites and Urartians carved the rocks for cultic purposes, then the Phrygians' skill in rockcarving, inherited from the Bronze Age, enabled them to carve im- pressive monumental cult monuments for the great Mother Goddess/Matar Kubileya. Certainly, the Phrygians were the mediators in the transporting of this tradition to Ionia, and Ephesos, with its three open-air rock-cut sacred areas and one rock-cut shrine, represents one of the most important settle- ments where this tradition survived. These sacred areas are: 1. Open-air rock-cut spring sacred area on Mt. Pion (Pana- ylrdagi). This sacred area consists of niches, rock reliefs, and stepped altars, and is dedicated to Meter, Zeus Patroios, and Apollo. 2. Open-air rock-cut sacred area on Mt. Koressos (Billbfildagil). It consists of one rock throne and the steps leading to the throne. In the literature it is known as dedicated to Zeus, but it could be dedicated to Meter at the same time. 3. In 1999 in the course of our surveys we discovered a second rock-cut sacred area on Mt. Koressos. It consists of small rock niches, a cave, and rock-cut steps leading to this area. 4. "Felsspalt Tempel" is situated just in the north of Olympieion. Its foundation is completely hewn out of bedrock. It could be dedicated to Leto.</page><page sequence="45">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 275 As in the old Anatolian tradition, the Ephesians also dedi- cated the rocks to the Mother Goddess, and this reveals that the rooted Anatolian tradition continued to survive in Ionia for a long time. EARLY PHRYGIAN DRAWINGS AT GORDION AND THE CREATION OF A PHRYGIAN VISUAL IDENTITY: Lynn E. Roller, University of California, Davis A series of drawings from late eighth-century B.C. Gordion offers insight into attempts to establish a distinctive visual identity in the early Phrygian polity. The drawings, incised onto individual stone blocks that were later incorporated into building material, include human and animal figures and ab- stract signs. While initially thought to be random sketches, a close analysis reveals that many of the drawings were done by skilled artists familiar with Neo-Hittite sculptural style. The subject matter reveals an intriguing combination of Neo-Hittite (lions, warriors, hieroglyphic signs) and Phrygian (architec- ture, predatory birds) themes. Some may have been training exercises for local artists or preliminary sketches for a larger sculptural program, a point which suggests that the artists may have been preparing a complex sculptural narrative. But what would have been the purpose of such a narrative? The answer may lie in the changing political role of Phrygia in central Anatolia during the early Iron Age. As the Phrygians gained power to become the dominant people on the Anatolian plateau, they were faced with the need to establish a distinc- tive visual identity. Yet the Phrygians, immigrants from south- eastern Europe, had no tradition of monumental art compa- rable to contemporary sculptural programs of the Neo-Hittites and Assyrians. The Gordion drawings suggest that the Phrygians were on the verge of creating such a program. Al- though the project was abandoned, these preliminary draw- ings survive as a witness to a visual program that would have helped advertise the Phrygians as an important power on the Anatolian plateau. THE THRONE OF MIDAS?: Keith DeVries, University of Pennsylvania Museum A now well-known ivory statuette of a lion tamer was found in 1939 at Delphi in one of two adjacent pits filled with dis- carded votive material (some burned), of which the latest piece dates to ca. 420 B.C. The pits lay about 10 m west of the Treasury of the Corinthians. The statuette, which cuttings show to have been a furniture attachment, has usually been taken to be an Orientalizing east Greek work (with particu- larly strong Anatolian affinities). Demargne (1964), however, thought it was either east Greek or Lydian; Amandry (1991), the excavator of the deposits, declared himself convinced that it was made in Asia Minor but uncertain whether it was Greek or non-Greek; Schiering (1975) argued that it was Lydian or Phrygian. Recent finds near Elmali and progress in the research and publication of older excavated material, especially at Gordion, now allow a confident identification of the statuette as indeed non-Greek Anatolian, with a strong probability of being spe- cifically Phrygian. A date of the late eighth to seventh centu- ries is likely. The intriguing possibility thus arises that the statuette was part of the throne that Herodotos saw at Delphi in the Corinthian Treasury and termed a gift from the Phrygian king Midas, whom Assyrian records from 717 to 709 B.C. show to have been in power during at least that span of years. It is not mentioned in any text later than Herodotos, and by the time of Plutarch the building clearly no longer contained it. MORTUARY EVIDENCE FOR A POSSIBLE LATE SARMATIAN PRESENCE AT GORDION, TURKEY: Andrew L. Goldman, University of Pennsylvania Mortuary patterns within rural cemeteries have received little attention in Turkey, where research remains largely fo- cused upon urban necropoleis and their monumental funerary architecture. In central Anatolia, where the majority of the Roman period population once lived in a rural environment, town cemeteries represent an invaluable and hitherto unexploited resource for examining complex phenomena such as cultural diffusion in the Galatian hinterlands. The investi- gation of such cemeteries is urgently needed, since unchecked spoliation and increased agricultural activity are rapidly dimin- ishing their numbers. Excavations in the Common Cemetery at Gordion during the 1950s and early 1960s produced evidence for one such town cemetery, a cluster of 51 inhumation burials grouped closely together and dating between the second and fourth centuries A.D. Burial offerings include a wide range of goods, and six separate categories of construction technique may be differentiated among the single and double interments. Two distinct types of burials-deep-shafted graves with either stepped ledges for a lower cover or an off-set "catacomb" cham- ber at the bottom-have origins that can be traced explicitly to the Northern Pontic region and Late Sarmatian culture. Certain parallels are also apparent in the posture of the de- ceased, the graves' northward orientation, and the inventory of the grave goods. It is suggested here that direct cultural contact may be responsible for such phenomena. One pos- sible explanation, based upon the presence of hob-nailed boots and rings with intaglios bearing martial themes, is that military veterans of Sarmatian origin were settled at Gordion during the Late Roman period. SESSION 4B: AEGEAN SCRIPTS AND AR- CHIVES A LINEAR A-INSCRIBED BRONZE CAULDRON FROM MYCENAE SHAFT GRAVE IV AND HEIRLOOMS OF A CRETAN BRONZE ARTIST IN THE LATE MYCENAEAN PALATIAL PERIOD: Thomas G. Palaima, University of Texas at Austin An inscribed sign on the handle of a Cretan bronze caul- dron from the Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae fits into the enlarg- ing picture of Linear A outside of Crete and has implications for the structure of the Linear A syllabary and for elite artistic connoisseurship in the late Mycenaean Palatial period. The inscribed sign (discovered in cleaning in 1962) was omitted from the definitive Linear A corpus and the standard transcription volume because it was a singleton and difficult to identify. It occurs on Matthaius Nr. 24 = Karo N. 576. I argue that the sign is most probably a version of the Linear A sign corresponding to Linear B * 43 (phonetic value ai). It is known</page><page sequence="46">276 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 that Linear A had such signs designating vocalic and semi- vocalic elements of i, j, u, w. In the inventory of ritual vessels, elaborate furniture, and sacrificial implements for a major commensual ceremony in the Pylos Ta series, a long-standing interpretive problem has been the unusual identification of certain tripods as "of Cretan manufacture" "Aigeus. "One proposal is that Aigeus identifies the manufacturer. The ai on Matthius Nr. 24 likewise may identify the Shaft Grave cauldron as the product of Aigeus. The implications of the fact that an official at Pylos ca. 1200 B.C.E. could identify heirloom bronze vessels exceptionally as Cretan in origin and of a certain artist's style is worthy of discussion, whether or not the mark on Matthfius Nr. 24 is correctly identified as ai. THE CONTEXT AND CONTENT OF CYPRO-MINOAN TEXTS FROM KALAVASOS-A YIosDHIMITRIos: Joanna S. Smith, Columbia University Cypro-Minoan, the Late Bronze Age script of Cyprus, re- mains undeciphered. Neither are there enough inscriptions for a cryptographic solution, nor is there a bilingual text that might be used to translate Cypro-Minoan. An archaeological approach, however, makes it possible to understand not only the functional context of the texts, but also, in some cases, their probable contents. In 1998, Nicolle Hirschfeld and I presented a poster session on the Cypro-Minoan Corpus Project (abstract in AJA 103 [1999] 279) that detailed the archaeo- logical approach. Since that time we have each pursued spe- cific segments of the total corpus. In this poster session I present the complete results of my study of 13th century B.C. Cypro-Minoan inscriptions from Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, Cyprus. Of primary concern are five lengthy documents written pre-firing on small clay cylinders from Building X. They are the only set of similar Cypro-Minoan texts ever discovered in a single phase of use of one building on Cyprus. By comparison with Linear A, the accepted parent script for Cypro-Minoan, as well as the visual arrangement of contemporary texts written in Aegean and Near Eastern scripts, it has been possible to determine that the Kalavasos cylinders contain numerals and repeated signs, including ideograms. Palimpsest sections of the texts preserve traces of earlier records that were erased prior to reinscription. The find contexts, condition of the objects, text structures, and relationships among signs make it possible to determine the function of this group of lengthy Cypro-Minoan inscriptions: the Kalavasos cylinders contain economic records. BEER IN THE LINEAR B RECORDS?: Ruth Palmer, Ohio University Organic residue analyses on clayvessels presented in Minoans and Mycenaeans: Flavours of their Time (1999) indicated that a fermented grain beverage had been made in the Aegean possibly as early as EM IIB. Samples from LBA Khania and Rethymnon on Crete, and Thebes, and Mycenae on the main- land show fermented grains perhaps as part of a "cocktail" of wine, honey, and beer for ritual consumption. This Bronze Age evidence for beer in the Aegean is striking, because later Greek did not have an Aegean word for beer, even though grain-based Near Eastern civilizations made it a staple drink. What evidence might the Linear B records provide for beer or the mixed beverage? The most frequently recorded ideo- grams for liquid products are already identified aswine, olive oil, and honey. Only one other ideogram that appears numerous times remains unidentified: * 134, which in MY Go 610 is mea- sured in liquid subunits, and on five inscribed nodules is sent to Thebes along with animals for a feast. Or grains listed in mixed commodity tablets might be intended for beer-making. Unlike wine, beer can be brewed anytime from stored grain, but has a short storage life. The KN Fs series records periodic offerings of wine, olive oil, honey, grain, and flour sent to shrines; the honey and the grain could have been fermented at the shrine to make the "cocktail." The relative importance of beer versus wine in ritual must also be evaluated. "DECIPHERING" IMAGES: A SEMIOTIC APPROACH TO THE MYCENAEAN NODULES FROM PYLOS: Diamantis Panagiotopoulos, University of Heidel- berg, Germany Mycenaean nodules combine both script and iconography for transmitting information related to the administrative activ- ity of the palaces. Whereas the inscriptions can be read and evaluated, the seal impressions remain in a sense "undeciphered" due to their vague semiotic status. The present paper attempts to explore the rich potential of this "miniature iconography" as a means of deepening our understanding of Mycenaean ideol- ogy and administration. In semiotic terms, the seal impression fulfills a dual function. It serves as: (a) an "indexical" sign establishing the identity of the seal owner, and (b) an "iconic" sign affording symbolic information about its person or status. Especially the tension between "indexical" and "iconic" functions of the images can be indicative as to the identity of the seal users and to the factors determining the variety and choice of seal designs. The most striking feature of the Pylian seal impressions is that the ideological/"iconic" elements appear to have superseded the administrative/"indexical" ones. The seal designs were not cre- ated as transparent signifiers of personal identity but mainly as bearers of an ideological message concerning the status of the seal owner. Consequently, priority was given to the visual impact of the image rather than to its "legibility," i.e., the efficiency of immediate decoding. Relevant to the "iconic" qualities of the Pylian seal impres- sions is the recognition of two homogeneous groups among them: the first consists of elaborate seal designs displaying a "palatial" iconography, whereas the second includes poor qual- ity motifs featuring nonrepresentative "bucolic" themes. Sig- nificantly, all inscribed nodules belong to the first group. The present paper aims to demonstrate that this pattern is meaning- ful and corresponds to official rank and location of the seal owners. KINSHIP AND THE LATE HELLADIC POLITICAL ECONOMY: RE-READING ADMINISTRATIVE DOCU- MENTS FROM PYLOS: Elizabeth M. Percival and Aaron D. Wolpert, University of Cincinnati Conventional readings of Linear B archives at Pylos recon- struct a central bureaucracy that imposed an administered economy on the Messenian hinterland. Nontextual evidence, however, supports other plausible interpretations. Research into conditions beyond Ano Englianos has demonstrated that authoritywas embedded in local communities participating in a decentered regional economy. Surface remains attest to spe-</page><page sequence="47">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 277 cialized industries not housed at the palace and not recorded in preserved archives; reassessment of the collection of agri- cultural staples indicates that the palace extracted "subsistence" support from the immediate vicinity and did not manage a more extensive redistributive system; and diachronic settle- ment patterns situate this scaled-down economic presence within a short-lived and hard-fought ascendancy for rulers at Ano Englianos. Such conditions suggest negotiated politics structured by traditional kinship logic, not an entrenched hegemony enforced through institutional coercion. Village heads delivered collected resources to the center in accor- dance with kinship and ritual obligations associated with wife- giving and wife-taking, marital relations that enhanced politi- cal legitimacy for these local chiefs and the paramount lin- eage. It is clear nonetheless that this alternative reconstruc- tion is not consonant with the painstaking archival recordkeeping associated with the palace. In this paper we reconcile this contradiction, arguing that a political economy governed by kinship principles was differently represented at the centerin depersonalized terms that effected separation from a peripheral substratum of local aristocrats. Conflicting repre- sentations reflect a constant tension in center-periphery re- lations that is legible in the textual record-in toponyms, "districts," and standardized accounting that mask a parallel reality of personal obligation. SESSION 4C: GREEK ARCHITECTURE THE TELESTERION AT ELEUSIS AND ITS POSITION IN GREEK ARCHITECTURAL TRADITION: Crispin Corrado Goulet, Brown University The building at Eleusis known as the Telesterion was unique within Greek sanctuary architecture. A square, roofed structure with provisions for the containment of a large crowd, the hall was unparalleled in buildings of purely religious function during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Yet investigation has shown that while the Telesterion was undoubtedly singular, certain of its unique aspects tied it to established features within sanctuar- ies, giving it historical tradition as far back as the Geometric period. The unique form, however, was not one to be subse- quently adopted in the religious sphere. Due to its tremendous capacity for accommodating crowds, it instead became popular in civic architecture. Indeed the Telesterion at Eleusis was prob- ably the single influence for a new type of public building that quickly gained popularity in Athens, and soon, all of Greece. This paper explores the archaeological data from sites that pre- and postdate the Telesterion. I argue that the features that in fact made the Telesterion such a distinct structure, the stepped theatral area as well as the square enclosed design, came to- gether in a form of architecture which uniquely linked an early tradition of sanctuary features with a future class of civic assem- bly buildings. Indeed the Telesterion may have been the chro- nologicaljoin between the two. As Kerenyi said, "Within Greek religion, the Eleusinian Mysteries were unique of their kind." So, too, the architecture. TELESTERION OR TELESTERIA?: Elizabeth Kosmetatou, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium This paper aims at examining the validity of the occasional identification ofancientbuildings by some modern scholars as telesteria (Halls of Mysteries). To date, there has been little discussion of this term as it relates to the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, but it has found its way into the secondary literature in reference to structures that have been associated, justifiably or not, with the cult of fertility deities and the initiation into their mysteries. Upon examining the limited bibliography on presumed Halls of Mysteries, it becomes evident that these are sometimes believed to belong to a distinct architectural type, a variation of the Hypostyle Hall, with a rectangular, often squarish, plan; rows of seats along the sides of two of its interior walls; and a "forest of columns" to support its roof. A review of all buildings that were identified in modern times as telesteria follows. Evidence from the Telesterion of Eleusis; the Kabireion of Samothrace; buildings from the sanc- tuary of Aphrodite Erykine in Gortynia, the Argive Heraion, Sangri (Naxos), and the Lemnian Kabireion; as well as from surviving hypostyle halls, suggests that the arbitrary identifica- tion of structures as "telesteria" cannot stand to scrutiny. The term itself was never used in antiquity to describe a generic architectural type, but was rather used to refer to the process of initiation. Furthermore, the archaeological data suggest that no specific form was ever developed for mystery halls. ARCHAIC AND CLASSICAL PREDECESSORS TO HELLE- NISTIC MONUMENTAL STEPS: Mary B. Hollinshead, University of Rhode Island Changes that take place in Hellenistic architecture make it look dramatically different from that of earlier eras. Multilevel complexes, such as the sanctuary ofAthena at Lindos on Rhodes or the sanctuary of Asklepios on Kos suggest new concepts at work, despite the conservative nature of the Greek architec- tural tradition. Their broad staircases epitomize the topographi- cal linking and conspicuous display of the Hellenistic period. Yet much of what looks new is a recombination of existing components such as temples, terraces, and stoas, albeit with important alterations in placement and scale. I would add monumental steps to the list of formal elements that were already well-established in Archaic and Classical Greece. Early examples of broad steps at sites around the Aegean basin serve as retaining walls, grandstands, and routes of access. Several (e.g., Perachora, Argos, Thasos) serve more than one func- tion, reflecting an adaptability of form not always acknowl- edged in Greek architecture. Such overlaps in function also embody an intriguing conflict in iconography--of individual ascent versus communal viewing. Evidence of early steps at Lindos, the Argive Heraion, and Corinth demonstrates that the Greeks were not only adapting to but also exploiting ir- regular terrain by building monumental staircases as early as the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. My study of Archaic and Classical broad steps aims to assess their various uses and mean- ing in context, and to establish this architectural element in the repertoire of pre-Hellenistic architecture. CLASSICAL AND MEDIEVAL FORTIFICATIONS ON MT. ONEION IN THE KORINTHIA: William R. Caraher and Timothy E. Gregory, Ohio State University Mt. Oneion forms a nearly solid barrier to north-south communications in the eastern part of the Korinthia. In 1971 Ronald Stroud called attention to a fortification and tower on the easternmost pinnacle of Oneion, at Stanotopi, overlook- ing the harbor at Kenchreai and the probable course of a coastal road running north-south. During the summer of 2000</page><page sequence="48">278 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey explored further to the west. This revealed a much more extensive series of fortifications and clarified our understanding of the passes across Mt. Oneion and the relationship between Korinth and its hinterland. Among the discoveries on the ridge of the Oneion summit was a large fortified circuit built in rough, dry masonry, with many obvious outlying walls. The dense ceramic scatter, clearly associated with the upper fortification, dates almost exclusively to the Late Classical period. The rough construction and narrow chronological range of ceramic evidence fit well with J. McCredie's criteria for forti- fied camps, and this helps to explain its purpose. This camp, best accessed from south of Oneion, protected passes that led to the area around modern Athikia (and ancient Tenea?), bypassing the regular route along the Xeropotamos River. Clearly, the fortification system on Mt. Oneion served to pro- tect the wealthy area south of the mountain which must have been especially important to Korinth. Not far from the Late Classical fortification was a defensive wall dating apparently from the Venetian era and showing that the pass through Oneion remained important into late times. AN AUGUSTAN TRIBUNAL: A SEAT FOR GALLIO: Paul D. Scotton, University of Washington Investigations in the Julian Basilica in Ancient Corinth dur- ing July and August 2000 have led to the recognition of key elements of the Augustan or first phase of construction of the building. I have argued previously, both at this forum and in print, that theJulian Basilica was the site of the imperial court of law in Corinth. Elements of the later, Antonine tribunal, previ- ously identified, enabled a restoration of that facade on paper. The location of the tribunal of the Antonine phase in the south aisle and evidence of earlier attempts to shore up the main floor from below suggested that an earlier version of the tribunal stood in this same spot. Elements of that Augustan phase tribunal have now been identified. Most importantly, two wall crown blocks indicate the spacing of the support beams for the ceiling coffers and demonstrate that the Augustan tribunal conformed to the design module of the building, i.e., 10 Roman feet (RF) or 2.957 m. This tribunal was 10 x 30 RF, tetrastyle, Ionic, and originally of poros, stucco, and wood. Although the tribunal was later reveted in marble, its basic appearance did not change until the Antonine remodel- ing of the basilica. Thus, a restoration can be offered not only of the Augustan tribunal but also of the one upon which Gallio sat and before which the apostle Paul was brought. SESSION 4D: RECENT RESEARCH ON THE PREHISTORIC GREEK MAINLAND THE BEGINNING OF THE BRONZE AGE ON THE GREEK MAINLAND: John E. Coleman, Cornell University The Early Bronze Age probably began on the Greek main- land in the later fourth millennium B.C. (ca. 3200 B.C. accord- ing to many scholars). The details are obscure, despite the recent appearance of reports on excavations at sites occupied in the Chalcolithic (or "Final Neolithic") period and the EBA, such as Pevkakia nearVolos. Radiocarbon dates are scarce and the few sites occupied in both the Chalcolithic and the EBA show no clear signs of a continuous cultural transition. A gap in occupation of some 600 years has even been posited between the two chronological periods (J.E. Coleman, "An Archaeo- logical Scenario for the 'Coming of the Greeks' ca. 3200 B.C.," JIES 28 [2000] 101-53). I identify three central Greeksites, Petromagoula and Pyrasos near Volos, and Doliana near Ioannina, as likely to have pro- duced some of the earliest EBA material yet attested. The rel- evant finds from Petromagoula and Doliana include distinctive incised pottery (dubbed "Bratislava type" byJ. Maran) with close Balkan parallels during the Baden period. Although the mate- rial from Doliana was regarded as Chalcolithic by its excavator, I argue that it is better placed in the EBA. Doliana is dated by a series of radiocarbon determinations, not yet published in de- tail, to 3600-3200 B.C. The finds from these three sites have few connections with the preceding Chalcolithic cultures of Greece and, taken together with evidence from Sitagroi and Dikili Tash in Macedonia, may suggest that Early Bronze Age peoples moved into the Greek peninsula from the north. BRONZE AGE MITROU IN EAST LOKRIS, GREECE: Margaretha Kramer-Hajos, Cornell University The unexcavated Bronze Age site of Mitrou is an islet/prom- ontory located in the bay of Atalanti. Investigations by the Cornell Halai and East Lokris project began in 1988-1989 with surface and subsurface surveys. In 2000 and 2001 the finds collected from the surface were extensively studied in prepara- tion for publication by Margaretha Kramer-Haj6s (pottery) and Kerill O'Neill (lithics, figurines, etc.). Our researches show that Mitrou was extensively settled throughout the Bronze Age with occupation continuing into the Early Iron Age, after which there was little human activity. Magnetometer survey in 1988- 1989 indicated the possible location of a fortification wall at the neck of the promontory. Artifacts from the surface of Mitrou range almost exclusively from Early Helladic to Geometric date. Theyinclude obsidian cores and various stone tools, Mycenaean anthropomorphic and theriomorphic figurines, and high-qual- ity Mycenaean pottery. Examination ofvertical scarps produced by erosion from the sea showed that beneath the Mycenaean levels are from two to at least four meters of Middle Helladic and Early Helladic deposits. We recorded eight cist tombs, some of carefully cut stone, and counted many more, all probably of Middle Helladic date. Mitrou was probably the biggest (ca. 3.6 ha) and most important center in East Lokris for much of the Bronze Age and may have served as a port for Orchomenos. Late Helladic chamber tombs recovered by the Greek Archaeological Ser- vice at nearby Tragana may represent a cemetery of the Mycenaean settlement. PATTERNS IN THE LATER PREHISTORY OF THE EAST- ERN KORINTHIA: DanielJ. Pullen, Florida State University, Thomas F Tartaron, Yale University, Richard M. Rothaus, St. Cloud State University, and Dimitri Nakassis and Amy Dill, University of Texas at Austin. From 1999 to 2001, the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS) obtained a wealth of new data on later prehis- toric settlement in its 200 km2 study area. EKAS sampled di- verse environmental zones in the lowlands of the northern Korinthian plain, the Saronic and Korinthian Gulf coasts, and the rugged inland terrain south of Mount Oneion. Predictive models for prehistoric settlement and harbor locations were de-</page><page sequence="49">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 279 veloped and tested, and numerous sites and off-site scatters of prehistoric material were systematically investigated. As a result, we are able to measure intraregional variability in habitation and exploitation of land and other resources, and to address complex questions involving the regional system and its interrelated parts. We may also begin to place the eastern Korinthia within the wider context of other regional projects carried out in neighbor- ing regions, including the Nemea Valley, the Berbati Valley, and the southern Argolid. Itis already clear that the eastern Korinthia's Neolithic and Bronze Age trajectory is unique in its particular chronological development and social and economic dynamics. Thus, the EKAS results contribute to the broader picture of chro- nological and cultural variability that is emerging from similar studies in the northeastern Peloponnese and beyond. This paper examines the similarities and contrasts, and offers explanations for them. THE THIRD SEASON OF EXCAVATIONS AT PLATAIAI, GREECE: AN ANALYSIS: Andreas L. Konecny, Aus- trian Institute of Archaeology, University of Vienna, and Ronald T. Marchese, University of Minnesota at Duluth Excavation and survey of ancient Plataiai continued in Sep- tember, 2001. Both yielded a substantial body of new informa- tion on the site. The Archaic and Classical fortification systems were thoroughly examined and linked to the broader issue of Athenian defensive strategy in the sixth to fourth centuries B.C. Excavations in the "lower town" at the western gateway- the main thoroughfare of the community, which determined the town's orthogonal schema--was clarified, especially those structures previously identified as domestic housing. On the "acropolis" Archaic and Geometric strata were consolidated, pro- viding a more substantive body of data on the early domestic habitation of the community. Further excavations yielded addi- tional information on Plataiai's Bronze Age levels, especially the substantial fortification enclosure identified in 2000 that dates to the LH III period. This was superimposed over earlier habitation in the EH and MH periods, suggesting the relative importance of the community throughout the Bronze Age. Although Protogeometric, Geometric, Archaic, early to late Clas- sical, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and metabyzantine ce- ramics are in abundance on the acropolis, excavations in 2001 concentrated on the prehistoric habitation of the site. This yielded material that postdated the Classical period by millennia with the earliest occupational deposits of Late Neolithic date. Preliminary analysis has confirmed a substantial habitation pe- riod for Plataiai covering five millennia of near continuous occu- pation at the site proper-far beyond the meager remains and history suggested by current scholarship. SESSION 4E: COLLOQUIUM: DECONSTRUC- TING AND RECONSTRUCTING ALBANIAN ARCHAEOLOGY AN OVERVIEW OF ALBANIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL THOUGHT AND ITS SOCIAL CONTEXT: Lorenc Bejko, Albanian Rescue Archaeology Unit, Tirana This paper identifies the most important components in Albanian archaeological thought, presents a brief outline of Albanian archaeology as it exists today, and discusses possible reforms that might assist its development in the future. Five main components in Albanian archaeological thought are dis- cussed: archaeology's close links with history and historical rea- soning: Marxism as the ruling ideology in the country through- out the second half of the 20th century; nationalism and ethnogenesis, and their development in the Balkans; empiri- cism; and cultural history. Three main points about Albanian archaeology need to be kept in mind: Albanian archaeology is a relatively new discipline that came into existence a mere 50 years ago, was modeled on other European schools, and was influenced by foreign intel- lectual achievements. Archaeology in Albania was, however, an Albanian product that was determined by the social, political, and historical context of the country at that time when it devel- oped. Consequently, changes in the cultural context in Albania might also be expected to have an impact on the archaeological system (theoretical, administrative, educational, and informa- tive). Among recent developments are noted the current theo- retical confusion in Albanian archaeology, which reflects to some degree social conditions in Albania, and insecurity about future developments in the discipline. However, close contacts with archaeological institutions in other countries, changes within the discipline outside of Albania, and a growing con- sciousness of the need for some substantive reforms within the Albanian system offer hope for the creation of a stronger, more integrated archaeology in the future. THE MYTHS OF AENEAS: ARCHAEOLOGY, POLITICS, AND IDENTITY IN INTER-WAR ALBANIA: OliverJ. Gilkes, University of East Anglia, U.K. Between 1924 and 1943 the Italian government sponsored an archaeological mission in Albania. Its purpose was overtly po- litical, to counteract foreign influence with a cultural initiative that would facilitate Italian penetration of the country. Simulta- neously it was intended that the research objectives would pro- vide data to support the fascist myths being developed as part of Mussolini's revolution. The young Italian archaeologist who was head of the mission, Luigi Maria Ugolini, was specifically directed to focus his research in areas that would further the underlying political agenda. Fur- thermore, he was encouraged to develop the publications and publicity arising from the mission in tune with the changing requirements ofRome. This paper will examine the mission from the point ofview of its public persona, its publicity, and published research. Firstly, it will focus on the way in which the Italians adopted a preexisting notion of Albanian identity and then manipulated it via the archaeological research to their own ends. Relevant here will be the conflict between the nationalist-political objectives and Ugolini's own personnel research agenda. Secondly, the pub- lished output of the mission and its associated publicity ephemera will be examined with a view to determining exactly how success- ful the archaeologists and their political masters were in molding public opinion. Finally, consideration will be given to the results of the Italian Archaeological Mission and the ways in which they predetermined future research directions inAlbania. THE CONSTRUCTION OF IDENTITIES IN POST- ROMAN ALBANIA: William Bowden, University of East Anglia, U.K. During the communist period Albania's archaeologists de- voted considerable time to the study of the seventh to ninth</page><page sequence="50">280 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 centuries A.D. This was envisaged as the period when the popu- lation of the area now covered byAlbania reclaimed their Illyrian heritage as part of an Illyrian-Albanian identity. This was crucial in the communist model ofAlbanian history, which envisaged a direct cultural and ethnic continuity between the ancient Illyrian and modemrn Albanian populations. Many archaeologists, both in Albania and elsewhere, have subsequently rejected this model for its nationalistic and ethno- centric connotations. However, the wealth of evidence relat- ing to this period indicates significant changes in the ways in which the inhabitants of the region constructed new social identities in the changing political and economic climate of the Balkans following the loss of Roman control in the early sev- enth century. The archaeological material includes large quan- tities of grave finds as well as finds from hilltop settlement sites. This paper will examine some of the ways in which this mate- rial can be approached, particularly in regard to the questions of ethnic identity that have previously dominated archaeology in Albania. Recent work on ethnicity in archaeology has adopted the perspective of anthropologists such as Frederic Barth who view ethnicity in terms of the choices of identity made in order to establish and maintain boundaries between different social units. This paper will attempt to determine the extent to which these choices can be identified in the archaeological record of post-Roman Albania. THE ORIGINS OF THE ALBANIANS AND THE EARLY MEDIEVAL KOMAN CIVILIZATION: Etleva Nallbani, Institute of Archaeology, Tirana All European nations, including the Albanian, have an iden- tity. Already by the end of the 19th century the great antiquity of the Albanians was stressed by both historians and politicians. This ideological viewpoint was succeeded before WWII by a more evolved perspective that emphasized the multiethnic nature of the Albanians. But the dictatorial regime of Hoxha again chose to emphasize the unique, autochthonous, and an- cient origins of the Albanians and their static national con- sciousness. It looked to archaeology more than any other his- toric discipline to prove the legitimacy of such ideas, and ar- chaeology developed empirical methods and models that proved invaluable in supporting this national "project." Such demagogi- cal archaeology had the power to deform methodology and to contort facts. It eliminated scientific objectivity in interpreta- tion and peopled the Albanian past with nationally unified soci- eties that were ready to fight for their territories, establishing groundwork for possible humanitarian disasters in the future. A dispassionate look at the archaeological evidence suggests, how- ever, that it may be interpreted in ways very different from those emphasized under communism. In particular I discuss archaeological evidence relating to the so-called Arber civiliza- tion of Late Antiquity and the early Medieval period. I will argue that elements of dress, weapons, andjewelry found in cemeter- ies of the so-called Koman culture of the sixth to eighth centu- ries A.D. point not only to the continuation of regional tradi- tions, but to cultural mixing and openness. MODELING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF AN ILLYRIAN TRIBAL SYSTEM: ETHNOGRAPHIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALOGUES: Michael L. Galaty, Millsaps College Anthropologists are currently redefining what is meant by the term "tribe," as first articulated by Elman Service in 1962. Are there characteristics specific to certain societies that might mark them as being "tribal"? If so, can a redefined model of tribalism be employed in Albania to explain the genesis of an Illyrian ethos? More specifically, can a tribal model be applied in southern Albania to help us to better understand the inter- action of Greek colonists and indigenous Illyrians, such as in the vicinity of Apollonia (as N.G.L. Hammond has implied)? In order to construct a tribal model of Illyrian-Greek interac- tions it is necessary to collect archaeological data that will validate the model. Such data are beginning to appear. Fur- thermore, if possible it would be useful to identify suitable analogues for tribal behavior as it might have evolved in a Greco-Albanian world. I will suggest two such possible ana- logues. First, a tribal sociopolitical system has functioned in northern Albania into the present day. This system, though poorly studied by modern anthropologists, was described in some detail by early 20th-century travelers to the region (e.g., Edith Durham, Rose Wilder Lane, Margaret Hasluck). Their descriptions can, I will argue, serve to enlighten and inform our study of the Illyrian tribes. Second, ethnohistoric accounts of the colonization by the English of what is now Virginia may serve as an example of tribal responses to an intruding culture, analogous to the Greek colonization of Illyria. ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE: EVOLUTION OF ITS ROLE IN ALBANIAN SOCIETY: Maria Grazia Amore, Albanian Rescue Archaeology Unit, Tirana This paper will focus on the changes in archaeological prac- tice in Albania as they are reflected by its role in society, by the institutions that administrate it, and most of all by the laws that define it. The recent and rapid development of the infra- structure of the country on the one hand, and the very well- organized looting and illegal traffic of art objects on the other, have encouraged the Albanian archaeological community to draw up a new Cultural Heritage Law, only six years after a new law was enacted in 1994. Because of the inadequacy of the governmental institutions to control strictly all of Albania and because of a lack of both human and economic resources, a new archaeological institution has been born of necessity: a Rescue Unit that is funded by foreign agencies. One of the principal goals of the new law now under discussion is to give archaeology a leading role and economic independence as the country develops: archaeologists must be consulted every time that a public work is to be undertaken, and the company involved has to cover the expenses of the resulting archaeo- logical excavation, providing archaeologists with an alterna- tive to foreign funding. It is hoped that a "public archaeology" will be established, one that can create an equilibrium be- tween the need to develop the country and the necessity to safeguard its archaeological heritage. This archaeology should bypass both the politically oriented archaeology of the Com- munist period, and the disoriented archaeology of the last decade. A NEW ALBANIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTION: Iris Pojani, International Center ofAlbanian Ar- chaeology, Tirana An important aspect of the reorganization of Albanian ar- chaeology has been the establishment, by the Packard Hu- manities Institute, of a new International Center for Albanian Archaeology. The object of this institution is to help coordi- nate, develop, and promote Albania's archaeological heritage.</page><page sequence="51">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 281 Goals of the Packard Center include the creation of an inter- national research center and library in central Tirana, the support of a constellation of major research excavations that will raise the international visibility of Albanian archaeology, and the training ofAlbanian students. Major research projects currently include excavations and survey at Durres; interna- tional collaborations at Byllis (French) and Phoenice (Ital- ian); the creation of a national park at Apollonia, similar to that already established at Butrint; and the conservation of the city of Gjirokastra. Second-year students at the University ofTirana gain field experience atApollonia and Butrint. Third- year students complete a course of study in the U.K. This training will produce a well-trained younger generation of students to manage Albania's cultural resources. SESSION 4F: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: HISTORY AND REPRESENTATION IN ROME VERGILIAN ECPHRASIS AND THE POLITICS OF VIEW- ING IN AUGUSTAN ROME: Andrew Feldherr, Princeton University The decade that produced the complex memorials of the Temple ofApollo on the Palatine and the Prima PortaAugustus also yielded the most extended and suggestive account of how viewing historical monuments can shape a collective Roman identity: the scenes where Aeneas confronts the temple of Juno at Carthage and the shield wrought by Vulcan. There have been several contrasting recent efforts to link the ambi- guities of Vergilian ecphrases to the "power of images" in Au- gustan Rome: Galinsky suggests the very prominence of art in the poem compliments the humanity of the Augustan present, while Putnam and Barchiesi present a more agonistic relation- ship between literary text and artistic monument. My paper will relate the particular position from which Aeneas views these monuments-in one case as an outsider ignorant of the history described (8.730), in another as a member of the very people whose defeat is celebrated (1.450-94)-to important methodological questions about how actual Augustan monu- ments should be read. Recent attempts to find a specific politi- cal message in imperial iconography have risked delegitimizing the interpretations of viewers from outside the triumphant national group. By showing how Vergil's poem highlights multiple perspectives on public works of art, perspectives which cannot comfortably be labeled misreadings, I argue that the Aeneid provides a more complicated model for viewers' en- counters with such representations of history and that this model, far from being an anomalous product of the poem as text, conforms to other accounts of the social effects of dis- playing the past. ROME AND TROY: THE PROBLEM OF THE EAST IN THE WEST: C. Brian Rose, University of Cincinnati Troy's location at the shortest crossing point between Eu- rope and Asia meant that the city and its mythical inhabitants were at different times associated with the East or the West. In Archaic art Trojan dress is indistinguishable from that of the Greeks, but in Greek art produced after the Persian wars, Tro- jans appear essentially as Persians, with Phrygian caps and trou- sers, and this iconography remained unchanged throughout the remainder of classical antiquity. Rome began to recognize her Trojan origins during the third century B.C., and coins struck during the war with Pyrrhus accordingly show Roma wearing a Phrygian cap. It was probably because of Rome's association with Troy that the cult of Cybele was brought to Rome from Asia Minor in 204 B.C., and images of Attis in eastern dress rapidly became a prominent part of religious life in Rome. Throughout most of the late Republic, Phrygian caps and trousers were therefore associated primarily with positive concepts. A major change occurred at the end of the Republic, when Parthia developed into the greatest foe of the Romans, and victory monuments featuring subjugated Parthians began to be erected in the Forum. At this point eastern costumes ac- quired a kind of bilingual significance: either positive or nega- tive depending on the context. During the Augustan period representations ofAeneas also changed. Ascanius was added to Aeneas groups and shown wearing trousers and a Phrygian cap, although Aeneas was never represented in eastern costume in imperial monuments. The inclusion of eastern costume was judged necessary to establish Rome's Trojan origins, but because Parthians wore the same costumes, Phrygian caps and trousers were used only for children. Monuments representing Parthians were gener- ally separated from those in which Trojans were featured, and in some monuments, such as the Ara Pacis, all of the Trojans were dressed as contemporary Romans. THE RECREATION OF TIME IN THE AUGUSTAN SECULAR GAMES: Holt N. Parker, University of Cincinnati Attempts to reduce the Secular Games of 17 B.C. to "propa- ganda" are anachronistic and sterile. I prefer to examine the festival, from the initial votes to the striking of the stages, as a site-specific Gesamtkunstwerk, using the insights ofcultural poetics that have been so fruitful for Renaissance spectacle. Here, I can only touch on the theme of permanent impermanence and three of the ways in which the Games represented and recreated history. First, the temporary stages, which recalled the conspicuous expenditures of the Republic, but freed from strife. They also served ritually to recreate primitive Rome in an act of symbolic magic. Yet the extended Games ended in the permanent The- aters of Pompey and Marcellus, binding old to new. Second, I recreate the fragmentary monumental inscription not as document but as monument. The vote to remember was made before the acts themselves. Four meters high, prominently displayed at the bend of the Tiber, the Pillar preceded the deeds it recorded. The ritual was performed in order to become a text; the text inscribed in order to become a monument. Third, Horace's Carmen Saeculare, which recreated Roman lit- erary history. It reached back to the primal rites ofRoman poetry, especially Andronicus's expiatory carmen (Fraenkel was wrong here). Unlike the mercifully mangled hexameters on the monu- ment of the Severan Games, Horace's carmen was deliberately not inscribed. Augustus chose Horace because he knew his po- ems would last (mansura). Exegi monumentum, but the voice is that ofAugustus. TALKING FOR THE HEADS: CICERO'S RE-PRESEN- TATION OF STATUARY: Eleanor Winsor Leach, In- diana University In many ofCicero's oratorical topographies, statues occupy places no less significant than in the Roman cityscape. Mate-</page><page sequence="52">282 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 rial statues purportedly communicate with their viewers through shared codes of meaning. The viewer sees not only a person, a deity, or a Polycleitan masterwork, but also its relationship with institutions of the state. Recent scholarship has cast new light on these communications. Sehlmoyer (Stuttgart 1999) shows the late Republic as a critical time in the politicization of statuary. Tanner (JRS [2000] 18-50) has further explored the semiotics of verism within this political context. As representations of representation, Cicero's statues carry the politics of signification into rhetorically reorganized con- texts. Oratorical manipulation of the viewer's perspective high- lights a basic instability of meaning in the image as when Cicero reveals the origin of Clodius's goddess Libertas as the memorial to a Tanagrian whore and contrasts her with the chaste Concordiawhom the Censor C. Cassius had dedicated in the senate house. In Verrines2.4, Cicero's most populous sculp- ture gallery, we see the gilded pretentious statues Verres had extorted from the Syracusan clients against the venerable masterworks that the unscrupulous praetor has stolen. Philippics 9 foregrounds a statue of the consular Servius Sulpicius Rufus not yet erected in contrast with Antony's decadent living body. Statues, as Cicero observes in the ProArchia, are images merely of bodies, not minds, and the orator shows them subject to verbal resculpturing. ON THE AUCTION BLOCK: SLAVES AND THEIR HIS- TORIES: Barbara Kellum, Smith College According to Roman law, slaves were things. For this rea- son, it has often been said that slaves have no histories. This paper will challenge such a view by focusing on the inscrip- tional and visual evidence of former slaves who chose to repre- sent themselves on their funerary monuments with scenes of slaves being sold on the auction block. In two instances, the freedmen may have gone on to become slave dealers them- selves, which makes these images doubly nuanced, but all the examples share an unabashed directness in depicting the economy of enslavement in the most explicit terms. The mo- ment of what we might assume to be the ultimate degradation seems to have functioned for freedmen as their point of his- torical origin-the first step toward their manumission. These monuments suggest a new reading of what has usually been interpreted as one of the fictional freedman Trimalchio's more colossal errors in taste: the fresco depicting his career from the slavemarket to his elevation to sevir Augustalis (Sat. 29). Moreover, I will argue that an interpretation of the auction block scenes as inaugural moments of selfhood highlights the profound differences between the Roman slave system, where manumission included limited citizenship rights, and that of any other culture. A more multivalent model of history and representation reveals that, rather than trying to "pass" as freeborn, Roman freedpeople celebrated their own founda- tion stories, much as in the rags to riches tales of contempo- rary mime ( The Runaway Slave Strikes It Rich). THE PRAETORIAN GUARD IN ROMAN ART: Harriet I. Flower, Franklin and Marshall College My paper discusses the particular iconography ofpraetorian guardsmen in Roman state art and its relationship to the chang- ing political role of the emperor's own bodyguard. Praetorians are often not specifically identified by art historians, yet they do appear with some frequency, especially in Roman historical reliefs. I establish criteria for recognizing praetorians in Ro- man art, and then go on to enumerate the principal, extant monuments on which they appear. The varied ways in which they are portrayed are closely linked to their evolving role in the politics of the empire, as well as to the urban context of each relief. Their images in state reliefs can also be associated with their appearance on coins, which reflect an emperor's desire to appease to control them. Their dress and equipment is sometimes that of soldiers on campaign, as on the arch of Claudius, or on the column of Trajan. Yet, within the city of Rome, they actually onlywore full armor when accompanying a captured enemy leader. By contrast, on the Puteoli reliefs, or on the Arco di Portogallo relief, they attend the emperor in simple traveling clothes. The Anaglypha Traiani/Hadriani and the Chatsworth relief show them burning debt records, prob- ably in the forum of Trajan. However, they are never por- trayed in the togas they wore every day when they were guard- ing the emperor's palace. Their final defeat at the battle of the Milvian bridge is vividly depicted on the arch of Constantine, who also finally disbanded their units. SESSION 4G: COLLOQUIUM: COLLOQUIUM ON CULTURAL PROPERTY CAN THERE BE A COMMON GROUND? DIFFERING VIEWS OF KENNEWICK MAN AS CULTURAL HER- ITAGE: Francis P. McManamon, National Park Service The chance discovery of a nearly complete 9,000 year-old human skeleton on federal land in Kennewick, Washington set archaeological professionals and interested members of the public abuzz with speculations about the ancient history of the Pacific Northwest and migrations of the earliest settlers of America. The discovery also ignited traditionalists among Ameri- can Indians in a crusade to ensure that the remains were not defiled, but instead were quickly and reverently reburied. In attempting to determine the best course of action, the De- partment of the Interior and National Park Service conducted a variety of scientific investigations and consulted extensively with representatives of the involved Indian tribes. Although to this point, much has been accomplished, common ground among the variety of interested parties has not been reached. It may be that a completely mutually agreeable solution is not possible in this situation. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE STEINHARDT PHIALE DECISION: Patty Gerstenblith, DePaul University College of Law In 1998, the Archaeological Institute ofAmerica entered as an amicus curiae a case on appeal before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involved the theft and smuggling of an ancient gold phiale which was taken from Sicily and purchased by a NewYork collector. The court's decision ayear later sent the phiale back to Italy but left questions concern- ing the recognition of Italy's national ownership law unan- swered. During the past three years several other issues con- cerning the Cultural Property Implementation Act, the bilat- eral agreement between Italy and the United States to re- strict import of undocumented antiquities, and the draft UNESCO Underwater Cultural Heritage Convention have developed. This paper will evaluate these recent develop- ments in the field of cultural property law and the role that</page><page sequence="53">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 283 the AIA has played and can play in shaping these develop- ments. This paper will also examine the increasingly active role that the museum community has taken in these same issues. Finally, the paper will consider the status of cultural property as the common heritage of the world and the obliga- tions that this status imposes on both individual nations and the international community. LAW, POLITICS, AND ARCHAEOLOGY: A BRIEF LEG- ISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CONVENTION ON CUL- TURAL PROPERTY IMPLEMENTATION ACT: Ma- rina Papa Sokal, City College, City University of New York This paper is a study of the U.S. ratification of the UNESCO Convention of 1970 and of the legislative history of the Con- vention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA) of 1983. By examining the relevant Congressional documents (Senate and House hearings and debates), I trace the origin of the reservation and understandings that the Senate added when it ratified the UNESCO treaty in 1972 as well as the particular interests and politics that played a role in shaping the implementation lawin its present (and, I will argue, flawed) form. I will also briefly examine the pending bill, recently introduced by Senator Moynihan and others, to amend the CCPIA, particularly with reference to the proposed changes in the role and composition of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC). PROVENANCE: WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT MATTERS So MUCH: Christopher Chippindale, Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthro- pology, and David W.J. Gill, University of Wales, Swansea The "provenance" of an object is what we know about what it is and where it comes from, beyond what we can deduce from the thing itself. That knowledge divides into two parts, one ancient and one modern: what we can know about the object's ancient story from its findspot and context is the object's archaeology; what happened to it after it left the ground is the object's history. There always have been, and surely always will be, some unprovenanced antiquities, fine ancient things which just "surface" without archaeology or even history. Our studies, published by the AJA, have begun to give a quantitative account: just how many things of certain types "surface" and with what material consequences. In this paper we report new work that explores the intellectual con- sequences of that habitual loss of provenance, a sad and grave impoverishment of what we can know about ancient worlds as they actually were, and a permanent loss we impose on future generations. That there is a loss has long been recognized; how large, deep, and tragic it is has not. COUNTING THE COSTS OF COLLECTING APULIAN RED-FIGURE POTTERY: RicardoJ. Elia, Boston University A quantitative study of more than 13,000 Apulian red-fig- ure pots offers a startling indictment of the role of collectors and the antiquities market in stimulating the looting of ar- chaeological sites in south Italy. Although Apulian pottery has been collected for more than 250 years, the evidence indi- cates a virtual flooding of the international market with unprovenienced Apulian pots in the last three decades. The enrichment of hundreds ofAmerican and European museums and private collections with Apulian pottery during this period coincides with a plague of looting in Puglia that is well-docu- mented by archaeologists on the ground and through the efforts of Italian law enforcement agencies. This study contra- dicts the claims of collectors and other advocates of the antiq- uities trade that most of the material on the market derives from old collections rather than contemporary pillage. RECONTEXTUALIZING STOLEN ANTIQUITIES: Malcom Bell, III, University of Virginia Like many other Mediterranean sites, Morgantina has suf- fered extensive archaeological looting. Until the 1970s ille- gal digging was concentrated in the cemeteries, but more recent use of the metal detector has made the habitation an easy target. The city was captured by the Romans in 211 B.C., when much precious metal was evidently buried for safekeep- ing, as both legitimate and clandestine finds have indicated. The latter include several important coin hoards, now dis- persed, as well as a treasure of Hellenistic silver today in the Metropolitan Museum ofArt. The U.S. excavators of Morgantina have attempted to recontextualize some of these finds through excavation, in the interest of both shedding light on works of great historical importance and assisting in the Italian efforts to recover them. Working closely with the authorities, we were able to excavate the specific findspot of the silver treasure in NewYork, which proved to be a house of the Greek period abandoned at the end of the third century B.C. Evidence was found indicating that the treasure was hidden after 214 B.C.; graffito inscrip- tions on the silver identify the last owner, whose name is otherwise known at Morgantina in a contemporary document. A similar attempt will be made to recontextualize two acrolithic marble sculptures of late Archaic date, looted at Morgantina in 1979 and now in a private collection in New York. It is hoped that such efforts at recovering the actual circumstances of clandestine excavation will contribute to dis- couraging purchase by collectors and museums of unprovenanced antiquities. SESSION 4H: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: NONVERBAL BEHAVIORS IN ANCIENT LIFE, LITERATURE, AND ART LEAVING WORDS BEHIND: NONVERBAL ELEMENTS IN THE ARCHAIC DEPARTURE SCENE: Elizabeth S. Greene, Princeton University Since the seminal work of W. Arend, analysis of typical motifs has become commonplace in Homeric scholarship. Stud- ies have focused on traditional elements, verbal and nonver- bal, that occur in scenes of shared subject. Using the motif of departure as a test case, I compare the structure of the leave- taking scenes in Homeric epic with that of similar scenes painted on Archaic vases. As E.A. Mackay (Oral Tradition 10 [1995] 301) has argued, the strategic usage of traditional elements to form a typical scene is not unique to epic poetry, but reflects a mode of construction used by Archaic poets and artists alike.</page><page sequence="54">284 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 A complete Homeric departure scene performed for a trav- eler or warrior includes the following elements: farewell speech to the departing figure, farewell speech by the departing figure, libation or prayer to the gods, preparations for the departure, and the reactions of the figures who remain be- hind. Of these elements, half use oral communication, half are performed by the characters in the scene. In Archaic vase painting, the gestures, actions, and accoutrements of the participants eliminate the need for speeches. No words emerge from the painted figures, but the departures are as recognizable as the Homeric passages. The vases present a compact chronological snapshot of the epic leave-takings. Within a single panel, the painter captures the content, context, and emotion of the departures. In the performance of formal behavior, such as the etiquette surrounding type scenes of departure, nonverbal elements convey meaning as effectively as speeches. A TEMPLE OF HER OWN: GENDERED PROXEMICS IN THE HOMERIC HYMN T7 DEMETER: Dianna Rhyan Kardulias, College of Wooster Attending to nonverbal behavior in the Homeric Hymn to Demeterreveals abrupt alterations in location, position, and cos- tume. Males initiate, but females live out such changes: wander- ing, wearing disguises, disfiguring themselves; exhibiting ter- ror, rage, or "doglike" silence; rending garments, screaming, slapping thighs, leaping, embracing. Persephone's initial dislo- cation at Hades' hands and the goddesses' final seats beside Zeus frame significant gender distinctions in nonverbal behav- ior, specifically gendered uses of space (proxemics; Lateiner 1992; Poyatos 1983, 1992). Involuntarily mobile females par- take in and further ancient Greek cultural definitions of gen- der (Neuberger-Donath 1996; cf. Konstan 1994; Just 1989; Zeitlin 1985; Keuls 1985; Halperin et al. 1990; Winkler 1990; Blok and Mason 1987). Demeter, a strategically immobile fe- male who status-consciously manipulates space, challenges gen- der expectations and seeks to remediate real and perceived gender-based deficiencies. During Persephone's abduction (seemingly irrevocable dislocation; Lateiner 2000; Laiou 1993; Evans-Grubbs 1989; Herzfeld 1985), Demeter tears her veil (41), signifying grief, physical vulnerability, loss of standing, and rejection of sexuality (Nagler 1974; Segal 1971; Levine 1995; Goffman 1963). She vocally mourns (Holst-Warbaft 1992) then dislocates herself as withered crone, on the ground, on a low stool, and at the hearth under cover of night, "greeting up" (like beggar Odysseus, Lateiner 1995; Goody 1972) and telling pirate tales of wandering enslavement. Yet late in this battle between the sexes (Arthur 1977; Foley 1994; DeBloois 1997), Demeter employs new proxemics. In her Eleusinian temple (archaeologically imaginary or not, Clinton 1986, 1992, 1993), surrounded by worshippers who fearfully quake (293; cf. 281- 2), dark (as Hades, cf. 40-42,182-3, 360;Johnston 1994; Felson- Rubin and Deal 1980), and elevated, her adjusted body adap- tors, manipulation of speech protocols and refusal to "mingle" (pioyg-~at 355) declare strategy revisions. GESTURE, CHARACTER, AND NARRATIVE: NONVER- BAL PORTRAYAL AND THE SUCCESS OF ATHE- NIAN IMAGERY: TimothyJ. McNiven, Ohio State University Despite all the discussion of Greek visual narrative (e.g., Stansbury-O'Donnell 1999), few scholars have examined the conventions that make narrative effective. Among the most important are gestures. How gestures function to further the narrative, and what they add to an image's ability to tell a story, is the object of this study. Through the sixth and fifth centuries, Athenian pottery painters developed a vocabulary of gestures to help them tell a story visually. With increasing subtlety and variety, this rep- ertoire of arm, hand, and finger positions allowed painters to indicate concisely the reactions and emotions of the charac- ters in the scene. The broad range of conscious signals and unconscious re- actions seen on Kleitias's Francois Vase (ca. 570) can be traced down to the vases of Beazley's Leagros Group 50 years later. In the first decades of the fifth century, red-figure artists portrayed an increasingly broad range of interior emo- tional states through pose and gesture, at a time when early theater must have been exploring similar devices. Monu- mental painting and fully developed tragedy led to the intro- duction of gestures with a new level of psychological insight. This trend continued, and, by the late fifth century, painters used gestures to express interior states more than exterior ones. In Greek art there are few methods other than gesture to indicate character traits, one of the most important aspects of narration. The success ofAthenian narrative art can there- fore be closely linked to the development of a flexible and subtle vocabulary of conventional gestures. THE BARE FEET SPEAK: NONVERBAL MESSAGES OF BAREFOOTEDNESS: Daniel Levine, University of Arkansas This paper investigates the literary and artistic messages projected by the nonverbal dichotomy of shod/unshod. Contrasts between barefootedness and being shod appear meaningfully in Greek art, from Mycenaean "funerary boots" through Classical sculpture (architectural and stele reliefs). Numerous Greek vase paintings seem to contrast barefoot and shod characters to express a particular mood or meaning. Positive images of barefootedness appear in references to military training without sandals. Apologiae for barefootedness also include defense of unshod philosophers, ancient heroes and goddesses, stressing beauty and practi- cality. When exercise became a fashionable medical therapy, Asclepius prescribed walking and running barefoot, even when logic deemed such behavior inappropriate. Silent feet tell tales. Greeks were acutely aware of the appearance of feet, and often recognized others by this part of their body, or the prints they made. Religious awe precluded wearing shoes on "holy ground." Bare feet show humility and respect, while footwear can pollute. Haste and enthusiasm prevent people from stop- ping to dress or put on shoes. If a character is barefoot, she/ he is likely in a hurry. Bare feet are sexual; POUS is slang in old comedy for "penis," and several late Greek letters fetishize the feet and share the strongly erotic character of foot-worshipping passages in the ancient literature of India. This eroticism of bare feet contrasts with the Aristotelian admonition that bare feet are not advantageous for sexual intercourse. Further iconographic studies will help us to appreciate more fully how going without shoes makes a nonverbal statement.</page><page sequence="55">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 285 NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR ON THE ROMAN COMIC STAGE: Costas Panayotakis, University of Glasgow, Scotland This paper is a reminder of the pitfalls associated with tracing signs of nonverbal behavior in Roman comic drama, and sug- gests fruitful lines of inquiry in this fascinating field. The absence of ancient handbooks on acting and of explicit stage directions in theatrical texts, and the improvisational na- ture of comedy and mime have caused much speculation on the movements actors and actresses performed on stage. Scholars seek the evidence for gestures in visual material illustrating theatrical scenes, in Cicero's and Quintilian's educational in- structions, and in nondramatic texts heavily influenced by drama. This approach is methodologically hazardous, for it ultimately produces only a list of vague allusions to nonverbal behavior defined by nondramatists as "theatrical," itdraws artificial bound- aries between behavioral patterns such as "normal" and "histri- onic," "acceptable" and "obscene," and it fails to prove that the same gestures of, say, fear were systematically exploited when- ever an actor needed to express fear. I suggest that the transmitted text is our best guide in visual- izing the stage action of a comedy. Playwrights may provide the necessary stage directions in the following ways: comments on the characters' actions, demonstrative pronouns or comparative clauses, a character's description of the posture of another char- acter, figures of speech that emphasize the intensity of ges- tures, use of music and metre, or by inviting the audience to imagine tears or facial expressions, and by creating scenes with lively subject matter. Nonverbal behavior, however, is aimed at reinforcing the dramatic context to which it belonged, not at replacing or "upstaging" the playwright's script. GESTURE AND IDENTITY: DEPICTIONS OF ROMAN FREEDWOMEN IN FUNERARY CONTEXT: Jasmin W. Cyril, University of Minnesota In terms of nonverbal communication, the coded informa- tion recognizable in representations of Roman freedwomen is indicative of a conscious determination to identify the subject of the portrait in the context of the transitional status achieved through manumission. This paper seeks to address the issues and nonverbal behaviors apparent in Roman funerary relief sculpted portraits commissioned by freedwomen in the early Empire. This aspect of these works has not been formally considered or addressed in previous studies of this genre of material in terms of the recognition of status from the identi- fiable reference point of the Roman freedwomen's own view of herself and her modified status. As the monuments existed apart from textual explanation beyond the inscriptions identifying the patron, here specifi- cally chosen works commissioned by freedwomen, they have explicit and implicit nonverbal markers of acquired and per- ceived status sanctioned by the women depicted. An example of primary information indicating perceived modification or achievement of status is represented by dextrarum iunctio. The aim of this study is to underscore the significant body of non- verbal communicative behaviors which Roman freedwomen utilized in their monuments to transmit complex ideas about themselves and their relationship to immediate associates and Roman society at large. This study will demonstrate that apart from the legal and societal issues addressed by specific nonver- bal markers, the relief portraits encode heretofore unrevealed issues of self-recognition and appreciation. SESSION 5A: THE BLACK SEA SINOP PROVINCE (TURKEY) ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: 2001 FIELD REPORT: Owen P. Doonan, IV, University of Pennsylvania Museum This field report presents the results of the 2001 field in- vestigations in the hinterland of Sinop, Turkey. The 2001 field season builds on four seasons of survey and one season of sondage excavations at the site of Sinop kale, carried out from 1996-2000. In four seasons of survey over 170 sites have been documented, ranging from Upper Paleolithic to Ottoman in date. During the 2001 season we plan to conduct geophysical and geochemical investigations and small-scale sondage exca- vations at several prehistoric sites that have been documented by the survey. Our primary goals are to recover ceramics from intact contexts that can be dated by associated 1"C remains and to recover floral data that can be used to reconstruct ancient climate and ecology. We also plan to continue our program ofgeomorphological reconstruction of coastal evolu- tion in Sarikum on the western side of Sinop promontory. DYNAMICS OF CHANGE: THE RURAL LANDSCAPE OF THE BOSPORAN KINGDOM: Jane E. Rempel, University of Michigan During the fourth through second centuries B.C., there was a marked increase in rural settlement in the territory of the Bosporan kingdom, on the north coast of the Black Sea. This change in the rural landscape reflects a larger change in the social landscape of the region. Prior to this period of expansion, there was a clear delinea- tion between the urban territory of the cities (founded as Greek colonies) and the rural land used by groups of people native to the region. Thus, these new rural settlements physi- cally claimed territory that had not been previously occupied by the Bosporan kingdom. Because the new rural settlements were constructed in a Greek style, it has been assumed that they represent an expansion into the hinterland by the urban Greek population. This visual appropriation of the landscape by the cultural symbols of the Bosporan urban elite, however, did not exclude the native inhabitants. In fact, the evidence suggests that the local population was often incorporated into the new settle- ments. At the same time, social and civic life in the cities was altered by increasing non-Greek participation. This paper argues that these new rural settlements cannot be understood as merely Greek, or even Hellenized, but in- stead reflected, and perhaps contributed to, a more inclusive conception of membership in Bosporan society. As such, the symbols of Greek culture that had been the sole preserve of the urban elite were accessible to, and reinterpreted by, a larger and more heterogeneous group of people. A MISINTERPRETED AND FORGOTTEN EARLY RO- MAN AUXILIARY CAMP IN MOESIA INFERIOR: Steven A. Krebs, Indiana University In 1913Vasile Pirvan, the father of Romanian archaeology, excavated an Early Roman auxiliary camp 4 km to the east of Pantelimonul de Sus in central Dobrogea, the region of Roma- nia between the Black Sea and the Danube River (V. Pirvan,</page><page sequence="56">286 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 "Descoperiri noua in Scythia Minor," AnaleleAcademieiRomane 35 [1913] 526-31). Pairvan misidentified the site as a tempo- rary, summer marching camp, i.e., CastraAestiva, because of a lack of building stone. He also neglected to examine the ancient ceramics on the site. Thus was the only extant Early Roman castraunburdened by later construction forgotten until this author's intensive survey of the Castra Aestiva in 1993 (S. Krebs, "Settlement in Classical Dobrogea," Ph.D. diss. [Indiana University 2000]). I examine the role of this forgotten auxiliary camp in the larger context of a frontier province which was protected in the second half of the first century A.C. by the Danube fleet at Noviodunum, a legion posted to a camp near Tomis, the capital of Moesia, a vexillatio of the Fifth Macedonian Legion at Troesmis, and a number of auxiliary units defended the lower Danube frontier. A strong Roman presence along the lower Danube frontier permitted colonization by Romanized settlers from the western provinces, who encroached quickly upon the lands of the Greek cities, particularly Histria. Barbar- ian incursions from beyond the Danube were no more a threat to the development of Moesia Inferior than they were to the other Danube provinces (contra A.G. Poulter, "The Lower Moesian Limes and the Dacian Wars of Trajan," Studien zu den Militdrgrenzen Roms IHI. 13. Internationaler LimeskongrefJ [Stuttgart 1986] 519-28). THE CHORA OF CHERSONESOS IN CRIMEA IN THE EARLY HELLENISTIC PERIOD: Jessica Trelogan, Institute of Classical Archaeology, University of Texas at Austin, and Galina Nikolaenko, National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos, Ukraine The Chora of Chersonesos is perhaps the best known ex- ample of a well-preserved ancient territory from the Greek period. Until very recently, however, there were no accurate plans of it. The author, working with the Center for Space Research and on a grant from NASA, has created a detailed and accurate representation of the Chora's topography (DEM) and of the system of stone-paved country roads that divided it into over 400 more or less uniform 26 ha (60 acre) farm plots. She will work with her colleague, Galina Nikolaenko, this sum- mer to document and locate on the plan, as well as document in a multilayered GIS, all of the 140 excavated and unexcavated rural estates. This work will be carried on in June andJuly in the Archives, the Preserve, and in the field. EXCAVATIONS AT CHERSONESOS (SEVASTOPOL, UKRAINE) 2001: PaulArthur, Universitai de Lecci, Italy, and Larissa Sedikova, National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos, Ukraine The site excavated in 2001 lies on a high point of Chersonesos, immediately within the Roman walls, against which had been built a public water reservoir. The reservoir, abandoned during the ninth century, was later used as a rub- bish dump, perhaps signaling the end of piped water to the city. New excavations revealed an impressive main street, over 5 m wide, and part of an insula on the other side of the street to the reservoir. To the north, it was fronted by a major building and by a yard bordered by a church. Perhaps dating from the 11th-12th century, the church may have served the popula- tion of the insula. In another part of the yard was a cellar containing fish remains, among other things. The major building to the immediate west of the church and yard, had, at least, five rooms. It may date as early as the 10th or 11th centuries though was destroyed around the 13th century. A Byzantine iron processional cross found in one of the rooms suggests that the building may have housed a priest. Some wealth seems indicated by abundant Zeuxippus ware and turquoise- glazed Islamic pottery. It is too early to decide whether or not the complex, as other parts of the city, had been destroyed during a Tatar sack in the latter half of the 13th century. Nonetheless, later pot- tery shows that occupation probably continued down to Otto- man times, in the late 15th century. A NEW SCYTHIAN COIN TYPE FROM THE WESTERN PONTIC REGION: Elena Stolyarik, The American Numismatic Society Several years ago bronze coins bearing the types of Dionysus head/Galloping Horseman but without indication of either ruler's name or mintwere found near Dionysopolis. The same type is present in the collection of the American Numismatic Society. The depiction of the Horseman is analogous to Scythian images of Greek-Scythian toreutics and was origi- nally dated to the period of the Scythian rulers of "Scythia Minor" in Dobrudja (third through early second century B.C.). This paper revises the date of this issue based on stylistic analy- sis and written sources. The coins of "Scythia Minor" normally bear the names of the kings responsible for their issue and borrow types from the autonomous emissions of Western Pontic cities, which are sty- listically different from the Dionysus/Horseman types. The image of the horseman seems more closely related to the reverse types used by the Scythian king Ateas, killed by Philip II in 339 B.C. At the same time, the combination of an obverse depicting a deity and a reverse depicting a horseman has close analogy with bronzes of Philip II, Lysimachus, and Thracian dynasts. The Dionysus/Horseman coinage was influenced by Macedonian typology and should be seen as a transitional type between the classical fine style of Philip II's coinage, and the descriptive traditions of the dawning Hellenistic age. The ab- sence of the king's name and mint mark suggests that the purpose of the issue was not mainly economic, but rather to advertise Scythian power, perhaps during their alliance with the Western Pontic cities against Lysimachus in 312 B.C. SESSION 5B: NORTH AFRICA AND THE NEAR EAST EGO LIBYPHOENIX: CULTURE AND COMMUNITY IN THE CARTHAGINIAN SAHEL: Douglas Welle, SUNY at Buffalo The study of Phoenician North Africa has often focused on the metropolis of Carthage, often ignoring the presence of indigenous African groups. Pliny and Livy each mention Libyphoenicians, a culturally hybridized group that inhabited the eastern coast, or Sahel, of modern Tunisia. Despite Carthage's economic and military empire in the Mediterra- nean west, the funerary archaeology of the Tunisian Sahel is distinct from the material evidence in the major Carthaginian</page><page sequence="57">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 287 cemeteries. This underscores the varying cultural traditions and local identities which persisted within 50 miles from Carthage. Examining the coastal cemeteries from Hadrumetum to Gigthis, this paper argues that the Sahelian funerary record reflects local cultural traditions, as expressed though locally manufactured pottery and grave goods. The use of wooden paneling and coffins in tomb chambers is characteristic of sev- eral Sahelian sites, as is the ritual application ofvermilion to the corpse. Distinctive tomb architecture and evidence for graveside ritual suggest hybridized precolonial African and Phoenician traditions which continued into the Roman period. The second part of this paper examines the political and economic significance of Libyphoenician communities in the Roman period. The enduring Phoenician municipal office of suffete serves as a political expression among Libyphoenician communities and their elites. In addition to exploitation of marine resources, coastal Libyphoenician communities con- nected the sea-borne economy of the Roman empire to the "agricultural revolution" in grain and olive oil production that characterized Africa Proconsularis. PURPLE, MARBLE, AND BARBARIANS: MENINX AND THE IMPACT OF LUXURY: ThomasJ. Morton, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Writing in the first century A.D., Pliny the Elder states that the purple dye created from the murex shellfish at Meninx was the best in Africa (NH 9.60). By providing this exclusive item for the Roman elite, Meninx acquired another sort of luxury item: expensive building materials, at a scale unrivaled in neighboring cities. The resulting richness of architecture at Meninx was unparalleled in the region. From the early 19th century, visitors to Meninx have commented upon the city's architectural wealth, especially in the forum, where one of its most notable structures is also one of the most elusive. Surviv- ing in scattered architectural and sculptural fragments as well as in limited in situ remains is the city's civil basilica. For the first time, systematic and careful archaeological study of the extant ruins permits a secure reconstruction and identifica- tion of the structure as an early second-century A.D. civil ba- silica. Like the Basilicas Aemelia and Ulpia in Rome, the ba- silica at Meninx was adorned with sculptures of barbarians carved from rare, decorated stones. The striated purplish-red stone used for the sculptures at Meninx was not chosen by accident. Prominently displayed on one of the city's most im- portant structures, the figures clad in purple garments not only responded to what was in Rome, but alluded to the famed purple dye production of Meninx. This paper addresses my reconstruction of the basilica and my interpretation of the sculptures ofbarbarians. EXCAVATING GRAECO-ROMAN HOUSES AT TEBTUNIS: A PRELIMINARY REPORT: D.J. Ian Begg, Trent University Tebtunis is one of the most extensively preserved and ex- cavated Graeco-Roman sites in Egypt. The first papyrological explorations in 1899 by Grenfell and Hunt provided artifacts now at Berkeley. After a brief probing of houses by Rubensohn in 1902, a series of Italian excavations began in 1929. Breccia dug a few houses before turning the concession over to Carlo Anti of Padua, who cleared several houses and streets. In 1931 Gilbert Bagnani joined the excavations and they discovered an enormous sanctuary of the crocodile god Souchos; this was archaeologically important because all the priests' houses and workshops were still intact. Bagnani excavated the monks' houses and frescoed churches of a Coptic monastery in 1933 and, in 1934, a rectangular insula incorporating a series of Roman period houses. Although excavations continued until 1936, only a few early preliminary reports ever appeared. The exported artifacts today are in Milan and Turin. In 1988, the French Institute in Cairo resumed excavations at the site. Bagnani left his papers, including the missing notebooks, photos, and other material from the Italian excavations, to the Archives at Trent University, Peterborough, Canada. By com- bining these with archival evidence in Berkeley, Padua, Milan, and Turin and autopsy at the site, it is possible to reexamine material from the old excavations for their eventual publica- tion. This illustrated paper is a preliminary report to present the evidence as so far assembled for Graeco-Roman and priestly houses at Tebtunis. FIELDWORK AT TEL KEDESH, ISRAEL, 2000-2001: Sharon Herbert, University of Michigan, and An- drea M. Berlin, University of Minnesota Tel Kedesh lies on the border between ancient Palestine and Phoenicia. It was occupied from the Early Bronze Age to modern times. Kedesh is mentioned in several Hellenistic sources. These led us to expect a small rural village and garri- son in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods, control of which passed back and forth between Hellenized Phoenicians of Tyre andJews. Our excavation was planned to explore in- teractions between Greek, Jewish, and Phoenician elements over time. Our previous work at Kedesh included remote sensing and exploratory probes, on the basis ofwhich we focused our exca- vation at the south end of the tel. There we are uncovering a large public building (ca. 2,000 m2) of Hellenistic date. The administrative function of the building is documented by its size, storage capability, and an archive room containing 2,300 bullae dating from 220 to 150 B.C.E. The images on the bullae are drawn predominantly from Geek myth and portrait types, but a few bear Phoenician symbols and two carry bilingual Greek and Phoenician texts. The building appears to have been built over a Persian antecedent, abandoned in the mid second century B.C.E., and reoccupied later in that century. No Roman remains have been found in the area. Our 2001 excavations will concentrate on this building. Since no close parallels exist, we think it necessary to at- tempt large-scale horizontal exposure. We are also seeking to better understand the later Hellenistic occupation and the construction date and antecedents of the Hellenistic structure. RECENT WORK AT PISIDIAN ANTIOCH: Mehmet Taylialan, Yalva; Museum, Turkey, and John W Humphrey, University of Calgary Following the systematic survey of Pisidian Antioch by Mitchell and Waelkens in 1982-1983, Dr. Mehmet Taglialan, director of the local museum atYalvaq, has been conducting a program of cleaning and excavation aimed at clarifying some of the problems raised by that nonintrusive survey, as well as bringing to light more of the city's defensive fortifications and new elements of several buildings, including the baths, basilica, and parts of the Augustan sanctuary.</page><page sequence="58">288 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 In May andJune of 2001, a small team of volunteers, work- ing on behalf of the museum, first conducted a new architec- tural survey of the site, to produce an updated version of the 1983 plan that now includes all structures revealed over the past two decades. Second, the clearing and study of areas pre- viously excavated at the ends of the cardo helped clarify its junction with the decumanus, and its relationship to the nymphaeum at its north end. Finally, a limited magnetic sur- vey in four areas of the site showed that much could be recov- ered by this noninvasive technique; most significantly, the area previously thought to contain a palaestra shows instead the plan of a Christian basilica, while survey of other areas revealed houses, streets, important elements in the water sys- tem, and industrial establishments. It is our hope that these modest efforts will mark the begin- ning of a new program of scientific excavation and consolida- tion appropriate to the significance of this Hellenistic city and Roman colony. THE PETRA GREAT TEMPLE ELEPHANT-HEADED CAPITALS AS A CULTURAL ARTIFACT: Martha SharpJoukowsky, Brown University Petra has the reputation as being the nexus for the caravan trade. Nabataean commercial history, however, is not well- referenced in the texts. My study of the Asian elephant-headed capitals of the triple colonnade of the Great Temple's Lower Temenos has carried on since their discovery and identifica- tion some six years ago. The 320 fragments and four complete capitals recovered after nine years of the Brown University Petra Great Temple Excavations are intriguing. The study of these capitals forces us to go beyond the traditional confines of the Nabataean world. Data on like sculptures offer an index of Petra's role in commerce with the Indian Ocean and estab- lishes eastern contacts with these regions where it is assumed these sculptures originated. By integrating these ideas with a focus on the results of our 2001 field campaign, we will hope to clarify, critically review, and define the Petra Great Temple architecture and its unique cultural traditions. HONORING HADRIAN'S VISIT TO PETRA: A RE- EVALUATION OF THE TREASURY: Susan Gelb, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin In A.D. 131 the emperor Hadrian visited Petra,Jordan, as part of his trip to the Decapolis cities of the Near East. Despite the fact that the city was renamed in his honor, archaeologists have yet to reveal a monument constructed to honor the emperor's visit, a deviation from the standard procedure along thisjourney. Based on architectural analysis ofother "Hadrianic" monuments, literary evidence, and a study of the deities wor- shipped at Petra, the monument known as the "Treasury" is in fact a temple to Isis, constructed for Hadrian's visit. This monu- ment would thus represent the southernmost extent of his journey. The Treasury at Petra, Jordan has previously been identi- fied as a tomb for the Nabataean king Aretas IV and dated to the first century B.C. based on an architectural comparison with other monuments at Petra. By comparing the Treasury to other monuments in the Near East, it is possible to identify and date this monumentwithin a broader context rather than relying on evidence from Petra alone. Moreover, studies of papyrus fragments from this period and the ancient shrines at the site support the identification of Isis, the protectress of Petra, as the patron deity of this monument. Studying the Treasurywith a type of comparative analysis not limited to its immediate surroundings, adding evidence from literary sources, and studying ancient religious practice at Petra provides a more thorough methodology for a study of this sort, thus leading to a new identification of the monument. THE FOUR TRIBES AND FOUR TEMPLES OF PALMYRA, SYRIA: Cynthia Finlayson, Brigham Young Uni- versity At least three ancient Greek and Aramaic inscriptions from Palmyra specifically mention that by A.D. 171 this important Syrian oasis was divided for governmental and religious pur- poses into four major tribes, each associated with its own par- ticular temple. Previous scholars including Schlumberger, Dunant, and Gawlikowski have attempted to pinpoint these tribal associations in an effort to locate the major cult centers of Palmyra, once the architectural gem of the Roman frontier. Significantly, previous scholarship and excavation have only revealed two of these structures, the Temple of Allat and that of Baalshamin. At AIA 2000, I presented my initial analysis of female Palmyrene sculptural headdress styles. That study established a categorization of headdresses by style and burial location, an interpretation of headdress motifs, and pointed to the poten- tial of utilizing such information to locate the lost tribal re- gions of the city. This paper fulfills that potential by specifi- cally addressing the tribal composition of Roman-era Palmyra, pinpointing the probable locations of the two lost temples, and outlining the political and economic alliances of the Tadmor region through a careful analysis of excavation data, epigraphic material, and headdress analysis. This has been accomplished after five years of research scholarship and on-site analysis at Palmyra. Such a study not only points to the potential excava- tion locations of the two lost temples, but aids scholars in understanding the unique role Palmyra played in the political, religious, and military milieu of the eastern Roman frontier. THE MIDDLE HADRAMAWT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SUR- VEY: SHIFTING SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN PRE- ISLAMIC AND EARLY ISLAMIC SOUTH ARABIA: Paul C. Zimmerman, University of Pennsylvania The Middle Hadramawt Archaeological Survey is the field- work componentof the author's dissertation research. Through vehicular and walking survey, considerable detail has been added to the archaeological map of the Wadi Hadramawt, Yemen. In the course of three short seasons, dozens of sites were found-filling in previously blank areas of the map and recording sites of otherwise underrepresented time periods. Whereas general trends (related, undoubtedly, to broad cli- matic changes and increasing societal complexity) span the prehistory and history of this valley system, specific socioeco- nomic factors can be proposed for the settlement patterns of the pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods. Namely, control of the incense trade route manifested itself in the aggregation of settlements at strategic locations along the route. This ag- gregation was also accompanied by an increase in the size of the largest settlements and the installation of caravansaries at the confluence of major valleys. By the terminal pre-Islamic</page><page sequence="59">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 289 period, this pattern dissolved as the trade route passed south- ward to the sea, largely bypassing the interior Hadramawt. Thus, though causality has not been determined, available evidence points to a strong relationship between the fortunes of Hadramawt and its trade (ofluxury goods, in particular) with its closest neighbors in South Arabia. SESSION 5C: LATE ANTIQUITY REPOSITIONING THE GRAND CAMEE DE FRANCE: Elizabeth Marlowe, Columbia University For centuries, the historiography of the Grand Camee has focused narrowly on the possible configurations of the Julio- Claudian dynastic arrangements the monument is presumed to represent. Occasionally, scholars have also noted that the cameo bears certain iconographic features, such as the stubble beard and closely cropped hair of the central, seated figure, that are ill-suited to aJulio-Claudian milieu-only to dismiss these anomalies summarily as the result of later recarving. This paper attempts to consider the "anomalies" on their own terms, and offers two ways of thinking about them. If they are indeed evidence of late antique recarving (as proposed by H.Jucker), the cameo can be understood as an example of imperial "spo- liation," thereby providing a new and important parallel to better known examples of this enigmatic phenomenon. I also consider the possibility that the cameo itself dates to the late antique period, with the reign of Constantine providing the most plausible context. In addition to the military coiffure of the central figure (perhaps Constantine's father), his rather diadem-like "laurel wreath," and the wide, staring, incised eyes of all the figures, the mishmash of ethnographic details among the captive figures recalls the generic barbarians on Tetrarchic "VICTOR OMNIUM GENTIUM" coin reverses. Furthermore, the comparatively planar and blunt style of the carving has little in common with the cameo's ostensible sibling, the highly classicizing "Gemma Augustea." Regardless of whether or not one can ultimately prove a particular date, a rethinking of the cameo outside theJulio-Claudian "box" highlights many previ- ously underexamined aspects. CONSTANTIUS II (?) ON AN INCISED BONE PANEL FROM KENCHREAI: Wilma Stern, Pennsylvania State University Forty-one fragments of thin bone veneer were recovered, mainly in 1965, from an inundated apsidal room at Kenchreai, the Saronic Gulf port of ancient Corinth. They constitute part of apparently the largest and among the finest examples of late Roman bone reliefs, unique in containing internal evi- dence for a date in the 350s A.D. Surviving edge fragments support the reconstruction of a curved panel, about 60 cm across a straight base. The composition may depict an en- throned emperor (now headless) flanked by personifications of Rome and Constantinople and by pairs of attendants, with palm branches and a hydria at their feet. The hands of the attendants are draped, a practice thought to have occurred in the second century, but a documented part of court ceremo- nial in the reign of Julian (A.D. 361-363). The representa- tion is incised, with areas of drapery worked in intaglio for colored wax or resin inlays. Following the dedication of Constantinople in 330, medal- lions with a turreted and winged Constantinople were pro- duced there, and from 335-337 also at Rome until ceasing after Constans's annexation of Gaul in 340. Issues with Rome and Constantinople resumed, becoming a prominent feature of the vota coinage of Constantius II. It is proposed therefore that this emperor is represented on the Kenchreai bone panel, probably dating it to the 350s, prior to the destruction and abandonment of the furniture it decorated either before or during an earthquake of A.D. 365. THE BODY OF THE ATHLETE IN LATE ROMAN ART: Julie Van Voorhis, Indiana University The image of the athlete is ubiquitous in ancient Greece and Rome, and throughout much of its long history, this im- age was remarkably consistent. By the Hellenistic period, two models for the representation of athletes had emerged: heavy athletes, such as wrestlers, boxers, and pancratiasts, were gen- erally represented with muscular bodies based upon images of Herakles, while light athletes, such as runners, were repre- sented with lithe physiques that may ultimately derive from images of Hermes. While there is some flexibility within this framework, these two models continued to be used in the Roman visual repertoire, where they dominated well into the high Imperial period. A dramatic shift in the image of the athlete, however, occurred around the beginning of the third century C.E. At this time, the idealized body types of the past were abandoned in favor of a distinctly anticlassical athletic image thatwas characterized by squat proportions, thick, muscle- bound torsos, and small heads. The change in the Roman conception of the athletic ideal cannot be explained simply as a decline in the ability of artists to represent the human body or as the result of a general aesthetic trend toward abstraction. Rather, this change was clearly intentional, and it reflected changes in Roman percep- tions of professional athletes. This paper explores representa- tions of athletes in the visual arts within the broader context of contemporary athletic culture and commemorative prac- tices, in order to understand better the cultural circumstances behind the dramatic transformation of the athletic body dur- ing the late Imperial period. ANIMAL SPECTACLES OF THE LATE ROMAN EMPIRE: Chris Epplett, University of Lethbridge In general, Roman beast-hunts and animal spectacles (both commonly referred to as venationes by the ancient sources) have not received nearly as much scholarly attention as gladi- atorial spectacles. My paper addresses two particular aspects of the venationes that have been largely overlooked by scholars, the change in their nature over time and the factors leading to their eventual disappearance in Rome and Constantinople. The focal point of the debate concerning the demise of such events is a decree banning the venationes credited by a variety of sources to the emperor Anastasius. Unfortunately none of these sources contains many specifics about this de- cree, leading to debate among historians. Some scholars have argued that Anastasius, perhaps out of a concern for animal welfare, only banned venationes in which they were killed, leading to the emergence of nonviolent animal events featur- ing acrobatic displays by the human performers involved. Late imperial ivory diptychs, as well as contemporary literary refer-</page><page sequence="60">290 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ences, attest to the popularity of such spectacles. I argue, however, that whatever the exact nature of Anastasius's ban, animals continued to be slaughtered in Roman spectacles even after his death. There does not therefore appear to have been a revulsion against the killing of animals, as there was against the killing of gladiators in the later empire. Rather, I suggest, more mundane reasons were behind the ultimate disappear- ance of the venationes, namely increasing problems procur- ing the supply of animals necessary for such events. DIATRETUM OR KANISKION?: E. Marianne Stern, In- dependent Scholar, Toledo The Greek word kaniskion, "little basket," appears in a re- cently published fifth-century list of lamps. Montserrat identi- fies the type as an openwork lamp, but was unable to find any examples as early as the fifth century (Orientalia 64.3 [1995] 430-44). Eighth-century Latin sources mention a lighting device called canistrum. Both names evoke the interstices that characterize baskets woven of cane or reed. Roman openwork silver vessels, some preserving glass liners blown directly into them, still survive, but nothing is known of their use. The earliest openwork vessel identified as a lamp is in the Traprain Treasure; small flat-topped silver studs project inward from the openwork (fourth-early fifth century). This curious feature connects it with earlier, double-walled glass cage cups, the most sophisticated products of the late Roman glass industry. Many of these served as lamps (Whitehouse, JGS30 [1988] 28-33). They are usually called diatreta, because the openwork is thought to have been made by cutting and grinding. If Lierke's hypothesis is correct, that cage cups were made by pressing hot glass through a perforated mold (AntW 26.4 [1995] 251-69), the name diatretum is no longer appro- priate. Mold pressing would have obviated much of the labori- ous cold work. The idea to use a perforated mold was antici- pated by Roman glassblowers who blew glass liners directly into openwork metal vessels. The interstices of the cage cup evoke a kaniskion. I suggest the earliest openwork lamps called kaniskia were made of glass. IMAGE PROCESS: EVANG;ELIUJM, THE IDENTIFICATION OF A PALEO-CHRISTIAN FIGURE: Linda Sue Galate, Drew University The continuous construction of the early Christian cata- combs of Rome during a period of three centuries created spatial fields for decorative purposes that were physically re- stricted and geometrically nonconforming. As a result, a pro- cess seemed to develop within these burial grounds that pro- duced the abbreviated representation. The data evidence that an illustrated Biblical narrative (i.e., Jonah cycle, Lazarus narrative) rendered in several phases or as a complex representation was reduced to a singular compo- sition that contained its most essential elements. It may have included a figure, scene, or attribute alone or in combination. This imagery, depicted upon aflatplane, devoid ofbackground, could be positioned for pedagogical objectives due to its linear brevity most adaptable to the field shape irregularities of sub- terranean construction. Through this process, the most popular yet enigmatic image depicted in paleo-Christian art, the orant, can be identified as the First Witness, an illustration of the Resurrection narrative through the episode of the Good News (Evangelium). The com- plete composition, to date misidentified, destroyed, or lost, de- picts a standing, frontalfemale, generallyveiledwith outstretched arms and open palms flanked by two apostles who greet her with outstretched arms. Her signature gesture and stance were re- tained while the two apostles were eliminated, resulting in the abbreviated Evangelium representation. An iconographic stability was achieved through the repeti- tion of these abbreviated representations, which in turn helped solidify a symbol specific recognition of text on the part of the Christian observer. SESSION 5D: FUNERARY MONUMENTS IN THE ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN WORLDS IN THE MOUTH OF THE WOLF: Wayne L. Rupp, Jr., Florida State University A group of Hellenistic Etruscan cinerary urns depicts a scene long identified as the Etruscan king Porsenna exorcising the monster Olta. This scene shows a man-wolf hybrid rising out of a well surrounded by a group of men, who have chained him by the neck in an attempt to restrain him as he attacks. A kingly figure empties a patera over the man-wolf. The original inter- pretation is based on a passage in Pliny the Elder's Natural History 2.140 in which the Etruscan king Porsenna exorcises the monster Olta. This has been accepted by numerous schol- ars, such asJ. Elliott, E.H. Richardson, andJ.G. Szialgyi. This interpretation needs reevaluation because of a major flaw; Pliny makes no mention of the physical description of Olta as having lupine features. I argue that the scene on these urns may be interpreted as Faunus, a figure associated with prophecy, being subdued by a kingly figure, possibly Numa, and his men. This conclusion is based on literary and archaeological testimony that Faunus, in his earliest Italic incarnations, was originally a man-wolf hybrid and an episode in Ovid's Fasti 3.295-324, in which Numa at- tempts to coerce Faunus into teaching him how to expiate thunderbolts. In this passage, Numa gets Faunus drunk at a spring and chains him. Faunus fights to escape, Numa offers a sacrifice, and learns how to call onJupiter. First, the evidence of Faunus as a wolf-man will be provided, and then the urns will be discussed in relation to Ovid's narrative. VIVA FEC17T: WOMEN'S PATRONAGE AND FUNERARY MONUMENTS: KathrynJ. McDonnell, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Our best evidence for women's personal patronage of the arts during the Roman empire comes from dedicatory inscrip- tions. These inscriptions pertain primarily to two types ofmonu- ments: tombs and religious dedications. Examination of viva fecit funerary monuments, tombs commissioned by living women, demonstrates that female patronage does not trans- late into gendered iconography in the manner in which we might expect. Instead, funerary monuments dedicated by women to themselves alone and to themselves and family members typically emphasize socioeconomic status rather than gender. Examples drawn from the necropoli of Pompeii, Aquileia, and Ostia illustrate the consistency of these monuments with those dedicated by men and the variety of tactics used to emphasize the social position of the commissioner, including size, ornamentation, and location within the necropolis. The connection between status and viva fecit dedications is also indicated by the high percentage of these tombs that were</page><page sequence="61">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 291 built after the death of a prestigious spouse, a juncture at which women were concerned with maintaining as well as displaying their elite status. A few tombs in Pompeii, such as that of Eumachia and the two tombs of Naevoleia Tyche, underscore the relationship between status and funerary monuments by the unusual na- ture of the individual woman's social position and the corre- spondingly exceptional nature of her tomb. While viva fecit tombs from the necropoli of Ostia and Aquileia do differ from those from Pompeii, showing regional variations in their form and decoration, the overall pattern of dedications is similar. ROMAN FUNERARY MONUMENTS IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: Linda Maria Gigante, University of Louisville In 1911 R.C. Ballard-Thruston, a prominent Louisvillian, traveled to Italy to purchase antiquities for the community's cultural enrichment. While in Rome, he was taken to the newly completed Carmelite Church of Santa Teresa near the ancient Via Salaria. A fewyears earlier, when the site was being prepared for construction, subterranean tombs (columbaria) were discovered. Numerous grave goods, including marble cin- erara, terracotta lamps, and offering vessels, as well as epi- taphs, were extracted from the modest tombs and became the property of the Carmelites. With the assistance of an Italian agent, Ballard-Thruston purchased all the monuments, and in 1912 they were shipped in 28 crates to New York. In 1929 he donated the collection to the new Speed Museum in Louis- ville, along with photographs and documents pertaining to the purchase and transport. While select monuments were exhibited in the museum over the years, most of the objects remained in their shipping crates for more than four decades. Several pieces from the collection are now on display at the Speed and are the centerpiece of its Antiquities Gallery. This paper is the formal introduction to the scholarly com- munity of the Roman funerary monuments in the Speed Museum. I discuss the history of the acquisition, the site in Rome from which the objects came, and the various types of artifacts. Preliminary research indicates that the monuments from this necropolis, which appears to have been in use from the first century B.C. to the late second century A.D., consti- tute the largest collection in the United States. COMPENSATION AND A PAMPHYLIAN SARCOPHA- GUS: Georgina E. Borromeo, The RISD Museum, and Kent Severson, Conservator The conservation of a Pamphylian sarcophagus in The RISD Museum (acc. no. 21.074) provided a case study of the deci- sion-making process required by such a project. The sarcopha- gus, complete with lid, is one of only three known sarcophagi with Trojan War imagery. The front is carved with a scene of the battle between Hector and Achilles, followed by a repre- sentation of Achilles dragging Hector's body around the crenellated walls of Troy while Priam and Andromache look on. The back is decorated with a scene of Erotes hunting. Representations of male seasons emerging from acanthus leaves punctuate the corners. The deterioration of multiple campaigns of restoration compelled us to remove nearly all compensation (fills or restorations) and to reevaluate what compensation was necessary. A well-defined methodology for determining appropriate compensation does not currently exist for ancient sculptures, although recentwork aided us through comprehensive publi- cations. Ambitious conservation programs for important an- cient monuments, such as the Ara Pacis and the Parthenon, not only drew attention to new restoration methods and tech- niques, but also increased our awareness of the importance of careful documentation. The removal ofThorvaldsen's restora- tions on the pedimental figures from the Temple ofAphaia in Aegina and the recent work on the Telephos Frieze from Pergamon also influenced our decisions. Our thinking was further informed by relatively more well-developed method- ologies in architecture (as set forth in the 1964 Charter of Venice), ancient Greek ceramics, and Italian Renaissance panel painting. SESSION 5E: INFERRING SOCIAL DYNAMICS IN AEGEAN PREHISTORY WINE, RELIGION, AND SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION AT FOURNOU KORIFI (MYRTOS): Carol Hershenson, University of Cincinnati This paper reexamines the interpretation that the Prepalatial settlement at Fournou Korifi (Myrtos) was egalitarian. It is clear that the status of residents at this site was not as sharply defined as in some other contemporary settlements; never- theless the careful excavation and publication allow us to dis- cern subtle differences among the contents of the repeated architectural units that indicate social differentiation which may have been acutely clear to the inhabitants of Fournou Korifi (Myrtos). The unevenly distributed resources include the durability of the architecture itself and therefore its preservation, looms and other large-scale facilities for working wool, cooking appa- ratuses, certain types of vessels for the storage and manipula- tion of liquids that were apparently used for wine and possibly other fermented drinks, and recognizable religious objects. Moreover, the two architectural clusters with the largest total quantities of possessions seem to have been engaged in the serving and consumption of wine on a scale which must have included individuals outside a single family, and one of these two clusters was in firm possession of the only evidence for religion within the settlement. The same two clusters did not, however, hold any visible monopoly on the means of produc- tion at Fournou Korifi (Myrtos) in the Prepalatial period; in- deed religion seems to have been the only unique activity in either of the two architectural clusters with the most material goods. NEW WINDOWS ON THE MINOAN PORT SETTLE- MENT OF PETRAS IN EASTERN CRETE: David W Rupp, Brock University, and Metaxia Tsipopoulou, Greek Archaeological Service On a plateau on Hill I at Petras, to the east of Siteia in eastern Crete, there was a small Minoan palace in the Proto- and the Neopalatial periods with an extensive port settlement below. The archaeological finds and architectural remains from sector III of the port settlement demonstrate the complexity of the settlement's history from the Prepalatial through the Postpalatial periods. In EM III the settlement was spread over the rocky hillside. There are indications of some degree of communal planning in the layout and orientation of the EM III structures. The debris from the destruction and leveling of</page><page sequence="62">292 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 the structures on the plateau above in MM IA was dumped over the stumps of the earlier walls. At least one substantial house was constructed at the closest point to the palace in MM III. Early in LM IA a number of houses fronting on an open space were built over the dump. Unlike sector I of the settlement there is no indication of subsequent building or use from later LM IA until LM IIIA2 when a large square structure was constructed over the ruins. By the late 14th century B.C. the hill lacked habitation. The artifact assemblages from sector III testify to the rich- ness and diversity of the inhabitants' material culture. These new windows on the Petras port settlement point to the com- plexity of the sociopolitical interactions that led to the forma- tion and development of the palace here and to the radical changes which took place in Postpalatial society. THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF PRES- TIGE ARTIFACTS IN MYCENAEAN THEBES, GREECE: Anastasia Dakouri-Hild, Christ's Col- lege, Cambridge, U.K. Antonios Keramopoullos had referred to the Theban wealth economy in the context of gift-exchange as early as 1930, based on his discovery of the so-called House of Kadmos or old palace of Thebes. Since then, the excavations conducted by the ar- chaeological service on the palatial citadel have brought to light numerous important sites, which testify to the interest of the Theban elites in ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, alabaster, and other imported commodities. Moreover, it has become evident in more recent years that the palace invested in the production of elaborate artifacts, employing these exotic materials in combi- nation. In this paper, I explore the social dynamics of the production and consumption of prestige artifacts in Thebes. Such goods represented highly specific powers of acquisition in terms of raw material. I argue that they presupposed a degree of technical and ideological knowledge for their manufacture and assembly. They were produced within the palatial complex in a patron- craftsman working environment. Their circulation was controlled throughout the manufacture process, though not necessarily at the administrative level. Their production and consumption did not pertain to the economic realm only, but were cultural and cognitive processes as well. My main conclusions: (1) the pro- duction of these luxurious artifacts was monopolized by the Theban elites; (2) they constituted tokens of social value, as well as aesthetic and exchange value; and (3) their local and regional consumption was regulated, with a view to sumptuary exclusivity, commercial advantage, and the display of rank. THE EMERGENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL: THE BODY AND SOCIETY IN EARLIER CYCLADIC PREHIS- TORY: Tristan Carter, Stanford University The late EB I period witnessed a number of major innova- tions in Cycladic society, including the rise of long-distance voyaging and radical changes in the consumption of metals and obsidian. A simultaneous phenomenon that draws these themes together is the heightened significance accorded the body, with the burial record containing a range of materials for adornment, depilation, painting, and tattooing. While jew- elry, hairstyle, and body decoration would have expressed a person's position in society, these forms of modification were not passive, for they employed material culture that signaled access to restricted and exotic resources, whose procurement and manufacture embodied exclusive knowledge, both tech- nical and experiential. While locating the practice in contemporary sociopolitical dynamics, this interpretation does not explain why the body became such an important medium at this juncture; this paper addresses this problem. Arguably, one can suggest that the aforementioned habits were merely a late EB I fluorescence of a practice that origi- nates in the late fourth millennium. As such, one can reap- praise the issue in terms of a far more fundamental narrative, that of the emergence of the individual (cf. P. Treherne,JEA 3 [1995] 105-44). The distinction lies between the Late Neolithic ideology of communality (villages and collective cer- emonial/burial centers) and the transformation to an empha- sis on self-identity in Final Neolithic/EBA society (farmsteads and single inhumation cemeteries). The body was central to this new process, through the rise of individualized social rela- tions and as an arena for the accumulation and display of histories and goods. THE CEMETERY OF SPHOUNGARAS: NEW EVIDENCE FOR SOCIAL HIERARCHY IN MINOAN CRETE: Jeanette M. Cooper, SUNY at Buffalo In 1912, Edith H. Hall published the findings from the excavations of Sphoungaras in eastern Crete, directed by R.B. Seager. The excavations of 1910 revealed a cemetery that Harriet Boyd Hawes had connected with the settlement of Gournia in 1904. This paper reevaluates the cemetery based on new evi- dence from recent archaeological survey, Boyd's newly discov- ered notebooks, and a reexamination of the published mate- rial. The 1992-1994 Gournia survey collected large amounts of pottery from Sphoungaras and found that the cemetery extends several hundred meters further south than originally recorded. The artifacts published by Hall can now be dated much more precisely. The site of Sphoungaras is important partly because it en- hances our understanding of Gournia and partly because it features in ongoing discussions about the nature of social com- plexity in Early and Middle Bronze Age Crete. The first part of the paper presents the 1992-1994 pottery; describes the burial practices at Sphoungaras, including the use of previously unrecognized house tombs; and clarifies the cemetery's relationship with Gournia and other nearby sites. The second half of the paper compares the tombs at Sphoungaras to burials at Gournia, Mochlos, and Malia. On the basis of these comparisons, it is argued that the extent of social ranking in Early Minoan Crete has been exaggerated and that distinct signs of social hierarchy in the funerary mate- rial only begin in MM IA, after ca. 2000 B.C.E. ARCHITECTURE OF DISTINCTION: THE BUILT EN- VIRONMENT AND SOCIOPOLITICAL POWER IN LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS: Kevin D. Fisher, Uni- versity of Toronto The Late Cypriot period (ca. 1650-1050 B.C.) witnessed the emergence of urban centers such as Enkomi, Kition, and Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios that were characterized by the pres- ence of monumental religious, administrative, and/or domes- tic structures. These buildings are often viewed as indicators of highly developed sociopolitical and economic complexity and as reflections of the ability of elites to mobilize labor and</page><page sequence="63">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 293 material resources. While the events that take place within these structures, whether religious rituals or administrative activities, can be seen as central to the maintenance of elite power, the role of the architecture itself in the development of sociopolitical complexity has largely been ignored. Instead, considerations of Late Cypriot architecture have typically been preoccupied with stylistic, chronological, functional, and/or technological considerations. I examine the built environment of the Late Cypriot pe- riod from a different perspective-one which views buildings not as the static containers in which the social, economic, political, and religious activities of its occupants take place, but as active participants that play an integral and dynamic role in the production and reproduction of sociopolitical messages of power. "Public"/elite architecture from several Late Cypriot sites is analyzed using techniques derived from environment- behavior and space syntax studies. I demonstrate that through the manipulation of building layout and the strategic place- ment of architectural features such as ashlar masonry, built environments created by elites served to shape and maintain sociopolitical relationships and group identity during this im- portant period in the Cypriot past. SESSION 5F: COLLOQUIUM: RESEARCH, RE- PATRIATION, AND LOANS: MUSEUMS IN 2002 HERA, PAESTUM, AND THE CLEVELAND PAINTER: Jenifer Neils, Case Western Reserve University In 1930 the Cleveland Museum of Art acquired a large Attic red-figure column-krater from a dealer (Harold Parsons) who reported its findspot as Paestum. The following yearJ.D. Beazley dubbed it the name-vase of his newly created "Cleveland Painter." The vase has never received the attention it de- serves as a vase whose iconography can be related directly to its findspot. The komos, or revel, of four nude males on the re- verse is deliberately contrasted with the stately chariot proces- sion offour draped gods on the obverse. The gods, misidentified in previous scholarship, can be properly identified on the basis of a passage in the Iliad (720-32) which describes Hera, Hebe, and a chariot with an eight-spoked wheel. Since four-spoked wheels are the norm in Attic vase painting and this is the only eight-spoked wheel mentioned in all of Greek literature, the artist clearly heard and was influenced by the passage when he painted his multispoked chariot wheel. As a site with two large Doric temples and numerous other shrines as well as votive offerings dedicated to Hera Argiva, the goddess of fertility, Paestum in the Archaic and Classical periods was a thriving cult center of this goddess. It is therefore likely that avase uniquely celebrating her relationship with her daughter might have been a special commission by some Poseidonian who was a devotee of the city's most important cult. THE SCULPTURE COLLECTION FROM THE SANCTU- ARY OF DIANA NEMORENSIS AT LAKE NEMI IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY: Irene Bald Romano, University of Pennsylvania Museum Among the first acquisitions (in 1896) of the newly founded University of Pennsylvania Museum (UPM) was a collection of 45 pieces of sculpture from the Sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis on the shores of Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills. The site was explored from 1885 to 1895 by collaborators of the property owner, including the British ambassador in Rome, Lord Savile Lumley, and a series of Roman art dealers. While Lord Savile deposited his portion of the finds in the Castle Museum in Nottingham, the other sculptures from Nemi were put up for sale and purchased by the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen and the UPM. The portion in Copenhagen consists mostly of the large-scale imperial portraits, while that in Philadelphia com- prises mostly Late Republican votive statuettes, though also includes some Republican cult statue fragments and a set of inscribed marble vessels of early Imperial date. Danish scholars Mette Moltesen (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek) and Pia Guldager Bilde (Aarhus University) began some years ago to publish the entire corpus of sculptures from the Sanctu- ary of Diana Nemorensis, resulting in many excellent publica- tions. A project to reinstall the Roman Gallery at the UPM was the recent impetus for a scholarly reexamination of the Nemi material at our museum, for conservation of the material, and for a collaboration with the Danish scholars to carry out some further studies, including stable isotopic analysis to identify marble sources, and examination of painted surfaces. This pa- per will present the results of some of this recent research on the sculptures from the Sanctuary of Diana at Lake Nemi. DIoNYsos PATRON OF DRAMA ON A LATE ANTIQUE COPTIC TEXTILE: Susan H. Auth, The Newark Museum This paper deals with a depiction of the god Dionysos unique in Coptic art (Newark Museum 72.137; From the private col- lection of Dikran G. Kelekian, who "bought it from the exca- vators in Egypt before 1912") defined here as the art of Egypt, from the 4th-10th centuries A.D. After 600 years of Greek and Roman rule in Egypt, a notable feature of Coptic art of all media is its use of classical myths and motifs. Among many other themes, Dionysos and his retinue are the most com- mon, especially in the decoration of clothing. This red, green, and beige textile square, which ornamented a linen tunic, is unusual in showing Dionysos as the patron god of the theater. Despite its small size, only five inches square, it is remarkably specific in detailing the god's appearance and attributes. The seated, thyrsus-holding Dionysos rests his left arm on back-to- back masks of tragedy and comedy supported on a panther's head. Stylistic details, particularly the large square eyes, point to a fifth-century date. How did such an image of Dionysos survive into the late antique period in Egypt? Theatrical performances unified the Greek community in Egypt through the centuries. Many pa- pyrus fragments and even complete texts of Greek plays sur- vive, some from the third century A.C., annotated for perfor- mance. Greek poetry was being written in the fifth and sixth centuries in Egypt. Since clothing was often ordered from the weaver by the purchaser, it is tempting to surmise that this square was woven into a tunic made for a resident of late antique Egypt familiar with ancient Greek cultural traditions. A SECOND DEBUT: THE ALKMENE PAINTER'S HYDRIA IN READING: Ann Steiner, Franklin and Marshall College An important and recently rediscovered Attic black-figure hydria is an example of the tantalizing fruit yielded by collabo-</page><page sequence="64">294 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 ration between museums and archaeologists (Reading Public Museum 30-301-1; ABV282, 1). This paper presents the in- triguing history of the hydria's modern ownership and its unique iconography. The hydria was on the Roman art market in the mid 19th century and published in a drawing by Gerhard in 1840 (E. Gerhard, Auserlesene Vasenbilder [1840] pl. 94). Its location was unknown until 1993 when the author and a colleague began to study the antiquities at the Reading (Pa.) Public Museum. We have reconstructed its whereabouts from the 1850s-1930 when it was donated to the museum. Aware of Gerhard's drawing, Beazley attributed it to the Alkmene Painter (circle of the Antimenes Painter) to whom is attributed only one other vase, a hydria now in London (Lon- don B 301; ABV 282, 2). The two hydrias have so much in common they appear to be a matched pair. A striking feature of the Reading hydria is the composition of the main scene, where Herakles beats the supine lion with his club while step- ping on the lion's shoulder and holding it at the neck. A scheme similar to this unconventional formula appears only one other time on published vases, on a hydria by the Antimenes Painter (Wurzburg 306; ABV267, 14). The Read- ing hydria also proves the Alkmene Painter to be a subtle user of repetition to create temporal sequence of mythical events: Athena appears in distinct activities on shoulder and belly. The hydria isjust one example of many "old" vases waiting for rediscovery by archaeologists at Reading and elsewhere. THE FRANCAVILLA MARITTIMA PROJECT: PUBIACA- TION AND REPATRIATION: Marion True, The J. Paul Getty Museum In 1993, The J. Paul Getty Museum and the Institute for Classical Archaeology in Bern, Switzerland were contacted by a Dutch archaeologist, Prof. Marianne Maaskant ofGroningen, with information that both institutions included in their col- lections materials illicitly excavated at the site of Francavilla Marittima in Calabria. This paper will discuss the collaboration with the Italian Ministero per I Beni Culturali to form an international consortium of scholars to study the objects and to create a plan for repatriation. This group has now com- pleted a thorough documentation and analysis of these mate- rials. This work is to be published by the Ministry as a special supplement of the Bolletino d'Arte. The Institute in Bern has mounted a small educational exhibition on the initiative (De- cember 2000 to April 2001). At the end of the exhibition, the objects return to Italy, to the care of the archaeological mu- seum in Sibari. A more comprehensive exhibition on the his- tory of the site, which will originate in Sibari and travel to Bern and Los Angeles, is planned for a later date. The Francavilla Marittima project may serve as an illustration of how a poten- tially awkward situation can become a constructive research opportunity in which all partners have shared and benefited. U.S.-ITALY CULTURAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT: Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, U.S. State Department, Consulting Archaeologist On 19January 2001, the government of the United States of America and the government of the Republic of Italy signed an agreement, under the 1983 Convention on Cultural Prop- erty Implementation Act, to protect pre-Classical, Classical, and Imperial Roman archaeological material. Restricted arti- facts range in date from approximately the ninth century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. Categories include stone, metal, and ceramic sculpture; decorated vessels in metal and ceramic; metaljewelry; weapons and armor, and inscribed metal sheets; glass mosaic and sculpture; and wall painting. Objects listed in the Federal Register notice may enter the U.S. if they have an export permit issued by Italy or verifiable documentation that they left Italy prior to the effective date of the restriction: 23 January 2001. Although the primary purpose of the agreement is to pro- tect archaeological materials in situ from further pillage by reducing the incentive for looting, it also offers opportunities to engage in partnerships to help protect the cultural heritage of Italy and to enrich American cultural life. These opportuni- ties include long-term loans of objects for research or educa- tion programs, excavation projectsjointly proposed byAmeri- can museums, and academic exchanges and specific study pro- grams agreed upon between Italian and American institutions. SESSION 5G: COLLOQUIUM: RECENT WORK ON THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS ROCK-CUT NICHES AND VOTIVE SCULPTURE FROM THE SANCTUARY OF EROS AND APHRODITE ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF THE ACROPOLIS: Kevin Glowacki, Indiana University Early travelers to Athens in the 18th and 19th centuries called attention to the numerous rock-cut niches marking cult locations on the North Slope of the Acropolis. Apart from the Caves of Apollo and Pan, however, the divinities to whom any of these "rustic" shrines were sacred remained unknown until 1931, when Oscar Broneer discovered two inscriptions nam- ing Eros and Aphrodite. Broneer's excavations in the vicinity of the newly identified sanctuary highlighted the "popular" nature of the open-air shrine as a place for simple votive offer- ings and "bloodless sacrifices" to divinities of fertility, sexual- ity, and sexual healing. Based on a new examination of rock- cuttings on the North Slope and the unpublished sculpture from Broneer's excavations, this paper focuses on the niches within the sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite in order to shed more light on the range of votive offerings dedicated there. Special attention is given to evidence securing an object within a niche (e.g., figurines, statuettes). While precise dates for such rock-cut features are difficult to determine, the physical evidence from the sanctuary suggests that cultic activity began in the mid fifth century B.C. and continued into the Roman period. This range of dates is also consistent with the types of votive sculpture recovered by Broneer. New sculptural evidence includes several representations of Aphrodite and fragmen- tary votive reliefs. THE DATE OF THE NIKE TEMPLE PARAPET: Peter Schultz, University of Athens, Greece Arecently published photograph from the Balanos archives (D. Giraud, Me6lrl dnoxanraozrdoewS ro vaoi zic 'A8Oivd Nzix'c, [Athens 1994] pl. 97) illustrates the long-forgotten fact that the Pentellic marble cornice that crowned the sheathing of the Nike temple bastion served as part of the little temple's euthynteria. This cornice was also designed to support the</page><page sequence="65">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 295 Nike temple's parapet wall. Since the cornice was installed before the temple's crepidoma, it is clear that a marble parapet was integral to the Nike temple's design from the beginning of the construction process. The parapet is also mentioned as "T]ov p6'C aKTO[v" in a decree for a project on the Nike temple bastion, IG 13.64a. The reference to I]ov 8p6ticaKbO[v in IG 13.64a, however, has been consistently read as the "grille" for the Nike temple cella even though the word is never used to designate grilles in the epigraphic corpus. The only consistent use of the term is on Delos, where "Le terme de ip6UlaKTOC [the regular Delian derivative of the Attic 6p64aK~tO] designe une barriere, cl6ture ou balustrade, le plus souvent a claire- voie" (F. Salviat, "Dedicace d'un TPYIDAKTOZ par les Hermaistes Deliens," BCH87 [1963] 262). The parapet, with its crowning claire-voie metalwork, is the only object on the bastion that corresponds with the many marble balustrades collected by Salviat. IG 13.64a is dated by Lewis to ca. 430-420 and by Dinsmoor to ca. 427-424. The placement of the Pentellic cornice shows the parapetwas anticipated (and possi- bly decreed) beforethe construction of the temple proper, and Dinsmoor long ago proved that the parapet was not carved in situ. A starting date for the parapet before 421 B.C. seems probable and even likely given the massive influx of imperial tribute following the great reassessment of 425 B.C. THE ANCIENT TEMPLE ON THE ACROPOLIS AT ATH- ENS: Gloria Ferrari Pinney, Harvard University This paper concerns the Archaic temple ofAthena that was set on fire in the Persian sack of Athens, and its function in the monumental reconstruction of the Acropolis under Pericles. Most scholars believe that the temple was dismantled when the Erechtheum took over its function, although its western half may have survived until the fourth century. A new analysis of archaeological, epigraphical, and historical sources shows instead that, as D6rpfeld first argued, the temple remained standing into the Roman period (W. D6rpfeld, "Der Alte Athenatempel auf der Akropolis," AthMitt 12 [1887] 25- 51). At the core of the argument is a reinterpretation of the Chandler stele (IG 13.474), which gives an account of con- struction work, including references to the Erechtheum. In the heading of this inscription, the board of overseers has the title "epistatai of the temple on the Acropolis in which (is) the ancient statue." The analogy with the Thespieus amendment (IG 13.32) and the second decree of Callias (IG 13.52B) sug- gests that the temple in question is the Archaic temple. The reconstruction of the Erechtheum should be understood as part of the restoration of the arkhaios naos and of the Acropo- lis as a whole. Further, it is argued that the old temple was the centerpiece of an extensive choreography of ruins, other parts of which have been recognized for some time, and which is the background against which the Periclean buildings acquire their meaning. THE DOOR WALL OF THE PROPYLAEA CENTRAL BUILDING: Tasos Tanoulas, Ministry of Culture, Greece The transverse wall in the main building of the Propylaea on the Athenian Acropolis is pierced by five doors. Cuttings surviving on the doorjambs, on the doorsills, and on the lintels show very clearly that the openings of the doors were origi- nally framed by wooden elements and that, some time later, they were replaced by marble ones, traces of which still sur- vive. The cutting and the traces surviving on the wall provide sufficient information for the restoration of structural details of the sheathing of the door frames and their function. The careful observation of the wall blocks shows beyond any doubt that some of them were not perfectly adjusted when they were built in the wall, because the surfaces of the wall that were not to be covered by the door frames were to be smoothed later. Careful examination reveals also that the dam- ages on the jambs and on the lintel of the central door have not been produced by fire, as has been argued, but by the movement of the wall blocks caused by a cannonball that hit the northern half of the wall. THE CSA PROPYLAEA PROJECT: Harrison Eiteljorg, II, Bryn Mawr College The complexity of the Propylaea makes the study of the building very problematic. Relationships between parts-par- ticularly the difficult and important relationships between fin- ished parts and unfinished ones-are difficult to determine. Those relationships as well as other aspects of such a complex structure must be understood if the building as a whole is ever to be. The CSAPropylaea Project is an attempt to bring to students of this building the information necessary for such full under- standing. Drawings made by Tasos Tanoulas and his colleagues form the core. From them a fully three-dimensional, full-scale computer model of the Propylaea is being constructed. The drawings themselves are also being scanned to make them avail- able electronically. The model, the drawings, and scanned ver- sions of photographs will form a-unified digital resource provid- ing a complete factual base for any student of the building. The CAD model, being fully three-dimensional, makes it possible to consider the structure in all its complexity and to examine it from any angle, with or without any particular por- tion of the structure. The facts relating to a particular problem with the building can become clear with the aid of the model. The roof of the never constructed northeast wing probably terminated at its eaves in the wall of the northwest wing (Pinakotheka). If so, rain water from a portion of the roof had no escape. The model will provide the crucial evidence to approach this and other questions. SESSION 5H: WORKSHOP: ARCHAEOLOGI- CAL FIELDWORK IN ROME: PAST, PRES- ENT, AND FUTURE The purpose of the workshop will be to take stock of the current situation in Rome and to consider where the work at archaeological sites in and around the city is now headed and the new steps that may be required in order to further its development. This will involve both looking back on what happened during the course of the last century (that is, the history of the gains that were made in terms of field methods, documentation, research design, and organization) and look- ing forward to new methods and research strategies that will become common in this century. The workshop will be di- vided into two parts, each lasting about 90 minutes. In the first half, each of the invited participants will give a short presenta- tion (10 minutes at most) which examines a topic related to the speaker's own experience in Rome. The topics thatwill be</page><page sequence="66">296 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 covered include: (1) the contribution of coring, (2) the his- tory of excavation in Rome, (3) publication trends, (4) big digs in the Imperial fora, (5) new fieldwork at the Theater of Pompey, (6) working in the city versus the countryside, (7) theory and practice in the 1990s, and (8) the take-off in the early 1980s. The second half of the workshop will be given over to the open discussion of different points of view. Those in the audi- ence will be encouraged to take part in the discussion. The themes we wish to discuss will fall under three main headings: (1) new field methods and strategies and how to incorporate them effectively in field projects, (2) the contrast between what is done at sites in the city and what occurs at those in the countryside (their respective advantages and challenges and the dialogue between the two contexts), and (3) the ques- tion of publication. The workshop will provide an opportunity to define turning points in the history of fieldwork in Rome, to look critically at contemporary issues, to identify emerging trends, and to reflect upon competing priorities. The aim is to generate a wide-ranging discussion that will throw new light on where we stand today and on what needs to be done in coming years.

Lesk, University of Cincinnati For the first 50 years of the last century, several prominent archaeologists tried to discern an "original" plan for one of the most controversial buildings of the High Classical period, the Erechtheion. D6rpfeld and Dinsmoor are just two of those experts who published symmetrical solutions for what they believed must have been the original plan of the building. Harriet Boyd Hawes, though more famous for pioneering American excavations on Crete, also wrote a treatise on the riddle of the Erechtheion. Her daughter, Mary Allsebrock, has kindly given me permission to bring her mother's unpub- lished manuscript to light. This paper discusses Hawes's inno- vative approach and independent solution to what she calls the Erechtheion's "preposterous plan" and places it in its his- toriographic context. Hawes researched the problem for over three decades, incorporating the seminal work on the Erechtheion by Paton, Caskey et al., and corresponded with Dorpfeld and Dinsmoor, whose comments on her research are preserved in the margins of the manuscript and in letters. This paper also examines the reception of the Erechtheion in the light of contemporary intellectual and architectural theory, exposing these archaeologists' obsession with symmetry and their conviction that the ancient Athenians were too rational a civilization to have produced a building as complex and radi- cal as the Erechtheion. Hawes's contribution to the contro- versy promises to be a valuable addition to the legacy of this puzzling building's impact on archaeology and architecture. A BADLY RESTORED SCULPTOR'S NAME IN THE ERECHTHEION AcCOUNTS: John D. Morgan, Uni- versity of Delaware Stephen D. Lambert (ZPE 132 [2000] 157-60) has recently observed that the names of some of the sculptors who were paid for a group of figures in the frieze of the Erechtheion, as recorded in the inscribed accounts of 408/7 B.C. (IG 13.476), recur as the names of several recipients of payments recorded on IG22.1654, and hence that IG22.1654 should be dated not in the early fourth century, but around 405 B.C., as Dinsmoor had contended (HSCPh Suppl. [1940] 157-82). In lines 1-8 of IG 22.1654 each sculptor is named in the accusative case, fol- lowed by his demotic if he was an Athenian citizen, or the deme in which he resided if he was a metic. Hence in line 2 the letters AAMONANA should be from the end of a sculptor's name and the beginning of his demotic or deme of residence. Koehler's tentative restoration of [] I [p]d46pova Nc [---- ] has been accepted without question ever since his initial publica- tion of this fragment (IG 21 [1883] no. 845), but Opdp1lov was an extremely rare name, and no Athenian deme or demotic began with Na-. My restoration of [E] I [K] .pov 'Ava[Kat~a] permits the identification of this sculptor with the paternal grandfather of EGcKacpog 'AvaKaECtiq, the d'vaypaw+Etq in 319/8 B.C. (Agora 16 [1997] no. 101). Moreover, the great rareness of the name E{fKaSpog in Attica and elsewhere makes virtually certain my identification of this sculptor EiKcQxPlo0 'AvaKcIEctq, who worked on the Erechtheion ca. 405 B.C., with the sculptor EuiKcaPOqo, whose pac0qxifq, the Athenian sculp- tor'AvSpo(j0vvqq, completed the figures in the pediments of the fourth-century temple ofApollo at Delphi (Paus. 10.19.4), apparently in 327 B.C. (J. Bousquet, BCH108 [1984] 695-8). EXCLUSIVISM AND RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS IN EARLY HEILLENISTIC TIMES: Ralf von den Hoff Ludwig-Maximilians- Universitit, Munich, Germany Greek sanctuaries were focal points of collective identities, changing due to historical and cultural circumstances. In this sense, the Athenian acropolis during the first decades of po- litical dependence under Macedonian occupation after 323 B.C.E. should be of more interest than recent studies suggest. Leaving aside Demetrios Poliorketes' and Lachares' singular acts of impiety, the epigraphical, sculptural, and literary sources concerning the acropolis of this period reveal more common patterns of behavior and interests concerning the religious center of the polis. For kings, donations supporting the Panathenaia and dedications of weapons were key occasions to present themselves as "liberators." But evidence for honor- ary royal portraits on the acropolis is lacking after 323. Indeed, no statues of foreigners at all appear until 229, in contrast to what we find in the Athenian agora. Instead, honorary statues of native Athenians holding high positions after 323 become common on the acropolis. Votive statues tend to represent even cult officials, who have not heretofore been depicted. They demonstrate the tradition and outstanding religious role of influential families, like the Eteobutadai. Meanwhile, ex- cept from attaching votive-shields to the Parthenon, the sanctuary's architecture remained untouched as monument of Athens's past. The acropolis is witness that Athens's politi- cal dependence produced a growing necessity to define a dis- tinct, exclusive polis identity with Athena's sanctuary as its center. Continuing a fourth-century development, the loss of</page><page sequence="67">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 297 political independence made tradition and religion a focus of Athenian interests. THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF EMPIRE: ATHENS AND CRETE IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C.: Brice Erickson, University of Texas at Austin A decline of imports in the Cretan archaeological record ca. 460-400 B.C. has a direct bearing upon the question of fifth- century Cretan isolation. A clear pattern emerges from my study of the unpublished record of overseas ceramic imports on Crete. A uniform import gap interrupts the sequence ca. 460-400 B.C. at every investigated Cretan polis and sanctuary. Current evidence is sufficiently weighty and demonstrates enough internal consistency to warrant tentative historical conclusions. While any explanation is likely to involve a com- plex of factors, evidence suggests that the Athenians took action to isolate the Peloponnesians from North African grain sources by the time of the First Peloponnesian War. According to this interpretation, Crete, as a key stopping point along this major Peloponnesian trade artery, suffered. It can be inferred from Thucydides (4.53-54) that the Athenians attacked and fortified Kythera in order to disrupt this enemy trade route by the middle of the fifth century. An Athenian expedition launched against the Kydonians in 429 B.C. (Thuc. 2.85.5) might be understood in the same terms. Forcibly keeping Crete on the margins would have served Athenian strategic interests by disrupting the North African-Peloponnesian grain route. Accordingly, Athens's defeat at the end of the Peloponnesian War conceivably permitted a reestablishment of trade connections with the outside world. Further investi- gation of the import record from areas both within and out- side Athenian control hold promise for a better understand- ing of the role of economic considerations in the operation of the Athenian arche. URBAN BEES: Susan I. Rotroff Washington Univer- sity in St. Louis Several nearly complete terracotta beehives have been unearthed in the Agora Excavations (Athens), ranging in date from the fifth century B.C.E. to the first century C.E. Recent reexamination of context pottery from Hellenistic deposits has revealed that the beehive was a more common household item than had formerly been imagined. This reexamination retrieved a fragment of a hitherto un- documented hive type. Most hives have a solid floor and walls, with a flight hole in a separate cover, while the flight hole of this new vessel is located in its floor. This would have enabled the beekeeper to tend the hive from behind (opposite end from that through which the bees entered) and thus to cause less disturbance to the bees. This conforms with ancient in- structions for beekeeping (Pliny NH 11.10.24; Columella de re rustica 9.15.5-6). The large number of hives at Athens suggests that apicul- ture was commonly practiced within the city. Honey was the most powerful sweetener available, and it was expensive. A single hive could provide a supply of this valuable food at minimal cost. Hives could have been placed in courtyards, built into house walls, or hung beneath eaves, as they are in other parts of the world today. The earliest hives at the Agora date to the end of the fifth century. Possibly beekeeping entered the city when the rural population withdrew within the city walls during the Peloponnesian War. Once its feasibility was proven, the prac- tice continued. WHERE WAS THE SHRINE OF HERAKLES ALEXI- KAKOS?: Gerald V Lalonde, Grinnell College Few ancient Athenian shrines have so intrigued and eluded topographers as that ofHerakles Alexikakos. Scholiasts called it a very conspicuous shrine in the deme Melite, and scholars have variously identified it: the "Theseion,"-Hephaisteion- (Wachsmuth); southwest of the Areopagos (Frickenhaus); Pnyx (Judeich). Pittakis was the first to put it on the east spur of the Hill of the Nymphs, certainly in Melite, but chiefly because he thought that the healing cult of Haghia Marina on this rock descended from that of Herakles. Much later, the Agora Exca- vations yielded key evidence in an inscription (I 1749) record- ing the confiscation of"two workshops in [Melite ... bounded] on the south [by the] road leading from the shrine of Herakles Alexikakos to the Agora." Wycherley identified this road as one leading from the Agora westward up along the east spur of the Hill of the Nymphs and concluded that the shrine was on the eastern slope of the Nymphs' Hill, later modifying the location as "between the Hill of the Nymphs and the Pnyx." Most re- cently Binder andJameson have opted for the east spur of the Nymphs Hill, adding the evidence of Herakles reliefs found in the area. The present paper reinforces this siting of the Herakleion by demonstrating that the rupestral markers on the same hillside, IG 13.1055A (Horos Dios &lt;-) and B (Horos) by no means make a boustrophedon text. 1055B is a deme horos refer- ring to the adjacent road as the boundary between Melite to the north and Kollytos to the south. Thus, the shrine of Herakles Alexikakos is to be sought on the north side of this road, and here the upper tier of the shrine of Zeus on the east spur of the Nymph's Hill offers a most conspicuous site with rock-cut foundations suitable for the Herakleion. SESSION 6B: REMOVED SESSION 6C: MATERIAL STUDIES IN AEGEAN PREHISTORY REGIONAL DIVERSITY IN EARLY BRONZE AGE AEGEAN DIADEMS: Jane Hickman, University of Pennsylvania Gold and silver diadems first appear in the Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Over 50 diadems can be identified from Crete, the Cyclades, mainland Greece, and the Troad. Although most diadems are from burial contexts, some are assigned to hoards recovered from settlement sites. A wide variety of decorative motifs, sizes, and shapes are employed in diadem manufacture, as evidenced by a stylistic analysis ofAegean diadems completed by the author. In some cases, similarities in design exist between diadems and deco- rated ceramics from the same time period and location. Inspi- ration for some Aegean diadems may also be found injewelry from Mesopotamia and the Near East. Scholars note the regional diversity of EBA Aegeanjewelry. This study of diadems supports that conclusion, with distinct differences in length and decoration apparent in Crete, the Cyclades, and the Troad. Variation can also be identified in the choice of raw material, quality of workmanship, find context, and complexity of form (such as in the use of attachments).</page><page sequence="68">298 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 Evidence from Crete may indicate the ritual "killing" of diadems before placement in the grave. Although diadems appear in all regions of the Aegean during the EBA, local preferences lead- ing to regional diversity are suggested by differences in the design, manufacturing, and deposition of these objects. NEW EVIDENCE FOR THE THRONE ROOM FRESCO AT KNOSSOS: Elizabeth Shank, Temple University The Throne Room at Knossos, excavated in 1900 by Sir Arthur Evans, has been viewed as a symbol not only of a ruler, but also of central authority in Palatial Crete. This conclusion is based on the architecture of the room and the elaborate fresco which adorned its walls. Fragments of this fresco were found adhering to the north wall, beside the throne, and collapsed onto the floor. The first complete reconstruction of the wall painting was executed by Emile Gillieron in the early 1900s. His recon- struction is characterized by heraldic, wingless griffins in a Nilotic landscape with reeds and papyrus. Stylistically, this re- construction presents a rather static, symmetrical composition, similar to other compositions known from Crete in the LM II and LM III periods. Other reconstructions have been pro- posed by Mark Cameron, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, Maria Shaw, and John Younger, in attempts to more clearly depict the north wall, or the area of the throne. The development of a camera that uses infrared and ultra- violet light to view painted materials has revealed new details of the Throne Room fresco. Previously unpublished and hith- erto unknown elements in the fresco include diagonal, over- lapping reeds and the crest or wing of a griffin. These results allow a new reconstruction of the fresco which alters our per- ception of the Throne Room itself. MINOAN ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS: EVIDENCE FOR DRESS OR POTTERY DECORATION?: Bernice R. Jones, Queens College Anthropomorphic terracotta vessels with female attributes, dated from Early Minoan I to III, are decorated with designs that scholars including Warren (Antichita Cretesi 1973) and Gesell (Minoan Society 1983) believe represent clothes and garment patterns. Although such interpretations are tempting, espe- cially given the lack of evidence for dress in this period, there is little evidence to support them. Since it is identical in shape and decoration to Pyrgos ware, there is little to sustain Warren's identification of an EM I clay kernos from Pyrgos as a dressed figure of the "Great Goddess of Nature." Even the banded decoration on the EM III vessel from Mallia, identified by Warren as a woven jacket like modern Greek ones and by Branigan (Foundations ofPalatial Crete 1970) as a cloakworn over shoulders and body, finds identical parallels on Vasilike ware, and is thus unrelated to dress. My research (conducted for my doctoral dissertation) further reveals that all of the designs thought to represent garments that decorate the anthropomorphic vessels from Koumasa and Myrtos of EM II, and Mochlos and Archanes ofEM III are standard motifs on contemporary pottery. As on pottery, so on the anthropomor- phic vessels, the arrangement of the motifs emphasizes the shape of the vessel rather than the portrayal of clothing. Fi- nally, the blocky shapes of the anthropomorphic vessels also relate more closely to those of pottery than to dress. POTTERY OF THE LATE MINOAN III PERIOD AT MOCHLOS, CRETE: A PRELIMINARY REPORT: Rob- ert Angus K. Smith, Bryn Mawr College In 1986, rescue excavations conducted by the Greek Ar- chaeological Service exposed part of a substantial Late Minoan III cemetery near the ancient settlement of Mochlos. From 1989 to 1994, ajoint Greek-American project continued exca- vations of the settlement as well as the cemetery. In 1998, excavation of the cemetery continued, once again under the direction of the Greek Archaeological Service. These excava- tions uncovered Late Minoan III structures built atop and against earlier architecture, tripled the number of excavated tombs in the cemetery, and exposed a nearby farmhouse that survived into Late Minoan III. Ceramic remains from the excavations show that the Mochlos region did not remain unoccupied for very long after the destructions in Late Minoan IB. Although much of the Late Minoan III settlement appears to have been disturbed by Hellenistic occupation as well as Richard Seager's excavations of 1908, it has been possible to isolate at least nine separate structures and two distinct occupational periods at Mochlos and the isolated farmhouse at Chalinomouri. In the nearby cemetery, 30 tombs contained over 250 whole or nearly com- plete vessels. The evidence shows that beginning as early as Late Minoan IIIA1, and lasting until Late Minoan IIIB, Mochlos not only continued a tradition of local pottery production, but also interacted with Palaikastro, central Crete and Knossos, Khania, and even the Greek mainland. BEYOND MYCENAEAN DECORATED: THE LATE HELLADIC I POTTERY OF THE ARGOLID AND KORINTHIA:Jeffrey L. Kramer, University of Cin- cinnati Previous studies of pottery labeled "Late Helladic I" have focused almost exclusively on the Mycenaean decorated ex- amples despite the widespread recognition that numerous other fine wares-and, indeed, other wares in general-ex- isted concurrently. In fact, during the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age on the Greek mainland, Mycenaean deco- rated pottery comprised a tiny fraction of the total pottery assemblage as studies at Korakou and Tsoungiza have demon- strated. In this paper, I add to these reports my analysis of the Late Helladic I material from the recently excavated Lower Terraces of Midea. In addition and in contrast to previous studies, I integrate this material with the aforementioned stud- ies of Korakou and Tsoungiza as well as the pottery from settle- ment contexts at Asine and Lerna. From this, I sketch a rough picture of the nature of Late Helladic I pottery-both Mycenaean decorated and the other wares-from the Argolid and Korinthia. EAST OF MOUNT PELION: MYCENAEAN CENTAURS AT UGARIT: lone Mylonas Shear, AIA, Princeton Society M.L. West in his book TheEastFace ofHelicon demonstrated that Greek literature preserved traditions originating in the prehistoric Near East. Although this book has been widely accepted, the corollary that this same Greek literature pre-</page><page sequence="69">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 299 served traditions of the Mycenaean period has been treated with disbelief by most scholars. In support of this latter view I present this Mycenaean figurine of a Centaur, a mythological creature known in later Greek literature but one which was absent in the ancient Near East. Amid the Mycenaean objects found in Late Bronze Ugarit, there was this fragmentary terracotta figurine of a Centaur. The preserved legs and body have the shape of a Mycenaean quadruped, but in place of the circular neck of the bull or the thick, triangular neck of a horse, something quite different was portrayed. There rises from the body a thin, rectangular section which was meant to represent the torso of a male, human body. The sides of the rectangle were bent slightly forward to represent the arms on either side of the torso. The arms were further differentiated by a change in decoration. The upper part is broken and unfortunately the head is miss- ing. Centaurs of the Mycenaean period have not been found on the Greek mainland, but the shape of the legs, the color, and the decoration of this figurine from Ugarit reveal its Mycenaean origin. The Mycenaean vases found in Ugarit sug- gest the figurine should be dated to LH IIIA or LH IIIB. SESSION 6D: SOCIAL STATUS AND DAILY LIFE AT POMPEII THE PROBLEM WITH TRIMALCHIO FROM AN ART HISTORIAN'S PERSPECTIVE: THE CASE OF THE HOUSE OF L. CAECILIUS IUCUNDUS IN POMPEII (5.1.26): Lauren Hackworth Petersen, University of Delaware Mention the word "freedman" to anyone with more than a passing interest in Roman social history, and the fictional char- acter Trimalchio, an ex-slave in Petronius's Satyricon, will likely come to mind. This paper exposes the ways in which scholars have invoked Trimalchio as a way to understand the lives of historical freedmen and challenges scholars' portrayal of his- torical freedmen as being Trimalchio-like, that is to say, pre- tending to a status they could not have, and lacking in self- awareness about their limited standing in society. Using a case study approach, this paper specifically looks at the Pompeian house that belonged to L. Caecilius lucundus, a freedman in most scholarly accounts and thus subject to comparison with Trimalchio. However, rather than using the literary stereo- type of the freedman to come to an understanding of the house, my method examines the ways that the house and its painted and sculptural decoration appealed to ancientviewers in representing the Caecilius family. What emerges from this analysis is that the house, decorated over more than one gen- eration, inscribes the family's servile history in no uncertain terms while also presenting the owners as belonging to a Ro- man familia and as full Roman citizens. Although the Caecilii were limited by their social standing, and could not present themselves as the elite did, they did respond in creative ways to the limitations that elite society imposed on them. URBANIZATION AND INEQUALITY AT POMPEII: Rick Jones, University of Bradford, U.K. Ever-intensifying social inequality characterized Insula VI. 1 at Pompeii as the urban space was transformed into the densely occupied pattern of the city of 79 C.E. New research presents a rigorous archaeological perspective on social change at Pompeii. Finely detailed evidence shows the development of occu- pation from the fourth century B.C.E., including new light on the growth of the city's street system. Following ephemeral traces of earth and timber structures aligned on the Via Consolare, masonry buildings were erected from the third cen- tury B.C.E. Gradual intensification of use took place through the second century. The area was filled with closely packed properties, on a pattern that survived to the end of Pompeii. Alongside residential properties, commercial and industrial activities lined the Via Consolare. Sulla's attack on the city in 89 B.C.E. interrupted develop- ment. Afterwards, sharper inequalities appeared. The area pre- viously occupied by three modest residences was taken over by the much-extended House of the Vestals. In the mid-first century this was an axially planned atrium-peristyle house, extended to abut the city's defenses. Meanwhile commercial activities resumed alongside. Increasing social inequalities became more visibly pro- nounced when the House of the Vestals was comprehen- sively remodeled early in the first century C.E. Family and service areas were more sharply separated within a house of even more lavish decoration. Conspicuous display marked the House of the Vestals. While the elite enjoyed their en- hanced extravagance, their neighbors had to squeeze in- creasingly tightly into the commercial properties alongside. ROMAN DOMESTIC FACADES AND THE ARCHITEC- TURE OF INTERFACE: Jeremy Hartnett, University of Michigan The facades of Roman houses separated two vastly differ- ent spaces. Inside this interface, Roman domestic space was hierarchically ordered; through architecture and social ritual, it spotlighted the house's owner and showed visitors their relative status. Outside, by contrast, the street was more in- clusive and less predictable. The entire social spectrum came into spontaneous face-to-face contact in this neutral turf, threatening social boundaries and making the outward ex- pression of status critical. This paper, drawing on literary and archaeological evidence from Roman Italy, discusses how fa- cade architecture mediated between the owner-centric inte- rior and the socially-contested exterior. The intimate connection between a house and its owner's dignitas lent facade architecture a key role in the claims and counter-claims of status in the street, since it presented a physical statement about the owner. Pompeii's Casa del Fauno, for example, through a system of pilasters and lateral ledges, illustrates two common goals of self-presentation through house facades: presenting a unified architectural entity, and demarcating the house's extents (in this case, a whole in- sula). Facade elements also hinted at interior features: regu- lar efforts to highlight a house's main door served, I argue, as a kind of architectural shorthand for the presence of an atrium complex. A final example-where one viewer parodied a Pompeian facade with a graffito inside its entranceway-further ques- tions the division our scholarship has drawn between "the in" and "the out" in the Roman city, and invites us to reconsider how architectural messages affected people moving through Roman urban space.</page><page sequence="70">300 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 RESIDENCES FOR THE RICH? A STUDY OF THE SO- CIAL GEOGRAPHY OF REGIO VI OF ANCIENT POMPEII: Astrid V Schoonhoven, University of Leiden, The Netherlands From the second century B.C.E. a period of continuous growth of private wealth in Pompeii resulted in the creation of many large and luxurious residences. Regio VI, in the north- west part of the city, is traditionally characterized as the part of Pompeii that houses most of these "residences for the rich." Recent studies drop this characterization of Regio VI as a par- ticularly elitist, residential area in favor of a pattern of mixed land use throughout the city. This conclusion follows from the application of certain statistical techniques that quantify the distribution of different unit types in 79 C.E., the year of the destruction of the city. The attested distribution patterns have been silently assumed to have continued through the many centuries of Pompeii's existence. This study of the urban ar- rangement of Regio VI seeks to reconstruct the original plot- division of the houseblocks of the area, in order to examine the distribution of the plot types when the region was first arranged. What becomes clear is that originally the area was mainly intended for residential use, with commerce and industry only marginally represented. Different types of houseplots that were clearly meant for different social groups were mixed in an apparently deliberate way. The pattern of original distribu- tion shows a distinctive social geography. Houseplots of differ- ent scales and status were purposefully situated in specific areas, most likely through the agency of the city officials of the time. FOOD AND DRINK IN ANCIENT POMPEII: Robert I. Curtis, University of Georgia, Betty Jo Mayeske, University College, University of Maryland, and Robert L. Vann, University of Maryland Three principal investigators, three support staff, and two groups of 16 Earthwatch volunteers spent one month in Pompeii investigating patterns of daily life associated with food and drink. This year's work was the first of an estimated four summers to be devoted to the study of the utilization of urban space to accommodate public facilities devoted to food stor- age, processing, distribution, sale, and consumption and to relate them to private houses. The first goal is to determine what spatial relationships existed among themselves and be- tween them and the gates and street network, and, from this, deduce any evidence for urban planning. The second goal is to discover what these spatial relationships tell us about Pompeian social and economic life. This summer we concentrated efforts in Region VI, where we sought to locate any storehouses, shops, taverns, inns, and public and private houses with facilities to process food, such as bakeries, kitchens, and grape and olive presses. Among the houses investigated were the Houses of the Faun, of the Vettii, of the Golden Amorini, of the Labyrinth, of the Prince of Naples, of Meleager, of Pansa, of Sallust, and the InsulaArriana Polliana. Public facilities included the cauponaat Reg. VI.x.1/ 19 and six bakeries. We plotted distances among these enti- ties to discover their spatial relationship, and investigated food and drinkwithin private houses to discover relationships among rooms of the house devoted to different aspects of food and drink and other parts of the house. SESSION 6E: THE POST-CLASSICAL WORLD: CHANGE AND CONTINUITY TROY AFTER ANTIQUITY: THE LATE BYZANTINE OC- CUPATION: Kathleen M. Quinn, University of Cin- cinnati Recent excavations in the Greek and Roman levels of an- cient Troy have yielded evidence concerning the sanctuary on the southwest side of the mound. Believed to have been dedicated to the Samothracian Gods, it has produced material dating from the eighth century B.C. through the third cen- tury A.D. A hiatus of approximately 900 years follows, and then an unexpected wealth of Byzantine material which points to extensive use of the area-no longer a sanctuary-after classi- cal antiquity. In this paper, I examine the evidence for this Late Byzan- tine (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) use of the sanctuary area and in- clude a discussion of the stratigraphy, architecture, ceramics, and small finds. Three buildings survive which point to the secular role the area played in the Byzantine period. The first is a rectangular, three-room building containing evidence for the presence of horses. The second building, apsidal in shape, is associated with the use or production of glass objects. A third structure now mostly robbed out, overlaid Temple A, a monu- mental structure belonging to the Greco-Roman sanctuary. Analysis of the ceramics found in these contexts indicates a strongly regional focus at this time, although some imports from Constantinople are suggestive of trade contacts. From the evidence gathered above, I argue that the Byzan- tine occupation of Troy was relatively short-lived, encompass- ing perhaps a period of only 100 years. The result is the first synthetic study of the Byzantine levels at Troy, addressing issues of Christian use of pagan religious spaces after antiquity. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH IN JORDAN: W. Harold Mare, Covenant Seminary This paper will present evidence for the developing ancient ChristianJordan and for the churches of the Decapolis, particu- larly of the churches of Pella, Gadara, Abila, Gerasa, and Phila- delphia. The evidence given will center on the extensive physi- cal remains of these Jordanian churches. In Abila, Pella, and Gerasa, in particular, there are remains ofa number of churches, indicating that in the Byzantine period the spread of Christian- ity here was extensive. The architectural design and artistic embellishment of the churches vary from place to place. Some church structures had single apses, and some were triapsidal, but all invariably positioned on the east segment of the churches. On occasion the church basilicas were cruciform in structure, as in the case of the Abila cruciform cathedral. A number of the basilicas were revetted with marble. The floors of the churches were covered with mosaics or with opus sectilepavers. The roofs were covered with ceramic tiles, and the structures frequently had glass windows. In the Byzantine period the Christian Church inJordan expanded and flourished. A SIXTH-CENTURY ITALIAN MONASTERY: SAN SEBASTIANO AT ALATRI: Elizabeth Fentress, Uni- versity College London, U.K. Built on the shoulder of a hill overlooking the wide valley of Alatri in Southern Latium, the abbey of S. Sebastiano has</page><page sequence="71">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 301 changed very little in the last 500 years. For the past two years a small team has been investigating the standing structures of the abbey, reconstructing the stratigraphy of the standing walls and tracing the various phases through the building. This paper addresses the sixth-century phase. The abbey was founded by the praetorian prefect of Gaul, Liberius, in the beginning of the sixth century, under the guidance of a deacon, Servandus. The valley lies on the route between Subiaco and Montecassino, and it was probably here that Saint Benedict, passing through the valley several years later, made the acquaintance of Servandus, who became a visitor at Montecassino and witnessed one of Benedict's miracles. A surprising amount of the sixth-century abbey re- mains encased with later buildings. A triconch martyrium, or, perhaps, the hypogeum of the first abbot, remains to testify to this first period of the abbey's life. We have evidence for a church, probably with a square-ended presbytery to the east, of the same dimensions as the later 12th-century church. In front of it rose a high, porticoed narthex, with three great arched doors on both its eastern and western sides, two win- dows opening to the south, and, probably, an entrance to the north. An east-west corridor linked the narthex to a second structure, identical to it in plan and volume. The abbey presents the only known complete example of early sixth-century monastic architecture in Europe. The gram- mar of the buildings-church, narthex, hall, courtyard, and tomb--is of course a familiar one. It is the way in which the separate elements are put together which makes it recogniz- able as a monastic complex rather than as a villa among whose dependencies was found a church. CONSTRUCTION WORKSHOPS AND ARTISTIC ATE- LIERS OF THE FRANKISH-PERIOD (13TH CEN- TURY C.E.) ARCHITECTURE OF GREECE: Heather E. Grossman, University of Pennsylvania This paper examines the architecture built and adapted in 13th-century C.E. Greece as a means of discovering atelier practices and the transmission of architectural knowledge in a post-conquest society. Following the Fourth Crusade, knights from France and northern Italy settled in the Peloponnesos, beginning a period of interaction with Byzantine Greeks. New and extant ecclesiastical structures built or adapted during the so-called Frankish domination of Greece have been classified by past scholars, including Antoine Bon (La Morie Franque: recherches historiques, topographiques et archologiques sur la principaute d'Achaie (1205-1430), [Paris 1969]) and Beata Panagopoulou (Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medi- eval Greece, [Chicago 1979]), into the categories of "Gothic/ Western" and "Byzantine," based primarily upon the struc- tures' plan typologies and ornamentation. This taxonomy im- plies that the architecture of the medieval West was imported wholesale into Greece by the Latin conquerors. These catego- ries also suggest singular, ethnically-based points of origin for architectural elements. I first present new comparanda from France and Italy for plan types and architectural features, including architectural sculpture. In some cases the Greek elements and their usage remain close parallels, though in others the features have been adapted for their new context. Next I demonstrate likely ateliers of craftsmen in the Peloponnesos, by mapping specific design, constructional, or ornamental elements. By examining the distribution of these elements, I conclude that architectural and artisanal workshops operated broadly throughout the Peloponnesos and likely for a varied clientele of both indigenous Orthodox and Latin settlers. This then suggests that the previously strictly divided categories of "West- ern" and "Byzantine" should be dissolved in favor of a hybrid category of mutually appealing construction and design styles in Medieval Greece. SETTLEMENT AND LAND USE IN VENETIAN MESSENIA: THE USE OF DOCUMENTARY SOURCES IN THE PYLOS REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: SiriolDavies, University of Cincinnati In recent years archaeological surveys in Greece have be- gun to integrate archival evidence with the results of surface survey. In support of its primary goal to investigate the history of prehistoric and historic settlement and land use in western Messenia, PRAP has commissioned research in both Venetian and Ottoman archives, partlywith the aim of comparing docu- mentary evidence on settlement and land use with material remains from the 15th to 19th centuries. Sources dating from the Venetian occupation of the Morea 1687-1715, which I have investigated on behalf of PRAP, include census and ca- dastral material, tax-registers, records of property grants, and letters or reports of Venetian administrators, many of which are unpublished. The importance of these sources is evident on a number of levels: in terms of topography, they can help to identify and locate sites, while in a broader sense they can contribute to our understanding of how changes in political regime can affect settlement patterns and systems of agricul- tural exploitation. Evidence from Venetian documentary sources has directly contributed to the identification of sites found through surface survey in the Pylos area and provided specific answers to questions about changes in the settlement pattern. Its value is enhanced when used in conjunction with data collected from Ottoman archives. The documentary evi- dence thus collected is particularly valuable, given that tech- niques for dating early modern ceramics and buildings are not yet highly developed. SESSION 6F: COLLOQUIUM: ARCHAEOAS- TRONOMY IN THE ANCIENT MEDITERRA- NEAN APPLYING ARCHAEOASTRONOMICAL METHODOL- OGY TO THE MEDITERRANEAN: Anthony Aveni, Colgate University Understanding nature and culture to be closely wedded in the world views of the civilization of antiquity, we examine the system of astronomy implicit in remarks that appear scattered throughout the earliest oral literature. Thus, we recognize and delineate celestial observations that help us to gain a clearer understanding of the methods of observation employed in the practical everyday (oft-called "primitive") astronomy that served as the precursor of the idealized and specialized scientific astronomy that would develop in the later Aegean world. Following a tradition established in New World studies, we offer ceremonial building orientations as possible physical correlates to the largely text-bound approach that dominates the study of Old World astronomy. Examples of such</page><page sequence="72">302 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 106 archaeologically based studies from the latter period include work on the orientations of temples in Magna Graecia and Etruria. These are offered, as in the case of Hoskin's paper, as a means of delineating and establishing a methodology for applying archaeoastronomy. Lastly, and of special concern, is the forging of possible evolutionary links between these forms of calendars and astronomy and earlier practices from the Aegean Bronze Age. THE APPLICATION OF ORIENTATIONS IN PRE- AND PROTOHISTORY: Michael Hoskin, Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge Christian churches traditionally face easterly so that priest and people will face the symbol of Christ in the rising sun. Mosques face Mecca because of the central importance to Islam of what took place there. An archaeologist of the distant future will be able to recover something of these insights if, but only if, he measures and collates the orientations of their ruins. There is no reason to doubt thatwe can similarly benefit if we do the same when studying the pre- and protohistoric monuments of the Mediterranean. I give three examples of the application of this method. First, at the Late Minoan cemetery at Armenoi in Crete, some 300 tombs were excavated out of the bedrock, each with a dromos whose parallel sides accurately define the orientation of the tomb. Second, on the Spanish island of Menorca are Bronze Age sanctuaries that face southerly, from locations chosen to give them an unobstructed view of the southern horizon. It seems likely that they were to face the Southern Cross and other stars of the ancient constellation of Centau- rus. Third, in the Alentejo district of Portugal, I have measured 177 distinctive tombs, each with a chamber bounded by seven lofty stones. Every single one faces within the range of the sunrise. We can explain the pattern most easily if we assume that the tombs were laid out to face sunrise on the day con- struction began, exactly as Christian churches were oriented. THE ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF EARLY BRONZE AGE THOLOs TOMBS ON CRETE: Marie Goodwin, Bryn Mawr College It has been known since the beginning of the 20th cen- tury that the entrances of Early Minoan tholos tombs on Crete usually face east. The eastward facing entrances are consid- ered to be an interesting feature of tholos tomb construction, although few have paid serious attention to this phenom- enon. This paper reports research conducted on the orienta- tions of 35 Early/Middle Minoan tholos tombs (those remain- ing with extant entrances). These measurements provide a data set from which we can analyze the focus of these eastward entrances. The east-facing entrances are oriented toward two distinct regions along the eastern horizon (within a +50 range): one group faces approximately due east, and the other is ori- ented approximately 200 north of due east. There are few variations from this pattern. In addition to reporting the tomb orientations, this paper will integrate the east and northeast focus of these tombs into Early and Middle Minoan society by providing an analysis of chronological and geographical change. The author will also make suggestions about the techniques that were used to construct the tombs with these specific orientations. These techniques may offer basic insights into the conception and use of geometry in the Early Minoan period on Crete. PERCEPTIONS OF THE SUN IN MINOAN RITUAL: Lucy Goodison, Independent Scholar This paper presents results from a long-term project of field- work based on dawn visits at the Mesara-type tombs. This project was to ascertain whether or not there were recurring patterns that might indicate intentionality on the part of the tomb- builders in relation to the positions of the sunrise on the visible horizon. The general description of "east-facing tombs" covers a range of easterly orientations. Each tomb faces the sunrise directly only on certain days. Looking at the variations in alignment suggested that these tholos tomb doorways were aligned to sunrise at specific preferred times of the year, sug- gesting possible dates for seasonal activities at the sites. Addi- tionally, we looked at the alignment of the four doorways of the antechamber of the Knossos Throne Room and the spe- cific effects of the first light at different times of the year on internal architectural features of the Throne Room itself. Set against modern conceptions, the visual evidence seems to raise a number of new questions about how the sun was perceived by the prehistoric users of these buildings and how that may have changed over the course of the Bronze Age and from site to site. THE MINOAN PEAK SANCTUARY ON PYRGOS (MALEVIZIOU): Mary Blomberg and G6ran Henriksson, Uppsala University, Sweden We report the results of our archaeoastronomical study of the small Middle Minoan building on Pyrgos (684 m), near Tylissos. The orientation of the best-preserved long wall of the building indicates that the long axis was aligned to sunrise at the summer solstice. This is the second example of such an orientation for a peak sanctuary in Crete, the other being that of the major axis of the structure on Petsophas. The short axis of the building on Pyrgos is oriented to the heliacal setting of Arcturus, one of the four brightest stars and an important calendar star in the Aegean from very early times. This is the third example from a Minoan peak sanctuary of the orienta- tion to Arcturus, the other two being on Petsophas and Traostalos. At the beginning of the Middle Minoan period the heliacal setting of the star as seen from Pyrgos would have occurred directly above the prominent peak of Kako Kefali, which thus served as a foresight in the same way that Modi did for the heliacal setting of the same star as seen from the peak sanctuary on Traostalos. Conclusions based on the accumulating evidence from ori- entations of the Minoan peak sanctuaries and the palaces will be presented and compared with the differences in focus of grave orientations. MEGALITHS, NEOLITHIC ASTRONOMY, AND EMERG- ING CULTURAL COMPLEXITY IN SOUTHERN EGYPT: J. McKim Malville, University of Colo- rado, Boulder, and Fred Wendorf Southern Meth- odist University The Sahara west of the Nile in southern Egypt was hyperarid and unoccupied during most of the Late Pleistocene. About 11,000years ago the summermonsoons ofcentralAfricamoved into Egypt, and temporary lakes or playas began. The Nabta Playa depression is a kidney-shaped basin, some 10 km by 7 km. Discovery of megalithic alignments and stone circles adjacent</page><page sequence="73">2002] THE 103RD ANNUAL MEETING 303 to Middle and Late Neolithic communities at Nabta indicates the early development of a complex society. The southward shift of monsoons in the Late Neolithic rendered the area again hyperarid and uninhabitable some 5,300 radiocarbon years before the present. This date establishes the complex, which has alignments to cardinal and sostitial directions, as a very early megalithic statement of ideology and astronomy. A "calendar circle" contains sight lines to the north celestial pole and to the position of sunrise on summer solstice near 5000 B.C. Six mega- lithic alignments radiate outward from megalithic structures, which appear to contain cenotaphs. One of the megalithic alignments is oriented toward the rising position of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, at 4800 B.C. The other align- ments appear to be associated with the belt of Orion and with Dubhe, the brightest star in Ursa Major. The symbolism of this ceremonial center suggests early development of a symbolic geometry that integrated death, water, and the sun. An exodus from the Nubian Desert in the period around 5300 b.p. may have precipitated the development of social differentiation and complex culture in predynastic Upper Egypt. SESSION 6G: WORKSHOP: THE ETHNICITY AND ARCHAEOLOGY OF PHOENICIANS IN THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN "Phoenician" is a misleading ethnic label. As the broad term "Greeks" (coined by the Romans) is applied to Mycenaean, Classical, and Hellenistic era "Hellenes" (as they called them- selves), so, too, the term "Phoenicians" (coined by the Greeks) is used to describe Bronze Age Canaanites, Iron Age Phoenicians, Punic Carthaginians, or "Kana'ani" (as they called themselves). Also, like the Greeks (and later the Romans), Phoenicians had a broad range, spanning the entire Mediter- ranean. However useful the term "Greek" may be, it fails to express the chronological, geographical, and ethnic diversity of the Hellenes. Similarly, "Phoenician" encompasses consid- erable diversity. In an attempt to document this diversity, this workshop concentrates on the western Mediterranean and examines archaeological evidence in light of an evolving understanding of ethnicity. It addresses two questions: (1) how were Phoenicians perceived when they came into contact and con- flictwith "Others" (Greeks, Romans, and indigenous peoples)? and (2) how do we interpret the textual and archaeological evidence that attests to those ancient perceptions? The Phoenicians, who like the Greeks and Romans were part of an ancient pan-Mediterranean civilization, lie at the intersection of classical archaeology and ancient Near Eastern studies; but neither discipline incorporates them adequately. As a result, the archaeology of Phoenicians in the West is a neglected topic in Anglo-American scholarship, in sharp con- trast to the lively state of Phoenician studies in Europe and North Africa. This workshop presents recent scholarship and debates in Phoenician studies, much ofit already current abroad, in anticipation of the organization of a formal colloquium on Phoenician archaeology at the next AIA meeting in January 2003.
