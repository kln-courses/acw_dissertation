<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT"' Eric Marson and Keith Leopold Attention has often been drawn to similarities between some of Kafka's writings and the theories of Sigmund Freud. The story "Ein Landarzt" in particular has been seen as an example of the influence of Freud on Kafka's work.l However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has ever been made to trace the development of Kafka's interest in and attitude to Freud, psychoanalysis and psychology in general and to study "Ein Landarzt" as a part of this development. The present study endeavours to do this. In particular it aims at showing that the story "Ein Landarzt" is the literary expression of Kafka's attitude to Freudian psychology. It is reasonably certain that Kafka first became acquainted with the theories of Freud at the series of lectures and discussions held in 1912 at the house of Frau Bertha Fanta.2 The most controversial work published by Freud to this time was Die Traumdeutung.3 Any popular lectures on psychoanalysis or related subjects held in 1912 would certainly have at least mentioned this work. Kafka himself first mentions the name Freud on September 23, 1912 in connection with his story "Das Urteil" (Tagebiicher, p. 294).4 1 The study of "Ein Landarzt" that places most stress on the link with Freud is R. H. Lawson's "Kafka's 'Der [sic] Landarzt,'" Monatshefte, XLIX, 5, 1957. H. Salinger ("More light on Kafka's Landarzt," Monatshefte, LIII, 3, 1961) also sees some connections with Freud. However, both these interpretations differ greatly from the one attempted here. The other interpreters of "Ein Landarzt" (e.g. Maria MiBlbeck, "Franz Kafka's 'Ein Landarzt'," Der Deutsch- unterricht, X, 6, 1958) make little or no mention of Freud. Wilhelm Emrich (Franz Kafka, Bonn, 1958), Heinz Politzer (Franz Kafka: Parable and Paradox, New York, 1962), and Helmut Richter (Franz Kafka: Werk und Entwurf, Berlin, 1962) also do not mention Freud in connection with "Ein Landarzt." 2 See Klaus Wagenbach, Franz Kafka.

This is the only occasion on which Kafka specifically links Freud with any of his works. One immediately assumes that Kafka is thinking of the ob- viously Freudian element in the story: the rivalry between Georg Bendemann and his father. There is, however, a less obvious but perhaps more important connection between Freud and "Das Urteil," and this connection provides convincing evidence that Kafka had read Die Traumdeutung and indeed had read it with considerable care. There are two sections of Die Traumdeutung that are too close in detail and significance to two important episodes in "Das Urteil" for the similarity to be merely coincidental. On p. 1865 Freud re- counts a dream in which he appears as his father's "Krankenpfleger." The father is very old and infirm in the dream, and Freud refers to the emotion of "traurige Genugtuung" that he felt at being able to care for the old man. It is made clear that the satisfaction he feels is due to the reversal of roles in the father-son relationship, but the satisfaction is tinged with sadness since the father is no longer the powerful and worthy rival but only a very infirm old man. The scene in "Das Urteil" in which Georg undresses and puts to bed his apparently docile father is remarkably similar to this section of Die Traumdeutung. The second link between the two works is equally striking. In "Das Urteil" the plot is set in motion by Georg's decision to go into his father's room and tell him of his intention of informing the absent friend about his privately contracted engage- ment. On p. 357 of Die Traumdeutung Freud tells of a very similar episode. He went into the neighbouring room to inform his father of his "eigennmchtige Verlobung." Although the father's reaction was less violent than Herr Bendemann's reaction to Georg's announce- ment, Freud was obliged to wait five years before marrying: a paren- tal decree that was not without similarity to Herr Bendemann's con- demning Georg "zum Tode des Ertrinkens" (Erziihlungen, p. 67), since drowning is frequently used by Kafka as a symbol of bachelor- hood.6 Given the close resemblance between these episodes from 5 Page references are to the readily available pocketbook edition of Die Traumdeutung, Frankfurt a.M., Fischer, 1961. 6 See E.

Marson, "Franz Kafka's Das Urteil", AUMLA, No. 16, 1961. 147</page><page sequence="3">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY "Das Urteil" and Die Traumdeutung and Kafka's own statement "Gedanken an Freud," there can be little doubt that Kafka had read Die Traumdeutung with considerable care. It is also very proba- ble that the phrase "Gedanken an Freud" refers not so much to general Freudian theory as to these personal details from Freud's relationship with his father, which was strikingly similar to Kafka's relationship with his father. At this stage Kafka was probably more interested in Freud the man than in Freud the psychologist.7 After "Das Urteil" Kafka makes no further mention of Freud, psychology or psychoanalysis for almost five years. Naturally this is not proof that he did not read works on psychology in this period, but it does suggest that they were not one of his major interests. In September 1917 there is a brief reference to a psychoanalytical work in which "Die Verwandlung" had been mentioned (Briefe, p. 619), and in the following month there is clear evidence that Kafka was again taking an interest in psychology. This occurs in the third "Oktavheft" dated October 19, 1917 (HVL, p. 72). Here Kafka talks of the impossibility of observing one's own inner world. He says in effect that descriptive psychology, which claims to be able to describe the inner world, really does no more than describe the reflection of the outer world in the inner: hence it is a kind of anthropomorphism. A similar critical note is struck a month later in a letter to 7 That Kafka should have used only two unimportant episodes from Die Traumdeutung is in keeping with his tendency to select from his reading only that which is relevant to himself and his own problems. As an example it could be mentioned that the only de- tailed references anywhere in Kafka to works of English literature concern the father-son conflict. Kafka singles out for special com- ment Swift's remarks (in Gulliver's Travels) on the dangers in- herent in the parental upbringing of children and the suggestion that they would be better off in the hands of tutors. (Briefe, pp. 342-7). In a conversation with Gustav Janouch, Kafka mentions the theme of Synge's drama The Playboy of the Western World, in which the father-son relationship bears a very close resemblance to that portrayed in "Das Urteil." The son boasts of having over- come and killed his father, but the latter appears in the last act very much alive and "macht den jungen Bezwinger der viterlichen Autoritit unm6glich." (Gustav Janouch, Gespriche mit Kafka, Frankfurt a.M., 1961, p. 38). 148</page><page sequence="4">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" Brod concerning a book by Bliiher (Die Rolle der Erotik in der miinnlichen Gesellschaft.

Jena, 1917): "Im iibrigen hat es (das Buch) mit allem Psychoanalytischem gemein, daB3 es im ersten Augenblick erstaunlich sittigt, man aber kurz nach- her den gleichen alten Hunger wieder hat." (Briefe, p. 197) Other critical or derogatory utterances on the subject of psychology and psychoanalysis are made during the following months (HVL, p. 107, p. 122 and p. 153). The last of these begins with a sentence that suggests strongly that Kafka had been reading a lot of psychology and also sums up his attitude to the subject: "Ubelkeit nach zuviel Psychologie." After 1918 Kafka's interest in psychology and psychoanalysis seems to have waned. However, he returned to the subject twice be- fore his death: first, indirectly, in the famous "Brief an den Vater" (November 1919), which contains a conscious application of psycho- logical principles to his own case, and later (probably late 1921) in a letter to Milena Jesenska. In this letter Kafka makes his strongest and most carefully reasoned attack on psychoanalysis. He denies the therapeutic value of psychoanalysis and sees the "illness" that it claims to have discovered and attempts to cure as being basically matters of religious faith. As this passage is an admirable summing up of Kafka's views on psychoanalysis8 and as it is vital to a full understanding of "Ein Landarzt," it is here quoted in full. Kafka is endeavouring to explain the "Angst" that loomed so large in his relationship with Milena: Du sagst, Milena, dab Du es nicht verstehst. Such es zu ver- stehen, indem Du es Krankheit nennst. Es ist eine der vielen Krankheitserscheinungen, welche die Psychoanalyse aufgedeckt zu haben glaubt. Ich nenne es nicht Krankheit und sehe in dem therapeutischen Teil der Psychoanalyse einen hilflosen Irrtum. Alle diese angeblichen Krankheiten, so traurig sie auch aussehen, sind Glaubenstatsachen, Verankerungen des in Not befindlichen Menschen in irgend welchem miitterlichen Boden; so findet ja auch die Psychoanalyse als Urgrund der Religionen auch nichts anderes, als was ihrer Meinung nach die "Krank- heiten" des einzelnen begriindet, allerdings fehlt heute hier bei uns meist die religiose Gemeinschaft, die Sekten sind zahllos und auf Einzelpersonen beschrinkt, aber vielleicht zeigt es sich 8 Kafka himself must have been impressed by this passage for he copied it almost word for word into his notebooks (HVL, p. 335). 149</page><page sequence="5">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY so nur dem von der Gegenwart befangenen Blick. Solche Veran- kerungen aber, die wirklich Boden fassen, sind doch nicht ein einzelner auswechselbarer Besitz des Menschen, sondern in seinem Wesen vorgebildet und nachtriglich sein Wesen (auch seinen K6rper) noch in dieser Richtung weiterbildend. Hier will man heilen? (Briefe an Milena, p. 246-7). It was during the winter of 1916-1917, at about the time of his most intense preoccupation with psychoanalysis, that Kafka wrote the story "Ein Landarzt."9 It would be reasonable to expect that an obviously Freudian story, written at a time when Kafka was interested in psychoanalysis, would in some way reflect the author's views on this subject. We endeavour to show in the following analysis that "Ein Landarzt" does reproduce exactly Kafka's known or easily pre- dictable views on the original development of psychoanalysis, its ef- fects on the man most directly involved in this development (Freud), the type of illness it is supposed to cure, and the nature and degree of success of its treatment of these illnesses. The story is a very compact unity lacking even division into paragraphs, but its meaning as we see it allows the events described to be divided, for the purpose of analysis, into four organically de- veloping sections. The first of these describes the country doctor's predicament and how he solves it. It concludes with his arrival at the patient's bedside. A country doctor has been summoned to attend a sick boy in a village some ten miles away, but he cannot make the journey over the snow-covered roads because his own horse is dead and he cannot borrow another. In desperation he kicks open the door of his disused pig-pen. A groom and two splendid horses emerge. The groom attacks the doctor's maid Rosa. Then he harnesses the horses to the doctor's carriage. Almost instantly the doctor finds himself at his destination, but at the moment of leaving his home he had heard the groom breaking down the door in order to reach the maid, who had taken refuge in the house. Kafka makes his doctor a country doctor primarily in order to make credible the rather unusual situation in which the doctor finds himself: that of being unable to reach his patient. It is the type of problem that could occasionally confront a country doctor in winter. Later in the story it is made clear that the doctor is also unable to 9 See Franz Kafka, Die Erzihlungen, Frankfurt a.M., 1961, pp. 126- 131. 150</page><page sequence="6">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" reach his patient in another sense: even when he miraculously over- comes the spatial distance between himself and his patient, he can still achieve nothing by ordinary medical means, for the patient is not sick in any physical sense. From a purely medical point of view the summons had been erroneous and unjustified: a "Fehlliiuten der Nachtglocke." This constitutes a very close parallel to the origin of psycho- analytical procedures. Both these and Freud's theories of the inter- pretation of dreams derive from the fact that Freud in his medical practice came upon patients who had all the symptoms of a physical ailment even though there was no diagnosable organic cause. They were patients who could not be reached by ordinary medical means. If they were to be reached at all, a totally new approach was needed. It seemed to Freud that only a psychological approach was possible. In the absence of any significant body of knowledge in this field, Freud was virtually compelled to create psychoanalysis, using his own self to do so and in the process delving deep into his own sub- conscious. When the country doctor kicks open the door of his own disused pig-pen, he too is taking the decision to use his own self and to delve deep into his own subconscious in order to reach his patient. (The disused pig-pen is a very telling symbol for the doctor's subconscious). His action has two immediate consequences, one apparently good, the other apparently bad. It unleashes the splendid horses that bear the doctor magically to his destination, but it also unleashes the frightening figure of the groom, who, it is clear, will violate the maid Rosa. The symbolism is by no means obscure. The horses are the new psychological forces that Freud discovered and that made it possible to reach patients inaccessible to traditional medicine. The groom is the lustful, uncontrollable, instinctual forces that lie deep in the subconscious and were also brought to light by Freud's delving. Rosa is the doctor's psyche. (She has lived almost unnoticed in the doctor's establishment until the moment in which he liberates the new psychological forces. Then she becomes of importance to him and he regrets his previous neglect.) It is clearly suggested that the new psychological powers are released at a cost: the loss of the doctor's psyche. The first section of the story is in no way critical of psycho- analysis. It is a symbolic representation of Kafka's view of the origins 151</page><page sequence="7">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY of psychoanalysis and probably reflects his early interest in Freud the man and the problems that confronted him in his search for a new science. The second part of the text begins at the patient's bedside and ends with the decision to discover the wound. Having arrived at the patient's house, the doctor gains the impression that there is nothing organically wrong with the boy, even though the latter begs the doctor to let him die. The instruments in the doctor's case are obviously of no avail. Suddenly he thinks of Rosa and longs to save her. He resolves to leave but is induced by the female part of the company to examine the patient. His impression that there is nothing really wrong with the boy is confirmed. His thoughts again turn to Rosa. Then, seeing the family disappointed at his lack of activity, he is prepared to concede that the boy is sick. He goes to him again and discovers the wound. The central features of this part of the story are the doctor's regret and rage at the loss of Rosa and his reluctant decision to discover a wound in the otherwise healthy boy. The doctor's attitude to the loss of Rosa reflects the early atti- tude of many to Freud's apparent despoiling of the traditional con- cept of the soul or psyche. The soul was shown as anything but the ethereal and divine element in the human make-up. It was dissected and analysed, and the previously unknown and often repulsive under- currents within its activity were spied out and mercilessly mapped. And it could be maintained that the first person to lose his psyche in this fashion was Freud himself, though his reaction to this was very different from the country doctor's. The decision to discover the wound is made only after the doc- tor has twice examined the boy. The first examination is little more than a cursory glance as he enters the room; in the second he goes as far as laying his head on the boy's chest. This second examination is accompanied by the neighing of one of the horses, both of which have put their heads through the window. It is clearly a reminder and a challenge to the doctor to use the new psychological forces available to him. But the doctor is still not ready to do this. Only after he has again thought of Rosa, considered his duty as a physician and seen the extreme unhappiness of the family (especially the wo- men) does he make the decision to "discover the wound": i.e. to use the new psychological forces. And this time, as he approaches 152</page><page sequence="8">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" the patient, both the horses are neighing. This second section of the story, like the first, is in no way an expression of hostility towards psychoanalysis. It represents Kafka's view of the early reactions of the medical profession (and perhaps even the first secret reactions of Freud himself) to the new science: namely sorrow at the despoiling of the traditional concept of the soul and a certain reluctance to apply the new forces that had been unleashed. The most important part of the story now follows. The wound is discovered in the boy's side. It is large, filled with worms, and pink in color. The family is delighted to see the doctor's activity. The boy, who had previously whispered "Doktor, laB mich sterben" now asks "Wirst du mich retten?" The doctor's reaction to the question is expressed in the words: "So sind die Leute in meiner Gegend. Immer das Unm6gliche vom Arzt verlangen. Den alten Glauben haben sie verloren; der Pfarrer sitzt zu Hause und zerzupft die MeBgewander, eines nach dem andern; aber der Arzt soll alles leisten mit seiner zarten chirurgischen Hand." However, the doctor is now willing to be used "zu heiligen Zwecken." He lets himself be un- dressed by the family and the village elders while a choir of school- children sings a song, the burden of which is: "Entkleidet ihn, dann wird er heilen,/ Und heilt er nicht, so t6tet ihn!" The doctor is placed in the patient's bed, and he and the patient are left alone. The boy expresses lack of faith in the doctor and annoyance at his intrusion. The doctor suggests that such wounds are not uncommon and says a few meaningless words to console the patient, who then dies. The first main element in this key section is the wound itself. The wound is the psyche or soul of the boy. To place this beyond doubt Kafka begins the description of the wound with the adjective 'pink' ("rosa"): "Rosa, in vielen Schattierungen, dunkel in der Tiefe . . ." In this way the word comes to be capitalized and separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma. It therefore suggests immediately the girl Rosa, the symbol already used for the doctor's own psyche.'0 In making the boy's psyche a wound, Kafka 1o Rosa is the only character in the story who bears a name. It would seem very probable that Kafka gave her a name in order to make this association. 153</page><page sequence="9">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY is reproducing the situation that confronted Freud in his patients suffering from hysteria: he could examine them again and again using traditional procedures and find no organic cause of their sick- ness, but the moment he approached them with the techniques of his psychology, the hysteric lesion became visible-a diseased psyche in the place of the organic lesion that would normally produce the symptoms of the sick person. The worms in the wound represent the repressed and yet still very vital experiences that inhabit the uncon- scious and cause illness by emerging into consciousness, i.e. the upper part of the wound. The second main element in this section is the doctor's reaction to the wound. He is sure the boy will die and at first has no intention of trying to cure him, simply because the wound and its parasites do not constitute a medical problem at all. It is made quite explicit that the problem is not medical but religious. The boy, like the other inhabitants of the district, has lost his religious faith, and the man who could and should cure him sits at home engaged in endless theological hair-splitting. But the doctor, against his better judgment, allows himself to be used "zu heiligen Zwecken," again implying that the healing of the wound is not his task but the priest's.1l The third important element is the undressing of the doctor and his being placed in the patient's bed. The meaning is that the doctor who wishes to treat this type of illness must be prepared to allow those who witness the approach to the patient to undress him, the undressing signifying self-revealment, the laying bare of the inner nature.l2 The reference is to the self-revealment that Freud was forced to practice in his early writings. In the absence of a previous tradition Freud had to use his own personality as a source of mate- rial for his theories. This is most obvious in Die Traumdeutung, the work by Freud that Kafka had certainly read. Freud himself makes numerous references to the painful use of personal details in the 1 The religious aspects are further emphasized by faint echoes of the episode at the end of Flaubert's La Ldgende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier in which the saint lies naked in his bed with a leper covered with sores. The leper turns into Christ. 12 Kafka often uses the removal of clothes as a symbol of the stripping away of the outer layers of the personality: i.e. self-revealment. The most striking example is the fragment beginning HVL, p. 104, line 21, 154</page><page sequence="10">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" book.'l On Kafka, with his penchant for secrecy and concealment in his literary production and his semi-public documents, this merciless self-revealment must have made a very strong impression. The placing of the doctor in the patient's bed is the subject of the children's second song: "Freuet euch, ihr Patienten,/ Der Arzt ist euch ins Bett gelegt!" It is given as the reason why those psycho- logically ill should rejoice. Clearly Kafka is using the doctor's being placed in bed with the patient as the symbol for the whole process of psychoanalytic treatment. The symbol has this form because the bed represents the patient's dreams (which are a central factor in the analytic cure) and because the psychoanalyst, to effect his cure, must approach the patient on a much more intimate level than is necessary in normal medical practice. It is also possible that the episode was intended to suggest that the lay bystanders see in the doctor someone just as sick as the patient, and the doctor's acquies- cence in being placed in the bed may suggest that he agrees with this view. The final episode in this section is the "treatment" of the wound and its outcome. Kafka here depicts a patient's typical reaction to psychoanalytical treatment: initial lack of faith in the new pro- cedure, some hostility towards the practitioner, and finally acceptance of the method and the man, and the achievement of some comfort and consolation in the end. The doctor's part in the treatment con- sists mainly in his attempt to provide some consolation before the patient dies: first the statement that such wounds are not really so rare (i.e. many patients have hysteric lesions of this sort) and then the nonsense describing the origin of the wound. This meaningless explanation is doubtless a parody of some of the psychoanalytical explanations that Kafka came to distrust so much. However, the really important aspect of this section is the fact that the boy dies. The new psychoanalytical treatment had perhaps given the patient some slight comfort before death but had done nothing to cure the disease. There can be no doubt that this section is the heart of the story. As in the first two sections, Kafka presents more or less ob- jectively what might be termed aspects of psychoanalysis: he shows that there is such a thing as psychological illness and that the psycho- analyst can reveal it. He also shows that Freud, and possibly other is Particularly pp. 7, 96, 371, 396. 155</page><page sequence="11">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY early psychoanalysts, were compelled to undergo a painful process of self-exposure in public view in order to establish the principles of the new science. However, where this section differs from the earlier sections is that Kafka does not limit himself to a symbolic but ob- jective representation of aspects of Freud and psychoanalysis: he now makes it clear that in his view the therapeutic claims of psycho- analysis are quite false. This is shown not only in the incidents of the story but also in the doctor's statement quoted above ("So sind die Leute etc.") which is essentially the same as Kafka's later sum- ming-up of psychoanalysis in the letter to Milena. The fourth and last section of the text describes the doctor's escape from the house of his patient and the fate that befalls him when he tries to return to his house with the "unirdischen Pferden." No doubt motivated by the threat in the children's song ("Und heilt er nicht, so t6tet ihn!"), the doctor thinks of escape immediately when his patient dies. He throws his clothes into the carriage and jumps onto one of the horses, thinking the return home will be as rapid as the journey to the patient. But the horses cannot be con- trolled. As he goes off through the snow he hears the children sing- ing a new song-a song of hope for the sick. He knows that he cannot return to his previous life and bitterly regrets having obeyed the erroneous summons of the night bell. It is clear that the doctor has no possibility of returning to the old way of life represented by the lost practice and the violated Rosa. Even though he is now riding one of the horses instead of being drawn along by them, he still cannot control them. Naked and unable to reach his fur coat, he is a ridiculous figure, and yet, as an aged man exposed to the bitter cold, he is also an object of sym- pathy, even pity. And the worst of it is that it has all been in vain. All this has been for the sake of a patient who could not be cured by either the doctor's old or new treatment. The symbolism of this rich and vivid final section is not as trans- parent and unambiguous as that of the other sections.l4 The general 14 It is noteworthy that for the only time in the story Kafka uses in the closing lines a concept that does not seem to spring naturally from the situations in which the doctor finds himself: "dem Froste dieses ungliickseligsten Zeitalters ausgesetzt." By the reference to "this most unhappy of ages" Kafka seems to be consciously ex- panding the range of symbols used and introducing a generalized, even universalized element that is lacking elsewhere in the story. 156</page><page sequence="12">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" meaning is clear enough: psychoanalysis has not succeeded in curing mankind's ills. A possible interpretation is that in psychoanalysis forces have been unleashed that cannot be fully controlled. Not only have these forces failed to cure mankind's ills but they have cut off their discoverer (Freud) from any possibility of a return to the mental and spiritual state that preceded the discovery. He has exposed his inmost self to such an extent that the exposure can never be hidden. Thus exposed, he is a figure of ridicule and yet at the same time deserving of sympathy. Particularly important in the final section of the story is the song the children sing: "Freuet euch, ihr Patienten,/ Der Arzt ist euch ins Bett gelegt!" To make it quite clear that the story is about Freud and psychoanalysis Kafka begins the song with a barely con- cealed pun on the name Freud.l5 The song also has overtones of both religious and secular exhortations to rejoice: e.g. Luther's "Nun freut euch, Christen, insgemein" and the secular "Freut euch des Lebens."'1 In the circumstances the song is bitterly ironic, and the doctor describes it as "der neue, aber irrtiimliche Gesang der Kinder." It is new because it is different from the song they sang before and it is "irrtiimlich" because the hope it expresses for the sick has just been shown to be completely false. Not only does the content of "Ein Landarzt" reproduce Kafka's attitude to Freud and his theories but the form and technique of the story are almost completely conditioned by Freud's psychology, particularly by the theories of dream interpretation. The story is in the form of a dream consciously synthesized according to the "laws" which Freud established in Die Traumdeutung as influencing the transformation of the latent content of a dream into the manifest content.17 This form is particularly suited to the subject matter of 15 Freud himself complains of weak puns ("schwachsinnige Witze- leien") on his name. Die Traumdeutung, p. 179. 16 Kafka elsewhere makes specific reference to a parody on this song. The accused in the fragmentary "Unterstaatsanwalt" had made his insulting reference to the royal picture ("Du Lump dort oben") to the tune of "Freut euch des Lebens" (HVL, p. 369). 17 Some of the writers on "Ein Landarzt" have seen in a general way the close resemblance to a dream as experienced or recalled. (Heinz Politzer, Franz Kafka: Parable and Paradox, New York, 1962, p. 89; Helmut Richter, Franz Kafka: Werk und Entwurf, Berlin, 1962, p. 133.) 157</page><page sequence="13">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY the story: Kafka's attitude to Freud and his discoveries is couched in the form of a dream-a highly significant, highly interpretable dream whose manifest content never quite succeeds in hiding the real or latent implications of the apparently absurd events. In the following brief discussion some of Freud's main laws of dream interpretation are stated and it is shown how Kafka applies these in the form and technique of the story. To begin with, Freud showed conclusively that time and space are lacking in the manifest content of the dream unless they are present in the latent content. This is the most obvious dream-device that Kafka employs, and much of the irrational and dreamlike atmosphere of the story arises from the absence of temporal and spatial orientation. In the latent content of "Ein Landarzt" the distance between the doctor and his patient is not a physical distance at all.18 Consequently in the manifest content this distance does not really exist and does not require any time to traverse, even though "zehn Meilen" are supposed to separate the doctor from his patient. Likewise Rosa returns from the village as soon as the doctor thinks of her mission. There is no sense of her being absent or of his having to wait for her since the latent content does not concern a girl's efforts to borrow a horse in a village. In Freud's theory the latent dream content is distorted by numer- ous mechanisms. Above all it is so thoroughly condensed that the dream is almost unbelievably shorter than its real meaning. The dream is concise and laconic. This is so obviously true of "Ein Landarzt" that no detailed comment is needed. The story moves at a breath- taking speed and packs into a few pages material requiring a very lengthy explanation. Moreover, the latent content of a dream may express itself at the manifest level in the form of symbols. Unpleasant ideas may be expressed symbolically so that they lose their unpleasantness, and the symbol itself is a major condensing device. It is hardly necessary to dwell again on the numerous symbols of the story: Rosa, the pig-pen, the groom, the horses, the wound and its contents. Particularly strik- ing in this connection is the undressing of the doctor, which conveys 18 Compare "Eine alltigliche Verwirrung" (HVL, p. 74) where the distance between the two villages plays a crucial role as physical distance, even though the time taken to travel it is highly variable. 168</page><page sequence="14">KAFKA, FREUD, AND "EIN LANDARZT" an unpleasant experience in a way that is at least superficially un- recognizable and at the same time does this with the greatest brevity. Emotions felt in a dream belong to the latent content and not to the symbols and situations chosen by the dreams to represent the latent content on the manifest level. This feature of the "Traumar- beit" is employed by Kafka to great effect in the description of the dreadful wound and its sickening contents. These do not arouse dis- gust in the doctor because in the latent content they are the patient's psyche and its ills and as such are incapable of causing physical disgust. Further, causality cannot be expressed in the manifest content of the dream except as a succession of events. Thus the doctor realizes at the latent level that because he has decided to treat the patient with the new method he must be prepared to let the by- standers see his inmost self. At the manifest level this realization becomes a succession of events: the decision to treat the patient, followed by the undressing of the doctor. The dream often translates emotions into their opposites if there is a chance of the dreamer becoming so disturbed as to awaken. The country doctor is a conscientious "Bezirksarzt" clearly concerned with his professional ethic when he has to attempt a cure against its dictates. But there is no trace of the expected reaction from him when the treatment fails badly and the patient dies. At the latent level it is clear what this reaction would be, but in the text it is expressed only by its exact opposite: the song calling on all patients to rejoice now that the doctor has decided to use his new cure. This is the only direct comment the story contains on the death of the patient. In the same way the doctor is undressed but feels "durchaus gefaBt und allen iiberlegen," which is exactly the opposite of what one would expect in a person wholly naked in the presence of total strangers of both sexes. And of course such absolute lack of dis- comfort is the opposite of Freud's own feelings about the more in- direct kind of self-revealment. "Ein Landarzt" contains two further links with Freud and dreams. In the first place there are the two very significant examples of word-association and punning-mechanisms to which Freud as- cribed unexpected importance as connecting elements between dis- 159</page><page sequence="15">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY parate ideas.19 In the second place the surprising changes of tense from past to present and present to past could well correspond to the varying levels of immediacy and vividness that may occur within the same dream.20 Even this brief account of the links between Freud's theories of dream interpretation and the form and technique of "Ein Land- arzt" strongly suggests that the story was written by Kafka under the influence of the Freudian principles. Indeed it might not be going too far to see in the form and manifest content of "Ein Land- arzt" a parody of Freud's theories on the dream. "Ein Landarzt" is probably the most consciously constructed of all Kafka's stories. It is as though, in the midst of his preoccupation with psychoanalysis, Kafka had decided to give literary form to his views on the subject and, as a supreme joke, to express these views in terms of this science that he had come to distrust and dislike. Not only are the form and technique a conscious application of Freudian principles but the content is a subtly disguised depiction of Kafka's view of the origins of psychoanalysis, of Freud the man, of various aspects of psychoanalytical processes and, above all, of the futility and ineffectiveness of psychoanalytical therapy. It is a tribute to Kafka's literary gifts and psychological insight that despite all this the story never gives an impression of artificiality but remains a narrative of remarkable power, vividness and multivalence.
