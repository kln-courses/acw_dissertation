<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay follows the science fiction of C.J. Cherryh after Freud after Derrida in order to draw attention to the non-human limits of writing. The delay to which any and all writing is subject, even a total delay, is brought into particular focus through the psychoanalytic investment in transference. Animal Transference: A "Mole-like Progression" in C.J. Cherryh LYNN TURNER This C.J. "becoming essay Cherryh, brings literary Forty several of Thousand the science literal" fictions in Gehenna. ("Freud" together. That 230) It through is follows to say, what a it particular seconds Derrida Derrida's novel calls the by "becoming literary of the literal" ("Freud" 230) through a particular novel by C.J. Cherryh, Forty Thousand in Gehenna. That is to say, it seconds Derrida's insistence that psychoanalysis should pay greater attention to writing. "Science fic- tion" stands here both for the genre inhabited by Cherryh and also as a name for Freud's own writing, perhaps all writing, after Derrida. The essay gives emphasis to the delay that Derrida finds in Freud, but without the reassurance that that inciden- tal delay will sometime soon be met, if not exactly on time. Rather, that delayed let- ter, message, sign, affect can always be lost in the post. This postal principle is at work in every transition, transmission, transference. This essay takes particular account of the latter. The print metaphor that vehicles Freud's understanding of transference as a "new edition of an old desire" ("Observations") reminds us of the series of mechan- ical models drawn in, only to be expelled at the last, to his attempts to clarify the workings of the psyche through an analogy made famous in his "Note Upon the Mosaic 44/3 0027-1276-07/163014$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">164 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) 'Mystic Writing Pad."' Derrida, of course, finds the technical supplement unable to be so readily expelled, drawing the text and the psyche into inextricable relation through their commonality as writing machines: his insistence upon a certain originary tech- nicity is well known. In recent years (including within two special issues of Mosaic on "The Animal"), it is Derridas attention to our relation to "the animal" and to animals that has not only generated debate but forcefully signalled that writing is no simple out- put registered to only one, properly human, address (The Animal That Therefore I Am). One further reference point has enabled the enquiry of this essay, and that is an essay by Nicholas Royle, first delivered at that Cerisy-la-Salle colloquium on L'animal autobiographique. Royle's "Mole" ironically reminded Derrida of his own delayed engagement with the animal in Specters of Marx, even as the animal would, as he pre- dicted, "become massively unavoidable" (Derrida, qtd. in Royle 245). He also excavated an intriguing animal figure used by Derrida himself but not given much attention in the latter 's animal autobiography of hedgehogs, rams, silkworms, monkeys, ants, wolves, asses, and more. (In The Animal That Therefore I Am Derrida devotes several pages to reminding the reader that he has not suddenly made an animal turn [35-38]). The "mole-like progression" ("Freud" 214) that Royle unearths provides a figure whose traces suffer from the continual risk of undermining themselves. This figure is perhaps less amenable to those who read The Animal That Therefore I Am rather quickly, seizing upon Derridas insistence that the cat to which he refers really existed and paying less attention to Derridas necessary reminder that, performative reassurances notwithstanding, the nature of text is such that readers can find no cor- nerstone of proof within it, that we will not finally be able to safeguard this cat to (an ideology of) realism. Royle's deconstructive mole troubles the edges of figurai and realist ambition; it is tricky to re-deploy. The "subterranean toil" of this mole gives a sense of an unconscious without a secret store of presence that is only displaced or delayed from our conscious grasp and figurally links with the non-human species that writes on the surface of the planet Gehenna in Cherryh. Animality, technicity, and writing come together in the pre-posthuman writing of C.J. Cherryh. If this essay hesitates on the before and the after of "pre" and "post," that is for several reasons: one is that there is no present-human, no isolated endpoint fully formed as such, and there never will be such a being. Another reason is the prescience of Cherryh's work in speaking to debates currently functioning under the name of posthu- manism (Wolfe). Finally, perhaps the notion of a posthuman makes sense only when "post" is read destinerrantly, after Derrida, losing its simple, sequential temporality. Cherryh is well placed to self-consciously explore what we imagine as human through the allegories of science fiction. While she is an extremely prolific writer, hav-</page><page sequence="3">Lynn Turner 165 ing devised several sequences of novels within discrete universes, this essay turns to the one named by its division into two political heavyweights, the "Union-Alliance" universe. Across the books set in the Union-Alliance universe, a machinic figure dom- inates: the virtual technology that Cherryh names "tape."1 The early books index the terror of the virtual learning curve as the early practice of "taking tape" gradually sup- plant the supposedly "real" experience in the training of space pilots ( Heavy Time). In the later books, tape has entered universal usage, whether to educate, to punish, or to reassure, only to have its inevitable fallibilities realized in the shocking revelation that education by tape, including the total re-education of "CODE AX," could fail to rewrite the psychic life of the subjects to whom it was administered ( Regenesis ). Seductive as the most extensive and relatively well-known book in the series, Cyteen , might be, because it charts the psychic and political dramas of a culture in which humans are as instrumentalized by the appropriation of genetic code as they are by the use of tape, this essay will concentrate on the dispersal of the functioning of tape between human and non-human species in the lesser known Forty Thousand in Gehenna. Suffice to say few technical details are fleshed out in Cherryh's accounts of tape - enough for the narrative to be persuasive, not so much that this future already sounds anachronistic. But the use of tape to instruct plays to the image of two reels, one leading inevitably to the other, to tape as a figure of transference (see Turner and Hegarty). Animals and machines are joined together, but in counterpoint to Descartes: in ways that humans cannot move beyond. Moreover, unlike Cyteen , Forty Thousand in Gehenna invests less narrative effort in melding political thriller into science fiction and rather takes a more anthropological - or zoological - tone in its account of the time of a political experiment. The extended time and the tone of Cherryh's Forty Thousand in Gehenna make readers wait and revise their understanding of the activ- ities upon Gehenna just as the colonizers must do, prompting consideration of what writing might be, such that non-human species may be said to write. Cherryh thus contrasts someone like Naomi Mitchison, whose 1962 novel Memoirs of a Spacewoman embeds the reader in an autobiography in which interspecies communi- cation is assumed. While the workings of transference in the analytic session are well known, this essay begins with the familiar scene of that session only to revise its cast list and its functioning. Shifting grounds in the house of free association, Jo-fi, one of Freud's chows, was inside Freud's sessions. On the mark of the Freudian hour, like clockwork, she showed the analysands the door. Sharing her hours in analysis with Jo-fi, H.D. was annoyed.2 But in defence of Jo-fi, Freud reportedly said that she "always behaves psy- choanalytically" (qtd. in Dufresne 141). Noting Freud's lenience regarding the shared</page><page sequence="4">166 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) 1. Sigmund Freud shown with Jo-fi in his office in Vienna, Austria, in 1937. © AP/Press Association Images. space occupied by his dogs and his clients, Gary Genosko comments that even the Wolfman, a man with a certain phobia, could not avoid Anna Freud's Alsatian, named Wolf, when attending his sessions (Genosko 2). Wolf, without ambivalence, only bites people he doesn't like, Freud told Ernest Jones. He did bite Jones, and though the dog was technically reprimanded, Freud's sympathies remained with Wolf (Genosko 3). Like Jo-fi, Wolf worked as a pet compass, pointing always to the truth. There is a piquant schadenfreude to the telling of these stories. We smirk. They tend not to cir- culate in support of a return to Freud (see Todd Dufresne's Killing Freuâ, for exam- ple). Rather, they convey a texture to the image of the session quite other than that of a neutral screen calculated to induce reminiscences. These are some of the many animals that lead Marjorie Garber to read the "ani- mal turn" in cultural studies as an effect of transference. Writing in 1996, and thus prior to Derrida's major writings on animals, Garber published an article on pet love that ends with this damning conclusion, curtailing attention to animals as the symp- tomatic displacement of a now rightly discredited humanism. Who transfers? We do: "Anthropomorphism is itself a kind of transference," she says ("Heavy" 32). Without questioning the contours of the anthropos , and thus without introducing the question</page><page sequence="5">Lynn Turner 167 of the postality of who transfers onto whom, Garber nevertheless maintains transfer- ence as a kind of ruse. Sounding like she has summarily dismissed pet love as inau- thentic, as the simple projection of the soppy-minded, Garber nevertheless reminds us that "all loves function [...] in a chain of substitutions" - in other words, we all transfer (28). This, presumably, is the caveat driving her to also publish, in the same year, a book - Dog Love - that is entirely composed of anecdote. Accounts of Freud's relationships with his dogs resonate both with the familiar endorsements of pet lovers and with the expulsion of the animal in Lacan's views of subjectivity in two apparently conflictual senses. Behaving automatically like clock- work, never hiding their true feelings regarding visitors to Freud's apartment, Freud's dogs exhibit the "incapacity to pretend to pretend ( feindre de feindre) or to erase [their] traces, an incapacity that makes [them] unable to be a 'subject,' that is to say, 'subject of the signifier'" (Lacan qtd. in Derrida, Animal 122). Jacques Lacan's assertion indexes the element in his work that comes under fire in Derrida's reconsideration of the animal. Derrida's insistence of trace over signifier and his troubling of the assumption that humans do have the ability to pretend to pretend motivates the argu- ment of this essay. Yet if Freud did defend Jo-fi, indeed her presence in the session, through assert- ing her appropriately "psychoanalytic behaviour," this might also suggest the reverse. The dogs did not lie - not because they could not, but because there was no need to do so: listening very well indeed like a perfect analyst, they were always simply cor- rect.3 Verily, they were subjects-supposed-to-know. These two views belong to the same Cartesian logic that runs animals and machines together. Maintaining his inti- mate yet critical relation to psychoanalysis, Derrida traces this logic as it dogs the the- ory that Lacan might otherwise have produced without reinstalling the divide of human from other animals as that of response from reaction. As strues we know, the former the Cartesian as an ability division possessed between by response humanity and alone reaction and the typically latter as con- the strues the former as an ability possessed by humanity alone and the latter as the default position of the animal; it can only react. Derrida notes a few exceptions to this philosophical formulation: these exceptions start with weakness or non-ability that yet works to dialectically secure the singular ability of the human. One such dialectical exer- cise stars in Lacan's narrative of the subject before the mirror ("The Mirror Stage"). Immature, weak in the world, the human infant is yet leashed to what Derrida names an " autotelic specularity," to an image that stages a string of substitutions returning, loy- ally, to the mirror's predicted motor superiority ( Animal 122). This superiority grasps the symbolic register when words are exchanged for things, thereby allowing humans to</page><page sequence="6">168 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) move the world from a distance, by tongue alone. Language, narrowly construed as speech, steps in to supplement humanity's initial weakness with an eventual strength, an ability and a property. Yes there is a gap, a deferral, but only temporarily: this narrative plants a promise that infirmity will be overcome. Without need of this dialectical seizure, animals lack lack, for Lacan, and so lack response-ability. While animals, Lacan con- cedes, enter a specular recognition of others of their species, their mirror does not spur a misrecognition in anticipation of linguistic subordination of the world. They stay put. Derrida intervenes at numerous levels in Lacan's history of humanity, notably in the assumed human ability to decide between response and reaction and in the fetters that Lacan attaches to animal movements, restraining their marks from operating as signs or signatures. Allowing that animals may pretend in the exceptional contexts of seduction or combat, as quoted previously, Lacan bars them from a notional second order reflex: they cannot pretend to pretend. This doubling, ostensibly outpacing need in favour of desire, lays the ground of language when hedged within the field of the signifier. Telling the difference between pretending and pretending to pretend, how- ever, and as Derrida indicates, is a tall order. Establishing both the human capacity to respond and to pretend to pretend, that is, lie, comes into its own in the analytic session. There, the ethics of the encounter demand that the analyst be able to respond to the Speech of the analysand. Capitalizing the "s" of Speech signifies the specific level at stake. The analyst must listen with two ears in order to differentiate between the analysand's conscious but effectively pretended speech acts and the Full Speech of the Unconscious, where the latter always speaks the Truth. Hearing the difference, hearing who is really being addressed, the analyst must then be able to respond with a performative intervention addressed to the latter (and to the letter), that is to say with Speech that will have a particular effect. Responding at this level, the analyst countersigns the analysand as a subject (of the signifier). This address returns us to the subject of transference and also thereby to a scene of seduction or combat, or seduction and combat, given the generation of ambiva- lence in transference. In the transference, the analyst must bring to attention the love that the analysand declares as a repetition, as what Freud called a "new edition of an old desire" rather than as the expression of spontaneous feelings. Learning of counter- transference too late, Freud warns the analyst not to be seduced. Once recognized by the analysand as repetition - and a repetition with perfect registration to indicate the idealized print metaphor - the transference loses force, and the improper old desire can be worked through as a memory. John Forrester has usefully elaborated the precisely performative quality of the psychoanalytic session, although that performativity remains within an Austinian</page><page sequence="7">Lynn Turner 169 frame exacting how to do things with words. Where J.L. Austin sidelined the pre- tended, theatrical speech act because it was not intended, Derrida inverted the case, locating a level of performance as the machinic displacement of intentionality as the general condition of all text acts ("Signature"). This already shakes the ground of the decision between the two steps of pretence, and it reshapes the "Founding Speech" acts of analysis by the same token. In spite of the catchiness of the "performative speech act," the breadth of Derridas work leads beyond speech and beyond the signi- fier, and this without turning all the world into the likeness of a language. It is not that speech does not matter, of course. Derridas revision of speech as a sub- set of writing is well known, as is his early critique of the ideality of the signifier in Lacan (in "The Purveyor of Truth"). In the more recent essay "And Say the Animal Responded" (in The Animal That Therefore I Am), Derrida makes clear his substitution of trace for signifier and the ensuing trouble this makes for signification. Where the Lacanian sub- ject can decide to pretend to pretend, to lie, to cover its tracks, to keep a secret - deci- sions which bespeak the language of present consciousness even as they purportedly deliver the letter of the Unconscious, and supersede the animal in so doing - Derrida reminds us that "the structure of the trace presupposes that to trace amounts to erasing a trace as much as to imprinting it, all sorts of sometimes ritual animal practices, for example, in burial and mourning, associate the experience of the trace with that of the erasure of the trace" (Animal 138). While this will not amount to rendering humans identical with other animals, neither will it shore up the human/animal divide. Turning whose hellish now to nickname Cherryh: sticks. Union Secretly sets about populating the strategic Gehenna, ruination but abandoning of the planet the whose hellish nickname sticks. Secretly populating Gehenna, but abandoning the 40,000 humans and the cloned workforce, the "Azi," Union guesses that the ensuing chaos will mar the appropriation of that world: when the second major power-bloc, Alliance, finally land there, they will find no simple resource. Fast-tracking knowl- edge, allaying anxiety, instilling values, Union settlers land prepared by "tape" and with the machines to replay the tape's wisdom. However, it is not only their aban- donment without further communication or supplies by Union that leads to the deconstruction of the human encampment, but also contact with the dominant indigenous species. (I use the term deconstruction advisedly, in the non-literal, theo- retical sense). Conceding that this species does have unusually large brains, previous study reassured that "all [they] do [...] is build ridges" and seek out fish (257). The inhabitants, who are seen as indeterminate lizard-like forms inhabiting a planet "not honor'd with a human shape," in Shakespeare's phrase ("The Tempest" 1.2.282-83), are named "caliban" by Union.4</page><page sequence="8">170 Mosaic 44/3 (September 201 1 ) 2.

Rather they find, to their disorientation, that in battle they are present less to lead than to act as living shields for the vulnerable caliban neck. And while there are competing efforts on the part of the eventual Alliance expedition to read the now "post- and pre-human" culture as an inevitable resurgence of a Levi-Straussian model of kinship, based on carno-phallogo-centrism, the most telling encounter emerges between a female "starman" and a young female co-leader of the interspecies com- munity. While seduction is not outside the relation, it is not the familiar narrative sug- gested by this heteronormative imprint. The Azi are both more reliant on tape than "born-men" (they are considered to be more like machines themselves), and yet also more prepared for their disappear- ance. En route to Gehenna their world view is reorganized by tape; they are told they will become more and more like born-men, understood as autonomous, and that they will produce children not as new Azi service personnel but as born-men. The tapes also tell them that the "highest life native to the world are the calibans," and that "if you understand them they will do you no harm" (265). Far from leaving the Azi to regress to the imagined virtues of untrammelled experience, the tape projects its pro- gram by fuelling a new desire - to be like, in fact to become, a born-man. This implies the lack of further instalments of new or replayed tape. The tape proposes a mirror image that the Azi newly recognize as their destination. "Understanding" the caliban covers all bases, since they transpire to be a greater challenge to human occupation of the planet than realized. Understanding them and becoming autonomous born-men, however, does not quite square. Observing caliban terrain by their ridges and mounds, the human settlement is founded close to one of them. For some time their own connection with native species is through the smaller lizards they named ariels, silly fluttering things so per- sistently companionate they become instant pets. When the mounds appear within newly human terrain, the humans, afraid of being undermined, hunt a few calibans to draw a line and signal territory. But the calibans breach the camp borders never- theless. And while they too draw lines, with stones, joining this to that, re-arranging existing structures, their behaviour is seen only as the rote remnant of some instinct or another. By the time Alliance finally lands on Gehenna, fifty-eight years later, the camp is abandoned by humans: mounds and ridges describe another surface. With painful irony, the humans that Alliance find are so altered as to warrant the non-interference</page><page sequence="10">172 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) protocol of a "first-contact" situation. Alliance rebuild a human encampment from which to observe the new-old communities. They watch without "interfering" by giving technology or telling of what it might do to quicken life, thinking that observation is neutral, that recording instruments do not also write as they direct emphasis. Alliance waits, assuming a necessary time of maturation, until they can confirm that they are watching their own prehistory return to its natural path: they wait until the Gehennans's notional weakness, immaturity, catches up with what should be their proper image in developed humanity. Writing does not spell but breaks that teleological tale. Humans now pattern with stones. The Calibans undermine the foundations of the new camp. Alliance observe. It takes another 150 years for the suspicion that there is interspecies communication to shift into recognition that not only is this the case but that the calibans write in Derrida's iterative and postal sense. They have always been writing on, in, and with the earth, and the settlers, with their walls and towers, have unwittingly responded.5 Alliance cannot thus retreat within their own perimeter as the place in which they can "remain human": their walls sign a world where subterranean countersignatures might emerge at any point (386). There can be no perimeter of their own. Consequently, fears of Alliance's technological interference with this ostensibly post- and pre-technological community are as nothing, since, as Alliance xenologist Elizabeth MaGee recognizes, they already "are technological" (53 1).6 Calibans grasp the world through writing on its surface with ridges, spirals, mounds, and now towers, appropriating the stone-patterning mimicry of the ariels as "living computers" with which to store and circulate information (531). They are not the namesakes of Ariel, then, in service to Prospero; rather, they live up to their homonym aerial, with an "e," telegraphing information to all who listen.7 Or perhaps they are moles. Shifting, re-arranging, tunnelling, the calibans breach the surface of Gehenna, proceeding, we could say with Freud after Derrida, "after a mole-like progression, after the subterranean toil of an impression" (Derrida, "Freud" 214). This mole-like progression is the unavoidable animal metaphor of which Royle reminds Derrida. Unlike the dog stories with which I began, Royle is not out to undermine Freud per se, but rather to dig a little deeper. In its published form - demanding attention to writing - Royle's "Mole" proceeds through a series of parentheses. Parentheses: the passage of a tunnel. The tunnelling of a mole figures there not simply as a borrowed ground but as that which blindly burrows through Royle's own writings, re-marked through the improperly large brackets of the parentheses: readers cannot simply plough through them without taking stock, revisiting the relations of "inside" and "outside" the "text," direction and deviation. Excavating the name mole as much as the traces of tunnels, Royle tells us that mole has been a synonym for mooncalf ' and moon-</page><page sequence="11">Lynn Turner 173 calf- - the abortive fetus of a cow - was a derogatory term used for any "monstrous" thing, including Shakespeare's Caliban (248). Uncanny. Uncanny too is the dawning sense, given this subterranean toil, of the difficulty in locating the mole, and that, per- haps, there is a mole in me (and you) (244). This tunnelling is not the expression of a power, even if it is that of a force - whether of caliban, mole, or human. As Derrida writes, "Force produces meaning (and space) through the power of 'repetition' alone which inhabits it originarily as its death. This power, that is, this lack of power, [...] makes possible what we call 'lan- guage'" ("Freud" 213). Language is, of course, in inverted commas (graphics not far from those of the fossors of parentheses). Force is forgotten by those landing on this world as anything except the marshalling of power through technological or biologi- cal might. It is repressed as an agency of repression signalling a lack of power or abil- ity. Force as lack of power reminds us of the earlier discussion of Lacan's immature infant. There is a crucial distinction. The weakness of deconstruction is not the spring that vouchsafes signification and is thereby left definitively behind, but weakness is its perennial condition - erasure within every repetition, death in life. Making the earth move, the calibans perform the scene of writing, "Like," as Derrida says, "all those who write" ("Freud" 229). Extending writing beyond the proper of the human is no anthropomorphic trans- ference, however, since its conditions fracture the response-ability thought to charac- terize "man" and direct his communications, and instead share the grounds thought to have been reserved for animals and machines (or animal-machines). And while the "like" of a metaphoric comparison brings those who write together, this cannot bring a communion of presence, of instant translatability, since metaphor's own assumed stability is in question. There is no present "this" to be securely transferred to a com- parison with "that." Subterranean toil soils metaphor's clean transitions. The belated turning points in Forty Thousand in Gehenna , when the calibans' writing is recognized as such, come firstly from MaGee's general immersion within one of the Gehennan communities when she intuits a broad interspecies communi- cation at work in patterning. Second, and more crucially, "after a caliban-like pro- gression," MaGee is submerged not in human-like dwelling on the planet's face, but within the tunnels underground. Like one of the earlier descendants of the first settlers brought underground by the caliban, she learns that the dark earth - inverse of white paper or neutral screen - is not virgin or maternal surface on which technical writing machines make their marks and take their transcendent distance, nor is it absolute absence of sense-making.8 This is not because the earth is alive as it shifts and is shifted, and thus is opposed to death as technological supplementation (Derrida,</page><page sequence="12">174 Mosaic 44/3 (September 2011 ) "Freud" 228). Rather, cut off from her habituated scenography of a face-to-face, ver- bal exchange, MaGee is jolted out of a communication assumed to take place in the present. This Gehennan earth might allow infinite receptivity to impressions, but traces are as likely to be erased as engraved. Very close to the scene of analysis, MaGee enters a new but perhaps "strangely familiar" transference. Repetition here is not bound to a past present, an affect out of time but otherwise intact. The lasciviousness of this uncanny return opens a multitude of impressions in the delay of this dark séance , the life-death of "intra-uterine life," to rephrase Freud. Her present gives way and she finds that she will always have been "several in order to write, and even to 'perceive'" (Derrida, "Freud" 226). If co-habiting with the caliban substitutes for taking tape, this is not a resurgence of the Cartesian animal-machine, of inert mechanism exterior to psychic life con- strued as organic and as human. In the "taupology"9 of Forty Thousand in Gehenna , the assumed boundaries between species, and between what we call living and non- living, have already been breached.10 NOTES 1/ The series includes Heavy Time, Rimrunners, Merchanter's Luck, Downbelow Station, Finity's End, Cyteen, and Regenesis, among others. 2/ H.D.'s (Hilda Doolittle) animal adventures in analysis are touched on in Sarah Jackson's rather teasing recent article, "Touching Freud's Dog " Angelaki 15.2 (2010): 187-201. 3/ And neither did Jo-fi "sit quietly," as in Peter Gay's peaceful account of the canine companion to the analytic session (Genosko 6). 4/ "Caliban" is a near anagram of "cannibal." 5/ Reminiscent of Claude Levi-Strauss's fears about introducing writing to those whom he thinks do not already possess it, examined by Derrida in Of Grammatology (101-40). 61 Sensitive to the too-simple lure of anthropomorphism, Cherryh never provides translations of caliban writing. 7/ Ariel serves Prospero in The Tempest. 8/ Jin is forcibly recruited to listen to the earth.
