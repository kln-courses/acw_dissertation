<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANCESTRY OF THE DIVINE BOAT (SIRSIR ?) OF EARLY DYNASTIC AND AKKADIAN GLYPTIC HELENE J. KA NTOR, University of Chicago THE evidence accumulating for the art of the Protoliterate period is making more and more evident the astounding extent to which the themes and stylistic alter- natives characteristic for the later Mesopotamian tradition already appeared in this tremendously creative period. Among the cylinder seal impressions from a Proto- literate locus at Chogha Mish, in Khuzistan, is an example of an unexpected motif: two antithetical boats with prows in human form (figs. 1 and 2).1 The curving shape of the boat is dominant; short legs are added to the hull at an angle; only some slight convex contours of the prow suggest human bodies. However, the arms and heads at the tops of the prows and their action leave no doubt as to the anthropomorphization of the boats. Although the Chogha Mish impression does not preserve an altogether complete rolling of the seal, there is no difficulty in restoring the symmetrical composition (fig. 2). The personified boats drink from two straws which are inserted into a bag-like container and pass above the raised arms of the boats. These were most probably clasped, as suggested in figure 2, but this detail is obscured by the lumpy surface of the ancient impression (fig. 1). Large jars of a type well known in Protoliterate glyptic, resting on stands and perhaps set into carrying cases equipped with large loop handles, fill the space above the boats. These jars could be indications of the cargo in the boats but are more likely to be merely space-fillers that are in general consonant with the main motif. Such jars are used in a similar manner on another seal design from Chogha Mish.2 The rough and uneven clay surface on which the cylinder seal with the personified boats was rolled produced an impression that probably did not originally do justice to the modeling of the original and is also now much worn. Clearly, however, the repre- sentation takes its stylistic character from the bulky and bold shapes arranged sym- metrically so as to cover the surface with an even weight of pattern. There is little refinement of outline or detail, except for the interwoven drinking tubes and arms, which together with the bag-like container provide a strongly marked axis for the composition. It represents the formal and relatively unrealistic side of Protoliterate glyptic. The representation of the Chogha Mish sealing anticipates two themes well known in later Mesopotamian glyptic although never found together. One is the motif of either a single figure or two antithetical ones drinking from a large jar through tubes. [Helene J.

The other, and more complicated, motif is the boat with an anthropomorphic prow, the earliest examples of which have so far been those on Early Dynastic II and III seals." The head and arms emerge from the prow so that the human elements still remain very much merged with the boat, almost more so than on the Chogha Mish sealing since no legs are shown. However, although in general the Early Dynastic seals are sketchily rendered, they still provide elaborate details which set the motif into a specific context. The anthropomorphic prow now holds a punting pole and wears the horns of divinity. Moreover, the boat has also usually become the vehicle for a seated god, who is surrounded by his attributes: a plow, a pot, and a wingless sphinx. The appearance of the anthropomorphized boat as a god and as the bearer of an even more important god is the great innovation of the Early Dynastic period. There is no evident sign of divinity in the Chogha Mish boats and, in general, anthropomorphic deities seem to have been very rarely, if at all, rendered in Protoliterate art. 3 P.

FIG. 2.-Restored drawing of design on Chogha Mish 9.872 The Early Dynastic renderings lead directly to those of the Akkadian period.6 Although there are no major innovations, in consonance with the predilection for organic unity and realism characteristic for much of Akkadian art, in some late Akkadian seals the anthropomorphic prow appears as a complete and muscular figure striding forward with one leg and with only the other merged into the hull of the boat. After the Akkadian period, the divine boat disappears from the artistic repertory, as do so many of the other mythological themes of Akkadian glyptic. The boat god of the Early Dynastic and Akkadian seals provides a general parallel for the deity Sirsir, who has long been known from later texts and whose character and origins have been discussed by B. Landsberger.7 In an Old Babylonian list of deities Sirsir appears as the boatman of Ea, which suggests a possible identity with the divine boats known earlier on seals. Two considerations cast some doubt on such an equation. In the Early Dynastic and Akkadian seals the god seated in the divine boat has none of the familiar attributes of Ea, but does occasionally appear with the flames of Shamash. Furthermore, Landsberger pointed out that Sirsir's appearance in Ea's retinue must be a secondary development since much later, in the Neo-Babylonian period, Sirsir was equated with Marduk, an association indicating that the scribes were still imbued with a sense of Sirsir's high rank. Now, important new evidence is available. The name of Sirsir occurs on Early Dynastic III tablets from Tell Abu Sala- bikh as a god being praised in the Za-mi Hymn, indicating that Sirsir must have been a major deity.8 In this case was he too important to serve as the transport of another god, however exalted? If, indeed, that was the case, what deity was then represented by the anthropomorphized boat? The correspondence between the written evidence and 6 R. M.

Landsberger suggested that Sirsir was the main deity of a port city on the Persian Gulf and the protagonist in heroic deeds, among which may have been a struggle with a sea monster that after its defeat served as a boat.9 Such an ancestry for the divine boat is now made unlikely by the Chogha Mish impression with personified boats. In the outburst of creativity characteristic for the early Protoliterate period, the human elements added to the hull of a boat must have expressed the significant role of boats in daily life,'o warfare," and ritual,12 as well as the general human tendency to person- ify them. But it took the lively imagination of Protoliterate seal cutters to visualize personified boats whose human prows drink so wholeheartedly. While this activity, incongruous with the watery environment of boats, was in later glyptic indulged in only by human beings, the motif of the anthropomorphized boat provided the basis for one of the striking mythological representations of Early Dynastic and Akkadian art. 9 Landsberger, "Der Schiffergott Sirsir," p. 366. 10 Amiet, La Glyptique, pls. 13 bis, G and 15, 260 (fishing).
