<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS how much he trades with his neighbors. Towle's book not only fills a long need for a summary of useful plants of pre-Columbian Peru, but will aid anyone who wants to study plants today in fields and markets, wherever In- dian cultures persist, from Mexico to central Chile. She has done an excellent job of identifying difficult materials and surveying a scattered literature notable for errors in identifications of plant materials. Towle is a Research Fellow in the Botanical Museum of Harvard University and for the past 15 years has been identifying collec- tions from excavations in western South America. The Botanical Museum has a long tradition of work in useful plants and remarkable collections of specimens and refer- ence works. The past director, Oakes Ames, wrote Econ- omic Annuals as well as many works on orchids; staff members have written the best-known text on economic botany and many papers on native drugs, rubber, grasses, corn, and other useful plants; the present director, Paul Mangelsdorf, is the recognized authority on the origin of corn. This book begins with a simple description of the geog- raphy and cultural setting of Peru. Most of the book is devoted to descriptions, occurrences, and uses of about 100 plants found in pre-Columbian sites in Peru. Refer- ences are made to material cited by earlier authors, to the many papers by Towle, and to unpublished studies, es- pecially to those of the Huaca Prieta collections of Junius Bird. Identifications made in earlier works are verified, questioned, or corrected, and the criteria used in identi- fication are sometimes discussed. References to publica- tions and to identifications made by specialists make it possible to have confidence in the names applied. The scientific names include the valid name, place of publi- cation, and common synonyms which have made the literature so confusing. The most frequently encountered common names are given, with their sources and, occa- sionally, a discussion of their origin. The drawings in Plates I-IV are excellent and will help one to know and identify materials. Most valuable are the illustrations of the edible part and the starch grains of some common root, tuber, and rhizome crops. Very few herbaria or museum collections have examples of these. Unfortunately, there are no figures of four other earth vegetables frequently encountered in Peruvian fields and markets: arracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza), papa lisa or ulluca (Ullucus tuberosus), yacon (Polymnia son- chifolia), and anu (Tropaeolum tuberosum). Explana- tions for the ten good plates of pottery reproductions of plant forms would have been improved by the addition of scientific names. "Warty squash," for example, is rather vague, as warty squashes are found in the three most com- mon cultivated species of squashes. "Warty squash" is listed in the index and can be found in the text as a common name for Cucurbita moschata. The word "tun- ta," however, which identifies Plate XV, B, is not listed in the index, nor mentioned in the text where there is a good short description of the two forms of dried pota- toes, chufio and moray, or tuna. Only chufio and moray are indexed. The last part of the text discusses plant materials chronologically for each of several geographical divisions, except for the "Epoch of Pre-Agriculture," which is de- scribed for the central Andes as a whole. It summarizes the evidence for agriculture and for plant use in Peru and, when used with the discussions under the individual plants, gives a fairly good idea of the vegetal resources of ancient Peru. For one who is only slightly familiar with Peruvian archaeological periods, it may be somewhat diffi- cult to compare the discussions of the various areas with- out referring to other publications. A chart showing the relationships of the cultures in the various areas and plants known for each period would have been a great help. There is a good short bibliography and an index with remarkably few omissions. HUGH CUTLER Missouri Botanical Garden and Washington University St. Louis, Mo. Essays in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology. SAMUEL K. LOTHROP AND OTHERS (27 essays). Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1961. viii + 507 pp., 230 figs., 4 tables, 2 charts. $12.50. Difficult to review - but delightful to read - are these essays presented in recognition of Samuel K. Lothrop's many-faceted and productive interests in American pre- history. A pleasantly novel feature is the inclusion of two articles by the honoree himself. His introductory essay is composed of retrospective musings on the physical, technical, and organizational differences between archaeo- logical undertakings of early and recent decades, roughly 1915-1930 versus 1945-1960. There is much wisdom tucked into this seemingly casual article which serves as a reflector for one's thoughts while reading through the book. Lothrop's second article i.s scholarly in tone and intent, and will be mentioned again in due course. The editors are Junius B. Bird, Gordon F. Ekholm, Doris Z. Stone, and Gordon R. Willey. They have wisely arranged the essays, differing widely in subject matter and areal focus, along north to south itineraries. Beginning with Lothrop's first article, (No. 1) Archaeology, Then and Now, and a generalized essay by George Kubler, (No. 2) On the Colonial Extinction of the Motifs of Pre- Columbian Art, the locales move to Mexican and Mayan areas, thus: (No. 3) Fine Metalwork in Pre-Conquest Mexico by Dudley T. Easby, Jr.; (No. 4) The Olmecs, Artists in Jade by M. W. Stirling; (No. 5) The Squier Jades from Tonind, Chiapas, by Elizabeth K. Easby; (No. 6) Portraits of Women in Maya Art by Tatiana Proskouriakoff; (No. 7) Types of Ball Courts in the High- lands of Guatemala by A. Ledyard Smith; (No. 8) Ball- game Handstones and Ball-game Gloves by Stephen F. de Borhegyi; and (No. 9) Pottery of the Holmul I Style from Barton Ramie by Gordon R. Willey and James C. Gifford. 257</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Three short reports follow: (No. 10) Notes on a Plum- bate Vessel with Shell Inlay and on Chiclero's Ulcer by J. Eric S. Thompson; (No. 11) A Possibly Unique Type of Formative Figurine from Guatemala by A. V. Kidder and E. M. Shook; and (No. 12) A Figurine Cache from Kino Bay, Sonora, by Frederick J. Dockstader. Central American topics are: (No. 13) The Stone Sculpture of Costa Rica by Doris Z. Stone; (No. 14) Some Costa Rican Jade Motifs by Carlos Balser; (No. 15) Grave Associations and Ceramics in Veraguas, Panama by Joy Mahler. (See also No. 18.) Colombia and Peru are represented by several essays: (No. 16) Anthropomorphic Figurines from Colombia, Their Magic and Art by Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff; (No. 17) Pre,Columbian Metalwork of Colombia and Its Neighbors by William C. Root; (No. 18) Peruvian Stylistic Impact on Lower Central America by Samuel K. Lothrop; (No. 19) A Cupisnique Bird Jar by Geoffrey Bushnell; (No. 20) Paracas and Nazca Iconography by Alan R. Sawyer; (No. 21) Textile Designing and Sam- plers in Peru by Junius B. Bird; and (No. 22) The Chron- ology of Inca Wooden Cups by John Howland Rowe. The last five essays move from the Caribbean to Pata- gonia, thus: (No. 23) The Bailey Collection of Stone Arti- facts from Puerto Rico by Irving Rouse; (No. 24) Puerto Rican Stone "Collars" as Ball-game Belts by Gordon F. Ek- holm; (No. 25) An Experimental Formulation of Horizon Styles in the Tropical Forest Area of South America by Betty J. Meggers and Clifford Evans; (No. 26) The La Agu- ada Culture of Northwestern Argentina by Alberto Rex Gonzales; and (No. 27) Observations on the Painted De- signs of Patagonian Skin Robes by Carl Schuster. The volume is well edited, printed, and illustrated - satisfactory in every respect except for a peculiar reference system. Each essay is numbered. The bibliography for each essay is assembled under its number between pages 449 and 483. Then follow, in similar groupings, the notes for each essay between pages 485 and 507. Usually a reader wants notes first, bibliography second, and prefer- ably placed together. A solution to this separation and reversal of references for a text is to keep two stiff book- marks in the pertinent pages at the rear of the volume. Once this manual problem is solved the reader can hap- pily play the field, selecting essays topically germane to each other rather than in numbered order. For example, those dealing with jade (Nos. 4, 5, 14), metalwork (Nos. 3, 17), figurines (Nos. 11, 12, 16), or ball courts and ball game equipment (Nos. 7, 8, 24) are obvious comparative readings. Rowe's study of Inca wooden cups may be read against Kubler's classifications of contact processes de- structive to native art (Nos. 2, 22), as to some extent, may Schuster's remarks on the transfer of painted de- signs from guanaco skins to horse hides (No. 27, p. 422). This reviewer feels that theories of extinction-survival processes can best be derived from a series of specific, controlled analyses (like Rowe's), rather than from the amorphous circumstances of contact situations which sooner or later suppress, transform, or extinguish native arts. The pre-Conquest conditions under which an art flourished are also factors in its survival potential which cannot be ignored when considering its viability in a post-Conquest milieu. Erudition, perspicacity, and logic are manifest in Pros- kouriakoff's brilliant identification of the elusive female figures in Maya art (No. 6). Their costumes and coiffures, though often like men's, are betrayed by asso- ciated glyph elements, and have characteristics congruent with those of known Mesoamerican women's dress. This lucid study adds a human dimension to our slight knowl- edge of Mayan life: no ancient people have so thoroughly concealed themselves behind a rich fagade of idealized representations of the controlling elite. Lothrop relates certain design elements in Central American goldwork and ceramics to Paracas, Mochica, and Tiahuanaco prototypes (No. 18). He concludes that since diffusion northward must have been by sea, and since seaworthy craft were not fully developed until Coast Tiahuanaco times, the older design elements sur- vived in Peru until then. Meggers and Evans' trial formulation of horizon styles in the Tropical Forest area (No. 25) is a type of assess- ment which aids the progress of study and is too often eschewed today. A publishable appraisal of assembled yet incomplete data is a contribution to knowledge and a stimulus to colleagues as well. Frankly speculative papers are the only substitute for "talking it over," which sel- dom can be done today by a numerous and far-flung body of co-workers. Similarly, Gonzalez's reappraisal of the Barreales culture (No. 26), resulting in two sub-divisions - Cienaga (ear- lier) and La Aguada (later) - will be welcomed by all archaeologists concerned with cultural relationships in southern Andean prehistory. Returning to Lothrop's introductory essay, one might note the importance of the foundations laid in the "then" of archaeological research for the interpretations of the "now." The pioneer efforts established a broad viewpoint and a concern for sound evidence as essential standards which have supported the complex growth of modern problems in American prehistory. Not only have condi- tions of field work and techniques of dating improved. The careful, incremental accumulation of knowledge about past civilizations now permits consideration of prob- lems earlier investigators certainly envisaged, but had neither the time nor means to solve. Archaeologists to- day can concern themselves with the interpretation of their materials as living culture, as human expressions: "their meaning to the people who made and wore them," as E. K. Easby says of the Squier jades (No. 5, p. 80). Reichel-Dolmatoff illumines figurines of the past with the light of contemporary Choc6 and Cuna shamanistic prac- tices (No. 16), while Bird tells us how ancient textile de- signers set about their work (No. 21). Lothrop's distinguished career is a continuum from "then" till "now." No single investigator has contributed more to both the basic and the specialized aspects of Latin-American prehistory.

A. H. GAYTON University of California Berkeley, Calif. The Ancient Sun Kingdoms of the Americas: Aztec, Maya, Inca. VICTOR W. VON HAGEN. World Publishing Co., Cleveland, 1961. 620 pp., frontis., 164 figs., 54 pls. (4 in color). $12.50. In a bygone age, explorers of Latin America's ancient cultures travelled through lands where dense jungles, wild animals, and poisonous snakes abounded, where very real dangers beset the paths of such men as Humboldt, Stephens, Catherwood, and Squier. Today's would-be archaeologist, while safely ensconced in his armchair, must struggle with equal perils, when cliches hang like palm vipers from every page, misplaced similes are thrown across his trail, and the mists of hyperbole cloud his vision. In the attempt to "bring to life" the dry-as-dust bones of our early civilizations, how many popular archae- ology books these days obscure the very subjects they are treating by interlarding their text with learned literary references and poems by second-rate laureates? Why must we be told that Tikal is to be compared to a Tschaikovsky symphony, or Palenque to a piece by Mo- zart? Surely we might expect books written on peoples like the Aztec, Maya, or Inca to present these remark- able cultures in their own terms. The latest offering in this genre is von Hagen's new trilogy, actually published separately over the last few years in paperback form. None of the defects of the previous editions, amply reviewed in these and other pages, are missing from the present compilation. How- ever, let us grant that the author has read widely, not necessarily in American anthropology and archaeology: among others, we find cited Brillat de Savarin, Remy de Gourmont, Nietzsche, Anatole France, Roger Fry, Thomas Mann, Spengler, Charles Doughty, Baudelaire, Herbert Spencer, Balzac, Samuel Pepys, Archimedes, George Sand, and Dr. Johnson. Aldous Huxley is invoked no less than 15 times. To encompass subject matter as broad as three of the great New World civilizations within a single cover, one must of course have a recurrent leitmotif (one hesitates to call it a theory). Von Hagen's is set forth on p. 37 and appears to be a kind of Ellsworth Huntington geopolitik: Everything has its reasons - whether they are geographical or sociological. Imperialist cultures were born out of the harsh lands. In the tropic lands where man luxuriated in warmth and sensualism, the expansion mood was limited, but the man who came out of the high country, scoured by wind and hail, was the one with imperialistic ambitions - an effect of geography. We see this approach taken to its logical conclusion on pp. 405-6, when von Hagen provides the explanation for what are said to be the differing theogonies of coastal and highland Peru. On the coast: "Since here the sun was always menacing and was not to be appeased, they select- ed as their principal deity the moon, which controlled the sea." In the highlands: "Since the life-giving sun was life- warming, it became their principal deity." If geographi- cal determinism is inadequate to explain a custom, then one must cite the "primitive" mentality of the Indians, as on p. 353, "The Mayas thought of the gods as do all primitives; p. 358, "Blood has for all primitives a mysti- cal significance; or p. 362, "The Mayas were dominated by fear and superstition." Even the glands have played their role on the stage which von Hagen has set for us. One of the great factors in New World culture history has been none other than Die Erdmutter, the slave of her hormones: p. 72 (on Aztec women), "Then as now woman's power was based on sex; she controlled mostly by her organism; she was given the privileges which men con- cede when they are intoxicated by the fumes of desire." p. 246 (on Maya women), "Instinctively, when they were born they were already old, more rooted to the earth than man. Man made history but woman is history, and Maya women knew that the great Maya calendar had first been based on her menstrual cycles." p. 553 (on Inca women), "Woman was man's oldest beast of burden. She was the carrier, allowing the men to be free to fight. This was true in the beginnings of every old culture." But von Hagen is not uncritical about some of the more radical theories of New World prehistory; special scorn is reserved for Thor Heyerdahl and his Kon-Tiki expedition. There is a kind of critical scholarship which can be detected in these pages, particularly of the Buffa- lo-Bill-never-shot-a-buffalo school (p. 29, "The Aztecs, of course, did not call themselves 'Aztecs' . . . Still the 'Tenochas' [sic], called 'Aztecs' . . ."; or p. 197, "'Maya' was, naturally, not their name"). This reviewer pleads fatigue in excusing himself from enumerating separately all the mistakes of fact or typog- raphy contained in this volume. Let us confine ourselves to the major outlines of each section. For the Aztec, von Hagen has clearly based himself on Vaillant's Aztecs of Mexico and is apparently unfamiliar with much of the research undertaken by such scholars as Caso, Barlow, Kirchhoff, and Monz6n on the social and political organization of Tenochtitlan. Vaillant, instead of turning to the original sources on Mexican history, re- lied on the faulty interpretations of Morgan and Bande- lier, who saw Mexican society as primitive and demo- cratic, and Moctezuma as no more than a tribal chief. That this is all wrong is now clear, but von Hagen blithely continues to place quotes around "king" and "empire" when downgrading the Aztec in the name of Vaillant. Even the chapter labeled "Pre-Aztec Cultures" is a creaky welding together of Vaillant's outdated scheme, in which the Toltec are credited with Teotihuacan, with scraps of more recent archaeology. One looks in vain in the Bib- liography for the greatest source of all on the Aztec, 259</page></plain_text>
