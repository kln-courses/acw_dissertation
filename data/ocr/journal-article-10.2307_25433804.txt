<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iyes? Complexes: Reexamining Perceptions of Tradition in Cuban Iyes? Music Kevin M. Delgado This essay examines specific music and religious rituals within the Cuban religion commonly known as Santer?a or Regla de Ocha/Ocha. Focusing upon the rhythms, liturgy, musical instruments, and traditions introduced to Cuba by the Iyes? (the Cuban descendents of the ?j?s? people of Nigeria), this work attempts a critical historiography of one ethnic component of the Santer?a /Ocha religion. In Cuba, two Afro-Cuban cabildos (family-based, lodge-type ritual associations) affiliated with Iyes? ancestry preserve music traditions that were established in Cuba by their ancestors during the mid nineteenth century. In addition to summarizing the cabildos' traditions, this study pursues questions regarding the origins and (re)formations of Iyes? culture vis-?-vis the mainstream Santer?a milieu. Because modern Iyes? traditions are linked to Santer?a yet in many ways remain distinct from its mainstream practices, differences embodied by Iyes? traditions are sometimes viewed as evidence of an incomplete tradition, one marred by erosion and loss. I view the specific ethnic origins of these Iyes? cabildos and their relatively old age as a unique perspective from which to view Santer?a /Ocha practices and liturgy, arguing that select Iyes? cabildo tra ditions may not reflect loss but may predate the modern Santer?a religion itself. Through a comparison between the two extant Iyes? cabildos, I ex amine how Iyes? liturgy is represented within the Santer?a /Ocha religion and in Cuban folkloric music expressions, exploring why one cabildo is portrayed as the exclusive bearer of "true" Iyes? liturgy at the expense of the other. Finally, through an interdisciplinary triangulation of ethnographic data, organology, and previous scholarship on Cuban and Nigerian history Kevin M. Delgado is an assistant professor of music and the coordinator of world music and ethnomusicology at San Diego State University. A bassist and percussionist, Delgado's primary research focuses on the music, performance, and cultural representation of the Afro-Cuban Santer?a /Regla de Ocha religion.

The Iyes? in Cuba Iyes? culture is considered part of the Santer?a/Ocha religion, whose devotees honor West African divinities known as oricha (oris? in Nigeria).1 Although elements of European Catholic and Spiritist practices are used by santeros (Santer?a practitioners), the vast majority of the religion's content is West African, brought to Cuban shores during the transatlantic slave trade. Cuban descriptions of Santeria's African origins focus upon Lucumi culture, a colo nial designation applied to a variety of related West African ethnicities whose homelands were located primarily in what is now known as Yorub?land in Nigeria.2 While Lucumi can be considered a cultural aggregate of related West African ethnic peoples primarily from Yorub?land (e.g., Oy?, ?kit?, ?j?bu, etc.), in Cuba these ethnic components were largely subsumed into a collective Lucumi religious identity by the early twentieth century. Today, the term Lucumi designates cultural origins of spiritual practices more than retained ethnicity, and while Santer?a/Ocha liturgy consists of hundreds of Lucumi words, Lucumi may more accurately be described as a ritual lexicon than a language (Wirtz 2005,2007; Vincent 2006,249-269). Maintenance of a distinct ethnic designation by oricha houses or cabildos within the general domain of Lucumi religion is very uncommon today, although the two extant Iyes? cabildos provide examples of this phenomenon. The Iyes? were the Cuban descendents of the ?j?s? people of Nigeria, an ethnic group whose territory lies approximately 125 kilometers inland from the Bight of Benin and who are today considered to be a subgroup of the Yorub? people.3 The Iyes? were never a sizeable group in Cuba, and i. In this essay, I shall privilege conventional Cuban spelling of Cuban deities, objects, and rituals rather than their Nigerian Yorub? cognates when speaking of a Cuban setting (e.g., ori cha instead of the Anglicized orisha or the Nigerian oris?). I shall use Standard Yorub? spellings when speaking of Yorub? culture in a Nigerian setting (e.g., the African ?j?s? versus the Cuban Iyes?). 2. See Ortiz (1996,21,31,36), Guanche (1996,56-57), and L?pez Vald?s (1998,339-343) for non-Yorub? ethnicities that were included under the Lucumi designation. 3. Here I speak of Iyes? in the past tense due to my interaction with Matanzas Iyes? cabildo members. Despite initially framing questions in terms of "the Iyes?/' I consistently received responses regarding "the cabildo" or "the family." I never once heard a cabildo member speak of the cabildo personnel collectively as "we Iyes?." For all its retention of Iyes? designations and rituals as a point of origin, the true organizing principles for Matanzas cabildo members today are patron oricha, cabildo, and family (particularly the surname Garcia), not ethnicity or African "nation." These organizing principles apply to the Sancti Spiritus cabildo as well.</page><page sequence="3">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 3 although they appear to have been classified often under the broad Lucumi category, they did exist in sufficient numbers during the nineteenth century to establish cabildos in several locales in the plantation-saturated sections of western and central Cuba, including the cities of Havana, Regla, Matanzas, Jovellanos, Trinidad, and Sancti Spiritus (see Fig. 1). Cabildos were institutions imported from the Iberian Peninsula. Au thorized by the Catholic Church and required to venerate a sponsoring Catholic saint, cabildos tended to be urban with a membership composed of free Afro-Cubans, who formed a small but sizeable portion of the Afro Cuban population by the early 1800s. It is important that cabildos were segregated according to ethnicity or "nation," and the resultant cabildos de naci?n provided ethnic-specific meeting places for free Afro-Cubans during the colonial era, thus facilitating the retention of specific African languages, rituals, and religions. Numerous factors caused the slave trade to wither by the early 1870s, which changed the nature of the cabildos. Initially composed of African born members, cabildo populations increasingly consisted of more het erogeneous Cuban-born individuals who possessed more multiethnic (if not multi-racial) identities rather than strictly ethnic-specific African ones (Brown 2003, 68). As slavery was phased out in the 1880s, the Afro Cuban cabildos de naci?n were increasingly restricted in their activities and eventually forced to reorganize (Ortiz 1921, 22-23). While many ca bildos disappeared, others transformed themselves into either religion based Afro-Cuban mutual aid societies or family-based houses of wor ship. These new houses and societies were typically organized by type of Afro-Cuban religion (e.g., Regla de Ocha, Regla de Palo/Palo Monte, etc.) and dedicated to a specific African divinity and corresponding Catholic Figure 1. Map of known Iyes? cabildos (map by Melodie Tune).</page><page sequence="4">4 BMR JOURNAL saint.4 Additionally, their membership increasingly drew from a general ized Afro-Cuban/Cuban population rather than from a specific African ethnicity. For the Lucumi/Santeria religion, these family-based houses, known as casa-templo (house-temple) in Spanish or ile-ocha (oricha house) in Lucumi, eventually became the organizational norm in what came to be known as the Santer?a /Regla de Ocha religion. Drawn from a variety of related practices, the religion's pantheon of divinities consists of ori cha from numerous related Lucumi ethnicities, whose collective worship coalesced into a quasi-stable system of religious practice in the early de cades of the twentieth century (Brown 2003). Many of the most prominent Santer?a/Ocha lineages in Cuba were created and/or "reformed" in this post-cabildo de naci?n era (Palmi? 2002, 231-232; Brown 2003, 62-112; Ramos 2003), with the ethnic-specific cabildos, such as ones identified as Iyes? rather than Lucumi, mostly disappearing or transforming them selves into family-based oricha houses during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The historical trajectories of known Iyes? cabildos reflect the fortunes of many colonial-era cabildos. For example, little is known regarding the existence of a Iyes? cabildo in Havana.5 Cuban scholar Fernando Ortiz refers to a single Havana cabildo of the past, but does not indicate when or where this cabildo existed. Cuban musicologist (and former assistant for Ortiz) Argeliers Le?n wrote of two defunct Iyes? cabildos in Havana (Le?n 1981), though it is unclear if Le?n included a nearby Regla cabildo as one of the two Havana cabildos (Regla is a working-class town just across the Bay of Havana from the capital city). The only physical evidence of the existence of a Havana cabildo lies in Havana's Museo Nacional de la M?sica, where a set of nineteenth-century Iyes? drums is displayed. These drums were likely taken from the cabildo in a police raid enforcing prohibitions against Afro-Cuban cabildo activities, a common action in the late 1890s and the early decades of the twentieth century (see Moore 1997; Brown 2003). Noth ing else is known regarding any Iyes? cabildo in Havana. The cabildo in Regla, however, came to an abrupt end during the so-called Guerrita del Doce (Little War of [19] 12), a campaign against Afro-Cubans in response to armed protests by a banned Afro-Cuban political party (Helg 1995). As a result of tensions from the Guerrita del Doce and sensational accusations of murder involving Afro-Cubans, Regla witnessed consider 4. Palo Monte, also known as Palo Mayombe, Regla de Palo, or simply Palo, is an Afro-Cuban religion based on Congolese beliefs. 5. Despite the accent in the word Iyes?, it is most often pronounced "YE-sa" (with an ac cented first syllable), though in some sentence constructions it is pronounced "ye-SA", the i silent in both renditions. Following this pronunciation, I shall refer to "a" Iyes? drum rather than "an" Iyes? drum.</page><page sequence="5">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 5 able antiblack violence and hysteria during that year. Ortiz reported that, as a measure of the widespread fear among Afro-Cubans during 1912, the only Iyes? cabildo in Regla burned its drums and closed its cabildo (1954, 4:370-372). Ortiz added that "now and then," members of the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo "come to Regla with their Iyes? drums" to play their rhythms for "a Lucumi cabildo where habaneros of Iyes? ancestry gather" (ibid.). The lack of information about this Lucumi cabildo leads me to suspect this anecdote was told to Ortiz by cabildo members in Matanzas rather than by someone in the unnamed Havana Lucumi cabildo.6 Such an abrupt and coerced end was but one way a cabildo might cease to exist. More often, old cabildos or oricha houses disbanded due to so cietal and generational changes, particularly the loss of influential reli gious elders who served as authorities and gatekeepers of tradition. If the motivation to continue a particular tradition withered, or if ritual and liturgical knowledge was not passed on from the knowledgeable to the less experienced, the death of a respected elder could devastate a cabildo; this is especially true of an ethnic-specific cabildo (such as the Iyes?), whose pool of potential members would be much smaller than that of a typically multiethnic "oricha house." The loss of elders appears to be the cause of the demise of Iyes? cabildos in Jovellanos and Trinidad, located in the provinces of Matanzas and Sancti Spiritus, respectively. Matanzas scholar Israel Moliner Casta?eda visited the house of the defunct Jovellanos ca bildo in either 1977 or 1978. At that time, the house's occupants told him that the cabildo had not been active since the grandmother of the house had died some ten years earlier (Moliner Casta?eda 2000). Located near the south-central coast of the island, the Iyes? cabildo of Trinidad seems to have suffered a fate similar to that of the cabildo in Jovellanos. When visiting the cabildo in 1983, researchers from the Centro de Investigaci?n y Desarrollo de la M?sica Cubana (CIDMUC?the Center for the Investi gation and Development of Cuban Music) found a Iyes? cabildo that had been dormant for over ten years. Select elements of religious and musical traditions from the defunct Jovellanos and Trinidad Iyes? cabildos will be discussed later in this essay. Today, the only extant Iyes? cabildos are the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista in Matanzas, a city on Cuba's north coast approximately 100 kilometers east of Havana, and the Cabildo Santa B?rbara in Sancti Spiritus, a landlocked city in the island's central region. The two Iyes? 6. The song leaders and drummers of the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista in Ma tanzas occasionally still play for Santer?a /Ocha houses in Havana, but according to cabildo personnel I interviewed in 2000, these are ordinary Ocha houses that do not self-identify as houses of Iyes? descendants and are not perceived by cabildo members as being of Iyes? heritage.</page><page sequence="6">6 BMR JOURNAL cabildos are isolated from one another with no contact between their mem bers. Both cabildos were established in the nineteenth century and are among the oldest surviving cabildos on the island. Within their respective religious communities, both houses are respected as honorable guardians of old traditions and familial lineages, and each cabildo is viewed as a peripheral element of the surrounding Santer?a religious community. Yet because each cabildo does not enact significant Santer?a initiatory rituals, the cabildos are also viewed as not belonging to the religious mainstream of Santer?a/Ocha. Indeed, many santeros view these cabildos as archaic religious houses that "lack" proper rituals, their traditions incomplete, partially forgotten, and eroded. In the next section, I shall examine the history of each cabildo in order to discuss the putative incompleteness of their traditions and to create a framework for a subsequent examination of Iyes? music repertoires. Iyes? Cabildo History and Traditions vis-?-vis Mainstream Santer?a The Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista Located in Matanzas, the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista was found ed by free men of Iyes? (?j?s?) descent in 1830, during the peak of the Cuban slave trade and its associated plantation economy. Practically nothing is re called of specific African (Ij?s?) history by present cabildo members, though cabildo elders interviewed by Cuban scholar and folklorist Rogelio Mart?nez Fur? in the early 1960s claimed that the cabildo's founders came from the African town of Ibokun in ?j?s? territory, and that the women associated with the cabildo founders came from Ilesa, which was the center of power in the ?j?s? kingdom (1965,104). According to cabildo oral history, its African-born founders met one another in a Matanzas Lucumi cabildo called Cabildo Santa Teresa, which was dedicated to the oricha Ochun (?sun in Nigeria?female oricha of rivers, fresh water, motherhood, precious metal, and beauty). Ac cording to Iyes? cabildo president Ernesto Knight Garcia (1941-2004), the Cabildo Santa Teresa, which itself was founded in the eighteenth century and no longer exists, sponsored the creation of the current Matanzas Iyes? cabildo (Knight Garc?a 2000a, 2000c). Though the cabildo was initially organized in 1830, for unknown reasons it was apparently not independently established until at least fifteen years later. The exact year of the cabildo's full, independent establishment after the 1830 founding is unclear according to both Cuban scholars and cabildo sources, having been permanently established either in 1845,1846,1848, or</page><page sequence="7">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 7 18547 In Matanzas today, the Iyes? cabildo has the reputation of being one of the most "closed" ritual houses, particularly in comparison to the typical Santer?a casa-templo, which may be joined by anyone on good terms with the house and with a sincere desire to participate under the guidance of its spiritual leaders. Like some of the Iyes? cabildos mentioned earlier, the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo suffered during the mid-twentieth century due to waning membership. Indeed, scholar and folklorist Rogelio Mart?nez Fur?, who conducted research at the cabildo in the early 1960s, described the cabildo then as in "complete decline" (1979,140). Ernesto Knight (2000b) recalled that cabildo members were "too few" then, but added that the cabildo "opened" a bit in the 1960s by encouraging close friends to join, though in reality this had been happening on a limited basis for some time. This expanded pool of members, along with regular family members, al lowed the cabildo to continue with its modest size of participants. The spiritual "owner" of the cabildo, its primary spiritual patron, is the oricha Ogun (?gun in Nigeria): male oricha of war, iron, violent force, and mechanized technology. The cabildo honors Og?n on June 24, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, the Catholic saint associated with Ogun.8 Collec tively, the activities surrounding this celebration are referred to as El d?a de San Juan (Saint John's Day).9 Private rituals performed by the cabildo men honoring ancestors (Egun) occur during the night of June 23 and in the early 7- In 2000, Ernesto Knight Garcia cited the year 1846, while in 2007 the current cabildo president Jos? de los Reyes Portillo Garc?a (b.1932) cited 1848. The cabildo possesses a com memorative banner of uncertain age marking the creation year as 1830 and the establish ment date as 1848, reinforcing the statement of de los Reyes. Cuban musicologist Argeliers Le?n, whose fieldwork at the cabildo included at least a visit in the early 1950s and in 1977, reported the cabildo's year of establishment as 1854 (Le?n 1981). Cuban ethnologist and folklorist Rogelio Mart?nez Fur? gives 1845 as the year of the cabildo's establishment and is the only Cuban scholar who cites a separate date (1830) for the initial organization of the ca bildo (1965; 1979). Ernesto Knight Garcia mentioned to me that there was once a document recording the Iyes? cabildo's founding, but that document was lost long ago. Mart?nez Fur? had heard the same story in the 1960s and searched unsuccessfully in the city archives for the document (1979,137) 8. Colonial cabildos were required to organize under the banner of a patron saint. Saints became a necessary link between the official Catholicism of the island and the unofficial Afri can religion that persisted. Now, as then, annual oricha celebrations are held on the day of the oricha's corresponding Catholic saint. 9. My description of this event is based on observations of el d?a de San Juan in the years 2000, 2003, and 2005. El d?a de San Juan activities in June 2007 were canceled due to the illness of a cabildo member charged with organizational support, a development several cabildo members privately viewed as an unacceptable reason to cancel the festivities (which a few members stated had never happened before in their lifetimes). While the cabildo held no public drum festival (tambor) for Og?n that year, a modest procession for Saint John did occur at midnight, and many cabildo members visited the cabildo to pay their respects to Og?n at his altar.</page><page sequence="8">8 BMR JOURNAL hours of June 24. At the midnight change from June 23 to June 24, cabildo members honor Saint John with a modest procession, carrying the saint's statue at the front of a candlelit line of cabildo members, who follow behind while singing a song to the oricha Og?n. Such processions were likely very common in the colonial past but are rare for typical Ocha houses today. After the procession, cabildo members enact rituals "feeding" sacrificial offerings (ebo) to the cabildo's oricha objects, drums, and Egun objects, while con tinuing to prepare for the subsequent evening's events. Unlike the private midnight and all-night ritual actions, the cabildo's festivities on the night of June 24 are very public and are nearly identical to the corresponding rituals in mainstream Santer?a. Called tambor or toque de santo in Spanish and bemb? in Lucumi, these celebrations involve responsorial singing, polyrhythmic drumming, and mimetic dancing that honor the oricha, who may make themselves physically present by "mounting" a devotee through the phe nomenon known as spirit possession or possession trance. Though the cabildo is principally dedicated to the oricha Og?n, it al ways has honored Ochun as well. Besides being initially sponsored by a cabildo dedicated to Ochun, there was reportedly a female founder of the cabildo, the only female member in the cabildo's history: Carmen Garcia, a "daughter" (initiate) of Och?n. When she passed away, her sacred oricha objects were maintained by the cabildo, a practice that continues to this day. During some years, a separate celebration is held for Ochun on September 12, the day traditionally associated with Och?n's Catholic counterpart, La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (Our Lady of Charity of [the town of] Copper).10 During other years, a separate social gathering may be held in honor of Och?n on June 25, the day after Ogun's ritual celebrations, though observance of these separate activities honoring Och?n has waned in recent years. Both Og?n and Och?n have a strong presence in the African territory of the ?j?s?. The African Og?n, however, is not strictly a ?j?s? divinity and is widely known in Yorub?land and beyond. His legendary Yorub? homeland is Ire Ekiti in ?kit? territory, east of the ?j?s?, and festivals in his honor occur throughout the eastern forest regions of Yorub?land (Peel 1997). The African worship of ?sun is associated with the river bearing her name that flows from above the northern limits of ?j?s?land, southwest across what was northern ?j?s? territory during the era of the transatlantic slave trade, and south through ?j?bu territory to the Lagos lagoon. ?sun worship was once restricted to these areas before spreading beyond the confines of her river, 10. Affectionately known as "La Caridad," La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre is the patron saint of Cuba. While most oricha houses honor her on September 8, the cabildo maintains the older practice of using September 12.</page><page sequence="9">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 9 whereas Og?n worship is spread over a much larger territory. While men and male occupations, both traditional (e.g., hunter, soldier, blacksmith) and contemporary (e.g., drivers, railroad workers, mechanics), dominate the African worship of Og?n, African worship of ?sun (Och?n) emphasizes femaleness. These gendered tendencies find correspondence in the oricha practices of Cuban Santer?a, as men outnumber women in terms of Og?n worship and women outnumber men in Och?n worship (though it is very common for male devotees to be dedicated to an oricha identified as female and vice versa). According to Ernesto Knight, among the African-born cabildo founders were twenty-one babaiao (babal?wo in Nigeria): divination specialists, priests of the If? divination system and of Orula/Orumila, the oricha of destiny and anthropomorphic personification of If? knowledge crucial to the Santer?a/ Ocha religion. While Argeliers Le?n also cites twenty-one babaiao among the founders, Rogelio Mart?nez Fur? (1965,101-102) was told in the 1960s that the twenty-one founding men included fourteen babalaos and seven osainistas or olosains (priests of Osain, an oricha whose domain is the for est, plants, and their medicinal powers).11 Though dedicated to Og?n, the Matanzas cabildo has apparently always had a strong relationship with babaiao. According to the cabildo's lead drummer Mois?s Urrutia (b. 1946), the cabildo's drums are occasionally hired by babaiao in Havana for tambor celebrations (Urrutia 2000). Membership in the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo is restricted to men, unlike nearly all modern Lucumi cabildos or oricha houses (and unlike the other extant Iyes? cabildo). Though many cabildo men do not "have ocha" or have not "made ocha" (that is, they have not become fully initiated into Santer?a /Regla de Ocha), by virtue of their standing as cabildo members the cabildo men have a special relationship with the oricha Og?n and may view him as their patron. Additionally, a unique ritual occurs at the close of their annual tambor in honor of Og?n as the cabildo men take turns dancing, one by one, with a green scarf or cloth draped over the dancer's neck, before the Iyes? drums while songs are sung for Og?n. Importantly, each male associated with the cabildo dances before the cabildo's sacred drums whether or not he is a Santer?a initiate (typically only Santer?a initi ates are permitted to dance directly in front of sacred drums, though this is not the case in Yorub?land). To my knowledge, this particular dance ritual is not practiced in any other cabildo in Cuba. The exclusively male il. Mart?nez Fur? (1965, 102, 104) was impressed by the symbolism of the numbers of founding members, the degree of which he had never seen in any other Cuban cabildo. Not only do the numbers (7,14, totaling 21) consist of multiples of seven, the number sacred to the cabildo's patron oricha Og?n, but the number twenty-one itself is also sacred to Ogun in other aspects, including Og?n's altar and in Lucumi initiation rites.</page><page sequence="10">10 BMR JOURNAL worship of Ogun in the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo suggestively echoes the male-dominated socio-occupational worship of Og?n in Yorub?land, as well as the strict adherence to agnatic descent within traditional Yorub? society. Also, the collective relationship between cabildo men and their patron oricha (whether or not they are initiated santeros) resembles Ni gerian oris? traditions, where agnate household members may inherit an association with the household's patrilineal oris?. As such, while this practice differs from mainstream Santer?a, I hypothesize that this cabildo's gender-exclusive trait represents a possible retention of traditional prac tices from precolonial Yorub?land. The cabildo's relative age vis-?-vis the establishment of systematic practices now associated with Santer?a is the key to this interpretation, a theme to which I shall return after a brief overview of the history of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara. The Cabildo Santa B?rbara Like the Matanzas region, the central provinces of Cuba were also home to sugar plantations and related industries, and in the old city of Sancti Spiritus a nineteenth-century Iyes? cabildo called Cabildo Santa B?rbara was established after previously existing in nearby areas. The year of the cabildo's founding is uncertain. Interviewed in the 1980s by Cuban research ers, cabildo elders (then ninety-nine and eighty-seven years old) asserted that the Cabildo Santa B?rbara had been established well before the Ten Years War, which began in 1868 (Brizuela Quintanilla 1988, 28).12 Before this, they insisted, the cabildo had existed in the nearby area of Mapos, near the southern coast, where the original "African" founders worked as slaves for the Valle family. From Mapos, its founders relocated the cabildo to the nearby town of Guasimal before settling in Sancti Spiritus. The first written documentation of the cabildo does not appear until 1894, when a local publication called El Pa?s mentions a December 4 celebration (the feast day of Santa B?rbara). The cabildo obtained legal recognition only in 1953 under the name Sociedad Luz Divina de Santa B?rbara (Divine Light of Saint Barbara Society), though today it is commonly referred to as the Cabildo Santa B?rbara (26,29,32). The founders of the Sancti Spiritus cabildo were African-born slaves known as Octavio Carrillo (Taita Vale), a babalao, and Ma Salom? Valle, an oricha initiate. Married, they apparently founded the cabildo and com 12. Nearly all of the historical information concerning the Cabildo Santa B?rbara in Sancti Spiritus comes from the work of Cuban scholar Analeese Brizuela Quintanilla. I am grate ful to Olavo Alen Rodr?guez and the staff of CIDMUC for allowing me to review a copy of Brizuela's original 1988 thesis on the cabildo, which formed the basis of the Sancti Spiritus information included in her 1997 article on the Iyes?.</page><page sequence="11">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 11 missioned an unknown person to construct the cabildo's drums. Emerging from the plantation labor of the Valle estates (practically all the elders from the Cabildo Santa B?rbara have Valle as one of their surnames), it is unclear whether one or both of them were still slaves at the time the cabildo was created, though they were probably free by the time the cabildo began re locating to different towns. Carrillo died in 1899, and Ma Salom? Valle led the cabildo until her death in 1930 at over 110 years of age (1988, 29-30). A Cuban-born ex-slave named Mar?a Sixta (Mar?a de la Cruz Valle) took over cabildo authority until her death in 1973 at the age of 118, an event that reportedly weakened the cabildo considerably (33). As of this writing, Olga Guti?rrez Valle is the ranking family member who still lives in the cabildo. The Cabildo Santa B?rbara typically sponsors up to four tambor events annually, with the two major celebrations taking place on December 4 and December 17, the feast days for Santa B?rbara and San L?zaro, respectively. In Cuba, Saint Barbara, a legendary medieval virgin princess, is associated with the oricha Chang? (S?ngo in Nigeria), a deified historical king of the precolonial Oy? kingdom and a powerful oricha of thunder, lightening, fire, and male virility.13 Saint Lazarus is associated with the powerful oricha known as Babaluay?, whose domain is sickness and disease. The Cabildo Santa B?rbara also honors two female oricha with tambor events: Och?n (described above) and Oy?, a female warrior oricha associated with wind, violent storms, death, and ownership of cemeteries (and associated with Santa Teresa). Unlike the Matanzas cabildo, the drums of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara are never played outside of the cabildo. Many people attend the Santa B?rbara celebration held by the cabildo, with a majority of attendees at any given time coming from the local Santer?a community rather than individuals strictly associated with the cabildo.14 As with the Cabildo San Juan Bautista in Matanzas, the Cabildo Santa B?rbara honors its Egun with private rituals in the cabildo's backyard during the 13. This pairing of Saint Barbara and Chang? warrants comment. While Chang? is a power ful and masculine oricha, Saint Barbara was a legendary virgin princess who became Christian against her father's wishes. Enraged by her conversion and refusal to disavow Christian ity, Barbara's father attempted to kill her with his sword but was struck by lightning and killed, an event interpreted as divine action (in some versions, he is struck dead just after decapitating her; other accounts have the martyr princess condemned to death after being beaten by her father). Barbara's association with lightning became the source of her patron age by those in danger of sudden and explosive death, primarily miners and artillerymen. Thus, despite being exact opposites physically, the component of lightning and explosive power united both Santa B?rbara and Chang? in the minds of colonial Afro-Cubans, an as sociation that required knowledge of both personages. 14.

As the hour approaches, a large crowd gathers in the street, and at midnight cabildo members and santeros from the local community begin by singing prayers to Chang? in front of Saint Barbara's statue. Rather than hold a procession, a large number of people crowd together into the room where the statue is situated atop an altar while the cabildo's musicians sit in an adjacent room. While singing an initial prayer to Chang?, the drummers in the adjacent room begin to play a sustained tremolo roll. As the prayers become more strongly metered, the drummers begin to play an accompanying pulse before segueing into their ensemble rhythm. The congregation, led by the gu?a (literally "guide," the song leader), then makes its way into the main room for the tambor proper.15 Unlike the Matanzas cabildo, the oricha festivities continue on and off for a full twenty-four hour period, with people coming and going, concluding on the night of December 4. Discussion In their general organization and rituals, both Iyes? cabildos are much like any typical casa-templo. Each house honors a primary oricha and is also dedicated to that oricha's corresponding Catholic saint. The sacred attributes for each oricha, as well as special objects used to venerate ancestors, are "fed" sacrificial offerings before major annual festivities in private rituals. The public tambor celebrations used to honor the oricha in the Iyes? cabildos are nearly identical to the corresponding rituals in mainstream Santer?a. Neigh boring santeros who are not cabildo members attend the annual tambores held by the cabildos, particularly if they have a spiritual relationship with the patron oricha of the particular cabildo. At the same time, however, their respective santero communities view each cabildo as being archaic and anachronistic, their traditions peculiarly lacking. By far the major difference between the Iyes? cabildos and main stream Santer?a practices is that both Iyes? cabildos are part of the sur rounding Santer?a /Ocha culture but never initiate anyone into the religion. That is, despite the fact that vessels containing the consecrated objects of the patron oricha are maintained in each cabildo, these oricha vessels have never been used to either "birth" new oricha for new Santer?a initiates or to "seat" the partial essence of an oricha in the head of a new initiate (both are common practices within the Santer?a/Ocha religion). According to the oral histories in both Iyes? cabildos, no one has ever "made ocha" in the 15. Senior cabildo drummer "Nene" (Raimundo Valle Pina, b.1932) provided me with the term gu?a, a common term also used in secular music contexts (Valle Pina 2006).</page><page sequence="13">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 13 cabildos. If someone affiliated with either cabildo desires to make ocha, they must go to a mainstream Lucumi/Santeria house to do so (which some cabildo members have done), even if the oricha to be initiated is the patron oricha of a particular Iyes? cabildo. In neither Iyes? cabildo did I encounter anyone who could explain why their respective cabildos did not perform mainstream initiations. Interest ingly, Cabildo Santa B?rbara members Olga Guti?rrez Valle and Mar?a Josefa Guzm?n stated that although they did not "have santo," those associated with the cabildo undergo what they described as a type of "baptism" to become a member of the house/cabildo, "marking" and "presenting" the head of the initiate to the oricha of the cabildo (by oricha, they are referring to the consecrated oricha vessels, which contain sacred objects that are charged with the oricha's power). Guzman clarified that this was a "baptism" to the house and its oricha, not "making santo" in the sense of an initiation into mainstream Santer?a (Guzm?n 2006). When I asked whether this house baptism lessened the motivation to become fully initiated into the Santer?a/ Ocha religion, both agreed that cabildo affiliates felt less need to "make santo" elsewhere "unless there was some problem" that might motivate an individual to seek full initiation (Guzman 2006; Guti?rrez Valle 2006). The Cabildo Santa B?rbara, then, does possess initiation rituals, but ca bildo-specific ones. Upon their "baptism," cabildo members do not receive what their counterparts in mainstream Santer?a receive: vessels and objects of a standard ensemble of several oricha in addition to their primary oricha, which enable the practitioner to later initiate members to a variety of oricha, not simply his or her own patron oricha. While this simultaneous reception of an ensemble of oricha vessels is standard procedure in Cuban Santer?a, it is not part of the oris? practices in Yorub?land. The ritually sanctioned closeness cabildo members feel when "baptized" into the cabildo and its oricha lies outside Santer?a /Ocha norms, though it somewhat resembles in function the relationship male members of the Matanzas cabildo have with Og?n without possessing santero status, as well as more localized Nigerian oris? practices (where initiation to a locally known oris? has a localized sphere of influence). In Matanzas, though cabildo members were certain that no one had ever "made ocha" in their cabildo, individuals I interviewed generally could not explain why this was so. Cabildo president Ernesto Knight speculated that an explanation might be related to the group of babaiao that had founded the cabildo. As specialized priests of the oricha Orula and the If? divination system, babalaos do not "make ocha" in the conventional sense and are not "mounted" or "possessed" by Orula/If?, their patron oricha. Knight surmised that this could explain why no initiatory tradition of possession oricha existed within the cabildo (Knight Garcia 2000b).</page><page sequence="14">14 BMR JOURNAL In a sense, I believe Knight's reasoning suggests an explanation as to why both cabildos do not perform standard Santer?a initiation rituals. While it is tempting to declare the lack of Santer?a initiations in both cabildos repre sents a unity of Iyes? practices or retentions, I would argue in this case that their unity is not so much the cabildos' Iyes?-ness but rather their antiq uity. I contend that the noninitiatory traditions of these cabildos represent elements of nineteenth-century oricha cabildo practices, perhaps formerly widespread ones. Recalling the early to mid-nineteenth-century periods of the cabildos' founding and the early twentieth-century standardization of Santer?a practices, I propose interpreting the distinct practices of the Iyes? cabildos (vis-?-vis mainstream Santer?a) as signs of antiquity, ones that likely predate the aforementioned standardization of Santer?a rituals. In short, I theorize that the reason members of these Iyes? cabildos do not "make santo" is because their oricha practices may be older than the wide spread establishment and systematization of the initiatory rituals within Cuban Santer?a, a theory bolstered by the gender-exclusive membership of the Matanzas cabildo as well as the localized initiation rituals within the Cabildo Santa B?rbara. Viewing cabildo traditions through the lens of antiquity, then, has the effect of inverting the prevailing theme regarding cultural erosion and loss vis-?-vis Santer?a practices, suggesting that the Iyes? cabildos' "lack" of "proper" Santer?a initiations represents not the loss of rituals but rather the resistance to adopting ones created and stan dardized after the cabildos had been founded. The issue of antiquity that unifies my presentation of Iyes? cabildo history does not extend as easily to musical practices, where, as we shall later see, one cabildo dominates the representation of Iyes? music. Iyes? Cabildo Music and Musical Instruments The music and instruments of each Iyes? cabildo share basic traits with not only other Santer?a ensembles but also other Afro-Cuban sacred tradi tions: responsorial song form; the use of African lexicons for sung liturgy; ensembles consisting of drum families of similar shape and differing sizes; hierarchically pitched and hierarchically organized drum ensembles that perform polyrhythmic and polymetric patterns; and accompanying instru ments that perform ostinato timeline patterns. For its tambor rituals, each Iyes? cabildo uses unique drums considered sacred by virtue of the power ful, secret objects contained within the drums, which are played exclusively by men. Called fundamento in Spanish (literally "foundation" or "basis") or, in the case of the Matanzas cabildo drums, by the Lucumi term A?a (the oricha of drumming), these objects identify the drums as containing essen</page><page sequence="15">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 15 rial, consecrated, living objects instilled with spiritual energy.16 Each Iyes? cabildo plays distinct, unique rhythms on its drums, though the general content and aesthetics of these rhythms fall within the stylistic parameters shared by other sacred Afro-Cuban drum traditions. While the focus of each tambor ceremony is a single oricha (as is the case in mainstream Santer?a), songs are typically offered to all oricha, though in the case of each Iyes? cabildo, approximately twelve to fourteen major oricha are honored (fewer than those honored in mainstream Santer?a celebrations). Also, while the sung liturgy used in each cabildo overlaps with that of the mainstream Santer?a community (that is, songs used in each cabildo can be found in the surrounding Santer?a community, and vice versa), each cabildo also pos sesses a collection of prayers and songs not heard elsewhere in the Santer?a world. As we shall see, the rhythms and drums of each Iyes? cabildo seem to indicate that they do not share a single, unified musical tradition. Matanzas Iyes? Drums and Rhythms The Matanzas Iyes? ensemble consists of a set of four double-headed, cylin drical drums of differing sizes and two iron bells. According to cabildo history, the ensemble was originally a three-drum battery in Africa; when drums were constructed for the newly created cabildo, a fourth drum was added (Mar tinez Fur? 1965,107; Le?n 1981). The drums are cedar, the drumheads made from male goat hide fastened to the two openings of the cylindrical drum shell and tightened toward the center of the drum in a bi-tensorial cordage system of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal loops, knots, and braces. While rope made from hemp (c??amo isle?o) was traditionally used for attaching the drumheads, today factory-manufactured synthetic rope is favored because of its resistance to humidity. The drums are painted green, with a horizontal band of yellow circling the middle of the drum; cabildo members state that these colors honor the oricha Og?n and Och?n, respectively, though Fer nando Ortiz states that he was told that the color of the Iyes? drums?which he described as blue-green rather than green and mentions no stripe?was not in honor of Ogun and Och?n but for If?/Orula (1954,4:37o).17 Unlike the 16. Throughout the oricha religion in Cuba, A?a is a term restricted to the divinity within the sacred double-headed bata drums. While other select drums may be considered sacred and therefore fundamento, the vast majority of santeros and drummers contend that only the bata drums contain a special fundamento object pertaining to the drum oricha A?a. Key members in the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista claim that their Iyes? drums contain A?a, a subject I explore elsewhere (Delgado n.d). No such claim exists regarding the drums of the Iyes? cabildo in Sancti Spiritus. 17. Photos of the Matanzas ensemble taken by Argeliers Le?n on behalf of Ortiz in the early 1950s do not show a prominent stripe, though the photos' quality makes it difficult to state this</page><page sequence="16">16 BMR JOURNAL bata drum tradition (double-headed, hourglass-shaped drums considered the most prestigious in Santer?a), which requires a formal, ritual initiation into a fraternity of bata drummers before one is allowed to play the sacred drums, the cabildo has no ceremonial ritual to initiate a cabildo member into a druinming fraternity (though, interestingly, most of the musicians in the Iyes? cabildo are also mainstream Santeria/Ocha initiates). The Iyes? drums of the Matanzas cabildo are normally referred to using Spanish rather than African terms, highest-pitched to lowest: primero or el uno (first or one), segundo or el dos (second or two), caja (lead drum), and bajo (bass drum). The dimensions of the drums range from 250mm in diameter and 280mm in depth for the primero to 280mm in diameter and 370mm in depth for the caja (Brizuela 1997,345)18 The drums are accompanied by two heavy iron bells of different sizes selected from among Ogun's sacred iron accoutrements kept in his altar. Cabildo musicians refer to the bells using both African terms (agogo) and Spanish ones (campana, cencerro), identify ing the higher-pitched bell as primero or uno and the lower-pitched bell as segundo or dos. The drums of the Matanzas cabildo are played while seated, held in two dif ferent manners, and played with varying techniques. The cajero (lead drum mer) holds his drum upright between his thighs so that a single drumhead is roughly parallel to the top of his legs. The caja is played by striking it with a single stick and a bare hand; the bare hand is also used to mute the drumhead so that the stick strokes can be played either "open" or "closed," as well as to play light touches that serve mostly as strokes that enhance timekeeping or "feel." Based on cues from the sung Hturgy, the caja signals for the ensemble to begin and end, and is the principal drum allowed to improvise rhythms within established stylistic frameworks. The two higher-pitched drums play repetitive supporting parts. Both are held sideways atop the left thigh of their drummers, with the left arm draped over the top of the drum to secure its position. The drummers strike a single drumhead with a stick, producing only open tones. The primero drum plays its repetitive pattern without varia tion, while the segundo drum may sparingly play minor variations. Like the caja, the deep-pitched bajo is held between the player's thighs in an upright with certainty. As Ortiz notes that the most common colors of the beaded necklaces and brace lets worn by babalao and other If? devotees are green and yellow, one imagines Ortiz would have mentioned this correspondence had he viewed drums with a yellow stripe. Recalling the key role of babalao in the cabildo's creation, it is possible that If?/Orula was of greater impor tance to the cabildo in its past. 18.1 occasionally heard the caja and bajo referred to as mayor (major/main drum) and reba jador (low/bass drum). Terminology does not appear to be consistent over time, as earlier work by Mart?nez Fur? referred to the highest-pitched drum as the tercero (third) rather than primero (1965,107).</page><page sequence="17">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 17 position. Unlike the caja or other drums, it is played with two bare hands, producing a combination of open and closed (tapado) tones, as well as light touch-strokes that serve to maintain time and feel. The bajo plays a basic pattern, but its player is expected to tastefully and energetically embellish the pattern, sometimes in response to rhythms played by the caja. For all cabildo rhythms, the two iron bells play timeline patterns. A single player holds each bell while standing, striking it with a stick in two different places: near the mouth of the bell (producing an "open" tone with a strong fundamental), and toward the center of the bell, lengthwise (producing a higher, "choked" tone, with increased part?ais and a reduced fundamental). The higher-pitched bell tends to be played with no variation (and sometimes using a single open tone), while the lower-pitched bell may be played with several melodic and rhythmic embellishments. The cabildo uses three distinct rhythms for its liturgical music: two pri mary rhythms to honor the oricha during a tambor, and a single rhythm used only to close a tambor ceremony. One primary oricha rhythm in 6/8 or 12/8 meter is referred to as "Og?n's rhythm" and uses the three highest pitched drums in the ensemble (see Ex. 1, 2); the player of the bajo drum sits with the ensemble, holding the drum without playing it. This rhythm is performed at a slow tempo when saluting several oricha, but when used to salute Og?n the rhythm is played at a fast tempo, approximately twice as fast as the slower rendition. This energetic treatment reserved for Og?n's music is thought to reflect Og?n's power, and the strong metallic sound of the ensemble's bells effectively evokes Og?n's association with iron. The doubling between the two bells and two supporting drums is an unusual part setting in Afro-Cuban sacred music. It is not known whether this bell/ drum relationship is a traditional retention or Cuban innovation. The second primary rhythm used to salute oricha?known as Och?n's rhythm to cabildo drummers?is played in 2/2 or 4/4 meter at a medium to medium-fast tempo (see Ex. 3). Significantly, it is the only rhythm that utilizes all four drums, adding the bajo drum to the ensemble, which sounds below the register of the caja (the caja retains its lead role even though it is not the deepest-pitched drum in this rhythm). Ortiz reported that only Example 1. Notation key for all music examples.

The closing or despedida (farewell) rhythm is the cabildo's least well known rhythm, played only at the end of a tambor ceremony as a bucket of water is carried from the main room of the tambor to be emptied into the street, thus "refreshing" the room and carrying away any residual negative spiritual energy (this is a standard ritual element at the conclusion of a Santer?a/Ocha tambor). The despedida rhythm is in duple meter, played at a medium-slow tempo on the same three drums used in Og?n's rhythm (see Ex. 4). Again, note the doubling of patterns between the bells and support drums. When concluding a tambor in Og?n's honor on the June 24 El d?a de San Juan celebrations, the closing rhythm may be further embellished through the special use of supplemental iron bells. These additional bells, kept among Og?n's sacred accoutrements and housed within Og?n's altar, are played by the cabildo's acting president, who reaches inside the cabinet housing</page><page sequence="19">Delgado Iyes?

Like other Afro-Cuban sacred ensembles, the percussion instruments of the Matanzas Iyes? ensemble support a sung liturgy used in a tambor ceremony, and the cajero (lead drummer) generally follows the lead of the agon (song leader).19 Iyes? song-prayers typically consist of one or two brief phrases in call-and-response form. Of the approximately fifty to sixty songs used in the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo, roughly one third of them are also found in the mainstream Santer?a liturgy in both Havana and Matanzas. Despite Og?n's "ownership" of the cabildo, Och?n's songs are the most numerous, comprising approximately one fourth of the cabildo's repertoire. 19.

Drums and Rhythms The current instruments of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara combine traditional and popular music drums with a single timeline instrument. There exist four traditional "African" style drums of varying sizes, though only two to three of these are still played today. Cuban scholar Analeese Brizuela Quintanilla's research (1988) indicates that this was also originally a three drum tradition, though the age of a fourth traditional drum (which is not played) is uncertain. Each traditional drum is cylindrical, double-headed, and unpainted, with drumheads made of male goat hide that are laced with hemp rope toward the center of the drum with a cordage system similar to that of the Matanzas Iyes? drums. Each drum is typically played in a seated position. As in the Matanzas cabildo, the two smallest and highest-pitched drums, here called coc? primero and coc? segundo, play supporting parts with slight variations. Each drum sits sideways upon the player's left thigh with the drumheads perpendicular to the floor and one drumhead facing</page><page sequence="21">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 21 forward. Both drums are played with two thick sticks in a variant of what is typically called "traditional grip" in snare drum parlance, with the left hand hanging over the top of the drum and holding the stick between the thumb, index, and middle fingers while the right hand uses an overhand grip (see Fig. 2). The lead drum or caja is the largest and deepest-pitched drum and is played by laying the drum sideways atop a wooden bench in the corner of the main cabildo room. The bench is used because of the drum's height, which at 520mm (329mm diameter) is far larger than any of the Matanzas Iyes? drums. The cajero sits or sometimes stands turned toward the drum with the primary drumhead perpendicular to both the floor and the cajero, and uses two sticks held in matched (overhand) grip (see Fig. 2). The right hand mostly plays open and closed tones on the drumhead, while the left hand either strikes the drum's wooden shell or reaches over to play a variety of tones and touches on the dnimhead. While the battery of drums is considered to be sacred, in fact it is only the caja that contains the powerful fundamento object. The final drum of the traditional set, sized in between the smaller coc? drums and the larger caja, is kept on a wall and not played. At some point during the 1940s, the instrumentation of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara changed. According to oral histories collected by Brizuela, two folk/ Figure 2. Performance positions of the coc? drum (left) and caja drum (right) in the Cabildo Santa B?rbara of Sancti Spiritus (illustration by Melodie Tune).</page><page sequence="22">22 BMR JOURNAL popular music drums came into the cabildo ensemble during the 1940s. One, a short, single-headed, tronconical-shaped drum called llamador or requinto, at times substitutes for the coc? segundo; it is held upright between the legs and played with bare hands.20 The second popular music drum is a standard tumbadora (conga drum), now a permanent fixture of the ensemble. It is played with bare hands and functions as a second lead drum, with a complicated and impromptu sharing of improvisatory musical space with the caja. While Brizuela speculates that a generational shift in cabildo personnel had some effect on the cabildo's decision to change instrumentation, she also quotes a cabildo elder who spoke of the desire to "enrich the sonority of the cabildo, to make the music more grandiose" by adding the new drums (90). The drums are accompanied by a single timeline instrument, an iron plow implement called hierro or reja de arado, which consists of a narrow, flat bar with sides that flare out and curl inward towards each other. A standing player holds the flat side of the hierro in one hand while striking the curved section with an iron spike or rod, or a thick wooden stick. The Cabildo Santa B?rbara uses two rhythms for its liturgy. The primary rhythm, used for the majority of music, is in 6/8 or 12/8 meter and uses a common 6/8 timeline pattern. Both the caja and tumbadora are played with a high degree of variation and are rarely heard as presented in the basic part transcription below (see Ex. 5). Because of the two-stick traditional grip technique used on the coc? drums, players are able to produce rapid triplet-figure variations, rhythmic cells that are not found in the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo (see Ex. 6). A second pattern, in 2/2 or 4/4, is described as a rumba or rumbita, a term describing not the Cuban rumba genre but rather, in a sacred music context, designating a general rhythm used for many oricha (see Ex. 7). In Santer?a/Ocha usage, the term rumba also often implies a utilitarian rhythm of somewhat invented pedigree rather than a strictly preserved African cognate rhythm, a rhythm possibly created to accommodate existing or encountered songs. A great majority of songs used in the Cabildo Santa B?rbara are found in the surrounding Santer?a comrnunity repertoire, though the cabildo does preserve rezos (sung prayers) and a few songs that, to my knowledge, are not found outside the cabildo. As songs in the Santer?a/Ocha tradition are typically only offered to one oricha at a time in a lengthy medley, the Cabildo Santa Barbara's unique rezos and songs tend to be used at the beginning of a song cycle for a given oricha. 20. During a cabildo tambor on December 4,2006,1 also observed players holding and strik ing the coc? segundo drum barehanded in the manner that the llamador was played; they had apparently been trained using the llamador and applied that technique to the coc? segundo.</page><page sequence="23">Delgado Iyes?

In comparing the two primary 2/2 or common-time patterns of the Iyes? cabildos, dissimilarities are apparent. The Matanzas Och?n rhythm possesses a more clearly delineated rhythmic hierarchy and part structure, while the slower "rumbita" rhythm of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara contains more repetition and less part independence (see Ex. 3, 7). The 6/8 rhythm used in each cabildo bears a general resem blance to other Santer?a/Ocha drum music played by bemb? ensembles; in the case of the Cabildo Santa Barbara's main rhythm, the correspondence is very close.21 21. Some Cuban scholars have speculated that many Cuban bemb?-drum traditions may have a Iyes? origin (Saenz Coopat 1997). This assertion is intriguing in light of the clear simi larities between the 6/8 drum pattern of Cabildo Santa B?rbara and Cuban bemb? examples, and though not notated here, the caja drum variations used in the Cabildo Santa B?rbara are also very similar to many typical Lucumi bemb? caja drum variations. These similarities sug gest a possible connection between select Cuban bemb? and Cabildo Santa Barbara's tradi tions, though contemporary stylistic comparisons must be tempered with the understanding that changes and influences may have crept into repertoires over many decades.</page><page sequence="25">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 25 In terms of instruments and their performance, both cabildos maintain a battery of four drums, though comparing the traditional drums of the two cabildos reveals differences in terms of dimensions and decoration. Moreover, the drum techniques of the two cabildos also do not correspond, with three of the Sancti Spiritus drums using two drumsticks, two of them in traditional grip (enabling certain triplet-figure variations), while only single sticks or hands are used in the Matanzas cabildo. In terms of sung liturgy, the rezos and songs of the two cabildos have very little in common. Though each cabildo preserves liturgy not shared by surrounding Santer?a/Ocha communities, these liturgies are unique to each respective house and demonstrate no overlap between the two Iyes? cabil dos. Even in liturgy that is shared with surrounding religious communities, the shared repertoires of the two cabildos still contain virtually nothing in common with each other despite the more conventional and widely known nature of these songs. Of the two cabildos, the Cabildo San Juan Bautista in Matanzas has far more songs unique to its repertoire (a majority, in fact), whereas the great majority of the Cabildo Santa Barbara's repertoire is shared with the surrounding mainstream Santer?a community. We have, then, two Iyes? cabildos that share certain general commonali ties but whose specific instruments and repertoire show very little in com mon. Moreover, the two cabildos honor different oricha, a point, as we shall see below, that many santeros find irreconcilable. How can we explain the dissimilar repertoire and differing patron oricha in colonial-era cabildos that claim a common ethnic origin? Addressing this question is made all the more difficult by an additional factor: the total dominance of Matanzas Iyes? expressions over Sancti Spiritus ones in terms of dissemination and perceived authenticity. In the final section of this paper, I identify causes for this representational dominance before exploring possible explanations that might provide a conceptual framework for unifying these seemingly unrelated Iyes? traditions. Iyes? Complexes: Mediating Conflicting Traditions "Iyes? music" is widely understood by santeros, the Cuban folklore industry, and even most scholars to be the liturgy and drums of the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista. The Matanzas cabildo thoroughly dominates representation of Iyes? expressions for a variety of reasons. First, santeros in Matanzas and Havana are generally unaware of the existence of a second Iyes? cabildo. As sources of religious lineages and centers of Santer?a/Ocha culture, Havana and Matanzas constitute the homeland of the Cuban oricha religion throughout Cuba and beyond, so that local Havana and Matanzas attitudes toward Iyes? culture take on the sense of established conventional</page><page sequence="26">26 BMR JOURNAL wisdom and are disseminated throughout the religion's diaspora. Second, the earliest scholarship on Iyes? music in the influential work of Ortiz (1954), Martinez Fur? (1965,1979), and Le?n (1981) does not mention a Sancti Spiri tus cabildo. It was not until Cuban researchers, primarily from the Centro de Investigaci?n y Desarrollo de la M?sica Cubana, undertook comprehensive studies of regions across the island in the 1980s that the Sancti Spiritus ca bildo received scholarly study, most of it unpublished. Third, when mainstream Santer?a houses use songs considered to be Iyes? in origin for their tambor ceremonies, juegos (sets) of non-Iyes? Lucum? in struments (typically the bata drums, but also bemb? and g?iro ensembles) perform a rhythm typically referred to as rumba y esa or toque y esa, a rhythm that clearly imitates the 2/2 Ochun rhythm of the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo. This rhythm has been an established component of the mainstream Santer?a repertoire for an unknown amount of time, though the great Matanzas master drummer "Cha-Ch?" (Esteban Vega Bacallao, 1925-2007) once told me that this rhythm was already in the Matanzas bata repertoire when he was learning to drum in the late 1930s (Vega Bacallao 2000). If aware at all of its origins, santeros associate the source of this rhythm as Iyes?, and Iyes? culture with Matanzas. Fourth, organological evidence supports a connection between the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista and Havana Iyes? traditions. The previously mentioned Havana Iyes? drums on display in the Museo Nacional de la M?sica are of sirnilar number, dimensions, and coloring scheme (green shells with a yellow horizontal stripe) as the Matanzas cabildo drums. Though not widely known, the existence of the Havana museum drums effectively reinforces the Matanzas traditions as normative. A fifth and important reason for the Matanzas cabildo's dominance is because national folkloric expressions of Iyes? culture are modeled exclu sively on the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista. A central figure in the introduction of Iyes? music to the national folkloric repertoire was Cuban ethnologist Rogelio Mart?nez Fur?, who was a founding member of the in fluential Conjunto Folkl?rico Nacional de Cuba (CFNC?National Folkloric Ensemble of Cuba), and served as a director, performer, and consultant to the troupe. In addition to his 1960s research, Mart?nez Fur? commissioned the construction of two juegos of Iyes? drums modeled after the Matanzas cabildo's drums for use by the CFNC and recruited two of the cabildo's expert musicians to teach Iyes? rhythms and songs to CFNC personnel. Mart?nez Fur?'s efforts resulted in a staged work titled "Yorub? Iyes?," which was included in domestic and international presentations by the CFNC (Mart?nez Fur? 2000). Today, Iyes? music, based exclusively on the Matanzas model, is a standard repertoire piece performed by major Afro Cuban folklore ensembles in Havana and Matanzas.</page><page sequence="27">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 27 A sixth reason for the dominance of the Matanzas Iyes? expressions con cerns media representations, an extension of both folkloric and scholarly foci. In addition to recordings of folkloric ensembles playing Matanzas Iyes? music, there exists a single, commercially available recording of the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista. This recording, which used a live mix of multiple microphones in the cabildo to record the cabildo's perfor mance on location, was made in 1977 as part of an eight-volume Antolog?a de la M?sica Afrocubana, a series of LP records released beginning in 1981. While CIDMUC scholars made similar on-site recordings in the Cabildo Santa B?rbara in the mid-1980s, to date only a single excerpt of these ses sions has been made public as part of a compact disc box set titled Official Retrospective of Cuban Music (1999). These types of recordings sell poorly in Cuba and abroad, but for interested parties (santeros, liturgical specialists, musicians, scholars) the recordings are coveted resources and, as such, reify the impression of the Matanzas dominance of Iyes? tradition. Thus, the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista dominates represen tations of Iyes? culture in religious, folkloric, and scholarly fields to the point that Matanzas expressions seem normative, casting the different traditions in the Cabildo Santa B?rbara as unorthodox, inauthentic, even incorrect. This representational dominance was tellingly illustrated to me by an experience I had in 2007 during a brief visit to Sancti Spiritus, where I interviewed Idolid?a Valle, an experienced santera and akp?n (Santer?a/ Ocha song leader) who serves as gu?a/song leader for the Cabildo Santa B?rbara. A member of one of the most respected Ocha houses in the city, Valle revealed to me that her house had recently purchased a newly con structed set of unconsecrated Iyes? drums. Because she was related by blood to the Cabildo Santa B?rbara personnel, served as gu?a for their tambor rituals, and because her two sons served as ritual drummers for the cabildo, I presumed she was speaking of drums modeled after the tradi tional drums of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara. Instead, the drums, purchased from a Matanzas drummer, had been modeled after those of the Matanzas Iyes? cabildo. When I inquired as to why the house had not had drums constructed based upon the local Iyes? model, she stated that the "true Iyes? drums" were drums "from the land of Og?n." I acknowledged the logic of her point, but also noted that in West Africa, Og?n was an oris? (oricha) known throughout wide areas of Yorub?land, not just in the land of the Iyes? (?j?s?), an observation Valle conceded was probably true (Valle 2007). Though there is no such thing as "Iyes? drums" in Yorub?land, Valle's opinion, while perhaps unexpected coming from someone affili ated with the Sancti Spiritus cabildo, reflects the religious and folkloric conventional wisdom regarding Iyes? culture: it is properly associated with Og?n and Och?n, and represented by the Matanzas cabildo's drums,</page><page sequence="28">28 BMR JOURNAL rhythms, and liturgy. Clearly, the perception of the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista as the true and sole bearer of Iyes? tradition is almost without question. Having studied the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista over several years, I confess to being a great admirer of its traditions. But what I wish to explore here is not so much whether one cabildo is ostensibly more authen tic than the other, or which cabildo deserves to be considered the proper representative of Iyes? culture. Rather, I feel it is far more productive and potentially illuminating from a historical perspective to seek explanations as to why there are two old, extant Iyes? cabildos that possess different traditions from one another. Indeed, I begin with the premise that these cabildos' founders created the cabildos by making informed theological decisions based upon ritual knowledge and spiritual interactions within a framework of particular social circumstances. Seeking answers as to the question of difference between two Iyes? traditions, can the instruments, repertoire, and history of these cabildos (or their West African progenitors) reveal clues that might lead to explanatory hypotheses? Beginning with organological data and oricha patronage, the Cabildo Santa B?rbara appears anomalous vis-?-vis Iyes? culture in Matanzas be cause of what is known about surrounding Iyes? cabildos in western Cuba. While it is established that the Matanzas Iyes? drums resemble drums in Havana's Museo Nacional de la M?sica, we have no organological data from the defunct Regla cabildo, though Regla's proximity to Havana and an anecdote recorded by Fernando Ortiz regarding Iyes? descendants in Regla /Havana hiring Matanzas cabildo drummers suggests a shared tra dition. The Iyes? cabildo in Jovellanos, also in western Cuba, has not been active since the 1960s. However, scholar Israel Moliner viewed the cabildo's drums in the late 1970s and reports that the Jovellanos drums resembled the Matanzas ones, making a plurality of three similar sets (Moliner Casta?eda 2000). While similar drum color schemes cannot be taken as proof that these cabildos were all dedicated to the same oricha, such a pattern is strongly implied. Such plural regional linkage and consistency makes the traditions of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara of Sancti Spiritus, with its different patron oricha and unpainted drums of different dimensions (with both larger and smaller drums than the Matanzas cabildo), appear anomalous. However, research in the 1980s conducted by CIDMUC on the extinct Iyes? cabildo in the central Cuban city of Trinidad (which I was able to view in the CIDMUC archive) reveals that the Cabildo Santa B?rbara is not an isolated case. The Trinidad cabildo, named the Cabildo Iyes? Santa B?rbara, was also dedicated to Saint Barbara and Chang?. Though researchers found that the Trinidad cabildo had been dormant since at least the early 1970s (and probably longer), they</page><page sequence="29">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 29 viewed and photographed the cabildo's drums, which consisted of three cy lindrical drums painted red and white in honor of Santa B?rbara and Chang?, their stripe pattern vertical rather than horizontal, their dimensions similar to Sancti Spiritus drums. Thus, in terms of oricha/saint patronage, original number and dimensions of drums, and drum decoration, there appear to be two distinct Iyes? traditions in Cuba, each historically with multiple cabildos. Therefore, I propose that we speak of a western and central Cuban Iyes? complex, grouping the cabildo sites together in historical complexes based upon the above criteria (see Fig. 3). This identification of two distinct Iyes? complexes groups the Sancti Spiritus cabildo into a larger, heterogeneous Iyes? tradition rather than viewing it as incorrect vis-?-vis a homogenous, Matanzas-dominated one, with each complex consisting of a multi-cabildo tradition and each with a single extant cabildo. This grouping, in turn, recasts the Matanzas cabildo as perhaps the dominant but not exclusive representa tion of Cuban Iyes? cultural expressions. While the grouping of Trinidad and Sancti Spiritus Iyes? cabildos into a single historical complex somewhat mitigates the issue of the Sancti Spiritus cabildo as an isolated anomaly, its difference vis-?-vis Matanzas remains unexplained. Complexes notwithstanding, for the vast majority of observ ers, the biggest incongruity between the two extant cabildos is the Cabildo Santa Barbara's veneration of Chang? (known by all santeros as the mon arch of the historical kingdom of Oy? /Oy?) rather than Og?n or Och?n, which are characterized as the "true" Iyes? oricha. In proposing a new way of conceptualizing Iyes? culture, I wish to reexamine the historical records of these oricha in Yorub?land for clues that might explain the apparently contradictory Iyes? traditions in Cuba.

This has resulted in basic summaries of oricha origins, some of which come from oral history, and some from Africanist scholarship that, while factu ally correct, over-simplify the historical picture (e.g., Chang? comes from Oy?, Og?n comes from Ire ?kiti, and so forth). The purity of certain Yorub? "retentions" in the Americas is being rethought in light of work revealing either post-slavery transatlantic interchange or reciprocal relationships be tween religious authorities and scholars during the twentieth century.22 The growing body of work on the precolonial history of Yorub?land also dem onstrates that the or?s? past is considerably more complex than previously supposed.23 For example, or?s? such as ?gun and ?run?la (Orula in Cuba) were known throughout Yorub?land, while other or?s? were widely but not universally known, and many more or?s? known only in tightly localized settings. Peel (1997) has described the particular, collective groupings of universally known, widely known, and locally known or?s? worshiped in any given locale as a "local cult complex." Such complexes varied greatly from region to region and were susceptible to reformation as a result of social change (e.g., migration, colonization, or warfare) or, interestingly, personal choice, such as appealing to a new divinity if a particular or?s? in the local cult complex proved ineffective in resolving a problem. Moreover, the an thropomorphic, behavioral, or natural domains associated with or?s? were apparently somewhat flexible, particularly if an or?s? was brought by its devotees to a new territory where the or?s?'s domain was already occupied by a preexisting divinity.24 Finally, contemporary precolonial observations suggest a considerable intermingling of or?s? worship practices at odds with conventional diaspora assumptions regarding rigidly bounded or?s? 22. Palmi? (1995, 2002, 252-253) and Brown (2003) note not only Ortiz's use of Africanist scholarship in constructing the Afro-Cuban past, but demonstrate that influential religious practitioners likely gained historical information on Africa through access to Ortiz's library, information that subsequently worked its way into the religion's oral and written history. See also the summary of Ortiz's close interaction with expert bata drummers by Marcuzzi (2005,381-411). For related discussions in Brazilian Candombl?, see Matory (2005a, 38-148) and Wafer (1991,56-58). 23. See Ajayi and Crowder (1985), Apter (1992), Falola and Childs (2004), Law (1977,1984), Matory (2005a, 2005b), and Peel (1983, 2003). 24. For example, Peel cites Sch?tz (1985), whose work identified areas where the male oris? Sango (Chang?) became represented as female when Sang?'s worship was brought to towns that already had a male thunder deity. Peel also documents numerous descriptions of Og?n represented not as an oris? of iron or war but of snakes (1997, 271-275).</page><page sequence="31">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 31 homelands. In his extensive work with the Anglican Church Missionary Society's archives, Peel (1997, 2003) catalogs numerous mentions of oris? practices in nineteenth-century Yorub?land. While qualifying the limits of the data, Peel's study nonetheless documents instances of oris? worship not only far from an oris?'s mythical homeland, but also directly within the homelands of other oris?, contradicting essentialized notions of oris? containment within their territories of origin. It is important to keep this complexity, flexibility, and locality in mind when returning to the issue of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara and its legitimacy vis-?-vis the Iyes? traditions of Matanzas. For many santeros, practitioner scholars, and scholars alike, the idea that a cabildo of ?j?s? descendants would honor Chang? is inconceivable (if not outright evidence in and of itself of the Cabildo Santa Barbara's inauthenticity) given Chang? /S?ngo's strong identification in Lucumi lore with his historical reign as an early monarch of Oy? and its wide-ranging empire. Historical antagonists of the ?j?s? Kingdom, the Oy? were never able to conquer the ?j?s? despite several attempts. Consequently, S?ngo worship was known over large portions of Yorub?land, but not in ?j?s? territory, where an older sky/thunder oris? known as Oramfe was worshiped. Given these facts, then, how do we explain a Iyes? cabildo in Cuba dedicated to Chang?? It is possible that a decision to venerate Chang? represents a change in Iyes? traditions that took place in Cuba rather than retention from West Africa. Perhaps the Cuban popularity of Chang?/Santa B?rbara led the ?j?s? descendants in Sancti Spiritus and Trinidad to establish Iyes? cabil dos under anew oricha patron, one that the cabildos' founders believed to be more efficacious than their "Iyes?" divinities. Or, as slaves from the Yorub? interior were often moved and /or resold across Yorub? territories prior to being sent to the Americas, the cabildo founders could have picked up S?ngo worship while in captivity in Yorub? lands with a strong S?ngo tradition. Taking into account the shifting complexity of the Yorub? territories in the nineteenth century, I wish to explore an additional explanation based upon a closer reading of Yorub? history, particularly the social changes wrought by the conflicts and migrations engulfing all of Yorub?land in the early nineteenth century. Beginning in the 1790s and lasting through the first thirty-six years of the 1800s, the far flung Oy? Empire began to suffer from a variety of rebellions, military defeats, and internal power struggles, resulting in the collapse of its empire and destruction of its capital (Law 1977). Throughout the decades of upheaval associated with the fall of its empire, Oy? refugees and migrants moved southward to other regions of Yorub?land, including the northernmost territories of the ?j?s?. At the same time, due to both migration patterns and internal politics, the ?j?s?</page><page sequence="32">32 BMR JOURNAL lost control of some of their northernmost towns in the 1820s. For example, ?sogbo, located on the northern side of the ?sun River in what was north ern Ij?s? country, was and is considered the homeland of the river or?s? ?sun (who became Ochun in Cuba). As the Oy? Empire steadily collapsed, ?sogbo became so populated with Oy? refugees and immigrants that it "became effectively an Oyo town" (sic) (Peel 1983,77-78). It is possible that many Oy? brought worship of their thunder oricha S?ngo with them when they arrived in northern Ij?s? lands (or reinforced his previous presence). Moreover, while Ij?s? territory already had a thunder deity in Oramfe, Ij?s? worship of him was restricted to territory south and east of the ?sun river (Peel 2003,110-111), presumably leaving an opening for S?ngo in northern Ij?s? territories, including ?sogbo. As Oy? immigrants established them selves in northern ?j?s?land, it seems plausible that S?ngo worship could have gained greater traction there as well. With these factors in mind, I wish to suggest the possibility that the founders of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara originally came from northern Ij?s? territory after the area became saturated with migrants from Oy? whose presence strengthened worship of their powerful thunder or?s? S?ngo. If this theory is correct, the divergent Iyes? cultures as expressed in the two extant cabildos (and their historical complexes), seemingly inconsis tent, could reflect retention of localized, intra-ethnic diversity and social changes in early and mid-nineteenth-century Ij?s? territories. Put another way, both cabildos could be viewed as bearers of Iyes? tradition, but each representing a different ?j?s? region during a different era and under a different social reality, with the Matanzas cabildo perhaps reflecting more longstanding or numerically superior religious associations. Can the cabildos' musical traditions contribute to this theory? Concern ing the Cabildo Santa B?rbara, Chang?'s close association in Cuba with the bata drums would seem to contradict my Chang? /Iyes? hypothesis, though a few points should be noted. First, in Cuba and Nigeria, other oricha, including Och?n, Ogun, and Elegb?, are associated with the bata (Vincent 2006,63-65). Second, some master drummers argue that the rela tionship of the bata drums to Egun rituals is of greater significance than to that of Chang? (103). Third, the bata are not the only drums that venerate Chang? in Cuba, as select sets of Cuban bemb? drums (and drums of the Cabildo Santa B?rbara) are also dedicated to him (Saenz Coopat 1997; Balbuena Guti?rrez 2003). Despite their differing dimensions, rhythmic repertoires, performance methods, and decorative iconography, the drums of the two Iyes? cabildos do share a common general morphology and cordage system, suggesting a com mon drum tradition as origin. If descended from a single type of ensemble,</page><page sequence="33">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 33 from what do the drums of the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista and the Cabildo Santa B?rbara derive? The most probable cognates for both sets of Iyes? drums are Yorub? b?rhb? drums (different from the generalized and diverse category of Cuban bemb? drums), which are cylindrical, double headed snare drums activated with curved sticks and often accompanied by one or two struck iron bells and shakers/rattles. Working in Yorub?land during the mid-1960s, Darius Thieme reported that b?rhb? music enjoyed the widest popularity in ?j?s? and ?gba territories, played to accompany vo cal music for a variety of secular and sacred occasions. Generally played in ensembles of two to three drums, or five or more, Thieme wrote that in ?j?s? country the ensemble size was typically three (1969,148-149,155). Though they are also found in other parts of Yorub?land and are also used to honor a variety of oris?, b?rhb? drums are used in ?sogbo for ?sun celebrations, and for this reason they are sometimes mistakenly associated in diaspora scholarship with Osun worship or ?j?s? usage exclusively.25 Though neither Cuban ensemble contains snare drums or curved sticks,26 Yorub? b?rhb? drums demonstrate the strongest correspondence to both Cuban Iyes? juegos among the Yorub? drums with which I am familiar.27 The three-drum ?j?s? b?rhb? ensemble as likely origin of Iyes? juegos brings us to an intriguing element of Iyes? ensembles: their apparent blend of in novation with traditional retention. It is unknown why both juegos became four-drum sets even though their respective cabildo oral histories affirm that they were modeled on three-drum African ensembles, but this suggests a rethinking of Iyes? music, or at least one of its most well known expressions. Recall that in the Matanzas cabildo the fourth drum (the bajo) is only used for Ochun's rhythm and plays a prominent role in the rhythm's performance. 25. To refer to b?rhb? drums as Ij?s? drums would be inaccurate. Besides Thieme's men tion of their popularity in ?gba culture, Lawal documents b?mb? drums being performed during dance interludes associated with G?l?d? masking festivals in western Yorub?land, far from both Ij?s? territory and the ?sun river (1996, 89,156). Yorub? historian Samuel Johnson, writing in the late nineteenth century, notes that b?rhb? drums were popular but were "of recent invention" in Yorub?land, introduced by the Hausa-speaking peoples to the north of the Yorub? (1921,121). The reported Hausa origin of these drums further weakens the notion of b?rhb? drums as "Ij?s? drums." 26. Interestingly, CIDMUC researchers photographed curved sticks that were formerly used by the Cabildo Santa B?rbara. The technology to wind gut into drum snares was likely phased out in Cuba or never appeared in the re-created drums of the Iyes? cabildos (I thank Michael Marcuzzi for this suggestion). 27. This is advisedly an incomplete listing of drums used in Ij?s? culture, as Thieme reports additional types (1969, 155). Other drums are also used in worship of ?sun, while Ad?gbit? (1988, 22) reports a type of ?gun drum ensemble called ogid?n. Also found in Ij?s? territory (and beyond) are ?g?r? drums, associated with both ?gun and hunters and which are single membrane, pegged drums with footed bottoms (Thieme 1969, 247-248; Ad?gbit? 1988, 22).</page><page sequence="34">34 BMR JOURNAL If the bajo?Och?n's drum?represents a Cuban modification of an African tradition, does this mean that Och?n's rhythm, the most prominent musi cal representation of Iyes? culture, is an invento (invention), an innovative binarization of a ternary Ij?s? rhythm (P?rez Fern?ndez 1986), or simply an aesthetic expansion of a nineteenth-century Ij?s? rhythm? While detailed musical analysis of the current traditional repertoire in ?j?s?land may sug gest some answers to these questions, it is clear that, in trying to look deeply into the Iyes? past, we have learned more about Iyes?/Ocha history but also revealed the limited extent of our knowledge. Musically, Iyes? drum patterns and songs, particularly in terms of Ma tanzas expressions, reinforce this idea of partial historical knowledge. One tantalizing example is found in field recordings made in Jovellanos in 1957 by Cuban ethnologist Lydia Cabrera and Josefina Tarafa (2001), which include a performance of a bemb? drum ensemble playing what is identified as toque yes?. This rendition, particularly the variations per formed by the caja drum, vaguely resembles neither the nearby Matanzas cabildo's Ogun or Och?n's rhythm but rather its despedida rhythm, a possible indication that the rhythm may have been used in other locales for more than closing rituals and suggesting a musical link between Ma tanzas and Jovellanos. This unexpected appearance of what is thought to be a Matanzas Iyes? closing rhythm in another locale leads to a final point regarding histori cal incompleteness. For all the study of retentions and comparisons, it is almost certain that both Iyes? cabildos hold only a partial record of colo nial Iyes? performative culture (something likely equally true of Lucumi culture). The sung liturgy bears this out as well, as the repertoires of the two extant cabildos demonstrate practically no commonality. Yet there exist many songs within the island's mainstream Santer?a/Ocha tambor repertoire, exclusively in common or cut-time and performed by various ensembles using the rumba yesa rhythm, that are identified by santeros to be of Iyes? origin but that are not found in the repertoires of either extant Iyes? cabildo. From where did these Iyes? songs come? There are at least two possible explanations. I suspect that extinct Iyes? cabildos were the source for many of these songs, particularly the Havana and Regla cabildos about which we know so very little. These songs could have been transferred into the influential Havana and Regla Santer?a rep ertoires while most or all of the Iyes? cabildos were still active, or within a generation after their demise. A second possibility is that some Iyes? songs in question could have also come from Matanzas province long ago and were preserved in Havana and elsewhere but forgotten in Matanzas. Also, some "Iyes?" songs were likely added to the repertoire based on</page><page sequence="35">Delgado Iyes? Complexes 35 their musical fit to the rumba yesa rhythm, not their Iyes? or even Lucumi origins.28 The existence of music (songs, specifically) widely identified as of Iyes? origin but not found in either extant Iyes? cabildo demonstrates the prob ability that the two cabildos are partial bearers of what was likely a much larger Iyes? repertoire and, by extension, precolonial-era ?j?s? music. This idea, that the two cabildos represent parts of a diverse tradition, provides an additional way to mediate some of the differences between them. When combined with the challenges of preserving oral tradition in diaspora and the proposal that aesthetic innovations (e.g., rhythms, iconography, adding drums) may have been purposefully undertaken by nineteenth-century Cubans of ?j?s? descent, these hypotheses provide explanatory frameworks for understanding differing Cuban traditions that claim Iyes? heritage. Conclusion In this essay I have examined a single ethnic element of Black Atlantic reli gious culture through a critical historiography of its musical and religious traditions vis-?-vis mainstream Santer?a/Ocha. I have provided a summary of Cuban Iyes? history and drum traditions, and presented hypotheses as to why the considerable age of both cabildos may explain their differences from mainstream Santer?a/Ocha traditions. I have identified a rationale for the dominance of Iyes? expressions by the Cabildo Iyes? Moddu San Juan Bautista in Matanzas, but I have also proposed grouping historical Iyes? cabildos into complexes that demonstrate a plurality for each extant Iyes? tradition. Noting the difference in drums, rhythms, repertoire, and, importantly, patron oricha, I have argued that each cabildo likely is a bearer of partial historical Iyes? traditions, and I have presented hypotheses that might account for what ostensibly have been regarded as incompatible Iyes? traditions. Working from the premise that ?j?s? descendants found ed Iyes? cabildos in a deliberate fashion in the nineteenth century, I have sought not to diminish the standing of dominant Matanzas traditions but to search for explanations that might explain and legitimize the traditions of both cabildos under a broader historical Iyes? rubric. The triangulation 28. Respected Havana akp?n and researcher L?zaro Pedroso informed me that certain "Iyes?" songs were introduced into the Havana Santer?a repertoire well after he had be gun singing in tambores in the early 1950s, and that some songs performed with the rumba yesa rhythm are not of Iyes? or even Lucumi origin. Moreover, Pedroso also asserts that he introduced a Iyes? song for the oricha Ochosi into the Havana Santer?a repertoire af ter studying the previously-mentioned 1977 field recording of the Matanzas cabildo, a re minder of the malleability of tradition in the recording age (Pedroso 2001).</page><page sequence="36">36 BMR JOURNAL of past and present Iyes? music and rituals with possible Nigerian sources and cognates proposes new historical connections (and discontinuities), challenging long-held beliefs regarding Iyes? music and rituals, as well as select assumptions regarding the primacy of mainstream Lucumi culture. This examination of a single, ostensibly marginal ethnic thread within the tapestry of the Santer?a/Regla de Ocha religion suggests potentially reward ing avenues of inquiry with which to reconsider the religion's colonial-era past, perhaps leading us to reconsider the performative components of the religion's dynamic and ever-changing present.
