The present collection of essays edited by Johannes Hahn is the product of an interdisciplinary colloquium with the same title held at Miinster on 17 18 November 2000. The volume comprises eleven studies concerning ancient reactions to and reflections on the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 587 BCE and 70 CE, mainly from the perspectives of the Old Testament and the religious politics in the ancient Near East, Judaism and early Christianity in their respective Graeco-Roman contexts. Walter Mayer introduces the reader to the religious and political con</page><page sequence="2">82 REVIEW OF BOOKS texts of the destruction of sanctuaries in the ancient Near East, among which he categorises the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 587 BCE (1-22). Mayer's survey of examples, from Sumer (3rd / 2nd millennium BCE) up to Babylon (between 486-465), is interesting in that it throws light on the destruc don of the First Temple from sources outside the Old Testament. Mayer shows that the destruction of a sanctuary fitted in with the Mesopotamian religious politics, of subjecting a conquered people. The ultimate means of subjection were the destruction of a sanctuary, when it functioned as an ideological cen tre of resistance, and the deportation of the people. Mayer explains the destruc tion of the First Temple as the Babylonian punishment for the breach of a treaty concerning the payment of tribute by Judah to Babylon; a treaty which was at the same time the symbol of subjection of the Judaic deity to the Babylonian deity Marduk (19, 21). Mayer's survey of Mesopotamian religious politics is convincing in that it traces both continuities, such as the punishment of people and deity in the case of the breach in a treaty, and changes, such as the change from wars of conquest to wars of destruction during the sev enth century. In the second article, on the religious and political significance of the destruction of the First Temple (pp. 23-39), Rainer Albertz tries to retrieve information from the Old Testament about the imperial politics of Babylon towards towards Judah. Albertz's hypothesis explains the destruction of the First Temple as the exceptional Babylonian punishment for the anti-Babylonian revolt by a Judaic national-religious party, which had the Temple as it organisational and ideological basis and counted on Egyptian military support (32-38). Albertz points to interesting indications from the Psalter, Jeremiah, and 2 Kings for the central place of the Jerusalem Temple in an anti-Babylonian uprising in the years before 587 BCE. However, Albertz's idea that the scribes who first transmitted the book of Jeremiah were as a rule pro-Babylonian (32) appears less likely, since the prophecies of future judgement against Babylon in MT Jer 25:12-14 and MT Jer 50-51 (cf. LXX Jer 27-28) do not provide a pro Babylonian picture. The book of Jeremiah could be called 'pro-Babylonian' to the extent that it consistently describes the king of Babylon as the servant of the Lord and as an agent of destruction, whose punishment of Judah would ultimately turn against Babylon itself. The third article, by Karl-Friedrich Pohlmann, focuses on Jewish reactions to and theological reflections on the destruction of the First Temple as they may be derived from 1-2 Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Psalter (40-60). Pohlmann's thesis is that there were no pre-existing theological referential frameworks which could help to deal with and overcome the religious crisis caused by the destruction of the First Temple (41). He therefore interprets the representation of the kavod in Ezek 8-11, 40-48 and the deuteronomistic Shan theology as distinct reflections on the relation between God and God's dwelling in the Temple in view of the catastrophe of 587 BCE (45-48). Pohlmann also</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF BOOKS 83 identifies traces of the initial loss of religious orientation after 587 BCE in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel (50-57). Even though Pohlmann substantiates his general thesis well, his reference to studies which characterise the First Temple period as a period with an iconic YHWH-cult closely connected to Jerusalem (45-46) misrepresents the recent state of scholarship. Pohlmann quotes an article by Christoph Uehlinger as authority concerning the "growing and indisputable evidence which contradicts the claim that the cult in the south era kingdom of Judah was essentially aniconic" (45-46 n. 27).' However, Pohlmann fails to see that this is Uehlinger's rather provocative conclusion after a survey which aimed to show the remaining uncertainties after a cen tury of archaeology and the lack of "proof of a general and principal Judahite aniconism."2 Moreover, Uel11inger,s conclusion is not shared by all other schol ars, as the article by Tryggve N.D. Mettinger in the same volume shows; Mettinger instead states that "the Yahwistic cult was aniconic from the begin ning" and calls the subject matter of (an/)iconism a "controversial issue."3 Pohlmann's suggestion that the phrases in Ezek 8:12 (= Ezek 9:9) andjer 12:7 about God's abandonment of the Temple and the land (of Israel) stand for the deportation of a cultic image of YHWH from the Temple (55-57) in my view also remains controversial and without substantial argumentation. The fourth article, by Ariane Cordes, Therese Hansberger and Erich Zenger, (61-91) discusses the reception of MT Psalm 74, a lamentation about the destruction of the First Temple, in the Septuagint and in the rabbinic MidrashMidrash Tehillim, the oldest part of which dates back to the Talmudic period. Zenger, Cordes and Hansberger respectively analyse MT Ps 74, LXX Ps 73, and Midrash Tehillim on MT Ps 74. Zenger's analysis (62-72) comprises a care ful survey of text-critical issues (62-64), the structure and sixth-century BCE, exilic origin of the text (64-67), and the reflections in MT Ps 74 on the 'destruc tion' of God's proximity in the community's perspective due to the destruc tion of the Temple by the enemies (67-72). Zenger shows that these reflections constitute a transformation in traditional belief and temple theology. Cordes's discussion of LXX Ps 73 (72-80) succinctly points to the interpretative features of the Septuagintal translation of MT Ps 74, such as key words like ΰπερ ηφανία, 'arrogance,' in LXX Ps 73:3, 23 and εις τέλος in LXX Ps. 73:1, 3, 10, 11, 19. These terms, Cordes convincingly notes, stress the arrogance of God's enemies and their sure punishment in the end rather than the individ ual lamentation about the destruction of the Temple (77-80). Hansberger's contribution (81-89) focuses on the literary representation of the destruction of the Temple in MTeh 74 and observes that the rabbinic writing intensifies the catastrophic experience and puts it in an eschatological perspective. The fifth article, by Hermann Lichtenberger, (92-107) presents a thematic discussion of texts (1-2 Maccabees; Philo; Josephus; 1QS; 11QT; 4 Ezra; Rev) to illustrate developments in Jewish and Christian perspectives on the profanation and eventual destruction of the Second Temple. Lichtenberger's discussion</page><page sequence="4">84 REVIEW OF BOOKS highlights a number of theological explanations for such catastrophes, but un fortunately it is also piecemeal in certain respects. For instance, when he describes Josephus' view in the Jewish War that the end of the Temple cult occurs according to a divine plan which precludes the re-erection of a Temple (100), Lichtenberger leaves the evidence ofjosephus' treatise Against Apion (e.g. AgAp.AgAp. 2.193-198) out of the picture. On the basis of this apologetic treatise as well as a polemical passage in Barnabas 16.1-4, the opposite idea could equally well be argued that Josephus' late first-century writings were not devoid of dormant expectations of re-erection of the Temple. Lichtenberger's paragraph on the idea that the indestructibility of the Temple functioned as an ideological myth among revolutionary circles of zealots mainly deals with evidence from Josephus and Revelation 11:1-2 as a 'zealotic fragment' (102-106). However, a text like 2 Macc 3:38-39 suggests a more general expectation in Jewish religiosity concerning God's protection of the Temple from destruction or profanation. The sixth and seventh articles, written by Folker Siegert and Stefan Lucking respectively, discuss sayings of Jesus in the New Testament which con cern the Temple. The former article (108-139) interprets these sayings as source material about the early Jesus-movement before 70 CE, whereas the latter (140-165) interprets them as a window on early Christianity's reaction to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Siegert takes Mark 14:58 as the starting point for his survey in search of the historical Jesus in relation to the Temple. After its interpretation within the context of Mark and in comparison with the other canonical Gospels, Siegert deals with the subject of Jesus' relation to contemporary Judaism and rightly criticises a tendency to represent Jesus as irenic in the interest of the Jewish-Christian dialogue for being a-historical (123-124). Siegert, however, concludes that the interpretation of the Temple saying can be related to an early Christian perspective on Jesus in a more certain way than to the historical Jesus (132). This early Christian perspective understood the Temple saying as a symbol of Jesus' death and resurrection. When Siegert goes on to write about the early Christians' breakaway from the Temple and about a contemporary background to 'spiritualisation' of sacrifices (134-137) he finds himself on less sure ground in my view. That is, λογική λατρεία in Rom 12:1, which Siegert mentions on page 136, may not be an example of 'spiritual' worship,4 and Acts 21:17-25, among other texts, instead attests to the commitment of the Jerusalem church to the Temple ser vice before 70 CE. Liicking's article deals with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple as an experience of crisis among early Christians. He therefore reads Mark as "document of the crisis of 70 CE" (141). In this respect, Lucking throws a different light on Mark 14:58 as a 'false Temple saying,' that is, the false accusation against Jesus. According to Lucking, the Markan author has a very positive idea of the Temple per se (Mark 11:15-18), but refers to the false accusation against Jesus (Mark 14:57-58) to illustrate the corruption of the priestly establishment (157). Lucking finally provides an insightful analysis</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF BOOKS 85 of the narrative in Mark 13 and 14-15 as a reaction to the crisis of 70 CE (157-161, 162-163). The eighth article, by Sabine Panzram, (166-182) discusses a rich diver sitysity of evidence (numismatic, historiographic, and epigraphic) in order to re evaluate the Roman perspective on Jews and the Jewish religion during and after the Jewish war (66-70 CE). Panzram opposes the influential scholarly opinion that Rome's perspective on Judaism could be solely characterised by the fiscus Iudaicus and Tacitus' digression on the Jews. Panzram's survey is refreshing in that it puts Roman power politics against Judaea in a broader perspective, without necessarily relativising the catastrophe of the Jewish war. Thus, she observes for instance that, parallel to the fiscus Asiaticus, the fiscus Iudaicus Iudaicus provided the Roman government with the "resources from the rich est provinces in the empire" in Vespasian's time (178). The ninth article, by Konrad Schmid, (183-206) analyses the composition of the late first-century CE text 4 Esra in relation to the catastrophe of 70 CE. Schmid's careful analysis shows that 4 Esra reinforces the importance of the Law even in view of the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, which 4 Esra Esra interprets as the ultimate punishment for the 'wicked heart' of the peo pie according to Schmid (195-196). On the basis of the broader context of apocalyptic literature, Schmid concludes that the paradox of God's salvation in view of the destruction of the Temple is solved in 4 Esra by the apoca lyptic idea of two aeons (196-201). The parallels between 4 Esra's anthropol ogy and Pauline literature to which Schmid points by way of epilogue might merit the attention of a separate study. The tenth article, by Giinter Stemberger, (207-236), which deals with reactions to the destruction of the Second Temple in rabbinic literature, para doxically observes that reactions of lamentation are kept in the background in the earliest rabbinic literature (Mishnah, Tosefta, and halakhic midrashim). As Stemberger convincingly explains, this in turn was a rabbinic reaction to the repression of Messianic and apocalyptic tendencies which culminated in the Bar Kochba revolt (207-215). With regard to the later rabbinic literature, the Pales tinian Talmud and midrashim from the fifth century, StembergeA survey (215 223) evaluates the aspects of substitution for the destroyed Temple. He explains the absence of expectations that the Temple would be rebuilt as due to the failed attempt of the emperor Julian (361-363) to achieve this (223). Stemberger finally surveys reactions to the destruction of the Second Temple in rabbinic writings up to the seventh century, including the Babylonian Talmud, and con eludes that older traditions about the Temple were transmitted, but also trans formed in view of later circumstances; the Temple became an eschatological symbol. The failed attempt of the emperor Julian (361-363) to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple is the subject of the eleventh and final article of this symposium vol ume, written by Johannes Hahn (237-262). Hahn's discussion takes the different</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW OF BOOKS 86 Christian and pagan perspectives as well as the perspective of Julian himself in the sources into account. This discussion opens a multifaceted perspective on the clash between the restoration of traditional cults (both Jewish and pagan), as envisaged by Julian, and the church as the established religious power in the Roman empire, as envisaged by many Christian church fathers. ^erstorungen^erstorungen des Jerusalemer Tempels is a thought-provoking symposium vol ume, in which the respective authors at times react to each other's theses and at times fundamentally differ from each other. It is a well-documented book and may be of interest both to scholars specialised in biblical studies, Judaism, early Christianity, and ancient history and to systematic theologians who look for a historical test case concerning experiences of religious crisis.

The "reasoned worship" in Rom 12:1 contrasts with the conformity to the world surrounding the Roman congregations (cf. Rom 12:2); in my view it does not necessarily contrast with the "worship" mentioned in Rom 9:4.</page></plain_text>
