Stern HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM suggests three separate models for conceptualizing the mashal: as illustration, as secret speech, as rhetorical narrative. The thematic messages of most meshalim can be phrased in terms of praise or blame. In chapter three, he addresses the poetics of the mashal.

Finally, he takes up one of the most important questions in 500</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books midrashic study: the use of anthropomorphism and its function in this literature. Chapter four focuses upon the thematics of the midrashic mashal, and there Stern claims that the mashal's message is essentially a functional category. The categories he isolates for special attention and illustration are: apologetics, polem- ics, eulogy and consolation, complaint, regret, and warning. Under each category, he brings representative passages which he carefully analyzes to illustrate the message he derives and how it fits into the larger categories. This chapter is of particu- lar value in providing a framework for understanding to those who are relatively new to midrashic literature. One of the most perplexing questions to the student of Mid- rash is the precise nature of this material, its place of origin, and the details of the compositional process. As mentioned above, the compilers/editors/authors did not provide critical in- troductions to their works; thus, many scholarly points of view are to be found regarding the nature of the larger documents in which the rabbinic meshalim are located. In chapter five, Stern places the rabbinic mashal in its larger context as he under- stands that context. He asserts that the various midrashic col- lections "remain to all appearances more like anthologies of traditional Rabbinic interpretations that an anonymous editor selected and recorded than like self-contained, logically struc- tured books in their own right" (p. 152). In this discussion, I would have appreciated more attention to the distinctions between the two genres of Midrash: the exegetical/halakhic midrashim, such as the Mekhilta D'Rabbi Ishmael, and the homiletical midrashim, such as Leviticus Rabbah or Pesikta D'Rav Kahana. Whereas the exegetical midrashim clearly are "verso-centric," to quote Stern (p. 154) quoting James Kugel, I find that "text" in the homiletical midrashim is often merely "pretext." Further, I side with those who see logic and structure in what are termed "literary homilies." Stern sees the homilet- ical midrashim more as pieces of lessons once delivered ser- monically as well as "editorial constructs, intended perhaps to serve as aids for preachers in need of material for their own sermons" (p. 154). These questions of the larger structure are not crucial to Stern's central concern, which is the smaller literary rhetorical units of the Midrash, especially the mashal. In chapter five, he discusses the role of the mashal in the homily, its relationship to the technical structure the petihta, or proem, its place in aggadic narrative, its use in relationship to the exegetical enumeration, and instances of meshalim used in a series. Ex- amples are well selected and analyzed with clarity. In the final chapter, Stern traces the history of the mashal in Hebrew literature from its supposed origins in the ancient Near East up to its use by modern Hebrew writers such as Ag- non. He examines the use of the parable in the synoptic Gos- pels to compare it with rabbinic meshalim. He analyzes the parable of The Wicked Husbandmen in depth, since it uses and interprets a scriptural prooftext in a rabbinic way, and he briefly analyzes the eleven other parables attributed to Jesus in the three synoptic Gospels. He concludes that "Jesus used the parable (insofar as the Gospel narratives tell us) in essentially the same way as the Rabbis employed the mashal-in public contexts (sermons or preaching), and as an instrument for praise and blame, often directed at the persons present in the audience" (p. 200). The book contains two valuable appendices: the first de- scribes the various nonparabolic narrative genres in rabbinic literature; the second provides Hebrew critical texts for the twenty-four meshalim from Lamentations Rabbah which Stern used as his principal illustrative material. Of enormous worth are the forty-six pages of notes, which provide extensive ref- erences to articles and books which deal with virtually every subject mentioned. This is a book to be studied carefully, not merely read. The author's extensive knowledge of classics and comparative lit- erature as well as rabbinics gives breadth and perspective to his treatment. For the student of rabbinic literature or for the generalist whose interest is in religion and its various narra- tive forms, David Stern has provided a valuable resource. EDWARD A. GOLDMAN HEBREW UNION COLLEGE Towards a Grammar of Biblical Poetics: Tales of the Proph- ets. By HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO. New York: OXFORD UNI- VERSITY PRESS, 1992. Pp. xv + 298. $35. H. C. Brichto is a product of mid-twentieth-century biblical scholarship, having studied under E. A. Speiser and his col- leagues at the University of Pennsylvania. He was thus trained in a philological-historical-comparative approach, with plenty of ancient Near Eastern languages and texts against which to read the Bible. Add to this the literary approaches to the Bible of the 1970s and '80s. It is all these which largely inform the book under review. Brichto's analyses are not the avant garde post-structuralist readings which are accessible only to the initiated. They are, rather, more like the close readings of earlier literary scholars, especially New Critics, but with an appreciation of historical context that the New Critics eschewed. There is still a strong hint that Brichto is in pursuit of the "original" meaning, yet he acknowledges a certain indeterminacy of meaning-or at least the possibility that others will see things that he has not dis- cerned. Like most literary critics, he assumes the unity of the piece that he examines. But he goes farther than many in stat- ing that a poetical grammar is a "set of rules that will show 501</page></plain_text>
