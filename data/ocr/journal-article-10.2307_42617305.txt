<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Meaning of Job 4,18 I. The hapax legomenon in 4,18 The Book of Job is generally acclaimed as the greatest poem of ancient or modern times. Terrien wrote: "The literary mastery of the poet is unsurpassed in the Old Testament, and his stylistic versatility, vigor, conciseness and elegance are probably superior to those of any other poet" A special position in this unusual book is held by Eliphaz's speeches. Rowley characterized them by saying: "The speech of Eliphaz is one of the masterpieces of the book" 2. Job 4,1 8 is one of the verses in Eliphaz's first speech. It reads: If he cannot trust His own servants, N1? VOJO jíl And casts reproach on His angels 3, ^¡IFl ET ET This verse was subject to considerable debate because of the hapax legomenon H'Xin, which elicited much guess-work. Dhorme observes that "L'hapax ìlbìlH a choqué quelques commentateurs" 4. Though much exegetical effort focused on deciphering the meaning ofn'Ttn, still one cannot confidently state that a satisfactory solution has been found. Chaham, in a somewhat optimistic spirit, says that despite the many different interpretations that have been offered, "anyway the meaning is clear" 5. What seems to be clear from the conclusion of the a minori ad majus (gal wahomer in Talmudic terminology) struc- ture in w. 1 8- 1 9, and the parallelism of the cola in v. 1 8, is that v. 1 8b must also express some dissatisfaction with God's emissaries 6.

Some attribute them to the "voice" (v. 16), others con- sider them to be Eliphaz's conclusion from the "visions of the night" 7 . The extent of the dream vision is not clear. It could consist of only verse 17, with verses 18-21 being Eliphaz's exposition. Many assume that the vision continues to the end of the chapter. Among the reasons for this position are: the continued use of the third person for God (in v. 17 and v. 18); the explanatory "Behold" in v. 18; the request for agreement in v. 2 1 ; and the clear transition in 5,1 to that addressing Job's complaints in chapter 3. Others felt the debating style requires a referent that is not the "voice" itself. It is also not clear who is referred to in the terms "his servants" (V~QIJ) and "his angels" (VDN^Ö), and what is the distinction between the two categories. Moreover, it is not obvious how one should understand the term CP Ü, and what is the extent of its se- mantic field? Finally, one would be naturally intrigued by the rela- tion between 4,18 and the seemingly similar variants in Eliphaz's second speech (15,15) and in Bildad's speech (25,5)? The purpose of this paper is to respond to these questions by pre- senting a new interpretation of H "TÍH, elucidating the terms used in v. 18, and discussing the meaning of the verse in its context. II. Problems of Terminology in Job 4,18 In Job 4,18 and 15,15 Eliphaz refers to some obscure tra- dition regarding God's attitude towards his heavenly agents, to but- tress his argument with respect to humans. Whybray says: "The background to this statement about the angels is obscure. There is certainly no idea here of rebellious or 'fallen' angels as in some of the apocryphal literature and in later theology, though the myth of the 'sons of God' who intermarried with human women (Gen. 6. 1- ("light"), to a major or more strict one ("weighty"), or vice versa, forming an a fortiori argument. 7 F.I. Andersen, Job. An Introduction and Commentary (London 1 976) 114.</page><page sequence="3">502 Aron Pinker 4) may belong to the same tradition"8. Subsequently, Bildad para- phrases the same notion in 25,5 referring only to celestial bodies, the moon and the stars. How did commentators fuse these para- phrases into a single concept? The analysis of v. 18 will first focus on the inner- verse referents for VIDU and 1 then assess the current understanding of D^ET, and finally discuss the current status of the term rònn. 1. The terms V12V andVD*bl2 The terms "Dû and ~[N have the basic meanings "slave, ser- vant" and "messenger", respectively. The Septuagint's rendering of these terms by "servant" (Traís) and "angel" (ayyeÀoç) indicates that it understood them as being heavenly entities, and so apparently did the Peshitta, which uses the terms and "THDN 7ÖD, and the Vulgate, which uses qui serviunt and angelis. The Targums by translating "his servants the prophets" (W'DD "'I'TDUD) and "his messengers, runners" CIXIÏÎ^), understood the referent to be both earthly and heavenly. A similar diversity of views can be found among the classical Jewish exegetes. Rashi (1040-1 105) considers "servants" being the righteous and "messengers" being apparently the angels. Ibn Ezra (1089-c. 1 164) considers both categories referring to heavenly en- tities, and so does Rashbam (c. 1085-1174) 9. Ralbag (1288-1344) seems to be associating 4,18a and 15,15a, taking "his servants" as "his holy", apparently holy persons. He understands v. 18 as stating that God is the cause of all but not caused by anyone else. It is not clear from Ramban's (1194-1270) statement that "neither 'his ser- vants' nor 'his emissaries' are privy to God's secrets" whether these two categories are heavenly entities or not. Among the modern commentators the diversity is considerably more limited. For instance, Duhm considers VIDU and TDK being made of "der edlen, feineren Materie, der FHT' 10.

This position cannot be correct.</page><page sequence="4">On the Meaning of Job 4, 1 8 503 lelism of the two cola in 4,18 forces the conclusion that the servants are the angels of 18b, and this position is supported by the narrative frame (1,6; 2,1) and by the parallelism between "angels" and "those who serve him" in Ps 104,4 12 . However, Ps 104,4 does not speak of angels, but rather of natural phenomena: He makes the winds his mes- sengers, fiery flames his servants. Chaham says that the two terms refer to the OTi^n 'n in 1,6 and 2,1, but not to earthly righteous l3. In Pope's view the two terms allude to "the lesser gods who with the de- velopment of monotheism became angels. ... In the Ugaritic myths, the major deities have special divine lackies who mostly serve as mes- sengers" 14. A more realistic perception of the two terms has been sug- gested by Tur-Sinai who says: "According to the parallel passages, the reference is not only to angels and divine beings proper, but also to the sun, the moon, stars which too are still felt to be godly beings, God's servants and messengers" 15. It is doubtful that Tur-Sinai's catch-all ap- proach can be logically defended. Jastrow renders the terms VIDI? and TDK by "servants" and "messengers," respectively l6. The prevailing opinion seems to be that the terms Vini? and TDK1» refer to supernatural entities. This is almost required by the comparison in w. 1 8- 1 9, but is not compelling. As Weiss noted, while the views held by commentators can be inferred from juxtaposing the two opposing positions in the qal wahomer, they are not explicitly stated in the text 17. Indeed, as will be shown, the two terms admit meanings which are more realistic than the world of angels and heav- enly courts, and which are also theologically less problematic. 12 Dhorme, Job, 53. 13 Chaham, 3VÄ, 35. Similarly, Habel says: "Perhaps the poet is again making an ironic allusion to roving members of the heavenly court, such as Satan, who challenge God's judgment (1,6-10)". Cf. N.C. Habel, The Book of Job: A Commentary (Philadelphia, PA 1985) 129. 14 M.H. Pope, Job (AB 15; Garden City, NY 1986) 37. 15 N.H. Tur-Sinai, The Book of Job (Jerusalem 1967) 85. Hartley appar- ently adopts a similar approach, saying: "The angels or messengers are those who serve (□,'1I1U) God (Ps 104,4)". Cf. J.E. Hartley, Book of Job (NICOT; Grand Rapids, MI 1988) 114. 16 M. Jastrow, The Book of Job. The Origin, Growth and Interpretation (Philadelphia, PA 1920) 212. 17 M. Weiss, "TET7N 70 ]HDtnn 1Û1ÏU3 miBBDn", TVT "ISO "JOTin (eds. A. Eliner et al.) (Jerusalem 1962) 188. Weiss points to the fact that the two metaphors are not fully parallel. For instance, v. 1 8 does not have something that corresponds to 1017 Till in v. 19; it does not allude to those that dwell up high in heaven.</page><page sequence="5">504 Aron Pinker 2. The term D,ET The term D^ET usually means "he will put, place, set". The Sep- tuagint renders D^ET by "he perceives" (È Trevosas); Targums by "imputes" Ç1VT); Symmachus by "find" (súprjasi) and is followed by the Vulgate ( repperit ) and by the Peshitta "he struck" (D,D3). Driver and Gray render "2 □''ET by "to lay in" (= "attribute to") based on 1 Sam 1 1,15 18. Relying on the same source, the following are some of the translations that have been offered: Chaham - "decides that there is" 19; Ewald, Duhm, Gallischewski - "places", "legt er bei" 20; Driver &amp; Gray, Fullerton, Tur-Sinai, Gibson, Pope, Clines, Gordis - "charges with, imputes";21 Dillman, Blommerde, Habel, Good - "ascribes" 22; Jastrow, Horst, Grabbe - "he notes" 23; and, Beuken - "he points out" 24 . It is obvious that the Versions had no idea how to translate here CET , and resorted to meanings that they thought would fit the con- text.

The term n*?nn The hapax legomenon n^nn presented considerable challenges to commentators since the earliest times of biblical exegesis. The Sep- tuagint rendered ¡"I 'XID by "perverseness, crookedness" (okoAiov) and is followed by the Vulgate ( pravitatem ); the Targums by "unright- eousness" (N'TT) 25; Symmachus by "folly" ((jaxaiOTriTa); and the Peshitta by "amazement" With regard to this unique term it is obvious that the versions were again at a loss how to translate it and resorted to meanings that they thought would fit the context. The following are some of the solutions that were suggested for the interpretation of Hariri : - Emend n^nntoH^sn ("unseemliness"). Rationale: (a) The word n^sn occurs in a phrase with WW (Job 24,12); (b) all but one letter are the same as in Hariri; (c) ¡1 bnn has been miswritten for Î1 26; and (d) the phrase WW H bun is similar to the phrase il ]I~ID (Job 1,22) 21 . Objection: (a) The word nbsn also occurs in a phrase with the word TViTI (Jer 23,13); (b) The Ketib-Qere apparatus does not at- test to a H/S confusion; the letters il and S are orthographically dissimilar in both the paleoscript and the square script; and the ra- tionale in (d) represents circuitous reasoning. - H ^nn is derived from the root III b bu ("be deceived, foolish, mad"). Rationale: (a) All the versions (LXX, Targum, Peshitta, Sym- machus, Vulgate) use a word for ¡1 'XIH that is equivalent to "folly" or "transgression" 28; (b) the forms "blemish" (from ^D),D0Fl "fusion" (from DDÖ) allow one to assume a word TIFI (from 7^h) 25 Grabbe, Comparative, 4 1 . This meaning ofN is based on the read- ing N /"¡r. Jastrow, 1070a, mentions the meaning "pretext", which well fits the context. 26 Driver - Gray, Critical, 25. 27 Chaham, 3T"», 35. 28 Grabbe, Comparative, 41.

Rationale: The meaning is based on a Semitic word that has sim- ilar spelling. Objection: The meaning has low likelihood since it is based on a word occurring only in Ethiopian. - Derive the meaning of ¡1 from an Arabic word with sim- ilar spelling. Rationale: (a) There are words in cognate languages which con- tain the consonants H ^ÌIH and have a meaning that fits the context of 18b: in Arabic wahila "to go astray," tahil "to be fetid," thahlal "vain", tahwîl "threat, reproof' 34 . 29 Dhorme, Job, 53. 30 Beuren, "Eliphaz", 301, n. 25. 31 Grabbe, Comparative , 42. 32 Driver - Gray, Critical, 25.

Tur-Sinai says that ¡1 /HTi "may also be a derivative - originally perhaps pronounced ¡1 'pHFi - of the root *71 ¡1 with the meaning of the Arabic tahwîl "threat, reproof'. However, the root 7IÌ7 is not attested in biblical Hebrew (cf. Jastrow, 339a).</page><page sequence="8">On the Meaning of Job 4, 1 8 507 Objection: Since these roots do not occur in Hebrew, it would mean that H bilH is a foreign word; only approximations of ¡7 ^iin occur in cognate languages; an etymology that is based on Hebrew should be preferred 35; and the sense "err" for wahila is rare in clas- sical Arabic 36. - Derive the meaning of H ^¡"IH from Aramaic "" bu ("to be faint, to labor"). Rationale: (a) The derivation of H ^¡"IH is not forced; and, (b) the meaning of "weakness" fits the context. Objection: The origin of the word ^ I is unknown; and, the root is unattested in other Semitic languages. - Emend n^nn to il *pnn from bnn ("deceive, mock").

Objection: The reading "and ascribes no glory to his angels" does not convey any deficiency in the angels, which would be on a par with being "untrustworthy"; and, in the apparent paraphrase of this verse 35 Dhorme,Joò, 53. 36 Clines, Job , 112.

Also Tur-Sinai {Job, 85) says: "This word has, perhaps correctly, been explained as a metathetic variant of H 'TIPI". 38 See for instance, A.B. Ehrlich, Randglossen zur hebräischen Bibel, VI.

The second option is to derive II bun from the Arabic wahila 45. Grabbe's conclusion is based on the assumption that the required meaning for Ì1 'TÍH is "be foolish". However, this assumption is log- ically questionable and certainly unsupported by the majority of the versions 46. Many commentators opted to translate H 'TIP by "folly, error," perhaps believing that such a sense would provide some ex- planation for the injustice on earth.

These malfunctions as well as human wickedness to- wards his fellow man cause the justice system between mankind and God to be sometimes out of symmetrical order (4,18) 47. This description presents Job as naively primitive. It shifts much of the evil and misfortune in the world from God to angels and men; a theology that would be at odds with the normative thinking at any period suggested for the formation of the book. It would be also very difficult within the confines of monotheism to attribute folly (i.e., irrational behavior) to angels - entities whose function is completely prescribed by God. Similarly, attributing to angels the possibility of erring would stretch the anthropomorphic metaphor well beyond the common understanding of angels. More- over, accepting the possibility that angels could err would imply that prophets could inaccurately transmit God's message, and conse- quently the theological foundation of the entire Bible would be un- dermined. It is doubtful that the author would not have realized the danger in such a position. Finally, assigning to H "Tin the meaning "foolish, err" leads to the doctrine of universal sinfulness, which contradicts the doctrine of retribution in Eliphaz's first speech. Neither "folly" nor "error" is an acceptable option for n^iin. Clearly, the meaning of 4,18 is still unsettled. III. Problems of Interpretation The assumption that the terms VQU and TDK bö refer to super- natural entities, coupled with the perception that these entities could engage in improper behavior, leads to problematic theological conse- quences. For instance, Gibson's frustration with 4,18 can be felt from his words: "We do not know the background, mythological no doubt, to these disturbing verses, unless it be something to do with fallen an- gels (cp. Gen. 6. 1 -2). But the manner in which Eliphaz employs them is so reckless as to be not worthy of Job himself'. In Gibson's view the verses imply "a capricious deity, who sows discord in the heavenly places and permits ignorance on earth"48. 47 G.V. Smith, "Job IV 12-21: is it Eliphaz's vision?", VT 40 (1990) 463. 48 Gibson, "Eliphaz", 267.</page><page sequence="11">5 1 0 Aron Pinker Clearly, any suggestion that angels could err, or act foolishly, lewdly, and wickedly would undermine all the cases in which an- gels are mentioned in the Bible as messengers of God 49. How can they be trusted if God does not trust them, noting that they can err, or even engage in folly? How can the words of the prophets be trusted if the words of the angels cannot be trusted? The learned author of the book would not have put such suggestions into a prophetic vision which he wanted to be trusted. Thus it is impossi- ble that the statement in 4,18 was said by the "voice" that Eliphaz hears. Indeed, were it the case that the voice states 4,18, then it would open whatever it says to doubt, including the statement in 4,18, turning the entire vision into a paradoxical message. The au- thor could not have presented the philosophical character "Eliphaz" as one that makes contradictory statements. While Eliphaz would have reported 4,18 as part of the vision, he would have never made a statement of this kind by himself. Angels were often the bearers of God's word, their faithfulness in execution of this function is never questioned in the Bible, and it is axiomatic that they can and must be trusted 50. Barton's suggestion that in Gen 6,2 and 1 Kgs 22,21-23 we have a case of "bad" angels is without merit 51 . In neither of the cases cited is the word or Cf mentioned. In either of the cases the text can be well explained without resorting to the concept "angel". In 6,2 the DTI could be "the sons of the leaders" (see Taigum Onkelos), and in 1 Kgs 22,21-23 there is a play on the word ITH "spirit (of the dead?)" and the phrase "1 ptö ITH ("spirit of falseness") in a metaphor based on the royal court. Use of a similar form, ITH ("spirit of discord"), in Judg 9,23 clearly shows that m~l has nothing to do with angels. Indeed, since this court consists of the celestial bodies (D^QUTT &amp;3Ü) it cannot refer to angels. More- 49 Angels are mentioned for instance in the Tanach in Gen 16,7-1 1; 18,1- 16; 28,10-12; Exod 3,2; 23,20-21; 2 Sam 24,16-17; 1 Kgs 19,5-8; Zee 1,9.14; 2,2; 2,7-9; 4,1; Pss 34,8; 91,11-12; 103,20; Dan 6,19-22; 8,16; 9,21; 10,13; 12,1; etc. Copleston observes that Philo of Alexandria identified the angel with the Logos, as the immaterial voice of God. Thus, the angel is God's in- strument, not God himself. Cf. F.C. Copleston, A History of Philosophy (New York 2003) 1, 460. 50 Barton, Commentary, 8 1 . 51 Gibson, "Eliphaz", 262. Gibson dubs "Eliphaz a Hebrew philosopher", a DDI! or "wise man". He describes him as a "complicated, and cultured, opinionated and skeptical old scholar".</page><page sequence="12">On the Meaning of Job 4, 1 8 511 over, in 1 Kgs 22,21-23 the "spirit" executes a desired function - it is neither good nor bad. Finally, in Ps 82, 1 and especially Ps 82,6- 7 seemingly "gods" and "sons of the Most High" are mentioned, with whom God might be perceived finding fault. Clearly, Ps 82,1 is intended to suggest that God is the iudge of judges and that he is in the company of the most powerful (7N Hlil). The text of Ps 82,2- 7 refers only to humans, and in this sense should DTT^Ä ("judge, judges") and ]V bV'^1'2 ("descendants of the elite") be understood. Only in the book of Enoch (200-170 BCE) are angels divided into good and bad, and the bad angels play a role in the corruption of the world. Even if a statement such as 4, 1 8 floated in the popular lore at the time the Book of Job was written, Eliphaz would have been careful not to use it for constructing his main argument in this particular setting. It is patently clear that the terms VIDU and TDK1» cannot refer to supernatural entities. IV. Proposed Solution Eliphaz's rephrase of 4,18 in 15,15, and Bildad's rephrase in 25,5 in a non-visionary context point to the true understanding of the statement in 4,18. In 15,15 Eliphaz says: He puts no trust in His holy ones; 'fOtV N b "ItZTTpB The heavens are not guiltless in His sight V]I?3 Ì3TN b CGlTi This verse can be understood as referring to the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars) set apart (i.e., "holy" = HZTTp) at the time of creation for a stated purpose (Gen 1,14-18) of providing a fixed ser- vice 52 . The heavens (□"'ftü), where meteorological phenomena orig- inate, have also been set for their function at creation (Gen 1,6-8), albeit their function is of a sporadic nature. This understanding per- 52 Smith, "Job", 455-456. Smith notes that commentators "struggle to find a reason why Eliphaz thought Job might call on the holy ones [5,1], but these interpretations are not entirely satisfactory". Dillmann, Hiob, 38, notes that "der Ausdruck □,Knp (5,1. 15,15) auch von den Engeln nur relativ zu ver- stehen ist". The interpretation of E71"Tp that is being suggested here provides also a natural explanation for 5,1 and various verses in the Psalms (cf. Ps 89,6 and Ps 19,2). Eliphaz tells Job that directing his anger to the sun (3,4), moon (3,6), and stars (3,9) can have no effect.</page><page sequence="13">512 Aron Pinker fectly fits the two terms VIDI? and TDK bö in 4,18. The first colon (4, 1 8a) refers to the fixed celestial bodies in the firmament; those are His "servants" (VQI}), doing their fixed and permanent assign- ments. Some of these functions are described in Pss 19,6-7, 74,16-17, 103,23, 104,4, etc. The second colon (4,18b) refers to God's agents doing sporadic tasks; those are His "messengers" (TDK 53. Some of their functions are described in Pss 103,20, 104,4, 135,7; 147,15- 18; 148,8, etc. This perception of the two terms Villi} and finds also strong support in the words of Bildad (25,5): Even the moon is not bright, 8*71 FlT'li? ]il And the stars are not pure in His sight TlID 13!"^ b ITDIllDl which introduce the celestial bodies moon and stars, in a qal wahomer structure that is similar to that in 4,19-19, and a text that partially re- peats the words in 15,15b. In Tur-Sinai's opinion, "According to the parallel passages, the reference is not only to angels and divine beings proper, but also to the sun, the moon and stars, which too are felt to be godly beings, God's servants and messengers" 54. This paper argues that Tur-Sinai's partial admission is insufficient. Indeed, if it assumed that in the parallel passages parallelism extends to the corresponding cola (i.e., 4,18a |j 15, 15a || 25,5a and 4, 1 8b || 1 5, 15b J 25, 5b) then Vinr || lüip ("holy") || FIT ("moon") and D CTÖ0 ("heavens") || D^ITG ("stars"). The only way to make these parallelisms logically coherent is by accepting that in all these similar cases (4,18; 15,5; 25,5) the reference is to celestial bodies and phenomena, not angels or supernatural entities. Indeed, Berechiah ben Natronai (Ha-nakdan) (12th-! 3th CE) observed: "I find it most probable that the expression "his servants" is used here [4, 1 8] as in the last speech of Bildad the Shuhite (xxv. 5)" 55. It should not come as a surprise that God was perceived as not being always pleased with His creation. As beautiful, wise, and 53 This distinction between "servants" and "messengers" explains the strange addition of DDirQ in 1,6. Since the D'il ,]D were servants and TEDE? was a messenger, he should not have appeared among those not of his kind. 54 Tur-Sinai, Job, 85. 55 S.A.

The initial creation was thus the main stage in a creation process which is still in progress and to which man could also contribute. This has been intimated in the seemingly superfluous word DWVb in Gen 2,3, which in Jewish tradition indicated the continuous need for □ |lpTl ("repair of the world"). For instance one finds in the Midrash: "Everything that was created in the six days of creation needs some additional 'fixing'. For instance, mustard needs sweetness added to it, lupines need sweetness added to them, wheat needs to be grinded, and even man needs repair (circumcision)" 56. From this perspective the inan- imate celestial bodies and natural phenomena could be subject to God's displeasure because of various anomalies, which the ancients may have observed. Because of the "personification" of the celes- tial entities and phenomena, the ancients viewed these anomalies as indiscretions. This understanding of the two terms VQI? and is at the basis of the qal wahomer in w. 18-19. If God finds displeasure with the functioning of inanimate celestial bodies and natural phe- nomena, so much more so is this the case with human beings, which are of lowly make up (□TID"' "ISI7D) and precarious existence (tomas1? nntoT ). The comparison in the qal wahomer is be- tween the inanimate but permanent (sun, moon, stars, meteorolog- ical phenomena) and the animate but impermanent (humans). Since the two terms TÍHU and VDN 7Û cannot refer to angels, or some supernatural entities, attribution of anthropomorphic misbe- havior to them, even on a metaphoric level, would be inappropriate. It is still possible to say that God has no confidence in his "servants" the sun, moon, and stars, if this statement refers to their orbits and brightness. It is, however, impossible to attribute "folly" or "error" to meteorological phenomena. Thus, H "TÍH has to have a meaning that is appropriate for natural phenomena and human behavior. Such a concept is "speed" of the process, or "magnitude" of the event 57 . 56 Genesis Rabba 1 1,7. 57 Gibson, "Eliphaz", 266, n. 2. Apparently Gibson sensed the theological difficulties of assigning "madness" to angels, and consequently rendered H TID "rashness," a nuance of speed.</page><page sequence="15">514 Aron Pinker It is possible to obtain a meaning that describes the speed of a process, or magnitude of an event, if instead of H bilH the text is assumed to have been Hi"! 'n, a simple case of scribal error of metathesis 58. The word ilH ^Fl, kindred to its homophone îfijt ^Fi, is derived from the root HH b, "languish, faint," and is attested in Gen 47,13 in the imperfect, feminine singular (apocope), rÒH 59 . na bn occurs in 4,2 and N in 4,5; so it is possible that the hom- ophone Hü bn was written because of the ¡1/N confusion. This con- fusion is attested in the Tanach and Qumran scrolls 60. In Jerusalem Aramaic, the corresponding roots TP and b mean "to be tired" (Jastrow, 693b) 61 . Though rÒFlis a hapax legomenon its meaning cannot be doubted, because of its Aramaic cognates, occurrence in Ben Sira, and the seeming similarity between i"!!"!1? and ¡"IN1?. In- deed, it is possible that a scribe coming across the word Ì1Ì1 deemed it an error, because he could not recall the existence of the rare root nnb in the Bible, and deliberately changed it to the more familiar H 'TIH. Delitzsch seems to have rightly conjectured: "The form points to a Lamedh-He verb" 62 . 58 Grabbe, Comparative, 42. Grabbe writes: "The form [H *?nn] could easily come from a root *hly. Finding such a root, though, is rather difficult. . . . One suspects a case of metathesis. This suspicion becomes further con- firmed when a fairly thorough check fails to turn up any other example of a root *hly in Semitic". The suggested approach circumvents these difficulties. 59 The root Ihh is mentioned in L. Koehler - W. Baumgartner (eds.), A Bilingual Dictionary of the Hebrew and Aramaic Old Testament (Leiden 1998) 474, col. B. KB adds the form hitpalp (TI'TT'XIO) in Ben Sira. In both occurrences of rÒìl'rp in Ben Sira (Sir 35,14 and 15) it is the opposite ofETTR, which re- flects active pursuance. Thus, "languish, faint" for nil b would also well fit the texts in Ben Sira. Cf. A.Sh. Artom, ÄTD"]3 (Tel Aviv 1967) 117-118. 60 This confusion is attested, for instance, in Job 8,21 1170"' for KtIT; HS and NS in Job 38,11; (Ez 30,24) but pH] (Job 6,5); Qoh 8,1 MET for HDET; 2 Kgs 25,29; Lam 4,1; Ruth 1,20 «"113 for mû; 1 Kgs 22,25 and 2 Kgs 7,12 mnrn but «nnrn in 2 chr 18,24; isa 44,8 imri for imri; Jer 50,29 » b (Ketib) but ¡1 b (Qere); Ez 14,4 m (K) but »3 (Q); 2 Chr 20,35 -onn« for -nnnn; ez 14,3 aman for Ernnri; jer 25,3 d,dbk for D^ETt: Gen 41,43 "TQK for T"On; Ps 76,6 1 EM for 1 ^"IDET!; Isa 63,3 TlbïUK for ^ Vin; etc. 61 Targum (Lagarde's edition) renders in Isa 65,23 MIT* ("they will tire") by and in Isa 42,4 HniT ("he will dim, faint") by Jerusalem Targum has in Deut 25,18 for ("tired").

It is possible that God considers some natural events lacking sufficient force or quickness of movement. From this perspective, the neutral sense of "he notes" would be most appropriate for □"'ET in 4,18b. Indeed, Grabbe suggested such an interpretation without any elu- cidation 63. However, some support for this sense of CT ET can be garnered from in 4,20b, where the meaning "notice" would aptly fit 64. Also, in Jerusalem Aramaic the corresponding I DID could mean "to mark, name, to distinguish" (Jastrow, 965a), a sense that is very close to "note". One finds it in the Jerusalem Tal- mud use oWD in the sense of "they noted" (y. Ber acho 1 5,9; y. Megilla 1 ,7 1 ;y. D 'mai 5,24; y. Shabbath 6,8). The sense "he notes" would also well fit OCT in 1 Sam 22, 1 5, which is often used in sup- port of the generally accepted meaning "imputes, attributes". If the preceding understandings of the critical terms in v. 4,18 are accepted, then this verse can be rendered: "Behold, in His ser- vants He does not trust, and in His emissaries He notes weakness". Taking this interpretation as the minori part of the qal wahomer re- sults in a conclusion that it is reasonable for God not to trust humans and note weaknesses in them. Such an attitude would be justified even with respect to Job, whom Eliphaz apparently considered to be righteous (4,6). Fullerton correctly explains Eliphaz's attitude saying that Eliphaz does not accuse Job of any specific sins which might account for his suffering. Eliphaz refers only to "the general sinfulness of man which is inherent in man's creatureliness" 65. Job must expect to suffer, not because he sinned but because he was a man, and no man can be clean in the eyes of his creator. From this conclusion would also follow the possibility that God tests the righ- teous (5,17) so that they could manifest being worthy of his trust, or for the sake of guiding them to this status (5,18). The comparison in the qal wahomer is only an example of the more fundamental comparison between God's creation and human deeds encapsulated in the rhetorical questions in 4,17: 63 Grabbe, Comparative, 41. 64 See Clines, Job, 1 13-114, for some ofthe opinions regarding vDÖ. 65 Fullerton, "Entendre", 328.</page><page sequence="17">516 Aron Pinker Can a mortal be more right than God? m *780 KJIDNH Can a man be more faultless than his Maker? llïtOUQ Dtjt Commentators generally felt that this verse cannot mean: "Can man be more righteous than God?" Any man sound of mind would agree that man cannot be more righteous than God - there is no need to state the obvious. Moreover, such understanding would not agree with 5,18-27 and does not fit Job's case, since he never claims to be more righteous than God. What then could the vision be conveying? The keyword in 4,17 is HÜU ("to make"), which clearly stands out when this verse is compared to 15,14 and 25,4. It refers to God as man's creator, and thus must be alluding to creation and its im- perfection 66. This verse, without having the formal rhetoric struc- ture, is also a qal wahomer, albeit an implied one. The questions must consequently be understood in the following way: If there are imperfections in God's creation, then there obviously must be im- perfections in a mortal's deeds, since he cannot be more perfect than his creator (inüUO) 67. Eliphaz's vision, which in a dramatic manner presents his fun- damental theological perspective, is certainly true within the bibli- cal framework and appropriate for the situational context 68. It is, however, woefully unbalanced. It leaves out the other side of the coin: the enormous perfection that does exist in God's creation and the high levels of personal perfection that are attainable by mortals. 66 Beuken, "Eliphaz", 302. Beuken also understands the passage 4,17-18 from a creational perspective, rather than forensic or moralistic point of view. However, he takes Eliphaz's message to be that God does not even "encounter a lack of fidelity and wisdom among his 'servants/messengers,' but that the said moral characteristics do not count for him". Beuken does not provide any textual support for his opinion. Gibson ("Eliphaz", 265) also felt that Eliphaz "adds some thoughts on God which he himself obviously considers to be so daring that he has to justify them by claiming a special revelation". Unfortunately, he does not specify what these thoughts might be. 67 Tur-Sinai, Job, 84. Tur-Sinai notes that rendering 4, 1 7a "Is man more just than God?" or "Does man act justly toward God?" makes no sense, since it does not matter to the speaker "whether or not man acts justly towards God or could be juster than he". He translates: "Can man have justice from God? Will man be found pure by his maker?" This forensic tenor does not agree with the following qal wahomer. 68 See for instance 1 Kgs 8,46; Pss 130,3; 143,3; Prov 20,9; Qoh 7,20; etc.</page><page sequence="18">On the Meaning of Job 4,18 517 Eliphaz tries in w. 5,9-10 to correct this impression. The balance is, however, set right only with God's speeches from the whirlwind. V. The Weakness of His Messengers Job 4,18 has been considered by many commentators as part of a mysterious nocturnal dream-vision experienced by Eliphaz 69 . Smith observes: "Since this vision is repeated three times and treats the central issue of the book, a person's righteousness before God, it must have an important role in the overall development of the theological argu- ment of the book" 70 . The content of the vision, however, seems to champion ideas "that were normative in Mesopotamian theology since the beginning of the second millennium". It is doubtful that the author wanted to rehash these old notions 71 . Whether the night vision de- scribed by Eliphaz was an actual heavenly communication, or believed to be such by Eliphaz, it is clear that he wanted the rhetorical questions in 4, 1 7 to have some unassailable imprimatur and to serve as the linch- pin of his argument 72 . Consequently, whether 4,18-19 is or is not part of the vision, 4,18 must be considered subsidiary to the theological frame setby 4,17. 69 Tur-Sinai, Job , 88-91; Ginsberg, "Job the patient and Job the impatient", Congress Volume. Rome 1968 (ed. J.A. Emerton) (SVT 17; Leiden 1969) 98-107, and Smith, "Job", 454-463, think Eliphaz quotes Job's vision. For instance, Tur- Sinai, Job , 88-89, argues: "Is it not, moreover, undeniable that the ideas expressed in the dream story are alien and even contrary to Eliphaz's train of thought?" Gins- berg is convinced that 4,12-20 originally stood at the end of chapter three. Smith, "Job", 454, argues: "if the central thesis of the vision is that no person can be just before God (iv 1 7), why do the friends consistently maintain the theological view that the righteous never perish (iv 7), that God judges the sinner and blesses the righteous (v 17, viii 3-6, 20, xi 13-20, xxii 21-9)?" For a more recent rebuttal of Tur-Sinai's arguments see Weiss, "Metaphor", 204-206, n. 59 p). 70 Smith, "Job", 453. Eliphaz usually relies on Wisdom tradition and his own experience. 71 G.L. Mattingly, "The Pious Sufferer: Mesopotamia's Traditional Theod- icy and Job's Counselors", The Bible in the Light of Cuneiform Literature (eds. W.W. Hallo et al.) (Scripture in Context III. Ancient Near Eastern Texts and Studies 8; Lewiston, NY 1990) 333. 72 Smith, "Job", 454. The fact that Bildad in 25,4-6 paraphrases 4,17-20, which are usually considered part of the vision, casts considerable doubt on the authenticity of Eliphaz's implied claim. It is possible that Bildad attempts to politely correct Eliphaz's theologically problematic exaggeration.</page><page sequence="19">518 Aron Pinker Eliphaz alludes in 4,17 to the more fundamental thesis, which can be formulated thus: If there are imperfections in God's creation, then there must be imperfections in a mortal's deeds. This appears to be Eliphaz's main thesis and failing. The qal wahomer in 4,18- 19 is an illustration of Eliphaz's thesis and 4,20-21 of his doctrinal failing. If God finds faults with inanimate natural phenomena, then there must be faults also with human beings. Eliphaz goes, how- ever, a step further. He reasons: If there are faults with human be- ings, then it makes sense that their lot is misery (4,20-21) 73 . In his view, Job "was a sinner as all men are sinners. Sin is inherent in mankind. Sin and therefore suffering are racial concomitants" 74. Thus, what Job considers an imperfection Eliphaz views as a proper state of being. Eliphaz failed because of a loss of sense of propor- tion. Andersen aptly notes "Eliphaz is following a path of truth that will lead him into a great error" 75 . Nowhere in the Tanach is distrust and misbehavior associated with heavenly beings or angels 76 . There is no reason for the author of the Book of Job to break with this tradition and introduce a no- tion undermining the theological foundation of the Tanach. The va- lidity of the qal wahomer in 4,18-19 is maintained when the terms VIZIU andTDKto are understood as referring to the set motions of the sun, moon, and stars as well as to the sporadic meteorological events, respectively. This understanding of the terms VIDU and "TDK bo allows also for a reasonable resolution of the seeming contradiction between the doctrine of retribution and the doctrine of universal sinfulness. In 4, 1 8 God's displeasure can only relate to the "manner" in which these inanimate bodies and phenomena execute their prescribed task. The qal wahomer in 4,18-19 implies that Eliphaz refers in 4,19 to God's possible displeasure with the "manner" in which righteous "acts" are executed by humans. It is possible to be a righteous person by per- forming only righteous acts. However, it is also possible simultane- ously to be deficient in the "manner" of performing the righteous 73 R. Gordis, The Book of Job (New York 1978) 518-519, n. 6. Eliphaz suggests that all people are imperfect sinful creatures, and no one can be just before God; therefore everyone can expect to suffer. 74 Fullerton, "Entendre", 330. 75 Andersen, Job, 114. 76 The obscure Gen 6,4 does not necessarily refer to heavenly beings.</page><page sequence="20">On the Meaning of Job 4,18 519 "acts". With this distinction in mind, the two doctrines can coexist. Moreover, such an understanding provides the same referents set for the three cases of qal wahomer in 4,18-19; 15,15-16; and 25,5-6. It also firmly establishes the notion that Eliphaz "does not relate to one or other moral foundation" 11 . It is from this perspective that the difficulty with the hapax legomenon Ì1 "TÍH can be resolved. The proposed reading: If he cannot trust His servants, T'P^. ^ And notices weakness in His messengers, '/Fi CÇT V I)fcjť7Ú!31 results in a text that does not involve any super-natural beings, does not resort to rare non-Hebrew words, does not involve addition of words, and is not theologically controversial. The verse is part of a qal wahomer intended to reinforce Eliphaz's message that Job has to look within for the cause of his misfortunes, because all people are imperfect sinful creatures, and no one can be just before God. 11519 Monticello Ave. Silver Spring, Maryland, 20902 U.S.A. Aron Pinker SUMMARY This paper argues that the terms VDU andVDN /C in Job 4, 18 should be understood as referring to the set motions of the sun, moon, and stars as well as to sporadic meteorological events, respectively. Such understanding does not dilute the validity and force of the qal wahomer in 4,18-19. The comparison is between the inanimate but permanent (sun, moon, stars, me- teorological phenomena) and the animate but impermanent (humans). The difficult il /(in is assumed to have been originally Hi! /Tl from nil /, "lan- guish, faint". Taking ¡1 *Xin as having the meaning "weakness" provides a sense that eminently fits a natural event. 77 Beuren, "Eliphaz", 301.</page></plain_text>
