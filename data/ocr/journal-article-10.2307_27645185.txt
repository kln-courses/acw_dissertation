The prize winner, who will be designated as a "Prometheus Laureate," is selected from nominations received from the Board of the APA by a specially appointed five-member subcommittee. The terms of this prize have been established in cooperation with the Prometheus Books. "There does not exist a Nobel Prize for philosophy," said Paul Kurtz, a member of the APA and the founder of Prometheus Books. Most Nobel Prizes are awarded to distinguished scientists who have contributed to the frontiers of knowledge, but heretofore no such recognition has been conferred upon a philosopher. The Prometheus Prize will be awarded every two years to a philosopher who (a) should be known for his or her contributions to philosophy and for breaking new ground in philosophy as it relates to the sciences; (b) should be well versed in the sciences; and (c) should demon strate in his or her work the cooperation between science and philosophy. Each "Prometheus Laureate" will receive a cash award of $10,000 and will deliver a lecture at a divisional meeting of the APA. In addition, Prometheus Books will offer the recipient a publishing contract for a work that will incor porate the ideas developed in the lecture (though acceptance of the contract is not a condition of the prize). "Philosophers historically have been interested in the frontiers of the sciences; they often have contributed to research that carefully analyzes and interprets the implications of new discoveries for both philosophy and science. With the extraordinary advances in the sciences today," said Kurtz, "it is especially important that the interrelation between science and philosophy be recognized and that philosophers should be encouraged to contribute to these advances." The 2006 Prometheus Laureate is Philip Kitcher, John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University. His current scholarly and research interests are the ethical and political constraints on scientific research, the evolution of altruism and morality, and the apparent conflict between science and religion Dr. Kitcher's Prometheus Lecture, titled "Darwin and Democracy," \s scheduled for 9-11 am, Friday, December 29, 2006, during the APA Eastern Division meeting in Washington, DC. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (Dartmouth College) will chair the session. Michael Weisberg (University of Pennsylvania) will be the commentator, with questionstofollow- ?Prometheus Books 59 John Glenn Drive / Amherst, NY 14228 / www.prometheusbooks.com</page><page sequence="56">200 I STUDIES IN ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY Series Editor: Quentin Smith, Western Michigan University REFERENCE AND ESSENCE Second Edition Nathan U.

THE KALAM COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR GOD MarkR. Nowacki 330 pp ISBN 1-59102-473-0 HC $59 This book breaks new ground by arguing that future progress on the Kalam Cosmological Argument (KCA) requires that the argument be situated within a substance-based meta physics and a modal theory sensitive to the possibilities and necessities that obtain for substances. With these conceptual tools, thought-experiments supporting the KCA can be properly assessed.

Washington, D.C. 20008 To provide sufficient interviewing space and to comply with the APA's policy on discouraging job interviews in sleeping rooms, suites will be available for rent by schools using the APA Placement Service. This year we have a sufficient number of suites available and they will be rented on a first-come, first-served basis. Each school will be limited to one suite rental. Suites are subject to a 14.5% tax per night. Check-in time is 3:00 p.m. and check-out time is noon. Deadline to cancel a guaranteed reservation without penalty is 7 days prior to arrival. For information about the suites and to receive the appropriate rental forms, please contact Linda Smallbrook at the APA National preferably through email at lindas@udel.edu, with the words "suite rental" in the subject line. If email is not an option you may call 302-831-1113. Each school renting a suite will be required to fill out a Registration For Placement Interview Form and a Suite Rental Form and return these forms in a timely manner complete with payment to Linda Smallbrook at the National Office (fax: 302-831-3372). After completion of paperwork and payment, suite confirmation numbers will be sent out in mid December. You will need a credit card to hold the suite; however, upon check-out you may pay with cash, check, or credit card. The deadline to make a reservation for a suite is December 1, 2006, although we cannot guarantee that any suites will be available at that late date.</page><page sequence="79">Hotel Diagrams 229 &gt; _J ?rf *&gt; i^KIB... ^Bf</page><page sequence="80">230 Proceedings and Addresses of the APA 80:1 ?LLIllIIJi iTsTsTiT f</page><page sequence="81">Hotel Diagrams 231</page><page sequence="82">POIESIS PHILOSOPHY ONLINE SERIALS Free access to tables of contents Digitization of hundreds of back issues Linking to other databases and electronic resources Building a research infrastructure for the future POIESIS is the largest single collection of philosophy jour nal literature in electronic format. It contains the complete content of more than 2,100 issues of dozens of peer-reviewed journals and book series?including 33,000 fully searchable articles and reviews.

POIESIS contin ues to grow, and will ultimately contain the full text of 100 journals and series from several countries. All tables of contents are freely available to anyone who registers at the site. Bibliographic citations in most indexing databases for articles or reviews in the project can be linked directly to POIESIS, and we will expand this functionality. Annual subscriptions to POIESIS are modestly priced and revenue from the project is used to fund the digitization of more print publications. Our goal is to build a research infra structure for the future that offers access to a unique collection of full-text resources.
