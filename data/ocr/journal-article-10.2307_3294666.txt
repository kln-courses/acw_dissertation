<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME DIONYSIAN REFERENCES IN THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES HIS PAPER IS an attempt to show how Plato has made deliberate use of religious materials and traditions, par- ticularly of the Dionysian strain, to en- rich and articulate his philosophical conception of the virtuous life. In this respect, Plato is at once within the movement of (a) the anthropocentrism of the sophists and (b) the religious re- forms of the tragic poets. Yet Plato dif- fers in many significant ways from both the sophists and the tragic poets. Such differences, however, indicative as they may be of the magnitude of his philo- sophic genius, lie outside the present scope. The utilization of religious materials for purposes other than worship and re- lated practices goes back to the epic rhapsodes of the Homeric and pre- Homeric period. Here the artistic imagination of the people not only wove artistic elements into the fabric of re- ligion, as is true with all cultures, but also drew extensively from the stories of the gods, their adventures and trans- actions, to enlarge the content and range of artistic creativity. Occasional- ly, as with Hesiod, the poet turns theo- logian, attempting to compile a defini- tive edition of "Who's who" in the universe of Greek religion. The impor- tant thing, however, is that the poet enjoyed the freedom to probe into the resources of religion and, when his con- cern was pious, to suggest such changes and reforms that to him seemed neces- sary to the quest of divine and human order. The Greeks even had a hero, a legendary archetype, for this sort of ac- tivity. Orpheus, for instance, is more than the poetic reformer of religious traditions. He is also the artistic mar- tyr who paid with his life for the in- novations he introduced into the Di- onysianism of Thrace. When Plato appeared on the cultural scene of Greece he had behind him the bold tra- dition of the tragic poets, to say nothing of the imaginative humanism of the philosophers. Plato, as the legend wants it, began his career as a poet, and most likely learned all this in his tender years. His early love was an art which had devel- oped out of a long series of transfor- mations of ceremonial practices within the Dionysian cult. Among the secrets upon which the success of tragic craftsmanship depended was that of</page><page sequence="2">50 JOHN P. ANTON knowing how to absorb and transform into art the cherished practices and sanctified values. When Plato turned decidedly philosophical under the di- alectical spell of Socrates, the tragic imagination was put into the service of his new art: his creation of a philosoph- ical vision as the drama of intelligence. Not least among the cultural cur- rents which Plato assimilated in his work is the vast array of religious ma- terials looming largely in the lives of the Greeks. Thus what is pertinent here is not what much of scholarship has brought under the questionable title of "Plato's theology," but Plato's explicit exploitation of religious traditions for the sake of enhancing his philosophic vision of man. In this respect, Plato was not creating some new religion out of the old; he was not a poetic or even a philosophical theologian. He was reconstructing the whole of Greek cul- ture, with the Athenian experience as its center, for the sake of restoring and attaining excellence in all its glory. Not theology, but the fundamental rele- vance of the institution of religion to the whole of the Greek cultural enter- prise, is what Plato undertook to clari- fy and assimilate.' In what follows I shall try of offer some evidence in sup- port of my thesis, with special empha- sis on selected instances of Plato's transformation of the religious materi- als of the Dionysian cult. There are many passages in the di- alogues in which Plato insists upon reforms of ritual and ceremony in line with his broader political and educa- tional philosophy, but, as Wilamowitz correctly remarked long ago, these are incidental concerns.2 The evidence per- tinent here is a cluster of Dionysian references, religious in character, in- troduced and transformed in the light of Plato's passionate reverence for Socra- tes as the best embodiment of the har- mony of virtues. These references oc- cur in connection with an occasion which is of utter significance: the eluci- dation of the problem of man's total fulfilment and education of personality, or the triumphs and failures of man- kind. With this in mind, let us turn to the Symposium,3 where every symposi- ast seems to be teaching, learning, as- piring, loving, inspiring and failing. The very event which the dialogue describes honors a tragic poet, a man in the service of Dionysos, yet the real protagonist here is the philosophi- cal man. Even the great comic poet Aristophanes, who not long ago had sat- irized Socrates in his Clouds, and is by no means sympathetic to the philoso- phers, is presented in 218b as a partici- pant of the philosophical manias te kai bakcheias,4 an intimation of the Diony- sian affinity between tragedian, come- dian, and philosopher. Before I consider the Dionysiac climax of the Symposi- um, I should mention that of the many religious strata and elements present in this work I have extracted only those that bear directly upon our theme. Let us first turn to a preparatory Dionysian reference with regard to the real hero of the dialogue, the philoso- pher. In 175e Agathon will appeal to Dionysos to judge his contest with Soc- rates as to who is knowledgeable. It is the contest between Agathon's wisdom and that of Socrates. In 193a we read that everybody fussed over Agathon's speech, whereas that of Socrates, in 212c, was received simply with praise. But where is Dionysos, the god to whom Agathon himself appealed? Dionysos did not speak through the mouth of the symposiasts, but made his judgment heard through the ecstatic and intoxi- cated Alcibiades, who declared that the philosopher is one "who in conversa- tion is the conqueror of all men, not only once, as you, Agathon, were the day before yesterday, but always." This</page><page sequence="3">SOME DIONYSIAN REFERENCES IN THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES 51 judgment is again confirmed at the end of the Symposium, where the trio of Dionysos, the three men possessed of divine madness, Socrates, Agathon, and Aristophanes, expound the art of dra- matic poetry. The philosopher alone re- mains sober and unaffected by the wine he drinks, victorious here as in matters of love. The god of intoxication gave to Socra- tes inspiration and eloquence, and his original ideas kept the two poets awake for a while; the philosopher was asking the two poets whether or not the same person could know the principles of both tragedy and comedy and is therefore the person most able to compose both. By the time Socrates brought them to agree and accept his solution, he saw that they had fallen asleep. It was a grand victory, but one in utter loneli- ness. Dawn came and he walked out alone. What happened to the solution? Plato reports that Aristodemus was un- able to recollect it when he related the story to Apollodorus.5 Plato, as we know,6 was aware of the solution, but instead of stating it here, he meant the Symposium itself to be its very em- bodiment. As a synthesis of both the tragic and the comic, it is nothing less than the terrifying drama of human ideas, the drama of life where the dying and reviving Dionysos has been re- placed by the tragic and comic sides of the philosophic man. As the symposium ends, as both dialogue and feast, a new day begins. At this junction of end and beginning, birth and death, intense con- sciousness and abandonment in stupor, one suspects that the whole of humanity is caught in the embrace of climax and anticlimax. Yet the physical scene is unadorned: Socrates readies himself to leave Agathon's house. Minutes later he will take a dip in the public baths. The episode most significant for its philosophic import and most dominant in Dionysian innuendoes is perhaps that of Alcibiades' entrance and speech. The fact that Alcibiades is both intoxicated and infatuated is too obvious to require comment. The important thing, how- ever, is that Plato withheld the dramat- ic opportunity for presenting the en- comium of Socrates until the moment Alcibiades made his appearance. The latter had the sensitivity of an inflamed Dionysian soul. It took an ecstatic man to penetrate the secrets of the Socratic daemon to see its full power, just as it takes a frenzied soul to rise to uni- fication with Dionysos. Appropriately, Alcibiades begins the encomium7 with Dionysian imagery most central to his mode of understanding Socrates. He compares him to a Dionysian deity: Socrates is like a silenus, and also like the satyr Marsyas.8 The first simile focuses attention upon the external ap- pearance of Socrates in order to ex- plain the paradox of how the unattrac- tive man is also the object of passionate love.9 Let us remember that the words of Socrates about love and beauty are still ringing in the ears of the sympo- siasts when Alcibiades, innocent of what had transpired before, offers his own speech on the theme of love in praise of the man with the seilernu.des sch.*- ma. Two antitheses dominate the opening of the speech: (a) loving the non-beau- tiful man, l and (b) returning to the specific as the object of love, in sharp contrast to the Socratic universal and absolute beauty itself. No doubt Plato could have ended the Symposium with Socrates' speech. But since he was writing philosophy and not melodrama, he allowed the event to continue in a profoundly human way by giving it a tragic turn. Just when the mind was still swimming in ecstasy, Alcibiades' entrance came to shatter the vision. The intellectual orgy of ideas reached its pinnacle of purity only to end in a comic catastrophe. The deep irony lies</page><page sequence="4">52 JOHN P. ANTON in the fact that the man of rational vi- sion is the object of love passionate and particularized. Yet this handsome youth of Athens, with the aid of two Dionysian similes, is able to glimpse in Socrates a host of deities, a universe of ideas, at once admiring and deploring them. Behind the satyr-like countenance of Socrates, Alcibiades saw ideals and val- ues, methods and meanings, compara- ble to the religious statuettes inside the carved cabinets of sculptures. Here is Socrates, a silenus containing gods. Here is also Marsyas playing songs without a flute and music more subtle and more seductive than that of the mythical Marsyas. He seduces the souls of the learned and the ignorant alike. Alcibiades knew precisely, despite his intoxication, what made Socrates at once resisting and irresistible. 1 Comparing Socrates to a deity, a sat- yr, brought into play both comic and tragic overtones. Yet in no way would the Greeks call this device irreligious or blasphemous, for the poetic mind of Greece had always indulged in divine comparisons. Plato is simply carrying the practice over to the field of phil- osophical literature. But Plato went fur- ther than that. The philosophical use of religious materials contained in Al- cibiades' speech constitutes evidence of Plato's intentional yet masterful hu- manization of the diverse strands of re- ligious traditions of the Greeks. He understood the educational value of ec- stasy, infatuation, love - the passions of the soul in general - and painlessly, as well as ingeniously, he lifted them out of their theocentric setting in order that they might fruitfully bear upon his phil- osophical conception of an anthropocen- tric vision of ethical excellence. It is significant that Alcibiades goes beyond the simple comparison of Socrates to Marsyas and a silenus; he also tells things only Socrates knew how to do, and do superbly. The mystery deity is obviously supplanted by a human per- sonality bordering on the divine. The Plato of the Symposium has now reached heights almost unsuspected in the early critique of anthropomorphic religion, as in the Euthyphro. He has advanced beyond the pre-Socratic reflec- tion, and beyond the conventionalism and scepticism of the sophists, who either denounced or advocated lip serv- ice to the objects of popular piety. Plato captured the significance of re- ligion as mythical unification and crav- ing for ideality; and he used it in order to give to his concept of man not only logical universality but also cultural in- clusiveness. Such features, not infre- quently neglected by students of Plato, are fundamental to our understanding of his philosophic vision, which invari- ably blends logical fact with ideal val- ues, and unites the structure of con- cepts to cultural aspirations. Herein, I am tempted to insist, lies the motiva- tion for the transformation of the Diony- sian tradition as well as the other religious traditions of the Greeks. Spe- cifically, the Bacchic deities are re- placed by the philosophical ideal of man: the wise man of Athens.12 The philosophers of the Hellenistic age will simply follow suit. Consider, for example, how marvel- ously, and unlike the deities, Socrates can understand and reservedly reproach the revelling yet agonized soul of Al- cibiades.13 To some it may seem odd that Plato, so exacting and demanding a thinker, should in his vision of man really want to assimilate the orgiastic outlook and substance of Dionysianism. The answer appears only after one has come to understand the richness of the Greek experience and its humanistic insight into the diverse and pluralistic nature of human activity. Plato, the poet and philosopher, brought all these elements together because he knew how relevant they are to the lives of men,</page><page sequence="5">SOME DIONYSIAN REFERENCES IN THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES 53 because he understood all our human cravings and passions just as he ad- mired and preferred man's logical, ethi- cal, and creative capacity. In this sense, Plato's Socrates is not a Western moralist, but an artistic and ethical ideal embodied in personality - man loving, understanding and educating, man doing justice to what men are and can ultimately be. Precisely because Socrates deliber- ately essays to embrace the whole na- ture of man for the coordinate blos- soming of all the dimensions of hu- man existence, is it possible for him to show affection and understanding to- ward the intoxicated and infatuated Alcibiades. He sees the latter as a man adorned with brilliance yet torn in ag- ony, craving love with the unattainable yet tortured by unbridled ambition. There is sympathy for the possibilities of his ecstatic Dionysianism, but what Socrates loved in this youth was the quality of excellence to which he could rise were he to transmute the materials of his existence with the help of intel- ligence. The fact remains that the Apol- lonian Socrates suspected his many affinities to the Dionysian Alcibiades, not least among them being an inex- haustible capacity for love and high adventure. In contrast to Socrates' knowledge of affinity of souls, his pupils, Xeno- phon, Antisthenes, and Aeschines, all so strikingly moralistic, failed to recog- nize it, let alone understand it. In fact, they never seem to have missed an op- portunity to deny it. One gathers from their works that they made a special effort to efface "that disgrace" from their teacher's memory. Again it was Plato, the master's most human and imaginative pupil, who not only re- moved the stains from this objection- able acquaintance with Socrates, but, most important, restored it to its full significance. Plato's Socrates is able to see through Alcibiades because he is at home with human nature in all its pri- mordial Bacchism and all the soul's in- eradicable passions. What emerges clearly from this philosophical portrait of Socrates is that Plato, with all his intense quest for virtue and exact knowl- edge, was far from being the senti- mental puritan or intolerant moralist many a Western scholar has labored to reconstruct. The many-sided Plato was able to work with all the traditions available to him, not least among them that of Dionysos. It therefore seems to me that when we study Plato it is as central to appreciate his sympathetic comprehensiveness as it is to master his philosophical originality. For rea- sons of this sort, Plato is still a model for understanding the factuality as well as the possibilities of the passionate side of human nature in their relevance to human achievement-what Western philosophers, many centuries later, were to call natura naturans. But why is it, one may ask, that many students of Plato's works either over- looked or failed to appreciate the deep- er currents of his religious thought? Aside from the fact that more often than not we turn him into a theologian, two other factors seem to disallow ade- quate discussion of his philosophical reforms of religious materials: (a) Religious reform to the Western mind seems to have meaning only in the light and within the scope of Chris- tian practices. In this case, reform was hardly more than a limited challenge to some tenets within the Christian faith. Differently put, the reforms were made by religious people for religious purposes where the faith itself was in no way essentially threatened. (b) Western man, despite his diverse attempts at effecting a "classical ren- aissance," never consummated a con-</page><page sequence="6">54 JOHN P. ANTON sequential ethos comparable to, or a serious and extensive social sympathy with, the anthropocentric experience of the Greek mind, which could both tol- erate and enjoy a religious pluralism and a pantheon of deities; or, what amounts to the same thing, accept a universe with gods within it. Indeed, the religious agonies and quests of the Greeks seem foreign to us, mainly, per- haps, because we find it impossible to take seriously reforms of religions di- vested of transcendental elements. Nevertheless Plato remains a reli- gious landmark in the world of the Greeks. He is much like Orpheus mi- nus the bloody end, but an Orpheus with intellectual clarity and philosophical vision. Like that legendary figure, Pla- to was at once a man with theomorphia and theomachia, yet richly endowed with harmony. JOHN P. ANTON University of Buffalo 1 Harold Cherniss, for example, has pointed out on various occasions that Plato never ac- cepted theism. Consider, on the other hand, the emphasis on Plato as a transcendental theist by R. Cushman in his Therapeia, 1957. Again, Hiram J. McLendon, in "Plato without God," The journal of religion 39 (1959) 92, writes: ". .. there is a development within his (Plato's) philosophy; that within the framework of an essentially constant philosophical apparatus he experimented with different theological positions; that these experi- ments represent a principal area of development- al change within his system; that the variant theological orientations taken by him have defi- nitely specifiable relations to one another and to the remainder of his philosophical system; that there is a kind of immanent evolution from one of his philosophical stands to the next; and that the shifts in Plato's theological doctrine, while occurring within the boundaries of a doctrinal framework that is constant, constitute the most important developmental trend within his long philosophical career." McLendon's article is a clear example of a long tradition which invented and perpetuated a theology-ridden Plato-whether with or without God is a secondary matter. The fact that it is possible to extract from the writings of Plato a strain of thought that may be called "philosophical theology" does not by ne- cessity constitute irrefutable evidence that, as McLendon insists, "the shifts in Plato's theologi- cal doctrine . . . constitute the most important developmental trend within his long philosophical career." This, at best, indicates only what the author was able to make central for his own understanding of Plato. Cf. E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the irrational (1950) 217-221. 2 Wilamowitz, Platon, I, 39, 412-13, shows that Plato had no particular interest in the diverse cults and ritual practices. Compare Phaedrus 229c, where Socrates emphatically speaks of his impatience with allegorical interpretations and rationalizations of religious stories. Also, Rep. 378d. Dodds states, however, that "the great novelty in Plato's project for religious reform was the emphasis he laid, not merely on the divinity of the sun, moon, and stars (for that was nothing new), but on their cult" (op. cit., p. 221). This cult, Dodds remarks, was designed to be a union of Apollo and Helios, the traditional- ism of the masses and the "natural religion" of the philosophers; "it is Plato's last desperate attempt to build a bridge between the intellectu- als and the people, and thereby save the unity of the Greek belief and of Greek culture" (ibid.). Dodds is correct in focusing attention on the so- cial aspects of Plato's proposal for religious re- forms touching on cult practices. The rationale behind Plato's proposal lies, if my thesis is cor- rect, in his philosophical reconstruction of the concept of man. 3 It is interesting, however, to note how Plato is able to create the illusion of historical re- moteness and to give to fact the aura of grandeur by introducing in his Symposium three chronologi- cal strata: (a) the symposium Agathon gave in the year 416; (b) the year 400 in which Apollo- dorus supposedly relates the event that tran- spired in 416; (c) the year Plato wrote the Sym- posium, i.e., around 385. 4 There is in Aristophanes' speech a deep sense of sympathy for the tragic aspects of human loneliness and erotic unhappiness. Hidden under the cloak of the comedian is the sensitive man's concern for human incompleteness and mis- fortune. Clearly, the comedian partakes of manias te kai bakcheias as much as the philosopher and the poet. Yet, as Plato sees it, the uses into which they are put differ in no small measure from case to case. Due to this difference, the philosophical man goes well beyond the capacity of the poet. 5 Apollodorus, at least, relating the story as he heard it directly from Aristodemus, gives no hint at all that Aristodemus actually remembered the "solution." 6 The solution is, to be sure, original and based on the concept of the wholeness of the philosophi- cal man. Consider, for example, Rep. 395a, Phil. 50b, the various passages in the Phaedrus, Ion 534c, and Laws 816d. 7 Beginning with ch. 32, 215a. 8 Marsyas was mainly a satyr. Under the in- fluence of satyr drama, the satyrs (Pelopon- nesian deities) and the silenes (Ionian deities) became identical; or else the old man Silenus was made the leader of the satyrs. The story of Marsyas is reported in Herodotus 7.26. Marsyas gathered the flutes which Athena invented but threw away because they distorted her face when she played them. He took to this musical instru- ment with enthusiasm and went so far as to</page><page sequence="7">SOME DIONYSIAN REFERENCES IN THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES 55 challenge in a contest the god of music, Apollo. Marsyas was defeated and skinned alive. The myth seems to reflect the antagonism between the (aristocratic) kithara as opposed to the Asiatic and sentimental (folk) flute. Alcibiades confessed that under the influence of this Mar- syas, viz. Socrates, he repeatedly felt emotions comparable to the followers of Cybele, the korubant6ontes (215e-216a). 9 Alcibiades' praise of Socrates immediately takes on a comic character, since what he ob- viously compares him to is a silenus. Yet there is a great deal of truth behind this comic com- parison; this, of course, Socrates recognizes and confirms through his silence. A. E. Taylor, how- ever, takes a different view. He writes: "On the panegyric of Socrates by Alcibiades (215a-222b) it is not necessary to dwell here. Its importance is for the understanding of the characters of Socrates and of Alcibiades, not for any contribu- tion it makes to our comprehension of the So- cratic or the Platonic philosophy" (Plato, 6th ed. [1949] 233). Perhaps Taylor is underestimating at this point the Platonic insistence on the value of philosophy as inseparable from conduct. Socrates is his philosophy no matter how successfully we may capture his philosophy in philosophical dis- course and scholarship. 10 The unattractive appearance of Socrates was often a source of jest and serious irony. See Theaet. 143e. Compare also Xenophon's Sym- posium, where Socrates calls himself a silenus- like creature. According to Alcibiades, Socrates has not only the external form of a silenus but also the inner disposition of these erotic creatures. Yet unlike the eroticism of a silenus, that of Socrates is basically directed toward wis- dom, a feature which a silenus obviously is lack- ing. For Socrates, wisdom and love are in- extricably related (hence philosophia), and though the blending of the two is well known to Alci- biades, his misfortune and failures were due to the fact that throughout his life he acted in a way that kept them separate. This type of conduct is precisely what deeply disappoints Socrates. Thus when he proposed in the presence of Socrates that he could offer erotic delight in exchange for wis- dom, he knew very well that this enterprise was doomed to failure. Alcibiades' fundamental error lies in his very supposition of the separability and distinctiveness between wisdom and love. Therefore he neither was nor could be a phil- osopher. Since the story of Alcibiades' political career was well known to Plato's contemporaries and his disciples in the Academy, one may safely conjecture that Plato made ample use of it to illustrate the disastrous consequences for social and political affairs that inevitably follow when wisdom is divorced from love. 11 Compare, however, Symp. 222c. Here Soc- rates, impressed by Alcibiades' skillful han- dling of speech and innuendo, remarks that he doubts whether the latter is indeed in a state of intoxication. N6ophein moi dokeis, 6- Alkibidde*. ou gdr dn pote hofito* komps6os kIctklo-i peri- ball6menos aphanisai enecheireis hoi hAneka tafita pdnta eire*kas. Furthermore, in Symp. 222d, he says: "You are not fooling us. Your whole satyrical and silenic drama is now perfect- ly clear. .. ." Again, Socrates is speaking in serious jest about his likeness to silenus and satyr. Incidentally, the satyr drama to which reference is made was distinguished from the tragedies in that the chorus consisted of satyrs led by Silenus. It was presented after the tragic plays. 12 Eventually, in Laws 815cd, Plato not only proceeds to describe certain mimetic bacchic dances, such as nymphs, pans, sileni and satyrs performed in connection with purifications and related rituals peri katharmofts te kai teletds tinas, but also declares them inappropriate to civic conduct, ou politik6n. Yet Plato maintained that the erotic madness is pas6?n t6?n enthousi- dseo*n ariste. (Phaedrus 249e), and it finds its culminating use not in mimetic ritual but in love of wisdom. 13Symp. 218d, 219a.</page></plain_text>
