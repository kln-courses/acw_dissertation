The study of Ancient Greek religion has undergone something of a renaissance during the past decade, thanks chiefly to the work of the distinguished Swiss Classical scholar Walter Burkert.1 Sophisticated use is now being made of an thropological theory, ethnographic data and information from Ancient Near East 1 Whose major books are now all available in English translation, the last to appear being his 'Greek Religion*, Oxford (Blackwell) 1985.</page><page sequence="2">33? /.

The study of the religions of Prehistoric Greece, those of Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece, has thus far profited little from this renaissance. Our understanding of Minoan and Mycenaean religion is still, to a very great extent, based upon the work of Martin Nilsson. His great work on cThe Minoan Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion5, 2nd ed., Lund 1950, still provides the starting-point for most discussion in the field. The main difference is that we no longer join the two with a hyphen; Minoan and Mycenaean religion are now recognized as two separate belief systems, even though the Mycenaeans do seem to have borrowed much of their cultic equipment and religious symbolism from their more advanced neighbours in Crete. The challenge for the scholar today is to get behind the outward trappings of religious practice in order to gain some understanding of religious belief. Cult paraphernalia and rooms or buildings identified as shrines can be catalogued and described, as has been done in the recent monograph by Geraldine Gesell,2 but such studies reveal very little about Minoan religion. Most of the work on Minoan religion since the days of Sir Arthur Evans has, in fact, centered around trying to determine what is and what is not a shrine and what can properly be identified as a sacred or ritual vessel. Obviously when the major scholarly debates are at the level of distinguishing between the sacred and the secular any understanding of actual religious beliefs must, of necessity, be at a very rudimentary level. In an attempt to get around this basic problem, caused chiefly by the absence of any textual evidence bearing on Minoan religion, Nann? Marinatos offers a new approach in the evaluation of the archaeological evidence. She proposes to study the frescoes from Thera, especially those from the West House and Xeste 3, within the context of the buildings whose walls they adorn. The interpretation of ancient wall decoration, both fresco and relief sculpture, through an understanding of the purpose of the building and the function of its individual rooms, has resulted in significant new evaluations of Assyrian and Achaemenid relief sculpture and the political manifesto inherent in seemingly decorative wall reliefs.3 M. seeks to extend some of this methodology from Iron Age Mesopotamia and Iran to the Bronze Age Aegean. The problem is that in the Near East we know the purpose of most of the buildings in question whereas in the Aegean that is precisely the one thing most often under discussion. In the Near East royal ideology has come to be seen as the driving force behind the grand architectural complexes excavated at Nimrud, Nineveh and Persepolis; for M. religion replaced politics in the Bronze Age Aegean. M. believes that all Theran frescoes can be shown to have what she calls ?religious iconology? and she implies that any room with fresco decoration can properly be identified as a shrine or cult room.4 In her recent study G. C. Gesell identifies no less than 138 such rooms from all of Minoan Crete, with 2 G. C. Gesell, cTown, Palace, and House Cult in Minoan Crete*, G?teborg (Paul Astr?ms F?rlag) 1985 (SIMA. 67). 3 For basic bibliography, including the work of J. E. Reade and M. C. Root, see I. J.

R. Hall published a study entitled cThe Decorative Art of Crete in the Bronze Age\ Now, eighty years later, M. concludes that ?... art in the Bronze Age could not have been decorative ...? and quotes with approval the dictum of H. Frankfort that ?the purely secular was the purely trivial? (32). The unfortunate consequence of such a position is that everything takes on a religious function. The presence of an offering table in a bathroom means that the installation was used for ritual bathing. The presence of bulbs, flour, sickles and a mill installation in what has been identified as a cult room can only be explained by the assumption that the shrine was connected with a harvest festival. Even what seems to be a bakery becomes an installation used for baking sacred bread. For M. the strong Minoan cast seen in all aspects of religion at Akrotiri is to be explained by the assumption that ?. . .Crete controlled her vassal states through religion?, forming what she calls a ?Minoan Threskeiocracy. ?7 The Minoan state (according to M.) was a theocratic state, with the economy under the control of the sanctuaries and their priests, the latter constituting the nobility of Minoan society. In form this organization is said to resemble that known in the contemporary East, in Egypt, the Levant and Mesopotamia. This reflects a growing tendency to place Minoan Crete within the context of the Ancient Near East, having little to do with the later Greek world. There are many good arguments in favor of such a position, but there are also some outstanding problems that still defy explanation. Chief among these is the lack of temples in Minoan Crete. In Egypt and Mesopotamia the theocratic state celebrated its position and power through a series of temples housing elaborate cult images that were cared for and seen only by a hieratic elite. In Egyptian the word for temple, hwt ntr, means chouse of God5, while that for the holy of holies, bw dsr or Segregated place5, is translated as ??utov in the Rosetta Stone inscription. For M. Mi noan shrines certainly had adytons which were the structures usually identified as lustral basins (14f), but the Minoans had neither temples nor cult images.9 Within the context of an essay on the Greek temple J. N. Coldstream has seen the supreme authority of the Minoan and Mycenaean rulers as providing the explanation for the lack of Bronze Age temples. He argues that: ?Absolute monarchy was the universal rule; the monarch was also high priest, and the temples* which served the official cults would be small rooms within his palaces, often tucked away in remote corners.?10 This simply cannot be correct. No ruler could have been more absolute than the Hittite king or the Egyptian pharaoh, yet both ruled surrounded by temples. Within the outer walls of Bogazk?y, ancient Hattusa, were at least 28 temples. This is not a minor problem. The absence of Minoan temples is strongly at variance with the interpretation of Minoan Crete as a theocratic state. I find it 5 G. C. Gesell, Town, Palace, and House Cult in Minoan Crete5, 68-142.

Muhly: Marinatos, Art and religion in Thera impossible to believe that Minoan priests could have controlled the economy and the foreign affairs of the state while at the same time conducting their affairs in the insignificant shrine buildings that have been identified to date. This fundamental contradiction suggests that there is something drastically wrong with the interpre tation of Minoan religion presented by M., one, it should be admitted, that is accepted by most scholars now working in the field. The fact is that rulers and priests are conspicuously absent from Minoan art, an art that, by its freshness and spontaneity, has nothing to do with the formal, stylized art of the Near Eastern palaces and temples. In comparing the religious structures at Mycenae and at Phylakopi Colin Ren frew calls attention to the fact that, at both sites, these structures are secondary to the principal, secular, buildings and that Mycenaean temples give no indication of having been at ?the centre of things?, with none of the special symbolism necessary to justify talk of theocracy5.11 The same certainly could be said of all Minoan buildings identified as religious structures. It is revealing, and probably by no means accidental that, when it comes to interpreting the subject-matter of the Theran frescoes, M. turns from the contem porary Near East to later Greek mythology. Central to her interpretations are concepts of fertility and fecundity and the representation of the coming of spring within a context presided over by a female deity depicted in her natural environ ment. The adyton from room 3 of Xeste 3 is thought to represent a female initiation ceremony, again against a background of spring symbolism. The wounded foot of the central figure in this compo sition is held to be seen in terms of blood sacrifice and later death and regeneration myths connected with Persephone and Eurydice. If this is true then no convincing explanation is offered for the representations of nude young men that seem to be part of the same composition. M. is puzzled by the fact that, while the predominant symbolism of the frescoes from Xeste 3 is one in celebration of spring, the prominent saffron crocus grows only in the late autumn (65). The already famous young priestess from one of the West House frescoes also seems to be sprinkling saffron onto the glowing coals of an incense burner held in her left hand (46). A possible clue to this puzzle may lie in the fact that the Sumerians performed their New Year's akitu festival both in spring and again in the autumn. The Hittites also performed identical festivals at both seasons of the year. Another Hittite festival, one celebrated in the spring, took its name from the ANTAH-SUM plant, now thought by some scholars to designate the saffron.12 M. believes that ?saffron can be used as a drug and is considered a pain killer during menstrua tion? (65). V. Haas goes even further, attributing hallucinogenic properties to saffron.13 To my knowledge Crocus sativus possesses none of these qualities, being used, in ancient as in modern times, in cookery and as a dye. The use of later Greek mythology, as known from writers of the Classical period, to interpret the scenes depicted in Late Bronze Age frescoes from Thera raises many interesting problems of continuity in the Aegean, continuity of people, language and religion. The close cultural ties between the inhabitants of Late Bronze Age Akrotiri and those of Minoan Crete are beyond doubt. Akrotiri is the only site outside Crete with the characteristically Minoan lustral basins or adyta 11 C. Renfrew, et al. The Archaeology of Cult. The Sanctuary at Phylakopi5.

Muhly: Marinatos, Art and religion in Thera 333 and with the pier and door arrangement or polythyra that M. also connects with religion and cult.I4 But what does the religion of Minoan Crete have to do with that of Classical Greece? M. is very much aware of the problem and states her position as follows: ?As suming then that initiation rituals of this kind are connected with the Persephone and Eurydice myths, what relationship do the latter have to the Bronze Age painting from Thera? I am not suggesting that the fresco represents either of these myths in its exact details. It is clear that there are differences as it is also clear that the myths could not have survived from the Bronze Age into the Classical period intact ... It is justifiable methodologically, however, to postulate that the original idea was a Minoan one and that it made sense in a Minoan context? (80). The culture of Minoan Crete is usually seen as having been fundamentally different from that of Mycenaean (Greek-speaking) Greece, reflecting events going back to the Indo-European invasions at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, invasions from which Crete was spared but which devastated the Greek mainland. Yet recent work at Late Minoan sites on Crete has suggested the possibility of meaningful religious and social continuity between Minoan Crete and the Greek world of Doric Crete. The most remarkable evidence comes from the site of Kato Syme-Viannou and has been discussed, in a preliminary way by A. Lembesi, the excavator of Kato Syme, in a volume dealing with the cut-out bronze plaques from that site as well as in a critical (but, alas, little-read) article in the 'Aqx0110^^1^ 5Eqrnu,?QL?;.15 This slim volume by M. is a welcome addition to a growing corpus of studies that are trying to make some sense out of the remnants of the Bronze Age Aegean world that we are fortunate enough to possess. For too long have scholars taken the attitude that what could be said with any profit about Minoan and Mycenaean religion had already been said by Martin Nilsson, for Nilsson really owes his reputation to the fact that, unlike his contemporaries, he was at least an accurate purveyor of factual information. Yet Sir Moses Finley has observed that ?Thucy dides would have learned thousands of facts about his own religion from Martin Nilsson's books, but it is to be doubted that he would have significantly altered his views about the place of religion in history as a result . . .?* It is precisely the recognition of the necessity of going beyond the ?thousands of facts? in order to grasp at the reality that sets current scholarship apart from that of Nilsson and his predecessors. Such attempts carry with them the risk of falling far short of their goal, even of spectacular failure (to which category I would assign the works of B. C. Dietrich), and there are still many scholars who prefer the security of all those facts. Others insist that Classical Archaeology, if it is to survive as a discipline having any meaning for the modern world, must venture beyond the safety of yet another catalogue, slightly more complete than all previous efforts but no closer to any understanding of the material being catalogued.

One might not agree with all her conclusions but at least she gives the reader something to think about. She even succeeds in forcing the reader to think of the Theran frescoes not as isolated examples of Bronze Age art but as paintings that once had actual meaning for those who lived within the walls of the buildings at Akrotiri.
