<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARTS OF BENIN AT UCLA Museum of Cultural History, UCLA March 2-May 1, 1983 Some acts are hard to follow. The exhibition of antiquities from Nigeria dazzled Los Angeles only a year and a half ago. Last spring, UCLA's Museum of Cultural History installed a small but evocative selection of art from Benin and its immediate neighbors in its Haines Hall gallery. "The Arts of Benin at UCLA" demonstrated the degree to which even modest examples of brass, terracotta, and wooden sculptures and regalia from the Edo can disclose a reservoir of meaning. While "Treasures of Ancient Nigeria" stressed the purely aesthetic values of masterworks, UCLA's showing was explicitly didactic. The objects were probed for their iconographic po- tential and displayed in accordance with that process. The results have been published in a handsome catalogue entitled The Art of Power, the Power of Art: Studies in Benin Iconography (see review, p. 18). A mini-symposium on March 13 amplified the research that had focussed upon objects in the exhibition and its significance to the expansion of current Benin scholarship. The project emerged from an advanced seminar given by UCLA art historian Arnold Rubin, working for an intensive two-week period with Paula Ben-Amos, Keeper of the African Collections at the University Mu- seum, University of Pennsylvania. Ben-Amos is considered the foremost American scholar on Benin art. For the catalogue, instructors and students contributed essays on such sub- jects as metal technology, detailed exegeses of individual pieces, and analyses of function and forms of object categories. Most of the content relates to the enhancement and dis- play of the hierarchy of chiefly power. Images of leopards and mudfish, birds and serpents, crocodiles and interlace patterns, and the human head and hand are analyzed as man- ifestations of different facets of power. Benin scholars have been particularly prolific since the 1970s, sifting through the considerable body of earlier ethnographical and travelers' accounts and compilations of oral traditions, enhancing and verifying that information with fieldwork. It is material, in Rubin's view, that may well provide an armature about which an art history of southern Nigeria can be developed. Exhibition designer George Johnson's dis- play techniques and groupings facilitated comparisons between related pieces. A clev- erly disposed transparent divider in the cen- ter of the gallery permitted viewing some of the altarpieces in conjunction with a continu- ous slide projection. However, the all too familiar obscurity tended to efface significant details, and red illuminated cases established a somewhat theatrical ambience. Labels, al- 76</page><page sequence="2">though generally informative, excluded even provisional dating. The slides, intended to provide relevant historical and contextual in- formation, lacked specific identification that would have been helpful to a viewer less familiar with the subject. A richly carved and patinaed tusk from UCLA's Wellcome collection was a focal ob- ject. Barbara Blackmun has utilized her recent computerized studies of subject clusters on a corpus of 101 Benin tusks in a detailed in- terpretation of this piece. She identifies the subject of the tusk as a commemoration of the 16th-century Oba Esigie and his dealings with Europeans, with references to his mother, Idia, who taught her son occult and practical skills. It originated from the royal carvers' guild at a later undetermined date. In Black- mun's words an "icon and instrument of statecraft," the tusk embodies references to historic events, political figures, occult lore, and social sanctions. Three adjacent altar heads - one in wood, one in terracotta, and one in brass - demon- strated different styles and functions deter- mined by the different media. For example, terracotta was once the dominant material used in commemorative heads on royal altars; now it is found only in the brasscasters' ward. Wooden carvings were usually designated for chiefs' shrines, while brass (or, more accu- rately, copper alloy) was restricted to royalty. Materials occupied clearly defined ranks in the Benin hierarchy of values. Heads not only were commemorative, as once thought, but could also represent sacrifice by decapitation or be used as objects of worship or propitia- tion. Iron embodied both positive and negative forces. Ritual objects in forged iron in the exhibition included miniature tools assem- bled as shrine objects, bird-topped staffs, and ceremonial swords. Iron was associated with a "hot" deity, Ogun, who is both dangerous and powerful. As patron to iron forgers, he was propitiated before work began. The mini- ature tools were used on the smith's shrine. Although Ogun's powers were related to de- structive weaponry, they were also associated with the healing properties of herbs. Among the Yoruba, Ogun was believed to dear the way for the gathering of medicines in the bush. The staffs were particularly identified with Osun, whose "cooler" nature as master of herbs and healing was symbolized by winged creatures like birds and witches. One essay in the catalogue traces the history and significance of iron usage, and another the technology of metal-casting in Benin. In the latter, Timothy Garrard has applied his exper- tise in Akan brass-casting to Benin cast met- als. The display included a failed casting of a head from the UCLA collection. It demon- strated the technical difficulties encountered in using the traditional lost-wax method for large objects, difficulties expounded in detail in Garrard's essay. The most refined of the cast objects shown, three brass belt-masks, accompanied a pair of D-shaped pendent plaques. All were worn as emblems of respect and loyalty to the Oba. The two anthropomorphic belt-masks from the UCLA collection incorporated animal elements. One had a traditional coral-bead headdress and a neck ringed with coiled mud- fish, a type suggesting an 18th-century date, according to William Fagg; the second bore crouching frogs on the cheeks and forehead, creatures symbolizing the liminal but bridging powers of Osun. Frogs also ap- peared at the feet of two attendant figures on one of the plaques, suggesting another con- nection with the Osun cult. Animal sym- bolism was one of the principal lines of re- search pursued in the reinterpretation of the exhibited works. An anthropomorphic mask with frogs incorporated other symbolic refer- ences to sacrificial death. Human legs pro- truding from the jaw usually signify Ofoe, messenger of death; cylindrical pegs emerg- ing from the top and bottom of this piece may allude to the display of human sacrifices im- paled on a post or spike; a pointed object held between the lips was identified as a celt, which can also refer to the god of death, Ogiuwu. The third brass belt-mask, in the shape of a leopard's head, was from the Fine Arts Muse- ums of San Francisco. It resembled that repre- sented on a free-standing figure of Iyase of Odu from the Vincent Price collection. As a principal war chief of this sector outside Benin City, he wore the mask above his left hip. The relation between the Oba, King of the Palace, and the leopard, King of the Bush, was dis- iT , 'I mI AW-' r ML71 MAW. poo 77</page><page sequence="3">cussed by Ben-Amos in her paper delivered at the mini-symposium. The leopard shared with the Oba the prerogative to kill. The en- larged, almond-shaped eyes remind that his gaze had the power of death. When the war- rior wore charms of leopard claws and teeth, he killed in the name of the Oba. The connections between the mudfish and the Oba are more problematic, but were amplified in the catalogue and exhibition. The mudfish is generally thought to represent the peace and prosperity of the Oba's rule; it is associated with the watery realm of Olokun, of whom the Oba is the earthly counterpart. One species of mudfish is capable of deliver- ing a deadly electric shock, however. Blackmun has suggested that this attribute of charged power which restricts the Oba's con- tact with the earth is alluded to in the motif of the fish-legged king. Three finely carved rectangular wooden stools, dating from this century but taking their forms from much older prototypes, bore an elaborate system of symbols. One was decorated with abstract patterns of interlace and rosettes. Another, identical in form, was inset with mirrors (representing prestigious imports) and displayed figures of an Oba and his attendants, references to human sacrifices necessary to a stable reign, and repre- sentations of powerful Europeans who have come to offer homage. A third stool was ex- pressive of the fear of the violence associated with kings and leopards. Ben-Amos identifies the principal figure carved upon the seat as the early 16th-century Oba Azolua, an infa- mous warmaker, who was celebrated with the praise name "the leopard cub with strong claws." Images of powerful magic, of merci- less decapitation, of a ritual priest with lips curiously elongated who was associated with cannibalism and witchcraft, and heads of Osun and Ofoe, deities of healing and death, reinforced the message of an absolute and vic- torious monarchy sanctioned by material and supernatural force. One of the values of exhibitions like "The Arts of Benin at UCLA" is the impetus they provide to further research. The clearer defi- nition, by means of art forms, of intergroup relationships in southern Nigeria demands systematic investigation. For example, altars to the power of the hand suggest parallels with Ibo Ikenga shrines, which like the Benin examples embody the strength and capabilities of the successful man. The Benin ancestral rattle-staff is the ideological com- plement of the altar; both signify the indi- vidual's achievement and potential. The carved wooden altars serve as cylindrical bases for tusks or horns, customarily repre- sented on Ibo Ikenga. The vertical member is expressive of the energy of male aggression, as referred to in such Ibo proverbs as "... may your Ikenga stand straight, may you be a killer of enemies." Ancestral staffs are also made to denote powerful male indi- viduals by peoples in surrounding regions, such as the Ibibio, Ijaw, Isoko, and Urhobo. The wooden staffs exhibited, like the altars, are known to be also cast in brass. As such they are exclusively possessions of the Oba. "The Arts of Benin" was another in a con- tinuing series of didactic exhibitions based on segments of the formidable UCLA collections, and its catalogue was number 19 in the monograph series based on the materials. UCLA continues to provide unique and valu- able events in a city where serious showings of African art unfortunately are rare. Dolores M.
