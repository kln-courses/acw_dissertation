<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALEJANDRO CASONA AND THE DEVIL CHARLES H. LEIGHTON' University of New Hampshire In recent years Alejandro Casona's pre- occupation with illusion has been the sub- ject of several articles, the consensus of which may be represented by the follow- ing statement from one of them: Man is confronted on every hand by the desire to escape from one thing or another-to sub- stitute illusion for reality. But we can only reach the conclusion that the author [Casona] feels that there is no escape other than to face reality.1 Since the illusions (and delusions) dealt with in the majority of Casona's plays are manifestly those of the characters, this conclusion is generally valid. There are, however, some fantastic elements in this author's works that cannot be so categor- ized and that, consequently, merit further consideration. The latter elements are more in the nature of persistent fantasies on the part of the author. In what follows here, I propose to deal with one of them: the Devil.2 The Devil has always fascinated Ca- sona. At least as early as 1926 he mani- fested great interest in Lucifer. That year as the topic for his thesis at the Escuela Superior del Magisterio he chose El diablo en la literatura y en el arte. Two years later he wrote Otra vez el Diablo, a play of diabolical intervention. Twice again he returned to the theme: in a play, La barca sin pescador, in 1945 and an article, "Don Juan y el Diablo," in 1955. This interest in the Devil is not unusual. He shares it with many of his contemporaries, perhaps the most illustrious of whom are Denis de Rougemont, a Protestant, and Giovanni Papini, a Catholic.3 Indeed at the present time there are at least three quite distinct schools of thought with respect to the Devil. The essential bone of contention among them all is the mode of existence of the Devil. There is, first of all, the traditional school: those Catholics and Protestants who attribute to the Devil a real existence apart from the evil which exists in the world. They derive their thought ultimate- ly from the Bible where the Devil is iden- tified as Lucifer. Once the Prince of Light and the most perfect of the angels, he was led through his pride to utter his classic "non serviam," to revolt against God and thereby incur His wrath. For his insolence he was cast into Hell where he continued his subversive activities. While at first he had no attributes other than those of an archangel, albeit a perverted one, early in the fourteenth century he acquired pre- cise anthropomorphic and zoomorphic attri- butes. He began also to play a much more active role. His teaching ceased to be merely erroneous and became actively harmful. He is henceforth the implacable enemy of both God and man, exclusively occupied in misleading the latter into the perversion or denial of his Faith. Hell underwent a similar metamorphosis, be- coming equipped with a topography, di- mensions, structure, flora, fauna, and climate." These notions of the nature of the Devil and his domain have persisted to the present with little change. Although the Catholic Church does not really sanc- tion them, preferring to look upon the Devil as an evil spirit, fundamentalists of all sects adhere to the traditional anthro- pomorphic and zoomorphic beliefs. The second school of thought now in favor conceives of itself as enlightened. It is composed of those rationalists who look upon the Devil as nothing more than a 29</page><page sequence="2">30 HISPANIA convenient myth.5 They hold that the Devil has no real existence-he is nothing more nor less than a useful label for the evil which abounds in the world. The Devil is thus only an allegorical figure. Such thought, while close to the original position of Christianity, is now manifestly heretical. It leads inevitably to the opti- mistic belief in man's power to transcend evil and hence to destroy the Devil. All that is needed in the eyes of such rational- ists is the use of the intelligence. The final school is comprised by those characterized sometimes as irrationalists and sometimes as anti-intellectualists."' They are the exponents of unconscious psychology, the spiritual heirs of Sigmund Freud. Their position is this: The Devil is an allegorical figure, yet not in the same sense that he is one for the rationalists. He personifies not only the conscious, manifest evil found in the world but also the unconscious latent evil which lurks within each one of us.7 This latter evil is difficult of identification, assuming all manner of disguises. Indeed the presence of the "Devil" in this sense is very hard to detect and the remark of Baudelaire that "The Devil's neatest trick is to per- suade us that he does not exist"" suggests itself at once in this connection. The rela- tively small number of adherents to this last school of thought are guilty of no such optimism as that of the rationalists. Indeed they are close to the traditional Christian point of view in that they regard life as an endless dialectic between the forces of good and those of evil." The thought of Erich Fromm, especially that found in Escape from Freedom, is typical of this group at its most optimistic."', Let us now see how Casona conceives of the Devil in his two plays containing a diabolical theme. The argument of the first, Otra vez el Diablo (a title which humorously suggests the same thing as Amphitryon 38-the persistence of a myth with all its irreducible ambiguities) is as follows: a delightful young princess, who when younger reenacted the story of Red Riding Hood and became lost while look- ing for the wolf, now a beautiful young lady, sets out again in search of adven- ture.'1 In a wood she meets a handsome young student equally avid for excitement. He has just held counsel with the Devil and has rejected the latter's seemingly disinterested offer of earthly happiness. The princess is disillusioned to learn that the student is neither poet nor bandit. He, for his part, is fascinated with her. When the Princess leaves, the Devil reappears and promises the student his aid in se- ducing her. In order to fulfill this promise the Devil goes to the palace and succeeds in obtain- ing the post of tutor to the Princess. At this time a series of ills-pestilence, revo- lution, war-beset the kingdom. The Devil informs the Princess that the only way that these terrible evils can be remedied is through the death of the Devil. This, in turn, can be effected only through the use of the Devil's own dagger which the student now possesses. The latter has of late become the leader of a curious lot of bandits. They seem rather more a group of intellectual outcasts. After promising her hand to whoever succeeds in killing the Devil, the Princess sets out for El Gallo Blanco, an inn serving at present as a refuge for the student and his raffish band. On meeting her again, the student is again smitten, and promises to kill the Devil. However, his good intentions are all but forgotten when he partakes of a magical potion foisted upon him by the Prince of Darkness. Seized at once with an uncontrollable desire to violate the young maid, he barely manages to avert acceding to it. First he bids her leave at once. When she refuses he appeals to her servant, Cascabel, requesting that the latter bind his hands. Cascabel, a sort of gracioso, does so happily. The student- bandit then bids Cascabel to go and in-</page><page sequence="3">CASONA AND THE DEVIL 31 form the Princess' father, the King, of the danger she is in. This too he does. After a few moments of darkness on stage, the dawn arrives and with it the King and his soldiers. When they attempt to apprehend him, the student, his hands unbound a few minutes earlier by the Princess, assures them that during the night he has killed the Devil. In proof of his assertion he produces the diabolical weapon dripping with blood. The action ends as befits a comedia with the marriage of the two young people. The action of Otra vez el Diablo takes place in a fairy tale setting, an environ- ment devoid of spatial or temporal pre- cision. It is suggested vaguely that the country in question lies between Spain and Germany and that the time is the seventeenth century. The main figures are unmistakably symbolical: He, She, and the Devil. Casona's Devil is quite interesting yet quite orthodox. On the occasion of his first appearance he shocks the student by an assertion that like him he too is a Roman Catholic. In spite of the humor the state- ment is valid: it is a Roman Catholic Devil with which we have to do here-one which is theologically accurate. He is a rather pathetic creature trying to disprove the allegations of Catholic philosophers and theologians. He says at one point: Diablo.-Escucha. Yo tengo muy mala fama; la gente cree que no sirvo mas que para enredar; los fil6sofos me consideran como una negaci6n, y los te6logos sostienen que no podrd hacer el bien aunque quiera. Y eso si que no. Yo tengo que darles un mentis a esos charlatanes. (Com- prendes? Tengo que hacer un bien antes de jubilarme. Pero un bien diab61ico ..., con intriga y tentaci6n (Obras completas, I, p. 205). And at another point he aggrandizes him- self by insisting that all Christians, even the saints, owe him a debt for without his efforts they would not have attained saint- hood. Diablo.-Ya s6, ya. Tambien los santos se han portado bastante mal conmigo. Y, sin embargo, si no hubiera sido yo, no hubieran sido ellos. iLo que yo trabaje por su santidad, privindome del suefio, tentindoles sin descanso y en horas extraordinarias, a veces hasta las cuatro y las cinco de la madrugada! Pero los pobres . . . yo creo que ni siquiera me entendieron. No supieron comprender que en la historia del cielo ellos eran el capital y yo el trabajo. S61o una excepci6n tengo que hacer: Teresa de Avila (Obras completas, I, p. 204). It is arresting to note that Casona's Devil adduces in his own favor arguments almost exactly similar to those which Pa- pini used to justify the Devil's existence in his extremely controversial The Devil.12 Casona, however, has had the wisdom to put such diabolical arguments where they belong-in the mouth of the Devil. Returning to the play, the reference to Saint Teresa of Avila is quite revealing. Writing recently in Cuadernos del Con- greso por la Libertad de la Cultura, Ca- sona referred again to the Saint of Avila in this connection. "Nos dej6 esta frase certera," he says, "por donde asoma la ternura de su teologia femenina: iPobre Satin, que no ama!"' "13 Here then is the tragedy of the Devil-he cannot love and he cannot do good. In the same article Casona expressed in a rather straightfor- ward way what he merely insinuates ironically in Otra vez el Diablo: the Devil is more to be pitied than feared. He said: Al ser derribado del cielo, Luzbel conserv6 uno solo de sus dones angelicos: el de la Sabi- duria; pero una sabiduria negra, hecha de astucia y de magia exterior. Para realizar el Mal no encontr6 mejor expediente que en- gafiar al hombre con la apariencia del Bien; por eso sus tentaciones son siempre una oferta de aparentes bienes debajo de los cuales se esconde la esencia misma del mal. Ofrece el placer, la sabidurfa, la juventud, la riqueza o el amor. Pero detris de ese placer estai el hastio, detris de su ciencia pesimista esti la desilusi6n; su amor y su riqueza son oro falso de alquimia, ue al tocarlo, se convierte en plomo, y detris e su juventud ficticia espera la mueca fn'a de la muerte. Tertuliano encontr6 la definici6n exacta al Ilamar al Diablo "el mono de Dios." Es decir, el mal imitador, la falsificaci6n y la caricatura. Dios hace milagros, y el Diablo quiere fingir ese poder; pero en buena teologia lo ainico que le estai permitido hacer son falsificaciones y caricaturas de milagros, trucos de magia y de prestidigitaci6n. Porque el milagro supone una</page><page sequence="4">32 HISPANIA alteraci6n de las leyes de la Naturaleza, y el Diablo no puede alterar esas leyes, sino sola- mente su apariencia; como en la pretendida juventud de Fausto, que no fue un biol6gico volver atris, sino un simple truco de cirugia estetica. Fausto recobra su "apariencia juvenil," pero debajo de su nueva piel de galin no hace mas que llevar escondido el cadaver del viejo doctor pesimista.14 Satan in Otra vez el Diablo is a witty deceiver who blends truth and falsehood so cleverly that it is difficult to avoid being gulled by him. Apropos of his depiction by writers and painters he points out their exaggerations: Estudiante.-Por cierto que lo del rabo ?D6nde lo escondes? Diablo.-Pero, sefor, icuaindo acabardis los hombres de decir tonterias? Estudiante.-JTambien es mentira lo del rabo? Diablo.-Una solemne mentira. Casi todas vuestras mentiras son solemnes. Esta la in- ventaron los pintores, gente, por lo general, soez y mal educada (Obras completas, I, p. 203). It seems quite clear that Casona accepts the reality of the Devil but rejects the zoomorphic features attributed to him by medieval theologians. It seems undeniable, too, that he rejects the traditional ugliness of the Devil. This can be seen from the scene where his Satan rather vainly asks the student for an opinion regarding his appearance: Diablo.- Pues ya me has conocido. Ahora, con sinceridad, ?que te parezco? Estudiante.-No estai mal. Yo crei que eras todavia mais feo. Diablo (Picado.)-iMais feo! Si, claro, te habrain contado perrerias. La gente no sabe mais que fastidiar al pr6jimo. Ademois, lo reconozco, estoy algo pasado, he engordado . . . i Si me hubieras conocido en mis tiempos! (Obras com- pletas, I, p. 201). The ending of the play suggests that the Devil is equivalent to Sin, and that he can be killed by a simple conscious effort on the part of each of us. This would seem to place Casona close to the position of the rationalists. Yet such an assump- tion does not appear to be justified by the treatment accorded the Devil in the article alluded to nor by that to which he is sub- ject in La barca sin pescador. In La barca sin pescador Ricardo Jordan, an unscrupulous young financier and ap- parently an American, finds himself on the verge of being ruined. The Devil ap- pears at precisely the right moment and offers Ricardo the chance to recoup. All he need do is agree to will a death, that of a Scandinavian fisherman whom he does not even know. After some hesitation Ricardo agrees. The Devil permits him to hear the abrupt termination of his vic- tim's joyful song as he plunges to his death from a cliff and the scream of a woman who has witnessed the event. Ricardo immediately begins to feel an un- wonted emotion-remorse. For the first time in his life his blood begins to thaw. Despite the miraculous bouleversement on the stock market which restores his for- tune he remains unhappy. Two years later and apparently after a prolonged search Ricardo finds Estela, the widow of his victim, Peter Anderson. She is living with her aged grandmother trying to keep up the household all by herself. Ricardo spends two weeks with the two women and begins, quite literally, a new life. On the last day, just before his ship is to leave, Ricardo makes an effort to confess his crime but before he can do so Estela tells him that she saw the murder and recognized the murderer as her brother- in-law Cristian. Before Ricardo has a chance to say anything, Frida, Cristian's wife, bursts in with the news that her husband has been gravely wounded and wishes to see Estela. Estela leaves uneasily, feeling that she can never give Cristian the pardon he is apparently seeking. Once she is gone the Devil appears to Ricardo to remind him of his bargain. But Ricardo has realized that the Devil did not per- form any miracle, that, indeed, all he did was to take advantage of events to pro- vide the appearance of a miracle. When the Devil reminds him that in any case he has made a bargain, Ricardo argues that he has not succeeded in fulfilling his part; he has not willed the death of a</page><page sequence="5">CASONA AND THE DEVIL 33 man. Thereupon he confounds the Devil by stating that he will fulfill the contract by killing the old Ricardo Jordin, a pro- cess which he has already begun. The Deceiver, deceived, has no recourse but to concede defeat. Ricardo now is free to remain in the little village and pay court to Estela, whose love has made possible this regeneration. Once again in this play Casona has created an intriguing, witty Devil. He ap- pears dressed in a cutaway coat and carry- ing a briefcase looking every inch the successful denizen of Wall Street. Ricardo argues like a rationalist against the possi- bility of his appearance and the Devil par- ries with a series of replies which merit quoting: Ricardo.-iPero se da cuenta de lo absurdo de esta situaci6n? Usted no puede estar ahi, aunque lo crea. El diablo no es un personaje de carne y hueso. Es una idea abstracta. Caballero.-Y sin embargo, aqui me tienes. De vez en cuando, hasta las ideas abstractas necesitamos salir a estirar las piernas. Ricardo.-No puede ser. Una aparicion en estos tiempos . .. . i Y con esa facha! Caballero (ofendido, mircindose).-?Facha? Ricardo.-Perd6n; quiero decir, con .ese as- pecto provinciano, de pequefio burgues. Caballero.-Te dire; en realidad hay tres dia- blos distintos seguin la jerarquia de las almas. Hay uno aristocritico y sutil, para tentar a los reyes y a los santos. Hay otro,, apasionado y popular, para uso de los poetas, y los campesinos. Yo soy el diablo de la clase media. Ricardo.-Ahora me explico el chaquet; y hasta la carpeta de negocios. ?No le parece demasiada naturalidad? Caballero.-La naturalidad siempre estai bien. Incluso para lo sobrenatural. Con permiso. (Se sienta tranquilamente y se sirve un vaso.) Ricardo.-Ea, basta de bromas estuipidas. O usted se retira ahora mismo o hare que lo pongan en la calle (Obras completas, I, pp. 619-620). But Ricardo soon finds that he can do nothing; the buzzer, the telephone, even the clock are not functioning. He is sus- pended for a moment in eternity. In the conversation which follows we learn much about Ricardo Jordin's humble beginnings and his subsequent rise to success over the bodies of others. In the course of this successful rise he has com- mitted every crime except premeditated murder. Part of the conversation provides us with a wonderful insight into Casona's ideas about the Devil: Ricardo (inquieto, levantandose).-?Es un crimen lo que vienes a proponerme? Caballero.-Exactamente; lo uinico que falta en tu lista. Atrevete a completarla, y yo volvere a tus manos las riendas del poder y del dinero, que acabas de perder. Ricardo.-No, gracias. Habre Ilegado muy bajo, no lo niego. Pero un crimen es demasiado. Caballero.-iTan seguro estais de no haber cometido ninguno? Hay crimenes sin sangre, que no estain en el C6digo. Ricardo.-iPor ejemplo? Caballero.-Por ejemplo . .. (Consulta nueva- mente la ficha.) Cuando eras nifio pobre ronda- bas los muelles buscando plitanos podridos para saciar tu hambre. Treinta afios despues hacias arrojar al mar centenares de vagones, para hacer subir los precios. .C6mo liamarian a eso los nifios hambrientos que siguen rondando los muelles? Ricardo.-No puedo detenerme en sentimen- talismos. El coraz6n es un mal negocio. Caballero.-De acuerdo. Entonces dejemos los sentimientos y vamos a los nuimeros, que es tu fuerte. (Vuelve a consultar la ficha.) En tu empresa trabajan tres mil hombres respirando los gases de las minas y el humo de las fibricas. Seguin las estadisticas todos ellos mueren cinco afios antes de lo normal. Tres mil hombres a cinco afios, son ciento cuarenta siglos de vida truncada. iLinda cifra, eh! La historia del mundo no tiene tanto. Ricardo.-Tampoco de eso es mia la culpa. Yo no inventd el sistema. Caballero.-Pero vives de d1 c6modamente. Y todo esto sin contar a los que tosen en plena juventud gracias a ti; y a los que engendran hijos raquiticos gracias a ti; y a los viejos pre- maturos, ya los inutilados . . . Ricardo.- iTenemos los mejores hospitales del pais! Caballero.-Lo de siempre: primero fabriciis los enfermos y despues los hospitales. Ricardo.-Entendaimonos. (Has venido a perder mi alma o a darme una lecci6n de moral? Caballero.-Nunca he sabido hacer lo uno sin lo otro. Ricardo.-Vergiienza debiera darte. Si en vez de un predicador trasnochado fueras un diablo serio, estarias orgulloso de mi. Caballero.-f Y quig n dice que no? Desde mi punto de vista todo lo que has hecho hasta ahora es perfecto. Ricardo.-iAh! Pero de esos males de que me acusas, no soy el responsable yo s6lo. Somos muchos. i Todos! Caballero.-En eso no te falta raz6n. Para emplear tu lenguaje yo dinra que son . . . "crimenes an6nimos, de responsabilidad limi-</page><page sequence="6">34 HISPANIA tada" (Obras completas, I, pp. 622-624). It will be seen at once that Casona again plays with some of the traditional ideas concerning the Devil. Satan here is well acquainted with the device so dear to Baroque dramatists of "engafiar con la verdad." He admits jocosely that he has never been able to ruin souls without playing the role of night-hawk preacher. While this is quite true, it is a role forced upon him by those who would redeem him. Once the pact is signed and the Devil departed, Ricardo tries to verify what he has witnessed. He calls his servant Juan and asks him to call back the visitor, but Juan has seen no one. Juan, looking for a rational explanation, assumes that his master has had an hallucination as a con- sequence of protracted insomnia and the effects of alcohol. But the relief is only momentary for Juan comes upon a black glove which the Devil has carelessly left behind: Ricardo (nuevo sobresalto. Tira el cigarrillo). -iUn guante negro? (Lo toma y lo mira fija- mente.) iExacto! Por fin un rastro de realidad. ?Qu` me dices ahora? Cuando tri suefias con un irbol de manzanas, no te encuentras una manzana al despertar, verdad? Juan.-No es lo corriente. Ricardo.-Pues aqui esti la manzana. Si este guante que vemos los dos es verdad, quiere decir que tambien fue verdad la mano . . . y el hombre de la mano (Obras completas, I, p. 630). Ricardo decides that the most prudent thing to do is to try to forget the whole matter, for any attempt to explain it to others will be met with misunderstanding and disbelief. As we have noted, in this modern age the Devil as a living figure does not exist for the majority of edu- cated people. As an abstract idea of evil, yes; or as an illusion, perhaps; but cer- tainly not in human form, and in a form so current. He is, as we have seen, ac- cepted by "rational and free" minds as a myth, as a contrived figure used for liter-. ary purposes to express Evil, or as an un- conscious projection of the evil inherent in each of us. Why, then, does Casona present him in this fashion? Why does he have him leave the black glove as tangible evidence, a concrete artifact which cannot be ex- plained away? Would it not have been to the author's advantage to leave the ques- tion of the mode of existence of the Devil open, in order to keep his audience pon- dering this ethical point? Certainly it would have given more philosophical depth to the drama. But no, Casona wants to leave no doubt in anyone's mind as to the reality of his Devil. The only con- clusion to be drawn from this rejection of modern rational thought must be that, for Casona at least, the Devil is very much alive, and very much in evidence. Perhaps the author, ever the pedagogue, is trying to point out this fact to his audiences, to rouse them from their lethargic attitude toward evil.15 As has been noted above, Baudelaire believed that the Devil desires to have people believe he doesn't exist be- cause it makes it easier for him to achieve his purposes. It may be that in his lifetime Casona has seen ample proof of the Devil's working thus in and through unbelieving people and that he wishes to convince such skeptics of the Devil's reality in this world by the only evidence they will ac- cept-tangible evidence." In this play, then, Casona regards the Devil as really existing, as multiform, clever, and witty, He also regards him as pathetic. He him- self admits that he is incapable of miracles. He does so in his final appearance: Caballero.-Ya te dije que se trataba de un experimento. Y hasta ahora no me ha salido del todo mal. Ricardo.-No me importan tus experimentos. Lo Uinico que esti claro es que yo no mat&amp;. Todo fue obra tuya. Caballero.-iMia? El que puede disponer de la vida y de la muerte, no soy yo. Es . . el Otro (Sefiala vagamente). Esto lo saben hasta los chicos de las aldeas. Solamente los que habeis leido muchos libros Ilegaiis a olvidar las cosas mis sencillas. Ricardo.- Quien lo mat6, entonces? Caballero.-?No lo sabes ya? Cristian. S61o Cristiain.</page><page sequence="7">CASONA AND THE DEVIL 35 Ricardo.-4Y si tdi mismo lo confiesas, que vienes a buscar ahora? Yo estoy libre de culpa. Caballero.-Ahi es donde te equivocas. No has matado, de acuerdo. Pero has querido matar. Y para mi nsa es la verdad que vale. Tambien te dije aquel dia que el hecho material no me importaba. Mi finico mundo es el de la voluntad (Obras completas, I, pp. 684-685). Outwitted by Ricardo and undone by the love the latter has come to feel for Estela, the Devil makes one last request of him: Caballero.-Me lo temia. El amor . .. Siempre se me olvida ese pequefio detalle, y siempre es el que me hace perder. Ricardo.-eQue esperas ahora? Caballero.-Nada . . . Ahora, todo lo que intentara contra ti ya seria infitil.

Vine a perder tu alma, y yo mismo te he puesto sin querer en el camino de la salvaci6n. iEs para jubilarse de una vez! (Va lentamente hacia la puerta del huerto. Se detiene.) ?Puedo pedirte un favor . . . de amigo a amigo? Ricardo.-Di. Caballero.-No le cuentes a nadie lo que ha pasado entre nosotros.

Anderson . . . (Sale.) (Obras completas, I, pp. 688-689). "Pobre diablo," Santa Teresa's words are here put in the mouth of Ricardo. Can there be any doubt that they express Ca- sona's attitude too?.l NOTES 1 A.

" See Crane Brinton, The Shaping of the Modern Mind (New York, 1953), pp. 223-226. 7 "In a psychological study we must start from the assumption that the Devil is a creation not of heaven, as the theologians still teach, but of the human mind. As Graf says: 'Er wurde nicht vom Himmel herabgestiirzt, sondern erhob sich aus den Abgriinden der menschlichen Seele.' ('He was not cast down from heaven, but arose out of the depths of the human soul.') And that these depths, when fully explored, will be found to be definitely susceptible of comprehension there can be little doubt. Freud writes: 'Der Teufel ist doch gewiss nichts anderes als die Personifikation des verdringten unbewussten Trieblebens' ('For the Devil is certainly nothing else' than the personification of the repressed, unconscious instinctual life'), and Silberer adds: 'Der Teufel und die finsteren dimonischen Gestalten der Mythen sind, psy- chologisch genommen, funktionale Symbole, Personifikationen des unterdriickten, nicht sublimierten elementaren Trieblebens.' ('The Devil and the sombre daemonic figures of the myths are-psychologically regarded-functional symbols, personifications of the suppressed and unsublimated elements of the instinctual life.')."

The origi- nal quotation occurs in "Le joueur genereux" (poeme xxIx), a version of the Faust theme. The Devil, speaking with Baudelaire, informs him that he has experienced fear but once.

See Charles Baudelaire, Petits podmes en prose (Le spleen de Paris), ed. Henri Lemaitre (Paris, 1958), p. 141. 9 Freud conceived of individual human life in terms of a struggle between two biological in- stincts, eros and thanatos, in which the latter eventually triumphed. To the devious workings of this death instinct he also attributed all of the ills, physical as well as mental, to which man is subject. See Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle (New York, 1950) and Karl A. Men- ninger, Man Against Himself (New York, 1950). Freud later applied this theory to the life of societies. He was rather pessimistic about the possibility of dealing successfully with the ills of a society. He asks rather dubiously "And with regard to any therapeutic application of our knowledge, what would be the use of the most acute analysis of social neuroses, since no one possesses power to compel the com- munity to adopt the therapy?" Freud, Civiliza- tion and Its Discontents, trans. Joan Riviere (London, 1951), p. 142. For a detailed inter- pretation of Occidental History based on Freud's theory see Norman O. Brown, Life Against Death (New York, 1959). Brown appears to be somewhat more optimistic than Freud. 10 See Erich Fromm, Escape From Freedom, (New York and Toronto, 1941), chapter v, "Mechanisms of Escape," pp. 136-206. Fromm rejects Freud's biological determinism. He holds that "the drive for life and the drive for des- truction are not mutually independent factors but are in a reversed interdependence. The more the drive toward life is thwarted, the stronger is the drive toward destruction; the more life is realized, the less is the strength of destructiveness. Destructiveness is the outcome of unlived life. Those individual and social conditions that make for the suppression of life produce the passion for destruction that forms, so to speak, the reservoir from which the particular hostile tendencies-either against others or against oneself-are nourished." (op. cit., p. 184.) Fromm believes that these con- ditions can be corrected. 11 The play may be read in Casona, Obras completas, I, ed. Federico Carlos Sainz de Robles (Mexico, etc., 1954), pp. 189-275. Sub- sequent references to Casona's plays will be to this edition and will be made in the text. 12 Papini, op. cit., p. 203. 13 "Don Juan y el Diablo: Las dos negaciones del amor," Cuadernos del Congreso por la Libertad de la Cultura (Paris), num. 16 (enero- febrero, 1956), p. 70. This essay had pre- viously appeared in El Universal (Caracas), October 19, 1955, p. 4. 14 Ibid., p. 69. 15 Casona's parents were both teachers and he began his career as a teacher. It is not sur- prising therefore that his theater has a marked- ly pedagogical bent. See Juan R. Castellano, "Doctrinas pedag6gicas de Alejandro Casona," Hispania, XLIII (1960), 25-29. It should be noted, moreover, that Casona's pedagogy, like that of the Baroque playwrights, has a dual purpose, that of deleitar aprovechando. 16 For some of the ideas contained in this par- agraph I am indebted to Miss Dorothea J. Vlahakos. They were developed in the course of our work on her thesis, "Fantasy and the Fantastic in Selected Works of Alejandro Casona" (Unpublished M.A. thesis, University of New Hampshire, 1959). 17 It may not be amiss to point out here that Casona's preoccupation with the Devil and other supernatural elements reveals something very important about his theater, something that has been largely overlooked by the critics- its barroquismo. The interpenetration of the two worlds-the natural and the supernatural-was a characteristic of the Baroque in Spain, es- pecially of the Baroque theater. To such an extent was this true that some of the most rep- resentative plays of the Siglo de Oro have proved all but incomprehensible to periods when such compenetration seemed absurd. Indeed such works as La devoci6n de la Cruz and La vida es suehio still prove difficult of comprehension to the heirs of the enlightenment and positivism. It is significant that our century has not only witnessed a return to G6ngora but one to Calder6n as well. The latter movement has been decried by some critics but there can be no doubt that it has borne mature fruit in the case of Casona.
