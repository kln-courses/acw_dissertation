<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume IX, Number 1, March 1979 CRITICAL NOTICE Isaiah Berlin, Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas. London: Hogarth Press, 1976. xxvii -I- 228 pp. In this book Berlin undertakes, in two loosely related essays, to examine some of the major ideas of two eighteenth century thinkers whose work, in his view, represents an important watershed in European thought, especially about human nature and human history. The first essay, which is concerned with Vico and is considerably the larger of the two, is an expansion of a paper published in Art and Ideas in Eighteenth-Century Italy in 1960; the second, on Herder, is a revision of an article that appeared in Encounter in 1965. Both carry the reader easily, in Berlin's inimitable style (although with some repetitions) over a kaleidoscope of ideas, doctrines and issues, often with a minimum of formal argument, but generally with a sense of cumulation and a richness of allusion that will give pleasure even when they fail entirely to convince. Berlin's treatment of Vico, especially, will doubtless become one of the more important references in English for the study of a philosopher who may seem recently to have been coming into his own, not least through the good offices of Professor Giorgio Tagliocozzo and the International Vico Institute. English readers will be grateful for Berlin's copious quotation from the well-known English translation of Vico's Scienza Nuova by T.G. Bergin and M.H. Fisch, as well as for many helpful references to the secondary literature. Berlin points out that, although both Vico and Herder were eighteenth century writers, their doctrines attained their full effect only in the nineteenth century, largely through the work of others. However, it is not the influence of their ideas upon which he proposes to concentrate: both authors were, in any case, he holds, seriously misunderstood, especially Vico, whose first popularizer, Michelet, set an unfortunate fashion, continued by Croce and others, of simply reading into him his own philosophical concerns. Neither does Berlin wish particularly to call attention to the authors 179</page><page sequence="2">William H. Dray themselves, the one "a timid, obsequious, poverty- and anxiety-ridden scholar, who wrote too much and in haste," the other a rather unpleasant man who lacked conspicuously in his own person the values he most assiduously promoted in his writings. The aim is rather to single out from the vast bulk of what each of them wrote, much of it highly questionable (Vico's work is "baroque" and "confused", Herder's "bristles with contradictions"), certain idSes maitresses which Berlin judges to be of great contemporary interest, indeed of "time-defying" importance. The emphasis throughout is on the modernity of the authors. Among the most important of Vico's ideas, according to Berlin, are the following. First he adumbrated a purely historical conception of human nature in opposition to the traditional view of it as "static and unalterable," a view shared by his Cartesian and anti-Cartesian opponents alike. This allowed him to make nonsense of appeals to "the matchless wisdom of the ancients" as well as to timeless rational principles of the sort sought by theorists of natural law: the origin of man, he insisted, was "crude and barbarous". Second, he arrived at the notion of a species of understanding which is available only to the creator or maker of what is to be understood : a species which, as it were, exploits "inside" knowledge of a thing's coming to be (thus verum et factum convertuntur). Applying this conception first to the interpretation of a priori knowledge in mathematics, he achieved an astonishingly modern view of the latter as certain only because it applies rules which man himself lays down, by contrast with the science of nature which, since it studies an object obeying only the laws of its Divine Creator, can be fully understood only by Him. Vico's really "revolutionary" move, however, was to apply the same epistemological formula, in the end, to human history as well, on the ground that the social world, too, is made by man. Thereby he not only claimed autonomy and distinctiveness for the human studies, but implied further, and quite scandalously, their qualitative superiority. Along with these two key ideas went a notion of human activites as producing "cultures", pervading patterns reflected in the arts, the institutions, the laws, the language, the myths of particular groups of people; and the related notion of "anachronism", the idea of what can and cannot belong to a given culture at a given time - an idea absolutely crucial to the development of a critical historiography. Of comparable importance was Vico's interpreting cultural phenomena, not as artificial products, and still less as social instruments (here he differs from Marx, whom he in other respects somewhat prefigures), but rather as "natural forms of self-expression" which, unlike the testimony of witnesses, yields evidence which is "incorruptible", and 180</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of Berlin, Vico and Herdr is to be probed for what It expresses. In developing such ideas, Vico virtually invented comparative cultural history and anthropology, indeed social science "in the widest sense"; and at the same time, through his notion of the human studies as an exercise of the "reconstructive imagination", or fantasia, he made the first significant contribution to their methodology. All these conceptions, Berlin observes, are major advances in thought, any one of which would "make the fortunes of a philosopher". It is thus rather unfortunate that Vico should be best known to posterity for what is, in fact, "the least interesting, plausible and original of his views": his theory of historical cycles. What needs to be conserved from his "half-abandoned quarry" of ideas, Berlin avers, is not its abortive attempt at "system", but "building blocks .. .capable of being used in the construction of firmer if more modest structures." In Berlin's consideration of Herder many of the same ideas recur - although it is emphasized that, if Herder read Vico, it wasn't until twenty years after his own views were fully formed. According to Berlin, Herder's chief contribution can be summarized in the following three "cardinal" notions which he "originated or infused with new life". The first, which Berlin calls "populism", is the recognition that, for the proper exercise of their faculties, men have a need to belong to "identifiable communal groups, each with its own outlook, style, traditions, historical memories and language". In Berlin's view, this doctrine, which informed everything he wrote, together with his eloquent portrayal of what it is to "belong", made him the most profound social psychologist of his generation. It is true that, in the hands of his successors, Herder's notion of community took on "reactionary forms", and "fed the stream of aggressive nationalism": but for Herder himself, this idea was never political: it was even "anti-political"; and it would be a "moral error", Berlin warns, to assimilate a doctrine to its historical consequences. The second of Herder's "cardinal ideas" Berlin calls "expressionism". This is the claim (echoing Vico's) that "the spiritual activity of men - expressed in art and literature, religion and philosophy, laws and sciences, play and work - consists not in the creation of... artefacts, the value of which resides in themselves. ..but in forms of communication with other men," these to be understood through an exercise of empathy, or einfUhlen, akin to the sensitivity of "a lover, a friend, an intimate," a notion which not only promoted a new aesthetic, but led to a quite novel idea of "artistic commitment", itself rendered the more important by the contention that "all men are in some degree artists". Herder's third idea is "pluralism": the insistence that disparate civilizations and ways of life are not only to be understood, but also to 181</page><page sequence="4">William H. Dray be judged by reference to their own standards, their own collective ideals; and, more generally, a delight in cultural difference for its own sake ("the more extraordinary a culture or an individual," observes Berlin, the "better pleased" Herder was). Taken together, the first and third of these ideas imply that there is no Favoritvolk - a conclusion that Herder hewed to consistently in theory, in spite of minor lapses in practice (for example, in some anti-French outbursts, which Berlin explains away). There is no question of the richness and grace of Berlin's exposition of these and related ideas of his two subjects. Nevertheless, his book can hardly fail to disappoint readers who approach it expecting new insights, not only into what Vico and Herder themselves believed, but also into the importance of their doctrines for ongoing disputes in the philosophy of history and the social sciences. Berlin's emphasis on the presentday relevance of his authors raises expectations in this connection; but in fact he offers little real argument for the conclusion that either of them has anything to teach us that we do not already know. He offers no critical study of the doctrines of either philosopher calculated to show that any special utility or significance attaches to their original formulations: indeed, he specifically repudiates the task of critical analysis; his purpose, he says, is to establish "originality", not "tenability". Thus, in the end, the significance of the doctrines celebrated, and especially those of Vico, may well seem to reduce to that thinnest variety of specifically historical significance that resides in being a remarkable anticipation of later developments - this despite the fact that Berlin himself obviously finds the views of both philosophers thoroughly congenial, to the point where it is not always clear where his elucidation of their various pronouncements leaves off and the elaboration of his own philosophical views begins. It is especially disappointing, in view of the way Berlin praises both Vico and Herder for being among the earliest thinkers to "grasp the fundamental difference between scientific and historical analysis," between Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften , that he offers no critical discussion of such notions as fantasia and einfuhlen, which he sees as located at the very foundation of this distinction. In the case of Vico, he is content to note that the latter "believed" that "in principle we could re-enact in our minds" what we wish to understand in the human past, while conceding that Vico himself never "fully or exactly explains" what this consists in; and he attributes to Herder, without comment, although apparently with approval, such controversial if supposedly puzzle-dissolving claims as that, in the human studies, "explanation and justification... melt into one another". Nor does he face squarely at any point, although 182</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of Berlin, Vico and Herdr he mentions it, the difficult question of what justification Vico could offer, even from the standpoint of his own assumptions, for his application of the verum/factum principle to collective as well as to individual "self-making" (he is said to have been very much aware that history is largely a matter of "unintended consequences") - a question complicated, as Berlin himself concedes, by his supplementary doctrine of the indispensability of "Providence", which Berlin hails as an anticipation of Hegel's "Cunning of Reason". One wonders too about the precise basis of contentions such as that fantasia, or "historical perspective", while not by itself yielding positive conclusions about the past, may at least yield negative ones : for example, that the Romans could not have derived their system of laws from Solon's Athens - an inference offered as the very paradigm of what can be hoped for from the new historical "science". Berlin does, from time to time, seem to hint at arguments that might be significant for the support of Vico's central claims: for example, that the existence of an "anthropomorphic fallacy" presupposes a legitimate way of being anthropomorphic; but these, besides being somewhat remote from the text, appear only in passing remarks. And sometimes he seems virtually to give the game away, as when he observes that it is obvious to us now that knowledge of other human beings, if not actually "gained" by scientific methods, must at any rate be "supplemented, rendered less or more probable, systematized, corrected, justified" by the latter, this coming perilously close to the thesis of contemporary positivists that "imaginative understanding", or "empathy", is, at most, a heuristic device for generating plausible hypotheses. Berlin's most sustained piece of argumentation is contained in a lengthy contribution he offers to the solution of the problem of the sources of Vico's ideas. His own view is that these were stimulated, not by the theological, philosophical and scientific controversies of the time in which others have generally and rather unsuccessfully sought them, but by his strictly juristic studies: it was probably the results of his own imaginative reconstruction of Roman law, he suggests - providing him, as it did, with a "window" into a world that proved far stranger than had been imagined - that set him thinking in the directions so painfully explored in The New Science. This, however, is a scholarly digression in a book chiefly devoted to quite other ends. What Berlin wishes most to show is that his authors are eminently worth studying, not just for their historical interest, but for their contemporary importance. Despite its obvious virtues, it seems doubtful that his account will convince the majority of his readers that this is so. July 1978 WILLIAM H. DRAY University of Ottawa 183</page></plain_text>
