Renewed excavations at Beth-Shemesh by the authors dispelled this unfounded hypoth- esis. In a sequence of Iron I levels, Canaanite cultural traditions are dominant. Only a  meager amount of Bichrome Philistine pottery was found, and other items of Philistine  affiliation are missing. Furthermore, pork consumption was completely avoided at Beth- Shemesh in contrast with adjacent Philistine sites. Review of geopolitical changes in the  Shephelah during the Late Bronze–Iron Age transition indicates that the Canaanite in- habitants of Beth-Shemesh took advantage of their location at the Philistine periphery  and resisted Philistine hegemony. By denying foodways (eating and drinking) that sym- bolized their new aggressive neighbors, the people of Beth-Shemesh culturally identi- fied themselves as “non-Philistine.” But since an inverse process, by which elements of  Philistine culture were adopted by Canaanites living within the Philistine territory, is  also evident, it is apparent that whether adopting or denying Philistine cultural elements,  the indigenous population of the Shephelah changed its previous way of life during Iron  Age I. introduction assumptions, this interpretation cannot stand the scru- tiny of today’s refined archaeological fieldwork and  Situated at the eastern edge of the Sorek Valley— quantitative analyses of the data retrieved.
