Bush If institutional economics is truly an "evolutionary" economics, it is because it has the capacity to explain the phenomenon of institutional change and because it incorporates the principles of that explanation in both theoretical and applied inquiry. While it cannot be argued that all that has been labeled "institutional" economics in the past rests ei- ther explicitly or implicitly on a coherent theory of institutional change, contemporary institutionalists generally agree that such a theory is, and must be, the diagnostic characteristic of the institutionalist perspective. The purpose of this article is to set forth a systematic statement of the institutionalist theory of institutional change. The theory presented is a synthetic statement of what the author understands to be (at its present state of development) the theory of institutional change that informs all analytically grounded contributions to the institutionalist literature. The classical foundations of the theory were laid by Thor- stein B. Veblen, John R. Commons, John Dewey, and Clarence E. Ayres. Contemporary refinements of the theory are to be found in the works of J. Fagg Foster, William Dugger, David Hamilton, F. Gregory Hayden, Louis Junker, Philip Klein, Anne Mayhew, Walter C. Neale, Baldwin Ranson, Marc Tool, and others who have offered explicit dem- The author wishes to thank William M. Dugger for his thoughtful comments on the initial design of this article, James A. Swaney for his careful review and critique of earlier works upon which this article draws heavily, and Marc R. Toolfor his patience and encour- agement in seeing this project through to the end. They are, of course, absolved of any blame for the deficiencies that careful readers will undoubtedly discover. 1075</page><page sequence="2">1076 Paul D. Bush onstrations of the theory of institutional change in their theoretical and applied investigations. The theory, like the phenomenon it purports to explain, has undergone evolutionary change. As the intellectual pace in institutional economics has quickened in recent years, contributions to the theory of institutional change have likewise appeared at an in- creased rate. The following presentation attempts to capture not only those classical principles set forth by Veblen at the turn of the century, but also the most recent contributions that have extended the theory and pointed it in new directions. The article is organized into six major sections. The first section pre- sents a discussion of the institutional structure and the concept of "be- havioral patterns." The second section is devoted to an explication of the "institutional" dichotomy, which is a fundamental tenet of most contemporary institutionalist analyses. The third section examines the concept of the "technological dynamic," which institutionalists believe identifies the basic evolutionary force in social change. The fourth sec- tion describes the manner in which "institutional space" is partitioned by the knowledge fund and the value structure of the institution. The fifth section develops the concept of "ceremonial encapsulation" and explains both "progressive" and "regressive" institutional change. The article concludes with some observations on the discretionary character of social evolution. The Institutional Structure of Society The theory of institutional change must begin with a theoretical for- mulation of the institutional structure. This section and the next are devoted to that formulation. The primary focus in both will be the sig- nificance of the value system of the society in determining the character of the institutional structure. Definition of the Term "Institution" "Society" may be thought of as a set of institutional systems. An "in- stitutional system," in turn, may be thought of as a set of institutions. And an "institution" may be defined as a set of socially prescribed pat- terns of correlated behavior. In each of the above sentences, the term "set" refers to functionally interrelated elements. Social Prescriptions When employing this definition of an institution, institutionalists lay</page><page sequence="3">The Theory of Institutional Change 1077 stress on the term "socially prescribed." While it is entirely possible for human behavior to exhibit random characteristics, institutionalists ar- gue that all behavior within a community is ultimately subject to social prescriptions or proscriptions. This is especially true of all problem- solving (purposive) behavior. The community at large has a stake in the manner in which its tools and intelligence are brought to bear on its life processes. Those patterns of behavior perceived to be vital to the survival of the community are the most carefully prescribed and carry the heaviest sanctions. It is a well-established point in the fields of sociology and child psy- chology that social conditioning begins prior to an infant's capacity to walk or talk.' Throughout one's life, the process of habit formation is the mechanism by which socially prescribed behavior is internalized. While some habits may be learned only through conscious effort, most habit formation is probably unconscious. Such unconscious habitua- tion gives rise to the impression that certain patterns of behavior are "natural" and not amenable to discretionary change. The fruitless "na- ture" versus "nurture" debate is grounded in the misapprehension of unconscious habituation. Institutionalists hold the view that all socially relevant behavior is learned and is, for the most part, habitual.2 While unconscious habituation may account for most observed behavior, par- ticularly "traditional" behavior, this fact must not be allowed to ob- scure the discretionary nature of the social prescriptions that are thereby internalized. Socially prescribed behavior arises from social choices, and the critical history of any culture is the story of how these choices evolved in the life experience of the community. As will be ar- gued at length below, institutional change is discretionary precisely be- cause all social prescriptions are the outcomes of conscious choices made at some point in the life history of the culture.3 Behavioral Patterns The term "patterns of correlated behavior" embodies two important concepts: (1) the notion that behavior within an institution is not ran- dom but purposeful and correlated; and (2) the notion that "values" function as the "correlators" of behavior within and among patterns of behavior. The term "behavioral pattern" (singular) may be thought of as two behaviors (or activities) correlated by a value. This conception of a "behavioral pattern" clearly indicates the social significance of "values." Values function as the standards of judgment by which be- havior is correlated. Values not only correlate behavior within the be- havioral pattern, they also correlate behavioral patterns with one</page><page sequence="4">1078 Paul D. Bush another. The interconnection among behavioral patterns may be envi- sioned as the correlation of one behavior of one behavioral pattern by a given value with the behavior from another behavioral pattern. In essence, the interconnection among behavioral patterns is accom- plished by a behavioral pattern. In order to clarify these relationships, it may be helpful to symbolize a behavioral pattern as follows: B' P B2, where "B"' is one behavior or activity, "B2" is another behavior or activity, and " V' is the value that correlates B' with B2. A second behavioral pattern might be iden- tified as follows: B3 P B4. The correlation of the first behavioral pattern with the second is accomplished through the use of an additional value, B, such that B2 is correlated with B3 through B, which produces a third behavioral pattern: B2 B B3. Thus "behavioral patterns" (plural) are correlated by values, and the correlation of behavioral patterns entails a behavioral pattern. It is, then, the value system of the institution that provides the functional interrelationship of all patterns of behavior within the institution.4 These comments on the nature of the correla- tion of behavior within and among behavioral patterns requires a fur- ther statement about the focus of the social prescriptions that give shape and form to the institutional structure. Clearly, what is pre- scribed are the values that will be employed as correlators of behavi\rr. In other words, a given pair of behaviors or activities can be found in a number of different social contexts, but their relationship to one an- other will change depending on the value system under which they are correlated. This will be discussed at length below. Thus the diagnostic characteristic of an institution is the value structure that correlates the behavior within it. It follows from this that institutional change must entail a change in the value structure of the institution. This matter will also be explored at length later. But another concept fundamental to institutional analysis must be discussed first. It is the notion of the ceremonial-instrumental dichotomy. The Ceremonial-Instrumental Dichotomy Given the central importance of values to the structure of in- stitutions, inquiry into the nature of institutions and the processes of institutional change is inherently normative. All inquiry involves inter- pretation, and interpretation requires judgment.' When the subject matter under investigation is the value system of society, interpreta- tions and their attendant judgments must be made about the value sys- tem. The methodology of institutional economics faces this intellectual</page><page sequence="5">The Theory of Institutional Change 1079 responsibility squarely by incorporating a philosophy of value that per- mits a straight-forward analysis of the value system. In contrast, all schools of mainstream economics attempt to evade this intellectual re- sponsibility by purporting to adhere to the value-knowledge dualism in their methodologies. This positivist tenet is the foundation for claims of "objectivity" in mainstream economics. In the long history of the institutionalist critique of mainstream economics (from Veblen to Tool), this wertfrei methodology has been shown to be not only ster- ile, but counterproductive: normative considerations are not eschewed, they are merely suppressed, thereby obfuscating the true import of the inquiry; and the notion of "objectivity" is held hostage to the positivist dualism. As a consequence of these methodological strictures, main- stream economists have evaded the study of institutional structure (let alone institutional change) by relying on "methodological individual- ism."6 The philosophical foundations of the institutionalist approach to the study of the value system of society is grounded in the classical works of Veblen and Dewey. Their works were synthesized and refined by Clarence E. Ayres. Ayres's student, J. Fagg Foster, and his student, Marc R. Tool, have brought "6social value theory" to its present state of development. It is this particular line of institutionalist thought that informs the treatment of values in this essay.7 Ceremonial Values The institutional structure of any society incorporates two systems of value: the ceremonial and the instrumental, each of which has its own logic and method of validation. While these two value systems are inherently incompatible, they are intertwined within the institutional structure through a complex set of relationships. Ceremonial values correlate behavior within the institution by pro- viding the standards of judgment for invidious distinctions, which prescribe status, differential privileges, and master-servant relation- ships, and warrant the exercise of power by one social class over an- other. The logic of the ceremonial value system, as Veblen put it, is one of "sufficient reason." Validation of ceremonial values is found in ap- peals to tradition and in the formulation of suitable myths (ideologies) that mystify the origin and legitimacy of their existence. Ceremonial values are by their very nature beyond inquiry in the sense that they may not be subjected to critical scrutiny. They may be rationalized through plausible argument, but they are never subjected to any sort of test of refutability. They are accepted on authority and regarded as ab- solute. Presumably, they emanate from human nature and, therefore,</page><page sequence="6">1080 Paul D. Bush are not subject to human discretion. Patterns of behavior in which be- haviors are correlated by ceremonial values are referred to here as "ceremonially warranted" patterns of behavior. The operative criterion by which such patterns of behavior are judged within the community is that of "ceremonial adequacy." Instrumental Values Instrumental values correlate behavior by providing the standards of judgment by which tools and skills are employed in the application of evidentially warranted knowledge to the problem-solving processes of the community. Using Veblen's language once again, the logic of the instrumental value system is that of "efficient cause." Instrumental val- ues are validated in the continuity of the problem-solving processes. Patterns of behavior correlated by instrumental values are referred to as "instrumentally warranted" patterns of behavior. The criterion by which the community judges instrumentally warranted patterns of be- havior is that of "instrumental efficiency." Instrumental values are not, however, fixed or immutable. The problem-solving processes of the community, being dependent on the processes of inquiry and technological change, are inherently dynamic, requiring changes in habits of thought and behavior. As new patterns of behavior are required to accommodate the absorption and diffusion of new technology, instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior must change accordingly; and this requires changes in the instrumental val- ues that correlate such behavior. H.H. Liebhafsky has referred to this capacity for change in the instrumental value system as "self-correcting value judgments."8 A specific standard of judgment is warranted only as long as it provides for instrumental efficiency in maintaining the causal continuity of the problem-solving process. When such a stan- dard loses its capacity to do so, it is replaced by a more appropriate standard. The process is "self-correcting" by virtue of the fact that the processes of inquiry upon which the problem-solving processes depend involve a conscious awareness of the method by which behavior is cor- related. The causal continuity of the problem-solving process is, in principle, open to the surveillance of the community. When a sensed awareness of a disrapport between current instititional practices and instrumental efficiency arises within the community, the community has the capacity to opt for the discretionary change of those patterns of behavior that are no longer appropriate to the problem-solving pro- cesses.</page><page sequence="7">The Theory of Institutional Change 1081 The "Dialectical" Nature of Behavior Whereas the value system of an institution is dichotomous, behavior is "dialectical" in the sense that Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen has used the term; that is to say, behavior may possess either ceremonial or in- strumental characteristics, or possess both ceremonial and instrumen- tal characteristics.9 This fact adds considerable complexity to the forms that behavior patterns may take. As will be shown below, a ceremoni- ally warranted pattern of behavior may incorporate instrumental be- havior, and an instrumentally warranted pattern of behavior may incorporate behavior that has ceremonial characteristics. A few examples may help to clarify the notion of the dialectical na- ture of behavior. Some examples of purely ceremonial behavior (Bc) would include: discrimination on the basis of race, color or creed; "wrapping oneself in the flag"; making a sacrificial offering; using deceit or coercion in manipulating the behavior of others; and kow-towing to those in authority. Some examples of purely instrumental behavior (Bi) would include: sawing a board; practicing the clarinet; painting a pic- ture; dialing a telephone; programming a computer; using persuasion to obtain the cooperation of others; solving a mathematical problem; and taking medicine under a doctor's prescription. Three examples of behavior that possess both ceremonial and instrumental characteristics (Bci) are: taking a bath; giving an order; and standing behind a lectern. Let us turn briefly to an explanation as to why each of the behaviors in this last set are dialectical. The example of "taking a bath" is borrowed from Clarence Ayres's discussion of the "cult of the tub."'0 Noting Veblen's comments on the "ceremonial cleanliness" of the upper classes, Ayres discusses the cere- monial implications of the cult of the tub; but he also points out that whatever may be the ceremonial significance of cleanliness, regular bathing is instrumental to both personal and public hygiene. Similarly, the act of "giving an order" may at once announce one's status as well as perform the instrumental function of supervising the work of others. Most of us can tell the difference between the situation in which the boss issues orders just to remind everyone that he/she is in charge and the situation in which the boss issues orders that are instrumental to the supervision of an employee's work. Lastly, "standing behind a lec- tern" in a classroom clearly establishes the ceremonial status of the pro- fessor; but it is also an instrumentally efficient position from which to deliver a lecture. "I Whether a dialectical behavior will carry primarily ceremonial or in-</page><page sequence="8">1082 Paul D. Bush strumental significance in a given instance depends on the social con- text in which it occurs. Under the theory presented here, that social context is defined by the behavioral pattern in which the behavior is correlated with other behavior in the institutional arrangement. And that correlation is uniquely the function of the value that defines the behavioral pattern. If the value that correlates behavior is ceremonial, the dialectical behavior will take on ceremonial significance: thus, "tak- ing a bath" performs the ceremonial function of displaying status; "giv- ing an order" is intended to let everyone know who the boss is; and "standing behind a lectern" establishes the superior status of the profes- sor over his/her students. If, on the other hand, the value is instrumen- tal, the dialectical behavior takes on instrumental significance: bathing is understood to be necessary to maintenance of both personal and pub- lic health; orders are understood to be necessary to the instrumentally warranted process of supervision; and the physical location assumed by the professor is understood to be a function of his/her need to com- municate effectively. Types of Behavioral Patterns The principle that the mode of valuation (that is, ceremonial or in- strumental) will determine the ceremonial or instrumental significance of dialectical behavior is closely related to another important principle governing the formation of behavioral patterns in general. It was stated earlier that ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior can contain instrumental behavior and that instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior can contain behavior that has ceremonial characteristics. These possibilities emerge because there are a number of ways in which values and behaviors of a ceremonial or instrumental type can be com- bined. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that the number of possible combinations is finite.'2 Using the symbols introduced above, the pos- sible types of behavioral patterns may be enumerated as follows: Ceremonially Warranted Instrumentally Warranted Patterns Patterns (C-1) Bc Vc Bc (1-1) Bi Vi Bi (C-2) Bc Vc Bi (1-2) Bi Vi Bci (C-3) Bc Vc Bci (I-3) Bci Vi Bci (C-4) Bci Vc Bi (C-5) Bci Vc Bci</page><page sequence="9">The Theory of Institutional Change 1083 Several important observations may be made by reference this tabeau of behavioral patterns. First, it should be noted that there are five possible types of ceremo- nially warranted behavioral patterns as compared with only three types of instrumentally warranted behavioral patterns. This reflects the fun- damental differences in the two modes of valuation. The instrumental mode of valuing requires an open-ended process of inquiry capable of evaluating the consequences of the application of any particular stan- dard of judgment in the correlation of behavior. The logic of instru- mental valuation is, therefore, embedded in the causal continuity of the problem-solving process. This delimits the types of behavior to which instrumental values are relevant as correlators. The logic of in- strumental valuation is relevant only to behavior that is somehow in- volved in the tool-skill nexus of the technological continuum. This is symbolized in the above tableau by the appearance of the "i" subscript in all behaviors shown in each of the three cases of instrumentally war- ranted behavioral patterns. Note the complete exclusion of any behav- ior exhibiting only a "c" subscript. In other words, instrumental valuation cannot rationalize purely ceremonial behavior. The values that correlate behavior in the pursuit of the arts and sciences cannot validly be made to justify such things as the imposition of invidious distinctions on the social structure of the community, the use of dis- honesty and deceit in human affairs, or the denial of access to knowl- edge vital to the problem-solving processes of the community by vested interests. In contrast, the ceremonial mode of valuation does not entail such limitations. As shown in the tableau, combinations of all three types of behavior can be correlated through ceremonial values. This is made possible by the very nature of the logic of ceremonial valuation. Resting as it does on the notion of "sufficient reason," the logic of ceremonial valuation may be used to rationalize any combination of behaviors. All that is required is a plausible argument to validate any particular cor- relation of behavior. The boundaries of the logic are as limitless as the human imagination. A particular pattern of behavior may be required "because the memory of man does not run to the contrary," or because "it is the will of God," or because "blacks are inherently inferior to whites," or because "it is consistent with the requirements of national security." There should be no difficulty in seeing that purely ceremonial behav- iors will be correlated by a ceremonial value. But what can be said about those patterns of behavior in which a ceremonial value correlates</page><page sequence="10">1084 Paul D. Bush a ceremonial and an instrumental behavior? Such cases arise in C-2 and C-4 in the tableau. (Note that they do not arise in C-3 or C-5 where the ceremonial value gives ceremonial significance to the behaviors desig- nated "Bci.") In these instances, instrumental behavior is "encapsu- lated" within a ceremonially warranted behavioral pattern, thereby incorporating instrumental behavior in a ceremonially prescribed out- come. Bronsilaw Malinowski provided a detailed description of such be- havioral patterns in his account of the canoe-building practices of the Trobriand islanders.'3 According to Malinowski, two kinds of behavior are clearly involved in the canoe-building activities of the Trobriand- ers; one is ceremonial, the other instrumental. "The building of the sea- going canoe," he says, "is inextricably bound up with [the rituals of the Kula magic].... the technicalities of construction are interrupted and punctuated by magical rites."' 4 For example, before the tree from which the canoe will be carved can be felled, the magician must make an offer- ing to the woodsprite that presumably inhabits the tree and utter an incantation designed to persuade the woodsprite to leave the tree. It is only after this ritual has been performed that the canoe builder can pro- ceed to chop down the tree. The Trobrianders are aware of the differences in the behavior of the magician and the craftsman. They apply instrumental criteria to the evaluation of the technical competence of the craftsman and the results of his efforts. It is clear that they understand that the rituals per- formed by the magician, however mystically potent they are presumed to be, "will not make up' for bad workmanship." Nevertheless, the Tro- brianders would never consider building a canoe except under the guid- ance of the Kula magic, for they believe that "a canoe built without magic would be unseaworthy."'5 It is the logic of magic and ritual, not the logic of the tool-skill nexus of canoe-building technology, that de- termines the correlation of the magician's behavior with that of the craftsman in the above example. In this instance, ceremonial consid- erations are dominant, and a ceremonially warranted standard ofjudg- ment correlates the behaviors of the magician and the craftsman. The instrumental behavior of the craftsman is "encapsulated" within a cere- monially warranted pattern of behavior. It should be obvious that there could be no instrumental warrant for this pattern of behavior because the technology of canoe-building is a causal continuum confined to the realm of evidentially demonstrable consequences within which the rit- ualistic behavior of the magician has no meaning.</page><page sequence="11">The Theory of Institutional Change 1085 The Concept of Ceremonial Dominance The fact that an instrumental behavior can be encapsulated within a ceremonially warranted pattern of behavior leads to a broader set of considerations. In the case of the Trobrianders, Malinowski argues that magic is not merely an extraneous function "having nothing to do with the real work or its organisation." The presumed mystical powers of the magician give him the invidious status of a "natural leader whose command is obeyed, who can fix dates, apportion work, and keep the worker up to the mark."'6 In the language of present analysis, Malin- owski is saying that the entire range of the division of labor in the canoe-building process is dominated by ceremonial considerations.'7 For the Trobrianders, the division of labor inherent in the technology of canoe-building is not a sufficient basis for the correlation of behav- ior. Something more is required to integrate the particular activities of canoe-building with other aspects of the culture; it is the function of magic to meet this requirement. Consequently, the instrumental war- rant for the correlation of behavior inherent in the technology of canoe- building is dominated by a "higher order" of warrantability as the division of labor in this critical enterprise is required to meet the stan- dard of "ceremonial adequacy." This is the phenomenon of ceremonial dominance, and it is by no means confined to the Trobriand society. Institutional economists be- lieve that it is a characteristic of all cultures. In modern, industrial soci- eties, ceremonial dominance is rationalized not through magic but through ideologies. The magician's incantations are replaced by the ha- rangues of the ideologue. Mystical potency is no longer perceived as the ability to drive out the demons of the lagoon; it is now perceived as the capacity to mobilize the Herrenvolk, or to awaken entrepreneur- ial spirit from its slumbers, or to inspire greater productive efforts by the new socialist man. All ideologies possess ritualistic language that serves to block inquiry and to mystify the warrant for socially pre- scribed patterns of behavior. Thus the "untermensch" may be sent to the gas chambers, "property rights" may be viewed as superior to "hu- man rights," and "counterrevolutionaries" may be sent to the gulags.'8 Clarence E. Ayres argued that ceremonially warranted patterns of be- havior stifle progress precisely because they are "past-binding" and in- hibit technological innovation.'9 He noted, however, that ceremonial practices are believed by members of the culture to be the source of instrumental efficiency; thus the Trobrianders believed that a canoe,</page><page sequence="12">1086 Paul D. Bush no matter how well built, would not be sea-worthy unless the prescribed magic rituals were performed. This confusion abounds, Ayres said, be- cause "'ceremonial adequacy' is an imitation of technological effi- ciency. The tribal medicine man purports to be altering the course of events in imitation of the tool activities by which technicians really do alter the course of events."20 As indicated above, it is the encapsulation of instrumental behavior within a ceremonially warranted behavioral pattern that gives plausibility to this imitation of instrumental effi- ciency by ceremonial adequacy. Ayres argued that the degree to which the ceremonial practices of the community inhibit technological innovation will vary from culture to culture and from one historical epoch to another. The fact that techno- logical innovations appear to occur with greater frequency in one cul- ture as compared to another is in part because of the relative degree of "permissiveness" in the ceremonial practices of the two cultures.21 For example, the ceremonial practices of feudalism were less permissive of technological innovation than the ceremonial practices of the system of mercantile capitalism that emerged from the "cracks and crevices" of feudalism. The permissiveness of the ceremonial practices of a cul- ture is a function of ceremonial dominance as defined above. In the analysis that follows, the phrase "index of ceremonial dominance" will be used to indicate the degree of permissiveness within the institutional structure. The two concepts are inversely related; thus a high index of ceremonial dominance would indicate that the institution has a very low degree of permissiveness with respect to technological innova- tion.22 The Dynamic Character of Technological Innovation The foregoing analysis of ceremonial dominance required the pre- mature introduction of the concept of technological innovation. Since this concept is fundamental to the institutionalist theory of institu- tional change, it requires careful consideration, and it is to that task the discussion now turns. The Meaning of "Technology" The term "technology" has been defined in various ways by institu- tionalists. While there is a continuity of meaning to the various defi- nitions, the term continues to produce confusion and often heated dispute.23 Part of the problem arises from the failure of institutionalists always to distinguish clearly technology as a process from the tools or</page><page sequence="13">The Theory of Institutional Change 1087 machinery that embody technology. Sloppy conceptualization along these lines was encouraged by Veblen's (almost) invariant coupling of the words "machine" and "technology." Despite the fact that he habit- ually used the term "machine technology," it is clear that he never in- tended the term to be confined to "machines" as such. Accordingly, when speaking of the relationship of technological change to economic development, he says, the changes that take place in the mechanical contrivances are an expres- sion of changes in the human factor. Change in the material facts breed further change only through the human factor. It is in the human material that the continuity of development is to be looked for; and it is here, there- fore, that the motor forces of the process of economic development must be studied if they are to be studied in action at all.24 Technology for Veblen was a process that arose out of the human pro- clivity for workmanship and the exercise of intellectual curiosity. It was embodied in the tool-skill nexus of problem-solving activities. The es- sence of technological change, therefore, was the change in "prevalent habits of thought" associated with a given state of the arts and sciences. Veblen saw technological change as a process of "cumulative causa- tion." The problem-solving processes of the community generate inno- vations in the ways of "bringing material things to account," thereby changing the industrial environment in which the community works; and this changed environment produces further changes in prevalent habits of thought about how to conduct the community's affairs. Clarence Ayres endeavored to explicate the broad implications of Veblen's notion of machine technology. Comparing Veblen's analysis with John Dewey's philosophy, Ayres argued that Veblen's conception of the technological process was the logical equivalent of Dewey's notion of "instrumentalism."25 According to Ayres, Dewey faced the problem of formulating a concept that would "identify the intellectual procedures of science with the use of instruments and at the same time ... identify the instruments of scientists with the tools which are in still wider use by artisans and craftsmen."26 This is precisely what Veblen had accomplished in his overall treatment of the interplay of science and technology in his description of the manner in which the evolution of the scientific point of view had transformed society.27 In Ayres's view, the confluence of the ideas of Veblen and Dewey require us to think of "technology" in the broadest possible terms. "So defined, technology includes mathematical journals and symphonic scores no less than skyscrapers and assembly lines, since all these are equally the product of human hands as well as human brains."28</page><page sequence="14">1088 Paul D. Bush This broadening of the conception of technology to incorporate the full sweep of the arts and sciences, does not render the notion vacuous; on the contrary, it enhances its theoretical precision. As Anne Mayhew has argued so convincingly, Ayres's integration of Veblen and Dewey brings us to the recognition that the essence of the technological process is "instrumental valuing."29 The instrumental mode of valuation is the thread of continuity running through all of the arts and sciences which permits "the evaluation of the consequences of any particular use of a tool."30 With reference to the foregoing discussion of the ceremonial mode of valuation, it is useful to note that Mayhew cites H.H. Lieb- hafsky's telling observation that ceremonialism inhibits progress pre- cisely because it "inhibits ... the free inquiry necessary for instrumental valuing."3' Thus "technology" is broadly conceived in the institutionalist litera- ture. This is consistent with the "holistic" nature of the institutionalist methodology, which facilitates an understanding of the workings of the economic system as a cultural process.32 From this perspective, the fund of knowledge available to the community for problem-solving purposes is composed of the instrumentally warranted knowledge gen- erated across the full range of the arts and sciences. "Technological in- novation," therefore, can originate in any field of inquiry or creative endeavor. This broadened view of technology also encompasses the no- tion that the knowledge fund is expanded through the efforts of the entire community, not just some academic or scientific elite. The pro- clivities for workmanship and intellectual curiosity, the well-springs of the pursuit of instrumentally warranted knowledge, are the common heritage of all members of the community. Incremental contributions to the knowledge fund occur on a daily basis through the efforts of in- dividuals found in all walks of life and at all levels of the socioeconomic structure of the community. This idea was captured brilliantly in a statement that Solomon Fabricant made before the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress in 1978. In short, the high productivity of the American economy is the end result of a great many different activities involving decisions by millions of sci- entists, engineers, and technicians in laboratories and industry; educators in schools, universities, and training centers; managers and owners of pro- duction facilities; workers and their families and unions; and government officials. Increase of this country's output per hour over the long run is the result of the energy, ingenuity, and skill with which all of us, individually and as a Nation, manage our resources of production.33 The institutionalist view that "capital" can only be meaningfully iden-</page><page sequence="15">The Theory of Institutional Change 1089 tified as the "immaterial capital" of the knowledge and skills possessed by the community at large is founded on the kind of evidence to which Fabricant alludes in this statement.34 The Technological Dynamic The technological process is inherently dynamic. Technological in- novation creates new possibilities for inquiry and problem-solving. Whether it takes the form of ideas embodied in a new mathematical equation, a new physical implement, or a new technique for organizing problem-solving activity, technological innovation involves a change in behavior, and changes in behavior create new problems for the com- munity in the correlation of behavior. This is the process that Veblen called "cumulative causation." He captures the essence of the process in the following passage: All economic change is a change in the economic community-a change in the community's methods of turning material things to account. The change is always in the last resort a change in habits of thought. This is true even of changes in the mechanical processes of industry. A given con- trivance for affecting certain material ends becomes a circumstance which effects the further growth of habits of thought-habitual modes of proce- dure-and so becomes a point of departure for further development of the methods of compassing the ends sought and for further variation of ends that are sought to be compassed.35 The observation that the solution of one problem creates a whole host of new problems, trite though it may be, is nevertheless, pertinent. The expansion of the community's fund of knowledge is not only instru- mental to the solution of problems, it is the means by which new prob- lems are identified. It would appear that anthropological research and studies of the his- tory of technology support the proposition that technological innova- tion is developmental in the sense of being cumulative, combinatorial and accelerating in character. As a cumulative process, it exhibits a one- way time vector; the expansion of the knowledge fund through techno- logical innovation is an irreversible process through time. This is true because the emergence of new technologies involves the combination of previously existing technologies. The time rate of technological in- novation appears to approximate an exponential function, exhibiting a very flat curve through history until the last three centuries. William F. Ogburn, among others, attributed the exponential expansion of the community's knowledge fund to the cumulative nature of its growth. As Ogburn puts it: "The fact that material culture is accumulative, that</page><page sequence="16">1090 Paul D. Bush is, new inventions are not lost but added to the existing stock, and the fact (if it be a fact) that the larger the stock the greater the number of new inventions, suggests at first glance the compound interest law."36 Marc R. Tool uses a graphical presentation of this proposition in his book The Discretionary Economy to illustrate the "exponential growth in the knowledge of continuum."37 These, then, are the major premises upon which the institutionalist hypothesis of the technological dy- namic is based. Clarence Ayres laid particular emphasis on the combinatorial aspect of technological innovation. The thrust of his argument is contained in the following passage: knowledge and skills accumulate. They do so ... because knowledge and skills are objectified in tools and symbols.... The importance of such objectification of this whole aspect of culture is not merely that of accumulation. Rather accumulation is only the minor premise to innovation. The major premise is the combining of previously exisiting "culture traits" to form new ones.38 Ayres's emphasis on the idea that technological innovation is a com- binatorial process bears a striking resemblance to Nicholas Georgescu- Roegen's conception of evolution as "the emergence of novelty by combination."39 In both formulations, the evolutionary process is couched in terms of a "developmental continuity" that rises out of a combination of previously existing traits. Unlike the evolutionary pro- cesses of the biological and physical realms, the emergence of novelty by combination in human culture results from the choices made in the problem-solving processes. In other words, the rate and direction of social evolution is subject to the discretionary control of mankind. Us- ing terminology established earlier in this discussion regarding patterns of behavior, technological innovation involves changes in instrumen- tally warranted patterns of behavior. Such changes are made possible by the mode of instrumental valuation, which permits changes in the standards of judgment by which behavior is correlated. J. Fagg Foster used the term "developmental continuity" to identify both the meaning of evolution and the method by which it was accomplished, that is, instrumental valuing.40 Thus it can be seen that the institutionalist hy- pothesis regarding the technological dynamic is conceptually linked to the instrumental theory of value. The Interface of the Knowledge Fund and the Institutional Structure At any given point in time, the institutional structure of society</page><page sequence="17">The Theory of Institutional Change 1091 incorporates a given fund of knowledge that is distributed between ceremonial and instrumental patterns of behavior. Knowledge is either "encapsulated" within ceremonial patterns or "embodied" within in- strumental patterns of behavior. This distinction in language is re- quired to indicate that the index of ceremonial dominance determines the permissable use of existing knowledge in the community's problem- solving processes. The knowledge fund is translated into problem- solving activities through instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior. But because of the phenomenon of ceremonial dominance, only that part of the knowledge fund that can be reconciled with the existing value structure of the community would be sanctioned for problem-solving purposes. In other words, the instrumental behavior that is permitted within the community is required to meet the stan- dard of ceremonial adequacy. Thus knowledge that cannot be recon- ciled with the need to justify existing patterns of status, power, and other forms of invidious distinctions would not be intentionally sanc- tioned. While ceremonial dominance determines the ceremonial feasibility of the range of permissable behavior, it is the knowledge fund that de- termines the instrumental feasibility of problem-solving activities. When these two standards of feasibility are taken into account, the in- terface of the fund of knowledge with the institutional structure defines an "institutional space" that may be partitioned into four sectors delin- eating the ceremonial and instrumental feasibility of behavioral pat- terns.4' These four sectors are presented schematically in Figure 1 and can be identified as follows: Sector I. In which the behavioral patterns are both ceremonially and instrumentally feasible. Sector II. In which behavioral patterns are instrumentally feasible but ceremonially nonfeasible. Sector III. In which the behavioral patterns are ceremonially feasi- ble but instrumentally nonfeasible. Sector IV. In which behavioral patterns are both ceremonially and instrumentally nonfeasible. Each of these sectors will be discussed in turn. Sector IV can be immediately disregarded since it is an empty set. Behavioral patterns in this sector, even if they could be imagined, are both ceremonially and instrumentally nonfeasible; they would not fall within either the myth structure or the technology of the community. Sector I, on the other hand, is that sector in which the actual institu- tional structure exists. The patterns of behavior in this sector are tech-</page><page sequence="18">1092 Paul D.

The Partitioning of Institutional Space by the Interface of the Knowledge Fund and the Value Structure of the Institution. nologically feasible, and they meet the standard of ceremonial ade- quacy. Sector II defines, for a given state of the knowledge fund, the technological possibilities of the community that are denied to it by the existing level of ceremonial dominance. As will be shown below, it is into this sector that the community would move if "progressive" insti- tutional changes reduced the degree of ceremonial dominance. Sector III may at first blush appear to be socially irrelevant, but as the subse- quent discussion will show, it has always been a factor in human his- tory, particularly in the history of the twentieth century. Sector III contains behavioral patterns that involve an extension of the myth structure that not even the ceremonial encapsulation of instrumental behavior can sustain without a loss of instrumental efficiency to the community at large. Such extensions of the myth structure will be re- ferred to later as "Lysenko effects." It is into this sector that the commu- nity would move if "regressive" institutional change increased the degree of ceremonial dominance. The Process of Institutional Change This discussion has now reached the stage where the process of institutional change can be brought under direct inspection. Both the "regressive" and "progressive" forms of institutional change will be de- lineated. Fundamental to a discussion of either is the concept of "cere- monial encapsulation." In the case of "regressive" institutional change, a particular type of ceremonial encapsulation, the "Lysenko" type, will be shown to be the cause of what might be called the absolute "triumph of imbecile institutions over life and culture."42 Ceremonial Encapsulation In the foregoing discussion of the technological dynamic, it was ar-</page><page sequence="19">The Theory of Institutional Change 1093 gued that the dynamic force for change in the institutional structure is the growth of the community's fund of knowledge. The phenomenon of ceremonial dominance, however, poses an obstacle to the absorption and diffusion of the new knowledge in the form of technological inno- vation. Consequently, a new discovery in the arts or sciences will be incorporated into behavioral patterns only to the extent that the com- munity believes that the previously existing degree of ceremonial dominance can be maintained. Technological innovations will be per- mitted only if it is anticipated that they will not disrupt the existing value structure of the community. This will involve changes in behav- ioral patterns, but any increase of instrumentally warranted behavioral patterns will be offset by concomitant increases in ceremonially war- ranted patterns of behavior. The new ceremonially warranted patterns are required to "encapsulate" the increase in instrumentally warranted behavioral patterns. It is through this process that the community seeks to attain a status quo ante with respect to its value structure. Hence, ceremonial encapsulation, to the extent that it is successful, denies to the community those technological innovations that the existing knowledge fund is capable of generating, thereby depriving the commu- nity of higher levels of instrumental efficiency in the problem-solving processes.43 Two important qualifications must be introduced to the discussion at this point. First, it should be noted that the theoretical formulation of "ceremonial encapsulation" does not require the assumption that the community is omniscient in its effort to "encapsulate" new knowledge. There may be considerable slippage in the process, and technological innovations inconsistent with the existing value structure may indeed be adopted without a full comprehension of the consequences of doing so. To the extent that such innovations "slip through" the ceremonial net, so to speak, some amount of "progressive" institutional change (as defined below) will take place.44 Second, it must be noted that both an- thropological and contemporary studies indicate that all societies at- tempt to maximize the efficiency with which they employ their existing (ceremonially encapsulated) technology. Whatever the community's ta- boos may be that bound use of knowledge, the knowledge that is deemed ceremonially adequate is used to the fullest. If one must grow rice with little more than one's bare hands, it would be wise to study the rice-growing methods of the Vietnamese peasant. And if one must navigate among the South Pacific archipelagos in an outrigger canoe, it would be desirable to do so in one built by the Trobrianders. Veblen's "instinct of workmanship" appears to manifest itself even under the most trying ceremonial circumstances.</page><page sequence="20">1094 Paul D. Bush It is the attempt to preserve the existing value structure in the face of technological innovation that gives the ceremonial practices of the community what Ayres called their "past-binding" character.45 This no- tion is similar to Ogburn's concept of "cultural lag," which he formu- lated to explain the lag in the correlation of adjustments between two interrelated aspects of culture.46 The concept of ceremonial encapsula- tion offers a precise explanation of the cultural lag involved in the in- stitutional response to technological innovation. It focuses on the fact that although "past-binding," the ceremonial practices of the commu- nity are "permissive" in the sense that some aspects of the expanding knowledge fund will be absorbed into the behavioral patterns of the community. As indicated above, this involves the effort to preserve the existing value structure. Thus it is the value structure that correlates behavior within the institution that "lags." Even though there is some technological innovation, as long as the value structure remains un- changed, it cannot be said that an "institutional change" has taken place. Under the logic set forth in the present analysis, an "institutional change" does not take place unless there is a change in the index of ceremonial dominance; which is to say, an institutional change occurs only when thdre is a change in the value structure of the institution. There are three identifiable types of ceremonial encapsulation of the knowledge fund.47 For purposes of identification, the three types of ceremonial encapsulation will be called: (1) the "past-binding" type, (2) the "future-binding" type, and (3) the "Lysenko" type. The "past-binding" type. The first type of ceremonial encapsulation for which the term "cultural lag" is most appropriate involves the "past-binding" resistance of the traditions of the community to the ab- sorption and diffusion of technological innovations. The community responds to unanticipated advances in the arts and sciences (either in- digenous or borrowed from other cultures) by attempting to minimize the impact of the technological innovation on existing habits of thought and behavior. Since technological innovation requires changes in in- strumentally warranted patterns of behavior, it carries with it a threat to the stability of the ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior that traditionally encapsulate the knowledge fund that is the common heri- tage of the community. In the face of this threat, conscious efforts are made to shore up the existing value structure by an elaboration of cere- monial practices designed to minimize the innovation's dislocation of the status quo. Veblen described this type of ceremonial encapsulation as follows: "The innovation finds its way into the system of use and wont at the cost of some derangement to the system, provokes new us- ages, conventions, beliefs, and principles of conduct, in part directed</page><page sequence="21">The Theory of Institutional Change 1095 advisedly to its utilisation or to the mitigation of its immediate conse- quences, or to the diversion of its usufruct to the benefit of given indi- viduals or classes."48 While this type of ceremonial encapsulation is most easily identified in traditional, preindustrial cultures, which ex- hibit very slow time rates of technological diffusion, the cultural lags it produces are also quite evident in modem society. For example, Og- burn argued that the historical delay in the development of workmen's compensation laws, coming almost a century after the onset of the in- dustrial revolution, constituted a major cultural lag.49 But perhaps the most widely recognized evidence of this type of ceremonial encapsula- tion in the standard economics literature is to be found in those studies that report the frustration of the best-laid plans for economic develop- ment in less developed economies. The 'future-binding" type. The second type of ceremonial encapsu- lation involves the active development of technological innovations for the purpose of strengthening and extending the control of vested inter- ests over the life of the community. In this case, the introduction of technological innovations into the life processes of the community is carefully coordinated with the formulation of an appropriate mythol- ogy and related ceremonial practices that rationalize and enforce the legitimacy of the control over the technology by the vested interests that have captured it. The strategy is to promote, capture, and control all those technological innovations that can reasonably be anticipated to have a bearing on the ceremonially warranted exercise of power by the vested interests over the life processes of the community. To the extent that vested interests can maintain control over the process of technological innovation, they effectively control the future of the com- munity, hence the term "future-binding." It is this second type of ceremonial encapsulation that has been the main preoccupation of institutional economists from Veblen to the pre- sent. Veblen formulated the problem in terms of his distinction be- tween "pecuniary" and "industrial" employments, in which the ceremonially warranted pecuniary employments were dominant over the instrumentally warranted industrial employments.50 Contemporary institutionalists have identified this type of ceremo- nial encapsulation in several recent works. F. Gregory Hayden has offered extensive evidence of the capacity of giant enterprises in the chemical, farm machinery, and agribusiness industries to encapsulate science and technology for the purpose of increasing their own power and profits at the expense of instrumental efficiency in maintaining a healthy food chain, the conservation of viable agricultural acreage, and' the preservation of vital social and ecological systems."' The late Louis</page><page sequence="22">1096 Paul D. Bush J. Junker analyzed the ceremonial encapsulation of knowledge pertain- ing to diet and health by what he called the "American food power sys- tem." While many of the conclusions he drew in this study are highly controversial, he offered compelling evidence that those industries in- volved in the production, distribution, and sale of commodities and services relating to nutrition and health have the power to prevent the community from utilizing the complete fund of knowledge available for the proper maintenance of health and dietary practices. In the con- cluding paragraphs of his study, Junker summarizes the social signifi- cance of this "future-binding" type of ceremonial encapsulation as follows: As a general theoretical principle, the ceremonial-instrumental dichotomy posits the existence of a gap between the growing knowledge fund (and the value structure it entails) and the vested interests of the existing power system that governs and exploits its use. All the forces that encapsulate and control knowledge for the benefit of limited vested interests create master-servant relationships between themselves and the community at large, and this produces organized waste. Genuine knowledge sets the outer limits of human potential. But ceremonial forces encapsulate genu- ine knowledge, and thus the human potential, by confining the use of knowledge within the framework of the core values of the established power structure. This encapsulation reduces the community's flexibility and adaptivity to the potentialities of the new knowledge. In the case of the food power system, the encapsulation can lead quite literally to death.52 The Hayden and Junker studies, while focusing on specific industrial clusters, lay bare the underlying process of ceremonial encapsulation that is endemic to the economy as a whole. Other institutionalists have produced works that reveal the specific means by which the process contaminates the entire society. William M. Dugger's study of "corporate hegemony" analyzes the social mechanisms by which this type of ceremonial encapsulation is transmitted throughout the community.53 It is Dugger's contention that the corporation has become the dominant institution in American soci- ety and that this dominance is manifest in its hegemonic influence over all other institutions of the society. This hegemony is maintained, he says, "not through a conspiracy, but through four social mechanisms": subordination, contamination, emulation, and mystification. He iden- tifies each as follows: "Subordination ties all institutions together so that noncorporate institutions are used as means to corporate ends. Contamination puts corporate role motives into noncorporate roles. Emulation allows corporate leaders to gain acceptance, even respect, in</page><page sequence="23">The Theory of Institutional Change 1097 non-corporate leadership roles. And mystification covers the corporate hegemony with a protective (magic) cloak."54 It is through these mech- anisms, Dugger argues, that the corporate interests are able to control the availability and use of knowledge throughout the society. One of the most significant features of his analysis is his treatment of the cere- monial encapsulation of institutions of higher learning by corporate in- terests.55 He shows how the university's instrumentally warranted social goals to pursue unfettered inquiry and to expand the intellectual horizons of its students have been subordinated to the ceremonially warranted corporate goals of industry-specific research and the voca- tionalization of the curriculum. Beginning with Veblen's The Higher Learning in America, institutionalists have stressed the critical impor- tance of the educational system (most particularly, the system of higher education) to the development of society's capacity to adapt to growth in the knowledge fund.56 Dugger's analysis reveals how this critical edu- cational mission has been ceremonially encapsulated to the detriment of the community. John Munkirs has also produced a powerful analysis of the American economy that comes to rest, in part, on his identification of the ceremo- nial encapsulation of technology by what he calls the system of central- ized private sector planning (CPSP), which is dominated by giant financial and industrial corporations. One of his main contentions is that the reality of centralized private sector planning is only dimly per- ceived by policy makers and the public at large because their view of the real world is obscured by the mythical Weltanshauung of capitalist ideology. In the language of the present analysis, this ceremonially war- ranted perception of reality has impaired our society's capacity to de- velop instrumentally warranted social policies. Munkirs sums up the matter in the following passage: Unfortunately, in America, the real choices that our technological knowl- edge make possible (choices between different production and distribution systems, for example, centralized versus decentralized) have been circum- scribed by, or encapsulated within, our capitalistic ideology and, in par- ticular, by the values of self-interest, profit seeking, and laissez-faire. In brief, the particular type of centralized planning that exists in America today is due neither to technological determinism nor to conspiratorial machinations. Rather, CPSP is a direct result of combining the values of self-interest, profit seeking, and laissez-faire with certain technological possibilities."7 Munkirs's detailed analysis of the structure and functioning of the cen- tralized private sector planning system provides dramatic evidence of</page><page sequence="24">1098 Paul D. Bush the existence of "future-binding" ceremonial encapsulation throughout the entire economy of the United States. While space does not permit an extended discussion of the subject, it must be noted that a driving force for "future-binding" ceremonial encapsulation in the twentieth century has been the military-industrial complexes of the nations of the world. Veblen set forth the first system- atic analysis of the military-industrial complex in 1917. He demon- strated how the ceremonial preoccupation with nationalism, patriotism, and the pecuniary employments encapsulate technology and the industrial employments at the expense of life and culture.58 For- tified by appropriately formulated myths (for instance, "the balance of powers," "mutually assured destruction," "strategic defense initia- tive"), the military-industrial complex has virtually unlimited capacity to produce, capture, and control modem technology. The degree of ceremonial dominance enjoyed by the military-industrial complex in the United States is indicated by the fact that most Americans take it for granted that not only national security but economic stability is de- pendent on a "strong national defense." The "Lysenko" type. In the "past-binding" and "future-binding" types of ceremonial encapsulation, genuine knowledge is encapsulated by the ceremonial beliefs and practices of the community. In the "Ly- senko" type of ceremonial encapsulation, on the other hand, the com- munity attempts to achieve instrumentally nonfeasible outcomes through ceremonially warranted behavioral patterns. This is the ex- treme case of ceremonial practices imitating instrumental efficiency. Under the concept of institutional space set forth earlier, such an effort pushes the community into Sector III, which entails ceremonially fea- sible, but instrumentally nonfeasible patterns of behavior. Spurious "knowledge" is substituted for genuine knowledge, and ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior displace instrumentally warranted pat- terns of behavior in critical areas of the community's problem-solving processes. This type of ceremonial encapsulation is called the "Lysenko" type, after Trofim D. Lysenko, whose name has become synonymous with the corruption and manipulation of science for ideological purposes. Lysenko was the Russian "agrobiologist" who argued that genetic change could be induced through the environmental conditioning of biological organisms. Although his theories were diametrically opposed to the evidentially warranted hypotheses developed over the previous century in the field of genetics, they were embraced by Stalin as the only biological theories consistent with Marxist-Stalinist ideology. Ly-</page><page sequence="25">The Theory of Institutional Change 1099 senko's theories became the official dogma in agronomy and the sup- porting biological sciences. The application of Lysenko's theories to the growing of field crops produced disastrous results; nevertheless, Lysen- koism dominated Soviet science for thirty years. But perhaps the most devastating effect Lysenkoism had on the reduction of instrumental efficiency in the Soviet Union was not its impact on the practice of ag- riculture, but its impact on the practice of science.59 History offers numerous examples of the "Lysenko" type of ceremo- nial encapsulation, but space limitations permit only a brief mention of two cases (one historical, and the other potential) that have emerged in the twentieth century. The most notorious historical case is, of course, the Nazi theory of Ayrian racial supremacy. The Nazis did not invent anti-Semitism and racism; these virulent forms of invidious dis- crimination were the cultural heritage of Europe. The Nazi innovation was to formulate a theory that would provide a cloak of "scientific" legitimacy for the racial laws adopted in the Third Reich. The new, spu- rious "science" displaced genuine science, thereby providing the intel- lectual foundation for the monstrous crimes against humanity that followed. Turning to the potential case, while it is perhaps not the same threat to civilization that the Nazi racial theories were, the so-called science of "creationism" is, nevertheless, a contemporary example of a "Lysenko" type of ceremonial encapsulation going somewhere to hap- pen. Creationists, encouraged by the moral support of President Rea- gan, are engaged in a nationwide campaign to place "creationism on a par with classical evolution in public school instruction."60 Aside from the damage this would cause to the teaching of science, one can only speculate on the broader social ramifications of a successful creationist campaign to substitute religious dogma for the processes of inquiry. The Definition of Institutional Change Institutional change takes the form of a change in the value structure of the institution. A change in the value structure may be measured theoretically by a change in the institution's index of ceremonial domi- nance. The index of ceremonial dominance reflects the dominance of ceremonially warranted values over instrumentally warranted values in the correlation of behavior in the behavioral patterns of the institu- tion. An increase in the index of ceremonial dominance entails the dis- placement of instrumentally warranted values by ceremonially warranted values in the correlation of behavior. An increase in the in- dex of ceremonial dominance signifies a "regressive" institutional</page><page sequence="26">1100 Paul D. Bush change. A decrease in the index of ceremonial dominance entails the displacement of ceremonially warranted values by instrumentally war- ranted values in the correlation of behavior. A decrease in the index of ceremonial dominance signifies a "progressive" institutional change. As already indicated in the foregoing discussion of "past-binding" and "future-binding" ceremonial encapsulation, the index of ceremonial dominance may remain unchanged if ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior increase at a rate sufficient to encapsulate increases in in- strumentally warranted patterns of behavior brought about by changes in the community's fund of knowledge. In such cases, there is no insti- tutional change. "Regressive" Institutional Change The "Lysenko" type of ceremonial encapsulation (called a "Lysenko effect") generates "regressive" institutional change by causing the dis- placement of instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior by ceremo- nially warranted patterns of behavior, thereby raising the index of ceremonial dominance in the community. This is a quite different out- come from the institutional adjustments associated with either "past- binding" or "future-binding" ceremonial encapsulation. In those cases, the index of ceremonial dominance remains unchanged, and there is a net increase in the instrumental efficiency of the community, meager though it may be. In the case of a "Lysenko effect," there is a net loss of instrumental efficiency because there is no way to maintain legiti- mate scientific or technological practices in those parts of the commu- nity affected directly or indirectly by the intrusion of the spurious "science." The Russian agronomists and biologists who opposed Ly- senkoism were expelled from the academies or worse. Agricultural practices were modified to meet the Lysenkoist criteria, and agricul- tural productivity declined. A similar fate befell the German scientists, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens who disputed Nazi dogma. Their options were: (1) remain on the faculties, join the party, and teach the despised doctrines; (2) speak out against these intellectual outrages and risk death or the concentration camps; or (3) emigrate. The loss of in- strumental efficiency to the community was measured ultimately by the Holocaust and the death and destruction of World War II. While one can be sanguine that "regressive" institutional changes are ultimately reversible, since the demonstrable adverse consequences of spurious "knowledge" cannot be long endured in the life processes of the community without a sensed awareness that something is amiss,</page><page sequence="27">The Theory of Institutional Change 1101 Veblen admonished us to remember that "history records more fre- quent and more spectacular instances of the triumph of imbecile insti- tutions over life and culture than of peoples who have by force of instinctive insight saved themselves alive out of a desperately precar- ious institutional situation."6' Lysenkoism lasted for thirty years in Russia; and while the Third Reich lasted for only twelve, the cost of reversing the "regressive" institutional changes it spawned were ulti- mately borne by the entire world. Progressive Institutional Change "Progressive" institutional change occurs when, for a given fund of knowledge, ceremonial patterns of behavior are displaced by instru- mental patterns of behavior.62 This entails an increased reliance on in- strumental values in the correlation of behavior within the community, thereby lowering the index of ceremonial dominance. The dis- placement of ceremonial patterns by instrumental patterns of behavior moves the institution into Sector II, which was defined by the interface of the knowledge fund and the original index of ceremonial dominance. Sector II, it will be recalled, isolates that institutional space in which behavioral patterns are instrumentally feasible but ceremonially non- feasible. In other words, this sector contains those behavioral patterns that the knowledge fund makes possible but which cannot be under- taken because of ceremonial restraints on behavior. "Progressive" in- stitutional change involves technological innovations that break down those ceremonial barriers. To reiterate, innovations in the arts and sciences bring about growth in the fund of knowledge, but the new knowledge is incorporated into the problem-solving processes only to the extent that it is possible for the community to maintain the previously existing level of ceremonial dominance. With the exception of the "Lysenko" type, the process of ceremonial encapsulation involves some technological innovation. This is the first phase of institutional adjustment. Even though the new instrumental patterns of behavior generated through the technological innovation are ceremonially encapsulated, they are integrated into the experience of the community. The new standards of instrumental val- uing they bring to the problem-solving processes have demonstrable consequences that become known to the community. As the commu- nity becomes habituated to employing these new standards of judg- ment in the correlation of behavior, the learning process reveals new opportunities for their application elsewhere in the problem-solving</page><page sequence="28">1102 Paul D. Bush processes. The diffusion of the new instrumental values throughout the community erodes the ideological foundations of those ceremonial practices that are dominant in the affected areas of activity. Eventually, instrumental standards of judgment displace ceremonial standards of judgment in the correlation of behavior in a range of problem-solving activities not contemplated in the original technological innovation. "Progressive" institutional change is, then the second phase of the insti- tutional adjustment brought about by innovations in the arts and sci- ences. Veblen's conception of "cumulative causation" explains the dynam- ics of the process that produces "progressive" institutional change. Technological innovation changes the objective circumstances of the community; the new set of circumstances alters habits of thought and behavior; these new habits of thought and behavior are projected into other areas of the community's experience, giving rise to further inno- vations in the arts and sciences, which, in turn, produce new techno- logical innovations in the community's efforts "to turn material things to account."63 Veblen believed that the change in the material circum- stances of the culture brought about through the introduction of ma- chine technology during the Industrial Revolution conditioned working people to think in terms of cause and effect. "The machine," he said, "throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought."64 This affects not only the ability of working people to become consciously aware of the manner in which their behavior is correlated in the workplace, but also their ability to think in causal terms about broader social relation- ships that affect the life processes of the community. Machine technol- ogy creates the material circumstances that are inhospitable to those habits of thought that rationalize ceremonial patterns of behavior. "Its scheme of knowledge and of inference is based on the laws of material causation, not those of immemorial custom, authenticity, or authori- tative enactment."65 Thus the working people in an industrial society are less likely to submit to the kind of master-servant relationship that existed under feudalism. The industrial system gives rise to an "animus of insubordination" and the individual's status shifts from "subject" to "citizen."66 A critical factor in bringing about "progressive" institutional change is a sensed awareness within the community that there is a need to modify habitual patterns of thought and behavior in order to achieve a higher level of instrumental efficiency in the problem-solving pro- cesses. Veblen saw this sensed awareness arising out of the change in the material circumstances of the community brought about by the in-</page><page sequence="29">The Theory of Institutional Change 1103 troduction of machine technology. Other factors affecting the material circumstances of the community can also bring about such a sensed awareness. Clarence Ayres stressed the importance of the "frontier ex- perience" in breaking down the allegiance to traditional patterns of be- havior.67 Environmental catastrophes that disrupt the physical habitat of the community can also have a profound effect on the community's willingness to consider alternative patterns of behavior as a simple mat- ter of survival. Finally, contact with other cultures through war or trade can induce a sensed awareness of new possibilities for social adapta- tion.68 One additional brief comment must be made on a subject that should be given detailed attention, and that is the dynamic interrelationship between "progressive" institutional change and growth in the knowl- edge fund. It is clear that there is a feed-back relationship between "pro- gressive" institutional change and further growth in the knowledge fund. As the theory has been formulated so far, it is the change in the fund of knowledge, generated by the community-wide problem-solving processes (incorporating both formal and informal processes of in- quiry), that provokes institutional adjustment. As the second phase of institutional adjustment ("progressive" institutional change) lowers the index of ceremonial dominance in the community, it becomes easier to absorb and diffuse technological innovations; but it is also this pro- cess that accelerates the growth of knowledge. As Milton Lower puts it, "knowledge increases in the degree that it is used."69 The higher rates of technological innovation made possible by a lower index of ceremo- nial dominance provide the social environment conducive to the pro- cesses of inquiry throughout the culture. Thus, the growth of knowledge is both the cause and consequence of "progressive" institutional change. The dynamic relationship between the growth in knowledge and "progressive" institutional change is presented schematically in Figure 2. The Limits to "Progressive" Institutional Change There is, of course, nothing inevitable about "progressive" institu- tional change. Veblen expressed his generally pessimistic view about it when he warned of the "triumph of imbecile institutions over life and culture." The historical reality of "regressive" institutional change has already been acknowledged.

The Dynamics of the Relationship between Growthl in the Knowledge Fund and the "'Progressive" Institutional Change.</page><page sequence="31">The Theory of Institutional Change 1105 change on anything but the most narrowly defined range of cultural ac- tivity is probably impossible. Nevertheless, the theory does specify qualitative limitations on the generation and rate of institutional change. They are: (1) the availability of knowledge; (2) the capacity for understanding and adaptation; and (3) the principle of minimum dis- location.70 The availability of knowledge. The breadth and depth of the accu- mulated fund of knowledge available to the community clearly sets the limits to the feasibility of institutional change. The greater the fund of knowledge, the greater the potential for institutional change. Scientifi- cally primitive societies do not exhibit rapid rates of "progressive" in- stitutional change. The dynamics of technological innovation are at work in these communities as in any other, but the time rate of change is constrained by the paucity of the technological base from which the innovations must spring. "Cultural borrowing" can make a significant difference to the rate of change in any society since the transfer of tech- nology from other cultures creates a quantum increase in the borrowing culture's knowledge fund.7' The institutional consequences of this fact have been the focus of the institutionalist literature on economic devel- opment.72 Development programs involving technological transfer from advanced to less-developed economies, in order to be successful, must anticipate the "progressive" institutional changes that will be re- quired to accommodate the new technology; otherwise ceremonial en- capsulation will significantly diminish the culture's ability to adopt and diffuse the technology.73 The capacity for understanding and adaptation. The ability of the members of the community to understand and adapt to the changes in habits of thought and behavior entailed by technological innovations affects the time rate of both the adoption and diffusion of the innova- tions. There must be some social mechanism to facilitate the changing of habits of thought if "progressive" institutional change is to occur. Veblen's analysis of the impact of the "discipline of the machine" on the institutional structure was premised on the fact that a broad cross- section of the population came into contact with machine technology on a daily basis. The workplace served as a "school of hard knocks" so to speak. Contemporary institutional economists lay greater stress on the educational system of the culture as the most important social mechanism performing this function. But, as the earlier discussion of Dugger's theory of corporate hegemony revealed, it is clear that the educational system can be so organized as to inhibit rather than en- hance "progressive" institutional change. If it is organized along invid-</page><page sequence="32">1106 Paul D. Bush ious lines that reflect the existing occupational structure, it will simply reinforce the status quo and contribute to increasingly sophisticated strategies for the ceremonial encapsulation of the knowledge fund. If it is to contribute to the community's capacity for understanding of and adaptation to advances in the knowledge fund, the educational system must be organized for that purpose. Baldwin Ranson states the matter plainly. Educational planners can promote economic progress by providing every- one with the skills necessary to master the best technology. That planning objective is not dictated by any occupational structure, but rather by the nature of technological progress: the more the community knows, the more it can learn. Transmitting the ability to adapt to evolving technologi- cal opportunities will maximize economic progress as well as educational excellence, not as measured by competitive superiority of one group over another, but by the growing potential for economic and social wellbeing of the entire community.74 In sum, the time rate of "progressive" institutional change is bounded by the community's capacity to learn the adaptive skills necessary to absorb technological innovation. The principle of minimal dislocation. The principle of minimal dis- location is critical to an understanding of both the direction and rate of "progressive" institutional change.75 The principle states that while technological change always involves dislocation in the institutional structure, the interdependence of the institutional structure is such that "progressive" institutional change is possible only if it involves a mini- mal dislocation of the behavioral patterns of the community. Techno- logical innovation in the context of "progressive" institutional change always involves the displacement of ceremonial patterns of behavior, and it may also involve the displacement of outmoded technology. Such dislocation of the institutional structure is inherent in the process. But those patterns of behavior that are displaced by the technological innovation are interlinked with other patterns of behavior (both cere- monial and instrumental) throughout the institutional structure of the society. As the earlier analysis of behavioral patterns indicated, the va- riety of forms that behavioral patterns can take introduce considerable complexity into the institutional structure. Ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior may contain instrumental behavior as well as cere- monial behavior.76 Thus care must be taken not to displace ceremonial practices that encapsulate instrumental activities vital to the problem- solving processes of the community. To illustrate the argument, recall the case of canoe-building in the</page><page sequence="33">The Theory of Institutional Change 1107 Trobriand culture. The division of labor within the culture as a whole that regulated not only the tasks of the craftsmen in building the canoe but also the correlation of canoe-building with other activities of the culture was ceremonially encapsulated by a system of magic and ritual. A "progressive" institutional change that would free the division of la- bor in canoe-building from magic and ritual, but would not somehow provide for the reintegration of canoe-building with other activities of the community still under the rule of magic and ritual, would entail a maximum dislocation of the institutional structure. The attempt to in- troduce an instrumentally warranted division of labor in one part of the culture would disrupt the instrumentally vital (but ceremonially en- capsulated) division of labor on a culture-wide basis. It is highly un- likely that any community (scientifically primitive or advanced) would knowingly undertake institutional changes that entail a maximal dislo- cation of the institutional structure, but this does not preclude the pos- sibility that errors in judgment or lack of knowledge could lead to maximal dislocation. Thus the principle of minimal dislocation pro- vides insight into the problems that must be addressed in any form of social or economic planning.77 The Discretionary Character of Institutional Change Marc Tool describes "progressive" institutional change as change that "provides for the continuity of human life and the noninvidious recreation of community through the instrumental use of knowledge."78 This language is descriptively accurate of the process in which ceremo- nially warranted patterns of behavior are displaced by instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior under conditions of minimal disloca- tion. It is the institutionalist view that this is in fact what happens when the community alters its behavior to accommodate the use of existing knowledge. But it is also clear that Tool's language states a social value principle that is applicable to the formulation of social policy. It pro- vides a criterion for selecting among alternative institutional arrange- ments when the purpose is to achieve genuine progress in the community's problem-solving processes. Thus the theory of institu- tional change presented here achieves a dual purpose: it provides an explanation of the process of institutional change while at the same time it reveals the social value criterion most appropriate to the plan- ning of the process. It would not be historically accurate to suggest that all institutional changes result from the conscious formulation of social policy, and it</page><page sequence="34">1108 Paul D. Bush has not been the author's intention to make such an argument. What has been argued is that the evolution of a culture results from the choices made to adopt or not to adopt the technological innovations. The intentional choice to improve the instrumental efficiency of the community through the adoption of a technological innovation does not necessarily involve the intention to throw over some aspect of the ceremonial practices of the culture. The displacement of ceremonially warranted patterns of behavior by instrumentally warranted patterns of behavior is a consequence of the extension of instrumental valuing in the correlation of behavior. The "progressive" institutional changes that have brought modern cultures to their present stage of develop- ment may have appeared to have been quite unremarkable at the time of their occurrence. This is most likely to be true of the process of tech- nological diffusion wherein the adaptation to new technology requires incremental adjustments in the habits of thought and behavior over a broad cross-section of the community. Nevertheless, no matter how subtle the process, it involves the making of choices, and these choices define the evolutionary continuum of the culture. A conscious awareness of the nature of the choices made in the pro- cess of social evolution is a precondition to the planning of that process. By revealing the nature of these choices, the institutionalist theory of institutional change demonstrates that social evolution is subject to the discretionary control of mankind. It is this realization that informs the institutionalist approach to public policy formation. In the institution- alist view, social problems arise when the institutional structure is un- able to accommodate the noninvidious application of instrumentally warranted knowledge to the support of the life processes of the commu- nity. The solutions to social problems take the form of "progressive" institutional changes that will alter those ceremonially warranted pat- terns of behavior that thwart the extension of instrumental valuing in the problem-solving processes. Tool argues that the social value principle that emerges in this theory of institutional change has the greatest potential for successful applica- tion within a democracy polity.79 Those habits of thought that make instrumental valuing possible are most likely to be nurtured in a system of democratic self-governance.80 He cites three reasons for this affinity: (1) because democracy "encourages the development of distinctively human potentialities for creative and reflective use of the mind"; (2) because it "engenders an experimental approach to social change"; and (3) because "self-rule generates consequences that must be endured, a democratic public becomes increasingly self-conscious about the char-</page><page sequence="35">The Theory of Institutional Change 1109 acter of the value theory it employs."8' As Ayres put it, "The essence of democracy is not the fact of majority rule, but rather the process by which majorities are formed."82 For the institutionalist, the process by which majorities of a democracy are formed is identical with the pro- cess of inquiry upon which instrumental valuing depends. Thus, de- mocracy is the political process most likely to nurture the conscious exercise of human discretion over the evolution of the society. Notes 1.

Most institutionalists would agree that in real time there can be discontinuities and "quantum leaps" in the rate of growth that require the qualification that the function is only a rough approximation of an exponential curve. This qualification does not, however, reach to the notion of "developmental continuity" discussed in the following paragraphs. 38. Ayres, Toward a Reasonable Society, pp. 112-13.

Junker, commented extensively on the principle of continuity in his article entitled "Instrumentalism, the Principle of Continuity and the Life Pro- cess," American Journal of Economics and Sociology 40 (October 1981): 381-400. 41. This discussion of the partitioning of "institutional space" is based on a mathematical modelling of these relationships developed by the author in "A Veblen-Ayres Model of Institutional Change: A Provisional Formula- tion," a paper presented at the Annual Meetings of the Western Economic Association, Anaheim, California, 21 June 1977. 42. The language, "the triumph of imbecile institutions over life and culture" is, of course, Veblen's ringing phrase. See Thorstein Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1964 [1914]), p. 25. 43. The term "ceremonial encapsulation" has only recently been introduced into the institutionalist literature. The author and the late Louis J. Junker, unbeknown to one another, began using the term almost simultaneously in their teaching and writing. The author's first effort to define the term rigorously appeared in "A Veblen-Ayres Model of Institutional Change: A Provisional Formulation." The author presented an application of its use in "The Ceremonial Encapsulation of Capital Formulation in the Ameri- can Economy," a paper presented to the Western Social Science Associ- ation, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, 27 April 1979, and extended the rigorous treatment of the concept in "An Exploration of the Structural Characteris- tics," pp. 35-66. For Louis J. Junker's theoretical formulation of the con- cept, see: "The Ceremonial-Instrumental Dichotomy in Institutional Analysis: The Nature, Scope, and Radical Implications of the Conflicting Systems," American Journal of Economics and Sociology 41 (April, 1982): 141-50; and "The Conflict Between the Scientific-Technological Process and Malignant Ceremonialism," American Journal of Economics and So- ciology 42 (July, 1983): 341-52. The dates of these articles do not accu- rately reflect the time frame in which Junker began using the term since both were published several years after the papers on which they are based were presented to various professional societies. Junker's most detailed ap- plication of the concept of ceremonial encapsulation to a specific problem area is to be found in his "Nutrition and Economy: Some Observations on Diet and Disease in the American Food Power System," Review of Insti- tutional Thought 2 (December 1982): 27-58. The author has commented on the origin of the concept and Louis Junker's pioneering application of it in an article entitled "On the Concept of Ceremonial Encapsulation," Review of Institutional Thought 3 (December 1986): forthcoming. Whether the term "ceremonial encapsulation" is merely a new way of referring to well-established concepts in the institutionalist literature or, for better or worse, an extension of institutionalist analysis into new intellectual terri- tory is a matter that must yet be settled. For two important contributions to the deliberations on this point, see William T. Waller, Jr., "The Evolu- tion of the Veblenian Dichotomy: Veblen, Hamilton, Ayres, and Foster," Journal of Economic Issues 16 (September 1982): 757-71; and Hans E.

A special case of this kind of "slippage" is discussed as the "add on" process in Bush, "An Exploration of the Structural Characteristics," pp. 59-61. 45. Ayres, Toward a Reasonable Society, pp. 30, 137, and 233. 46. See Ogburn, On Cultural and Social Change, pp. 200-213. The similarities between the works of Veblen and Ogbum have been widely noted, and the notion of the cultural lag is often attributed to Veblen. He did not, of course, use the term. Ogburn denied that his formulation of the concept was influenced by Veblen. There are some fundamental differences be- tween the Veblen-Ayres approach and Ogburn's. Whereas Veblen and Ayres postulate technological innovation as the dynamic factor generating the cultural changes to which there is a lagged cultural response, Ogburn argued that changes in those aspects of culture identified by Veblen and Ayres as "ceremonial" could be the dynamic cause of a lagged cultural re- sponse. Nevertheless, Ogburn's comments on this point do not appear to offer a serious challenge to the arguments made by Veblen and Ayres. Vir- tually all of Ogburn's own studies treat technology as the "independent variable"; and in those instances where he would appear to make ceremo- nial practices the independent variable, a case can be made that he failed to probe far enough along the chain of causal events to discover the tech- nological innovation that produced the change in the ceremonial practices. As will be demonstrated in the following paragraphs, "regressive" institu- tional changes prompted by purely ceremonial considerations force the community into Sector III, and this results in a loss of instrumental effi- ciency. This line of analysis directly contradicts Ogburn's speculations. See William F. Ogburn, On Culture and Social Change: Selected Papers, ed. Otis D. Duncan (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1964), p. 87. 47. This discussion of the three types of ceremonial encapsulation is based on the author's presidential address to the Association for Institutional Thought entitled "On the Concept of Ceremonial Encapsulation" (Albu- querque, New Mexico, 29 April 1983), a revised version of which appears in The Review of Institutional Thought 3 (December 1986): forthcoming. 48.

In one of his most remarkable essays, Veblen described in some detail the mental processes involved in achieving the "sensed awareness" discussed here. In "The Intellectual Pre-eminence of Jews in Modem Europe," Veb- len argues that the cultural alienation of the European Jew gave rise to a "skeptical animus" among Jewish intellectuals that emancipated them from the ceremonial practices of both the Christian culture and their own traditional heritage. Being thus released from the "dead hand of conven- tional finality," they were free to explore truly innovative approaches in all of the arts and sciences. The intellectual transformation of the European Jew was, for Veblen, a metaphor for the emergence of the scientific habit of thought. See "The Intellectual Pre-eminence of Jews in Modem Eu- rope," in Essays in Our Changing Order, ed. Leon Ardzrooni (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1964 [1934]), pp. 219-31.

These three limiting conditions of "progressive" institutional change were discussed by Marc Tool in The Discretionary Economy, pp. 172-76. They were originally formulated by J. Fagg Foster and presented in his lectures at the University of Denver in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A severely truncated version of his treatment of them appears in Foster, "Syllabus for Problems of Modem Society: The Theory of Institutional Adjustment," Journal of Economic Issues 15 (December 1981): 929-35. 71. "Cultural borrowing" is the term Veblen used to identify this phenomenon in Imperial Germany; see especially pp. 19-43. 72. See, for example, Louis J. Junker, "Capital Accumulation, Savings- Centered Theory, and Economic Development," pp. 25-43; and Philip A. Klein, "An Institutionalist View of Development Economics," Journal of Economic Issues 1 1 (December 1977): 785-807. 73. While David Seckler may not regard himself as an institutionalist, he has provided solid evidence of the correctness of the institutional position on this point in his article entitled "Institutionalism and Agricultural Devel- opment in India," Journal of Economic Issues 20 (December 1986): 1011-1027. 74. Baldwin Ranson, "Planning Education for Economic Progress," p. 1063. 75. While there can be no question that J. Fagg Foster formulated this princi- ple, it is clear that Clarence Ayres had an intuitive grasp of it, as indicated by the following statement: "It is also true that the sudden nullification of the ceremonial system of any community would produce a grievous state of disorganization." See Ayres, Toward a Reasonable Society, p. 138. 76. To reiterate the point by way of an additional example, it should be re- called that Veblen found a "non-invidious residue" even in the ceremonial labyrinth of organized religion. He commented favorably on the instru- mentally warranted" sense of communion with the environment, or with the generic life process-as well as the impulse of charity or of sociability," which he found to be encapsulated in religious life.

While Bronowski was not an institutionalist, his philosophical writings have been most enthusi- astically embraced by them. 81. Tool, Essays in Social Value Theory, pp. 25-26. 82.
