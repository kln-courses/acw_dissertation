<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDUSTRIAL HISTORY, PREINDUSTRIAL LITERATURE: GEORGE ELIOT'S MIDDLEMARCH BY JESSIE GIVNER An especially gruesome historical event impresses itself on the minds of several characters in Eliot's Middlemarch. The first allusion to that event occurs when Mr. Hackbutt, explaining his reservations about the 1832 Reform Bill, remarks, "I myself should never favour immoderate views-in fact I take my stand with Huskisson."I William Huskisson, who opposed reform until it was all but inevitable, is remembered equally well for his horrific death. In 1830, after he had resigned as Secretary of State, he was riding in one of the show trains that marked the beginning of the railway system. When the train stopped, Huskisson stepped down onto the tracks to admire the new machine. The accident is related in one particularly vivid account: Those inside [the train] stretched their legs discreetly and consulted their watches, wondering how long it would be before the other engine reached them. "I think you had better get in," called the Duke of Wellington to the loiterers outside. Only then did they see the Rocket bearing down on them fast on the other rails. There was not enough room, they suddenly realised, for them to stand safely on the opposite side of the line, and no space either between the two sets of rails . . . The former Secretary of State had already tried to escape the oncoming train by crossing the track. He now ran back in panic and was clutching at one of the doors when the engine caught him and flung him on the rails. Even inside the carriage, Lady Wilton could distinctly hear the crushing of bones, followed by Mrs. Huskisson's piercing shriek.2 This accident, compulsively repeated in Eliot's text, is referred to a few chapters later, when Mr. Raffles takes "the new-made railway, observing to his fellow-passengers that he considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson" (379). As Linda Colley notes, the death of Huskisson became a historical set-piece, in part, because of its obvious and facile symbolism: after resisting reform, he was both literally and figuratively flung in front of the fast moving and inevitable engine of change, which symbolized not only the advent of ELH 69 (2002) 223-243 c 2002 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 223</page><page sequence="2">middle-class emancipation, but also the revolution of industrializa- tion, signalled by the new railway system. The head-on collision between literary and historical character in Middlemarch is important, for Eliot criticism has long been divided by divergent interpretive tracks, one which runs along the lines of a kind of Lukacsian march of history, and the other which follows the perhaps slower lines of figurative reading. In Eliot criticism, the political / literary tension manifests itself through the historical / literary distinction, where "history" is frequently substituted for "politics."3 The polarized critical climate surrounding Eliot's work results, in part, from the fundamental misconception of tropological discourse as wholly incompatible with historical and political dis- course. In Eliot's Middlemarch, however, historical and political discourse is inescapably tropological. Tropes, in particular, the trope of personification, allow Eliot to create a world in which the terms associated with the literary are turned into the terms aligned with the historical and political. Like politics, the term history, in both Victorian texts and in current critical theory, is aligned with action and practice.4 Because the related tropes of personification and prosopopeia enable a turn from inanimate to animate, from object to subject, and from description to action, those tropes are central to Eliot's historical turn. In the polarized climate of Eliot criticism, figurative reading tends to emerge as a kind of preindustrial form opposed to the industrial realm of history. Terry Eagleton, for example, argues that Eliot's novel reduces the historical to the literary because "[t]he Reform Bill, the railways, cholera, machine-breaking: these 'real' historical forces do no more than impinge on the novel's margins."5 The forces of industrial revolution, that is, are "real" history, and those forces are contained and reduced by the text. Distinguishing "between the text and the 'real' history to which it alludes" (my emphasis), Eagleton cites Eliot's overarching figure of the web as an exemplary "dehistoricizing" (and therefore depoliticizing) literary structure. In a famous passage in Middlemarch, the web appears as a figure for history itself, when the narrator refers to the novel's form of history as "this particular web" (128). Eagleton writes that "the web's symmetry, its 'spatial' dehistoricizing of the social process, its exclusion of levels of contradiction, preserve the essential unity of the organic mode."6 The metaphor of the web, Eagleton suggests, belongs to a timeless, spatial, rural, organic realm, a realm that he associates with preindustrialism. While Eliot figures history through the metaphor of 224 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="3">the web, Eagleton figures figuration itself as a historical period prior to industrialization. Although history, in Eagleton's formulation, becomes the larger structure containing literature, it is ultimately a metaphor itself and thus both contains and is contained by figuration. What does it mean that Eagleton figures figuration itself as preindustrial? The language of Eagleton's own argument points to the fact that he can conceive of history itself only through figurative form, in terms of a referent / figure structure, where industrialism is a figure for the referentiality (the "real" force of history) and preindustrialism is a figure for figurative language itself. Eliot's Middlemarch is troubling to Eagleton precisely because it suggests what the language of Eagleton's argument unwittingly implies, that it may be impossible to formulate the historical / literary, political / literary distinctions except through tropological discourse. I cite Eagleton's criticism as exemplary of a resistance to the notion that figures and tropes might operate as historical and political forces. The assumption that tropes and figures are inherently incompatible with historical and political discourse marks not only Eagleton's 1978 reading, but also more recent Eliot criticism. Daniel Cottom, for example, argues that Eliot's novels are part of the "cancellation of history" that is the "essence of liberal intellectual discourse." And figurative language, he suggests, is instrumental to that cancellation, for the "process of constructing metaphor through the repression of social reference was the fable of culture in the Victorian age and generally provided the plot of its novels."' Like Eagleton's interven- tion, Cottom's is based on the assumption that literary discourse is essentially tropological, while historical and political discourse is essentially referential and literal. Eliot criticism is marked by some notable attempts to combine the two seemingly divergent critical modes of literary and historico-political analysis. Yet many of these earnest attempts at reconciliation ultimately give priority to either a social / historical reading or a figurative / literary one and thus reinforce the literary / historical impasse." The failure to get beyond the literary / historical impasse is, in part, a result of the failure to throw into question the assumption that literary discourse is inherently tropological, and historical or political discourse inherently referential. I. The train which runs through the center of Middlemarch is a quintessential Eliot figure in its tendency to suddenly switch from literal to figurative tracks. Some time after the unsavory Mr. Raffles Jessie Givner 225</page><page sequence="4">takes his train, he meets up with Mr. Bulstrode and manages to extort money by threatening to expose the history of Bulstrode's fraudulent business. Referring to the inexorable (figurative) train of events that hurtles Bulstrode toward his public humiliation, Eliot writes that "the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on" (564). Like so many of the characters in Middlemarch, Bulstrode has made the mistake of viewing his past as "a dead history, an outworn preparation of the present" (562). Through a prosopopeic turn, Eliot brings his history back to life, so that his memory is "set smarting like a reopened wound," a "still quivering part of himself, bringing shud- ders and bitter flavours and the tinglings of merited shame" (562). Thus, what Eagleton considers to be one of the unambiguously "'real' historical forces," the railway, is turned into a trope, but a trope that is at once literary and historical. If we look for Eliot's more explicit remarks on the problem of history, not in her novels, but in her 1856 review essay, "The Natural History of German Life," we once again encounter the trope of the train through which she articulates her particular vision of history. Formulating the relation between concrete and abstract history, she begins her essay with a commentary on the varying degree of "concrete knowledge" that one word represents for two different people: The word railways, for example, will probably call up, in the mind of a man who is not highly locomotive, the image either of a "Bradshaw," or of the station with which he is most familiar, or of an indefinite length of tram-road; he will alternate between these three images, which represent his stock of concrete acquaintance with railways.' According to Eliot, this non-locomotive man with limited experience of railways will likely view "railways in the abstract" and "may talk of a vast net-work of railways stretching over the globe." But, in the mind of a man who has gained wider experience of the railway through his positions as "a 'navvy,' an engineer, a traveller, a railway director and shareholder," she argues, "the word 'railways' would include all the essential facts in the existence and relations of the thing." And, as she sees it, we should look to this latter man "if we want a railway to be made."'1 For the non-locomotive man, then, the word "railway" is understood through literary operations, through a condensation of images and associations. For the man who has actual "experience" with operating the railway, however, the word is under- stood in terms of the "essential facts" which Eliot views as the foundation of "natural history." What is most significant about Eliot's 226 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="5">formulation of historical discourse is that it depends upon a distinc- tion between describing and acting. The man who has an imagistic, literary understanding of "railway," she suggests, can only describe railways "in the abstract," while the man who understands the "essential facts" can actually make the railway. Eliot's distinction between concretion and abstraction, mapped onto her distinction between simply describing the railway and actually making one, is crucial, for it places her vision of history within a broad tradition that formulates history through a distinction between constative and performative, descriptive and active language. Eliot's literary / historical, constative / performative mapping suggests an unexpected point of intersection between her notion of the historical novel and the Lukiscian formulation of historical literature through the distinction between narration and descrip- tion."1 In his essay, "Narrate or Describe?" Lukaics writes that "[w]hen the artistic literature of a period does not provide actions in which typical characters with a richly developed inner life are tested in practice, the public seeks abstract, schematic substitutes." Lukics's claim is followed by his assertion that such abstraction can be avoided if literature relies more on action than description. "The predomi- nance of description," he writes, "is not only a result but also and simultaneously a cause, the cause of a further divorce of literature from epic significance."12 Like Lukics's cautionary words about literary abstraction, Eliot's essays repudiate literary abstraction as a hindrance to historical realism. Yet there is some ambivalence in Eliot's articulation of the literary / historical relation; her desire for "concrete history" often seems to be at odds with her equally strong desire for a highly figurative history, a history that she describes, in a different context, as "pregnant movements of the past."'3 The figure of pregnancy is worth examination, for it belongs to a personification of temporal, historical movement, a personification that allows her to negotiate the concrete / abstract, action / description, history / literature impasse. Insofar as personification turns an object or thing into a living, moving subject, insofar as it animates the inanimate, it turns description into action. Thus, the figure bridges the two divided realms of Eliot's essay on natural history, the realms of concrete and abstract, constative and performative, literary and historical lan- guage. In her efforts to historicize history, Phillipa Levine points out that, for the Victorians, industrialism was associated with history in such a way that the mechanization of time and measurement became linked Jessie Givner 227</page><page sequence="6">to history as a form of measuring time. Indeed, the figuration of history as a self-regulating machine continues in current criticism, from Eagleton's early vision of industrial history to Judith Newton's reference to the "motor of history." Newton, however, is self- conscious about the figuration of history both as a machine and body. As she notes, the figure of pregnancy is persistent in Victorian narratives about history, and, she suggests, the figure is invoked not only to naturalize but also to feminize the narrative of industrial progress. In McCulloch's 1835 article, "Philosophy of Manufactur- ers," she notes that "qualities dominantly associated with women in nineteenth century representation, such as nature, embodiment, and birth, are also employed at times to familiarize, naturalize, and assign life-giving functions to material and largely machine-based produc- tion." At the same time, however, those naturalizing figures of pregnancy and embodiment are eventually displaced by "machines [that] completely outstrip nature in importance as they begin to intervene in history."14 In Eliot's work, I would argue, we can see a movement that is exactly the opposite of the female embodiment / man-made machine shift which Newton observes in nineteenth- century narratives about history. Eliot's essays and novels literally turn not only man-made machines, but also histories, into bodies, and often, into female bodies. If we return to the figure of the railway in Middlemarch, we can see that pregnancy once again serves the prosopopeic function of bringing history to life. At one point in the novel, when Caleb Garth's surveying of land is increasingly in demand, his maxim, "Business breeds," leads into a passage that continues the breeding figure: And one form of business that was beginning to breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line was to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed in a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to two persons who were dear to him. (502) The business of the railways is linked, via the figure of breeding, to other forms of business in the novel, most notably to Joshua Riggs's obsession with "breeding coins." We are told that Riggs's one ambition is to have "a money-changer's shop on a much-frequented quay" and "to look sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations" (475). 228 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="7">In Eliot's connection between the two figures of breeding, breed- ing machinery and breeding coins, we can also see a point of divergence between two different measurements of history and money. Unlike Riggs, Caleb Garth is incapable of conceptualizing either business or money because he cannot think figuratively; his mind does not exchange land into monetary value. Nor does it translate labour into the figure of breeding coins: he thought very well of all ranks, but he would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such a close contact with "business" as to get often honourably decorated with marks of dust and mortar ... he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but, he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss. (228) We are reminded of Caleb Garth's literal, concrete ties to the land much later, when the narrator tells us, "It must be remembered that by 'business' Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skillful application of labour" (475). So incapable is he of imagining financial transactions that Caleb eventually devotes himself entirely to the "kinds of work which he [can] do without handling capital" (229). Caleb's inability to conceive of capital is, in part, an inability to think figuratively. The understanding of money not for what it is but for what it represents is, after all, what makes possible a money economy. As Walter Benn Michaels has argued, nineteenth-century naturalism is permeated by an anxiety about the abstract, substitutive, represen- tative value of money and by a concomitant fantasy of money returning to nature (in the form of the natural resource of gold).15 Although Michaels's argument is about American naturalism, it could just as easily apply to nineteenth-century British naturist discourse and to Eliot's concept of natural history. The distinction that Michaels makes between the inherent value of "a natural resource like coals or cows" and the representative value of currency is nowhere more apparent than in the nineteenth-century political debates about the railway. If we turn to those political debates, we can see a connection similar to the one that Eliot makes, in her novel, between the increasing circulation of coins (Riggs's "breeding coins") and the expansion of the railway ("the business that was beginning to breed just then"). The recorded minutes of the 1833 House of Commons debate about the Railway Bill, for example, demonstrate that the expansion of the railway is promoted, not because the railway in and of itself has any inherent value (like, for Jessie Givner 229</page><page sequence="8">example, the value of a natural resource), but rather because the railway facilitates the exchange of commodities and money. In his testimony before a select committee of the house, a director of the Stockton and Darlington railway explains that the construction of the railway through his own properties has increased commerce between various locations, which in turn has increased rents, and in turn, increased the value of property: "the rent of the property is increased one-fifth. I let the farm, subject to its being given up on the railroad being made, and I have since received one-fifth additional rent."16 Such testimony is cited in the report as evidence, not of the railway's intrinsic value, but rather as evidence of its role in the abstract circulation of values, for its role in "the increased speed and cheap- ness of communication," and for its "saving of the time and money of those who are compelled by business, or induced by pleasure, to travel." When the railway is praised for increasing land value, it is said to increase, not the intrinsic value of the land, but "the factitious value which tracts of land immediately surrounding the metropolis and large towns acquire from the proximity of the markets" (50). In other words, the railway has no inherent value but rather aquires value only as part of an abstract, substitutive, representative exchange and circulation of values. Indeed, those in favour of the expansion of the railway (railway directors, engineers, and shareholders) promote the railway as a mode of transportation that will increase not only the national circulation of commodities but also international circulation, thus "rendering [the value of agricultural property] in a great measure independent of local circumstances" (50). 17 The desire, expressed in Eliot's essays and fiction, to return to a concrete, natural history, exemplified by an experiential understand- ing of the term "railway," is perhaps a reaction to the increasing expansion of the railway and of commerce as well as to the result of that expansion: the increasingly abstract representation of value. Again and again in Middlemarch, a tension emerges between intrin- sic and representative value, between literal and figurative value. That tension is apparent when Featherstone, suggesting that Fred Vincy will not inherit his land, upbraids Fred for valuing money over land. "God A'mighty sticks to the land," he tells Fred, "But you take the other side. You like Bulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land" (100). By "spekilation," Featherstone means the abstract values of currency and exchange that are alienated from the intrinsic value of natural resources such as land, cows, and coal. Vincy's protests, that he likes neither Bulstsrode nor speculation, 230 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="9">have no effect on Featherstone, who eventually leaves his land, Stone Court, to Joshua Riggs. One of the novel's ironies is that Riggs immediately exchanges the land for money, while Fred Vincy ends up actually working on the land under the supervision of Caleb Garth. The tension between land and money, in Middlemarch, is con- nected, via the railway, to the tension between spatial and temporal, abstract and concrete history. The history of the railway itself intersects both spatially and temporally with the Reform Bill at a point in time where the use value of the land is transformed, by the railway, into exchange value (monetary value), which is in turn transformed into the political value of votes established by the Reform Bill. That temporal intersection between the beginning of the railway system and the appearance of the Reform Bill is made explicit when Eliot writes that, at that time in Middlemarch, "railways were as excitable a topic as the Reform Bill" (502). While the railway coincides with the time period of the Reform Bill, the Bill itself hinges on the commercial valuation of the land. As the arguments between Caleb Garth and the labourers suggest, the railway is controversial because it detracts from the intrinsic value of the land and natural resources at the same time that it increases the commer- cial traffic through the land, and thus, increases property value for the landholder. Protesting the surveying of land for the railways, one of the labourers, Mr. Solomon, says to Caleb, "Traffic is what they put fo'ard; but it's to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long- run" (502). The Reform Bill is equally controversial because it ties property value to political power: it gives the vote only to those who pay 10 pounds or more in property tax. The "breeding coins" which circulate throughout Eliot's text are thus changed into "the minting of Tory votes" (455). Not only does the emergent railway system create a new evalua- tion of land, but it also produces a new evaluation of time, for it speeds business up so that time can be saved.'8 Yet the railway's role in speeding up industrialization also ensures that time is more readily spent. As Phillipa Levine observes, the changing measurement of time, produced in part by the advent of the railway, changed the Victorian concept of history. "The radical alteration in perceptions of time and speed," inaugurated by improved travel and communica- tion, she notes, brought with it a new respect for history as "the intellectual mechanism whereby time could be measured and evalu- ated."'19 The increasingly easy equation between time and money (as quantities that can be saved and spent), and its impact on the Jessie Givner 231</page><page sequence="10">measurement of "history," are the subjects of a much cited passage in Middlemarch: Fielding lived when the days were longer (for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer afternoons were spacious and the clock ticked slowly in the winter evenings. We belated historians must not linger after his example; and if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as if delivered from a camp-stool in a parrot-house. I at least have so much to do in unravelling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe. (128) There has been no shortage of critical ink spilled on the subject of Eliot's metaphor of the web, particularly as it relates to the literary and historical. For Eagleton, we have seen, the figure of the web is an example of Eliot's reduction of history to literary form. More recent criticism, however, has read the passage as an affirmation of the reciprocity between historical and literary discourse. Yet the critical assumption remains that figurative and tropological discourse, in this instance, as it is manifested by the metaphor of the web, is intrinsi- cally ahistorical and thus must be shown to be compatible with history or to insert itself in history.20 The passage, however, has consistently been misread, for the "particular web" is a product of the specifically Victorian conception of history articulated by Levine, a history influenced "by an increasingly quantitative approach to work and leisure governed far more by clocks and public time."21 Accord- ing to the narrator, it is because we are no longer in the era of spacious summer afternoons, because the clock is ticking faster, that the "particular web" is the most appropriate form for the novel's historical realism. Even within the strictures of Eagleton's definition of history as the forces of industrialization, Eliot's trope of the web turns out to be intrinsic to history. It is not simply that Eliot's passage on history articulates the particular web as a product of the forces of industrialization, but also that weaving, textile production itself, emerges, in the Victorian era, as a form radically altered by the industrial revolution. The work of weaving moves from the domestic space of the drawing room to the industrial arena of the factories, the cotton mills, flax mills, and woollen mills. For those who would insist on a strict demarcation of literary and historical discourse, the trope 232 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="11">of the web is a source of anxiety perhaps because it suggests the way in which textuality and figuration might be inherently historical. The constellation of figurative, historical, commercial, and indus- trial (relations) can be seen in those passages in Middlemarch where figurative transactions turn out to inhabit commercial and industrial transactions. When Fred Vincy copies "figures" for Farebrother's evaluation of land, the word "figure" itself undergoes an exchange between language and money. Vincy, who has chosen land surveying over "desk-work," is alarmed to discover that his employer, Caleb Garth, expects him to translate the results of his physical labour into letters and numbers. Because he has not been trained in handwriting, he feels "an awkward movement of the heart" when Caleb hands him the pen and says, "Copy me a line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end" (515). Eliot describes the formation of those figures in detail: At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to write legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred wrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any viscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the consonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had a blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line-in short, it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you know beforehand what the writer means. (515) This passage is characteristic of the close tangle of commercial and textual transaction throughout Eliot's work.22 In the case of Fred Vincy's handwriting, money emerges as a metaphor for metaphoricity itself via his figures: the word "figures" refers both to his numbers and letters, and those figures in turn represent the monetary value of the land. What is striking about the passage, however, is the ambigu- ity of the word "figure," as it slides between literal and figurative quantities. When the term is used in one of its most literal senses, to mean numbers, it is nonetheless an abstraction; the literal figures become numbers that abstract, that represent the measurements and value of the land, whose value is in turn converted into a whole network of other values, from that of votes determined by the property tax to the elusive value of reputation that is attached to the landed class. When the word "figure" refers to Fred's letters, it would seem to convey the most literal (or letteral) sense of the term. Indeed, it is worth noting that the very word "figure" has a contradictory etymo- logical direction, pointing at once to the opaque form of language and Jessie Givner 233</page><page sequence="12">to its oppositional other, transparent content. As the OED tells us, "figure" refers both to the literal or letteral ("a letter of the alphabet, the symbol of a musical note, a mathematical symbol") as well as to the rhetorical and tropological ("any of the various 'forms' of expres- sion, deviating from the normal arrangement or use of words ... e.g. Aposiopesis, Hyperbole, Metaphor, etc."). It refers at once to the body ("Of a living being: Bodily shape") and to the representation of the bodies and matter ("The image, likeness, or representation of something material or immaterial"). In this passage on handwriting, Eliot exploits the contradictory meaning of figure as both literal letters and figurative form, for even Fred's literal letters are given a figurative turn; they are in such a messy handwriting that they become unreadable, "easy to interpret" only "when you know before- hand what the writer means" (515). At the same time that his letters lose their referential meaning, they gain a figurative one through the personification of the unreadable vowels and consonants, as gentle- manly letters that "disdained to keep the line" (515). Fred Vincy's unreadable figures, written in a hand "as gentlemanly as that of any viscount or bishop" (515), recall an earlier passage in which aristocratic gentility is inscribed in figurative language. After mentioning the unseemly character of Joshua Riggs, the narrator explains that "if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought into view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more than figuratively ungenteel" (309). Finally, she concludes, the low truth about "petty sums" may be raised "to the level of high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of proportional ciphers" (309). The position of figurative language in this instance is part of the narrator's larger meditation on history. In fact, the paragraph begins, not with figures as a means of elevating low sums, but with "[h]istorical parallels" as "the means of elevating a low subject" (309). But such "historical parallels" present a problem, Eliot writes, for "the diligent narrator may lack space, or (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of them with any degree of particularity" (309). What is to be done when history is disabled by this lack of space and particularity? According to the narrator, the figurative form of parables offers one solution, "since there never was a true story which could not be told in parables" (309). And these facts, "ennobled by being considered a parable," will then be only "figuratively ungenteel" (309). The problem of history thus emerges once more as part of the problematic relation between the value of literal and figurative 234 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="13">language. The ironic tone here further complicates a narrative interlude that is already tangled in the figurative knot of metaphor and money. When read literally, the narrator's remarks might be taken to mean that figuration is unambiguously aligned with money (both old and new). But the ironic turn of the passage suggests that the novel's figurative language is anything but a merely decorative, "genteel" form that clothes the raw material of concrete history. For Eliot, figurative language is neither an erasure of history nor an ennobling outer form but rather the very content of history's form. That historical form appears in Eliot's images of handwriting. How does handwriting escape beyond the bounded lines that would keep it neatly within the bounded lines of concrete, literal history? I will suggest handwriting flows between the literal / figurative, historical / literary borders, in part, as it is exchanged into another word that is a synonym for handwriting, "character." II. Eliot's detailed development of character has long been held up as the defining element of her novels' historical realism."2 For J. Hillis Miller, "the fullness of characterization" in Middlemarch makes the novel "perhaps the masterwork of Victorian realism."24 Indeed, in her letters, Eliot herself stresses the centrality of character to realism. We will see that character is, in fact, one of the most destabilizing forces in her work, an element which exists on the faultline between literature and history and which produces an unpredictable shifting of the very grounds of fiction. That instability arises whenever Eliot's work approaches the problem of the false dichotomy between passive description and active narration. When it is used in its most obvious sense to classify Eliot's work as realist, character refers to a protago- nist whose psychological processes are consistent with her actions. Such is the sense of the word implied by Eliot when she writes, in a letter to John Blackwood, "I am unable to alter anything in relation to the delineation or development of character, as my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae."25 Much later, in a letter praising the realism of Middlemarch, Blackwood writes to Eliot, "In all this life like gallery that you put before us every trait in every character finds an echo or recollection in the reader's mind that tells him how true it is to Nature.""26 I want to turn, at this point, from Eliot's character development (where character refers to an individual protagonist) to the development of the very word, "character," as it shifts in her text through variegated shades of literal Jessie Givner 235</page><page sequence="14">and figurative meaning and eventually floats free from its referential moorings. In Middlemarch, character makes its first appearance in the form of Casaubon's literal, decaying history. When Sir James, chirping up about history at a dinner party, asks his guest if he has read Southey's multivolumed history of the Peninsular War, Casaubon cursorily dismisses the subject: I have little leisure for such literature now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect reader. It is a misfortune in some senses: I feed too much on the inward sources; I live too much with the dead. (13) The word "character" here points in two directions, referring to the literal typographical characters read by Casaubon and later on dutifully copied by Dorothea, and to the characters (individual subjects) who populate Casaubon's history. But Casaubon himself later becomes a character whom Dorothea reads, first in a very literal sense and then in a more abstract one. Believing that Casaubon will come to understand the debt owed to Ladislaw, Dorothea tells Ladislaw, "The great strength of his character lies here" (339). After Casaubon's death, she recognizes her "subjection" to a husband "whose exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character" (450). Dorothea's subjection is literally inscribed in her copying of characters, and her release from that subjection, accompanied by her own increasingly strong subjectivity, manifests itself in her formation of characters. Several months after Dorothea marries Casaubon and agrees to copy characters for him, one of the many arguments of their marriage produces its emotional after-effects in Casaubon's handwriting: Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his writing, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be written in an unknown character. (258) When Dorothea sits down to write, immediately after their argu- ment, her hand does not tremble but rather produces strong charac- ters, "forming her letters beautifully" (258). The contrast between Casaubon's spidery, unrecognizable characters and Dorothea's strong, beautifully formed ones accompanies their increasingly divergent conceptions of history. As the novel progresses, Casaubon's history 236 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="15">becomes a compilation of "old characters," dead letters whose cumulative dead weight ultimately drags him down to his own untimely death. Dorothea eventually loses interest in copying Casaubon's dead historical characters and begins to recognize the limits of that history during her visit to Rome, "the city of visible history, where the past of a whole hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral images and trophies from afar" (176). When she visits the galleries, basilicas, and palaces, she sees "the dimmer yet eager life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings," where "all that was living and warm-blooded [seems] sunk in the deep degeneracy of a superstition" (177). Dorothea's recogni- tion of this degenerating history marks the beginning of her release from the dead weight of Casaubon's tomb of history, "The Key to All Mythologies." After Casaubon's death, Dorothea comes to under- stand history as a fully personified form. The alienation of Casaubon's typographical characters from the individual characters (historical subjects) to which they refer is conveyed largely through Eliot's prosopopeic turns. Earlier in the novel, Mrs. Cadwallader jokes that someone put a drop of Casaubon's blood "under a magnifying-glass, and it was all semicolons and parentheses" (62). While this prosopopeic joke drains Casaubon of life, it also animates the typographical mark of the semicolon, through the familiar figurative flow of ink into blood."2 Such passages point to what Neil Hertz, among others, observes is the ease with which characters (in the sense of fictional protagonists) become "texts or clusters of signs." The personifications involved, he notes, "exist somewhere between realistically represented persons and configurations of signs.""28 What I want to suggest here is that personification, in Middlemarch, also functions as a middle ground between the two terms that Eliot and her critics find so difficult to reconcile: literature and history. In fact, the word "character" is the site of a whole cluster of personifications that turn on various distinctions between historical and literary representation, from the characters of Farebrother's "Natural History" to the characters (protagonists) of the narrator's meditations on narrative to the characters of Rosamond's frivolous and trivial understanding of history. A microscopic form of historical character emerges in Farebrother's "Natural History." As the OED tells us, one of the several meanings of character is that used "in Natural History. One of the distinguish- ing features of a species of genus." Interestingly, the double meaning Jessie Givner 237</page><page sequence="16">of character as a linguistic sign and as a feature of a natural species is one that Darwin makes use of in his natural history when he writes that we have "no pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have long been inher- ited." As Gillian Beer notes, the term character in this passage shifts from a semiological meaning ("armorial bearings") to a natural historical one.29 That same instability in the word's meaning can be seen in Eliot's portrayal of Farebrother's collection of species. We first encounter the characters of Farebrother's Natural History when he takes Lydgate into his study to view his collection of meticulously ordered fauna and flora. Explaining his obsession with entymological species to Lydgate, Farebrother tells him: You don't know what it is to want spiritual tobacco-bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a variety of Aphis brassicae, with the well-known signature of Philomicron, for the Twaddler's Magazine; or a learned treatise on the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not mentioned, but probably met with by the Isrealites in their passage through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant. (157) The dead characters in his collection of "pickled vermin and drawers full of blue-bottles and moths" (156) don't remain pinned down to their most concrete realm for the duration of the novel but rather float free from their boxed containers and circulate as figurative forms for Eliot's characters (protagonists): Casaubon's soul becomes an injured moth, "fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking of its wings and never flying" (254), and Will Ladislaw cannot resist giving "another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon's glory" (331). At one point, all the characters in the novel shrink into the microscopic form of insects, particularly when gossip spreads through Middlemarch and news is "dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen which the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when they are buzzing in search of their particular nectar" (546). In spite of his preoccupation with the minute, concrete characters of his Natural History, Farebrother also concerns himself with more abstract and figurative forms of character, insisting at one point that Dorothea is taking the notion of character (in the sense of reputation) too literally. After Lydgate's reputation has been destroyed by rumours of his collaboration with Bulstrode's fraudulent and homicidal deeds, 238 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="17">Dorothea pleads with Mr. Farebrother for a restoration of Lydgate's character. "[T]here is a man's character to speak for him," she says to Farebrother, who replies, "But my dear Mrs. Casaubon ... character is not cut in marble-it is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do" (672). Dorothea picks up his figure, concluding that if character is living, "then it may be restored and healed" (672). This prosopopeic flow of one character into another, from microscopic characters to telescopic ones, from dead characters to living ones, extends beyond Middlemarch, so that the novel's characters flow into the characters of Eliot's letters and essays and finally into the character of Eliot herself.30 Like Eliot's readers and critics, the characters within Middlemarch read each other as representatives of literary, political, and historical traditions. To Dorothea, Casaubon is a personification of history. But to Casaubon, Dorothea represents all that is outside of his historical volumes and all that threatens his identity as an author. We are told that "Dorothea was not only his wife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds the ill-appreciated or desponding author" (184). This reading of one character by another is enabled by the same operation that allows George Eliot to stand in for social communities and great literary traditions: personification. In order for one character to read another as a text, the character reading must herself move beyond the merely textual. She must come to life as a character who is above the text and thus can identify the character she reads as one who is reduced to text. It is this slippery movement between characters that allows Dorothea to bleed into the historical character of Saint Theresa and that allows both those figures to bleed into the character of George Eliot. Dorothea, Saint Theresa, and George Eliot converge at the end of Middlemarch in a final passage which provides no closure to the literature / history problem. The two categories of literature and history are once again joined at the seams of words and deeds. This time, however, the alignment between history and action is broken when the narrator remarks upon Dorothea's "unhistoric acts" (766). After noting that the era which would allow for a "new Theresa" has passed, the narrator goes on to say that "we insignificant people with out daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas" (766). The paragraph concludes with the observation that the good of the world is partly dependent on such "unhistoric acts." This refer- ence to the seventeenth-century nun in the frame of the novel makes a connection not only between Dorothea and Saint Theresa, but also Jessie Givner 239</page><page sequence="18">between George Eliot and Saint Theresa. The historical reference framing the novel draws attention to the temporal convergence of Eliot's own act of writing the novel in 1870 with the church's recognition of Saint Theresa's acts. By moving the novel outward to this historical frame, the concluding paragraph locates Eliot's Middlemarch in the realm of both historic and unhistoric acts.

Hereafter cited parenthetically by page number. 2 Linda Colley, Britons: Forging The Nation 1701-1837 (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1992), 334-35. 3 Terry Eagleton, for example, argues that the "ideological matrix" of Eliot's work is "set by the increasingly corporate character of Victorian capitalism and its political apparatus." Eliot's fiction, he suggests, reduces history to literature and therefore reduces politics to literature. See Eagleton's Criticism and Ideology: A Study in Marxist Literary Theory (London: Verso, 1978), 120. Daniel Cottom similarly aligns the historical and political in his study of George Eliot. Suggesting an incompatibility between Eliot's figurative discourse and historical / political discourse, Cottom asserts that "social forms or institutions do not play a mediating role" in Eliot's plots, because "[h]er resolutions happen only figuratively, or in the minds and emotions of those characters who are brought to an approximation of the figural consciousness of her narrators," Social Figures: George Eliot, Social History, and Literary Represen- tation (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1987), 28. "[Literature's] reference and meaning," he concludes, "can be determined only in terms of the historical and political conditions of its existence" (214, my emphases). The definition of history as politics also marks nineteenth century texts. Thomas Carlyle, for example, defines history as the memory of "the whole fortunes of one little inward kingdom, and all its politics, foreign, and domestic" ("On History," in English and Other Critical Essays [London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1950], 80). 4 Carlyle, for example, thus defines "History" as "all Action" ("On History," 90). As we have seen, history, in twentieth-century criticism and theory, is persistently aligned with action. Lukaics's famous distinction between narration and description rests on the distinction between action and description. The properly historical novel, for Lukics, is one of action, for "only in activity do men become interesting to each other." See Georg Lukacs's "Narrate or Describe?" in Writer and Critic and Other Essays, ed. and trans. Arthur Kahn (London: Merlin Press, 1978), 123. In current critical theory, history is similarly associated with action. Eagleton, for example, associates the "flight from real history" in some forms of literary theory as synonymous with a flight from "political action." See Eagleton's "Political Criticism," in Literary Theory: An Introduction (Minneapolis: The Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1996), 171, 179, 187. 5 Eagleton, Criticism, 120. 6 Eagleton, Criticism, 120. 7 Cottom, 25, 9. 240 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="19">8 In one of the earliest examinations of Eliot's combination of aesthetics and historicism, Avrom Fleishman describes Eliot's work as an "esthetic equivalent of that strain of historicism which views individual action in the context of the social organism." See Fleishman's The Historical Novel: Walter Scott to Virginia Woolf (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1971), 158. For an early deconstructive reading of the problematic relationship between literature and history in Middlemarch, see J. Hillis Miller's "Narrative and History," ELH 41 (1974): 455-73. Mark Seltzer's intervention in the literature / history problem is an exception in its combination of what he terms "the apparently incompatible claims of a radical formalism and a radical historicism." See Seltzer, "Statistical Persons," Diacritics 17 (1987): 92. Seltzer uses personification in order to illuminate a body-machine complex, arguing that "in the discourse of realism, having a character is precisely to internalize, personify, or embody the social" (86). He thus articulates a close fit between "the at once physical and immaterial act of putting letters and words on paper and the powerfully animating or animistic effects of this act" (91). In his study of modernism, Tony Jackson also tries to reconcile a literary / deconstructive approach with a social / historical one, bringing a psychoanalytic reading together with a Lukaicsian historical one. See The Subject of Modernism: Narrative Alterations in the Fiction of Eliot, Conrad, Woolf, and Joyce (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1994). In her discussion of history and the Victorian novel, Christina Crosby departs from the conventional mapping of literary figures onto commodity fetishism and argues instead that nineteenth-century history itself functioned as a commodity fetish (see "Reading the Gothic Revival: 'History' and Hints on Household Taste," in Rewriting The Victorians, ed. Linda Shires [New York: Routledge, 1992], 102). Crosby also expresses her resistance to "'history' as teleology, as totality," in The Ends of History: Victorians and "The Woman Question" (New York: Routledge, 1991), 147. As its title suggests, Cottom's Social Figures tries to bring together a figurative and social / historical analysis. Cottom, however, aligns Eliot's figurative language with her conservatism and her erasure of social history. See Cottom, 25. As Kathryn Stockton notes, Eliot did indeed subscribe to the positivist philosophies with which Cottom quite rightly associates her work. But Stockton disagrees with Cottom's characteriza- tion of Eliot as a bourgeois humanist and a "figure of patriarchy" and argues that Cottom himself "repeats a 'bourgeois' masculine move" by overlooking Eliot's own difficult position as a woman writer whose male pseudonym enabled the acceptance and success of her work. As Stockton notes, Barbara Bodichon, who campaigned for women's right to work, was one of Eliot's closest friends and may have been the model for the central character of Middlemarch's Dorothea Brook. See Stockton's God Between Their Lips: Desire Between Women in Irigaray, Bronte, and Eliot (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1994), 175, 83. In contrast to Cottom, Bert Hornack views Middlemarch, above all, as a social, historical work, "a novel of reform," but, like Cottom, he suggests that an emphasis on figurative language and text is incompatible with an analysis of social history. Deconstructive critics, he comments, have "appropriated Middlemarch" in order to read, "not George Eliot's novel but its 'text."' He goes on to cite approvingly Kerry McSweeney's assertion that such deconstructive criticism "is excessively engagd and ideological, too concerned with its own premises, methods, and self-delighting excruciations, and insufficiently disinterested in George Eliot's novel."

In his essay, "Narrate or Describe?" he writes that "[w]hen the artistic literature of a period does not provide actions in which typical characters with a richly developed inner life are tested in practice, the public seeks abstract, schematic substitutes" (124). 12 Lukics, 127. 13 Her reference to "pregnant movements of the past" appears in her remarks under the heading "Historic Imagination," collected in "Leaves from a Note-book," in Essays of George Eliot, 447. 14 Judith Newton, "Engendering History for the Middle Class: Sex and Political Economy in the Edinburgh Review," in Rewriting the Victorians, 12. 15 Walter Benn Michaels, The Gold Standard and The Logic of Naturalism: American Literature at The Turn of the Century (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1987), 146. 16 "Minutes of Evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons on the London and Birmingham Railway Bill," Edinburgh Review 61 (1834): 47. 17 Edinburgh Review 61 (1834): 52 ("increased speed"; "saving"), 50 ('factitious value"; "rendering"). 18 In his discussion of "railway novels," Nicholas Daly observes that the emergence of the railway system coincides with modernity in general and with a "modernization of the senses" in particular. For the Victorians, Daly notes, the railway "stood as both agent and icon of the acceleration of the pace of everday life; it annihilated an older experience of time and space, and made new demands on the sensorium of the traveler" ("Railway Novels: Sensation Fiction and The Modernization of The Senses," ELH 66 [1999]: 463). 19 Phillipa Levine, The Amateur and The Professional: Antiquarians, Historians, and Archeologists in Victorian England, 1838-1886 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986), 3. 20 Two of the most compelling readings of Eliot's web as both literary and historical can be found in Marc Redfield's Phantom Formations: Aesthetic Ideology and the Bildungsroman (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1996), and David Ferris's Theory and The Evasion of History (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1993). Ferris, for example, reads the web as an "unbinding bond" between literary and historical discourse. Ultimately, however, he concludes that "[n]ot only is the bind always unbound in this model but history is itself denied as it becomes what never happened" (189-90). Interestingly, Ferris maps the literary / historical distinction onto a constative / performative one, when he writes that "what we call history would be as strange to Cyrus as language would be to an act or an event" (190). As I have been arguing, the prosopopeic and anthropomorphic formulations of history in Eliot's essays and novels are precisely what make such distinctions impossible. In his reading of Middlemarch, Redfield argues that the novel opens up the possibility of "aesthetic history" (138). Connecting Eliot's metaphor of the web to Lydgate's histology and thus to the web of bodily tissue, Redfield writes that "[h]istory, inscribing itself within bodies, is itself a body to the extent that the metaphors of web and current convey a promise of telos and form, and to the extent that 'unhistoric acts' can be absorbed into history just as unperceived sensations or 242 Industrial History, Preindustrial Literature</page><page sequence="21">unacknowledged meanings are recorded by the embodied self" (141). Redfield, that is, demonstrates the way "the body tropes the insertion of the self into the larger intentional structure of history" (141). My own intervention owes much to Redfield's analysis, and my reading of the web is intended to suggest the possibility that tropological structure itself is inherently historical. 21 Levine, 3. 22 Neil Hertz traces an interlocking of textual and commercial figures both in Eliot's fictional and non-fictional work. Hertz concludes that Eliot's figures of "unrelieved debt are figures not just for the gestation of her fictions but also for the gerundive time (the time of owing, or of dying) over which their peculiar life-in-debt is extended" ("George Eliot's Life-in-Debt," Diacritics 25 [1995]: 70). 23 Catherine Belsey, for example, finds Eliot's characters to be exemplary of the "classic realist text" (Critical Practice [New York: Methuen, 1980], 73). 24 Hillis Miller, "Optic and Semiotic in Middlemarch," in The Worlds of Victorian Fiction, ed. Jerome Buckley (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1975), 127. 25 Selections from George Eliot's Letters, ed. Gordon S. Haight (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1985), 165. 26 The George Eliot Letters, ed. Gordon S. Haight, 7 vols. (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1968), 5:167. 27 Mark Seltzer provides a very detailed analysis of the body-machine complex and its manifestation in the blood-ink pattern of personification. The personification of literal text through the blood-ink relation, he argues, is part of the identification of realist discourse, an identification that "involves the perfect 'fit' between the ontology of writing and the specific material-the historically specific subject- matter-of the social body-machine complex, the perfect 'fit' betwen the (apparently non-historicizable) ontology of writing and a historically specific biomechanics" (92). 2" Hertz, "Recognizing Casaubon," Glyph: Textual Studies 6 (1979): 78. 29 Charles Darwin as quoted from Gillian Beer, Darwin's Plots: Evolutionary Narrative in Darwin, George Eliot, and Nineteenth-Century Fiction (London: Routledge, 1983), 63. 30 When Eliot and Lewes were vacationing at Ilfracombe in the summer of 1856, they amassed a collection of microscopic species almost identical in its character(s) to Farebrother's collection of species. In a letter to Charles Bray, Eliot describes her room at Ilfracombe "decked with yellow pie-dishes, afootpan, glass jars and phials, all full of zoophytes or molluscs or annelides." The journal Eliot kept during her visit records the various characters collected, their excitement over "the discovery of this little red Mesembryanthemum," and their delight at finding "the pale fawn coloured tentacles of an Anthea Cereus viciously waving like little serpents" (The trip to Ilfracombe is described in The George Eliot Letters, 2:252-53). These species of Natural History provide the overarching metaphor for the review essay that Eliot was writing at the time of the Ilfracombe visit, the "Natural History" review that begins with the concrete and abstract train. In the essay, Eliot structures her argument about the history / literature relation through the relation between natural and metaphorical, concrete and abstract character. What is needed, Eliot argues, is a historical language that conveys its naturalism through literary resonances, a language that grows "in precision, completeness, and unity, as minds grow in clearness, comprehensiveness, and sympathy." Such naturalism, she concludes, should enable an understanding of history on the order of the complexity of Natural History where "your particular society of zoophytes, mollusks, and echinoderms may feel themselves, as the Germans say, at ease in their skin" ("Natural History," 288).
