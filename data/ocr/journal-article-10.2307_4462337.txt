A longitudinal study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of osteopenia or osteoporosis in HIV-infected persons; to assess bone mineralization, metabolism, and histomorphometry over time; and to evaluate predisposing factors. A total of 128 patients enrolled the study, and 93 were observed for 72 weeks. "Classic" risk factors (low body mass index, history of weight loss, steroid use, and smoking) for low bone mineral density (BMD) and duration of HIV infection were strongly associated with osteopenia. There was a weak association between low BMD and receipt of treatment with protease inhibitors; this association disappeared after controlling for the above factors. Markers of bone turnover tended to be elevated in the whole cohort but were not associated with low BMD. BMD increased slightly during follow-up. Traditional risk factors and advanced HIV infection play a more significant pathogenic role in the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis associated with HIV infection than do treatment-associated factors. The use of HAART has resulted in a significant reduc- tion in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. HIV in- fection and HAART have been associated with the de- velopment of numerous acute and long-term toxicities [1-10], with pathogeneses that are still under scrutiny [3-10]. Recently, several bone disorders, including premature osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis, have been Received 4 June 2002; accepted 2 October 2002; electronically published 29 January 2003.

The under- lying mechanisms that account for these findings and any relation to use of antiretroviral medications have yet to be defined. Multiple factors associated with al- terations in bone metabolism have been postulated, in- cluding the use of protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside- related mitochondrial toxicity and/or lactic acidosis, development of lipodystrophy, immune reconstitution, nutritional and hormonal factors, prior AIDS-related wasting, and HIV infection itself [12-14, 16-20]. Given the likely multifactorial nature of the various bone disorders previously described in HIV-infected persons, we sought to provide a more comprehensive characterization of the bone mineralization, metabo- lism, and morphology in the HIV-infected population and of how these changes in bone evolve over time. The objectives of our study were to estimate the prev- alence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART; to assess bone mineraliza- tion, metabolism, and histomorphometry over an ex- 482 * CID 2003:36 (15 February) * HIV/AIDS</page><page sequence="2">tended period of time; and to assess factors associated with osteopenia or osteoporosis in affected persons. PATIENTS AND METHODS Design. Originally, the research design was conceived as a cross-sectional study to evaluate bone metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected patients recruited from the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit and the Infectious Diseases Out- patient Clinic at Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis). We subsequently expanded the study into a lon- gitudinal analysis of the evolution of BMD and parameters of bone metabolism during a 72-week time period (figure 1). All patients from the original cross-sectional cohort were invited to participate. The study was approved by the Human Studies Committee of the Washington University Medical Center. Baseline and follow-up studies. At baseline, sociodemo- graphic and clinical data were obtained, as was as a detailed 3- day dietary intake history (including vitamin D, calcium, caf- feine, alcohol, and average energy intake) and medication history (including type and duration of all antiretroviral therapy and past use of any medications that may potentially alter bone metabolism). Anthropomorphic data included body mass index (BMI) and dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry, which were measured at 6-month intervals. Serum and 24-h urine bone markers (levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, 25(OH) vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, urine calcium, pyridinolines, and deoxypyridinolines) were measured for all patients at 6-month intervals. Transiliac bone biopsy with dual oxytetracycline bone labeling was performed for 7 patients who consented to the biopsy procedure. BMD measurements. A Hologic QDR-2000 enhanced- array, whole-body, dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry scanner and software, version 5.71A, were used to measure whole-body lean, adipose, and bone mass [21]. Regional array software, version 4.74A:1 (Hologic), was used to determine BMD of the whole body, lumbar spine (L1-L4), and proximal femur. Laboratory measurements. Serum bone alkaline phos- phatase levels were measured with use of the Chemical Inhi- bition and Differential Inactivation assay (Mayo Medical Lab- oratories) with normal reference intervals of 24-146 U/L. Serum intact osteocalcin levels were measured with the chemi- luminoimmunoassay (Mayo Medical Laboratories) with nor- mal reference intervals of 2-15 mg/L. After 21 June 2000, an RIA was used by Mayo Medical Laboratories (normal reference interval, 8-52 ng/mL). Urine pyridinoline and deoxypyridi- noline levels were measured with the Pyridinoline-Deoxypyr- idinoline U high-pressure liquid chromatography assay (Mayo Medical Laboratories) with normal reference intervals of 18-40 Original cross-sectional study n =128 Excluded Analyzed at baseline n=3 n=125 Bone biopsy [ n=7 r Longitudinal follow-up n=93 Excluded (started alendronate) n =3 Figure 1.

Because of the diurnal variation of cros- slink excretion, only the morning's first urine samples were used. Intact parathyroid hormone levels were measured with use of the Immulite Intact Parathyroid Hormone kit (Diag- nostic Products Corporation; normal reference range, 12-72 pg/mL in serum). 25(OH) vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 levels were measured with an RIA (DiaSorin). Normal values fluctuate from 22 to 67 pg/mL, depending on the subjects' exposure to sun. All other laboratory tests were done by a central laboratory (Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis). Bone biopsies. Subjects who consented to undergo tran- siliac bone biopsy received two 3-day courses of tetracycline (250 mg q.i.d.) separated by a 10-day interval. On the third day after the last dose, a bone biopsy was done under local anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The biopsy core specimen was placed in 70% ethanol for &gt;48 h. The specimen was de- hydrated, defatted, embedded, and sectioned on the basis of a published method and evaluated with fluorescent microscopy in the Johns Hopkins Bone Histomorphometry Laboratory (Baltimore). Measures of trabecular bone (TB/bone volume [BV]), bone surface (BS), eroded surface (ES/BS), osteoid sur- face (OS/BS), mineralization surface (MS/BS), wall thickness, osteoid thickness, and mineral apposition rate were made. HIV/AIDS * CID 2003:36 (15 February) * 483</page><page sequence="3">Definitions. Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined on the basis of World Health Organization criteria [22]. Patients with a BMD t score between -1 and -2.5 were categorized as having osteopenia, and patients with a BMD t score less than or equal to -2.5 were categorized as having osteoporosis. Phys- ical activity level was defined as "moderate" if the patient per- formed &gt;30 min of an activity equivalent to brisk walking or jogging &gt;3 times per week, as "high," if brisk activity was performed for &gt;30 min &gt;5 times per week, and "low," if min- imal to no physical activity was performed. Low calcium intake was defined as an average ingestion of &lt;1000 mg/day on the basis of a 3-day dietary intake history. Current or past excessive alcohol intake was defined as having a current or past average alcohol intake of &gt;2 drinks per day. Patients with a past doc- umented weight loss of &gt;10% of their ideal body weight (since acquiring HIV infection) were considered to have a history of wasting. Patients with a nadir BMI of &lt;20 kg/m2 during their follow-up since infection were categorized as having a history of severe wasting. Exposure to drugs was calculated by the number of days or weeks receiving an antiretroviral agent. In the case of dual-PI or dual-nucleoside combinations, each drug was considered independently. Duration of HIV infection was defined as the time difference between enrollment in the trial and the first documented HIV-positive test result. Statistical analysis. Comparisons between categorical groups were done with use of x2 and Fisher's exact tests. Stu- dent's t test was used for continuous variables. All P values were 2-tailed. Partial correlations testing was done to estimate the strength of association between various clinical and labo- ratory characteristics. Potential predictors of osteopenia or changes in BMD were further evaluated for statistical signifi- cance by multiple regression analysis. Evolution of BMD over time was evaluated by one-way, repeated-measures, within- subject analysis of variance, with the factor being the number of weeks of follow-up. As the result was significant, pairwise comparisons between each time point and baseline were done. The levels of significance for multiple comparisons were cor- rected by the Bonferroni procedure. Data were analyzed with use of the SPSS software package (SPSS/Systat). RESULTS Baseline Cross-Sectional Study Clinical characteristics. A total of 128 patients were recruited for the original cross-sectional study (table 1). Three patients were subsequently excluded from all statistical analyses: 1 pa- tient was a clear outlier with a BMI of &gt;50, dual-energy ra- diographic absorptiometry was not performed for 1 patient, and 1 patient was an outlier with a t score of -5.89 (this patient subsequently had severe osteomalacia secondary to phosphate wasting diagnosed while receiving treatment with foscarnet). Ninety-three of the remaining 125 patients agreed to be ob- served longitudinally. The majority of the patients were male (86%), white (84%), and currently taking a PI-based HAART regimen (68%). Sev- enty percent had an undetectable virus load, and the mean duration of HIV infection was 76.9 months. The mean age of the cohort was 42 years, with mean current and nadir CD4 T cell counts of 516 cells/mm3 and 236 cells/mm3. The mean durations of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, PI, and nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor therapies were 349, 135, and 33 weeks, respectively. Although the mean current weight (75.3 kg) and BMI (25.1) were typical, a large percentage of subjects had a history of significant weight loss (27%) and severe wasting (14%). Many patients also had other known risks for low BMD, including current or past tobacco use (35%), low activity level (55%), and calcium intake less than the US recommended daily al- lowance (70%). Laboratory characteristics. Among the cohort of patients, the mean serum levels of total testosterone, parathyroid hor- mone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, phosphorus, vitamin D, cholesterol, and triglycerides were within normal ranges for both osteopenic and nonosteopenic patients (table 2). Bone- specific markers, including serum osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urine pyridinoline levels, were frequently el- evated in both groups. Mean 24-h urine calcium excretion and ionized calcium levels were also higher than expected. There were no statistically significant differences in any laboratory parameter between osteopenic and nonosteopenic groups. Prevalence and features of bone abnormalities at the time of enrollment. At baseline, a total of 57 patients (46%) had osteopenia or osteoporosis, as determined on the basis of World Health Organization criteria. Median lumbar and hip BMD t scores were -0.92 (interquartile range, -0.3 to -1.7) and -0.95 (interquartile range, -0.2 to -1.6), respectively. Seven patients consented to undergo transiliac bone biopsy. Bone histomorphologic results were categorized into 4 distinct groups. Group 1 (1 patient) had osteomalacia, characterized by greatly increased osteoid volume, thickness, and surface area (OV/BV, osteoid thickness, and OS/BS), increased minerali- zation lag time, and diffuse, irregular tetracycline labeling. Se- rum bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels were also greatly increased in this patient, and he was subsequently ex- cluded from additional analyses because of the diagnosis of osteomalacia. Group 2 (1 patient) had high bone turnover os- teoporosis, characterized by moderately increased OV/BV, OS/ BS, and osteoblast content; elevated indices of bone turnover, including an increased mineralizing surface (MS/BS); increased bone formation rate (BFR/BV and BFR/TB); and extensive dou- ble tetracycline labeling at all osteoid/mineralized bone inter- faces. The serum bone alkaline phosphatase level was also 484 * CID 2003:36 (15 February) * HIV/AIDS</page><page sequence="4">Table 1.

There was a particularly strong association between osteopenia and a low current weight, BMI, trunk fat mass, whole body fat mass, and peripheral fat mass (P&lt;.01 for all). There was no correlation between osteopenia and trunk/extremities fat ratio. Other po- tential risks were analyzed, but only duration of HIV infection was additionally found to be strongly associated with osteopenia (P = .05). Finally, no specific serum or urine bone marker was found to correlate with either osteopenia or spine and hip BMD t scores. A significant correlation was noted between hip or spine BMD t scores and having ever been treated with a PI (P = .04 and P = .08, respectively). However, an even stronger cor- relation existed between BMD t scores and current weight/BMI, peripheral and trunk fat, nadir weight, and history of significant weight loss or severe wasting (P - .01 for all). Additional multivariate analyses were done to evaluate whether HAART or factors associated with HIV infection (i.e., duration of infection, nadir CD4 cell count, and HIV load) predicted BMD t scores over or in addition to known risk factors for osteopenia (i.e., steroid use, wasting, alcohol use, poor nutrition, inactivity, female sex, and aging). Although the relationship between known risk factors for osteopenia and hip and spine BMD t scores was significant (r2 = .19 and r2 = .17, respectively; Pa .001 and P .01, respectively), the ad- ditional HAART- and HIV-associated factors did not predict hip and spine BMD t scores significantly over or in addition to these known risk factors. Longitudinal Follow-Up Evolution of BMD and bone metabolism over time. Thirty- two of the original 125 patients declined participation in the longitudinal follow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between the 93 subjects who participated in the longitudinal study and the 32 subjects who declined. Three of these 93 patients were sub- sequently excluded from the longitudinal evaluation (but not the baseline evaluation) because they began receiving alen- dronate therapy. There was a small but statistically significant mean (+ SEM) percentage increase in lumbar and hip BMD for the cohort (n = 90) during the 72-week follow-up (lumbar, 2.6% + 0.6% at week 72 [all pairwise comparisons between baseline and week 24, 48, and 72 were significant; P&lt;.01]; hip, 2.4% ? 0.4% at week 72 [all pairwise comparisons were sig- 486 * CID 2003:36 (15 February) * HIV/AIDS</page><page sequence="6">10- 10 9 Spine BMD 9 Hip BMD ) 8 un 8 . 7 7 E 6 6 P0 n5 O3 5 Week Week 0 3 3 3 3 03 C 2 2 c 1 0 0 0- 0 24 48 72 0 24 48 72 n = 125 73 56 62 n = 125 73 56 62 Week Week Figure 2.

The mean percentage increases in lumbar and hip BMD during the 72-week period remained significant regardless of the duration of HIV infection or the overall duration of HAART. However, a significant positive correlation was observed between CD4 T cell increase while receiving HAART and percentage increase in lumbar (but not hip) BMD during the 72-week follow-up period (P = .02). Patients who had an undetectable HIV load at enrollment also had greater percentage gains in lumbar BMD than did patients who had a detectable virus load (3.28% vs. 0.75% gain; P = .07). There was not a significant correlation between gains in BMD and fat or weight gain during the 72-week period. Participants were further classified into 2 groups on the basis of the treatment they received for the majority of the time of follow-up (PI-based HAART regimen for 61 and non-PI-based HAART regimen for 19; 5 patients who re- ceived blinded medications, 5 who were not receiving therapy, and 3 who started receiving alendronate were excluded).

Bone metabolic markers remained elevated but generally sta- ble for all patients during the 72-week follow-up period, re- gardless of type of antiretroviral therapy, immune status, or bone mineral density, thus indicating a chronic high bone turn- over state (figure 4). DISCUSSION In the present study, we found a very high prevalence of low BMD in our HIV-infected cohort, confirming the findings of previous reports [11-14]. Currently, there is considerable un- certainty as to the contributions of HIV infection and its treat- ment toward the development of bone demineralization in this population. Two alternative hypotheses (not necessarily mu- tually exclusive) can be generated to explain the bone mineral loss observed in several cohorts of HIV-infected persons: first, bone demineralization could be related to HIV infection itself, with a nonsignificant or minimal contribution from anti- retroviral treatment; second, bone demineralization in HIV- infected patients could be initiated and/or accelerated after they start receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. Although earlier studies, including ours [12], have implicated specific antiretroviral medications or HIV infection itself as 488 * CID 2003:36 (15 February) * HIV/AIDS</page><page sequence="8">causative factors in the development of osteopenia, no study has carefully controlled for the multiple established risk factors for osteopenia that are frequently present in patients with chronic HIV infection or included longitudinal follow-up. In the present study, we found that persons with low BMD were much more likely to have &gt; 1 of these known risk factors for osteopenia. We also found that no particular aspect of HIV infection or specific antiretroviral class predicted bone demi- neralization (at baseline or longitudinally) above that predicted on the basis of these known factors. Nonetheless, given that the vast majority of the subjects were already receiving HAART (&gt;95%) and had prior PI and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor experience at the time of enrollment, it would be important to confirm these observations in additional pro- spective, longitudinal studies that would ideally contain clinical and laboratory information on subjects early in the course of HIV disease and before the initiation of HAART. Of interest, during the 72-week follow-up period, there was an increase in the mean percentage change in BMD, regard- less of type or total duration of HAART or duration of HIV infection. However, the amount of BMD gained appeared to depend on immune status and virological control of HIV infection, as indicated by the correlation between CD4 T cell count increase during therapy and HIV suppression. The ma- jority of subjects also had high indices of bone metabolism and turnover that remained generally elevated throughout the 72- week follow-up period, regardless of baseline or evolution of BMD, type of HAART received, or immune status. These results further emphasize that traditional risk factors as well as factors associated with HIV infection are likely more important con- tributors to the pathogenesis of osteopenia or osteoporosis than are HAART-related factors. The observed lack of correlation between BMD and indices of bone turnover may be partially explained by the bone biop- sy results. These findings suggest that multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of osteopenia in HIV-infected persons. Evaluation of causality is complex in epidemiology, and the evaluation in our study is not an exception. In 1965, Bradford- Hill [24] proposed a series of criteria, which epidemiologists have since used to evaluate causation. In the present study, the strength of the association of osteopenia or osteoporosis was greater for traditional risk factors and advanced HIV infection than for treatment-associated factors. There are limitations to this study. First, at baseline, a ma- jority of patients had already been taking HAART for an ex- tended period of time. It is possible that we missed any acute effect on BMD caused by the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and that our baseline measurements were made during a sub- sequent stabilization of BMD. Also, like the majority of HIV- infected persons who receive long-term antiretroviral therapy, many patients in our cohort changed various antiretroviral medications during longitudinal follow-up because of virolog- ical failure and/or intolerable side effects, thus severely limiting our ability to evaluate the impact of specific classes of antiret- roviral medications. Finally, some of the demographic data on duration of HIV infection and known risk factors for osteo- porosis were obtained from patients as historical data, thus resulting in possible recall bias. Although there is growing experimental evidence that anti- retroviral therapy affects bone metabolism [25, 26], the mag- nitude and the exact nature of its contributory effects on osteo- penia and osteoporosis will likely be gained only by conducting prospective, longitudinal studies of patients who are early in the course of HIV infection, who are naive to antiretroviral therapy, and who later go on to initiate various antiretroviral therapy regimens.
