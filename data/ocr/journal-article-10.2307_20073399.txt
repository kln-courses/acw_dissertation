A year later, in 1904, Spink &amp; Son, speciaUsts in rare coins and medals, advertised for sale a coUection of Ashanti goldweights from Africa, iUustrated with three Une drawings.1 So-caUed tribal art was not iUus trated again, nor mentioned in the pages of the Magazine, until 1917, and then in an article about children's drawings by Roger Fry.2 But this should not come as a great surprise in a Magazine devoted to the fine and decorative arts which, in the Britain of the first two decades of the last century, inevitably meant the cultures of Europe and the 'civiUsa tions' of China, Japan and, increasingly, India. The two earUest appearances of tribal art in the advertising pages of the Magazine must be viewed more generaUy as part of the interest in antiques and fancy goods supposed of its readers by advertisers, which ranged at that time from the much more visible, numerous and consistendy present advertise ments for Chinese (and to a lesser extent Japanese) decora tive art and oriental carpets, to Steinway pianos and Kodak photographic suppUes - aU expensive and aU Unked to the leisurely pursuit of culture. As Fry was to reflect in a much later article, in reference to Byzantine enamels and Coptic textiles, it was precisely the 'coUectible' quaUties of such objects, rather than their aesthetic quaUty that initially allowed artefacts produced outside a perceived Graeco Roman tradition to enter the culture: coUectors, he assert 23.

An example was Charles Read's article in 1910 on ancient Moche pottery from Peru (Fig.24). Written in the wake of the British Museum's acquisition of an important collection, he began almost apologetically: 'The readers of the Burlington magazine will probably be somewhat surprised at a subject like the present being thought worthy to come within the scope of an artistic pub lication.' But he quickly made it clear that his aim was to treat these objects not as ethnographic specimens but as art, amenable to conventional aesthetic appraisal: 'It may safely be claimed that some of their productions will stand com parison on equal terms, and will not suffer by being sub jected to the test of European canons.'4 Similarly, when Fry devoted two substantial review articles to an exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in the same year,5 he not only approached objects in the same spirit as European fine and decorative art, but pursued a thesis which sought to demon strate the Islamic influences on the development of medieval European art. Peruvian pottery and the Islamic art exhibited in Munich had the advantage of being regarded as the products of historical 'civilisations'; they were amenable to ratification in European high culture by virtue of their perception as objects from a relatively high cultural context, situated in the past. In particular, at the beginning of the twentieth century, stylistically and culturally they seemed to corre spond to European 'Primitive' art. The silver dish (Fig.25) and bronze birds illustrated in Fry's article, for example, share qualities of formal 'simplicity' and a tendency to eschew mimesis not only with the Peruvian pieces, but also with early Netherlandish and Italian painting, as well as the French and English 'Primitives', covered in the pages of THE BURLINGTON magazine from at least 1904 onwards. The practice of presenting pictorial comparisons in order to demonstrate 'affinity' is relatively common, especially in the case of non-European art.

As Christopher Green has pointed out, for Fry 'the "primitive" was not ... a threat to Western culture; it offered the stimulus for rebuilding in broader terms of the European tradition'.7 Unlike other notionally primitive art forms, tribal objects from West Africa, Oceania and North America could not be recuperated by appealing to their status as historical relics. Aside from the fine bronze work removed from Benin City as a result of the British 'punitive expedition' in February 1897, which was generally seen as archaeological8 ? that is, as representative of a past 'civilisation' since degenerated - objects from these geographical areas were viewed as the products of cultures both presentistic (or ahistorical) and in a state of 'barbarism' preceding civilisation.9 In the Social Darwinist models of evolution that were still current in the first part of the last century, they occupied a place at the wellsprings of cultural development. In this way they were simultaneously both contemporary and 'ancient'. Lacking a history that could be mapped against genealogies of artistic development based on a European evolutionist cultural tele ology, they were situated inevitably outside art-historical discourse. The reappraisal and admittance of tribal objects into European art history was only made possible by shifts in the language of criticism of contemporary European modernist art itself. If 'Primitive' and modernist art are mutually supportive in the pages of the burlington magazine in its first three decades, in the absence of a sense of history, tribal art had to accord in the first place with the present. Artistic interest in tribal art only really began to gain ground around 1905, in Paris, and then among a relatively small social group. There were some early artist-collectors in Britain, notably Jacob Epstein, and by 1912 Fry himself was aware of African sculpture and may have begun to acquire examples.10 However, the broader acceptance of tribal works as autonomous objects of art-historial study only occurred after the First World War. The immediate post war period witnessed a surge of interest in tribal art in Europe, largely as a result of the modernist credentials that had begun to accrue to it as recognition of its role deepened in the development of a Post-Impressionist aesthetic. At the forefront was Picasso's interest, demonstrated in the appropri ations of his so-called 'Negro period' around 1907-09, but by 1919 more obvious appropriations of tribal forms had begun to appear, especially in commercial art in France, as well as the proliferation of exhibitions devoted to tribal art itself.11 THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2OO4 99 7 C.

Epstein was an early and enthusiastic collector of African art, often paying high prices for important pieces, whereas Fry's acquisitions of tribal art were sporadic and relatively few. 11 For some of the key early documents dealing with tribal art in the context of modernism, seej.

Yet, as late as 1911, Laurence Binyon, in praising the opening of a new museum for art of the Far East, still felt the need to remind his readers that the 'arts of China and Japan, so long regarded as merely decorative and industrial, and relegated to the ethnographical sections of museums, have at last begun to be a serious study'.12 This shift in value was, at least in part, caused by the same sus tained disillusionment with European culture and a search for other art histories by cultural modernisers which was later to fuel the 'invention' of tribal art. More specifically, the idea of tribal art arises out of a primitivising attitude which characteristically saw recent European culture and its fine and decorative arts as creatively exhausted and crippled by sophistication; it is part of a wider search for primal mod els for cultural renewal. That the burlington magazine contributed to the spread of these kinds of ideas is without doubt. Arthur Clutton-Brock's 1911 article on 'The "Prim itive" tendency in Modern Art' tackles the subject head-on: 'A good deal of ridicule has been provoked by the efforts of some modern painters to attain to a childish na?vet? but these efforts are very like the early Christian efforts in morals .... So nowadays we have grown stale in art; we try to do too much, and waste our powers upon what is not essential. Our own past is a burden to us, not because its art was bad, but because ... we feel the same need in art as the Christians felt in morals to begin again from the beginning.'13 But it is clear that the 'primitive' to which he refers is European: 'the word primitive . . . makes us think at once of the early Italians.' And, perhaps, of Byzantium: 'Gradually a primitive, living and expressive art ousted the mechanical inexpressive art of the [Roman] empire.'14 Elsewhere, Fry himself had earlier defended charges that modern art, as represented by the works in his first Post-Impressionist exhibition in London in 1910, was 'barbaric' and 'regressive' in very similar terms. In answer to his critics, he asked rhetorically why modern artists should 'wilfully return to primitive, or... barbaric art', and answered that it was 'necessary' if art was to become once again unencumbered by formulas and dogmatism and 'regain its power to express emotional ideas'.15 Significandy, though, direct influence is also characteristically denied. For art to be challenging and valid in this scheme of things, it must not be stylistically derivative. Thus Clutton-Brock argued, 'the simplified art of the present is promising because it... is not archaistically primitive; and that is the reason why it shocks and surprises us. We can put up with imitation primitive art, because its originals have prepared us for it. . ..'l6 26. An Egyptian and an Indian figure illustrating E.B. Havell's article 'The Symbolism of Indian Sculpture and Painting', the burlington magazine 15 (1909), p.336. Among non-European peoples, the qualities of simplici ty and freedom to which critics aspired were first read into the arts of China and Japan. A 1910 editorial in the Maga zine declared that in Europe, 'we are more disillusioned, more tired with our own tradition' than ever before, but suggested that: 'To us the art of the East presents the hope of discovering a more spiritual, more expressive idea of design.'1? the burlington magazine is notable from the beginning for its intelligent and detailed coverage of non Western arts in general, notably from China, Japan and India.18 In the case of the decorative arts it is particularly rich in its coverage of textiles and carpets, mosdy from the near East.19 But direct comparisons between European and non Western art are most persistent in the areas of painting and sculpture. In 1905, for example, in an article dealing specif ically with the relationship between European and Japanese art, which prefigured Fry's and Clutton-Brock's later state ments, Charles Holmes extolled the virtues of 'sensitivity' and 'suggestiveness' in Japanese art, as against what he saw as the dogged, over-laboured 'realism' of European painting: 'Elaboration and realism . . . come as naturally to European painters as do swiftness and suggestiveness to the Oriental.'20 In his argument, the much vaunted conceptual qualities of rationalism and materialism that were more usually used to explain the advancement of western 'civilisation' were IOO FEBRUARY 2004 CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 12 L.

This was followed, between</page><page sequence="4">NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE 1930 turned against it. 'One might almost describe the difference between the art of the East and the art of the West', he argues, 'by saying that while Europeans are concerned with the aspect of things, Orientals are concerned with their vitality.'Japanese artists are praised for their essentially emo tional response to phenomena; their desire to communicate to the spectator 'the living force in man and in nature'.21 Sig nificandy, however, Holmes sets the 'primitive' qualities of 'classical' Chinese and Japanese art ? simplicity and sugges tiveness - against the 'highly cultured' level of its spectators; artists in China and Japan could rely on 'an audience ready to take up the simplest suggestion of natural objects and endow that suggestion with a fertile embroidery of reminis cence'.22 In contradistinction, Holmes suggests that a Euro pean audience is less receptive to 'expression', but more demanding of practical qualities of craftsmanship and tech nical exactitude, one that 'has to be led every step of the way and to have every detail explained to it'.2^ Crucially, though, we can presume that implicit in Holmes's critique of the sensibility of the European spectator is an invitation to the reader of the burlington magazine to regard himself as the exception to this rule. Chinese and Japanese calligraphy is once again brought to bear on an analysis of modern European drawing in a two part article by Fry from the end of the War. Yet, in retro spect, the works by Modigliani, Gaudier-Brzeska and even Matisse which illustrate the article would have lent them selves well to comparison with African sculpture.24 In a review article on pre-Columbian art, Fry not only strongly asserted the new artistic importance of Aztec and Maya sculpture, 'discovered' after being seen for centuries as scientific curiosities, but he also pointed out that 'some of our modern artists have even gone to them for inspiration'. Characteristically he attributed this transformation to 'the general aesthetic awakening which has followed on the revolt against the tyranny of the Graeco-Roman tradition'.2* In spite of all this, Fry seemingly could not resist bringing the subject back to Chinese art, and specifically to his sup port for 'the theory of influence from Eastern Asia' in pre Columbian culture, which is defended primarily on grounds of formal affinity or, as he put it, 'the curious likeness in general treatment of naturalistic forms in early Chinese and American art'.26 Similarly, in a famous article on 'Bushman Paintings', Fry once again insinuated a connection with modernism through the Far East: 'Japanese drawings . . . approach more nearly than those of any other civilized people to the immediacy and rapidity of transcription of Bushman and Palaeolithic art .... It is partly due to Japan ese influence that our own Impressionists have made an attempt to get back to that ultra-primitive directness of vision ? they deliberately sought to de-conceptualize art.

The artist of to-day has therefore to some extent a choice before him of whether he will think form like the early artists of European races or merely see it like the Bushmen.'27 In view of this, it is tempting to see as more than fortuitous the juxtaposition, for example, of TJ. Larkin's advertisement for early Chinese art and Persian pottery with one for Fry's Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition,28 or Lai-Yuan's for 'Chinese Antiquities' with one for Fry's Omega Pottery (Fig.27). Indeed, that Chinese and Japanese art was for long a crucial bridge between European and 'savage' arts is sug gested by its continued appearance in lists of the develop ment of a 'modern' sensibility. In 1917, for example, Fry argued that, 'students of the history of art . . . have gradual ly been forced by their critical faculty out of the narrow grooves of the old aesthetic orthodoxy, and ... have learned successively to accept with delight, first Gothic art, then the painting of the primitives and the early miniaturists, then the Byzantines, then early Oriental art, and finally Aztec and THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2004 101 October 1905 and March 1906, by a three-part article on the classification of oriental carpets; and between 1903 and 1930 more than a dozen articles on non European textiles were published. 20 CJ.

The arts of India, China, and Japan were "curiosities", the interest in African and other "savage" carvings was purely ethnological . . . but to the present generation is due the discovery of the aesthetic aspect of African and primitive American culture.'30 1920 saw the publication of a landmark article in THE burlington magazine by Andr? Salmon, whose creden tials as an intimate member of the most advanced Parisian artistic circles must have injected a profound air of authen ticity to his statements about 'Negro art' and its place in the modernist canon. The piece was well illustrated with African and Oceanic objects from the collections of Paul Guillaume and the British Museum (Fig.28). No apologetic preliminaries are aired here - in African sculpture, Salmon writes, we have an art that 'is admirable through its balance, its nobility of form, its sum of naked beauty'.31 In common with much of the criticism in the pages of the Magazine, Salmon emphasises 'emotional' qualities as against technical and mimetic ones, allying tribal art most closely perhaps with the supposed inherent expressiveness of European medieval sculpture: 'That which allows the black sculptor to achieve the divine in his interpretations of the human face is his plastic translation of emotion, preferably at its most intense instant.'32 Perhaps unsurprisingly, his analysis main tains close connections between modernist European prac tice and the 'example' of tribal art - indeed it was not until 1940 that an article appeared in the Magazine which consid ered African art autonomously, and even then the author, the painter Richard Carline, felt the need to first disabuse readers of the idea that this was merely an art 'associated with the French dealers'.33 That tribal art was seen from the beginning as part of the history of recent European art is underscored by the fact that Salmon authenticated it through modern art, which in turn was authenticated through tribal art. For the timid viewer, he suggested, it 'might be better before seeing the collections at the British Museum or the Trocadero ... to study the creations of the modern artists who were the first to place Negro art on a plane not inferior to that of Grecian, mediaeval, or Ancient Egyptian art'.34 He was also clear that it was 'Negro sculpture' which provided lessons for artists suffering from a profound cultural 'anguish'; Picasso, Derain, Matisse and Vlaminck were, he said, 'irresistibly drawn towards an art, primitive indeed in a sense, but already highly developed, un-shadowed by any Academy, or by any Renaissance. Such an art, if its logic were studied, was capable of reviving the dried-up sources of the classic.'35 102 FEBRUARY 2004 * CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 29 Fry, op. cit. (note 2), p.225. 30 See W.

The exhibition was advertised in the burlington magazine in the same issue as that</page><page sequence="6">NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE 1930 Salmon's stated position in relation to the tribal and the modern found confirmation in advertisements in the Magazine around this time. With the end of the War came renewed activity by French galleries who began once again to advertise. Remarkably for a periodical that was not primarily modernist in its articles, in every issue between September 1919 and July 1921 L?once Rosenberg placed a full-page advertisement for his Galerie 'L'Effort Moderne', and Paul Guillaume advertised throughout 1920, conscious ly mixing the tribal and modern (Fig. 29). Salmon had used an exhibition at the Galerie Devambez in Paris in 1919 and a f?te n?gre organised by the dealer Paul Guillaume as the starting point for his article. More or less simultaneously Fry also published a piece on African art in the Athenaeum, in response to an exhibition mainly of objects from Guil laume's collection at London's Chelsea Book Club.36 Yet, in spite of his enthusiasm for the work itself, Fry was unable to display the same unconditional delight in African culture implicit in Salmon's text. Fry remained, as Christopher Green has pointed out, curiously wedded to 'simplistic gen eralizations and the focus on racial stereotypes dominant in British attitudes to Africa at the time'.37 This meant that he was able to claim that some of the African works 'are great sculpture - greater, I think, than anything we produced even in the Middle Ages',38 while questioning the very pos sibility of development or even a real sense of cultural iden tity: 'It is curious that a people who produced such great artists did not produce also a culture in our sense of the word.'39 These artists had 'the most exquisite sensibility and the finest taste', he argued, but what was missing was the self-critical faculty that 'distinguishes civilized peoples'. Then, in a strange discursive turn he both reveals his prefer ence for early Chinese culture and seemingly blames Africa rather than Europe for the hitherto negative reception of its material culture: 'if we imagined such an apparatus of criti cal appreciation as the Chinese have possessed from the earli est times [my italics] applied to Negro art, we should have no difficulty in recognising its singular beauty. We should never have been tempted to regard it as savage or unrefined.'40 Fry's ambivalence found voice only tangentially into the pages of the burlington magazine, in W.G. Constable's rather dismissive review from 1921 of another exhibition of African art at the Goupil Gallery, in which he dwells on the fragility of 'pure' African production. While dismissing attempts to construct histories of African art, he also claims that 'earlier Negro Art has a fantastic dignity of which even museums and exhibitions cannot rob it; but later manifesta tions have not been able to survive European influence'.41 Tribal art was part of a number of 'non-naturalistic' cultur al forms that were regarded as in some way primitive in the early twentieth century, from folk art to pre-Columbian and early Asian art.42 It is clear from coverage given in the Mag azine that these various artefacts and, to some extent, the Selected Works by ANDRE DERAIN, HENRI-MATISSE, PICASSO, MODIGLIANI, MARIE . lAURENCIN, RENOIR, GAUGUIN, BONNARD, VLAMINGK, etc bine Specimens of Negro Sculpture.

As Green points out, 'the notion of civilization' was always at the centre of Fry's 'set of values'.43 There is never a serious challenge to 'civilised' values, nor to the supremacy of the western canon (although it is one that is reconstructed to marginalise the 'Graeco-Roman' tradi tion). Art history, in this model, is predicated in Aristotelian terms as a cycle of cultural renewals, not so much a history of regressions but rather of returns to a point at which forward movement is once again possible. From the beginning, the 'antiquarian' interests of THE BURLINGTON magazine led to articles on non-European subjects, and its generally 'pre-Raphaelite' position meant that the art of the European Primitives was also generously covered. I have argued that Chinese and Japanese art play an important mediatory role between the 'civilised' and the 'primitive' in the pages of the Magazine. However, another occasional presence is also of crucial importance, namely the child. Like Far Eastern art, children's drawings were consis tendy used as familiar markers in treatments of 'inartistic' subjects. Thus, in 'Bushman Paintings', even as he struggles to account for the essential difference of this work to other primitive models, Fry declares: 'The primitive drawing of our own race is singularly like that of children .... The child does, of course, know that the figure thus drawn is not like a man, but it is a kind of hieroglyphic script for a man, and THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2004 103 in which Salmon's article appeared. In addition to 'Negro Sculpture', it also lists 'Peruvian Pottery', although there is no mention of this confluence in Fry's review. 37 Green, op. dt. (note 7), p. 136. 38 Fry 1920, op. dt.

The [primitive] artist does not seek to transfer a visual sensation to paper, but to express a mental image which is coloured by his conceptual habits.'44 Elsewhere, he says that 'children's drawings are genuine examples of primitive art' (Fig. 30) and, like chil dren, 'the primitive artist is intensely moved by events and objects, and ... his art is the direct expression of his wonder and delight in them'.45 This is not the case, Fry claims, for contemporary European adults whose self-consciousness prevents them from retaining the 'intimacy and sharpness of notation, the impr?vu quality of primitive art'.46 Such claims are made possible by employing a sociologi cal extrapolation of the German scientist Ernst Haeckel's 'biogenetic law' which states that the 'history of the embryo is an expression of the history of its lineage; or in other words: Ontogeny is a recapitulation of phylogeny'.47 By extension, it could be suggested that what the child is to the adult, 'primitive' society is to 'civilised' society. Also implicit in this is the Darwinian idea that evolution always proceeds from the relatively simple and undifferentiated towards complexity and specialisation. In this way the child emerges as the 'primitive' par excellence around which other notions of the 'savage' and 'primitive' culture revolve, creating a taxonomy of primitivity that connects disparate artefacts and helps render them amenable to formalist critique. This is admirably demonstrated in G. Baldwin Brown's 1922 article in the Magazine on the origin of the arts, in which he conflates history and evolutionism: 'The earliest phenomena of art are partly to be studied among primitive peoples of the modern world, who, like the Aus tralian aborigines, the almost extinct Bushmen of Africa, or the Eskimo, are still in the hunter stage.' Such expression, he says, demonstrates essentials, for 'painting and sculpture aim not at copying nature, but at producing an aesthetic impres sion'.48 Thus, technical virtuosity ? which is associated with complexity and specialisation - is regarded at best as anteri or to that which is proper to art, and untutored expression is privileged. As Fry put it: 'We have to recognise that our admiration of an artist's skill is not aesthetic .... We have to get rid of the idea that our favourable aesthetic judgement of a work of art is a kind of prize conferred on the artist for meritorious effort.'49 A sense of a longing for the primitive recurs consistendy in the pages of the burlington magazine in its first three 3o. The boxing match, a watercolour by Winifred Edwards, aged twelve, illustrating Roger Fry's review 'Children's Drawings', the burlington magazine 44 (1924), p. 3 7. decades. For example, an editorial of 1922 reminds readers that: 'Our complex culture is demanding for its sustenance a more and more intimate experience of the simplest and remotest manifestations of man's emotional and intellectual life.'50 Yet, even before Fry's death in 1934, the Magazine seems to have pulled back from its modernist position. Surprisingly, this remained true of the years of Herbert Read's editorship (1933-39). In spite of his own impeccable modernist credentials and writing on contemporary art and its relationship to non-European models in other publica tions,51 Read's period at the Magazine coincides with a dearth of this kind of material. Instead, to find the legacy of the Magazine's influential earUer contribution, we have to look forward to a remarkable exhibition staged at the then fledgling Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, in which Read was closely involved, and which brought together tribal, prehistoric and contemporary western art in order to demonstrate, as Read wrote, 'the universality of art, and, more particularly, the eternal recurrence of certain phenomena in art which, on their appearance, are labelled "modern"'. In many ways reminiscent of Fry, the exhibi tion was entided 40,000 Years of Modem Art.52 104 FEBRUARY 2004 CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 44 Fry 1910, op. dt. (note 27), p.334. 45 Fry, op. dt. (note 29), p.226. 46 Ibid. The argument is further developed in a review of an exhibition of chil dren's drawings at the Independent Gallery; R. Fry: 'Children's Drawings', the burlington magazine 44 (1924), pp.3 5-41. The exhibition consisted of work made under the guidance of the art teacher Marion Richardson by her pupils at Dudley High School, Birmingham (a few years earlier, pupils had contributed to a show of drawings at Fry's Omega Workshops, February-March 1917). Fry viewed Richardson's methods as revolutionary because they preserved, he believed, the 'natural' state of vision and its expressive translation. Fry's interest in Richardson's methods is discussed in 'Expanding the Canon', in Green, op. dt. (note 7), pp. 128-29. 47 E.

Fry himself introduces an interesting dimension of class division into the discussion, even as he suggests the relative universality of the child's vision. In the West Mid lands, which he describes as an 'artistically arid and waterless desert of modern life', he says, '[Marion Richardson] has shown that quite average children of lower middle class parents . . . have in them the same kind of feeling about the life and nature of their surroundings as the primitive artists of, say, fifteenth-century Italy'; Fry, op. dt.
