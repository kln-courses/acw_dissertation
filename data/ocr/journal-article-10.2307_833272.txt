<plain_text><page sequence="1">ICMC88: CROSSROADS AT COLOGNE OHN RAHN HE 1988 INTERNATIONAL Computer Music Conference was held Sep- tember 19-25th at Cologne in the Federal Republic of Germany, under the direction of Clarence Barlow of GIMIK (music) and Cristoph Lischka of the Gesellschaft ftir Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (science). The opening event Monday night set the tone. Those of us who found our way to the tower of the West German Radio entered through a uterus-like pas- sage to a womb-like circular chamber at ground floor, where we were asked to exchange money for tickets. After liquid refreshment, we were allowed to transfer (swimming upstream) in elevator-sized blocks to the upper saucer overlooking the city. As we walked from the elevator around the cir- cumference of the saucer to the banquet room, it occurred to some of us that the event was very like a piece by Clarence Barlow.</page><page sequence="2">1988 ICMC A sumptuous banquet and a message from the mayor of Cologne rejoic- ing in that city's claim to a history of experimental electronic music awaited us. Paul Lansky's Just_ More_dle Chatter was played though an inade- quate sound system over the conversation of the packed crowd, many of whom were standing, tableless, shoulder to shoulder. The piece is a sequel to Paul Lansky's Idle Chatter, a piece of computer-Rap music that has become (as Paul's pieces tend to do) a sort of musical and sonic benchmark. Clarence Barlow introduced an improvisation by George Lewis by kindly advising the crowd that it would be over when the tower had rotated 360 degrees, returning to its original orientation. (It is stationary.) Mr. Lewis scolded the audience severely for their idle chatter during Paul Lansky's piece, and it sat cowed through his trombone-cum-microcomputer improv, which was vigorous, musical, and effuse. Technical difficulties delayed the third scheduled piece, Amnon Wolman's cafe-conversation composition Conversations, until most of the audience had gone home or were in the process of leaving. The concert Tuesday night was held in the excellent auditorium of the Music Academy. The audience was allowed to sit in seats, a privilege we did not yet fully appreciate. The concert opened with a good performance of Charles Dodge's Viola Elegy, which he wrote "after learning of Morton Feldman's tragic and untimely death.... The writing of this piece helped me to accept his absence. " The Viola Elegy is based on computer music gen- erated from fractals. The viola part selectively doubles the tape, except for a solo cadenza at the end. It reminded me, appropriately, of Georgia O'Keefe's cloud paintings: great, massive but light, sculpted but rather two-dimensional throngs crowded together with little blue between them-almost an effect of one of those painters called "primitive." Next came Jean-Claude Risset's Voilements for saxophone and tape, in an impressive performance by Michael Riessler. The lively interaction between soloist and tape was achieved partly in composition by transcribing cap- tured MIDI data into Music V code for more complex resynthesis, in what must be one of the earliest uses of this interesting technique. The final sec- tion of Voilements (which was composed in 1987) became more like Risset's previous piece Sud in sound, with great Naturklange in the background. Horacio Vaggione's piece Tar, for bass clarinet and tape, received a virtuoso performance, also by Michael Riessler. We each have our favorite pieces, often decided for personal reasons, but Tar is my candidate (among many other good compositions) for the most exciting piece in ICMC88. It was created using the Cmusic synthesis program at the Technical University in West Berlin (though Vaggione teaches at the University of Paris-8 [Vin- cennes]). Sweeping transformations of clarinet sounds filled the hall with winds of sound, flurries of notes like autumn leaves, stormy night skies, a welkin in a nutshell. 265</page><page sequence="3">Perspectives of New Music After an intermission, we heard Barry Truax's Nike for computer-gener- ated tape and projected slides whose images were also computer generated, by composer Theo Goldberg, from photos of the Greek statue of the female figure of Winged Victory (Nike). The sounds were the result of a granular synthesis technique which avoided cliches of timbre. The piece managed to be humorous, mildly sexy, and serious. It is one of the more successful pieces of audio-visual art I have experienced. Finally, we heard Daniel Scheidt's robust Obeying the Laws of Physics, for percussion and com- puters responding to the percussionist in real time. The soloist, Trevor Tureski, who performed with verve, taught percussion for the Royal Moroccan Air Force Military Band in 1983. The concert Wednesday night was a horse of a different color. Clarence Barlow had arranged for busses to take us from the Old University, where the lectures were mostly held, north to a dock near the Dom. A Rhine-boat was laid on, on which we guzzled beer and snacks while travelling south on the river, then back north to the original dock. The crowd was then directed to a funicular station, whence to the politely muted horror of some of us, we crossed high above the Rhine, knee to knee in swaying but, as it proved, safe little cars. Another bus collected us and dropped us off at what seemed to be an abandoned boat works. It was an abandoned boat works. A marvellously urban wreck of a large shed contained more available beer. (So far this was rather fun, even if German beer gave one gas.) The floor of the shed was covered with several inches of sawdust. This pre- sented a hazard to high heels, of which there were fortunately few, and del- icate electronic equipment. The shed had large gaps in its walls which admitted daylight until it was dark outside. Cecilie Ore cancelled her piece for audio and video TV moniters, Kald Verden. After an hour or more of standing around (no seats), the first piece began: Johannes Goebel's Vom Ubersetzen iber den FluP. This is a tape piece composed at CCRMA (Stanford) using software-generated fractal noise heavily post-processed with resonators and envelopes. If there has been a CCRMA style, this is not in it. Broad washes of shaped noises issued loudly from four giant loudspeakers placed around the sawdust-covered half of the shed that was our listening area. I rather enjoyed this piece, but was impelled to experience it while walk- ing around, which brings me to the art show. The nether half of the shed had been left in its pristine state. I first noticed, in the far rear of the shed, a compelling exhibit consisting of what once had been an old red shirt, torn off someone's back and rent by a number of small, three-cornered tears, as if by a point or curved beak. It lay in stiff folds under a layer of grease and what looked like blood, surrounded by feathers, many of which adhered to the shirt. The scene reeked of violence. It was then that I noticed, under the Uber den Flufl, the low cooing or moaning sounds coming from the 266</page><page sequence="4">1988 ICMC many birds in the rafters. It was not possible to see them clearly enough to identify their species, but they seemed larger than doves or pigeons. Among the many other art works exhibited there I will mention only the huge heap of greasy grey chain made of links about three inches long and one inch thick, as it were the spilled guts of some anthropomorphic machine; the delicate but pathetic arrangement of wire and wood shards, like a squashed Calder; and the twelve-foot high Arp sculpture inspired by an eighty-year-old drill press for making six-foot iron cheerios. After the Goebel, we heard Eric Huffmann's video piece Crab Canon III, which is a meditation that presents the viewer with "sparse iconic visions that invite mythical fantasy." James Harley's Per Foramen Acus Transire for flute and tape was spiritual in intent. It was realized on the UPIC system at CEMAMu (Xenakis's studio in Paris). Finally, Saisiki X + Y by Takehito Shimazu showed what could be done with MIDI-based "equipment ... so compact, that one man can carry it all." It presented thick, dense, loud walls of sound that absolutely did not recall MIDI cliches, and that were composed together into an interesting and original piece. It was around 11:00 P.M., and we had been standing since around 6:00. The bus-and-boat-and-funicular trip to Parametron had disoriented us. There was no bus; no telephone by which to call taxis. Nothing in the neighborhood was open. Clarence Barlow kindly provided directions when asked, on how to walk back to the bridge across the Rhine, which we might have seen from the funicular (now shut), and up a spiral ramp several sto- ries from ground level to the bridge level. Crowds of us, clumping with an average granularity of around twelve people, thronged hither and thither through the German night in that industrial neighborhood, calling out to one another, pursuing false trails, clashing like armies of ants, rebounding, merging, and converging (at least some of us) on the spiral ramp up to the bridge. Crossing amid loud traffic, we emerged down a ramp on the other side of the Rhine to more darkness and trolley tracks that looked as though they had long since despaired of ever again feeling the rumble of mated wheels. An Italian restaurant, surprised by joy, accommodated our weary and very hungry bodies, and called taxis for the post-prandial trip back to our hotels. Thursday offered a lunch concert featuring Duelfor Two Percussionists, by Peter Desain and Henkjan Honing. This is a wire framework of a piece, very conceptual and ascetic, for two claves players acoustically separated from each other and directed by computer via earphones through five phases of coincident and noncoincident patterns. At 5:30 on Thursday there was a concert at an old building on the riverbank which has been used for art events, but remains in a state of satisfactorily artistic urban dilapida- tion. From a very small, low-ceilinged, dark room in the middle of this 267</page><page sequence="5">Perspectives of New Music building were emitted sounds whose loudness drove out all but a handful of hardened listeners. All those who remained that I was able to see, had their fingers in their ears. Most of the audience chatted in shouts in the outer rooms and outside of the building during the concert. This is a pity since the music was not uninteresting. I stayed only for the first piece, SLP by Selektion, a sort of German Scratch group scratching their previous recording NICHTS NIEMAND NIRGENDS NIE! at enormous volume together. Subsequent pieces were Heatnoise by Bruno Degazio, This Is Not Iggjy Pop and Conversation with John Cage by John Free, and Onge-T by Zbig- niew Karkowski &amp; friends. The concert Thursday night included Andre Werner's Canti Muti; Karl F. Gerber's Doomsday; Nicholas Collins's A Letter from My Uncle; and John McGuire's Vanishing Points. My spirit was willing, but my flesh demanded a long, restful dinner after the night before, so unfortunately I cannot report on that concert. A lunch concert on Friday featured Rodney Waschka II's piece Quotes, with Beth Griffith, soprano, and the composer at the piano. The titles of the songs are: 1. "I went to a concert the other day" (Jerry Hunt) 2. "So I told them: 'If it's less than 200 Guilders, I just really couldn't be bothered' " (Paul Berg) 3. "Why does the Liefde have to be so hard?" (Toze Ferreira) 4. "Frankly, I don't know where the formula comes from" (Clarence Barlow) 5. "Give it to them, they want it" (Martin Bar- tlett). The Friday night concert was again at the Music Academy. Clavirissima, by Rainer Boesch, saw the composer at the piano in a virtuosic perform- ance. It was a nice, old-fashioned piano piece, and I enjoyed it. Golemics, by Richard Teitelbaum, was a complex network of microcomputers, MIDI devices, a piano (Teitelbaum), trombone (Garrett List), and reeds (Michael Riessler). These sounds, plus sampled sounds from the natural world and also from texts such as the Kabbala, combined with live signal processing, FM, and speech synthesis in an interactive brew in which the computer software reacted to the actions of the human performers. This was clearest at the beginning, when Richard Teitelbaum played a few piano notes. One could hear the system reacting to each phrase, bouncing it around as though the system were a sonic trampoline. Once clued in this way, we could follow the interactions in the thicker textures to come in this long, improvisatory piece. Golemics reminded me of the group improvisations that have been taking place around the composers Benjamin Boretz and James K. Randall. To end the first half of the concert we heard a pleasant, unprogrammed tape piece by Cecilie Ore, who had had to cancel her video piece in the boat-works shed. It was good that such difficulties did not pre- vent her representation at the conference. During the intermission, we experienced FISCH 111,3,3 / IV,1,1: "The Futileness of North America / The Thinking, " by Frank H. Rothkamm. The 268</page><page sequence="6">1988 ICMC composer sat on a high chair in the lobby, imitating Rodin's statue, while nothing much went on. A nearby computer screen showed that some pro- gram had been started. It was a mildly pleasant spoof. Back in the auditorium, we heard Transparency for harp (Masumi Nagasawa) and tape, by Takayuki Rai, followed by Richard Karpen's Exchange for flute and com- puter-generated tape. Exchange was sensitive in its treatment of the flute/ tape timbres. Its rushing, fast flute lines remind one of Berio in a certain period. Camilla Hoitenga gave it the virtuoso flute performance it demands. The concert ended, some four hours after it began, with Der Rotkdppchen-Begleiter for soprano and interactive computer, by Masahiro Miwa. The system reacted to the singer's voice as she told and sang the story of Little Red Riding Hood. It is a nice conceit and a well-crafted piece. The Saturday lunch concert was devoted to audio-video art. Little Ani- mals (music by Rick Bidlack, video by Alan Finke) was entirely computer generated using a "knowledge base," fractals, and so on. Noel Zahler's Gothic Tempest was based on an excerpt from Hermann Broch's The Death of Virgil: "Oh earthly life, the diaphanous world and the world of darkness...." It had artistic content, which was welcome. From Riccardo Sinigaglia we heard and saw Urbana, and Gates (video by Mario Canali). These were both slick, well-made pieces. Somebody commented that they verged toward a business-presentation video, but that was not entirely fair, as each contained the seeds of its own development, and was not selling anything. The concert ended with Out (Excerpt) by Alain Thibault (video by Miguel Reymond). At its last presentation in Toronto it used thirty video moniters and much other equipment; at Cologne it had only one moniter. The work is in the tradition of audio-video art that has developed in French Canada. At this point I left to catch a plane, so can only reproduce here the pro- grams of the remaining concerts. On Saturday night: Daniel Brandt, Repetez s.v.p. and Four Echoic Episodes; W. Andrew Schloss, Meconium; Curtis Roads, Message; and Ron Kuivila, Loose Canons. At midnight Saturday, in the Philharmonie: Michel Waisvisz, Archaic Symphony; Cort Lippe, Duo Piano Music; Alejandro Viniao, Toccata del Mago; Drew Lesso, Great River and Bentov's Universe; and Kaija Saariaho, lo. Finally, there was an hour- long event in the niche in time created by the transition from Summer to Winter Time, from 2:00 A.M. Sunday to 2:00 A.M. Sunday. Eleven Euro- pean studios were scheduled to interact electronically via MIDI in a grand group improvisation in the lobby of the Music Academy. It cannot be said that this was an entirely successful conference. Many of the paper and demonstration sessions suffered from lack of equipment and technical support, resulting in a chaotic schedule as people tried to catch 269</page><page sequence="7">Perspectives of New Music up. Let this be a lesson to the organisers of future ICMCs: a solid institu- tional and organisational base is necessary for such a complex task. The papers themselves are available in a Proceedings that was printed and distributed to attendees at the conference, and can be purchased from the Computer Music Association (P.O. Box 1634, San Francisco, CA 94101). They reflect an orientation that is predominantly not compositional or artistic, nor even toward computer science, but rather toward "music engineering. " Manufacturers such as Yamaha are well served by these research papers. Those in attendance at ICMC88 reflected a schizophrenia between the composers and the engineers. Perhaps this is in part healthy, as composers keep in touch with the engineering basis of their equipment, and engineers are exposed to some music which many of them would never listen to in other circumstances. The papers which I found most interesting were those that might be fairly described as scientific rather than engineering papers. For example, the ESQUISSE Lisp compositional environment from IRCAM, described at ICMC88 by Magnus Lindberg, Yves Potard, and Kaija Saariaho; Barry Vercoe's speculations on cognitive modelling in his paper on "Connection Machine Tracking of Polyphonic Audio"; and the "Key-Music" expert system for musical composition described by A. Camurri of the University of Genoa, which employs semantic frame-based multiple inheritance net- works, Petri nets, and actor nets to construct a model so general that it serves equally for musical composition and the undersea movements of crabs, or for robotics. It might be a good idea for future ICMCs to try to encourage papers that really are in computer science, or music theory, aes- thetics, and composition-unless, of course, Yamaha and similar companies begin paying ICMC to continue what has really been a research-trade fair for musical engineering. Even if these companies do start pulling their weight, ICMC would serve the musical world better by widening its embrace and renewing its historical roots in the artistic and scientific arenas. There are always complaints about the selection of musical compositions to be played, and certainly some excellent pieces were not selected for this conference. Italy, for example, which is now a hotbed of computer music, was represented by relatively few compositions. On the whole, however, the musical programs were artistically interesting and successful, and eclec- tic to a fault. (The aggression with which Clarence Barlow broke some of the conventional artistic confines of ICMC was striking.) Computer music used to be a technical curiosity, forgiven its glaring artistic deficiencies for the sake of its innovations. The music played at ICMC88 needs no apolo- gies: it is some of the best music being composed for any medium any- where. Important European composers such as Xenakis, Nono, Boulez, Stockhausen, and Berio, who compose computer music and integrate it into grand operas, were conspicuous by their absence, as were important 270</page><page sequence="8">1988 ICMC 271 American composers active in computer music, such as Morton Subotnik and John Chowning. It would be worth a special effort to ensure that in the future, ICMC will bring together for communion both some of the good, younger composers and some of the major figures in the world of composition.</page></plain_text>
