<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stated Meeting Report Some Forms of Art Patronage (Slide Lecture) Carl Djerassi The word "some" is the operative term of my title. Just because I shall emphasize certain forms of art patronage, however, does not mean that I denigrate others, notably those extended by government and corporate sources. But given current controversies about the dispersal of what is crudely called the "taxpayer's dollar"-with all the connota- tions of populist censorship and parsimony inherent in those words-I shall limit myself to the most non-bureaucratic version: private patronage. All art appreciation, be it of "The Arts" or of individual artists, is by definition subjective. The role of personal taste is particularly pro- nounced in three common forms of private patronage of the arts: acquiring, collecting, and commissioning. It is not surprising, therefore, that the most avant-gardist and daring artists are likely to be least patronized, primarily because their works issue from an exploration of unfamiliar aesthetic or intellec- tual territory. The last part of my presenta- tion will deal with a form of artist's patronage that largely separates an evaluation of the product of the artist from that of his productiv- ity, thus reducing the effects of subjectivity and unfamiliarity. But before doing so, I wish to address two conventional, but important, forms of private patronage: collecting and commissioning works of art. While all collectors acquire art, not all ac- quirers of art are collectors. Usually, collect- ing requires components of knowledge and aesthetic judgment that are often absent in the simple acquisition of a work. Collectors are patrons of artists if the latter are still living. But when the artist of the collected work is dead, and especially when the artist has been fetishized, we are entering the terri- tory of the Arts with all the connotations of 51</page><page sequence="2">canonization that the capital letter A implies. My experience with collecting the works of Paul Klee is such an example, and I cite it because promising my Klee collection to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has made me into a kind of patron of the Arts. Concern with patronage of the artists only came later. My own definition of art collecting is some- what narrow. I am not referring to the pur- chase of occasional pieces of art, nor to col- lecting based primarily on investment motives. Rather, I focus on the serious collec- tor, the person who concentrates on a specific artist, a specific art movement, or applies some other self-imposed criterion; who ren- ders an intellectual judgment and to that extent places a personal signature on the collection. Assembling five Picassos at random is very different from deliberately selecting five Picassos to make a specific aesthetic, ped- agogic, historic, or personal point about the artist. Collecting the works of dead artists be- comes a form of patronage only when it serves the public benefit. In many respects, the serious collector of a dead artist's work also becomes that artist's interpreter. If one takes this role seriously, then such collecting can become an exciting creative process: one presents a special view of the artist by select- ing specific aspects of that artist's output. Displaying many works of one artist in one place is, in my opinion, far preferable to distributing the works over many sites. When such a collection is made available to the public, the social benefit is clear. I have a ong-held personal belief about private art collections-especially those specializing in one artist. If a significant portion of an artist's output is concentrated in one collection, then it ought to be available to the public. A mu- seum is the obvious place, but all too often this means the basement of the museum rather than exhibition space. Because of Klee's mod- est space requirements-he is the perfect ex- ample of a master of the "petit format"-one need not unduly impose on a museum's lim- ited gallery space by requesting that a signif- icant portion of the collection always be on display. In fact, the size of his works requires 52</page><page sequence="3">intimate space, and intimate space immedi- ately leads to intimacy of another nature: close inspection of the work, attention to detail, and the ultimate punctuation mark, the gasp of delight. Many cities, both in this country and abroad, of San Francisco's size are frequently villages-in a cultural sense. The cosmopoli- tan character of San Francisco, its geograph- ical location, and its history have helped to avoid the cultural village status. It is a city on an intimate scale, which deserves an intimate painter like Paul Klee, and this is where my collection will remain. Since one of the pleasures of collecting art is that it need not be justfied to anybody else, I shall comment only briefly on how I became enamored of Klee, whose works I have now collected for the past quarter of a century. In my college days, I had seen reproduc- tions-on postcards, calendars (modern soci- ety's ultimate accolade), posters, catalogs, art books-of Paul Klee's most famous works, such as "Twittering Machine" or "Ad Parnas- sum." Subsequently, I saw many of his oils, drawings, and watercolors in museums in Europe as well as in this country. Only later did I learn something about the man through his notebooks, diaries, poetry, and music. That subsequent knowledge only confirmed my intuitive response gained from his art: here was an extraordinary combination of intellect, aesthetic sensitivity, and desire for experimentation. Over the course of four decades, Klee created nearly nine thousand works of art in almost every medium-from graphics to oils, from surfaces such as burlap, plaster of Paris, and glass to every type of paper and canvas, and even puppets and sculpture. In terms of subject matter and technique, he seems to have anticipated al- most every art movement, even those of to- day-some fifty years after his death. In the mid 1960s, I went to my first Klee show in a commerical gallery, where all of the works were for sale. Until then, actually own- ing a Klee had not occurred to me. But included in that show in London were two magnificent watercolors from his Bauhaus years in the twenties-rather large ones for an artist who usually worked on such a small 53</page><page sequence="4">scale-to which I kept returning over and over again. "Should I? Could I?" I asked myself. Finally, I approached one of the gal- lery employees and asked about the price. "The 1925 'Horse and Man'?" he asked, look- ing me up and down. "Sixteen," he finally said. "Sixteen what?" I wanted to ask, but didn't. I knew it could not be 1,600, and was unlikely to be 160,000, so it had to be 16,000. But sixteen thousand what? Dollars, pounds, or even guineas? "And the other one, the 1927 'Heldenmutter'?" I asked hesitantly. "Eighteen." "Hm," I replied and went back to look at the pictures. A few minutes later, the man appeared by my side. "Which one do you prefer?" he asked in a slightly warmer tone. "I can't make up my mind," I said, "both of them are superb." "Buy them both," he said matter-of-factly, "and maybe we can arrange a better price." Bargaining, whether in a marketplace in Mexico or a bazaar in Cairo, always makes me uncomfortable, but this time I haggled by default. Every retreat of mine, every inspec- tion and reinspection of first one, and then the other Klee, caused the price to drop. They were not big reductions, but given the overall sums-far above anything I had ever spent before on art-they were not insignificant. Finally, I said, "I'll have to think about it." A couple of days later, I was the owner of not one but two Klees. By now I own many more of his works in various media, including most of his early graphics, but these two watercol- ors are still among the creme de la creme. A few years later, I visited Felix Klee, the painter's son, in his flat in Bern and saw his extraordinary collection, which included pup- pets his father had made for him-a genre of Klee that until then was unknown to me. He also showed me his mother's guest book. The first entry was Wassily Kandinsky, who did not just inscribe the book, but drew a colored picture on that page. Not to be outdone, many of the other guests-Lyonel Feininger, George Grosz, and others I do not remem- ber-did likewise. It is one of the most inti- mate and exquisite documents of European art of the 1920s and 30s. As I will mention 54</page><page sequence="5">later, this guest book led to a contemporary variant of my own. * * * I now turn from patronage of the Arts to the type of patronage that I believe is needed most urgently at the end of the twentieth century: direct support of artists. I shall start with the oldest and noblest forms of private patronage: the commissioning of works of art. I shall not talk about the Medicis, although they are the type of patrons I admire most, because they supported a multiplicity of art- ists as well as disciplines: painters, sculptors, architects, humanists. Nor will I dwell on the pros and cons of a life-long relation between artist and patron, whose aesthetic preferences may unconsciously or deliberately influence the artist. I think of Giorgio Vasari's comment in 1550: "Cosimo de'Medici was the perfect patron. He kept Donatello continually at work, and Donatello understood Cosimo so well that he always did exactly as Cosimo desired." Nevertheless, most artists would be more than willing to take that risk in return for long-term, enlightened patronage. But since my talk is restricted to the con- temporary art scene, I shall select another Italian living in Santomato di Pistoia, only a few miles from Cosimo's Florence, to demon- strate the impact that just one private art patron can exert. Some years ago, Giuliano Gori-a textile manufacturer in Prato, next door to Florence-acquired the estate and olive groves of the seventeenth-century Car- dinal Fabrone in the Tuscan hills above San- tomato. Named Fattoria di Celle, this has be- come in less than a dozen years one of the most ambitious private collections of contem- porary art in Europe. Gori's patronage en- compasses collecting as well as commission- ing, but it is the latter activity, in which he indulges on a grand scale, that I wish to illustrate tonight. With a handful of excep- tions, all of the outdoor installations, spread over many acres of deciduous forest, olive groves, and vineyards, have been commis- sioned. There is no common denominator of medium, size, national origin, or artistic school. The artist is invited to create a site- specific work of art with much of the labor 55</page><page sequence="6">provided by workers from the premises or the neighborhood. Describing these works is largely pointless, because words cannot do justice to the visual impact that inherently "non-environmental" materials (such as con- crete or Corten steel) can have in such a natural setting when utilized sensitively by a creative artist. The selection of color images I am about to show is not so much a reflection of my personal preferences, as a cursory dem- onstration of the range of artists, materials, and natural settings that Gori's patronage and connoisseur's eye have sponsored and assem- bled within very few years. I know of no public museum that has gathered so much commissioned contemporary sculpture as the private Fattoria di Celle. The latter does not suffer from the financial restrictions of most museums; furthermore, aesthetic decisions are made by one person and not by commit- tees, which often sacrifice the very best on the altar of consensus. Consider the range encompassed by the following artists, my selection of the twenty- nine sculptors whose works grace an area of approximately seventy acres within the imme- diate vicinity of the main Villa Celle and the adjacent Fattoria building (itself a monument to indoor commissioned art): Dani Karavan's (Israeli) white concrete line, starting in an open field, seemingly passing through two plane trees and then penetrating a thick, planted bamboo grove (hardly expected in Tuscany) down to a small lake, where a row boat-part of the Karavan installation-is moored; Robert Morris's (American) green and white marble labyrinth, set at an incline, thus introducing a startlingly effective spatial component to the usual puzzle of a labyrinth; the multi-component marble "Death of Ephi- altes" by Anne and Patrick Poirier (French) at the foot of a small waterfall centered around a huge eye penetrated by an arrow; Magdalena Abakanowicz's (Polish) deeply moving assembly (entitled "Catharsis") of thirty-three bronze hollow torsos in a fenced field facing a stone wall; Alan Sonfist's (Amer- ican) "Circles of Time," a huge circle of local rocks surrounding a circle of laurel, followed by a circle of bronze castings of endangered and extinct trees, and finally ending in a small 56</page><page sequence="7">planting of olive trees and wheat. Close by is Inoue Bukichi's (Japanese) "My Sky Hole"-a stone path descending into the earth through a glass door into a concrete tunnel, illumi- nated by small sky lights and eventually rising into a glass cube through which the visitor steps out into the open-a work that took over four years to complete. Just as I started my selection with work made out of concrete (Karavan's straight white line), I end with another installation from such industrial ma- terial, Mauro Staccioli's (Italian) enormous triangular slab, pushing through the bush toward the passerby. Staccioli will return once more in my talk in another context. Not too far away, within easy sight, is a charming nineteenth-century tea-house. The meadow below it forms a natural amphitheater, which is in the process of being converted into an outdoor performance space and stage by the American sculptor Beverly Pepper, who re- sides in Italy. Starting in 1991, multi-disciplinary perfor- mances will be staged in this space which is testimony to Gori's wider-ranging patronage. Indications of such interest can be discerned in the extraordinary indoor space, which Gori has created during the last decade; first in the main villa, where he resides, and more re- cently in the adjacent Fattoria, which consists simply of numerous white-washed rooms and open spaces, illuminated by super-modern Italian mercury lights. Each room, corridor, or entrance way has been offered to one of thirty-four artists (the majority-such as Mimmo Paladino, Michelangelo Pistoletto, and Aldo Spoldi-Italian) who have created an array of installations, ranging from mini- mal and whimsical pieces to extraordinarily complex and moving ones. Luciano Ori's vi- sual concert "Pictures of an Exhibition: Con- cert for a Year" constitutes a visual artist's counterpoint to Mussorgsky's musical "Pic- tures at an Exhibition." The center of the room contains a grand piano and a life-size cut out of a musician-a silk screen on glass so realistic as to fool most spectators. The accom- panying pictography covering the walls con- tains fifteen works of art on music sheets created by a "painter," who changed into a "visual poet" and finally into a "technological 57</page><page sequence="8">painter." This concert cannot be performed, yet it is being performed in front of the viewer. The complete transformation toward per- formance art is demonstrated by one of Gori's favorites, Aldo Spoldi-an Italian, who speaks not a word of English, but is so captivated by American language and culture, that he now operates under the aegis of "Banca di Okla- homa, Aldo Spoldi, Presidente." Starting with cut-outs and frescoes, Spoldi has now pro- gressed to full performances. The color slides I show of his installation "Pictorial Comedy" in Gori's Fattoria building or his "Gen. Geo. Washington Reviewing the Western Army at Fort Cumberland" are representative of his whimsical humor. His interest in perfor- mance art culminated in "Capitan Fracassa," which he termed an "opera lirica/perfor- mance" that was presented at the Contempo- rary Art Museum in Prato with Giuliano Gori's relative, Laura Vestri, in the main role and his daughter, Stefania Gori, on the pro- duction staff. I cite these examples as evi- dence for the range of Giuliano Gori's patron- age; the manner in which it grew and expanded over an extraordinarily short time interval; and its impact on a wide variety of living artists from all over the world. * * * Still, even the most enlightened commis- sioned art passes through the filter of the patron's taste. Furthermore, few patrons commission works across the spectrum of the arts to embody also literature, music, and choreography. The simplest solution to that problem is to have more Goris of music, Goris of poetry, Goris of.... But there is another form of direct support of artists that can encompass the entire range of disciplines un- der one roof and do so with a minimal impact of the patron's personal taste upon the artist's style or output. In the final analysis, the sole criterion for sponsorship should be confi- dence in the quality and integrity of the artist, which can be accomplished by providing the most precious gift: undisturbed time to pur- sue one's art, with no strings attached to the artistic output. The resident artists' colony, a 58</page><page sequence="9">peculiarly American form of contemporary arts patronage, fits that definition. Yaddo in upstate New York, MacDowell in New Hampshire, and the Rockefeller Foun- dation's Villa Serbelloni in Italy, are three well-known examples that have existed for decades. I shall focus on one of the most recent such programs, the Djerassi Founda- tion Resident Artists Program near San Fran- cisco. In fewer than ten years, it has become the largest resident artists' program west of the Mississippi, with over 500 artists having been supported in less than a decade. It is the most interdisciplinary of all such American programs, since it offers (for periods of one to three months) free room and board as well as specialized studio space to ten artists at a time in the disciplines of choreography, dance and performance art; literature, such as fiction, poetry, drama, biography, and criticism; mu- sic, with major emphasis on composition, but not excluding performance; and the entire range of visual arts encompassing sculpture, painting, drawing, film, photography, video, ceramics, and fiber art. Since the Founda- tion's property of over 600 acres overlooks the Pacific Ocean, about an hour's drive south of San Francisco, in a spectacular setting of rolling range land and redwood forest in the Santa Cruz mountains, the site offers, like Giuliano Gori's Celle, a major opportunity to sculptors interested in large-scale, site-specific projects. Finally, I chose this example of pri- vate patronage because I am most familiar with it: the program was initiated as my re- sponse to the suicide of my daughter, who at 28 was a promising visual artist and poet. It took my daughter's suicide to make me take seriously the patronage of the living. An autobiographical record of the found- ing of the Djerassi Foundation Resident Art- ists Program has appeared under the title "A Scattering of Ashes" (Hudson Review, XLIII [4], 571-581 [1991]). The program's quanti- tative achievements are summarized in the Table on page 61, but such statistics are meaningless without a sense of the quality and variety of the work that can arise from such patronage. The examples cited below are not based on my personal preference, but rather were picked because the works are well rep- 59</page><page sequence="10">resented in color slides or because they illus- trate the interdisciplinary cross-fertilization that is possible when artists from many disci- plines, countries, and cultures are brought together for a few weeks or months. Applica- tions for residencies are solicited from artists at two levels. One is the level of great promise: artists who have a record of solid achievement but are not yet well-known, and for whom an appointment as a resident artist might con- tribute to professional advancement. The other is the level of national or international distinction: artists with well-established repu- tations, for whom a change of scene in a collegial setting might offer intellectual re- freshment and artistic inspiration. With one exception, there is no require- ment for any artist to leave any portion of completed work for the Foundation at the end of the residency. The exception was prompted by Klee's guest book, which his son Felix showed to me in Bern. Every artist, irrespective of discipline, is presented with a single, large sheet of drawing paper and re- quested to leave behind some artistic or intel- lectual statement. The collection of hundreds of such sheets constitutes the most personal of the many forms of archival documentation (photographs, videos, musical tapes, tapes of literary readings) that the Foundation has assembled during the past eight years. A single example from the Foundation's "guest book," the last stanza from a poem by Amy Clampitt (1984), will suffice. COMING UPON AN UNIDENTIFIED WORK OF OUTDOOR ART NEAR WOODSIDE, CALIFORNIA the sudden, gladed glimpse of something made. Whose doing are these stationings of jute and brushwood, these totem- tripod harp shapes, that blood-red lyre whose silence stuns, among the redwoods-a holy place, an offering, a condition harking back to states of soul (an Eden's trespass slyly trailing withes of poison oak) one gropes to ascertain the name for? As seen in the slide, the work mentioned in Clampitt's poem is a sisal and madrone con- struction by the British artist Patricia Leigh- ton, a disciple of Magdalena Abakanowicz, 60</page><page sequence="11">Djerassi Foundation Resident Artists Program Statistics 1983-1990 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 Total Total Number of Artists 52 53 46 50 70 67 92 76 506 Women 28 30 22 20 31 37 42 44 254 Men 24 23 24 30 39 30 50 32 252 m Number of US States 13 11 12 11 9 9 11 14 34 Number of Foreign Countries 2 7 7 6 10 6 9 6 22 Writers/Poets/Playwrights 26 27 21 24 23 28 31 28 208 Painters/Drawers/Printmakers 7 11 8 11 15 10 13 11 86 Sculptors/Ceramicists 12 7 10 5 10 9 12 5 70 Composers/Musicians 3 5 4 7 11 12 9 9 60 Choreographers/Performers 3 1 3 3 9 4 19 19 61 Photographers/Media Artists 1 2 0 0 2 4 8 4 21 Cumulative 52 105 151 201 271 338 430 506</page><page sequence="12">whom this Polish artist (represented in the Gori Collection) had recommended in 1983. Entitled "Wake," the magic setting of these three constructions in a redwood clearing has not only influenced a poet. When the New York choreographer Rhonda Martyn was in residence in 1985, she choreographed-as part of a series of dances associated with outdoor sculptures-a performance around "Wake," which was presented to an invited audience on summer solstice (1985) at dusk and hence was not photographed. However, another pertinent example of Martyn's cho- reography is shown in the slide depicting a group of dancers in, around, and above Del Geist's (1984) huge (15 x 70 x 80 ft.) earth- work and steel sculpture installation "Auro- ra." Leighton and Geist got married the fol- lowing year-the first, but not the last of several couplings conceived at the Founda- tion. Another impetus to a collaborative effort between choreographer and sculptor was pro- vided by the Australian sculptor John Davis (1986), who uses eucalyptus branches as the armature, and painted canvas as the skin, of his large, anthropomorphic sculptures. His residency overlapped with those of the chore- ographer-dancer pair Clare Whistler (British) and Duncan MacFarland (American), who were so taken by the lightness and magic of Davis's sculptures that eventually, with the further collaboration of the Californian com- poser David Rosenboom, they completed a sculpture-dance project, "Systems of Judg- ment," that was subsequently performed (un- der the auspices of the Australian Arts Coun- cil) throughout Australia, including the 1988 Spoleto Festival, as well as in San Francisco. At times, such collaborations are not hatched at the Foundation, but planned ahead of time, as was the case in 1985 with a group of four artists from Basel, Switzerland. The choreographer Ester Sutter, the com- poser Joel Vandroogenbroeck, the painter- sculptor Andreas Straub, and the writer Au- rel Schmidt-as part of their interdisciplinary project "Homenaje al Indio"-initiated and completed at the Foundation a performance piece entitled "Energy Fields," consisting of five ritual sequences of dance for the environ- 62</page><page sequence="13">ment. As can be seen from the slides, the audience had to follow the dancer along her outdoor path. Vandroogenbroeck's music, scored for piano, rhythm machine, and com- puter, included natural sounds (e.g. coyotes, crickets) recorded at the site. The perfor- mance was videotaped for subsequent show- ings in Europe. To my knowledge, none of the other American artists's colonies includes choreog- raphy. The origin of our own dance program merits emphasis. The very first composer in residence, John Adams, spent three months in 1983 at the Foundation composing the synthesizer music ("Light over Water") for "Available Light"-the inaugural piece com- missioned by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art from John Adams, the New York choreographer Lucinda Childs, and the Los Angeles architect Frank 0. Gehry. Adams's comments about the diffi- culties of a transcontinental collaboration be- tween composer and choreographer, and our own desire to promote multidisciplinary artis- tic endeavors, prompted us to apply to the James Irvine Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation for funds to con- struct a dance and performance studio within the confines of our large, twelve-sided studio structure. The generosity of these founda- tions, notably the additional funds provided by the Hewlett Foundation, led to the com- pletion of several other specialized studio spaces: ceramic, photography, and music- each equipped with special equipment (e.g. kiln, enlarger, computers) required by practi- tioners of these art forms. The choreography space-by far the larg- est studio-has also served as the site for performances suitable for up to one hundred spectators. Everything from premier dance, theatre, or music pieces has been presented over the years to supporters and visitors of the Foundation. For instance, John Adams, who subsequently became a trustee of the Foundation, presented his opera "Nixon in China" in video and lecture form in that space. Another occasion is commemorated in the picture of John Adams, Ollie Wilson, and Ingram Marshall in front of specially de- signed, painted canvas room partitions made 63</page><page sequence="14">by another artist in residence, Sandro Mar- tini. At that event, these three former com- posers-in-residence played pieces composed by them at that site. Wilson (a professor of music at the University of California in Berke- ley) had used part of a Guggenheim fellow- ship during his tenure at the Foundation on a commissioned piece for the Boston Sym- phony, which was subsequently performed by Seiji Ozawa in Boston. Marshall, at that time (1984) a San Francisco composer, presented "Alcatraz"-a piece for piano, synthesizer, and slides of the abandoned Alcatraz prison. As noted in the sequel, I have purposely selected that photograph, containing also Martini's wall hangings, to make a point about the collegiality and connectivity that such res- ident artists programs can engender. Sandro Martini, the first of over half a dozen visiting artists from Italy, overlapped during his residency with the American painter James Rosen (now the William S. Morris Professor of Art at Augusta College), whose metier at that time was the creation of contemporary, veiled versions of pre-Renais- sance Italian paintings, such as Duccio's and Coppo's madonnas. Intrigued by his work, Martini proposed Rosen's name to the Mu- seum of Contemporary Art in Ferrara, whose director invited Rosen as visiting artist for a few months. That stay was eventually ex- tended to two years and resulted in a veritable explosion of painterly homages to Italian Renaissance works, which were featured in a series of subsequent exhibitions-first in Italy and then in America. Rosen's variations, in hundreds of drawings, watercolors, and oils, of the Schifanoia frescoes in Ferrara, were one notable outcome of his Italian artistic sojourn, which was spawned in California. As is to be expected, the overpowering landscape of Northern California has influ- enced many artists. Among writers, it has been most often the poets (Janet Lewis, Denise Levertov, John Haines, and Alistair Elliot, to cite a few examples), who have explicitly paid homage to that natural setting through their poetry. A line from "Landscape Near Bear Gulch Road" by Janet Lewis, who at 90 was the oldest artist-in-residence, gives a feeling for the impact of that natural setting: 64</page><page sequence="15">One tone, one visible substance, a splendor Of multiplicity and self-abandon, Beneath that band of intense blue Lacking which, the hill is incomplete. There have been so many writers in resi- dence, over two hundred by 1990, that I will mention only the very first, Joyce Carol Tho- mas, a black writer from Berkeley, who man- aged to complete an entire autobiographical novel while in residence. It was a great omen that the following year, she won the National Book Award in the juvenile category for her very first book. The impact of the environment is, of course, most easily demonstrated and under- stood in the visual arts, and I shall end my presentation with recent works by three such artists. The first is one of the youngest who has ever been accepted: Seyed Alavi, an Ira- nian environmental artist, trained in Califor- nia and now living in Oakland. The slides show three of his sited, temporary installa- tions: "Limited Image," a cluster of silk tulips on one of our hillsides; "Tiger among Red- woods," featuring a life-sized fiberglass tiger in our forest; and "Echo," for me the most moving of them all, since it shows the word "echo" in etched glass floating in a pool at the foot of a waterfall, the spot where my daugh- ter's ashes had been scattered. Compared to Alavi, the other two artists, both sculptors, worked on very different time scales of permanence. The Italian Mauro Staccioli, who was proposed to our Founda- tion's selection panel by none other than Giuliano Gori, eventually came three times. First to explore the land, next to make pre- liminary drawings and plans, and finally to construct an untitled work consisting of five huge, abstract geometric structures, covered in gray stucco, that interact physically and visually with the old, live oak trees to which they are connected. This installation, ranging over an area of a couple of acres, has been one of the most photographed installations on our site. The largest of these five objects collapsed during the big October 1989 earthquake. A year later, in response to that challenge, Stac- cioli repaired the damaged piece by doubling its size and then juxtaposing it with a 55-foot- tall semi-ellipse. While Staccioli has numerous 65</page><page sequence="16">installations throughout the world, the largest one being a 150-foot-tall structure at the Olympic Games site in Seoul, only Gori's Fattoria de Celle and our foundation have offered him the opportunity to explore on a grand scale the marriage of urban stark ma- terials with a forest's intrinsic, living com- plexity. My last example of providing a sculptor with the opportunity of siting his work in unspoiled nature is David Nash, who tries, to quote his words, "to acknowledge the rela- tionships of the forest and those who work it: using their materials and tools and calling on their experience." Nash became particularly well-known to the American public through the exhibit "British Sculpture since 1965," which traveled through many of the major American museums, including the Chicago Art Institute and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. The emotional impact of his work on me is best described in the following coda to a memoir, which will appear as part of my autobiography (The Pill, Pygmy Chimps, and Degas's Horse). It is also a fitting end to this very personal essay on some forms of art patronage. Coda Thanksgiving Day, 1989. We have already been hiking for four hours in search of some felled redwood trunks of at least 5-foot diam- eter. It's the minimum size David Nash re- quires for the three-part sculpture he intends to site around some burnt-out giant redwood stumps that can still be found, here or there, on our property from nineteenth-century log- ging practices. Nash is one of the most distin- guished artists we have had in residence at the Foundation. A British sculptor, now working in Wales, he first came to the Foundation in 1987 at the time of his retrospective exhibi- tion at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. While wood ("King of the Vegetables," he calls it) is his sole medium, and chain saw and ax his principal tools, he had never be- fore handled redwood or madrone, the two most prevalent species in our forest. During his first stay, he had created a group of madrone sculptures for a highly successful show in Los Angeles; in addition, out of a 66</page><page sequence="17">huge redwood trunk that had lain for decades in Harrington Creek, Nash had fashioned "Sylvan Steps"-a Jacob's ladder rising at a steep angle out of the water into the sky. When he first selected that site--accessible only along the creek bed by clambering over rocks and fallen timber-he had had no in- kling that only a few hundred feet upstream we had scattered in 1978 my daughter's ashes. Within a minute, some flecks of Pami's ashes must have floated past the spot where Nash's steps now rise into the air. "Sylvan Steps" is a magically simple sculpture that many subse- quent artists have drawn, photographed, or written about. But now, two years later during his second residency, we cannot find the massive log he needs. During our morning hike we have located four sites in the forest where black- ened trunks rise out of the bracken-just the right backdrop for the scorched pyramid, cube, and ball Nash plans to shape, but the right arboreal progenitor for these forms is still missing. Of course, we cross the shadow of many a living redwood giant, but cutting one is out of the question. That's when I recall that some selective logging has just been com- pleted on our neighbor's land across Bear Gulch Road; only a few days ago, I had followed impatiently a slow-moving truck stacked high with redwood logs. Perhaps "our" piece had not yet been removed. I don't expect anyone working there on Thanksgiving Day, but after climbing over the locked gate and walking down the forest road, inches deep in dust (it had not rained for weeks), we hear in the distance the grind- ing of gears. Soon we come upon a mammoth tractor setting up erosion breaks to preserve the road bed during the winter rainy season. "Have you moved out all the logs?" I shout up to the cabin after the bearded driver has shut off the thundering engine. "We need.. ." I say, and then explain who David Nash is, and why we are searching for a special fallen redwood rather than a turkey for Thanksgiving. "All gone," he says, but then remembers. "A big one fell across the fence near the property line. Probably years ago ... in some storm." According to him, it was partly rot- 67</page><page sequence="18">ten-sufficiently so that it had not been worth their while to haul it to the mill. Nash is dubious that it will do, but I say, "Let's look anyway." We follow the man's directions to the fence a half mile down the logging road. When we finally come upon it, I am dumbfounded. Eleven years ago, I had hobbled here as fast as my stiff leg would carry me; but I had come from the opposite direction-down the meadow from our side of the property, toward this fence across which the massive trunk now lay, broken into three enormous pieces. It is the spot where my daughter had killed herself, where I have never dared to return. We find the rot to be only superficial; the wood is precisely what David Nash had been seeking all Thanksgiving long. Carl Djerassi is Professor of Chemistry at Stan- ford University.
