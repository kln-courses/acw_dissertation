<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS shape of kyathoi. Attic kyathoi found in Etruscan graves show by their peculiarities that Attic potters would imitate bucchero vessels to suit the demands of the export market rather than because they were metal (although bucchero is of course connected with metal in shape [117 fig. 5.10]). In addition, kyathoi are sympo- sion vessels. People in antiquity liked long symposia and cool wine; fired clay is porous, and earthenware filled with water and/or wine keeps the liquid cool and makes it even cooler through evaporation. The latter does not apply to silver or gold, and in this respect hydriai, mixing bowls, oinochoai, kyathoi and kylikes made of clay added more to the sense of well-being at symposia than metal vessels. For this reason we find clay cups even in Macedonian palaces. V.&amp;G. would answer that the slaves drank from them, but their masters also liked to drink cool wine. On the other hand, in the northern Black Sea area or near the sources of the Seine, where the climate was quite different, wine remained cool enough in vessels of bronze, silver and gold. Ch. 2 (33-54) deals with the high prices for plate in antiquity in comparison with the low prices for clay vessels, in order to show that pottery was of very little value. V.&amp;G. pretend that we know a lot about ancient prices, but I should like to quote B.A. Sparkes, Greek pottery: an introduction (1991) 129: 'It is not easy to speak of vase prices with any confidence'. In fifth century Athens a mason or a sailor could earn one drachma (= 6 obols) a day; thus the price of two or three drachmas for a red-figure hydria is comparatively high (cf. Sparkes, op. cit. 120). In the Kaminos, 'Homer' wishes the potters to sell much in the market-place and the streets, and to gain great profit, Homeri opera V [OCT] 212). Sparkes also wrote a review of V.&amp;G. (Antiquity 69 [1995] 619-21) in which he criticizes especially ch. 3 (55-76) because V.&amp;G. 'pluck statements out of con- text'. This is also the case in other chapters. Thus V.&amp;G. cite the golden phiale at the beginning of Pinda- r's Olympian 7 twice (4, 43), but never the metal (I think golden) depas of Achilles in Iliad 16.225 ff., from which the hero only poured wine when praying to Zeus. These two passages have in common that a golden bowl, 'the peak of possessions', was used only in special cases, not at random. Furthermore, Pindar is also quoted in ch. 4 (78, 102), but never his fr. 124 Snell, the enkomion sent to the Deinomenid Thrasyboulos. Here the poet speaks of 'kylikes from Athens' used in the symposia of the tyrant at Akragas. Of course V.&amp;G. would interpret this as referring to gold or silver cups, but Pindar does not say so, and his poem belongs to the heyday of the Attic clay kylix. Its special elegance, e.g. that of the Brygos cup in Wtirzburg's Martin-von- Wagner-Museum, could not be attained by hammering silver or gold, but only by a quickly turning wheel and the potter's hands. That cup-skyphoi and 'acrocups' have their silver pendants we learn from figs. 5.11-5.13; the shape of the Brygos cup, however, does not have such pendants. Clay is plastic by nature, metal is not. And fired clay-as we have seen-keeps the wine cooler than does metal. In ch. 5, 'The influence of precious materials' (105- 53), we are given a good survey of this phenomenon from prehistoric times onwards. For V.&amp;G., the prot- otype is always metal or ivory, but I should like to question this. For example, the shape of the kantharos (frontispiece) has so many prehistoric earthenware fore- runners in Troy and elsewhere that the golden kantharoi from shaft grave IV at Mycenae and Kalamata (Hampe- Simon, The birth of Greek art, fig. 113) are surely precious exceptions-like the above quoted depas of Achilles-and do not belong to 'normal' sets. Of course there are many examples of pottery copying plate- throughout the centuries, but V.&amp;G. neglect the proper development of those 'copies'. A potter can take over the shape and peculiarity of a metal vessel, but after- wards the clay product has a career sui generis. In addition, we do not have many incised silver vessels, and V.&amp;G. give plausible reasons for this, but I doubt that incisions in metal like figs. 5.20 and 5.22- 5.24 are really better works of art than red-figure masterpieces. The authors do not give illustrations of the latter, but prefer to illustrate the work of banausoi like Oikopheles (157, fig. 6.1) who was 'ein riickstandiger Dorftopfer' (Pfuhl, MuZ I 253). In any case, we can learn from catalogues such as C. Vermeule, Geek and Roman sculpture in gold and silver in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1974) that gold-and silversmiths, if compared with potters, are not always the better artists. I doubt 'that no-one in antiquity would have understood' this (83). V.&amp;G.'s book shows throughout a tendency to diminish Beazley's achievement. They show another 'Way Forward' in ch. 7 (191-204), a way which is gone by many archaeologists today. In spite of this, Beazley's lists remain fundamental also for entirely new approaches. V.&amp;G. think the same: 'Beazley's frame- work of attributions can be an important starting point for research on Greek pottery' (193). But why must they write in a warning tone about his predilections-the Berlin Painter and so on (4 f., 82 f.)? We all have predilections, V.&amp;G. too, and they are not the worst of us. I fear the two authors have a Beazley syndrome, and this makes their comments sometimes tendentious where they should be grateful to a scholar who has helped us so much in understanding-with our mind which is, of course, different from the mind of two and a half millennia ago-ancient pottery. ERIKA SIMON Wurzburg CORPUS VASORUM ANTIQUORUM. Italia LXVIII. Gioia del Colle, Museo archeologico nazionale, I. By A. Cancio. Rome: L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1995. Pp. 35 + ill. L230,000. The archaeological museum at Gioia del Colle was founded in 1977 to accommodate the finds from excava- tions at the important site of Monte Sannace. The present volume of the CVA, the first to be devoted to this museum, publishes a selection of complete vases and fragments, in all fifty-nine pieces, mainly of the sixth and fifth centuries, including native Peucetian wares (pls. 1-20), imported Attic black-figure (pls. 21- 26) and red-figure (pls. 27-33, 36-37, 39), and Early South Italian red-figure (pls. 34-35, 38?, 40). The 231</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS catalogue is prefaced by a short discussion of the types of pottery as they are represented at Monte Sannace and elsewhere in Apulia. While one can only welcome the publication of material from a significant, but perhaps less well-known, museum, the usefulness of the present work is, unfortun- ately, reduced by two problems. In the first place, the author has not stated clearly what criteria were used in the selection of the material. All the pottery comes from the excavations of 1957-61 or 1976-83 at Monte San- nace, some vases from the acropolis, others from the settlement, many from the tombs, but there is no dis- cussion, or even an index, of the archaeological con- texts, which is particularly disappointing for vases that served as grave-offerings. In fact, the format of the CVA is not intended for the presentation of such excavation material. And it is particularly hard to understand the reason for this volume, when one soon discovers that some of the pieces have already been adequately pub- lished in earlier comprehensive reports on the excava- tions at Monte Sannace, to one of which the author her- self made a major contribution. Indeed, sometimes the earlier publication is more informative: for example, in the case of the fragment on pl. 3, 1, the original publica- tion gives the diameter of the lip, a drawing of the upper surface of the lip, and a profile; and pl. 3, 2 is hardly comprehensible without recourse to the drawing and profile supplied in the original publication. In these circumstances, it would perhaps have been more useful to have concentrated upon one class of pottery (for example, the local matt-painted Peucetian ware), incor- porating a discussion of its presence at the site, or alternately to have kept to unpublished material. The second problem involves the description and attribution of the black-and red-figure pottery. Not only are the descriptions not as accurate as one would like, but the attributions are not always reliable. For example, the fragments illustrated on pls. 36-37, and 39 are all misidentified as Lucanian or Apulian, when they are clearly Attic. The illustrations are generally of reasonable quality, but the printing of the photographs is not always as clear as it could be. The layout is sometimes wasteful, and the figured fragments are not always posed correctly. Given that there are only forty plates and thirty-three pages of text (including introduction, bibliography and indexes), this volume of the CVA hardly represents value for money. I append a few detailed comments: P1. 11, 3 and 4. These have been switched. 3 is Monte Sannace, pls. 178 and 214, 2. Pls. 21-22. The first Amazon must be moving to the left, looking back; the second does not hold a 'scudo a pelta' but a 'Boeotian' shield. Is the charioteer on side B really an Amazon, and not a male in long white garment? P1. 23. The description is incomplete, and the frag- ments should have been rearranged in their proper sequence for photography (and could have been printed on a larger scale). P1. 24, 1. 'Overlap' decoration; the two draped figures are male. P1. 24, 3. Again the fragments have been wrongly composed. PI. 25. Each of the draped males wears a himation but not a chlamys. P1. 28. Details 4 and 5 have been printed in reverse. The left-hand figure on the reverse is a woman, holding a sceptre. P1. 29. The left-hand woman holds clappers (krotala), not a 'black ribbon'. PI. 31. The 'four vertical lines' represent a torch held by the woman. The helmeted figure is probably a mortal warrior, not a divinity. PI. 34-35. This bell-krater is not by the Amykos Painter, but by the Pisticci Painter. The vase is, in fact, listed by Trendall, LCS 21, no. 47. P1. 37, 1. Not Apulian, by the Painter of the Berlin Dancing Girl, but Attic, by the Painter of Louvre G 456 (attribution by Adrienne Lezzi-Hafter). P1. 37, 2-3. Also Attic, a fine early work by the Painter of Louvre G 456 (Adrienne Lezzi-Hafter). About 450-440. What is the subject of the picture on the outside? The running male seems to have something around his lower leg. The head and torso on MG 350 belong to the second figure from the left on MG 349. P1. 39, 1-3. Not Lucanian, of the Intermediate Group, but Attic, about 440-430. P1. 39, 4-6. Not Apulian of the first quarter of the fourth century, but Attic about 440-430. Same cup as pl. 39, 1-3? P1. 40. The two fragmentary cups on this plate are by the same painter: Early Apulian, in the vicinity of the Anabates Painter, to judge from the draped male on the outside. Why was the outside of pl. 30, 1 not illustrated? IAN MCPHEE La Trobe University .BYRNE (M.) The Greek Geometric warrior figurine: interpretation and origin. Louvain and Providence RI: College Erasme and Brown U, 1991. Pp. 256. Fr. b. 2,800. This informative and well illustrated book seeks to examine the reason for the widespread use of the warrior motif during the Geometric period, attempt its interpret- ation, and determine its origin. As the bulk of the material evidence for this study if confined to Olympia and Delphi, both centres of Panhellenic importance, Byrne wisely concentrates his efforts upon the relevant anthropomorphic votive figurines from these two sites. B. argues that the armed male terracotta figurines and the majority of the bronze series of armed male figures from Olympia represent Zeus. Initially, the author bases his argument upon Pausanias' (5.17.1) sighting of a 'crude' statute of Zeus in the Temple of Hera, together with that of Hera, which was standing, bearded and wearing a helmet; most of the terracotta and bronze series are standing and armed, the majority are wearing helmets, a few are bearded. Furthermore, B. sees in these early armed figurines the prototype for the later Zeus stereotype, i.e. bearded and standing, and armed with a thunderbolt. He rightly points out that Zeus in Homer is 'arbiter of war, to whom warriors pray for victory' (28), although his claim that there is a 'special 232</page></plain_text>
