<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guillevicfs Carnac: From La révolution to Le rivage Gavin Bowd Critical comment on Guillevic's Carnac has omitted to consider its significance in the contexts of the author's longstanding political commitment and of the general development of his poetics. Rather than expressing rupture or crisis, this long poem is noted for its tranquility. Paul Chaulot writes of Guillevic's "superbe stoïcisme devant l'échec" (1053). Jean Tortel finds in Carnac that "aisance belle, sérénité sont les nouvelles armes du poète" (78). The differences between Chaulot and Tortel are concerning the similarities between Carnac and Guillevic's first collection, Terraqué. Chaulot finds in the former the latter's minimalist, unlyrical style and the same combative attitude to things: "II n'existe pas plus de solution de continuité entre Terraqué et Carnac qu'entre les lueurs de l'aurore et les feux de midi" (1046). Tortel takes up this image to point out "une nouvelle qualité lumineuse" (78) in Carnac. If there is disagreement, however, the point of comparison omits reference to the socialist realist poetry written by Guillevic during the period between the above-mentioned works. Another critic, Jean Pierrot, does place Carnac in relation to this preceding phase, describing it as marking Guillevic's rediscovery of "sa fécondité créatrice en revenant à son écriture et sa thématique authentiques" (120). Carnac is seen in psychoanalytical terms as "un effort du poète pour assumer son passé, pour réorganiser la situation familiale et guérir les vieilles blessures de l'enfance" (126). Such a critical approach, however, pushes into the background both the political context and the landscape which is central to the poem, while remaining blind to any mutation in poetics. In this article, I intend to show how Carnac marks an important turning- point in the development of Guillevic's world-view. In the wake of the unmasking of Stalin in 1956, political disappointment is accompanied by a radical change in poetic form. The occasion for such thematic and stylistic changes is a rumination on a landscape absent from his committed work: the coast. Landscape and poetics before 1956 Between 1945 and 1956, Guillevic, newly member of the French Communist Party at its most Stalinist, devoted his poetry to the defence and illustration of the party line. The dominant theme of his earlier work, for instance in Terraqué, of the conflict between the human and the non-human, was replaced by the conflict between communism and capitalism. In the poems of this committed period, nature is a site for struggle and is progressive. This investment of spirit in nature is a familiar theme in poetry: the landscape either reflects or opaquely refuses the desires of the poet. The linking of this topos to the communist struggle creates what can be called a "socialist pathetic fallacy": nature expresses the struggle for a future communist victory. Dalhousie French Studies 22 (1992)</page><page sequence="2">98 Gavin Bowd The landscape is drawn into the communist world-view and its particular rhetoric. "Soleil," in Gagner, provides an example of both the ideological investment of the landscape and of a poetic form. In "Soleil," the sun is described as a dynamic and progressive force. It is a wheel turning "in favour of summer, against, it is implied, the forces of decline (261): C'est la roue au soleil. Du jour et du soleil. Exerçant les vallées En faveur de l'été. Like the dialectic producing qualitative changes, the sun is continually superseding states (261): Excédant les poussières Dépassant les rosées. If the sun is a progressive force, it demands adherence by humanity. The speaker suggests that the reader should see the link between sun and progress (263): Si l'on voyait un peu Comme ensemble se tiennent Avenir et soleil. The message is made explicit by the use of political symbol (263): Si l'on voyait un peu La fille de campagne Qui monte en robe rouge un raidillon de terre. This figure is a working-class Marianne, dressed in the revolutionary colour, indicating the difficult path to progress. In the final lines, Guillevic joins together sunlit landscape and revolution (264): Voyez la fille, gardez le rouge de sa robe, Voyez le sol chauffé à sec du raidillon, Soyez soleil. Nature has therefore ceased to be separate or hostile in relation to man, and, instead, has become an accomplice, full of ciphers anticipating Utopia. The structure of "Soleil" is progressive, unfolding through five stages: the contentment of the natural scene; the link between man, homo faber, and political consciousness; the political implications of the sun's dynamism; and, finally, the exhortation to overthrow the ruling class. The tone is simple and explanatory. Temporal clauses beginning "Quand" are followed by demonstratives and predicated subjects in a uniform and untroubled process of cause and effect (260):</page><page sequence="3">Eugène Guillevic 99 Quand on fait les foins Le soleil s'adore. Hypothesis is followed by demonstration: "Si l'on voyait [...] / C'est par là" (263). In addition to this progressive structure is the use of symbol to create political identity. The peasant Marianne dressed in red is used as a symbol of the revolutionary movement. In case this should be innocently read as an erotic image, Guillevic explains the link between poet and collective by exhorting vous to bear in mind the redness of her dress - in other words, to adhere to the struggle. Together, these formal devices provide a good example of socialist realist poetry. A traditional topos, man and nature, meets political awareness, which in turn ends on the opening out onto political action outside the institution of literature. The sunlit landscape corresponds to a determinist and totalising world- view. The sun brings the world inevitably to life - like the movement of history to the end-point of emancipation - and penetrates every crevice of the landscape - it abolishes contradiction. The landscape corresponds to a poetic form that expresses the communist version of the Judeo-Christian narrative of history - the final struggle between good and evil, culminating in the end of history - and the collective identity of which the Party is the unique embodiment. Landscape and language express the hope of total transformation which is, as the red of the peasant girl implies, the extension of Soviet space over the globe. After 1956: Cornac During Guillevic's involvement as poète-militant, individual sensibility was discarded in favour of the word as arm in the combat for communism against capitalism. This political and artistic ambition was dealt a severe blow by the revelation of Stalin's crimes by Nikita Khrushchev in his "secret speech" to the twentieth congress of the CPSU: C'est dire combien terrible a été le choc causé par les révélations du XXe congrès du parti communiste de l'URSS et principalement la découverte des crimes de Staline. J'en ai été assommé pendant des mois et des mois. Je ne suis encore pas sûr d'en être remis [...]. J'en ai dès lors conclu que je devais me méfier de moi-même dans tout ce qui touche au domaine politique et que, décidément, j'étais bien plus poète qu'homme d'action. (1980:147) This brusque severance of the link between poet and politics was followed by a silence on Guillevic's part which lasted until the publication of Carnac in 1961. With this long poem, he recovered his roots and his voice: Carnac a été une grande joie pour moi, une délivrance. Je me retrouvais vraiment, je retrouvais mon pays, la terre, la mer, je me revivais tel que j'avais été. (1980:158)</page><page sequence="4">100 Gavin Bowd But if this rediscovery of the self is an assertion of the autonomy of the poet, after his voluntary self-abnegation during the Stalinist period, it should not be seen as the rediscovery of wholeness. Carnac is about the breakdown of certainties and the emergence of a poetry that expresses this. Significantly, Guillevic's return to his native Carnac does not entail a rumination exclusively on the menhirs, what we normally associate with Carnac. To speak of standing stones would place emphasis on notions of permanence, pesanteur and tradition. In this poem, Guillevic chooses the coast. Contemplating the unfurling of the waves, the poet describes the struggle between the founding of a world and surrounding chaos, between a stable identity and encroaching otherness. The coast that Guillevic chooses is not the space of leisure that Carnac, for example, has become. Alain Corbin describes how between 1750 and 1840 there was aroused "un désir collectif des rivages" (68). From being a source of fear, the sea became an object of admiration and a place for holiday enjoyment. But it is the lugubrious, dangerous representation of the sea that precedes this which appeals to Guillevic in this poem. Corbin describes how before the mid- 18th century the representation of the sea was heavily influenced by the Bible. The remnants of the flood, a space of formlessness, chaos, populated by threatening and unnameable monsters, the sea was the embodiment of the profane and a reminder of the fallenness of man.1 The sea was the disruption of divine perfection: "II n'y a. pas de mer dans le jardin d'Eden" (Corbin 12). In the contemporary context, if the future Paradise is earthly, prefigured in "Soleil," then the entrance of the sea into Guillevic's universe shows the deferral of the absolute end to history promised in the communist version of the Judeo- Christian narrative. The sea represents not burgeoning growth but eternal recurrence and radical alterity. It is accompanied by a radical change in poetic form. The landscape of Carnac is one of incompleteness. Both man and matter are portrayed as struggling to transcend the preformai and the chaotic (198): À Carnac, l'odeur de la terre A quelque chose de pas reconnaissable. C'est une odeur de terre Peut-être, mais passée À l'échelon de la géométrie. Où le vent, le soleil, le sel, L'iode, les ossements, l'eau douce des fontaines [.-] Tous ensemble et séparément luttent Avec l'époque des menhirs Pour être dimension. 1 . In Guillevic's case, this Biblical representation is reinforced by the Breton myths of submerged towns, e.g. Ys, and sea monsters, e.g. Tydanel.</page><page sequence="5">Eugène Guillevic 101 To use the terminology of Mircea Eliade, in Le sacré et le profane, but extending it beyond the strictly human frame, there is a desire to find a sacred space where a "world," the only one to exist really, can be founded, which overcomes surrounding profane "chaos." The sea typifies the struggle between being and non-being. The poem begins by drawing together sea and nothingness (143): Mer au bord du néant Qui se mêle au néant, Pour mieux savoir le ciel, Les plages, les rochers, Pour mieux les recevoir. The never-ending movement of the waves, the sea's production of ephemeral horizontal and vertical forms, represents a continual lack of wholeness. A desire to possess the surroundings, to combine harmoniously earth, air and water, only draws the sea away from desired peace. The descriptions of the sea's attributes combine being and non-being: power and weight, yet without work or purpose. The sea is therefore passive, formless, invertebrate (166): «Désossée», «dégraissée», Ce sont des voix. «Décolorée», «Grise, grise, grise», C'est une autre voix. Elles t'en veulent, ces voix, Elles sont dans le vent, dans le soleil, Dans ta couleur, dans ta masse. The sea, in turn, desires dimension. It desires the structure of skeletal form, but is frustrated (177): Tu rêves des rochers Pour t'en faire un squelette. Continue, continue, Flatte-les de tes vagues Et reste invertébrée. The sea searches for a defined space where being can be gathered together, where the real can accumulate and draw away from preformai unreality. The waves appear to be desperately struggling to find the system of canals, pools and harbours where the earth encapsulates water. Reaching the pools, the sea finds a space where a moment of peace is experienced (147):</page><page sequence="6">[02 Gavin Bowd Je t'ai vu bien souvent, Cernée dans les bassins, Rendre au soleil couchant L'hommage des eaux calmes. This desire for form is shared by humanity, who anticipate the construction 3f a space where a transfigured earth can be inhabited: Ce sera comme un cercle Qui se réveille droite, Une équation montée Dans l'ordre des degrés, D'autres geometries Pour vivre la lumière. Alongside this theme of geometry is the valorisation of pesanteur, of the weight of matter which grounds a world. The poet sees salvation in the cloaca which provides stability (168): II y a dans les cours des fermes Du purin qui ne s'en va pas Et c'est pour leur donner De l'épaisseur terrestre. Often it is sacred objects which offer the necessary dimension. The weight of rock in the form of gravestones and dolmens provides stability in the face of death (148-49): À Carnac, derrière la mer, La mer nous touche et se respire Jusque dans les figuiers. Ils sont dans l'air, Les ossements. t...] Le cimetière et les dolmens Sont apaisants. The church also has the value of pesanteur, hewn rock that resists wind and sea, Dimension is offered by the manifestation of the sacred most prevalent in Guillevic's work: woman. In a series of quanta, the speaker predicts the arrival oi a woman who overcomes division. In this imaginary situation, chaos gives wa&gt; to the possession of space and its organisation as an orderly world (154): Présence jamais trop lourde De vous autour de nous</page><page sequence="7">Eugène Guillevic 103 À composer le monde, Puisque le temps se tient Aux dimensions de notre avoir. Such manifestations of the sacred are, however, incomplete. The dimensions of the sacred space are on the building site: matter is still moving, man is still hoping. The place where the sacred seems to be in place is Carnac and its standing stones. The circles of stones are already existing dimensions of the sacred. In them sky and earth are united (159): Nulle part comme à Carnac Le ciel n'est à la terre Ne fait monde avec elle Pour former comme un lieu Plutôt loin de tout Qui s'avance au-dessous du temps. To use Eliade's terminology, there has been founded a world that stands out from profane time and space. The circle of stones becomes the centre of the world where the sky joins the redeemed earth (160): Du milieu des menhirs Le monde a l'air De partir de là, D'y revenir. La lumière est bien, Pardonne. Le ciel A trouvé sa place. However, "le monde a l'air," the rocks form "comme un lieu": it is not certain that the menhirs offer order. Carnac remains an incomplete inhabitation. It is not presented as a place of peace. Settlements are dispersed, not rooted in the earth, smothered by an oppressive silence. If the rocks of the cemeteries, the dolmens and the church offered pesanteur in the face of death, death nevertheless persists (160): À Carnac d'autres vents Font semblant d'apporter Des souffles de vivants Mais ne sont que passants. Plenitude is only momentary in Carnac. The landscape erupts in fissures, inevitable differences and conflicts. The sea is condemned to never-ending</page><page sequence="8">104 Gavin Bowd oscillation between being and non-being. Lack of form is projected into eternity. The movement of the waves recurs continually. The sea exists in a parallel relationship with the coast, which prevents any opening out onto the new. The "essence" of the sea is its negativity: its being is necessarily to not be. The poet tells the sea that when it is soaked up by the earth, "tu te perds / En perdant ta masse // Et ce néant / Qui te traverse" (201-02). In relation to the human, the sea is elusive, opaque, irredeemably objective. A split takes place because the sea has secrets which resist the observer. The human race has its confidence in the victory of knowledge undermined by the lumpishness of the sea (206): Encore une fois, Que faire avec toi, Nous qui pouvons? Debout au soleil, Fiers de nos travaux, Toujours approchant d'un plus grand secret Et toi un remords À n'en pas finir. The desire for knowledge of the sea draws the speaker to immerse himself in the sea. But no secret is revealed: there are surfaces upon surfaces, which thwarts the ordering power of language (208): Du volume indéterminé Où mes cris ne portaient pas. Such an awareness of the chaotic nature of the sea leads to humanity being repelled by it and choosing the earth. And yet, even inhabitants far away from the ocean search for residues of the sea (148): Mais tu sais trop qu'on te préfère, Que ceux qui t'ont quittée Te trouvent dans les blés, Te recherchent dans l'herbe, T'écoutent dans la pierre, Insaisissable. There is not a strict separation of earth and sea, man and other, but rather a dialectical interpénétration (148): Tu regardes la mer Et lui cherches des yeux. Tu regardes des yeux Et tu y vois la mer.</page><page sequence="9">Eugène Guillevic 105 In Carnac, one element relays back to another, in a process of attraction and repulsion, but without the stable exchange characteristic of equilibrium. Cornac dramatises an impossible equilibrium that denies the totality and end-point found in the landscape and poetics of "Soleil." The disruption of unity and the never-ending alterity of the ocean mentioned above seem to draw together man and sea. This is the spirit of one of the quanta2 (157): Nous n'avons de rivage, en vérité, Ni toi ni moi. Both man and sea lack the desired dimension: they are both affected by chaos. But this is no facile summary of the "message" of Cornac, Other statements are made about man and the sea which contradict this. For example (207): Nous avons en commun L'expérience du mur. Is this wall not an example of a rivage? Similarly contradictory is Guillevic's differentiation of man and sea (197): Sois ici remerciée De n'être pas pareille à nous Dont le rêve est toujours D'être réconciliés Quand pourtant Ce n'est pas possible. This surely contradicts the frequent theme of the poem of the sea's desire for union with its surroundings. The process of attraction and repulsion has affected Guillevic's anthropomorphism: the sea is at one moment human, at another inhuman. In one quantum, the sea stands above the concerns of mortals; in another, it shares the poet's concern for death. There is a flickering of human and non-human features in the sea, features identified without constituting the human whole (181): Sans corps, Mais épaisse. Sans ventre, Mais molle. 2. In this article, I use Guillevic's own term, quantum, for the brief sections that make up most of his poems.</page><page sequence="10">106 Gavin Bowd What sense can be made of this apparent inconsistency? Returning to the original comparison, it can be said that man and sea are "sans rivages" because the latter sucks in all forms of human projection. It provides a bottomless pit for the imagination of the speaker. There is no dimension which determines or directs the attribution of meaning and form. This is the spirit of one quantum (186): Infatigable, fatiguée - Mais quelle épithète Ne te conviendrait? The sea is so vast that it sucks in contraries. On the coast, confronted with "le territoire du vide," the skin of the poet's self is constantly exposed to the other (176): À la porte de l'océan Et parlant, parlant, Le difficile, C'est d'être lui. Et si tu l'étais C'est de rester toi, Assez pour savoir Que tu es les deux Et pour en crier. If solipsism is illusory, so is the unity with the other celebrated in "Soleil." It remains to live this self/other, land/sea relationship, "en crier" with a poetics that, "parlant, parlant," is eloquent but never-ending. The awareness of radical alterity, of endless frustration of progress, can be seen as a new pessimism on the part of Guillevic. From the struggle towards Utopia in the Stalinist period, Guillevic moves towards presenting history as brutal eternal recurrence (172): L'insidieux est notre passé, Chargé sur nous de représailles. There is a positive side, however. Language becomes the means by which a chaotic universe can be inhabited, with however much difficulty. He speaks to the sea while aware of its otherness. The poet's baptism of the sea, which links earth and sea, does not create lasting unity, but relieves the poet (183-84): Je te baptise Du goût de la pierre de Camac, Du goût de la bruyère et de la coquille d'escargot,</page><page sequence="11">Eugène Guillevic 107 Du goût de l'humus un peu mouillé. t...] - C'est sans effet sur toi, oui. C'était pour moi. The role of the word has therefore changed in Guillevic's work. It is no longer at the service of the historical movement that inexorably advances towards communism. With the severe disturbance of the links between nature, time and man, in a world of continual disorder, the poem has a more defensive, compensatory function. The following quantum can be read in this way (157): Écoute ce que fait La poudre en explosant. Écoute ce que fait Le fragile violon. On the one hand, there is matter in the service of destruction, part of the "history of reprisals." On the other hand, from the oscillation of life/death, being/non- being, a delicate beauty can be found: this beauty can be found in poetry. The "music" of this poem is no longer the confident demagogy of the marching song; it is instead a reaction to ever-present chaos. There is no conclusive knowledge garnered at the end of Carnac. The exchange and stability of equilibrium are missing. Instead, there is awareness of the definitive emptiness of the sea and of this poem as a creation without reciprocity (209): Toi, ce creux Et définitif. Moi qui rêvais De faire équilibre. In one quantum of Carnac, the speaker complains about the failure of his poem to represent the sea adequately (200-01): II me faudrait parler Aussi vague et confus Que rabâchent tes eaux Et des éclats Pour ta colère, Tes idées fixes Sous le soleil. It can be argued as a qualification of this that the shifting, repetitive, uncohesive, unprogressive style of this long poem suits the elusive, formless and vast subject-matter. If the sea means the eruption of a void in Guillevic's landscape, it also provides the occasion for a poetics of incompleteness.</page><page sequence="12">108 Gavin Bowd Carnac is certainly a coherent text. It is framed by an opening quantum which introduces the main "characters" of the poem - sea, sky and earth - and ends on a quantum that summarises the failed project of the poet. The elements of the landscape are consistent with Carnac, and in turn this sense of a region of identity is strengthened by the poet's je and the sea's toi which convey an intimate relationship with the environment. If such frame and horizon provide coherence, they do not provide stability. The process of attraction and repulsion is reflected by the orientation of the speaker. The addressee changes often, the shifters tu and nous occupied alternately by sea, woman, je plus lover, ye plus humanity, ye plus sea. The shift in the speaker's orientation towards the sea is reflected in changes of register. The attitude of the speaker shifts from conversational familiarity - "Ça ne te dit rien, n'est-ce pas?" (184) - to the apostrophe, prenominai adjective and all: "Incernable océan" (146). In addition to these shifts in orientation, there are shifts in tense throughout the poem, ranging aspectually from the past historic intuition of origins to the brief certainty of the present tense. The present of address to the sea and future- oriented addresses to woman are interrupted by memories of the past. Such shifts create a rumination without end in which a mind moves between elegy and hope and unanswerable questioning. The result of this is that the poem only has brief moments of cohesion, provided by the subject-matter and the pronoun at the time: the poem may be split into roughly forty sequences on this basis. The lack of temporal and logical connectives makes this poem unprogressive. The absence of such connectives as puis, après, demain, maintenant, or movement in tense from past to present to future, as found in the Stalinist period, rid thé poem of any clear aim - instead, it is more cyclical, like the sea. There are moments of qualified insight or plenitude, time-segments scattered across an unspecified span: Quelquefois I Tu mugis (153) Parfois tu étais / Un moment de moi (203) Things become static: a motif like that of the menhirs does not develop towards an unravelling of its secret, but rather remains shrouded in mystery. In turn, to temporal uncertainty is added the notion of semblance, of a gap between perceiver and perceived: d'autres vents / Font semblant d'apporter (160) Appel peut-être / À la musique (167) Within quanta the problematical relationship between the poet and the sea is reflected in the use of comparison. There is no pure use of metaphor, no fusion between one thing and the sea, but rather a bridge built by simile: La mer comme un néant (144) Comme font nos fontaines (146)</page><page sequence="13">Eugène Guillevic 109 A comparison may be used critically. The implied simile of the body is both affirmed and denied (181): Sans corps Mais épaisse. Guillevic uses antithesis. He attempts to delimit and possess the sea by saying what it is not (180-81): Pas délicate, Pas difficile, Pas assez femme. Tu prends tout, Parfois tu rejettes. Temporal and spatial uncertainty and incomplete comparisons contribute to a general dialectic of form/formlessness. This dialectic also appears in the polyphonic nature of some quanta. Voices come in and undermine a described state of affairs, for example (162): - Où c'était le reste. Phonetic patterning is also undermined (170): Douce, douce et caressante - Et c'est peut-être vrai. Conclusion In Cornac, the coast is the occasion for a new poetics. If Cornac had been on the people of Carnac it could have been a long poem in the nationalist, epic mode, as Bretons have already practised and publicised in such ideological works as the Barzaz-Breiz? Instead, Carnac marks the attenuation of links with the collectivity and of belief in historical continuity. With the irruption of the sea there is a move from direct concern with humanity to the confrontation of otherness. The sea becomes the occasion for an oscillation between world and chaos, form and formlessness, expressed in complexity of orientation, coherence but not progression. The sea problematises identity, giving rise to a poetics of incompleteness. In his work after the shock of 1956 Guillevic strives for unity with the cosmos and retains a tempered utopianism. But in the wake of the failure of Stalinism, there is no form in which to translate fully and unproblemaücally this holism or Utopian impulse. Carnac is the first of a series of long poems in which there are discontinuous and contradictory pulsions, where the collective narrative of nous, unproblematically illustrated in "Soleil," 3 .
