<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FILIATION OF AESTHETIC IDEAS IN THE NEOPLATONIC SCHOOL. THE famous passage (Enn. V. 8. I) in which Plotinus declares that fine art, so far from simply reproducing nature, 'goes back to the Reason-principles from which nature herself emanates,' has hitherto been generally regarded as a tacit criticism of Plato's teaching, and as an original contribution to the philosophy of art involving a rupture with the entire previous tradition of Greek aesthetic theory.' Yet Plotinus introduces it, not as if he were pro- claiming a new gospel, but almost casually, as a subordinate link in his discus- sion of Intelligible Beauty. And though his respect for Plato was not the half-superstitious reverence of the later Neoplatonists, he was at all times more zealous to walk in Plato's footsteps than to correct or criticize him, tacitly or otherwise. Moreover, can it be said with certainty that his doctrine is in itself opposed to Plato's? That question can be answered only by a detailed examination of Plato's theory of art-a task which I hope to accomplish elsewhere. In the present article, postponing all enquiry into the relation between these two aesthetic theories, I shall endeavour to show that the teaching of Plotinus was not a sudden innovation, but the natural and indeed inevitable outcome of preceding thought. Plato had been obliged to lay great stress, in his discussion of the meta- physical import of art, upon the incompatibility of Homer's old mythology 1 Cf.

IldvTy ytp ?O4ICp7ocEv, El ~'186v XX1y'p1r7ev, says Heraclides of Homer: unless the national epics of Greece are blasphemy from start to finish, which is inconceivable, they must be understood as allegories. Here, in the recourse to allegorization, condemned in advance by Plato, lay a simple though completely unhistorical escape from the dilemma which now perplexed so many consciences. Given the licence proper to this method, it was easy to extract all the conclusions of a mature philosophy from those early poems and, by a natural inference, to blame philosophy for not acknowledging its debt. It was in vain that Plutarch, who himself used allegory in the interpretation of Egyptian myths, protested against it when applied to Homer, and would have no moral lessons drawn from poetry save those inherent in the logic of a poet's theme. Already the Stoic school was busy transforming the gods of Olympus into mere personifications of natural forces and explaining their traditional names and attributes by those absurd etymologies of which the treatise of Cornutus De Natura Deorum is a complete encyclopaedia. Doubtless it was this labour of Cornutus and his fellow-Stoics which inspired Telephus, the Pergamene grammarian and tutor of the Emperor Verus, to compose his thesis On the Harmony between Plato and Homer.1 A turning-point in this process of accommodation between new beliefs and old mythology was reached in the Platonic revival inaugurated by Numenius of Apamea, when Stoic allegorization gave place to a reasoned theory of symbolism. The Neoplatonists had read in their Timaeus2 that material nature is an expression of ideas conceived in the divine mind; and on this foundation they built up a theory, half metaphysical, half mystical, akin to the doctrine of 'correspondences' afterwards taught by the medieval alchemists. The world itself, they held, might be described as a myth3 or symbolic poem, wherein each thing perceptible to sense contains within itself, potentially at least, a revelation of some spiritual truth or essence. And if inanimate things have this capacity of symbolic meaning, how much more the utterances of inspired poets? Thus to the interpretation of these last the new school brought a theory of expression which not only led, in Porphyry's hands, to a genuinely critical study of religious symbolism, but also paved the way for a profounder understanding of the relation between form and content in a work of art. For symbols are understood to be the natural and appropriate, if not inevitable, expression of what they symbolize, whereas in allegory the meaning is translated into terms which may be parallel with it, but which are always in a measure arbitrary. Of the writings of Numenius, Moderatus, Cronius, Nicomachus and the other philosophers who built up this new symbology, only a few scattered fragments now remain. It is, however, certain that the method was thoroughly established by the time of Ammonius Saccas, the second founder of the school, 1 Suidas, s.v.

FINBERG for Origen was one of his disciples, and it was Origen who transferred it to the interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, to the great scandal of his pagan critics, and especially of Porphyry, who denounces him for having enlisted a peculiarly Greek doctrine on the side of the barbarians.' In his commentaries the thesis that all sensible things are symbols of divine ideas is stated in its exact Neoplatonic form as justifying a symbolical explanation of the inspired writings.2 To elaborate this view of poetry, which, however faulty, was at least an improvement on the old idea of imitation, and to infer from it that poetry and the fine arts generally are not mere inexpressive copies of the external world but, like the world itself, a revelation of eternal essences, was a step which, after this, could not be long delayed. In its bearing on psychology, the inference was drawn by Philostratus, who pointed out that not aigncte but aavmraaia is the parent-faculty of the fine arts.3 His formulation of a truth so obvious to modern minds gave the death- stroke to a psychological account of art which Plato had viewed with deep suspicion, but which had so far held its ground thanks to the support of Aristotle.4 It was reserved for Plotinus to make the necessary metaphysical adjustment. Yet when his friend Amelius desired to have a portrait of the master painted herefused, saying : " Is it not enough to carry about this image in which nature has enclosed us ? Must I also consent to leave, as a desirable spectacle for posterity, a more lasting image of the image ?'"6 The objection proves his loyalty to Plato, even though it betrays an imperfect understanding of Plato's argument in the tenth book of the Republic. But by 263, when Porphyry came to Rome, Plotinus had gained a clearer insight into the nature of art, for soon afterwards he enthusiastically praised a symbolic poem on the Sacred Marriage between Zeus and the Eternal Wisdom which Porphyry had composed for the festival of Plato's birthday,6 and presently wrote his own tractate On Intelligible Beauty, in which his former notion that art can produce no more than e6o8woXov E3WXov is finally abandoned. This revolution in his ideas may have been due solely to his own reflection and a closer study of the Platonic text, but there are grounds for believing that it was at least helped forward by external influences, and particularly by that of his fellow-Platonist, the pagan Origen, who like his Christian namesake and Plotinus himself had been a pupil of Ammonius Saccas. For this lesser Origen Plotinus had a deep respect,' and Longinus, in a passage which Porphyry reproduces in extenso, speaks of him as one of the profoundest intellects of the time.8 His preoccupation with poetic problems is well attested, for Proclus gives us an amusing record of the excitement with which on one occasion he debated with Longinus on Plato's attitude towards Homeric poetry: rpc&amp;v obcov ?rjep&amp;v tareXk,at r v 'SpLvyY /ojvnra sai ~pvpc&amp;~zrra ical b~plire 'roXX~ KaTEX6,J~EPO, /LecyXrlv ewvat X~lyovra 'r;)v v7'roIOeotv 1 Eusebius, H.E.

The treatise 7epti 7rwv 8atLvowv was an earlier work. Now Plotinus began writing in 253, and by the time of Porphyry's advent in 263 had written twenty-one treatises. His tractate On Intelligible Beauty was com- posed after this, during the five years of Porphyry's stay in Rome; and the debate between Origen and Longinus, at which Porphyry was present, must have occurred at the same period. Amelius had been a member of the circle since 246. A comparison of these dates makes it probable that the incident of the portrait took place at some point anterior to Porphyry's arrival, and that it was Origen who, by his oral discussions of poetic problems and by his written thesis, helped Plotinus to reach the modified conception of art which is formulated in the famous tractate. The absence of documentary proof leaves this a matter of conjecture: but whether or no the conjecture is well founded, it is indisputable that the imitative theory which made art a mere reduplication of the perceptible world was already dead when Plotinus began writing. Its rejection had been implicit in the symbology worked out before his time by several generations of eclectic thinkers; and Plotinus, in abandoning it once for all, was but completing their task. H.
