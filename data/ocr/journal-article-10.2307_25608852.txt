The Last Judgment (fig. 1) is situated to the right of the choir in the oratory, where the priest celebrates mass.1 The width of the panel is double its height, emphasizing horizontal ity. In the center of a radiant nimbus, composed of many seraphim, God in glory appears. Mary on the right and John the Baptist on the left are figures of intercession; they are surrounded by apostles, patriarchs, martyrs, Saint Dominique, and Saint Francis of Assisi. The virgin wears the garb of the Camaldolese order in reference to the founder of the order, the hermit Romuald de Camaldoli. Below this divine vision is a representation of the world of the resurrected: The blessed are separated from the damned by two rows of open, empty graves, which guide the glance in a perspectival regression directed towards an open space, while dividing the composition into two parts. This vast field of black graves, made of white paving stone and situated under the Judge, was a pictorial invention of Fra Angelico. In addition, there is an empty sarcophagus, which could be that of Christ, the first one who was resurrected. Just below God, an angel carries the Cross and the trumpets of two other angels announce the end of time. Both the upper and the lower parts of the panel are symbolically divided into hell on the right and paradise on the left. The blessed are taken by the circle of angels into a paradise-like garden towards the narrow door of eternal life. The clear and luminous disposition of the angel accompanying them reminds us of Saint Augustine's text on the Trinity, which concerns the embodiment of the faith in the angels. It is opposed to the chaos of the dead, pulled by the devils towards hell, located in a closed, dark cave inside a mountain with 270 nude sinners. The sphere of earth and heaven circumscribes a hollow space: a sky that looks like a pair of wings.2 This spatial dynamic acquires the shape of the dove of the Holy Spirit, which symbolizes the human ascent towards the divine; it is accentuated by three lobes on the top of the panel. For Albertus Magnus, the artistic and theological representation of such a locale possesses a virtus factiva (ars) and operativa (locus igitur ad esse operantur).3 The Last Judgment of Fra Angelico contains several stylistic features that were to emerge as typical during Florentine Quattrocento. The path of the open graves composes a vertical perspective leading toward a heavenly opening; this movement is accentuated by the horizontality of the panel. An element of the pictorial narrative contains a figure of mystery, which is similar to a vision of the Holy Spirit symbolizing the passage between heaven and earth, father and son, divine and human. The subject of the Last Judgment is precisely that of intercession. Jesus said: "Again, I tell you that if any two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in Heaven. For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them" (Matthew 18:19-20). The salvation of the soul was the explicit goal of the religious life of the Dominican friars. This painting no longer belongs to the logic of the ground sheltering a figure or a figure standing out against a background. According to Albertus Magnus, by its dynamis the sky produces a sign, a signa translata. Through the act of contemplation, the actual representation of the sky is transformed into an otherworldliness, redeeming the soul of the faithful. With the signing of the contracts, Ambrogio Traversari established the church Santa Maria degli Angeli as a meeting place of the sacred, civil, and artistic. The Abbot General of the Camaldolese order possessed a magnificent library of Greek works and was one of the rare monks of his time to have learned Hebrew. As a humanist, he renewed the dialogue between the Western and Eastern churches that had indeed split in 1054 on 1. Diane Cole Ahl, Fra Angelico (Paris: Edition PhaTdon, 2008), pp. 75-78. 2.

The Oriental world refused the concept of the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son (ex Patre Filioque procediti). It is during the Council of Florence, in 1439, that the Eastern church, worried about the Turkish threat, accepted the Roman doctrine of filioque. Fra Angel ico's painting is characterized by a two sided approach: first, the introduction of the totalizing scene of the Last Judgment and then of a specific sign, that of the sky, suggesting the vision of the Holy Spirit and symbolizing the promise of resurrection. The double figure of the heavenly landscape transformed into the Holy Spirit is a testimony to the religious and political concerns of Fra Angelico, the Camaldolese monks, and their Abbot General AmbrogioTraversari.4 Metamorphosis of a head The work titled Anthropomorphic landscape attributed to Matthaus Merian the Elder (1593-1650) is also an image of transformation, but reveals, on the contrary, a tellurian universe (fig. 2). A hilly landscape contains corpses, meadows, a source of water, and a forest, which becomes a reposed face when we tilt our head. The spring turns into the eye; the house with the two doors into the nose, the leaves of the trees into the beard, the mill into the ear. The head-landscape disperses into independent motifs. At a close range, a world of tiny characters emerges, introducing narrative scenes and treading new paths on the face of this giant, whom they do not know and who, in turn, is oblivious to their existence. They transform the earth into a ploughed and cultivated place. It is this change of scale that fires up our imagination. With this picture, the artist created a prototype that enjoyed a wide distribution thanks to its engraving in the book Ars Magna lucis and umbrae by Father Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680)5 which served as a reference for the scholars of that time. The miracles of relics gave way to the magical power of nature, testifying to its celestial design. At the same time, there is a displacement of the identification of God, who is no longer the Imago Dei but a device with the help of which the signs of the world are conveyed to us. This metamorphosis of a head focuses upon the idea of man as a composite body interacting with the universe. Based on the concept of microcosm and macrocosm, the human representation of the universe is tied to the body: Man, in Antiquity, was termed a lesser world (a microcosm) and the term does appear appropriate, since man is composed of water, earth, air and fire, his body is thus an analogue of the world for, just as man has bones, the armature of his flesh, the world has the rocks; just as man 4. A combination of political and religious themes can also be detected in Piero della Francesca's The Baptism of Christ (ca. 1448 1450). On a similar use of the shape of the dove in the work of Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca, see Carlo Ginzburg, Enquete sur Piero della Francesca (Paris: Flammarion, 1983), p. 32. 5.

The cosmic body is made from the ultimate raw material consisting of the "likenesses" of certain elemental physical forms; these common structures are bringing humans into life. However, a later version of this anthropomorphic landscape, presented in an engraving by Claude Frangois Fortier (1775-1835), announces a radical change (fig. 3). Here, the head becomes a ruin, personifying time. The inscription underneath reads: "Time, which destroys everything, gives existence to everything: I come from the debris which you see." It is a landscape of a soul, projecting the affect of man into nature. A face turning into a landscape reminds us literally of Golgotha, the mountain where Adam's skull is buried. In Hebrew, "Adam" means the creature made out of clay. The fall of Adam separated man from primordial nature, and established his dissemblance from God, signifying the definitive break from unadulterated nature. In the Origin of German Tragic Drama, Walter Benjamin defined allegory as a petrified primitive landscape. According to him, history and memory are the filters of any allegoric reading: "History, in what it always had of untimely, painful, of imperfect, marked in a face?no: in a skull."7 Wasted bodies In Dirty White Trash (with Gulls), a work by Tim Noble and Sue Webster, the artists' combined silhouette is projected on a wall (fig. 4). At a closer look, the viewer discovers that the projected silhouette is formed by a heap of rubbish. The first personal exhibition of these artists took place in London in 1996 and was entitled "British Rubbish." Their self-portrait?a shadow of debris projected on a wall?became their signature, indicating 6. Quoted in Martin Kemp, Leonardo da Vinci, The Marvellous Works of Nature and Man (London: J. M.

A human silhouette, after all, is a result of an assembly of inanimate waste, of trash. In the strategy of anti-art, modern sculpture becomes a cognitive experiment, oscillating between the illusion of a figure and a simple assembly of junk. The magic is summarized in the black humor of a heap of waste whose projection is transformed into bodies, questioning the bond between the waste bin and the human. Humans are no longer part of the four or five elements of the universe, but are represented by their own waste.</page><page sequence="5">328 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 Figure 4.

Noble and Webster's piece recalls the premonitory words of Marx: "In the future, man will create objects designed to be wasted/' In the process of externalization of knowledge, human artifacts devalue man to the point where tools and objects create a dependence that overwhelms him. He finds himself split up from the cosmic dimension of being in the world by the overproduction of his own waste. Junk Series: Narcissus, after Caravaggio by Vik Muniz is an artwork created with elements of waste (fig. 5). It is a collective work made with young people living in the ghettoes of Rio de Janeiro. In a space the size of a basketball court, they collected discarded objects, scraps, tires, and bottles, and arranged them in such a way that, from a certain point of view, the image of Caravaggio's Narcissus appears. The artists of the Italian Renaissance represented Narcissus?this metaphor for beauty?within sublime landscapes, at edges of rivers. Leon Battista Alberti referred to Narcissus when he said: "What else can you call painting but a similar embracing with art of what is presented on the surface of the water in the fountain?"8 Vik Muniz's Narcissus of the twenty-first century, in contrast, shows the cleavage between the ideal of a myth and its projection created by human waste. 8.

The photographer Shomei Tomatsu offers an even more unexpected vision in his Nagasaki series: an indescribable thing that seems to be a marine mammal or amorphous flesh (fig. 6). It is, in fact, a bottle of beer melted in the incandescence of the explosion of an atomic bomb. Tomatsu's work reveals the horror of atomic weaponry. This double image shows the human transformation operated on an artifact, which becomes a mutant body, predicting the destiny of the living, their objects, and their environment in case of atomic war. This historical juxtaposition of works bears on the placement of a body within space or next to an object, as an arena of transformation. The doubled image is governed by a chiasm of the figure becoming space. The celestial vision of Fra Angelico is an image of the sky doubled by its appearance as the Holy Spirit, a symbol of transcendence. The anthropomorphic landscape of Matthaus Merian the Elder belongs to the logic of embodied correspondence between man-microcosm and the world-macrocosm, which accords with a materialist vision of humankind leaning towards an aesthetic of ruins, symbolized by the skull-landscape. This split of humans from their environment reveals the embrace of the object rather than of nature. Tim Noble and Sue Webster created a human silhouette constituted by garbage. Shomei Tomatsu completed the circle by showcasing man's transformation of artifacts into mutant flesh.</page></plain_text>
