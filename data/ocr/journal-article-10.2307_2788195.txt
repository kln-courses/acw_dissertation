Thomas, M.A. Among the many problems suggested by the works of Spencer and Gillen, and particularly by the Northern Tribes, is that of the relation between the anthropomorphic [49]</page><page sequence="2">No. 28.] MAN. [1905. myths and mounds of the Eastern tribes and the animal myths and mounds of the Central tribes. Each group was or is in the habit of preparing for the initiation ceremonies a piece of ground on which the sacred beings were depicted, together with seenies from their mythical hIistory, by mournds of etarth. Among the tribes of the south-east the custom is recorded by Eyre,* and earlier still somne important facts were recorded of the ceremonies of the Wellington district by Henderson.t He relates that "Piame," who is said to lhave caused a flood long ago, and is expected to cause another in the future4 was represented by a recumbent figure, and that the eyrie of the eagle-hawk, under which guise they figured the evil spirit Mudjegong,? was also represented. The story was that Piame had malny children. but all save two were destroyed by the eagle-hawk. Among the Urabunna the Wilyaru ceremony commemorates the victory of the bell-bird, Oreoica cristatall (the name is also given to Myzantha mnelanophkrys), over the eagle-hawk, who was formerly a cannibal and destroyed many of mankind. Although the two myths are not identical they are, it is clear, closely connected, and the question arises, is Baiame a sublimated bell-bird, or is the bell-bird a decayed Baiame ? These myths of combats between eagle-hawk anid crow or other animals are common all over the south and east of the continent,?[ and on the whole it seems probable that the Baiame element is secondary. Has Baiame, then, developed out of oine of these combative crows, or has he replaced one ? So far as we can judge, the relation between Punjdel and the eagle-hawk seems to be close, and it is difficult in hiis case to suppose that the myth has been transformed, because, unlike the Baiame myth quoted above, the animal adversary htas not put on human form. The question is inot one that can be readily solved, and I will not attempt to solve it here. It may be nioted that the evidence of Henderson, who wrote in 1829 or 1830, completely throws light on Dr. Tylor's theory** that Baiame was a creation of the missionaries between 1830 and 1840. Here we see him figuring as a great magician, indeed, rather than a " high god," in the initiation rites of tribes absolutely untouched at the time, so far as I know, by missionary infltuenice. In 1837 Macarthur writes,tt that they have a general idea of a creator, hiimself uncreated, and dance in February and March in honour of Baiame. An ounce of positive being more valuable than a ton of negative evidence, we might allow the testimony of these two witnesses to outweigh the nuimerouis early denials of the existence of an aboriginal god. But they do not by, any means stand alone. In addition to Hendeison and Macarthur we have the reports of the first missionaries. The Wellington Mission was opened early in October, 1832,44 some six months after the missionaries reached New South Wales. A year or so after their arrival at Wellington they record?? that the blacks had two or three names for the devil but none for God; their expectation of a flood in the future is also recorded.IIII Baiame is sail to live over the waterlT[ and to have made them all, but this was denied earlier"'1 ; and they see him in dreams anid pray to him (?). The Rev. I. Taylor reports in 1839ttt that they believe in three gods-one of whom made all things, another is his son, and the third tells them when to corroboree, appoints their ceremonies, and teaches them their sacred songs. There seems, however, to be some confusion lhere. In a MS. vocabuilary of the Wirradhuri language as spoken in the Wellington district of New South Wales, Archdeacon Gunther makes some remarks on the subject * II., 236. t Observations on the Colonies of N.

[No. 28. of Baiame.* The hook is dated 1839 and containis somiie 2,500 words; it must, there- fore, have taken some conisiderable time to collect. Archldeaconi Gunthler had had, therefore, opportunities for learning details of the belief in Baiame and was probabl,y the source of Hale's information. Of Baiame lie writes " There is no doubt in my mind that the name Baiamai refers t-o the Supreme Being, and the ideas entertainted by some of the more thoughtful aborigines coucerning, Him are a remnant of original traditions prevalent among the ancients abouit the Deity. Baiamai was described to me by one of the most intelligenit and thoughtful of the abori- gines in the following terms, to give his own simple expressions in Ernglish thus "(1.) He lives a great way off from this earth towards sunrising. "(2.) He has always been sitting down (or living) there, long, lonlg time ago. He never dies. (3 ) He can dlo wlat lhe likes: when he wants or says anytlhing, it must be done ; if he wants to eat bread or fish, they must come to hlim. (4.) Ile is very good, he hulrts nobody ; lie likes the blavks who are good. "There is also an idea entertained by the more thoughtful that good natives will go to Baiamai when they die.t Nor muist I omit to mention that there has been from time to time, i.e., every three or four years, a ecurious ceremony performed amon,g the blacks. several tribes beinig assembled, which appeared to be a reninant of some religious rites. A song was senit for the occasion by Baiamaai or his son, which was sung by those a3sembled; a solemn procession took place, certain mysterious figures painted on pieces of bark of men and other objects were displayed at the time. "To obtain all the partictilars of this ceremony was impossible, as it was to be kept a secret among the aborigines. My informant, as far as he ventured to tell me anything about it, charged mne not to mention it to anybody. "tI would further add that tlhe idea of a futuire state is not quite extinct among them, although some of them speak like infidels and will hear of no hereafter . . He tlhinks the idea of transmigration is of white origin.4 Eyre? mentions (1845) the belief in Biam on the Murruimbidgee and Biam-baitchly -on the Murray. He is saidl to be like a black but deformed ; his deformnity results from hIis sitting cross-lerged in his canoe. Trhe only othler reference before the time of Ridleyll occutrs in a report (1852) of tlie Moravian Missions at Lake Boga ?5 " Sometimes instead of answering they showed uIs figuires cut ouit of baLrk which they called natta,** possibly a kind of idol or picture ' of the devil . . . The good spirit they call pei a mei." On a later pagett we reld, "They have somie idea of a higher being . . . Peiamei, they say, lives up above and their magicians taught them that hie lhad created all tlhilngs ; they have to placate him by dances . . . They name him also Malhrnamn-mu-rok, which seems i to mean 'father of all' (niabauk =-father)." This is probably the same name as that given by Howitt for the Wotjoballuk in thie form Mami-ngorak.4t Dr. Howitt reproduces?? witlhout comnment a statement of Manning's that missiol- aries did not uintil many years after 1834 land at Sydney on their way to Moreton Bay and never came to the southern districts (of N S. Wales ?) at any time. This * llowitt, AiVtire Tribes, p. 502, mentions that this exists; he was, however, uinable to find it. (f. U. S. PAxpl. Exp., At Itkit , p. 110. t C,f. N. S. W.

[1905. is entirely erroneous.* Missionaries from the Pacific were at Port Jackson for a short time forty years earlier (1798-1801), and Marsden remained and established hiis mission at Paramatta in 1816. Threlkeld worked at Newcastle in 1825-6 and at Lake Macquarie in 1826-7, and again from, I believe, 1832 till 1841. There was a iiative institution at Sydney from 1828 till 1841, at least; the Wellington Mission lasted from 1832 till 1843; the German mission at Moretun Bay was established in 1836. The Moravialns went to Australia, I believe, in 1838, and there was certainly a Wesleyan nmission at Merri Creek, near Melbourne, for some years, from 1836 onwards. Possibly there were others whlo have escaped my notice. Mr. Manning's assertiont is thuis utterly wide of the mark. It does not, however, follow that the beliefs of the wild natives were markedly or even at all affected by the work of these missionaries. On the other hand, it seems certain that if Mr. ManUing did not himself distort the beliefs of the natives with whom he came in conltact in 1844-5, le muist have taken his facts from those who had beeni uinder Christiall influence. From the uncritical character of Mr. Manning's statements we may infer that the former is more probable. However this may be, it is evident that Dr. Tylor's theory of the missionary origin of Baiame between 1830 and 1840 is entirely uintenable, and verv stronig evidence wotuld be necessary to establish eveni a prima' facie case for a non-native origin of a being, who, in the earliest reports, bears such obviously native characteristics, and is in nlo way contaminated by Christian elements. The menitioni of Mudjegong as a being who is present at the bora suggests that he is in reality nlot an evil spirit, but the counterpart of Daramultun. Dr. Howitt has even maintained the same view of Koin. Tt would, however, take ine too far to discuss this here. One point may, perhaps, be mentioned in conelusion. Good or evil beings-Bunijil, Mudjegonig, Muillion, &amp;c.-either bear the name of ihe evil hawk or are elosely associated with it; one of the naimes of the phratries in the tribes in questioni is frequently the same as one of these names. It may be no more than a coincidence, but the name of the Urabunna ceremony is Wilyarni, alnd welu or wilyaru is the name of a bird-the curlew-from Port Lincoln to some distance north of the Arunta. The Nauo tell a story" of how a mani who nearly destroyed them was turned into a welu. Can we infer from this that the bell-bird in the Urabunna myths is the culrlew of other tribes, or that they have substituted the bell-bird for the curlew ? Whether this is so or not, it is interesting to note that welu and cognate forms seem to be the root of the phratry name of several eight-clan tribes? ; the Waagai, Walpari, and Warramuinga have Ulunru the Bingongnia, Wiliukull . the Umbaia, Gnanji, and Tjingilli, the mQre remote form Illitchi or W'illitchi. But this is no more than a conjecture. N. W. THOMAS. * See T)ans. Lond. Aiss. Soe., IV.) 455, &amp;c.; Symons' Life of Draper; Backhouse's Letters, &amp;C. t Journ. Boy. Soe., N. S. Wales, 1882.
