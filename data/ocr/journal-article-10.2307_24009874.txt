A journey is a physical displacement that involves doing, viewing and thinking, the most fundamental human activities. Al andar se hace camino y al volver la vista atrâs se ve la senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar.2 Making a journey, looking at the path, returning home, and, eventually, talking or writing about it are the gnoseological operations that are at the foundation of travel narrative. The journey is not just a sequence of footsteps never to be imprinted again, but an object for the traveler's reflection. And writing one's journey it is just an attempt to re-create what one cannot regain, as in the well known line by Yeats: "I sing what was lost," echoed by another famous line by Machado: "Yo canto lo que se pierde." Almost half a century ago, Louis Marin stated that "le récit est un piège,"3 acknowledging the intrinsic impossibility of attaining objectivity in any narrative of human events. It is a fact that, as soon as writers sit, pen in hand, in front of a blank page, the infinite possibilities of journeys the blank page offers 1.

As Marguerite de Navarre had emphasized four centuries before, most writings done by "gens de lettres" tend to favor "la beaulté de la rhethorique," befuddling "la vérité de l'histoire" (Heptaméron, Prologue). The elemental struggle of creative writing and the need to create a "narration héroïsante" (as Réal Ouellet called it) have led writers to reshape the world in a totally personal manner. Should one then look at other modes of description as more intrinsically objective than writing? Could drawings, photographs, and maps be better examples of objectivity? The story of geographical displacements has been told through the ages in spoken and written words, alphabetical signs and sounds, conventions and signifiers that translate the experience of a physical reality for listeners and read ers alike. Translating (from Latin, transferred implies transposing something (words, ideas, images) from somewhere into somewhere else, not just moving sentences from one language into another, but also physical realities into verbal utterances, as in Octavio Paz's expression: "aprender a hablar es aprender a traducir."5 This statement, naturally, covers any kind of utterance, from children's cries of surprise to explorers' attempts to explain the surrounding world to an audience which has never left home. A visitor from a far-away place, ignorant of the local language, needs the help of an interpreter to decipher sites, translate conversations, lead through labyrinthine situations. This intermediary, cicerone or dragoman, an ambiguous character in travel narrative, hated by the locals and suspicious to the traveler, is an essential facilitator who transfers notions and ideas from one culture to another. And travelers who return home become translators of some sort, mediators of a distant world for their listeners. Physical entities can thus be transferred into the realm of spoken or written words or shaped into images and maps. Like words in traditional narrative, the language of cartography follows the classical definition "aliquid stat pro aliquo." As the drawing an object indicates the concrete objectitself, mapping a geographical entity implies that cartographers and readers have agreed to accept a complex set of conventions. The result underscores a specific relationship of an image with reality and will be subjected to the historical context that has produced it, its author's idiosyncrasies, prejudices, lies, and political agenda. 4. In Romance languages, however, verbs like tradurre, traduire, traducir come from trans-ducere, that indicates the activity of conveying something across a body of water, and thus, metaphorically, from one language to another or from a reality to its verbal or graphic representation.. Etymologically, a metaphor (from the, Greek metaphord) is also a form of transferring a descriptive term from one object to another, different but analogous. 5. Octavio Paz.

Fig. 1. A detail of Sabaudiae Ducatus by Jean de Boens (1617) In some old maps, however, conventional symbols coexisted with visual images, as in this map of the well-traveled road from France to Italy through the mountains of Savoy between Chambéry and Turin. [Fig. 1] The main road of the Val di Susa follows the Dora Riparia from Bussoleno to Avigliana {Villane), but a parallel valley is also shown, from Coazza to Trana, along with the sketches of the mountain ridges of Rocciamelone and Colle La Russa. While a cross distinguishes market towns from simple hamlets, the town of Avigliana is indicated here by a picture of its church and palaces; the cartographer was more interested in the visual impact of his images than the correct scale of his map. As transformations that aim at retaining many of the formal features of the original 6. Speaking on the strategic importance of visual observation and maps, Machiavelli suggested that the ruler should learn the basic notions of geographic strategy: " [...] e parte imparare la natura de' siti e conoscere come surgono e monti, come imboccono le valle, come iacciono e piani, ed intendere la natura de' fiumi e de' paduli; e in questa porre grandissima cura" (Principe, XIV). 7. Returning to France after exploring the Mississippi Valley, Robert Cavelier de la Salle reported that this river emptied into the Gulf of Mexico near Matagorda Bay (now in Texas), "almost certainly falsifying its location to place it nearer the gold and silver of the Spanish colonies in order to increase the king's interest in colonizing that area" (Vaughn L. Glasgow, ed., in The sun King: Louis XIV and the New World. New Orleans, LA: The Louisiana Museum Foundation, 1984: 318). Soon cartographers engraved maps based on La Salle's account.</page><page sequence="5">412 Luigi Monga messages, translations cannot avoid losses and distortions, for all lexical and phonetic elements peculiar to the source may not be recreated in the target language. And, as far as pictures are concerned, rendering reality into images means constraining a three-dimensional reality into a two-dimensional image. Fig. 2. "Das verfluchte 2£weite Kussen" (Goethe in Rome) More dramatically, any attempt to transfer and reducing a vast area of the globe onto a flat sheet cannot retain the curved status of the original. There fore, distorted representations are normal in cartography. From Herodotus ("ópsis," sight) to Filippo Sassetti ("vedere, toccare e scrivere") to contemporary travelers and photographers, the most imme diate experience of travel is a visual one. Eyesight, the most privileged of the human senses, was at the foundation of the Baconian and Galileian révolu tìons, superseding even verbal interaction, particularly when travelers to far-away regions were ignorant of local languages. Explorers of new worlds were fond of including engravings of native people and wild animals in their maps or - narratives8 to complement their verbal descriptions, since any comprehension of the whole experience of a vastly different "otherness" is just a synecdochic impression that does only partial justice to reality. The value of visual support to travelers was never so great as in the age of the Grand Tour, when foreign visitors to Italy admired her monuments, purchased valuable artwork, and had their portraits taken by local painters. Panini,9 Piranesi, Bellotto, Canaletto, and 8. Artists and scientists joined 18th-century expeditions to far away lands: Commerson embarked with Bougainville, Parkinson and Buchan with Captain Cook. Their function was to observe and record with graphic impartiality what would have been difficult to express verbally: flora, fauna, human customs. And painters documented the 1828 Champollion Rosellini scientific mission to Egypt with a wealth of color drawings of hieroglyphs and frescoes as today's photographers routinely do for all geographic expeditions. 9. Giovanni Paolo Panini (1691-1765) produced numerous Roman "capricci," combining in his landscapes disparate monuments in imaginary compositions. They were sold to Grand Tour travelers and provided them with lasting mementos of their visit.

Goethe, one of the most sensi tive visitors to the Peninsula and also an accomplished draftsman, was es corted on his jour ney (1786-1787) by a number of artists who drew sketches of his favorite sites. His vision of Italy is conveyed to us, stereoscopically, through his words and more than 3,000 drawings10 Fig. 3. The same woodcut in Schedel's Liber cronicarum (1493) illustrated England and France that reveal his sharp power of observing (what Luigi Magnani calls "la disciplina del saper vedere," in Femmel 16). There is a puzzling pen and ink drawing of Goethe, probably by Tischbein, showing the poet in his Roman apartment, arranging the pillows on his bed, muttering to himself "Das verfluchte zweite Kiissen" ("This damned second pillow"!) under the watchful eye of his cat and the reproductions of some Roman statues [Fig. 2]. The German words, coming out of the poet's mouth just as in a modem cartoon, imply something that is we do not know from Goethe's journal. Peering at Goethe in his bedroom, wearing a dressing gown and fluffing his extra pillow in frustration, we wonder about new facets of Goethe's Roman experience. Sometimes, however, a sketch is just an idealized image, without any realistic input, as in this fifteenth-century woodcut of a city [Fig. 3]; its author, Hartman Schedel, used it in the Latin version of the Liber cronicarum (Nuremberg Chronicle) under the caption "Angliae Provincia" 10. Goethe's albums of sketches and the drawings by his friends, Tischbein and Kniep, are indispensable companions to his Italienische Reise. See Gerhard Femmel's Begleittext undKatalog %um Reprint von Goethes Reise-, Zerstreuungs- und Trostbiichlein (Leipzig: Insel, 1985), 2 vol., and Wolfgang von Oettingen's Goethe und Tischbein (Weimar: Goethe Gesellschaft, 1910), the source of Fig. 2; see also Disegni di Goethe in Italia, a cura di G. Femmel, intr. di L. Magnani (Vicenza: Neri Pozza, 1977). Among dozens of foreign artists who visited Italy, Edward Lear (1812 1888), the English nonsense poet, produced splendid lithographs for his Illustrated Journals of a Landscape Painter in Southern Calabria (London: Bendey, 1852), completing and documenting the narrative of his travels through southern Italy.</page><page sequence="7">414 Luigi Monga and in the German edition as "Frankreich.'' The image of a road as a geographic element that joins cities is closely tied Fig. 4. The road from London to Dover (left) and from Calais to Beauvais (right) in Matthew Paris's Itinerary (ca. 1525) to the accounts of a journey and brings about a graphic conceptu alization of an individual's experi ence of time and space. [Fig. 4] The stretch of the road from London to Dover and from Calais to Beauvais, with landmarks, topo nyms, and daily stops, is both a description of a journey and a guide for travelers. Another striking example of this function is a sixth-century road atlas featur ing distances between cities as well as overnight accommodations. We know it from a thirteenth century copy that was once owned by Konrad Peutinger, a Renais sance German scholar (hence called "Tabula Peutingeriana") [Fig. 5]. This large stretch of parchment (6.74m by 34cm) portrays the roads from the Ibe rian Peninsula to the Far East, stretched lengthwise, focusing on towns, inns and thermal springs, and unconcerned about seas and mountain ranges. While a drawing of a stretch of road is a simple undertaking, a description of the region beyond the road requires advanced calculations and can only be produced by experienced geographers analyzing complex data. "Geographia," the bigger picture, began to be distinguished from "chorographia," the detailed representation of the space, and is intuitive in this woodcut from Peter Apian's Cosmographia [Fig. 6]. The realm of the chorographic microcosm is often enriched by details of imaginary scenes, sea monsters, and wild beasts to emphasize the dangers of a voyage or even to hide the cartographers' ignorance, as Jonathan 11. A grandiose canvas by Albrecht Altdorfer, the Rattle ofAlexander at Issos (1529, Miinchen, Alte Pinakothek), offers a rare aerial view of the Earth, evoking a geographer's perception of a large section of our planet, including the curving of the horizon.</page><page sequence="8">Mapping the Journey / Translating the World 415 Swift mockingly wrote.12 For often geographers confess their inability to fit their information on a map, "crowd[ing][...] part of the world which they do not know about, ad ding notes in the margin to the effect that beyond this lies nothing but sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproach able bogs, Scythian ice, or a frozen sea."13 A curious model of Renais sance cartography is the Isolario, an adas Fig. 5. A detail of southwestern Gaule in the Tabula Peutingeriana (from the Dictionnaire d'archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie) or islands, based on parceling the world into small entities without any effort to determining their size or locating them on the globe (Lestringant 1991,152).14 Islands are easily created by explorers and cartographers, given a self-sufficient status, viewed as enclosed in their own autonomy, allowed to take peculiar elements and to harbor Utopias and dreams. A map in Benedetto Bordone's Isolano of 1534 (fol. 70v) [Fig. 7] shows a large archipelago15 consisting of three major islands and three smaller archipelagoes, all oriented along the major winds (Maestro. Greco, Garbino, and Scirocco). Two of these islands are described as gendered (Imaugla and Inebila, inhabited, respectively, by men and women, 12. "So geographers, in Afric-maps, / With savage-pictures fill their gaps; / And o'er unhabitable downs /Place elephants for want of towns" ("On Poetry: A Rhapsody," 1: 177). 13. In John Dryden's introduction of his translation of Plutarch's Life ofTbeseus. 14. Islands are also hard to locate, apparently shifting their position on a map, easily forgotten or subject to cartographers' whims. Fra Mauro, a 15th-century Venetian mapmaker, giving up all efforts of drawing some newly-found islands in his mappamondo, wrote on it, in the general area of the sea southeast of China: "In questo mar oriental sono molte insule grande e famose, le quali non ho posto, per non haver loco"; he repeated the same admission in the area of the Chinese Sea: "In questo mar sono molte insule, le quali non met[t]o, per non haver loco " (Placido Zurla, Il mappamondo di Fra Mauro. Venezia, 1806: 38). 15. The enormous distances between some of these groups of islands (820 miles from Inebila to Maniole, 400 miles from Maniole to Bazacata) show that Bordone has fitted in one drawing a host of disparate islands that would be improper to gather in one archipelago. Bordone's knowledge of these entities and their location appears very sketchy.</page><page sequence="9">416 LuigiMonga a common topos in Renaissance cartography16); in two of the other islands ("isole di satyri") men are said to be born with a tail; there is even an archipelago of nine small rocks made of lodestone (Maniole)17 that attract ferrous material from passing ships, pulling out their nails and shipwrecking them; finally, the only Gtogr.sphid. Bins fimilitiiclo. Cboragraphia. Binsfbnilitudo. Fig. 6. From Petrus Apianus's Cosmograpkia (1524) plausible island in this anonymous archipelago, Bazacata, has no peculiar properties other than the best pearls in the world. It is obvious that the infor mation trickling down from the explorers to the cartographers could not be judged independendy, and legendary, plausible, and real islands were juxta posed with no effort to determine their location. By crumbling away the globe into small entities, the \solario avoided also the vexata quaestio of establish ing their exact location in the ocean, for in early modern cartography, islands were perceived as mysterious sites that were not easily accessible and could be reached only by sheer chance. In fact, until the middle of the eighteenth century, when accurate longitudinal coordinates were established, navigators would just "happen" onto islands.18 And, once they sailed away, it was practically impossible 16. See, infra, the discussion on the island of the Amazones, thought to be located near the island of California, according to the early Renaissance tendency to accumulate peculiar elements ("singularités," as French cartographers called them) marking the geographical mythology of distant lands. 17. A 15th-century map (British Library, Harley MS 7182) sets this archipelago (Maniolae insulae antropofagorum) in the Arabian Sea (Pe/agus Indiens), combining cannibals and lodestones, while it puts the Satyrorum insulae in the Bay of Bengal (Whitfield 12-13). Lestringant (1991, 121 124)discusses the description of this archipelago in André Thevet's Cosmographie universelle. 18. This "island syndrome" was particularly dramatic in establishing the cartography of the immense Pacific Ocean, where many islands were still vaguely located in 18th-century maps and kept moving about. A case in point is a map of 1771, in which the cartographer who described the voyage of de Bougainville around the world wrote that the position, and even the existence, of the Solomon Islands was not clear ("l'existence et la position sont douteuses,"</page><page sequence="10">Mapping the Journey / Translating the World 417 for them to return to these small dots lost in the immensity of the ocean. Antonio Pigafetta's description of Magellan's discovery of the so called "Isole infortunate" in the Pacific Ocean on January 24,1521, shows the ambiguity of Renaissance geography, since he relied on inaccurate measure ments of distances and only on latitudinal data: "due isolotte disabitate [...], lungi l'una dall'altra due cento leghe [...]; la prima sta in 15 gradi di latitudine all'australe, e l'altra in 9" (Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo, 42). The enormous distance between them could not justify calling them an archipelago, but Sebastian Munster did it anyway in his 1550 Cosmographia, putting these "Insulae infortunatae" off the coast of Peru, probably for moral symmetry with the "Insulae fortunatae," the mythical Canary Islands.19 Locating islands in the ALCVNE Lfolc a quelle per uueirro per miglia ceneo ucno,lono pollerà qua le vna ui cimagli nominante folaméte e da femine habrtata,fêza ajcbuno huo mt^Knómolto eia la fcdilongaiiicbill(uru [folicofi detta ) iltrcfi da huomini fenza femine h abiura .gli gualcaci mefe di maggio/opra l'ffola delle femine paf/ lino, cofi per mefi tre con effe (anno dimora , &amp; paflato quello tempo tot/ nano alla fua IfoIa.K quello che quelle femine parturifcono/c éfemina per loro la tengono^'èmafehio (annoio accapo de anni ere aJl'Ifola portare de glihuomi/ ni,&amp; cofi quelle [fole mai non mancano di gente.

The island of Brazil, west of Ireland (Hibernia), by Martin Waldseemiiller (1513) The well-charted waters of the Mediterranean were somewhat free of sea monsters,20 for centuries of sailing created portolani that registered only pragmatic observations collected by real mariners. They were indis pensable tools for sailors who had no tolerance for fiction or mythology, and accompanied pilots' books of the Mediterranean such as Alonso de Contreras's Derrotero universal which followed a terra terra galley route from Cabo de Sào Vicente in Portugal and the strait of Gibraltar to the Italian peninsula, Greece, Turkey, and the North-African coast to Ceuta, offer ing a medley of geographical details of harbors, fresh water supplies, and dangers of people and places. Like pilots' maps, Columbus's sketch of a stretch of the coast of Hispaniola [Fig. 9] left no room for subjective notations and unnecessary details. But accuracy, a sine qua non of cartography, was far from being an easily attainable goal. Many silences have accumulated through centuries of map making, and blank spaces of undomesticated regions were hidden by frightening animals as in Cornelius de Jode's territories of Nova Guinea [Fig. 10]. Maps have often been drawn according to mythical beliefs and political parti-pris.21 A well-known map drawn by German cartographers (Johannes Putsch, 20.

Although its location shifted to various locations, it represented a "spatial metonymy" and a "anthropomorphic metaphor" (1993,36-41) of latent fears that pervaded Renaissance seafarers even in a "safe" sea. 21.

The rape of this woman has not yet taken place, but in hindsight we know that it is impending. The European male has conquered a new world, a gendered island, and has given her a feminine name (Monga 1996, 30). The naked (i.e., primitive) continent, inhabited by tribes unable to exploit their riches in a systematic manner, appears to Europeans as a land to be taken without legal or moral questions. As sedentary travelers wrote preposterous narratives, stay-at-home cartographers drew maps, a process that Saint-Exupéry's self-centered geographer justified by emphasizing his own intellectual and social status ("le géographe est trop important pour flâner, il ne quitte pas son bureau"). The relationship between explorers and geographers is comparable to that between surgeons and medical doctors in the early modern period: practical vs. theoretical knowledge. Travel writers and travel bars insisted that their memoirs were written in the middle of the roaring elements, standing "en la chaise d'un navire, soubz la leçon des</page><page sequence="14">Mapping the Journey/ Translating the World 421 vents"24 and not in the com fort of their study.

The cartography of the New World offers us striking aberrations. Some maps reported a non-existent internal sea at the latitude of Chesapeake Bay, stretching almost to the Pacific Ocean;26 others located Marco Polo's 7448 islands just off the coast of California, but the most outrageous early modern hoax is the "island of California." Expecting to find an island they knew as California from a chivalric romance,27 sixteenth-century explorers and geographers, anticipated a rich land where Queen Calafia was said to rule over a population of fierce, man-eating Amazons, somewhere along the northwestern coast of Mexico (and close to the Earthly Paradise!).28 And it is not improbable that sixteenth-century Spanish explorers were affected by their readings. Witness an astonished Bernal Diaz del Castillo, entering the beautiful city of Mexico, remarking that desde que vimos tantas ciudades y villas pobladas en el agua, y en tierra firme otras grandes poblaciones, y aquella calzada tan derecha y por nivel cómo iba a Mexico, nos quedamos admirados y deciamos que parecia a las cosas 26. A letter by Verrazzano about his journey of discovery from Florida to Newfoundland (1523-1524) mentioned a narrow isthmus that was thought to separate the Atlantic from the sea of Cathay. Soon maps began to appear, showing a "Mare Indicum": Sebastian Miinster gave this myth his authority and as late as 1651 John Farrer's map of Virginia stated that the Pacific shore was only a ten-day hike from the Atlantic. 27. Las Strias de Esplandiân, a romance by Gard Ordonez de Montalvo about the adventures of Esplandiân, the son of Amadis of Gaul (also in Don Quijote's library), was a popular book, published in Seville in 1510. It helped to spread the the myth of California in Spain: "Sabed que a la diestra mano de las Indias, muy llegada â la parte del Paratso Terrenal, la cual fué poblada de mujeres negras, sin que algun varon entre ellas hubiese, que casi corno las amazonas era su estilo de vivir. [...] Las suas armas eran todas de oro, y tambien la guarniciones de las bestias feras en que, de las haber amansado, cabalgaban. [...] En esta isla, California llamada, habia muchos grifos, por la grande aspereza de la tierra y por las infinitas salvajinas que en ella habitaban. [...] Cualquiera varon que en la isla entrase, luego por ellas era muerto y comido"(ch. 157). This myth was so well accepted that even Columbus was convinced that his first voyage led him to the vicinity of the Earthly Paradise. A Florentine merchant, Francesco Carletti, who had been in Mexico in 1596, wrote about "il paese detto delle Californie, luoghi che sono nel continente della costiera dove è il predetto porto d'Acapulco. (...) E questa provincia abbondantissima di miniere d'oro e d'argento."(69-70). 28. A comparable situation occurred during the exploration of South America by Magellan, who named the southernmost region Patagonia, from a monster found by Primaleón, son of Palmerin de Oliva, of the homonymous romance (Salamanca, 1511), a book in Don Quixote's library, where it was found with Palmerin de Ingalaterra, translated from the Portuguese.</page><page sequence="16">Mapping the Journey / Translating the World 423 de incantésimo que cuentan en el libro de Amadis.29 So, the general practice of naming a newly-discovered land after Iberian toponyms or religious eponyms could be set aside in favor of Spanish lore. In 1535 Hernân Cortés and his conquistadores, and later on Alarcón and Coronado, surveyed Baja California, fading to determine the shape of that region. It is probable that his obsession to find Calafia's gold-laden island influenced Fray Antonio de la Ascen de incantesimo que cuentan en el libra de Amadis.29 So, the general practice of naming a newly-discovered land after Iberian toponyms or religious eponyms could be set aside in favor of Spanish lore.

At first, Hondius and Blaeu, the most reputable Dutch cartographers of the seventeenth century refused to join in the new trend, but eventually other of their confrères, including Nicolas Sanson, accepted the notion of the island of California30 [Fig. 13], rapidly promoting it, thanks to the plausibility of the technical conventions of cartography. Only at the turn of that century a Jesuit explorer of the Sonora area, Fr. Eusebio Kino, brought this legend to an end, and finally, in 1722, Guillaume Delisle drew a better map of that area. The myth, however, proved hard to kill, and a royal edict by Ferdinand VI of Spain in 1747 forced that imaginary island to join the North-American continent, but California kept creeping into maps as an island. The last one was printed in Japan in 1865!31 In 1744Jacques Cassini, an Italian cartographer at the court of France, drew a reasonably accurate map of France using trigonometric triangulations. Imperfections, however, were inevitable, for Cassini's instalments were too rudimentary to allow for precise computation of distance and angles.32 Jorge Luis Borges proposed the perfect, albeit surrealistic, solution to this conundrum in a short story disguised as a fragment of a seventeenth-century account of a description of an imaginary land: En aquel imperio, el arte de la cartografia logró tal perfección que el mapa de una provincia ocupaba una cdudad, y el mapa del imperio toda una provincia. Con el riempo, esos mapas desmesurados no sarisfacieron y los colegios de cartógrafos levantaron un mapa del imperio, que tenia el tamano del imperio y coincidia puntualmente con él. Menos adictas al estudio de la cartografia, las generaciones siguentes entendieron que ese dilatado mapa era inutil y no sin empiedad lo relegaron a la inclemencia del sol y de los inviemos. En los desiertos del Oeste perduran despedazadas ruinas del mapa, habitadas por animales y por mendigos; en todo el pais non hay otta reliquia de las disciplinas 30. Among the best known among them: Antonio de Herrera (1622), Abraham Goos (1624), Henry Briggs (1625),John Speed (1626), Jan Jansson (1636), Pieter Goos (1666), Nicolas San son (1667), Nicolaas Visscher (1680), Giovanni Rossi (1687), Frederick de Wit (1688), John Senex (1711), and H. de Leth (1740). 31. R. V. Tooley, California as an Island, in Map Collectors' Circle, no. 8 (London, 1964); Glenn McLaughlin and Nancy H. Mayo mention four maps published in Japan from 1796 to 1865 in which California is portrayed as an island (The Mapping of California as an Island. Saratoga: The California Map Society, 1995; Occasional Paper, no. 5:105-106). 32. Cassini's map of France showed a much smaller territory than what it was believed to be, prompting Louis XV to complain that his geographer had caused him to lose more territory than a failed military campaign.</page><page sequence="18">Mapping the Journey / Translating the World 425 geogrâficas.3 Borges's solution, however, reversed "the operative order of cartographic semiosis" (Klein 79) by implying that the best map is the most detailed one; he also exploded the fundamental referentiality of the map and its mimetic relationship with reality. Tongue in cheek, he set the remains of that "useless" and oversized map in a vague no man's land, avoiding any explanation of how it could have been moved there! This solution would mean the end of geography as a theoretical discipline, now reduced to a Utopian device. Never one to let a good hunch go to waste, Umberto Eco playfully commented on Borges's text in an essay "Dell'impossibilità di costruire la carta dell'Impero lai ,"34 humorously outlining some of the "difficoltà pratiche e paradossi insormontabili" involved in making this "strumento semiotico, capace cioè di significare l'impero o permettere riferimenti all'impero specie in quei casi in cui l'impero non sia altrimenti percepibile." An impossible task, indeed, for this map would have to record also the presence and movements of people, including the occasional user of the map! While postmodern critics of travel narrative have emphasized the hopelessness of dealing objectively with the description of facts, the accuracy of maps has improved dramatically with satellite photography and mapping processes obtained by automated technology that scans electronically the Earth's surface and converts it into visible images that record it with a degree of accuracy almost unthinkable a few decades ago. The new Space Oblique Mercator Projection (SOMP) based on a series of complex equations offers a more accurate cartography of the globe.35 Microwave and infrared photographs that measure variations in spectral reflectance instead of the patterns of light of traditional pictures help us understand what is underground, with specific applications in archeology and geology, crop management and land conservation, analysis of continental drift and fault movements, monitoring of human pollution, global changes, and urban development, plus the usually secret array of intelligence gathering tools. Multilens cameras that can simultaneously photograph one section of the earth vertically 33. "El rigor en la ciencia," El hactdor (1960) in Obras complétas (Barcelona: Emecé, 1989), 2: 225; the text had appeared in Borges's Historia universa! de la infamia (1954). To transpose this concept into visual narrative, one could postulate a recording of a journey in which each day is documented by a 24-hour long video tape! 34. Il secondo diario minimo (Milan: Bompiani, 1992): 157-163. 35. For a recent example of modern mapmaking of the highest caliber, see in the National Geographic (flay 2003) adigitalized map of Mount Everest, created from millions of data points collected by an aerial photography expedition. Offering enhanced shaded relief and elevation contours, it is the most detailed representation ever produced of the planet's highest mountain.</page><page sequence="19">426 Luigi Monga and an oblique one allow stereoscopic renditions of three-dimensional images in high resolution. Carrying out by proxy their exploration of the world, modern cartographers will never have to depend on lying explorers crossing high seas on fragile vessels. Earth maps have no more blank spaces left for the dreamy eyes of the children of the third-millennium, and the unknown has been removed to outer space. In fact, the latest expeditions to Mars show that we can map even areas on which human beings have not yet set foot! The major task of modern cartography involves the constant reassessing of ever-changing political borders according to the latest feuds among the denÌ2ens of this "aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci" (Parad. 22,151 ), and we all feel somewhat akin to Cervantes's cortesanos whose journeys were limited to their home library,"sin salir de sus apo sentos ni de los umbrales de la corte, mirando un mapa, sin costarle bianca, ni padecer calor ni frio, hambre ni sed" (Don Quijote, II, Vi) At the outset of our inquiry, disappointed that our analysis of contemporary travel narrative had showed it as hopelessly entangled with fiction, we had hoped that maps, drawn according to the "vera scientia" of mathematics, as Benedetto Bordone wrote in his Isolano, could reveal an objective portrait of the world. Ironically, this was the same Bordone we saw drawing fictional islands next to perfectly real ones. If the solution of our conundrum is to let machines collect and analyze objective geographic data, excluding all human interventions in this process, we must not forget that machines and robots are driven by man-made software and must be interpreted by human beings prone to errors and confusion. And, while travel narrative continues to be entangled in postmodem subjectivity, cartography appears to have a better chance to become an objective representation of the geographic reality.
