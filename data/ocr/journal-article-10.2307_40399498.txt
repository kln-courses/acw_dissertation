<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS: A PARADOX WITH SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE* JOSEPH NEEDHAM I development of modern science has led to a curious diver- gence of world-views. For the astronomers and the physicists the world is, in popular words, continually ' 'running down" to a state of dead inertness when heat has been uniformly distributed through it. For the biologists and sociologists, a part of the world (and for us a very important part), at any rate, is undergoing a pro- gressive development in which an upward trend is seen, lower states of organization being succeeded by higher states. For the ordinary man the contradiction, if such it is, is serious, because many physi- cists, in expounding the former of these principles, the second law of thermodynamics, employ the word "organization" and say it is always decreasing. Is there a real contradiction here? If so, how can it be resolved? * At the outset it must be recognized that there is no question of rejecting the second law of thermodynamics. It is the basis of all our engineering technique which gives mankind power in con- trolling natural processes. The only question is, what exactly does it mean? In the general language which scientific workers use every day we say simply that free energy, that is, energy capable of doing work, * This article is being published at a time when the author is on his way from England to Chungking on a mission of cultural and scientific cooperation for China on behalf of the British Council. He will serve at Chungking attached to the Na- tional Academy of China. 1 In thinking over these problems I have had the invaluable help and counsel of a number of friends: Professor Bernai, Dr. Clark, Dr. Danielli, Professor Dingle, Profes- sor Donnan, Sir Arthur Eddington, Dr. Guggenheim, Mr. Robin Hill, Dr. Neuberger, Professor Polanyi, Dr. Shih-Chang Shen, Dr. Waddington, and Mr. Lancelot White. Should this survey chance to fall under their eye, they will recognize points which they themselves have emphasized, but the whole responsibility for the general line and con- clusions must necessarily be borne by me. 352</page><page sequence="2">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 353 is constantly decreasing, and bound energy (entropy) is correspond- ingly increasing. This absolutely irreversible process accompanies every natural change, whether physical or chemical. In a series of linked changes, however, there may be local decreases of entropy, provided that over the whole system entropy increases. The irrever- sibility of the "degradation" of energy has been identified by Eddington 2 and many other writers with the basis of our knowledge of the one-way character of time. Only in reversed cinematograph films, but never in nature, does water flow uphill, or do the smoke and gases of an exploding bomb recompress themselves, like the djinn of fable, into the reassembling case with its explosive content. This description approaches the simple examples which are given by all elementary expositions of statistical mechanics.3 If a number of gas atoms are introduced at one corner of a room, they will in a short space of time be found equally distributed within it (assuming that their kinetic energy is great enough to overcome their mutual attractions). In other words, it is impossible for a gas in a vacuum to occupy anything less than the whole of the space available. In the same way, if "hot" molecules are introduced at one corner of the room, and "cold" molecules at another, their collisions will soon ensure that all the molecules have the same velocity and that the temperature of the room is uniformly warm. The significance of the second law of thermodynamics is, there- fore, that all particles, when left to themselves, tend to become dis- arranged with respect to one another. Now such a process is similar to the shuffling of a pack of cards, or the random distribution of a quantity of black and white balls when continuously shaken together. "Shuffling," wrote Eddington, "is the only thing nature can never undo." High probability, therefore, is associated with randomness, low probability with the opposite, whatever you like to call it- arrangement or order. Hence the definition that entropy is the sum of the logarithms of the probabilities of the "complexions" of the parts of the system. A complexion or micro-state is simply an assembly of particles having the same velocity, rotational energy, rotational axis, etc. The more complexions there are in the system the less disordered it is. The presence of many complexions having 2E. g., The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge, 1928). 3 E.g., W. C. McC. Lewis, A System of Physical Chemistry, m (London, 1919).</page><page sequence="3">354 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY very high or very low energies different from those in their vicinity is the condition under which useful work can be obtained from the system. This relatively unusual or improbable state constitutes what the physicist calls "order" or "arrangement." The corresponding "disorder" is measured by the logarithm of the probability. Thus in an isolated system the net increase of entropy implies a net decrease of order and a net increase of disorder. In such an isolated system a decrease of entropy can only occur in one part pro- vided it is over-compensated for by a simultaneous and greater in- crease of entropy in another part. The two parts must, of course, be interlinked by some sort of action, e.g., radiation. The essential physical meaning of increase of entropy is a loss of power of spon- taneous action. Two bodies at different temperatures automatically tend to come to a common temperature, but having done that they stop doing anything. It is the same with matter at different levels (subject to the law of gravity), electricity at different potentials, and so on. The tendency is always to come to a state of passivity, and whenever such a tendency takes effect, entropy increases. The "run- ning down" of the world is therefore a drift towards a state of com- plete quiescence. From the point of view of other sciences and of the human world-view in general, it is important to note exactly what words the physicist uses to describe his improbable order and his probable disorder. If we turn to the writings of the American mathematical physicist, Willard Gibbs, the first among the great founders of thermodynamics, we find that he only uses one "ordinary" word to describe high entropie states, namely "mixed-up-ness." 4 This does not occur in any of his published writings, but only as the title of a paper which he had intended to write, and which was found among a list of such titles among his papers after his death. The opposite of "mixed-up-ness" is separatedness. Later on, however, the practice grew up among physicists and astronomers to use the term "organization" for pre-entropic states. Eddington has been a protagonist of this use, as the following pas- sages from his Nature of the Physical World show: We have to appeal to the one outstanding law, the second law of ther- modynamics, to put some sense into the world. It opens up a new prov- 4 J.

When a stone falls it acquires kinetic energy, and the amount of the energy is just that which would be required to lift the stone back to its original height. By suitable arrangements, the kinetic energy can be made to perform this task; for example, if the stone is tied to a string it can alternately fall and reascend like a pen- dulum. But if the stone hits an obstacle its kinetic energy is converted into heat-energy. There is still the same quantity of energy, but even if we could scrape it together and put it through an engine we could not lift the stone back with it. What has happened to 'make the energy no longer serviceable? Looking microscopically at the falling stone we see an enormous multitude of molecules moving downwards with equal and parallel velocities- an organized motion like the march of a regi- ment. We have to notice two things, the energy, and the organization of the energy. To return to its original height the stone must preserve both of them. When the stone falls on a sufficiently elastic surface the motion may be reversed without destroying the organization. Each molecule is turned backwards and the whole array retires in good order to the starting-point. The famous Duke of York With twenty thousand men, He marched them up to the top of the hill And marched them down again. History is not made that way. But what usually happens at the impact is that the molecules suffer more or less random collisions and rebound in all directions. They no longer conspire to make progress in any one direction; they have lost their organization. Afterwards they continue to collide with one another and keep changing their direction of motion, but they never again find a common purpose. Organization cannot be brought about by continued shuffling. And so, although the energy remains quantitatively sufficient (apart from unavoidable leakage which we suppose made good), it cannot lift the stone back. To restore the stone we must supply extraneous energy which has the required amount of organization.6 5 The Nature of the Physical World, p. 67. Î² Ibid,, p. 70.</page><page sequence="5">356 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY A similar use of the term "organization" occurs at many other places in Eddington's writings.7 In the above example it seems to mean no more than a group of uniformly directed motions, and such an order might conceivably be regarded as the most primitive form of organi- zation. But to the biologist there is a sharp contradiction between this use of the term, and hence the view that the organization in the universe is perpetually decreasing; and his own use of it which is associated with the evolutionary process. Here, in a part of the uni- verse, at any rate, organization is always increasing. The matter is brought to a head when we find a physical chemist8 describing the laws of probability and the second law of thermo- dynamics as the "law of morpholysis." This is well calculated to astonish the evolutionary morphologist, and makes imperative the effort to clarify the terminological situation. Modern biology is nothing if not evolutionary. There are now no reasonable grounds for doubt that during successive ages after the first appearance of life upon the earth it took up a succession of new forms, each more highly organized than the last. This is not gainsaid in any way by the existence of parasitism and retrogression in certain types of plants and animals, nor by the fact that a hun- dred disadvantageous mutants may have to be produced for every one which is of evolutionary value. It is surprising that the theory of biological organization is still in such a backward state. Though there are few penetrating accounts of it in the literature, every biologist has a rough working idea of what he means by it. Here one may per- haps say that as we rise in the taxonomic scale from the protozoa to the social primates, there is (1) a rise in the number of parts of the organism and the complexity of their geometrical shapes, (2) a rise in the effectiveness of the control of their functions by the organism as a whole, (3) a rise in the degree of independence of the organism from its environment, (4) a rise in the effectiveness with which the organism carries out its purposes. There is nothing vitalistic about these criteria. All the levels of biological organization are higher than the physico-chemical level, hence it is only natural that regularities will be expected to occui in them which cannot be seen at any physico-chemical level. But this 7 E.g., ibid., p. 104. 8R. E. D. Clark, in School Science Review, xxi (1939)Â» PÂ· 83^ XXI (l9^Â°)* Î¡Â· Î¹Î·7Â·</page><page sequence="6">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 357 is not to say that biochemistry and biophysics are not the funda- mental sciences of biology. A living organism is both a "patterned mixed-up-ness," and a "patterned separatedness." The mere fact of the aggregation of millions of cells together into a functioning meta- zoon necessitates the provision of efficient means of control of the whole. Hence the mysterious similarity between the view that we see when looking down a microscope at a transparent blood-vessel, and the view of Broadway from the top of a skyscraper. Hence the myste- rious similarity between the aspect of nerve fibres and the pyloned wire striding across the countryside. Those thinkers who apply bio- logical analogies to human society and its products are as foolish as any who would try to persuade us that there really are micro-tele- phone operators within the coelenterate nerve-net. The point is that the works of organization have a certain similarity at all levels of their operation. Furthermore, it is in general true that the higher the level of bio- logical organization, the more independent of the environment the organism is. Among the higher types decrease in number of repro- ductive products and corresponding increase of parental care illus- trate this, and vast chapters of comparative physiology and biochem- istry are devoted to the origin and development in evolution of body- temperature regulation, desiccation control, adjustment of the composition of the blood, and the like. "The constancy of the in- ternal medium," said Claude Bernard, in an aphorism expounded by Bancroft,9 "is the condition of all free life." Nor is there in pur- posiveness anything that lies outside the scientific frame of reference. The Aristotelian theory of causation is irrelevant. Biological pur- posiveness and adaptation are concepts inseparable from biological facts, and as Donnan10 has shown, there exist branches of mathematics, such as integral analysis, which may be able to cope with systems whose behavior differs according to their past history. Consciousness is the highest phase of this behavior, and when the organizational level is reached at which psychological phenomena first appear, socio- logical phenomena appear too. One may say that biological organiza- tion is as much an organization of processes as of structures. 9J.

G. Donnan in Acta Biotheoretica, 11 (1936), p. 1.</page><page sequence="7">358 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY The point at issue is, then, whether the concepts of organization as used by physicists and by biologists have anything in common. II It is curious that this difficulty has not been more widely felt. Some thinkers have, indeed, been acutely troubled by it, for instance Rusk,11 who speaks of a "conflict of currents/' the physical world los- ing organization and the biological world gaining it. So also Levy,12 in his popular exposition of the sciences, remarks: The fact is that the second law of thermodynamics, which regards sys- tems as passing from orderly arrangement to disorderly randomness, classifies any future pattern or more complex orderly arrangement that may arise subsequent to the original order, as one of the innumerable accidental situations that have no special significance for man; as if a complex computing machine were indeed a random combination of parts. It may indeed mean that the energy of the original material from which the metal was drawn is now less available in one sense, but as a computing machine, it has now made available a mass of energy that was not previously capable of being tapped. Side by side, therefore, with the second law of thermodynamics, in so far as it may be valid for large-scale systems- if it is so valid- there must exist a law for the evolu- tion of novel forms of aggregated energy and the emergence of new qualities. A generalization of this nature has not yet been made, but that a general rule of this type must exist is evident. One wonders why Levy did not allude at this point to the law of biological, psychological and sociological evolution. Long before, Engels, whom nothing escaped, had faced the problem, as we see from the following passage in his Ludwig Feuerbach: It is not necessary here to go into the question of whether this mode of outlook [evolutionary dialectical materialism] is thoroughly in accord with the present position of natural science which predicts a possible end for the earth, and for its habitability a fairly certain one; which therefore recognizes that for the history of humanity also there is not only an ascending but also a descending curve. At any rate we still find ourselves a considerable distance from the turning point at which the historical course of society becomes one of descent, and we cannot expect H R. D.

This was a sensible approach, but it was made in 1885, before the second law of thermodynamics had attained its present position of canonical importance, and be- fore its interpreters had challenged the biologists by appropriating the term "organization." One reason why the apparent contradiction between the second law and the process of evolution has not caused more perplexity is that the attention of those few scientific thinkers who try to unify the world-view of science has been largely directed towards the ques- tion of the existence of disentropic phases within living matter it- self. From the description of the second law already given it must have been quite clear that this generalization has a statistical basis, and hence that if we had to deal with vessels so small that individual "complexions" could be separated, the statistical law valid for swarms of them might not in all cases hold good. Disentropic, "unusual," fluctuations might then, if amplified (and amplification is a process at which living matter is very efficient) account for such phenomena of high organizational level as "free will." Such a point of view has been ably put by R. S. Lillie,14 and discussed by Donnan.15 It would be related to the standpoint of G. N. Lewis,16 who describes living organisms as "cheats in the game of entropy." They alone [he wrote] seem able to breast the great stream of apparently irreversible processes. These processes tear down, living things build up. While the rest of the world seems to move towards a dead level of uni- formity, the living organism is evolving new substances and more and more intricate forms.17 13 F.

It is simply that no evidence of any infraction of the second law on the part of living organisms has ever been forthcoming, and on the contrary there is a great deal of evi- dence that they obey it. Their life is always associated with, and depends upon, the processes of metabolism, in which there is always a net loss of free energy, complex organic compounds being broken down to CO2 and water, and their energy being dispersed as irre- coverable heat. The processes of metabolism, moreover, are invari- ably very inefficient.18 The idea that living organisms might be cheats in the game of en- tropy originated from the conception of the so-called Clerk-Maxwell demon. Clerk-Maxwell, in his expositions of the second law, found it convenient to picture a vessel divided into two compartments which were connected by a hole and a trap-door which could be opened and shut at will by a "being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course."19 The demon could thus let through fast molecules but not slow ones, in which case, starting from a uniform temperature, one side would get hot and the other side cold. He could therefore easily, in Kelvin's words,20 make water run uphill, one end of a poker red-hot and the other ice-cold, and sea-water fit to drink. The idea has thus been often put forward that living organ- isms evade the second law. "Es gibt seine DÃ¤monen/' wrote Driesch;21 "w ir selbst sind sie!' But as Clark22 rightly says, what had really been proved was not that the second law was inapplicable to living matter, but that, if a mind could deal with individual mole- cules, and if it had suitable frictionless apparatus at its disposal, and if it was desirous of doing so at the moment when an observer hap- pened to be looking, it could decrease entropy. These conditions are never, in practice, fulfilled. So far as we know, living organisms and their minds cannot handle molecules individually. The Max- wellian demon had in fact been endowed in its definition with just 18 See J. Needham "Recent Developments in the Philosophy of Biology," Quarterly Review of Biology, in (1928), p. 77. 19 J.

And our minds do not exist "in a vacuum,'* created from nothing; they belong to the highest stage in an evolutionary process, con- tinuous back to the most primitive single living cells. But the para- dox is that in all this arranging, sorting and ordering which living things perform, there is never any infringement of the second law of thermodynamics. Ill At this point I wish to pause before pursuing the argument fur- ther in order to meet the criticism that the whole question is of purely academic interest. What difference does it make, one may ask, whether the world is thought to be "running down" or not, or whether the emergence of novelty in evolution is real? The answer is that our ideas on these questions have very marked and sometimes unrealized effects on our social behavior. The social significance of the first law of thermodynamics, i.e., the law of the conservation of energy, has long been realized. It was one of the basic pillars required for the development of industrial civili- zation, as the physicists of the last century themselves knew very well. Crowther has summarized the matter: The discovery of the conservation of energy is connected with the no- tion of exchange value. Capitalist civilization cannot be operated with- out an exact knowledge of the equivalence of different forms of energy. . . . When coal, electricity, gas and labour are to be sold in exchange, they must be measured and a common currency found for them. That currency is energy.23 And again: All matter appeared to be made of electricity; industrial civilization had at length succeeded in interpreting the universe in terms of one of its own concepts. The cosmos was conceived as made of one universal world material, electricity.24 Thus the thought introduced by the pre-Socratic Iionian philoso- phers 2500 years before, came to fruition. Thomson25 has reminded us, in connection with the tyrant Midas and the first invention of 23 J. G. Crowther, The Social Relations of Science (London, 1941), p. 409. 24 Loc. cit., p. 455. 25 G.

Fire is exchanged for all things and all things for fire, just as goods for gold and gold for goods." As with the first law, so with the second. Since it involves the time process more profoundly than any other scientific law, it imme- diately brings up all the "first and last things" of theology, from the creation to the last judgment. It has been a godsend to theologians filled with pessimism about human affairs, and delighted to find sci- entific backing for their despite of nature- "the heavens shall perish . . . they shall all shall wax old as doth a garment." That arch-reac- tionary neo-Platonist, W. R. Inge, the former Dean of St. Paul's, devoted an entire book to demonstrating that since the universe is steadily approaching a state of thermal equilibrium and immobility, therefore (1) all evolution and human progress is an illusion and (2) men should return to what he calls the philosophia perennis of Christianity, the conviction that all man's good lies in another life.26 We have here no continuing city, neither we ourselves nor the species to which we belong. Our citizenship is in heaven, in the eternal world to which even in this life we may ascend in heart and mind.27 So far as I can see [he goes on] the purposes of God in history are finite, local, temporal, and for the most part individual. They all seem to point beyond themselves to the "intelligible world" beyond the bourne of time and place. ... In so far as the modern doctrine of the pre- destined progress of the species is only a spectral residuum of traditional eschatology, I think we must be prepared to surrender it.28 Elsewhere in the same book Inge remarks in the very spirit of the ecclesiastical department of the bourgeoisie: "Those who throw all their ideas into the future are as bankrupt as those who lent their money to the Russian or German governments during the war."29 26 God and the Astronomers (London, 1933). I confess that the general level of the argument in this book, though not its trend, reminds me of the well-known story in which a lecturer was giving a popular talk on the subject of the second law of thermo- dynamics and its implications. As soon as the meeting was thrown open for discussion, a member of the audience rose and said: "How long, sir, did you say it would be before the universe ran completely down?" The lecturer replied that he had said seven hun- dred million years. His questioner heaved a deep sigh of relief and said: "Thank God! I thought you had said seventy million years." 27 Ibid., p. 137. 2Sibid., p. 172. 2Â» Ibid., p. 28.</page><page sequence="12">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 363 In justice to the theologians, it must be admitted that some have strongly contested Inge's views, notably Rashdall.30 Another reason for which theologians or theologically minded scientists extol the second law is that it is tempting to identify the "winding-up" process, whatever it was, which started our galaxy off on its course with a maximum of free energy, with the act of creation by a personal deity. This always seems to me extremely premature, for we have no evidence that the universe does not operate in a cyclical way, periods of entropy-increase alternating with the appear- ance of new free energy. Milne31 has pointed out that "the arrow of time" should more properly be regarded as a flight of arrows, since other galaxies are not at the same stage of their development as ours. Moreover, it may be that at the "edges" of the universe-if this ex- pression means anything- free energy is continually being formed, so that like animals living in a stream or pipe which find the water always going by, we should see our world always "running down" but never reaching the end of the process. For those who like theo- logical speculation, this might be regarded as a modern form of the doctrine of the "General Concourse" in which God must ever uphold the universe which he created. But I am unable to see that these speculations do anyone any good except those who are concerned to give ideological justification to ideas associated with backward social tendencies. It would be far better to await the further dis- coveries of astronomy and astro-physics with an open mind. Thinkers approach the second law, therefore, with various forms of tacit bias, and these should be taken into account in considering what they say. One welcomes the degradation of energy and the dis- integration of the world in the interests of other-worldy theology; another seeks evidence for a creator. I have no reason to suppose that I am without bias myself; insofar as anyone can state his own with any accuracy, I find the background of my thought to be the elucidation of the nature of life and man, the definition of the direc- tion in which evolution has occurred, and the establishment of hope for man's struggles towards the perfect social order. The reason why the contradiction between the two concepts of organization is so important is because the world-view, and hence the behavior, of men 30 H. Rashdall, Ideas and Ideals (London, 1928). 31 E. A. Milne, Relativity, Gravitation and World Structure (Oxford, 1935), p. 286.</page><page sequence="13">364 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY in general is deeply affected by the "first and last things" of the world and of life and man within it. IV We may now proceed to consider the two views which may be held about this contradiction. They are as follows: (1) The concepts of organization as held by physicists and biolo- gists are the same, but all biological, and hence social, organization is kept going at the expense of an over-compensating degradation of energy in metabolic upkeep. (2) The two concepts are quite different and incommensurable. We should distinguish between order and organization. First of all, can we find the first of these opinions explicitly stated? It is not difficult to do so. The physicist SchrÃ¶dinger refers to the matter in his interesting book Science and the Human Tem- perament: We are convinced [he writes] that the second law governs all physical and chemical processes, even if they result in the most intricate and tangled phenomena, such as organic life, the genesis of a complicated world of organisms from primitive beginnings, and the rise and growth of human cultures. In this connection the physicist's belief in a con- tinually increasing disorder seems somewhat paradoxical, and may easily lead to a very pessimistic misunderstanding of a thesis which ac- tually implies nothing more than the specific meaning assigned to it by the physicist. Therefore a word of explanation is necessary. We do not wish to assert anything more than that the total balance of disorder in nature is steadily on the increase. In individual sections of the universe, or in definite material systems, the movement may well be towards a higher degree of order, which is made possible because an adequate compensation occurs in some other systems. Now according to what the physicist calls "order," the heat stored up in the sun represents a fabulous provision for order, in so far as this heat has not yet been distributed equally over the whole universe (though its definite ten- dency is towards that dispersion) but is for the time being concentrated within a relatively small portion of space. The radiation of heat from the sun, of which a small proportion reaches us, is the compensating process making possible the manifold forms of life and movement on the earth, which frequently present the features of increasing order. A small fraction of this tremendous dissipation suffices to maintain life on the earth by supplying the necessary amount of "order," but of course</page><page sequence="14">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 365 only so long as the prodigal parent, in its own frantically uneconomic way, is still able to afford the luxury of a planet which is decked out with cloud and wind, rushing rivers and foaming seas, and the gorgeous finery of flora and fauna and the striving millions of mankind.32 Thus in this charming passage we are to visualize biological order as identical with that order which thermodynamically is always dis- appearing, the local increase being more than compensated for by the decrease due to the cooling of the sun. Eddington, though more uncertainly, adopts a like view, in his New Pathways in Science, In using entropy as a signpost for time we must be careful to treat a properly isolated system. Isolation is necessary because a system can gain organization by draining it from other contiguous systems. Evo- lution shows us that more highly organized systems develop as time goes on. This may be partly a question of definition, for it does not follow that organization from the evolutionary point of view is to be reckoned according to the same measure as organization from the entropy point of view. But in any case these highly developed systems may obtain their energy by a process of collection, not by creation. A human being as he grows from past to future becomes more and more highly organ- ized-or so he fondly imagines. At first sight this appears to contradict the signpost law that the later instant corresponds to the greater disor- ganization. But to apply the law we must make an isolated system of him. If we prevent him from acquiring organization from external sources, if we cut off his consumption of food and drink and air, he will before long come to a state which everyone would recognize as a state of extreme "disorganization."33 Here, then, are statements of the view that there is no essential difference between thermodynamic and biological order. No doubt this is the simpler of the two alternatives. Among the reflections which have led thinkers to support it is a recognition of the irreversibility which exists both in the second law and in biological evolution. The pioneer work of the palaeontolo- gist Dollo34 led to the generalization which has since been called by his name. An organ which has been reduced in the course of evolu- tionary development never again reaches its original importance, 32 E. SchrÃ¶dinger, Science and Human Temperament (London, 1935), p. 39. 33 A.

Further, if in connection with adaptation to a new environment (such as aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial life) an organ is lost which was valuable in the previous environment, and if, as often happens, a secondary return to the previous environment occurs, this organ will not reappear. In its place some other organ will form a substitute. In a word, evolution is reversible in the sense that structures which have been gained can be lost, but it is irreversible in the sense that, once lost, these structures can never be regained. Since Dollo's time it has been shown that his generalizations hold good, not only for the morphological body-structures which he elucidated, but also for numerous physiological and biochemical adaptations.35 In explanation, Dollo himeslf did not go much further than a vague appeal to the "indestructibility of the past." "In the last analysis," he wrote, "it is, like other natural law, a question of prob- ability. Evolution is a summation of determined individual vari- ations in a determined order. For it to be reversible, there would have to be as many causes, acting in the inverse sense, as those which brought about the individual variations [mutations, as we should say today] which were the source of the prior transformations and their fixation. Such circumstances are too complex for us to suppose that they ever exist." This idea has something in common with the second law of thermodynamics. The universe is always passing from less probable to more probable states. The position was further elaborated in the brilliant and unique book of Lotka, who defined evolution as the history of any system undergoing irreversible changes, and practically identified the process with the second law. But although his discussion is one of the three or four greatest contributions to biological thought of the present century, he never really faces the problem that the second law involves a decrease, and the law of evolution an increase, of order. His pleasure at being able to unite all forms of irreversibility under one law leads him to an undue denigration of the genuine rise in level of organization which evolution shows. Evolution, he rightly maintains, is not a mere changeful sequence. Mere unlike- ness of two days does not tell us which preceded the other. It is necessary to know something of the character of this unlikeness. 35 By J. Needham, "Contributions of Chemical Physiology to the Problem of Reversi- bility in Evolution," Biological Review, xin (1938), p. 225.</page><page sequence="16">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 367 In a vague way [he goes on] this character is indicated by the term "progress," which is associated in popular conception with evolution. And the more rigorous disciplines of biology, too, leave us with a not very clearly defined idea of "progression" as one of the fundamental characteristics of those changes which are embraced by the term evolu- tion. Such phrases as the ' 'passage from lower to higher forms," which are often used to describe the direction of evolution, are vague, and un- doubtedly contain an anthropomorphic element. At best they give every opportunity for divergence of opinion as to what constitutes a "higher" form. If, on the other hand, it is stated that evolution proceeds from simpler to more complex forms, or from less specialized to more special- ized forms, then the direction is but poorly defined, for the rule is at best one with many exceptions.36 And to this he adds in a footnote the remark of Bertrand Russell: "A process which led from amoeba to man appeared to the philoso- phers to be obviously a progress- though whether the amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known." After which he proceeds to take irreversibility as the principal character of the evolutionary process. But this will not do. Denial of the rise in organizational level during evolution (and social evolution too) is not and cannot be acceptable to biologists. Definitions of what this means have been attempted above. Russell's wit is empty. It is mere verbiage (though it might be poetry) to talk about the opinions of molecules, or in that favorite phrase, "the hookworm's point of view" when its nervous system does not entitle it to have a point of view. Philoso- phers, on the contrary, are so entitled. Here Max Planck has a relevant passage: The second law of thermodynamics has frequently been applied outside physics. For example, attempts have been made to apply the principle that all physical events develop in one direction only, to biological evolution; a singularly unhappy attempt so long as the term evolution is associated with the idea of progress, perfection, or improvement. The principle of entropy is such that it can only deal with probabilities, and all that it really says is that a state, improbable in itself, is followed on the average by a more probable state. Biologically interpreted, this principle points towards degeneration rather than improvement. The 3Î² A. J.

V We come now to certain reflections which seem to suggest rather strongly that the thermodynamic principle of order is indeed funda- mentally different from the biological principle of organization. Biological organization depends universally upon aggregations of particles of high complexity. The molecule of protein, to say noth- ing of the paracrystalline protein micelle, is an entity so complex that though our analysis of it has begun, we are not as yet in sight of a clear understanding of it. Now although biological organiza- tion, as we have seen, depends everywhere on a continuing metabolic upkeep, energy entering the plan as light or the animal as chemical energy in the foodstuffs, and being degraded in combustions and dissipated as heat; biological organization is only the extrapolation of patterns already to be found in the non-living world. We cannot make any sharp line of distinction between the living and the non- living. At the level of the sub-microscopic viruses, they overlap. Some particles show some of the properties of life but not others. Some "dead" protein molecules are much bigger than the particles of some "living" viruses. Particles which show the properties of life can be had in paracrystalline, and even in crystalline, form. There are many similarities between the morphology and behavior of crystals and living organisms.38 Among the patterns found in the non-living world, crystalline arrangement, and above all the arrangement of the more complex liquid crystals, is doubtless the most highly ordered and organized. But below the crystalline level there is the molecular level, and be- low that again the level of the atoms, some of which have a much more complex "solar system" of elementary physical particles than others. When crystals form spontaneously they do so in processes 37 M. Planck, The Philosophy of Physics (London, 1936), p. 101. 38 cf. such books as H. Przibram, Die anorganische Grenzgebiete der Biologie (Berlin, 1926), and F. Rinne, Grenzfragen des Lebens (Leipzig, 1931).</page><page sequence="18">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 369 which involve decreases in free energy. The physicist must therefore say that disorder has increased, but the biologist, as a student of patterns, cannot but say that there is more order and organization in the well-arranged crystal than in its homogeneous mother-liquor or its corresponding gas. So also in the development of our world. In its earliest stages, we are told, there were nothing but the elemen- tary physical particles, and conditions were such that the atoms of the elements we know could not exist. But as the temperature of the earth grew colder, the atoms of the elements became stable and at last even the heaviest ones, with their dozens of revolving electrons, were able to persist. Here, from the biologist's point of view, pattern and organization had increased, but certainly from the physicist's point of view, order had decreased. The chaos which ensues upon the degradation of energy cannot therefore be the same chaos which existed at the beginning of the world before the atoms of the elements were stable. For that chaos coincided with a maximum of free energy, and the former with its minima. The point is, therefore, (1) that we cannot refuse to extend the concept of organization downwards to include non-living patterned aggregations,39 and (2) that since these require no continuing meta- bolic upkeep for their persistence, the "metabolic" theory which asserts that biological order and thermodynamic order are identical, but that the former is over-compensated, should be rejected in favor of a wider generalization. We are led, in fact, to the second hypo- thesis mentioned above, namely that the thermodynamic order and biological organization are entirely different things. Only we should now perhaps have to call the latter by some such term as "holistic" in order to indicate that pattern is not the biologist's perquisite, but occurs also at non-living levels. Let us now return to the fundamental definition of Willard Gibbs- entropy is "mixed - up - ness." The opposite of mixed - up - ness is separatedness, not organization. From this point of view, one can see that in the early stages of our world's development all the elementary particles of physics were in fact separated from one another, and free energy was then at its maximum. But as time went on, the temperature fell, and mixed - up - ness increased- or perhaps 39 It should be noted that this conclusion is also that of certain philosophies: the emergent evolutionism of Lloyd-Morgan and others, the organic mechanism of White- head, and the dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels.</page><page sequence="19">370 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY we ought to say that time went on because mixed - up - ness in- creased. The basic misconception we have unearthed comes to light here, namely that mixed - up - ness necessarily means chaotic mixed - up - ness; but on the contrary there may also be patterned mixed - up - ness. Indeed it is hard to see how the most complex patterns could ever have been formed if there were not a number of different elements from which they could be formed. The world of life is a painting in full colors, not a monochrome. If this is accepted, we must make a sharp distinction between thermodynamic order or separatedness and biological organization or patterned mixed - up - ness. And the general upshot would be that the world has been moving steadily from a condition of universal separatedness (order) to one of general chaotic mixed - up - ness (thermodynamic disorder) plus local organization (patterned mixed - up - ness). The point could perhaps be illustrated by a homely analogy. Inside the nursery cupboard there are certain large boxes of bricks, each box containing bricks of identical color and shape. When they are all tumbled out in confusion on the nursery floor we have the highly probable universe of the thermodynamician. But when in one corner of the room the bricks are assembled into a factory or a railway station, we have an analogy for the organizing activities of life. There are two kinds of mixed - up - ness, indistinguishable for the physicist, but clearly visible to the biologist who is on the look- out for patterns. The only thinker who seems to have arrived somewhere approaching this position is the late J. S. Haldane. Two quotations from his writings will enable us to take a bearing on it. In an important article in 1930 he wrote: Eddington has strikingly referred to the second law as time's pointer, since thermodynamic processes are irreversible. He also, however, as- sumes that the second law implies that everything which we can call or- ganization is tending to decay. By this unfounded assumption he raises, as it seems to me, insuperable difficulties for the main argument of his book. As matter cools down, what we call its specific heat progressively diminishes, and at very low temperatures this diminution becomes ex- tremely rapid. Now this implies that what seemed to be merely chaotic molecular energy, bandied about from molecule to molecule, loses this apparent character more and more as the temperature falls. A greater</page><page sequence="20">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 371 and greater part of its molecular energy is found to possess the form, not of removable heat, but of energy so co-ordinated or organized that, like the mechanical energy of the solar system, it does not waste itself on its surroundings. The conception of energy so organized has in recent years become perfectly familiar to physicists. An atom is no longer regarded as a unit of essentially inert mass in the Newtonian sense, but as a system of elec- trons and protons containing endless stores of energy so organized that it does not waste itself on the environment, or else wastes only a part of it in a sudden mutation of characteristically determined amount, known as a quantum. When we endeavor to relate the influence of organization to mechani- cal determination as interpreted on Newtonian principles, we are up against a difficulty which seems to me insuperable. The conceptions of matter and energy exclude the conceptions of essentially organized ac- tivity. We need a different conception in order to take in the observa- tions relating to organized activity. Nevertheless we still need the old Newtonian conceptions for ordinary practical purposes in physics. Physicists and mathematicians are at present struggling with this dilem- ma, which is similar to that which exists if we attempt to reconcile vitalism with a mechanistic interpretation of matter; but meanwhile I wish to point out once more that the old idea that the second law implies that our universe is progressing towards a state in which energy becomes either evenly diffused as heat of low temperature or non-ex- istent in any form, has gone by the board. It seems to me that the actual general picture presented to us by physical science is of a universe from which chaotic activity of every sort is progressively disappearing, and that this picture harmonizes with the conception of biological evolu- tion.40 And this must be complemented by the following, written six years later: From the standpoint at which the kinetic theory of gases originated all activity was fundamentally un-coordinated or chaotic, and the energy of the universe was degenerating towards a state in which its average temperature would be so uniform that no visible transference of molecu- lar into other forms of energy could occur, and ultimately all molecular activity would cease. But from the newer standpoint, co-ordinated ac- tivity is inherent in matter. With fall in temperature this inherent activity is not lost to it. As the temperature of a solid falls, the pro- 40 j. s. Haldane in The Realist, hi (1930), p. 10.</page><page sequence="21">372 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY portion of energy which can be withdrawn from it by a further fall in temperature diminishes till it becomes negligible. If the temperature of everything became uniform there could of course be no conversion of heat into gross mechanical motion. But even if the temperature fell to absolute zero everything would still be full of co-ordinated activity; and the evidence of co-ordinated activity, in the form of definite aggregations and combinations, would be more evident than at higher temperatures. The physically interpreted uni- verse as it appeared to the physicists of the last century seemed to be progressing continuously towards a state in which activity would be at a standstill. This conclusion was embodied in the second law of thermo- dynamics. For the newer physics, the universe appears in a different light. It is no longer towards a state of rest, but towards a state in which co-ordinated activity prevails over what had seemed to be nothing but chaotic activity, that the perceived universe is progressing. A grad- ual cooling down appears as a gradual disappearance of primitive chaos.41 We are thus to conclude that J. S. Haldane fully expressed the idea that though with the passage of time thermodynamic mixed - up - ness constantly increases, this mixture does not necessary give rise to chaotic states, but on the contrary involves much pattern and organ- ization. Indeed, we may find the first traces of pattern even in those "fortuitous concourses" of particles which gases and homogeneous liquids were formerly thought to be, for it is now thought that tem- porary associations of particles exist in these systems, though they are of a duration so transient that they can only be observed by special methods. Such organization would be around the molecular level. VI We have arrived, then, at the conclusion that thermodynamic order and biological organization are two quite different things. But this is not to say that there are no connections between them. What Haldane said illustrates some of the connections. And there is another very simple way of showing how pattern may arise where there was none before, through the operation of the law of entropy. If we return to the example given earlier of two vessels filled with gas at different temperatures, and isolated from all other environ- ment, we know, of course, that with the passage of time they will come 41 J. S. Haldane, The Philosophy of a Biologist (Oxford, 1936), p. 25.</page><page sequence="22">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 373 to exact thermal equilibrium. When this point is reached it will certainly not be possible to get any further work out of the system, but a pattern has now appeared where it was not before. The system has passed from asymetry to symmetry. It is, of course, a far cry from this simplest possible case of sym- metry to the extraordinarily complex patterns of symmetry produced by living things, but it may be that this apparently jejune idea hides a profound truth. Every stage in the thermodynamic primrose path to the everlasting (but very tepid) bonfire has its own criteria of stability. In the earliest stages when free energy was maximal, even the atoms of the elements were not stable. Later on the minerals of which the earth's geography was built were stable for a long time before any living protoplasm was stable. The fibrous proteins (essential for the construction and maintenance of the higher forms of life) 42 can be regarded as "degenerated" linear polymers of the globular proteins, which themselves, as the work of the ultra-centri- fuge school has shown, are polymers of a small and relatively simple unit. Polymerization, too, is a notable feature of the carbohydrate group. Now polymerization is a process which goes on with a de- crease of free energy, just as crystallization does, and since the most complex morphological forms require the most highly polymerized substances, Bernai 43 has pointed out that this fact helps to explain for us the contradiction between thermodynamic order and biologi- cal organization. From this point of view, life could be regarded as the character- istic stable form of the proteins. "Life," wrote Engels 44 in a famous definition, "is the mode of motion of the albuminous substances." So also in earlier essays, I was always deeply impressed by a fact so obvious that it never seemed to have occurred to many biological philosophers, namely that proteins, carbohydrates and fats are never found in colloidal combination anywhere outside living organisms 45 It was therefore irrelevant to demand of biologists that they should show the existence of similar phenomena in the inorganic world 42 Cf.

In Goethe's words: "Wer will das Lebendige erkennen und bescreiben Sucht erst den Geist herauszutreiben, Dann hat er nur die Teile in seine Hand, Fehlt leider ganz der geistige Band. 'Enche'vresin Naturae* nennt's die Chemie, Spottet ihrer Selbst, und weiss nicht wie/' which we might translate: "He who wishes to understand and de- scribe living organisms first seeks to draw out their spirit from them, but in his hands he finds nothing but the dead parts; the spiritual bond which united them has disappeared. Chemistry calls this just 'a property of nature' and by so doing insults itself, and does not even know why." The investigation of this "spiritual bond" by the methods of natural science is the task of biology, and we have known too many victories in the past to fall a prey now to the pessimism of Mephistopheles. It would be quite erroneous to say, therefore, that because thermodynamic order and biological organization are two quite different things, there is any conflict between them. Only as the time-process goes on, only as the cosmic mixing proceeds, only as the temperature of the world cools; do the higher forms of aggregation, the higher patterns and levels of organization, become possible. The law of evolution is a kind of converse of the second law of thermo- dynamics, equally irreversible but contrary in tendency. There remain one or two final points. First, we have not answered the question why a metabolic upkeep becomes necessary about the level of the beginnings of life. Basal metabolism, as it is called, that continuous slow rate of combustion which goes on all the time when the living organism is as much at rest as it can pos- sibly be, is classically described as the energy turnover required to "keep the organism in being as a physical system," to maintain sepa- ration of phases, do work at membranes, etc. It is fair to say that basal metabolism only appears slowly as we ascend the taxonomic scale. We hardly know as yet whether it is a concept which can be applied to bacteria, and there is much evidence that some forms of life, such as viruses, bacterial spores, and even some animal eggs, can remain for long periods of time in an inert state, consuming</page><page sequence="24">EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS 375 none of their stores and apparently as much without metabolism as any crystal. Presumably the higher living patterns do demand a good deal of additional energy to keep them going. Secondly, there is the question of measurement. The nature of holistic organization is certainly not susceptible of the same kind of measurement as thermodynamic mixed - up - ness, but we have no reason whatever for supposing that its measurement is impossible. When such a measurement has been achieved, it would be feasible to apply it also to human social evolution. I see no reason for doubt- ing the possibility of this. Mention of social evolution brings up a few reflections which inescapably present themselves. If the general principles here enunciated are sound, the most highly organized social communities should be the most stable, perhaps the most long-lasting. Here the social insects bear a testimony, for the forms of their different castes have been identified embedded in amber many thousands of years old, but they differ so severely from the primates in their mor- phology that they have less to teach us than is often supposed. The most highly organized social communities should also be the least wasteful. Hence it is significant that much of the criticism directed against our existing social order by those who wish to see a more highly organized state of society is precisely on the ground that our present arrangements are wasteful. Wasteful of human effort, when infinite care is devoted to the growing of a crop of coffee, only for it to be shoveled into locomotive fireboxes. Wasteful of energy, when heavy goods, the transport of which is not urgent, are transported by air or rail, while for purely financial reasons the canals lie unused or derelict. Is not injustice also wasteful? Is not the failure to utilize to the maximum the available talent and genius of men a wasteful thing? That great aggregation of mankind to which we all look forward will be nothing if not efficient. Cambridge University, England</page></plain_text>
