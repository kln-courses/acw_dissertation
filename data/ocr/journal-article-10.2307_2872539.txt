<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY IN TENNYSON'S POETRY TO THE 1842 POEMS BY HENRY KOZICKI This essay proposes to trace Tennyson's philosophy of history from his early readings, through the concepts he encountered among the "Apostles" at Cambridge, and finally to certain readings and influences of the later thirties. Three main ideas operate in his poetry: that an inscrutable but anthropomorphic deity presides over human affairs, that history occurs in cycles of differing shapes and duration, and that heroes are enmeshed in various ways in history's workings. Without an emotional nexus, however, such ideas are inherently neutral: fatefulness or cyclicity, for example, are neither distressing nor stimulating, save as thinking makes them so. Emo- tional coloring - and therefore a whole philosophy of history - obtains when the ideas are slanted and qualified: a "despairingl" view of history may be suggested by, say, inimical gods, distorted cycles, useless heroes, and the appropriate embellishments. The obverse is patently a "&lt;cheerful" view with loving gods, normal cycles, and heroes doing their duty. This paper describes the slants and tonal changes in such ideas in some Tennyson poetry to the 1842 Poems, from an early naive faith in providential history, during which divinity is palpably present, cycles offer no terrors, and the hero is powerful in his mandated strength; through the unhappiness of the early thirties, when the transcendent begins to fade, the hero to grow old, weak, and ineffective, and society to degenerate in a malformed cycle; and finally to the more sanguine late thirties, when the poet re-accepts the subtle ways of history: divinity is now suffused in the historical process, the cycle brings a fire-birth of new forms, and the hero is again an agent of this redemption. The parallel development of the discursive understanding and the emotional context may suggest that one is a correlative of the other, but giving precedence to either may be an exercise in ingenious distinction. Microcosmic and macrocosmic historical apprehensions work to- gether to produce certain poetic strategies, using historical refer- ents in both rational and emotional ways. Tennyson's interest in history is seldom stressed enough in in- 88 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="2">terpretations of his poetry, but it began early and lasted throughout his life. By the age of seventeen he had read Tacitus, Pliny, Suetonius, Voltaire, the Bible, Hume, Gibbon, Rennell on Herodotus, and various travel literature. Two dominant traits de- veloped early in Tennyson's thought: a Christian orthodoxy in matters of historical explanation, and a passion for historical specta- cle. He read in Rollin's Ancient History, a standard work that had instructed generations of youth, that nations developed because God "conducted their enterprises . . . till they had executed their commission,"' which is philosophy of history in containing both an historical explanation and an emotional conviction. Complementing this orthodoxy was Tennyson's enchantment with the splendor of the past, deriving from his readings in Ossian, Byron, Moore, and especially Scott, who (as Carlyle pointed out) "taught all men this truth . . . that the bygone ages of the world were actually filled by living men, not by protocols, state papers, controversies and abstrac- tions of men." This leads not to antiquarian delights - not "chroni- cle," in Croce's distinction - but intense empathy with the living past. A passionate acceptance of the richness of providential history characterizes Tennyson's contributions to the 1827 Poems bi Two Brothers,2 where the three basic ideas of transcendence, cyclicity, and hero are present in a certain naive and fervid faith, laced about with footnotes of fashionable historical scholarship. It is clear in "The High-Priest to Alexander" that Alexander is the agent of the Lord, "For the God of gods, which liveth / Through all eternity, / 'Tis he alone which giveth / And taketh victory." In ""God's Denuncia- tions against Pharaoh-Hophra," Ezekiel tells Nebuchadnezzar to "Arm, arm for the battle - the Lord leads thee on!" even if in dreadful slaughters. All nations have commissions in the hurly-burly of history. "Signs on earth and signs on high / Prophesied thy destiny," says the poet to the city in "The Fall of Jerusalem." But all nations, including the Hebrew, suffer cyclic disaster one by the other in this providential fabric. Macedonia rises and Persia falls in "Persia, with Alexander contrasted with Cyrus ("the one founder, the other destroyer, of the powerful empire of Persia," as Rollin observed). Nadir Shah and Persia come to prominence as India is sacked and destroyed in "The Expedition of Nadir Shah into Hin- dostan." Pizarro conquers in "Lamentation of the Peruvians" as Ataliba and Peru sink into oblivion. Rome declines as the Goths rise in "The Druid's Prophecies." In this traditional acceptance of a fiery concatenation of cycles, the prophet-hero is pivotally engaged. The Henry Kozicki 89</page><page sequence="3">young poet sympathizes with the hero, as in "The Exile's Harp," has little time for humanity's tragic lot, and does not attempt to deal with the complexities of historical causality. Tennyson brought this "Passion of the Past"3 into a most receptive company of gifted young men at Cambridge: the "Apostles" among whom, as Buckley remarks, he "obtained his real Cambridge education."4 First led by F. D. Maurice, the group s founder, and by John Sterling, the mentors of the Apostles when Tennyson arrived were Julius Hare and Connop Thirlwall, two of the most advanced thinkers in England at this time, purveyors of German research and speculation, and the intellectual leaders - along with Thomas Arnold, H. H. Milman, A. P. Stanley, and Richard Whately - of what was to be called the "Liberal Anglican" school of history. Within the immediate circle of the Apostles during Tennyson's stay, Thirlwall was preparing to write his eight-volume History of Greece, Merivale a History of the Romans under the Empire, and Hare and Thirlwall had already translated Niebuhr's seminal The History of Rome and were active in promulgating his ideas. The great historian Niebuhr was known to Hare and Thirlwall personally and among the Apostles was, more than even Coleridge, Wordsworth, Kant, or Goethe, the "Cgod, who for a lengthy period formed all their sentiments."5 Under this collective excitement about history - even Hallam's father was a famous historian and Tennyson's tutor William Whewell a soon- to-be historian of science - Tennyson's philosophy of history un- derwent change, sophistication, and confirmation. The Liberal Anglicans can be characterized by a primary tenet of passionate identity with the past as a necessary condition to histori- cal understanding, by Christian reverence, and by advanced, subtle, and scientific positions in regard to the historian's craft. Niebuhr for example believed fervently in an intuitive power by which a scrupulously examined body of evidence is laid into a frame of reference (a power his critics complained was an "occult faculty of historical divination"s). Thomas Arnold who like all Liberal Angli- cans regarded Niebuhr as a master reflects Niebuhr's divinatory sense in his remarks about the historian having to have a "sense of reality about the Romans," so as to be "living in a manner amongst them."7 The poetic equivalent of this historical empathy animates many of the poems Tennyson wrote at Cambridge. "In deep and solemn dreams," for example, a poem begun at Somersby but com- pleted at Cambridge, displays a mystic meditation on the past by which the poet sees "Great cities by an ocean blue. . . sunny faces of lost days, / Long to mouldering dust consigned, / Forms which live 90 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="4">but in the mind. / Then methinks they stop and stand, / And I take each by the hand, / And we speak . .." The idea turns almost solipsistic in his 1829 "The Idealist": "I am the citadels and palaces / Of all great cities: I am Rome, / Tadmor, and Cairo: I am Place and Time .. Along with this "historical imagination," Niebuhr believed in providential history. He condemned the atheism, abstract intellec- tualizing, and mechanical '"progressivism"' of the French philosophes, and instead urged (in almost the same words as Augustine's) that it was "destiny had saved Rome in her perils ... in which we cannot but recognize the finger of God."8 The Liberal Anglicans, the Apostles, and Tennyson, needless to say, subscribed to such principles and also rejected French "organic" history with its principle of Mind in History growing irresistibly forever by scien- tific law, hateful because the implicit determinism seemed to deny God and the freedom of the will. In Forbes' words, " 'Civilization' and the 'March of Mind' were assumptions which the Liberal Angli- cans could not accept, because they dispensed with God's Provi- dence," and he notes that "both Vico and Niebuhr strengthened the Liberal Anglican belief in Providence" (pp. 8, 60). Tennyson's loathing for French progressivism may be judged from an 1832 letter in which he speaks of Saint-Simonism as "proof of the immense mass of evil that is extant in the nineteenth century, and a focus which gathers all its rays" (Memoir, I, 99).9 If Tennyson was confirmed, then, in the validity of historical intuition and in a providential universe, his three basic ideas were subject to extension and refining in the complexities of Liberal Anglican thought. There are two kinds of providence: active and ordinary. Active providence had been much in evidence in the early ages of the world, in the Christian revelation, and in miracles. It is present in extraordinary events like earthquakes and plague, and in such historical events as the outcome of the Punic Wars and the retreat from Moscow. Ordinary providence, on the other hand, covers the laws of nature at large, those racial and geographical differences as explain national character, and the laws of normal history or the whole cycle of the nation's existence. The distinction is crucial and complex. Man lifts his collective life upward by tapping providence, for as Hare wrote, "It is the idea of God that lifts us out of the eddying flux and reflux of time,"10 but "when a nation loses its hold on religion it collapses back into the natural cycles of growth and decay, and, like a plant, dies inevitably" (Forbes, sum- marizing the beliefs of Niebuhr and the Liberal Anglicans, p. 98), Henry Kozicki 91</page><page sequence="5">which is the plane of ordinary providence, whose laws a nation must be reverent to determine and observe. The two providential conditions can be distinguished in some poems Tennyson wrote at Cambridge. In his 1829 Prize Poem "Timbuctoo," reworked from the "Armageddon" of perhaps five years earlier, the "great Angel Mind" seems an anthropomorphic embodiment of active providence in history, saying, "Oh City! oh latest Throne! where I was raised / To be a mystery of loveliness." Against the background of cities lost in cyclic time, he indicates with an image of linear progress how he inspires men to shadow forth the Unattainable: "step by step to scale that mighty stair / Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds / Of glory'of Heaven." Tennyson's note to these lines - "Be ye perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect" suggests that his understanding of such progress is indebted to Hare, who in his 1827 Guesses at Truth first warns against French progressivism - "the belief in the perfectibil- ity, or even in the progressiveness of mankind ... [has] much of erroir ... mixt up with it" - and makes it plain that God "set His own absolute perfection as the aim of our endeavour before us, by that blessed command, - Be ye perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect. ' l Yet the natural world in which the cycle prevails is also God's field through ordinary providence. In "The Lotos-Eaters," dating from 1830, the spiritual collapse of Ulysses and the mariners is put in ternms of a withdrawal from active providence, from historical trial and the "war with evil," but Tennyson shows that in suffering historical obsolescence and engulfment in nature the mariners do not become evil thereby. They merely revert to organic purposeful- ness, a peaceful somnolence where they will be cyclically as leaf, apple, and the flower that "ripens in its place, / Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil, / Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil." Some will even scale "'the ancient heights divine"' (as the poet climbed "'Timbuctoo" 's "Mountain") and there vegetate deliriously. In a sense, the mariners' condition is the complement of what is occur- ring in Ithaca: there the wheel of history is revolving and "sons inherit" (lines added for the 1842 edition but a recurring theme in Tennyson). The coming malevolence of the godhead in Tennyson's poetry, however, is foreshadowed in the mariners' vision of gods who are "careless of mankind," who "smile in secret, looking over wasted lands . . . Clanging fights, and flaming towns." Worse, the mariners attribute a maliciousness to a traditional area of active providence: "Blight and famine, plague and earthquake." 92 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="6">While the natural cycle - the second idea of' Tennyson 's philosophy of history - is a condition of' ordinary providence, it is still a sign of moral fault, a falling away from active providence. It is both "natural" and a sign of that "fallen nature" that is at the heart of the Christian understanding of the world. Much commentary on Tennyson's poetry goes awry over the inevitability apparently sug- gested by the organic metaphor,'2 but the Liberal Anglicans are at pains to deny man's entrapment in deterministic processes. Man's flawed nature, not the "laws" of nature, causes his moral and historical will to flag and sink. An 1840 essay by Stanley discusses the "error" of the corporeal analogy and the "truth" of the "'moral analogy which forms the basis of belief in a national providence" and "rfurnishes a complete answer to the error which would substitute for it belief in a national fatalism" (p. 58). Man can escape the cycle if his moral resolve is great enough, because his acts are free and because God's providence is continually available to him, particularly at the inception of historical enterprises. Because of the freedom of the will, the role of the hero - the third idea of Tennyson's philosophy of history - is crucial within the providential universe. Not wholly free to do as he likes, nor trapped in either deterministic cycles or inevitable progress, the hero rep- resents the dynamic of his nation in aspiring to perfection morally and therefore historically. The idea of the hero no doubt is rooted in the hero-worship of the times, but is also an ancient concept funda- mental to Christian thought. A succession of' hero-prophets intuited the providential will and guided Hebrew history, and Christ com- prehends mystically the history of the human race. But the typologi- cal chain does not end there. According to the principle of' accom- modation - "the key-point of the Liberal Anglican philosophy of history," according to Forbes (p. 64) - progressive revelation is made available to a continuing chain of hero-prophets. The Liberal Anglicans, however, were too sophisticated for simple euhemerisn and too hard-headed to be overly mystical about prophets. On the one hand, they were aware with Vico that every nation had its Hercules who "'founded the nations by their labors"'13 and so history with Carlyle was the "conflux and essence of all biographies"; on the other hand the hero as myth and legend was, in the words of Grote ( a famed historian and close friend of Thirlwall), "the divine and heroic faith of the people"14: their collective spiritual energy. Tennyson's unknown God is bodied forth in anthropomorphic symbols, as it was for Milton's Adam, Raphael saying, "What sur- mounts the reach / Of human sense I shall delineate so, / By lik'ning Henry Kozicki 93</page><page sequence="7">spiritual to corporal forms." All religions, said Hare in Guesses, "must of necessity be anthropomorphic. The idea of God must be adapted to the capacities of the human imagination" (p. 209). His son reports that Tennyson insisted "our highest view of God must be more or less anthropomorphic" (Memoir, I, 311). The presence of anthropomorphic symbols with which the hero can interact, then, can within those Tennyson poems that deal with history take on a significance beyond the ornamental. The poet in "Timbuctoo" stands upon the Mountain (in the earlier "Armageddon" this moun- tain "o'erlooks / The valley of Megiddo" - the traditional plain of decisive battles), sees the Angel, feels the touch of his hand, is suffused with prophetic utterance, and apprehends the nature of progress as a heavenly stair and the fate of earthly cities as waves on the time-river. In the 1830 "The Mystic," "Angels have talked with him, and showed him thrones"; this hero sees "imperishable pres- ences serene / Colossal" and "One mighty countenance of perfect calm / Awful with most invariable eyes." Tennyson can still be sanguine about divination and the anthropomorphic presence of God. Contrariwise, in many of the poems that Tennyson wrote in the early 1830's the sacred heights on which the hero may communicate the anthropomorphic divinity are becoming empty; even worse, when such symbols are glimpsed, they are beginning to be dreadful. If the speaker in "Timbuctoo" stood "vupon the Mountain which o'erlooks / The narrow seas whose rapid interval / Parts Afric from green Europe" and interacts with the Angel Mind, Hanno in "The Hesperides" (recited in October of 1830), while palpably in the same vicinity, is below that very "high-land leaning down a weight / Of cliffs" from which "Came voices, like the voices in a dream." These voices Hanno does not heed. No Hercules he; the heights go unscaled, the Sisters unconfronted, the Apples unravished. "The world is wasted with fire and sword," they sing as if in reference to all the violent cycles of history, "But the apple of gold hangs over the sea a vision of permanence inviting strength and conquest. It might be observed that Hanno was a prince of Carthage, a city soon to be dead in history. The mariners in "The Lotos-Eaters" see no anthropomorphic symbols of transcendence, only "Three thunder- cloven thrones of oldest snow"; inert and voiceless, they sit unhis- torically on their asphodel, and the world revolves in Ithaca. The soul in "The Palace of Art" after dwelling a time in "God-like isolation" suddenly sees in the dark corners of her palace "white- eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood, / And horrible nightmares" 94 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="8">and "Corpses three-month-old." She, like heroic aspiration, de- scends to mourn. The poetry Tennyson wrote at Cambridge reflects change influ- enced by the most advanced thought about history then available'5 and by the historical unrest then underway in England and Europe. The time of the early 1830's is commonly taken to be of unusual stress for Englishmen. Fears of revolution, then erupting over Europe, alternated with fears of tyranny and a near-paranoid, apocalyptic excitement attended the debates over the momentous Reform Bill of 1832. Given Tennyson's philosophy of history, such strains in the social order suggested trouble in the providential. Superimposed over these terrors in the macrocosmic order were grave difficulties in the microcosmic one: Tennyson's family situa- tion and his personal state of being. His father had long been going to pieces with drink, hatred, and murderous rages directed especially against his eldest son Frederick. With separation imminent, Mrs. Tennyson wrote in 1829 to her father-in-law that Dr. Tennyson had a knife and a loaded gun in his room and that "with the knife he said he would kill Frederick by stabbing him in the jugular vein and in the heart."16 All the sons were in some morbid state or another. The family experienced growing financial problems upon Dr. Tennyson's death in 1831. Tennyson left Cambridge without a degree, published his volume of 1833, and found his poetic reputa- tion ruined by the criticism of Croker and Bulwer. To add to his general nervous state and his fears of going blind, he heard on October 1 of the death of the brilliant Hallam, his closest friend, his brother-in-law to be, and hero extraordinary, as everyone who knew him testified. Such cumulative historical and personal stresses, particularly in a typological mode of thought where parallelisms supply meaning, bring change to a philosophy of history: both to the ideas and the emotional gimbals in which they are fixed. To Tennyson's mind, the transcendent was suffering a fearsome metamorphosis, the historical cycle a deformation, and the hero a morbid obsolescence where he is useless in the pattern. The Liberal Anglicans had given considera- ble thought to the role of the hero-class in bringing about a normal cycle. In Volume I of his Thucydides (1830), Thomas Arnold said: "The guilt of all aristocracies has consisted not so much in their original acquisition of power as in their perseverance in retaining it: so that what was innocent or even reasonable at the beginning has become in later times atrocious injustice; as if a parent in his dotage should claim the same authority over his son in the vigour of Henry Kozicki 95</page><page sequence="9">manhood, which formerly in the maturity of his own faculties he had exercised naturally and profitably over the infancy of his child" (p. 23). Such ineptitude in the political "&lt;parent" - with all the over- tones of the family parent- is Tennyson's concern in "Hail Briton!" for example: that "in the land diseases grew / From want of motion w7hich is meet, / And power that still should change and fleet / Had festered in the hands of few" (29-32). If England late in the heroic stage exercises repression over political children grown to manhood, instead of' instructing and investing them with power,'7 then this malformation of the cycle could well be bodied forth poetically as historical convulsion and disturbed old men - symbols of the dotage Arnold mentions - lingering at a hinge of history into times no longer their own. Furthermore, the transcendent rupture that is its heavenly counterpart could well be suggested by malevolent anthropomorphic shapes with which the hero in closing suffers malformation in turn. In four poems that Tennyson wrote soon after Hallam's death - "Morte d'Arthur," "Ulysses," "Tithon," and "Tiresias" an histor- ical criticism stressing philosophy of history cannot fail to note the presence not only of a distancing legendary matter and the am- 1)iguities of the dramatic mode, but an aged, heroic protagonist closing with or looking for death in a providential universe involving grievous historical change. Divinity is bodied forth in anthropomor- phic symibols indifferent or even malevolent to the hero. The histori- cal situation is characterized by radical change in which the hero is blighted, disturbed, and obsolete. "Ulysses"' contains variants on these themes that anticipate many later poems. From such a view, these four poems are not primarily about a grieving egocentricity at all but involve commentary on the historical significance of Hallam's death. Briefly, England's passage from the heroic to the commons phase is going wrong. She is disturbed and "old," heroically speak- ing, with Hallam the last of her typological heroes. Both, therefore, are symbolized in these poems as old, disturbed figures metaphori- cally equivalent to the cyclic malformation. The violent cycle of providential history is a thematic element in all four poems. The familiar circularity of the matter of Britain out of which "Morte d'Arthur" is built, is placed within the same historical sentiment of Tennyson's 1827 volume: "The old order changeth, yielding place to new, / And God fulfils Himself in many way." But there is a deadly deformation of the cycle. The Idylls would later mnake obvious that no commons-commercial phase had ever been reached, that the aristocracy rot morally from within and destroy 96 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="10">themselves in hysterical religiosity, and so rebels and heathen unite to destroy the kingdom in civil war. "Morte d'Arthur" contains the as yet unqualified Malory matter, that Modred is Arthur's son and that in killing each of the other, along with the death of all, a mighty state founders on an inability to reconcile internal differences. In "Tiresias"' the deformed cycle is decorously in the Greek matter, where Tiresias, the epitome of helpless heroism, warns that "the tyranny of one / Was prelude to the tyranny of all . . . the tyranny of all / Led backward to the tyranny of one" (seemingly the standard, menacing sequence of the French Revolution: monarchal oppres- sion, revolution, mob-rule, tyranny). The result of such mismanage- ment is the same as in "Morte d' Arthur" and Tennyson's early history poenms: a violent cycle where "civil outbreak. . . Would each waste each, and bring on both the yoke / Of stronger states." Inter- necine struggle and inept transitions of power are implicit in this legendary matter as well: Eteocles, the elder son of Oedipus, breaks a political agreement and illegitimately seizes power; he and Polynices kill each other on the battlefield, all die in the civil war and the invasion, and Thebes itself is destroyed later by the Epigoni. In "Tithon" (that "pendant" of "Ulysses") the themes of historical upheaval are also present in the allusive material. Tithon was a brother to Priam and father of a son dead in the Trojan battles and represents in his immobility aristocracy and Troy dead in history, for as Bryant's New System of Ancient Mythology, in the Tennyson library at Somersby, made clear, Tithonus was just a name for "tower"18 and is thus a synecdoche for Troy or the archetypal city lost to history. The ineffectuality of Tithon is at stark contrast with the cyclic return of Eos on "silver wheels," seemingly a symbol of a divine, recurring animating principle unavailing now to Tithon.19 "Ulysses" is a variant. Implicit in the matter is the destruction of Troy, to prominence over which Ithaca succeeds but as it does so displays a peaceful internal transition to the commercial phase under Telemachus. Those that "hoard, and sleep, and feed" and "pay / Meet adoration" to household gods replace without civil war the heroic phase of Ulyssean battle, travel, "honour," and "work of noble note." We cannot avoid the paradoxical conclusion (apparent in "The Lotos-Eaters" as well) that it was the blessed absence of Ulysses and his heroes that made such a "normal" transition possi- ble. As a complement to the historical decline, these four poems show the fag end of the union between hero and anthropomorphic trans- cendence. In history on the ascendant, Arthur is united in the Idylls Henry Kozicki 97</page><page sequence="11">with a covey of such figures at the inception of his reign: the supernatural Lady of the Lake and the three Queens, who were, as a Tennyson note of the 1830's says, "three Guineveres" (Memoir, II, 123). With history on the decline, the union is appropriately disas- trous (like the love union of so many Tennyson poems of this time and like the example of his own family). The sorrowing and long-absent Queens receive Arthur dismally into the reservoir of future poten- tials. If the godhead of Arthur is divorced from, but sorrowful over, his fallen agent, that of"Tiresias" is actively inimical in two guises: Ares, whose curse dogs the history of Thebes since Cadmus un- knowingly slew his sacred serpent, and Athene, who blinded Tiresias as he chanced upon her bathing. Both are anthropomorphic aspects of the "more than man / Which rolls the heavens, and lifts and lays the deep, / Yet loves and hates with mortal hates and loves." The great god Ares cries, "I loath / The seed of Cadmus," and Pallas Athene "in anger" blasted Tiresias with "Henceforth be blind." Both can be seen as instances of the arbitrary malevolence roused by historical presumption: Cadmus founded a city with the dragon's teetb; Tiresias was driven by "some strange hope to see the nearer God." Surrogate for both, the sacrifice -f Menoeceus with the malign unknown procures but a temporary respite for Thebes. Tithon's union with god-head is perhaps even more frightful, for he is supinely passive within a divine corrosion: he "lay wooed" and is her "cchoice" (the 1860 word), her "chosen" in a perversion of the Calvinist Elect. He says, "I wither slowly in thine arms." Yet he had once been in love-union with Eos a part of the inception of history, for Tithon refers to "that strange song I heard Apollo sing, / While Ilion like a mist rose into towers," much as Camelot was built by Fairy King and Queens that came "each with harp in hand, / And built it to the music of their harps" (GL, 257-58). But the result of the love union, not only Tithon's but the traditional ones associated with Troy - Zeus and Leda, Paris and Helen - is for Tithon and Troy disastrous. Ulysses again is a variant: he is apart from Penelope, as Arthur front Guinevere, but it is noteworthy that the dissolution of their union brings no disaster to Ithaca save the absence of heroic opportunity. Within a distorted cycle and a corrupted sacred union, then, the four protagonists are suitably broken in some way. At the feet of the Queens, in images that evoke ruined Camelot, "Like a shattered column lay the King . . . his brow / Striped with dark blood. . . his face was white / And colourless ... like the withered moon." Just as Troy was sacked and burned, Tithon is blasted in Eos' fire; in the 98 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="12">poem's adjectives he is withered, cold now his wrinkled feet, and in the 1860 version "Ashes, marred, wasted, maimed." Tiresias is ancient and blind. Ulysses is the physical exception, as if reflecting in his strength, though old, Ithaca successfully passing through change. Further, the spiritual condition of each hero corresponds to his physical one. Arthur is defeated and numbly resigned in the debacle, "Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed." He asks Bedivere to "Pray for my soul," wonders "if indeed I go - / (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) / To the island-valley of Avilion," and hopes only "that which I have done / May He within Himself make pure." Tithon despairs and longs for "the ground ... my grave." Tiresias too says, "I would that I were gathered to my rest." Ulysses is bitter, resentful, and, as has often been observed, suicidal. "Ulysses" has resulted in disparate critical judgments, ranging from an admiration for the protagonist's heroic aspiration to a con- demnation of his suicidal morbidity. From the vantage of an histori- cal criticism, Ulysses' character is unified by the tragic ambiguities attending obsolescence in history. Ulysses is contemptuous of the ignoble competition of coarse shopkeepers but does not convulse the kingdom in civil war trying to retain authority over a phase of history not his own. It is Telemachus who will fulfill the duty of an aristocrat in time of transition, "by slow prudence to make mild / A rugged people, and through soft degrees / Subdue them to the useful and the good."20 Ulysses realizes himself an anachronism, a Titan no longer required in history, and departs from the resolution of his heroic nature at a Jaspersian "limit": "Beyond the utmost bound of human thought."21 The allusions in the poem are recognized as relating the Ulyssean character to Hamlet, the Ulysses of Troilus and Cressida, and Byron's Napoleon - all restless Faustian men who aspire greatly. Judgment is finally baffled by both gratitude and regret in the effort to reconcile commercial decencies and the heroic conquests on which they rest. We can admire the protagonists in all four poems for their extraor- dinary will in reaching for this limit and lifting history with it, but Tennyson indicates that they are not without culpability in doing so. Ulysses' inordinate aspiration is Christian pride, Greek hubris, and that exacerbating "excitement" condemned by so many thinkers in the nineteenth century. Tithon says he was cursed by his desire "To vary from his kind, or beat the roads / Of life, beyond the goal of ordinance / Where all should pause, as is most meet for all"'; he withers "at the quiet limit of the world." Tiresias falls into this Faustian company, "wandering all the lands . . . With some strange Henry Kozicki 99</page><page sequence="13">hope to see the nearer God"; Pallas Athene tells him plain: "Thou hast seen too much." Arthur too, it has been suggested,22 exceeds the limits in establishing his kingdom, by imposing such tyrannous bonds on his knights that they could not act as free men - and move into the commi-ions stage. In all four cases, the heroic assertion of limitless will in one age lifts man into historical creativity, but the very excess haunts the generations that follow. These four poems of 1833-34 were a nadir of troubled thought about the interplay of transcendence, historical cycles, and the hero. In the years that followed, certain benign influences exerted them- selves upon Tennyson's ideas. England seemed to be working its way to responsible, representative government. Tennyson and his family recovered of course from the deaths of Dr. Tennyson and Hallam. Tennyson's many brothers and sisters began a series of more-or-less satisfactory alliances and he himself fell in love with Rosa Baring in 1834 and with his future wife Emily in 1836. Mill wrote a favorable review of his work in 1835. The family moved in 1837 to Epping Forest, close to London. Tennyson got to London regularly, joined the Sterling Club, and got to know many promi- nent thinkers and writers of the day. Tennyson also began to read widely, study systematically (history on Monday: Memoir, I, 124), and acquire some reputation as a sage. Tennyson's philosophy of history slowly developed during this so-called Ten Years' Silence. The devastating anthropomorphic shapes on the heights dissolve and a more mysterious divinity sufftuses itself into the historical process. Tennyson's new hero does not unite with this divine anthropomorphism, except collectively. In the 1833-34 poem "Of old sat Freedom on the heights," for example, the goddess (for she "God-like, grasps the triple forks, / And, King- like, wears the crown") stepped "down through town and field / To mingle with the human race." The cycle is shown to be neither a cataclysmic disaster nor a steady growth through all its phases, but a series of chrysalises out of which the bursting forth is often violent: fire-births, in Carlylean language. The dross of private vices burnt off to transmute into public benefits suggests the purging of guilt, to effect which the hero now takes on qualities of redeemer or even scapegoat. The cross he bears is a mercenary society, but his sacrifice reveals the hidden goodness in history. This historical expansion of spirit occurs for society on technologi- cal levels. Hare wrote in Guesses that "whenever any of the great changes ordained by God's Providence, in the destinies of mankind are about to take place, the means requisite for the effecting of those 100 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="14">changes are likewise prepared by the same Providence,' and added that Niebuhr himself "&lt;repeatedly expresses his conviction that the various vicissitudes by which learning has been promoted, are under the control of an overruling Providence" (p. 61). Liberal Anglican ideas of Accommodation and progressive revelation clearly enhance the proposition. It is within such a religious context that we must understand Tennyson's many poems of praise for the mechanical wonders of the age and the labor that brings them forth, such as "Mechanophilus" of 1833: "A thousand things are hidden still / And not a hundred known ... Meanwhile, my brothers, work, and wield / The forces of today, / And plow the Present like a field" - laborers in the vineyard. In "Locksley Hall," that "one increasing purpose" that runs through the ages (Jowett once said that Hegel's Philosophy of History is just this line "buried under a heap of categories," Memoir, I, 425), with which the hero (call him Locksley) would close, is this collective expansion of spirit: "Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new: / That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do." This admiration for mechanical discovery is like the Calvinist proof of salvation through history, the providential dispensations by which the heroic workers intuit the transcendent pattern. As Hare said, it behooves "us to deem of inventions, as instruments ordained for us, by the help of which we are to fulfill God's manifold purposes with regard to the destinies of mankind" (Guesses, p. 63). Locksley certainly identifies with the "standards of the peoples" and unites with their objectives rather than the "Guinevere" of the piece, the Amy who weds her golden suitor. Locksley is apart from any goddess, in fact, like the image of Orion forever asunder from the weeping Pleiades with which the poem opens. But if Locksley embraces that linearly increasing purpose, it is on a plane of catastrophic violence. He longs "9to perish, falling on the foeman's ground," his wondrous vision of the world includes air warfare complete with "a ghastly dew/ From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue," and his last pronouncement is a wish for a thunderbolt on Locksley Hall. This fusion between the convul- sive cycle and a linear progression grows out of Tennyson's exten- sive studies in the period 1833-38. As Killham observes, Tennyson read Southey on the Saint-Simonians, Smith on Tiedemann's dis- coveries in biology, Lyell's Principles of Geology, and "was not unwilling to keep in his mind three mutually exclusive theories - the cataclysmic, the uniformitarian (Lyell's) and the quasi-evolutionary."23 Given Tennyson's disdain for the deter- Henry Kozicki 101</page><page sequence="15">minism of the Saint-Simonians, it may be doubted that Tiedemann's discoveries about the human brain developing organically through lower stages would persuade Tennyson of any inevitability in his- tory. On the other hand, the cataclysmic explanation (Christian orthodoxy that species are the result of successive creations after a series of cataclysms) and Lyell's (that the apparent "development" of species was due to the gradual elimination of some by the struggle for existence after a simultaneous creation) both suggest that major developments come about through upheavals and catastrophes in history. This progression through radical but related stages was a natural cast of Tennyson's mind, suggesting itself often by the image of the dragon-fly emerging from a discarded chrysalis. It was used in "Timbuctoo' to suggest the rise of thought to prophetic utterance and in "The Two Voices" for the process by which "Nature through five cycles ran, / And in the sixth she moulded man." Ricks observes that the image was a traditional emblem for the renewal of life and was referred to in Bryant's New System of Ancient Mythology (at Somersby).24 Society at any stage, then, is a chrysalis holding the seed for higher forms, to be superseded and discarded convulsively at the propitious moment. Tennyson's close friendship with him may suggest how congenial to him were Carlyle's ideas in Sartor Resartus about society advancing in a series of palingenetic, phoenix-like stages of death and rebirth: the "fire-creation" that destroys an "old sick Society . . . in the faith that she is a Phoenix; and that a new heavenborn young one will rise out of her ashes!" (III.5).25 The phoenix and the dragon-fly are birds of a feather. Tennyson's "Semele," printed by his son as an 1835 fragment (although Ricks indicates it is found in a notebook with poems of 1833), may be a first fruit of Carlyle's influence (Sartor appeared in 1833-34). Semele out of a presumptuous desire to see the nearer god (like Tiresias) feels "The blast of Godhead," yet hails Dionysius: "son, who shalt be born / When I am ashes, to delight the world." She foresees the Dionysian energy "Moving on to victory," presaging perhaps the "I have felt" of In Memoriam, the victory of feeling over Apollonian knowledge, earthbound wisdom over Promethean aspiration.26 Through these years, many Tennyson poems suggest the fire-birth of new historical forms. In the 1833-34 "Love thou thy land" this animating principle of a phoenix (or a recurring Arthur) hovers over a political death- birth: "now we hear with inward strife / A motion toiling in the gloom - / The Spirit of the years to come / Yearning to mix himself 102 Tennyson's Poetry to the 1842 Poems</page><page sequence="16">with Life": "Phantoms of other forms of rule, / New Majesties of mighty States." The fire-birth as a desideratum may be seen in Locksley's ideal dying place where "the ranks are rolled in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound," in the airy battleground of the future Armageddon as "the heavens fill with shouting," in the "thunder-storm" through which the standards of the peoples rush, and in the final visitation on the symbolic Locksley Hall: "Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt, / Cram- ming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt." Locksley urges this cataclysm in the faith that new forms will replace the dead society of "social wants . . . social lies . . . sickly forms . .. gold." Somehow this will occur as the inventors and workers continue to build for a future where, be it noted, commerce is not excluded, for in that vision, "heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails, / Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bails." Not commerce but the ignoble use of commerce is what must be burned away, just as Carlyle recognized a Plugson purged of Mammonism as the Messiah of the day: "England's hope at present" (Past and Present, III, 12). Goodness will arise from the chrysalis. In contradistinction, such destructiveness was for the earlier Camelot complete and hopeless, nor was there a future for Timbuctoo, Tithon's Troy, Tiresias' Thebes, or Hanno's Carthage. The death of Locksley Hall, however, is symbolic, a vicarious and sacrificial death for a society that, while now sordid and soiled, will live in future virtue. Locksley himself symbolized, just as previous heroes did, the national spirit. Locksley is in 1837-38 a stage in a declension between Ulysses and the hero of Maud (1855). The latter is flawed by the primal commercial curse, is suitably broken as a victim-sacrifice to it, entombed in a madhouse cell beneath the earth, emerges as Christ arisen, and departs as an agent of the providential history: "I am one with my kind, / I embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assigned." Since Locksley has, at this stage of Tennyson's develop- ment, neither the clear Christian purpose of the latter nor the existential purpose of the former, he experiences the "damned vacillating state" of the dialectic of these two voices. One is a life-giving Dionysian energy in Christianity, that "one increasing purpose" of a wondrous age, even if it requires the rite of consumma- tion in the fire-birth of new forms. The other is a death-giving series of self-centered concerns about the loss of love, the inferiority of women, a permanently festering social order, and the determinism of "the individual withers, and the world is more and more." The Henry Kozicki 103</page><page sequence="17">worst temptation is to withdraw from true progress into nature's ordinary providence where, like Ulysses and the mariners in "The Lotos-Eaters,," he will live gloriously in the "Paradise" of savagery. This he rejects for Christian purpose: "I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child. . . Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay." Hare in Guesses pointed to China immobilized in time, where providential "means and instruments" may "lie dor- mant and ineffective for centuries" (p. 61), and Thomas Arnold in Thucydides spoke of nations that never make the transition to manhood but go on "'in protracted infancy" (p. 27). Locksley resolves the dialectic and becomes Hare's Christian Soldier: "Be ye perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect. This is the angel-trumpet which summons man to the warfare of Duty" (Guesses, p. 348). Tennyson's philosophy of history is essentially a Christian one that fearlessly incorporates all ideas available to him. Much of it is subtle and complex and can reasonably be called modern, of interest in itself as well as a way into his poetry. We tend to forget in the press of scientific invention, worldwide military commitment, and politi- cal exacerbation what religious ideas surround such secular events as a new "vehicle" (read railroad or space), a war against a "godless" foe (read Crimea or Vietnam), and reform (read 1832 or 1975). Much of Tennyson's poetry reflects his historical thinking, including many poems that are almost automatically approached today from the standpoint of psychological criticism. A criticism based on philosophy of history often shows, I think, unexpected depths in poems grown too familiar. The University of Wisconsin-Parkside 1 Quoted by W. D.

Tennyson's "of' suggests historical suffering. 4 Jerome Hamilton Buckley, Tennylsotn: The Growth of a Poet (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), p. 28. 5 Francis M.

Vico was well known in the period. See the references to Vico in Forbes. In 1831, Hare and Thirlwall founded the short-lived journal The Philological Museum which in 1833 printed a long article by John Kendrick on Vico characterized as "the best exposition and criticism of Vico's doctrines in English prior to Flint's book in 1884" by Max Harold Fisch and Thonlas Goddard Bergin, "Introduction," The Autobiography of Giambattista Vico (Ithaca, New York, 1944), p. 87. Julius Charles and Augustus William Hare, Guesses at Truth by Two Brothers (London, 1897), p. 347; this influential miscellany was first published in 1827, revised and enlarged in 1838, and new material added in the Second Series in 1848. That both Hare and Thirlwall were examiners for the contest could not have hurt Tennyson's chances, for both the prize and being elected to the Apostles in May of 1829. 12 BuLckley for example in Growth of a Poet, p. 28, mentions without qualification "the Apostles' regard for the Coleridgean view of human history as an organic process"; Clyde de L. Ryals, From the Great Deep (Athens, Ohio, 1967), pp. 102-03, says that "Tennyson seems to have fully assimilated the nineteenth-century doctrine regarding history as an organic growth arranging itself in epochs and repeating itself in cycles. In this view society is regarded as organic, and, like other organisms, is subject to decay." 13 The New Science of Giambattista Vico, trans.

Grote started writing his history in 1823 and the volumes were published 1846-56. 15 Christopher Ricks, Tennyson (New York, 1972), p. 31, says that "it would be easy to exaggerate the intellectual and spiritual influence which the Apostles had upon Tennyson. . . Tennyson's participation in the group was to be genially torpid," but at least grants that what the Apostles "discussed was important," which is far more perceptive than the assessment by Mary Joan Donahue, "Tennyson's Hail Briton! and Tithon in the Heath Manuscript," PMLA, 64 (1949), 399: "His opportunity to understand England's political and economic state had been limited at college." 16 Quoted by Ricks, Tennyson, p. 23. 17 In 1847 Tennyson was reported to have said that one of the great social questions impending in England was "the housing and education of the poor man before making him our master" (Memoir, I, 249). 18 Tithonus "was nothing more than one of these structures, a Pharos, sacred to the sun, as the name plainly shows." Quoted by Ricks, The Poems of Tennyson, p. 564. 19 Cf Arthur as transmigrating Great Father and Nous, or Intellectual Spirit, as understood in the period; see Paden, pp. 78-88. 20 It certainly appears as if Telemachus is left behind to struggle with life and go forward into a new age, which puts a different slant on the two celebrated but ambiguous statements that are always cited in criticism of "Ulysses"; "Ulysses" was "written soon after Arthur Hallam's death, and gave my feelings about the need of going forward, and braving the struggle of life perhaps more simply than anything in 'In Memoriam"' (Memoir, I, 196); Tennyson's other statement includes the assertion that "Ulysses" "was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by bhut that still life must be fought out to the end," James Kifowles, "Aspects of Tennyson, II," Nineteenth Century, 33 (1893), 182. The statements do not confute that Tennyson may have been vaguely thinking of himself as Telemachus left behind; after all, he is always so cast as Bedivere in "Morte d'Arthur." 21 See Karl Jaspers, Tragedy Is Not Enough (Boston, 1952), for various references to Henry Kozicki 105</page><page sequence="19">the Grenz~sitation wherein the existential hero realizes "his selfhood even unto death" (p. 42): the acting out of his personality at the limit for redemption and deliverance. The Tennyson notebooks at Trinity College show the idea as an inter- change of lines and sentiments among the four poems in early drafts, and suggest the identity of the four protagonists in Tennyson's mind. Thus the line "Beyond the utmost lbound of human thought," so familiar in "Ulysses," appears in an alternate draft (watermarked 1832) of "Tiresias": I wish I were as in the days of old, Ere my smooth cheek darkened with youthful down, While yet the blessed daylight made itself Ruddy within the eaves of sight, before I looked upon divinity unveiled And wisdom naked - when my mind was set To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. In another notebook, the essential idea is attributed to Arthur and evokes the "all experience is an arch" passage of "Ulysses": Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere 'Well said old Merlin ere his time was come' "Experience never closes all-in-all But there is always something to be learned Even in the gate of death."

Grateful acknowledgement is also made to a Grant-In-Aid front the American Council of Learned Societies and to a grant from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, that allowed study at Cambridge and at the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln, England.) 22 Ryals argues that "in terms of moral considerations Arthur must meet with destruction; he is guilty of violation of the freedom of others, and like any perpetrator of violence he must pay for his misdeed," but, he adds, "This is the 'Apollonian' judgment upon him. Yet in terms of the 'Dionysiac' point of view he is to be applauded as the highest manifestation of the eternal will, the will of the Absolute Self. ..
