<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT TORONE, 1988 * Alexander Cambitoglou and John K. Papadopoulos INTRODUCTION Excavations at Torone in Chalkidike were continued in 1988 as a collaboration of the Athens Archaeological Society and the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens under the direction of Alexander Cambitoglou.1 The work of the 1988 campaign was again concentrated on Promontory 1, known from Thucydides as the Lekythos2 (fig. 1) and was a continuation of the project begun in 1986.3 In addition to TR 61-9, TR 70-2 were also pegged out (fig. 2). On account of architectural remains visible above ground prior to excavation, or in order to explore more fully features only partially exposed in 1986, the following amendments to the 1986 layout of the trenches were made. (a) The part of the area dug in 1986 as TR 61 and the part of TR 62 confined to the interior of the semicircular building at the SE of the excavation area were called TR 61/2.4 (b) TR 63 was laid out, but not dug, in 1986 as a 5.0 χ 4.5m rectangle with 1.0m wide baulks between it and TR 61 on the one hand and TRgi&gt;5 on the other. In 1988, because of the risk of causing damage to the large semicircular building, it wasv decided to widen the SE baulk and eliminate the NW baulk. In addition, the trench was enlarged by the incorporation of the SE part of TR 65. (c) The baulk between TR 67 and 68 was eliminated in 1988 so that the measurements of TR 68 increased to 7.0 χ 6.0m. Note also that of the trenches originally sited in 1986 TR 64 (not indicated in fig. 2) and TR 66 have not been dug until now. * The expedition to Torone is generously financed by the Australian Research Council, the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens and the Association for Classical Archaeology of the University of Sydney. The authors also wish to thank for their assistance the Council of the Athens Archaeological Society and the Section of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Science. More particularly they express their gratitude to Dr George Dontas, Dr Basil Petrakos, Dr Yiannis Tzedakis, and Dr Ioulia Vokotopoulou. AC is especially grateful for assistance to the German Archaeological Institute (Zentrale), which enabled him to work on this report in Berlin during the period 8 January to 9 February 1990.

Papadopoulos The new trenches pegged out in 1988 were sited in line 1.7m to the NW of TR 67, separated from each other by 1.0m wide baulks (fig. 2). TR 70 measured 5.0 χ 4.0m, while TR 71 and 72 were 5.0m squares. Of these only TR 72 was dug. Work in 1988 concentrated on TR 61/2, 63, 68, and 72; excavation also continued in the S quarter of The aims of the 1988 campaign were as follows: (1) To investigate more fully the large semicircular structure partially exposed in 1986 at the SE end of the excavation area and the structure represented by Wall 6 in the 1986 TR 65, thought to be perhaps a cistern.5 (2) To explore further, with the excavation of TR 68, the area partly exposed in the Ε quarter of TR 67 in 1986, where an important stratigraphical sequence from the EBA to the post-Byzantine period was incompletely revealed.6 (3) To extend the area under investigation toward the NW by digging in TR 72. The method of excavation and the treatment of the small finds are those briefly described in the 1986 report.7 Lekythos Datum Point 1 (14.08m above sea level; fig. 2) was again used as the absolute datum.

All excavated units were either selectively or totally dry-sieved using a 'shaker sieve' supplemented by the use of finer hand sieves. The 'shaker-sieve', designed by Dr S. Diamant, was borrowed from the American School excavations at the Athenian Agora. It is similar to that illustrated in S. Diamant, JFieldA 6, 1979, 208 fig. 5. In the case of certain excavation units such as topsoil, disturbed strata, or deposits of structural fill, only one in every four rubber buckets was sieved, while with some units, for instance the fill of pits, all</page><page sequence="3">Excavations at Torone, 1988 95 0 ofLTLTLJ I [25m Fig. 2. The Lekythos (Promontory 1 ). Plan of the layout of the trenches and of some architectural remains visible above ground level. As was the case in 1986, the trenchçs opened in 1988 tended to produce complementary rather than similar results and highlighted the complex, multi-phase character of the site. The Lekythos appears to have been more or less continuously occupied from the EBA to the post-Byzantine era, with breaks in occupation perhaps only during the Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman periods and again during the Early Byzantine period.8 A natural result of this long occupation of the promontory were several major structural changes, mostly during the Classical and Hellenistic periods and the Late Byzantine and post-Byzantine periods. The continuous opening of foundation trenches and rubbish pits, coupled with stone robbing of earlier structures, involved considerable displacement of datable material. Therefore, many small finds were found out of original context.9 excavated earth was sieved. It is worth noting that dry-sieving was effective in recovering much organic material, particularly from the fill of some of the post-Byzantine rubbish pits which contained fish scales, small pieces of eggshell, as well as minuscule fragments of sea shell, charcoal, bone, and other substances. 8 Rep. 1986, 213-4. g Our excavation produced some excellent illustrations of the. rule according to which the later the layer, the more likely it is to contain earlier material (see G.

Papadopoulos One of the targets of the 1988 campaign was to survey Hill 1 locally known as 'Vigla'.10 A new grid was established by A. Sprent of the University of Tasmania, making it consistent with that established in 1981 for the lower part of the site by the late John Harwin. The results of this work will be presented in due course elsewhere.11 It should be mentioned here, however, that an important result of this endeavour was the location of the very poorly preserved continuation of Wall N1 (fig. 1),which had been previously overlooked and has now been shown to extend to the S and to join one of the towers on the Ε side of the Vigla Β complex.12 10 A.

None of the trenches opened was completely dug at the end of the season. TR 61/2 (Figs. 3-12; Pis. 30:1-31:7) In 1986 the interior of the large semicircular structure was divided into two parts on a SE/NW axis and the southern one was excavated to a depth of just over 3.5m. In 1988 excavation continued in the NW part as defined by the internal faces of Walls A and Β (figs. 3-4),13 proceeding through ten phases from post-Byzantine to Classical. Since, by the end of the campaign, the interior of the semicircular structure had been entirely dug and three clearly distinguished Classical phases excavated below the original floor level of the structure, it is now possible to describe these phases in stratigraphie order beginning with the Classical phases 10, 9, and 8 and continuing through to phase 1 (the late post-Byzantine phase). The deeper, pre-Classical deposits in the northern sector were not excavated in 1988. The equivalent deposits in the southern sector were partially explored in 1986, but excavation there was not continued in 1988, so that the large pithos discovered in an upright position in situ and thought to be of EIA date is not yet removed.14 In the following account the term phase denotes a group of excavation units which are clearly associated. Each individual stratigraphie entity, layer, floor, pit fill, etc. is described by unit number; each unit may have been dug using one or more rubber buckets.1 Fig. 4. TR 61/2.

Papadopoulos Phase 10 comprises a series of walls, labelled Walls G(i), G(ii), H, and I (figs. 4, 6; pi. 30: 1-3), which divide the excavated area into several architectural units. Wall G(i), oriented SE/NW, has a preserved length of 3.40m, a 1.75m long stretch of which lies below Wall D(ii) (fig. 6; pi. 30: 4). To the NW it had been cut by the foundation trench for Wall Β of the semicircular structure, as had the overlying Wall D(ii) (fig. 6). Wall G(ii), oriented NE/SW, is bonded at right angles to Wall G(i); it has a preserved length of c.2.00m and was cut, to the NE, by the foundation trench for Wall A. Walls G(i) and G(ii) survive up to a maximum height of 0.35m, first encountered at a depth of c.2.90m bd; their average width is 0.48m. They have regular, even faces on both sides composed of small and medium-size stones, mostly quite thin (0.04-0.08m), laid flat. Both walls were constructed of either undressed or only roughly hewn stones, bonded with mud. An admixture of limestone, schist, and granodiorite, all quarried locally,16 was employed, with limestone slabs predominating for the wall faces and smaller pieces of schist for the core of the walls. Wall H, oriented SE/NW, has a preserved length of only 0.62m. To the NW it abuts the SE face of the corner of Walls G(i) and G(ii), while to the SE it too had been cut by the foundation trench for Wall A. Wall H survives up to three courses to a maximum height of 0.20m. It has a width of 0.40m and is of construction similar to that of Walls G(i) and G(ii). Wall I lies almost directly under Wall D(i). As far as can be ascertained, it has a preserved length of over 2.40m, oriented SW/NE and appears to abut Wall G(i) to the NE. To the SW it was presumably cut by the foundation trench for Wall A. It survives to a height of 0.20m, mostly one to two courses, with an approximate width of 0.45m. Its NW face is visible in a 2.40m stretch; its SE face is only a 0.30m stretch (fig. 4; pi. 30: 5). Walls G(i), G(ii), H, and I divide TR 61/2 into four areas designated for convenience as the north, south, east, and west sectors. Floor surfaces associated with Phase 10 were located in three of these sectors. These floors, exposed but not dug, represent the limit of excavation by the end of the 1988 campaign (pi. 30: 1-3). The floor in the north sector is composed of compacted brown, sandy soil with a smooth, fairly level surface; its dimensions are approximately 2.80 (N/S) χ 3.90m (E/W).17 It runs up to Walls G(i) and G(ii) to the SE and SW, but was cut away to the NW and NE by the foundation trenches for Walls A and B, and to the Ν by a deeper pit. The floor lies at a depth of about 3.26m bd. The floor exposed in the south sector is of similar composition but somewhat more compacted and contains some fine pebbles in its make-up. Its surface runs up toward the NE as far as the SW face of Wall H and toward the NW as far as Wall I. Toward the Ν it runs up to and slightly over the stones labelled Feature 2 (fig. 4; pi. 30: 2). The SW continuation of this surface was excavated in 1986;18 the floor is illustrated in section on fig. 7B as are the underlying deposits also excavated in 1986. That this floor is associated with Feature 2 seems fairly clear. The feature itself consists of four medium to large stones laid flat and set in line against the SW face of Wall G(i). The tops of the stones present an even and level surface, which may have been the base of an architectural fitting, possibly a bench.19 The floor in the west sector, labelled unit 57, was composed of moderately compacted earth containing fine pebbles; it covered an area 0.85 (E/W) χ 0.90m (N/S). It is clearly associated with Wall G(i) and lies directly below unit 56 of Phase 8 (fig. 5). In the east sector no trace of floor surface was noticed, although it should be noted that the area exposed here was very small and much disturbed by the foundation trench for Wall A of the semicircular structure. Establishing the precise date of Phase 10 within the course of the Classical period might only be possible by excavating the make-up of the floors described above and examining the underlying deposits, especially in the larger area of the north sector. It is worth noting, however, that a preliminary study of the material from the overlying Phase 9 seems to suggest that the greater part of the inventoried pottery and other small finds are best dated to the later 5th rather than 4th cent. BC. One is, therefore, tempted to tentatively place Phase 10 within the course of the 2nd half of the 5th cent. BC and to speculate that Walls G(i), G(ii), H, and I, along with their associated floors, may be remains of the houses described by Thucydides in his account of the battle fought between the Athenians and Spartans at Torone in 424/3 BC. 16 Torone lies near the edge of a natural division between volcanic rocks and metamorphic formations (sipolines, schists, phyllites, gneisses). See, for instances, the geological map of Greece in R. E. Jones, Greek and Cypriot Pottery. A Review of Scientific Studies (1986) 104 fig. 3: la. 17 On fig. 5 the surface of this floor is designated as unit 52. 18 Rep. 1986, 194-5. In 1986 only unclear trace» of this surface were noted in Trench 61. 19 Feature 2 might be associated with a large, well-dressed granodiorite block (measuring approx imately 1.06 χ 0.38m) encountered in units 48 and SO more or less overlying Feature 2. 20 IV 113, 115.</page><page sequence="7">Excavations at Torone, 1988 99 Fig. 5. TR 61/2. Reconstructed SW/NE section.</page><page sequence="8">100 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Phase 9 represents the disuse or demolition and subsequent in-filling of Phase 10 with the purpose of creating a level for the construction of Phase 8. Phase 9 consists of a series of earth, stone rubble, and tile dumps. These were excavated as units 47-50,53, and 55 which represented both real and arbitrary divisions of the fill. The distinction between units 48 and 49, for instance, was arbitrary, while the essential difference between them on the one hand and unit 50 on the other was a slightly greater quantity of stone in the latter. Unit 47 (fig. 5) lay partly on top of units 48-9 and 50 and unlike them contained a good quantity of dark grey ash, fine in texture, with flecks of charcoal throughout. Units 53 and 55 were the dumps in the eastern sector; unit 55 contained copious quantities of roof tiles and sherds, whereas the overlying unit 53 consisted mainly of earth. In this sector, the levelling dumps, especially unit 55, sloped steeply from W to Ε following the natural gradient of the land. As noted above, these dumps produced a good quantity of fragmentary pottery and other small finds, which seem to date to the later 5th cent. BC.21 Phase 8 represents a later period of Classical construction and, in part, a rebuilding or remodelling of some of the walls of Phase 10. Walls D(i) and D(ii), bonded at right angles and forming the eastern corner of a, presumably, domestic structure extending to the Ν and W, belong to Phase 8. Wall D(i) was built over Wall I (pi. 30: 5), and Wall D(ii) was built over the NW portion of Wall G(i) (pi. 30: 4). The SE part of Wall G(i), along with Walls G(ii) and H were now out of use. Wall D(i) is oriented SW/NE and has a preserved length of about 3.00m; its SW part, which was excavated in 1986, had been cut by the foundation trench for Wall A. Wall D(ii), oriented SE/NW, is preserved for a length of 1.70m; to the NW it was cut by the foundation trench for Wall B. Walls D(i) and D(ii) survive to a maximum preserved height of 0.25m. They have regular faces on both sides and have a width of 0.44-0.48m. Like the walls of Phase 10, Walls D(i) and D(ii) were constructed of small to medium-size stones, mostly laid flat, bonded with mud. An admixture of limestone, schist, and granodiorite was employed, with limestone predominating for the faces and smaller pieces of schist for the core of the walls. Walls D(i) and D(ii) divide the excavated area into two sectors: one to the W, defined by the inner corner of the two walls, and the other beyond, to the Ν, E, and ESE. In both sectors two successive floor surfaces were met. In the larger sector to the Ν and east, the primary floor was labelled unit 45. This was a rough, and in places patchy, surface covering an area approximately 2.00 (N/S) χ 2.20m (E/W) consisting of roof-tile fragments, sherds, small stones, and pebbles set in a matrix of clay. Lying over this was a thin layer of trampled debris, designated unit 44. Above this, in turn, a more carefully laid surface was exposed, which was designated unit 41 (figs. 5, 8; pi. 30: 6); it consisted of a paving of small stones, sherds, and roof-tile fragments,22 and could well be external. To the NE and NW this surface had been cut away by the foundation trenches for Walls A and B. In the smaller west sector the stratigraphy was similar. Unit 46 represents the primary floor which resembled unit 45 (the lower part of its make-up had been cleared as unit 56); unit 43 represents the trampled debris lying over it (corresponding to unit 44), while unit 42 was a carefully paved surface of stones, sherds, and roof-tile fragments similar to unit 41, although containing a greater quantity of stones. It would appear that the surface unit 42 extended to the SE, where a scatter of stones and roof-tile fragments was exposed in 1986, although here a certain amount of disturbance had been caused by Burial 1, thought to be Late Roman.23 The surfaces designated units 41 and 42 were encountered at a depth of 2.80-2.90m bd. The dating of the construction of Walls D(i) and D(ii) and of the period of use of the building must await the close study of the pottery and the other small finds recovered from the successive floor surfaces. It may be noted at this stage that a good quantity of Classical sherds and other small finds was obtained from the units of Phase 8, along with some earlier material, including PG and BA material. Much of the Classical pottery, especially the red-figure and black-glaze fragments, should date to the 5th cent. BC, but the presence of at least one black-glaze base fragment in unit 42, bearing rouletted decoration, would suggest that the latest identifiable material belongs to the 4th cent. BC.24 Lying over Phase 8 and extending over the preserved tops of Walls D(i) and D(ii), was a thin deposit, brown to light brown in colour and moderately compact in texture, consisting of earth, sand, and occasional small stones and pebbles. This deposit, designated unit 40 (fig. 5), should have been formed by the disuse and, or, demolition of Phase 8 and, presumably, the levelling and ground clearance for the construction of Phase 7. Most of the pottery recovered from unit 40 was Classical, with the latest identifiable fragments certainly dating to the 4th cent. BC. A few scraps of BA pottery were also noted in this unit, as well as some fragments of Byzantine or post-Byzantine date. Unit 40 also yielded the only coin to be discovered 21 Such as inv. 88.214, » white ground, ivy patterned lekythos from unit 48; inv. 88.247, a red figure calyx krater fr. from unit 50. 22 The proportion of small stones to sherds and tile fragments was 65:35. 23 Rep. 1986, 194. 24 For the inception of rouletting, «ee B.

Cambiîoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Phase 7 is that of the construction of the semicircular structure, a large defensive tower forming part of the post-Classical defensive system of Promontory 1 (see below). The following description is confined to Walls A and Β and indeed to the interior of the structure, since its exterior has not been investigated as yet (fig. 4; pis. 30: 7; 31: 1). Wall Β is oriented SW/NE; its SE face within the structure has been fully exposed and has a length of 6.94m. The wall continues, however, to the SW and NE, beyond its junctions with Wall A, and should, therefore, be part of the larger Byzantine or post-Byzantine fortification system (fig. 3). The semicircular Wall A projects outwards to the SE to a maximum radius of 5.60m from the SE face of Wall B. Walls A and Β are bonded. 0 οΠΠΠ llM Fig. 8. TR 61/2. Plan of floor surfaces associated with Walls D(i) and (ii). Both walls are constructed on top of fairly substantial foundations. The line between the wall foundations, the faces of which were not plastered, and the walls proper, which were, should approximately correspond to the ground level at the time of construction (pis. 30: 7; 31: 1, 4). The foundations have the same width as the walls proper above them, but at certain points they are up to 0.12m wider. The foundations were sunk below the construction ground level by at least 0.60-0.80m. The foundation trenches were only slightly wider than the walls, since the distance of their faces from the wall foundations varies from 0.03 to 0.04m. A small constructional backfill (unit 37) was recovered from the space between the wall foundations and the trench faces. This fill yielded many fragments of Classical pottery—the latest belonging to the earlier 4th cent. BC—, as well as some fragments of Geometric, PG, and BA date, some 11.42kg of roof-tile fragments, and many pieces of plaster. Two fragments of pottery appear to be of Byzantine or post-Byzantine date, confirming the more recent date of construction. Fig. 8. TR 61/2. Plan of floor surfaces associated with Walls D(i) and (ii).</page><page sequence="11">Excavations at Torone, 1988 103 Walls A and Β do not survive to their original height, having collapsed mostly outwards to the S and E. Wall A survives to a maximum height of 2.90m above construction level; Wall Β to a maximum of 2.20m. The width of Wall A is 1.23-1.33m, that of Wall Β 1.17-1.20m. The stones of the interior faces of the two walls are, in some parts, roughly coursed and in others uncoursed (figs. 9, 10; pi. 31: 4). An admixture of limestone, granodiorite, and schist was used. The limestone blocks tended to be small to medium in size and only roughly dressed on the side visible in the face. Much of the granodiorite was in medium-size slabs cut and reused from larger blocks of the Classical period, while schist was mainly used in smaller pieces filling interstices. A smaller quantity of tiles and sherds was used for the same purpose as schist. One of the stones, located near the base of Wall A, is inscribed with a single letter, a vau or digamma of Archaic form and is probably a mason's mark (fig. 9; pi. 31: 3).25 It is the only inscription of Archaic date on stone discovered so far at Torone by the archaeological expedition. A thick mortar bonding of lime and large-grained sand was used and this was faced between the stones with a lime plaster containing fine-grained sand. As noted in the report on the 1986 campaign, this technique would have originally produced an interesting surface of variously coloured and textured stone contrasting with the white or off-white plaster.26 This plaster facing was not preserved on the uppermost 0.20-0.40m of Wall A, having weathered away where the preserved upper part of the wall was exposed above modern ground level prior to excavation. At the bottom of the wall the mortar lips up over the floor surface at the level at which this was laid (that is the top of units 40 and 37). At one point, below the preserved top of Wall A and at a distance from it varying from 0.20 to 0.60m, the mortar is clearly not original (fig. 9). Here it consists of light grey lime, mixed with fine and coarse sand, roughly applied between and partly over the stones. This remodelling of the internal face of Wall A is presumably associated with the reuse of the semicircular structure during Phase 2 (see below). In addition, a fairly large part of Wall A appears to have been either rebuilt or largely remodelled slightly to the Ν of its centre (fig. 9; pi. 31: 5). This repair, which reaches the preserved top of the wall, covers a portion of its internal face approximately 1.20m wide and 1.50m high. Although limestone and granodiorite blocks were used for it the repaired part differs from the original construction by the greater quantity of schist included in it. The repair also differs by its mortar which in the interstices between stones is not flush with the wall face, as is the case in the original parts, but is recessed by about 0.05m. The repair also includes a granodiorite block which projects from the wall face by 0.11m; its function, if it had any, is not clear. The stratigraphical evidence would suggest that the repair was probably done during the period of the primary use of the semicircular structure, prior to the laying of the Phase 6 fill. Another possibility, which, on the evidence at hand, seems less likely, is that the repair was effected during Phase 4 and is therefore contemporary with the construction of the retaining Walls Ε and F (see below and also fig. 11). Walls A and Β are marked by a number of beam holes (indicated in solid ink on figs. 9 and 10). On Wall Β there are two lines of such holes at two levels. The lower line of three holes (perhaps originally four) is set at a height 0.40-0.60m above construction level, while the higher set of four (perhaps originally five) is 1.68-1.78m above it. Two corresponding lines of beam holes exist in Wall A. The lower line, comprising seven holes, is set at a height of 1.10-1.30m above construction level. The upper line is really a less regular series: it comprises three holes, which are clearly in line, at a height of 1.80-1,90m above construction level (fig. 9, the right end), a fourth at a slightly lower level (at a height of 1.60m) and a fifth at a height 2.25m above construction level. A further, more oblong, hole exists near the centre of the wall, in the part that was remodelled, at a height 2.35m above construction level. 25 The diagonal ban and the long tail would point to an early date. It ii alto interesting to note that the tailless vau was the most commonly used in Euboia and her colonies. A. W. Johnston comments in lilleris: 'It seems that your digamma is an isolated letter on some form of architectural block. In this case, there is every likelihood that it is a form of mason's mark, perhaps numerical, or, better, sequential, i.e. the sixth in a series. To my knowledge the letter is not attested in Euboian contexts except in the Western colonies after c.525, and so it would be hazardous to guess what shape it took; it does look prima facie like a pre-500 or 480 variety to me. The retrograde direction would support such a date; other interpretations (e.g. alpha—a Cretan type) seem highly unlikely. Naturally the date could be well before that terminus.'

Elevation of the internal face of Wall B.</page><page sequence="13">Excavations at Torone, 1988 105 It seems fairly clear that the holes cannot have served for the insertion of beams supporting a single floor spanning the space between Walls A and B, since none of the holes in one wall corresponds to a hole in the other; nor could the holes have held beams projecting to a single common point.27 The holes, moreover, were set at more than one level. They could have served to hold beams supporting the load of a wooden walkway, or, more likely, simple constructional scaffolding.2* The exterior NE face of Wall A had been excavated in 1978 down to below foundation level in a stretch 7.9 about 3.50m long. Elsewhere only surface clearance has been carried out so far except for a stretch of Wall B, about 2.00m long to the SW, to a depth of 1.20m below the surviving wall top and another stretch about 2.00m long along the exterior face of Wall A near its junction with Wall Β on the SW side to a depth of 1.50m. Both of these test cuttings were excavated by the Byzantine Ephoreia prior to the commencement of the current excavations.30 Parts of Walls A and Β which had collapsed were visible in the cuttings of the Byzantine Ephoreia. Interestingly, the visible parts of the exterior face of Wall A, except at the very junction with Wall B, are constructed almost exclusively of larger granodiorite blocks from Classical buildings in secondary use, laid in regular courses with the narrow edges of the blocks visible in the wall face. The exterior face of Wall A near its junctions with Wall Β and the entire exterior face of Wall B, as visible at present, are of identical construction to the interior faces described above. Also associated with Phase 7 is unit 36 (fig. 5), which consists of building material dumped inside the structure, to a maximum depth of 0.12m, directly on top of the ground level, unit 40. Possibly laid during the construction of the semicircular structure, or when part of Wall A was repaired, unit 36 comprises a good quantity of tile fragments together with some sherds, many stones, fine pebbles and sand, as well as dark brown earth. The deposit was rather compact in texture. Towards the centre it was overlain by a lens of fine ash covering an area of c. 1.20 χ 1.20m which contained frequent pieces of charcoal and some animal bones. Unit 36 covered most of the internal area of the semicircular structure, but clearly petered out near the walls. Its rather heavy compactness suggests trampling during the time of construction of the building or that of its repair; the ash and charcoal lens may be the result of a builders' fire. The surfaces of units 36 and 40 are in fact the two floor levels described in the 1986 report. The largest component of the rather small quantity of fragmentary pottery recovered from unit 36 was Classical, although at least one fragment seems to be of Hellenistic date. This same deposit, however, during the 1986 campaign, had yielded a fragmentary glazed open vessel with incised decoration of Late Byzantine, rather than post-Byzantine, date (inv. 86.158).31 Establishing the exact date of construction of the semicircular structure within the wider chronological frame of the Late Byzantine and post-Byzantine periods is at present impossible mainly because of the difficulty of dating the contemporary associated pottery. The problem of dating the structure is made even more difficult by the small quantity of pottery actually recovered from units 36 and 37, the two important deposits for the dating of the structure. Phase 6, which comprises units 14,16,31, and almost certainly 12, is the phase of the filling of the interior of the semicircular structure, to a maximum depth of about 1.30m, after its primary use, by means of three major dumps of mortar, sand, and stone rubble. Unit 31, which was the lowest, was 0.25m thick and was first encountered at a depth of 2.39m bd; it was largely composed of small and medium pieces of lime mortar and equal quantities of sand and small to medium-size stones, mainly limestone; but it contained also some granodiorite and schist. Unit 16, above unit 31, was 0.65m thick and was composed of more or less equal quantities of lime mortar and stone. Unit 14, which overlay 16, was dug to a maximum depth of 0.40m and consisted mainly of lime mortar and a small quantity of sand; it contained almost no stone. Unit 12 is best seen as a unit of Phase 6, being that part of the fill, which had subsequently collapsed, or was intentionally pushed, over the top of the retaining Wall Ε (see below). Units 14,16, and 31 contained moderate quantities of brick and tile fragments, many with adhering mortar. The rather small quantity of pottery recovered belonged to different periods: fragments of prehistoric, Classical, and Late Roman 27 In order to establish the direction of each beam a series of long ranging pole· were slotted into the holes. They revealed that the beams were placed at various angles. 28 Mr. Ioakeim Papangelos of the Byzantine Ephoreia for Chalkidike informs us that such beam holes, used for constructional scaffolding, are common for Byzantine and post-Byzantine towers.

Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos pottery were recorded in varying quantities. The latest identifiable material included coarse and cooking-ware fragments thought to date from the period of the Turkish occupation. A late date for the filling of the semicircular structure was established by the discovery, in 1986, of a post-Byzantine clay tobacco pipe.33 Other small finds include a few stone architectural fragments and several iron nails. It should be noted that unit 31 contained fairly frequent and relatively large fragments of animal bones, along with a quantity of sea shells, suggesting domestic rubbish dumping. This, coupled with the stone rubble, sand and lime mortar, would indicate that the Phase 6 deposits derive from demolition or building debris (perhaps in part deriving from lime-kiln use because of the large quantity of lime mortar), domestic refuse and sand, the latter probably brought in directly from the beach nearby. Phase 5 is the creation of a level for the construction of Walls Ε and F of Phase 4 (figs. 5 and 11). This construction level was achieved by various dumps of earth and stone rubble designated units 27, 29, and 30, which filled in a large cutting labelled Cutting 1. This cutting, which created a large open space about 3.50m long, 2.50m wide, and 1.20-1.40m deep, represents the removal of a good part of the Phase 6 fill and extends to the Ν as far as the junction of Walls A and B, where it caused their partial demolition (fig. 11; cf. figs. 9, 10; pi. 31: 2).34 Immediately following the opening of Cutting 1, a pit was dug within it and through unit 36 designated Cutting 2, at the junction of Walls A and Β (fig. 4; pi. 31: 2). The pit has a length of c.1.70m, a width of c. 1.66m and a depth of c.0.80m. The sharp distinction between the pit itself and its fill, which contained partly lime mortar believed to have derived from the partial removal of Phase 6 dumps, suggests that it was filled soon after it was opened. The fill of the pit consists of three deposits labelled in ascending stratigraphie order units 34, 33, and 32, distinguished by their varying quantities of lime mortar, sand, stones, and earth.35 It is difficult to guess the reasons for which the pit was dug; it may have been opened for the purpose of assessing the depth of the foundations of Walls A and B, or for the purpose of robbing stones from these walls, although the latter possibility seems remote, since both pit (Cutting 2) and the large open space around it (Cutting 1) were found filled with a good many stones originating from the walls. The largest part of the pottery recovered from units 32—4 consisted of Late- or post-Byzantine fragments, although smaller quantities of BA, Classical, and Late Roman sherds were also obtained. The fill as a whole also yielded 33.60kg of tile fragments. Cutting 1 was presumably dug deeper than required and it must have become subsequently necessary to raise the ground level by between 0.30 and 0.70m to create a surface for the walls of Phase 4. This was achieved by the earth and stone dumps designated units 27, 29, and 30 (fig. 5).36 Here too the largest Fig. 11. TR 61/2.

Unit 30 refers to the fill in the part of the cutting immediately above Walls A and B, which consisted exclusively of medium-size stones.</page><page sequence="15">Excavations at Torone, 1988 107 component of the fragmentary pottery recovered was Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine, although small quantities of earlier wares were also noted, in addition to 38.55kg of tile fragments. Finds other than pottery included a fragmentary stone column (pi. 31: 6), measuring 0.76m in length and 0.24—0.28m in diameter, two terracotta loomweights, and three objects of worked bone.

Phase 4 consists of Walls Ε and F (fig. 11) constructed upon the level created by the Phase 5 fill. Walls Ε and F are retaining walls which hold back the mortar and rubble dumps of Phase 6. Wall F was constructed in a shallow foundation trench, which was cut through the top of units 27 and 29; Wall Ε was built directly on top of units 27 and 29. Wall E, oriented SE/NW, has a length of almost 2.90m. To the NW it would have originally abutted Wall B; in the state of preservation in which it was found, a 0.70m stretch of it had totally collapsed near Wall Β (fig. 11). To the SE the wall terminates, clearly forming an angle with Wall F, which abuts onto it. It survives up to five rough courses, to a maximum height of 0.95m (fig. 12B); the width of the wall varies between 0.20 and 0.45m. Wall F, oriented NE/SW, is 1.55m long; it abuts Wall Ε to the SW and Wall A to the NE. It survives up to three irregular courses, to a maximum height of 0.60m (fig. 12C); its width varies between 0.20 and 0.40m.</page><page sequence="16">108 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos As retaining walls, Walls Ε and F have only one face. They are built of roughly hewn limestone with an admixture of granodiorite and are only roughly coursed. The courses were levelled up with smaller stones and a light brown mud bonding. The preserved top of Wall Ε was first encountered at a depth of 1.53m bd. Walls Ε and F and a 3.00m long stretch of Wall A, which was reused during this phase, define a small architectural unit measuring approximately 2.00 (SW/NE) χ 3.00m (SE/NW) in plan, about 0.90m deep. The space created by cutting away part of the junction of Walls A and Β at this level would have served as something of an informal entrance. Excavation failed to reveal a clear floor surface associated with Walls Ε and F and it would appear that the top of the Phase 5 dumps (units 27 and 29) served as a kind of surface. The exact function of this small architectural unit is uncertain and might only be clarified by further excavation to the N, beyond the junction of Walls A and B. Its poor construction and the absence of a real floor suggest that it was perhaps used for the purpose of storage. Phase 3 represents the disuse and subsequent filling in of Phase 4. with the purpose of creating a level for Phase 2. It was made up of the units 21, 20, 13, 22, 18, 19, 17, 15, and 11, which may be described in ascending stratigraphie order as follows. Unit 21 consisted of the collapse of the 0.70m long stretch of Wall Ε discussed above; unit 20 was a localized dump with a maximum thickness of just over 0.20m mostly consisting of stone, but also including sandy earth and tile fragments; units 13 and 22 consisted of that part of the fill used to level up the portions of Walls A and Β that had been cut away.37 Units 18 and 19 (fig. 5) were composed of sand and earth; unit 17, which was considered to be part of units 18 and 19 consisted of a localized concentration of tile and pottery fragments; unit 15 was similar to units 18 and 19 in both composition and texture; finally unit 11 was the uppermost part of the fill and was primarily composed of pebbles and earth as well as a quantity of ash. Collectively, the Phase 3 dumps yielded over 200 sherds of Late- or post-Byzantine date and 156.64kg of tile fragments. A smaller quantity of prehistoric. Classical, and Late Roman sherds was also recovered in addition to the occasional fragment of glass, as well as some animal bone and sea shell. Phase 2 is that of the laying of a solid floor surface on top of the Phase 3 dumps, located towards the NE of the interior of the semicircular structure. This floor covers a 2.10 (E/W) χ 2.00-3.00m (N/S) area and is designated unit 7. It extends, to the E, up to the internal face of Wall A, and, to the SW, up to a series of limestone slabs, laid flat and in line, resembling a paving. This line of slabs, designated Feature 1, is a little strange since it lies directly over the top of Wall Ε and, more or less, beneath the later Wall C (fig. 5 and Rep. 1986, 191 ill. 8); stratigraphically it was separated from the former by units 11 and 12 and from the latter by unit 5. It could be the remains of a wall or some other architectural feature. Towards the S, along the curve of Wall A, there were no traces of the floor unit 7. In its place, in the roughly triangular space defined by Wall A and the imaginary extension of the line of the stones of Feature 1, was a roughly oval informal fireplace, designated unit 8. The fireplace consisted of a central part of light grey, soft-textured ash, which was surrounded by a hard-fired reddish-brown and yellow clay; its measurements were about 1.00 χ 0.60m. Because of erosion and of the modern ground surface which dipped down at this point from S to Ν there weTe no traces left of the floor unit 7 towards the Ν and NW.3® The floor, which had an average thickness of 0.09-0.10m, must have been fully resurfaced on one occasion, or else, it must have been originally laid in two, and perhaps even three, stages. The upper part of its make-up was an orange-brown, heavily compacted, very hard and even surface, which gave way to a light brown-grey part further down. A strange feature of the floor was that it was perforated by thirteen holes of varying diameters and depths. These holes were, more or less, set in line (pi. 31: 7), near to and following the line of Wall A. Mostly circular, or else oval, the larger of these holes had a diameter varying from 0.20 to 0.30m, the smaller ones had a diameter of 0.06-0.08m. Some were filled with a very loosely textured earth which could be spooned out easily, others were filled with small stones. The fill of the holes was cleared as unit 10;39 a few scraps of post-Byzantine pottery were recovered, as well as a musket ball (inv. M88.34). This combination of a hard-packed perforated floor and an area of burning initially suggested to us the possibility of the existence of a kiln; further excavation, however, disproved this theory. Associated with this phase was the partial repair of the internal face of Wall A. As noted above, at a depth varying between 0.20 and 0.60m below the preserved top of Wall A the mortar is clearly not original; it consists of a light grey lime with fine and coarse sand and is rather roughly applied between the stones and partially over them (pi. 31: 4-5). 37 Unit 13 was largely composed of stones, whereas unit 22 included roughly equal quantities of pebbles and sandy earth. 38 The floor unit 7 was similar to a surface excavated in 1986 further to the W and SW, at a slightly higher level; thii surface was associated with Wall C (see Rep. 1986, 192). 39 Each hole, however, was defined alphabetically.</page><page sequence="17">Excavations at Torone, 1988 109 Phase 1 is the most recent phase of the use of the semicircular structure during which the poorly built, dry rubble, Wall C was constructed (fig. 12A). Oriented N/S and with its S end abutting Wall A, Wall C had a maximum preserved length of about 3.20m. It was roughly coursed and survived to a maximum height of 0.55m; its maximum width was about 0.54m. Its Ν end was not preserved, probably because of erosion. Wall C was built without a foundation trench on top of a rather uneven construction level designated unit 5 (fig. 5). The wall, therefore, divided the interior of the semicircular structure into two areas, in which the ground surface had been raised by make-up dumps of earth. Toward the Ε and NE the ground surface was excavated as unit 3, which had a depth of 0.10-0.20m and was largely composed of light-coloured sandy earth with some pebbles and small stones in it. Toward the W and SW it was excavated as unit 4, which had a similar consistency but contained in addition some ash debris; this area was mostly dug in 1986.40 Excavation in the area to the Ε and NE of Wall C revealed a temporary earth floor, labelled unit 2, which was simply the compacted upper crust of unit 3; this surface was much eroded, especially to the N. Associated with it was an undistinguished oval-shaped informal fireplace, excavated as unit 1. Measuring approximately 1.30 (N/S) χ 1.00m (E/W), this hearth was delineated by a single row of small stones forming an ellipse. A small depression in its centre, 0.03m deep, was filled with loose, orange-brown burnt debris. The stoking entrance to the fireplace was from the S and was marked by a break in the row of stones surrounding it, where there were some traces of pebble surfacing. The latest identifiable pottery recovered from Phase 1 was post-Byzantine; other small finds included a fragment of a clay tobacco pipe (inv. 88.02) and numerous iron nails. Θ qLTUU !,n Fig. 13. TR 63 and the SE part of TR 65. Plan at the end of the 1988 campaign. TRENCH 63/5 (Figs. 13-15; Pis. 32:1-33: 2 ) TR 63, originally 5.00 (SW/NE) χ 4.60m (SE/NW), was sited directly off TR 65 with no intervening baulk.41 The trench was subsequently extended by a further 1.00m along the SW scarp, so that Walls 2 and 3 (see below) could be investigated, resulting in final dimensions of 6.00 (SW/NE) χ 4.60m (SE/NW). The excavation of TR 63 aimed at investigating more fully the structure to which the curved Wall 6 belonged, discovered and partly exposed in TR 65 in 1986.42 Since, however, at the end of the 1988 campaign the structure had not been fully exposed and the base of Wall 6 had not been reached, the present 40 Rep. 1986, 191 ff. with ill. 8. 41 Ibid. 188, 195ff. 42 Ibid. ills. 7, 11.</page><page sequence="18">110 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos account can only be provisional and no attempt has been made to present the results in neatly defined phases as is the case with the excavation of TR 61/2. Six walls (numbered 1-6) were uncovered altogether in the trench.43 Of these. Walls 1-4 belong to later phases of construction and will be described first. Wall 1, oriented SE/NW, has a preserved length of 2.15m in TR 63, but continues for a further 1.44m in TR 65, where it was also designated Wall l.44 Its highest preserved point is at a depth of 1.55m, while its base lies at a depth of 1.78-1.85m bd. Preserved to a single course, the wall was constructed of limestone, granodiorite, and schist, bonded with mud. The wall has an average width of 0.42m, although this can vary from 0.40 to 0.68m. Associated with this wall, along its SW face, is a neatly constructed fireplace, 'Feature Γ (fig. 13). Built almost exclusively of schist, its edges are defined by longer, thin, stones set on edge, while the floor is lined with slabs laid flat, many of which have been cracked by the heat.45 Wall 1 terminates clearly towards the SE, where a surface starts, designated unit 6, which must have provided access to the architectural units to the NE and SW. Connected with the surface, in the space between Walls 1 and 4, were three schist slabs, laid flat and oriented SE/NW, forming a simple threshold. This threshold, or doorstep, was designated Feature 2 and was subsequently removed. Wall 1 of TR 63, its continuation intoTR 65, and Wall 3 in that trench, form part of a domestic building to which Wall 4 and probably the rebuilt part of Wall 3 in TR 63 also belong. Wall 4, first encountered at a depth of 1.74m bd and oriented NE/SW, was exposed for a length of about 3.50m.47 Its width varies between 0.42 and 0.59m. The wall terminates to the SW, where there is a surface designated unit 6 (see above and below). It is of similar construction to Wall 1, although its one surviving course has a larger proportion of schist; as in Wall 1 the building material between stones was mud. Walls 2 and 3 are best treated together as they comprise different but closely connected phases of construction. Clearing and partial excavation around the two walls revealed that Wall 3, which has an average width of 1.14m, is a direct continuation of Wall A of the semicircular structure exposed in TR 61/2, beyond its junction with Wall B. Wall 3, therefore, must be of similar depth, extending considerably below the level reached by our excavation in 1988.4* The cleaning and partial excavation also showed that the upper preserved part of Wall 3 had been rebuilt, since it is constructed of smaller stones bonded with mud and is different from the rest of the wall, which is bonded with lime mortar identical to that of Walls A and Β of the semicircular structure. The upper, rebuilt part of Wall 3 is preserved to one, and in places, two courses. Wall 2 on the other hand, which is oriented SW/NE, abuts Wall 3, is later and may have originally straddled it, as suggested by a rather poorly preserved line of stones on top of it. Its base lies at a depth of 1.60-1.73m bd, extends for a length of 0.98m beyond the NE face of Wall 3 and has a maximum width of 0.43m. It is preserved to only a single course and includes at least one well-dressed block, probably reused from an earlier structure. Wall 2 is also bonded with mud. The four walls described above belong to three different phases of construction. The stratigraphical sequence associated with them can be described as follows. The clearance of the topsoil and of a quantity of tumble strewn over the entire area of the trench revealed the tops of Walls 1 and 4; the tops of Walls 2 and 3 were already partly visible prior to excavation.49 In the small area to the S of Wall 1 the sequence of events was fairly clear: an earth floor (unit 6), extended from the SE face of Wall 1 toward the SW termination of Wall 4 and as far as the NE face of the rebuilt part of Wall 3. This surface continued below Wall 2 reappearing in the S corner of the trench (where it was designated unit 7). Associated with this surface was the fireplace Feature 1 and the simple threshold Feature 2. Overlying this surface was a tile smash, cleared as unit 5. Therefore, Walls 1 and 4 and the rebuilt part of Wall 3 are contemporary, as are Features 1 and 2. Wall 2 belongs to a later phase largely eroded away,50 while the original part of Wall 3 clearly predates the construction of Walls 1 and 4. 43 A pile of stones along the external face of Wall 6 was designated 'Wall Τ in the course of excavation (fig. 13), but is unlikely to be a wall. 44 Rep. 1986, 195 and ill. 11. 4* It is very similar to some fireplaces of modern huts in and around the archaeological site of Torone. 46 To the same building must also belong Feature 1 in Trench 65 (see Rep. 1986, 195-6, ills. 11, 17). 4' The base of the wall lies at a depth of 1.89-1.99m bd. 48 Part of the wall wai exposed to a depth of about 1.20m by .the preliminary soundings of the Byzantine Ephoreia (see supra with n. 30). 49 The compacted upper crust of the topsoil was cleared as unit 1, which gave way to a similar, but less compacted, sub-topsoil cleared as unit 2. The stone tumble was excavated as unit 3; unit 4 refers to an ash lens excavated towards the SE. No floor surfaces were found associated with Wall 2.</page><page sequence="19">Excavations at Torone, 1988 111 In the area defined by the NE face of Wall 1 and the NW face of Wall 4, the stratigraphy was less clear and it was subsequently noted that a series of floors had subsided into the structure to which Wall 6 belongs, thought to be a cistern. The tile smash (unit 5), which lay on the surface (unit 6) extended for a short distance to the N, in the area between Walls 1 and 4, where it was cleared as unit 10. Here, below the tiles, the well laid surface unit 6 was not encountered, but only traces of a floor, which was designated unit 11. At the same level, further to the Ν and W we encountered neither floor surface nor tiles. Instead we observed a deposit of somewhat loose-textured yellow earth with pieces of mortar and many small stones (unit 8). Clearance of this deposit revealed the continuation of the tile smash, but at a level up to 0.56m deeper than that of the corresponding tiles to the S (fig. 14; pi. 32: 1). The tiles were intermingled with stones and partly overlain by them suggesting wall tumble. The tile smash, at this deeper level, was cleared as unit 12. Here, too, the tiles did not lie on a well defined surface, but rather on patches of a floor. These patches, relating to Walls 1 and 4 and to Feature 2, were cleared as unit 13, which corresponds to unit 11. Partly underlying units 11 and 13, in the small area immediately to the Ν of the unexcavated unit 6, was a deep pit, labelled Feature 3; the contents of this were cleared as unit IS. The fill of the pit was characterized by a soft-textured ashy earth containing much charcoal. In addition to fragmentary late glazed pottery, it yielded many iron nails, lumps of slag, as well as a bronze coin (inv. M88.71), a Byzantine trachy of the 13th cent. AD. The pit measured at least 1.50m across (SE/NW) and was dug to a depth of 0.46m. Its deepest point was at a depth of 2.60m bd. The pit extended under Walls 1 and 4 and was partly sealed by the floor units 6, 11, and 13. Since unit 6 was not excavated and since Walls 1 and 4 were not removed, the overall dimensions of the pit could not be established. In the eastern quarter of the trench, in the small area along the SE face of Wall 4, a shallow pass of earth, unit 9, was dug with the purpose of defining the face of the wall more clearly. Excavation was stopped here, however, before the base of the wall could be reached because of fear that deeper digging might endanger it. Clearance of the tile smash (units 10 and 12) and of the underlying traces of surface (units 11 and 13), revealed a brown earth towards the NW, designated unit 14, and a somewhat more compact, yellow earth towards the SE, unit 17. The latter was considered to be either the eroded remains, or the underpacking, of a floor, the better preserved parts of which were cleared as units 11 and 13. At this level, near the NE scarp of the trench, another pit was exposed at a depth of 2.28m bd. Only the southern part of this pit could be excavated because it continued beyond the trench to the N. Designated Feature 4, it had a maximum length of 0.80m and a depth of only 0.12m. Its edges were lined with reddish clay, fired hard, and its fill contained much charcoal and ash. It is best seen as a fire-pit associated with unit 17 and, therefore, also 51 with units 11 and 13. Following the removal of unit 17, and of part of unit 14, the preserved top of Wall 6 began to appear at a depth of 2.31m bd. At the same level with the excavation of TR 65 in 1986, a fairly substantial deposit of levelling fill appeared.52 It was therefore anticipated that the same loose-textured earth would continue in the area now under excavation. In its place, however, a complex stratigraphical sequence was observed consisting of two chronologically distinct groups of deposits, in part vertically contiguous, and at least four clear floor levels. This, as it was later shown, was the result of subsidence. oLiUTJ ]lm Fig. 14. TR 63. Plan of the tile smash (units 5, 10, and 12). Fig. 14. TR 63. Plan of the tile smash (units 5, 10, and 12). 51 The edges of the pit, especially on the west side, were difficult to define, and two later passes designated unit 37, along with one of the rubber buckets of unit 18, were almost certainly part of the filS of the pit. 52 Rep. 1986, 196.</page><page sequence="20">112 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos with an important interface of units located at the very division of TR 63 and 65 (note the location of 'Wall 5' on fig. 13). In the area bounded by Wall 1 to the SW and by Wall 6 elsewhere, two distinct groups of deposits were revealed. The first group, which appeared toward the SW, included in descending stratigraphie order units 31,46,47, and 50. Of these, unit 31 appeared at a depth of 2.45m bd and was a fairly compact yellow-brown earth containing some small stones but almost no bone, shell or other organic material. Underneath were units 46 and 47. Unit 47, which first appeared at a depth of 3.65m, was essentially the same as unit 31, but distinguished from it by a slightly loose texture and a somewhat greater quantity of stone. Unit 46, on the other hand, which first appeared at a depth of 3.47-3.61mbd, was a lens of loose-textured earth containing much crushed mortar. Unit 50 was a plaster floor exposed at a depth varying between 3.87 and 4.01m bd extending from the feature labelled 'Wall 5' in the NE, towards the SW where it met Wall 6. Clearly associated with these deposits is 'Wall 5', which first appeared at a depth of 2.97m (pi. 32: 6-7). Its SW part is oriented SSW/NNE but curves around to an E/W orientation. It has a maximum preserved length of 0.75m along its inner face and seems to have been made entirely of schist, with an attempt at irregular coursing of the stone toward its bottom (as exposed), which became more random towards its top. Coarse white plaster was found clinging to the face of many of the stones, while lumps of plaster or mortar were visible between stones, in spite of the fact that the main bonding agent was a fine, light brown mud. The plaster floor (unit 50) extends under the lowest visible course of 'Wall 5', perhaps over another course of stones, which forms the foundation of the wall. It does not extend beyond the NW face of the wall and, therefore, the two must be contemporary. The floor unit 50 was not excavated. The uppermost preserved part of 'Wall 5' (a zone approximately 0.13m deep) is pure mortar, approximately 0.09m thick. At one point there is a small area measuring 0.06 χ 0.06m of finer faced plaster, approximately 0.035m thick, similar in appearance to that on the internal face of Wall 6 (see below). Elsewhere, the mortar or plaster face of 'Wall 5' was similar to that used in the composition of the floor unit 50. In addition to being curved, 'Wall 5' leans inward, toward the S. It would seem, also, that originally it extended up to the face of Wall 6 to the NE. This is suggested by coarse plaster, which was found attached to the finer plaster of Wall 6, at one point preserved up to 0.05m above the level of the plaster floor (pi. 33: 2).53 The outer, NW, face of 'Wall 5' was difficult to define at the end of the 1988 campaign. Further excavation should allow us to distinguish more clearly between it and tumbled stone close to it. Collectively units 31, 46, and 47, dug to a depth of 1.56m from the top of unit 31 to the top of the plaster floor (unit 50), yielded a good deal of pottery and other small finds, including some Classical as well as prehistoric ones. The latest identifiable material, which was also the largest component, was of Hellenistic date and comprised, among the finer pottery, conspicuous fragments of West Slope Ware. The second distinct group of deposits, which was located in the NE part of the structure to which Wall 6 belongs, consisted of eighteen units. Although in part vertically contiguous with units 31, 46, 47, and 50, all yielded fragmentary pottery and other small finds of Late- or post-Byzantine date. The horizontal extent of the deposits reached by the end of the 1988 campaign is shown on fig. 15. The area of the plaster floor unit 50 defines almost exactly the horizontal extent of the overlying units 31, 46, and 47. The floor, along with units 49, 51, and 52 remains unexcavated. Unit 52 is the top of a soft, dark soil with many small stones lying at a depth of 4.26-4.34m bd. It is vertically and horizontally distinct from unit 50, but may underlie unit 49 further to the NE. Unit 51 is a dark, rather coarse-grained soil containing many flecks of mortar. It is vertically contiguous but horizontally distinct from unit 50. The more substantial unit 49, first encountered at a depth of 3.79m, slopes down rather steeply toward the E, where it was met at a depth of 4.36m bd. Towards the NW the depression indicated on fig. 15 appears to be part of the same deposit. Unit 49 has something of the appearance of a rather uneven trampled surface over fill; partial scraping at certain points showed it to be rather loose-textured underneath. The excavated units overlying units 49, 51, and 52 began, in ascending stratigraphie order, with unit 45. This was an extremely loose-textured deposit, identical to that encountered further to the NW in 1986. The matrix was a dark soil containing many small stones, much ash and charcoal, in addition to copious quantities of sea shells and animal bones. At points up to 0.74m thick,54 unit 45 also yielded fragmentary pottery in large quantities, much of which was recovered in large fragments, with many joins noted among sherds. The largest component of the material recovered comprised Late- or post-Byzantine glazed and plain wares. The late date of the deposit was verified by the discovery of a clay tobacco pipe fragment 53 The floor unit SO runs up and slightly onto the finer plaster facing of Wall 6; its coarser plaster is preserved up to a thickness of 0.06m. 54 The starting level was 3.53-3.62m and the closing level was 3.79-4.36m bd.</page><page sequence="21">Excavations at Torone, 1988 113 (inv. 88.469).55 Both in its make-up and its contents unit 45 was typical of domestic refuse and resembled very closely the fill of many of the Byzantine or post-Byzantine rubbish pits excavated in TR 67, 68, and 72 (see below). The overlying unit 42 was also refuse fill, very similar to unit 45 but distinguished from it by a somewhat lighter yellow-brown colour.56 Small finds and organic debris in it were similar to those of unit 45 but in smaller quantities. The latest identifiable material was again post-Byzantine, including another fragmentary clay tobacco pipe (inv. 88.433). Overlying unit 42 was unit 41 which, in appearance, was almost identical to unit 45. Fragments of at least two clay tobacco pipes (inv. 88.415 and 88.331) were recovered from it, as well as 28 iron nails, in addition to a good quantity of glazed and plain pottery. Units 45, 42, and 41 are, therefore, best seen as part of the same refuse fill. Encountered directly on top of this fill, but still within the space enclosed by the curved Wall 6, was the earliest of a series of floors. Designated unit 40, it consisted of a mottled, moderately hard layer of yellow-brown to dark brown mud with patches of red in it. The floor surface itself was designated unit 36 (pi. 32: 5). Significantly, this surface did not extend as far as Wall 6, nor as far as unit 31 to the SW but was separated from both by a 0.05-0.20m gap; the softer earth separating units 36 and 40 from unit 31 was excavated as unit 39. Moreover, the surface unit 36 dipped down towards the centre to a depth of 3.22m bd, while toward the edges it curled up reaching levels varying from 2.97m to 3.03m bd. The surface consisted of compact yellow-brown clay with many small white, yellow, green and red inclusions. Lying on it was a thin deposit of what must have been occupation debris characterized by a rather soft earth, variously coloured red and black, and a lens of fine grey ash debris, perhaps the result of an informal fireplace. This deposit was excavated as unit 33. In addition to many pottery fragments and at least one complete vessel (inv. 88.172) of Late- or post-Byzantine date, the deposit yielded pieces of charcoal as well as animal bone, sea shell, pieces of sea-urchin and some fish scales. The deposits above this level had the appearance of make-up dumps laid with the purpose of creating a level for the succeeding floor. These deposits were designated units 32 and 30. Of these the first was characterized by a moderately compact yellow-brown earth containing many small and medium-sized stones. The second (unit 30) was mostly domestic refuse; its soft-textured, dark, ashy soil yielded large quantities of organic material, as well as a good deal of pottery. Among many other small finds, it produced a silver Ottoman coin (inv. M88.90), an engraved gem (inv. 88.146; pi. 34: 6) and the base fragment of a black-glaze vessel (inv. 88.175). Above this, three successive floors were uncovered quite distinct from each other, but similar in their make-up, consisting of hard-packed yellowish clay with an admixture of pebbles. All three surfaces dipped considerably toward the centre, curling up noticeably toward the NE and SW, as well as toward the SE and NW. None of them reached as far as Wall 6 or as far as the more compact unit 31 toward the SW. The first of these floors, in ascending stratigraphie order, was designated unit 29 (pi. 32: 4); it was 0.08-0.15m thick and its upper surface was characterized by many small ridges. Towards the SW it rose to a level of 2.66m bd; toward the centre it sunk to a level 2.88m bd. Further NE, c ο a portion of the same floor, here designated unit 25 (pi. 32: 4), ran over the top of Wall 6. It dropped 0.32m within a horizontal space of only 0.45m and continued, after a slight break, as unit 29. oLTLTlJ ~L Fig. 15. TR 63/65.

Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Above it, a floor of similar thickness and appearance was dug as units 27 and 28 (pi. 32:3), encountered at depths varying between 2.37 and 2.79m bd. Above this, in turn, a fourth surface was met (that is, fourth above the floor unit 36), up to 0.10m in thickness (directly above units 27 and 28). This fourth surface was designated unit 26. Associated with it were several depressions, two of which are clearly illustrated on pi. 32: 2, containing small pieces of charcoal and soft, ashy earth. Toward the centre of the floor a thin ash lens, 0.90 (NW/SE) χ 0.62m (SW/NE) was encountered and cleared as unit 24. Also associated with this floor was Feature 5 (pl. 32:2), consisting of a group of small unworked stones, placed together in a roughly circular arrangement, the function of which is uncertain.59 Overlying the floor unit 26 and its associated ash lens (unit 24) were units 23, 22, and 21. Unit 23 was near the Ν corner of the area under excavation and consisted of hard, fairly compact reddish earth. In texture and general appearance it resembled the floor unit 26 below; it may therefore represent the remains of another surface. Unit 22 was a thin ashy deposit partly overlying 23, while unit 21, also toward the N, consisted of a hard yellow to light-brown earth resembling in texture unit 23. Unit 21 too may have been the remains of a floor surface. It seems likely, therefore, that units 23 and 21 may represent a partial resurfacing of the floor unit 26. Unit 26, along with 21 and 23, was subsequently overlain by units 19 and 20, which were characterized by a loosely packed soil containing much ashy debris. The deposits covering these (units 14 and 17) have been described above. Wall 6 itself first appeared at a depth of 2.31m bd and was exposed down to a depth of 4.36m, at which point its base had not yet been reached.61 Judging by the parts of the wall that were visible behind its plaster coating (pi. 33: 1), it is constructed largely of schist, although several blocks of limestone and granodiorite were also visible. The schist blocks that could be seen on the inner face are generally speaking laid flat in neat, but rather irregular courses. A fine yellow-brown mud was used as a bonding agent, while smaller pieces of schist fill the interstices. The highest stone in situ in the wall (pi. 32: 6) is a large well-dressed block, the flat upper surface of which measures 0.30 χ 0.50m (elsewhere at this level the wall has been entirely robbed). Measurements taken from the plastered edge of this highest stone showed that the wall tapers out downward by a maximum of 0.06m. 2 The parts of the wall, where stones had been robbed from its inner face show that its core consisted of smaller stones laid very irregularly. The precise width of the wall cannot at present be accurately measured since excavation has not been carried out at its external face. It is likely, however, that its thickness is at least 0.80m. As already mentioned, the inner face of Wall 6 was covered by a substantial coat of medium coarse plaster or cement, well preserved over almost the entire part so far exposed (pis. 32: 6; 33: 2 and n. 71 below), which has a thickness of 0.022-0.045m. It is off-white and contains numerous, predominantly light-coloured sea-worn pebbles. In places the plaster face is poked by small indentations c.0.015 χ 0.015 χ 0.002m made to assist the adhesion of a second coat of plaster, which is preserved only in patches (pi. 33: 2). Where it survives the second coat is thin, quite hard and somewhat finer than the first; it has a thickness of about 0.02m. It has a similar, off-white colour and contains occasional very small inclusions. The surface is fine and smooth, but it too has been scored to assist the adhesion of a further coat. This third coat of plaster is mainly preserved in one patch, covering approximately a 0.72 χ 0.86m area, toward the S, although traces of it (but not its face) remain also elsewhere on the wall. It adheres poorly to the second coat and required conservation in the field. This third coat, which is c.0.07m thick, is fairly coarse and pinkish in colour; it contains many small inclusions, but has a moderately fine face. The first two coats of plaster or cement are preserved underneath the much rougher traces of plaster associated with the extension of 'Wall 5', where it is thought to have once met Wall 6, and the plaster floor unit 50 (pi. 33: 2). Both coats are, therefore, earlier. Traces of the third plaster coating of Wall 6 are preserved at some points below the level of unit 50, which suggests that the third coating also might predate unit 50 and 'Wall 5'. The surviving architectural features described above and the stratigraphie evidence obtained by excavation suggest the following sequence of events in the structure defined by Wall 6 and its immediate surrounds: 59 It may have been some kind of stand supporting a vessel or a post hole with chocking stones around it. Feature 5 had a maximum length of 0.33m. 60 Several small tile fragments lying flat upon unit 23 support its identification as a floor surface. 61 The greatest height of the wall as exposed at any one point was 1.80m. 62 Cf. the tapering out downwards of the wall· in the double apsidal cistern at Perachora (K. A. Tomlinson, BSA 64, 1969, 159; H. Payne et al., Perachora I [1940] 14).</page><page sequence="23">Excavations at Torone, 1988 115 m (a) Wall 6 was built first. Although a terminus post quem for the date of its construction was not established, a tentative terminus ante quem is indicated by the material recovered from units 31, 46, and 47 and units 18, 34, and 38 suggesting a Hellenistic or even earlier date for the wall. (b) A period of reuse or secondary use of the structure followed, which included the laying of the plaster floor unit SO and the construction of 'Wall 5'.64 This reuse or secondary use of the structure also seems to be not later than Hellenistic because of the events described under (c). (c) The plaster floor unit SO and 'Wall S' fell into disuse and the entire internal area of the structure defined by Wall 6 was filled in. The latest identifiable pottery from this fill (units 31, 46, and 47) is Hellenistic. (d) At a significantly later date the fill mentioned under (c) was dug out partially, as indicated by the location and appearance of units 31, 46, 47, SO and 'Wall 5' toward the SW of the area excavated. The sharp vertical interface between units 31, 46, 47, and SO, on the one hand, and the units to the NE, on the other, suggests that the space created by this digging out did not remain empty for any length of time, especially since the earliest deposits to the NE, which have been dug so far consist of domestic refuse. (e) The empty space mentioned under (d) was filled with loose refuse (units 4S, 42, and 41), which yielded large quantities of post-Byzantine material. (f) The structure to which Walls 1 and 4 belong was built and associated floor surfaces were laid over the structure defined by Wall 6 and the refuse mentioned under (e). (g) The parts of the floor surfaces directly lying over the fill of refuse mentioned under (e) sunk into the structure defined by Wall 6 because of the loose texture of the refuse.65 Over the top of Wall 6 itself, as well as over the more compact units 31,46, and 47, these surfaces had remained at their original levels since there was no need for successive resurfacing of the original floor. It should be mentioned, however, that at these points the original surface—or perhaps surfaces—was poorly preserved and in parts completely eroded; what remained of it was excavated as units 11 and 13. The fact that at least four and perhaps as many as six surfaces were excavated, and the presence of occupation debris overlying some of them would suggest that the subsidence was not sudden. (h) The structure comprising Walls 1, 4, and the rebuilt part of Wall 3 (which was presumably domestic), along with Features 1 and 2, went out of use. The roof collapsed, hence the smashed tile units 10 and 12 on the eroded surfaces units 11 and 13,67 and subsequently part of the superstructure of these walls tumbled over the tiles. The fact that part of this tile smash was found lying at a level lower than the rest by up to O.S6m suggests that a certain amount of subsidence occurred after the building had gone out of use. The precise date of construction of Wall 6 can only be established by further excavation. The terminus ante quem, discussed above, for a construction date in the Hellenistic period, or earlier, appears to be supported by the evidence of the material recovered from the deposit, only partly excavated, along the 63 It il worth noting here that the quantity of BA and EIA pottery obtained from the excavated units fuggeiti that digging in greater depth may reveal clean corresponding strata. 64 The function of the feature designated 'Wall 5' is uncertain and might be clarified only by further excavation to the SW. Further excavation might also clarify the nature of the reuse of the structure to which Wall 6 belongs. It is most unlikely that the floor unit 50 was the floor of the original structure, since Wall 6 clearly continues below its level, perhaps to considerable depth. The plaster floor unit SO, which has not been removed and which must be connected with 'Wall 5', probably consists of packed small broken rubble with plaster applied only to its surface (cf. Tomlinson art. cit. 159). 65 The evidence for the degree of subsidence is considerable: firstly, the difference in height between the remains of the uppermost floor surface associated with Wall 4 (units 11 and 13) and the lowest level of the tile smash lying over them (unit 12) is 0.56m. Secondly, all the floor surfaces directly overlying the loose fill of refute to the NE of the area under excavation rose significantly toward the edges without extending as far as Wall 6 (this is true even of the more compact deposits to the SW). This subsidence is especially pronounced in the surface unit 25 which ran over Wall 6 and dropped 0.32m over a horizontal distance of 0.45m. Cf. the level of subsidence of the floor of the South House at Mycenae, P. A. Mountjoy, BSA 71, 1976, 77ff. esp. 80 fig. 20. 66 The subsidence appears to have occurred in two main stages: at a first stage the original floor surface (unit 36) subsided and additional fill was brought in (units 32 and 30) to create a level for the second floor (unit 29). At a second stage, however, successive floors, above unit 29, must have been laid more or less directly one on top of the other, since little occupation debris was found on some of them and no levelling fill whatsoever. 67 One should also mention the tiles of unit 5 lying over the best preserved part of the floor unit 6, as described above.</page><page sequence="24">116 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos external face of Wall 6, in the small area between it and the later Wall 4 (fig. 13). First encountered at a depth of 2.34m bd, the deposit was allocated three unit numbers in the course of excavation, (18, 34, and 38). All three were clearly part of the same deposit characterized by a fine, rather compact, clayey earth, light yellow to brown. Although only a small part of this deposit could be excavated because of the limited space available, it showed no signs of having been cut, or dug into, for the construction of Wall 6. By the end of the 1988 campaign the deposit had not been fully dug. It could therefore be the contents of a large foundation trench for Wall 6, or a levelling fill laid at the time of construction, or shortly after, for the purpose of raising the ground level to the required height. The latest identifiable material recovered from the deposit was Hellenistic. If this deposit proves to be the contents of a foundation trench for Wall 6, the structure represented by this wall must have been built—but also must have fallen into disuse and been filled in—in the course of the Hellenistic period. The identification of the structure represented by Wall 6 as a cistern seems, at present, reasonable, because of the lack of a natural water supply on the promontory70 and the fact that the internal face of the wall is coated with waterproof plaster or cement.7 The parts of Wall 6 so far exposed suggest for the structure a circular or near circular plan, which, however, can only be verified by further excavation to the W. If the structure is circular it should have a diameter of approximately 4.00m.72 TRENCH 67 (Figs. 16-17; PI. 33: 3) By the conclusion of the 1986 campaign two pits were exposed, but not excavated, in the S quarter of TR 67; these were designated Pits 3 and 4 (fig. 16).73 Only the NW half of Pit 4 was revealed; the remainder was located below Wall 4 and the baulk separating TR 67 and 65. Although not dug, the pit may be dated to the post-Byzantine period on the basis of a clay tobacco pipe bowl encountered in the upper level of its fill during the preliminary cleaning. The pit has a maximum preserved length of at least 1.20m. Further cleaning around the area of Pit 4 also showed that the stone block designated 'Wall 21' in 1986 was a fallen slab and not a wall. Pit 3 was only partially excavated. The upper part of the fill, first encountered at a depth of 2.42m bd, comprised many stones intermingled with fragments of roof tiles. Lower down, the fill was a soft-textured earth varying in colour between brown and red, and easily distinguished from the earth into which the pit was dug. With depth the colour of the soil assumed a more reddish tinge (evidently caused by pieces of decayed unfired, or poorly fired, clay, samples of which were kept), giving way to a somewhat darker colour further down. The pit was excavated to a depth of 3.52m bd; its maximum diameter was 1.38m. The fill yielded a good quantity of organic material such as charcoal, animal bone, sea shell (including mother-of-pearl), fish bones, and fish scales. Lumps of disintegrated mortar and slag were also recorded. Among the small finds there were fragments of pottery, some ten iron nails, a bronze coin (inv.

Partial clearance of its contents and subsequent excavation of a small quantity of earth into which the pit was dug revealed, more clearly, the Ε face of the wall (fig. 17; pi. 33: 3). Oriented N/S, Wall 20 was exposed for a length of 2.95m, with its northernmost preserved block underlying the later Wall 5.74 Excavation along the W face of the wall was not possible because of the small size of the area under excavation. The wall was first encountered at a depth of 2.70m bd and had a maximum width of 0.45m. It was built of a variety of stone, bonded with mud. The uppermost surviving course included large, well-dressed, granodiorite blocks, with small pieces of schist used to fill interstices. Toward the S corner of the trench the wall had a number of small schist slabs laid one on top of the other in a 'ladder-like' fashion. This style of construction is similar to that of a number of house walls on Terrace IV,75 and is • 76 also a feature of the Classical city wall C. The lower portion of Wall 20 was constructed of smaller slabs of unworked or only roughly hewn granodiorite and schist, laid in neatly jointed but not very regular courses. Here the wall face protruded slightly beyond the line of the well-dressed blocks above, suggesting wall foundation. No trace, however, of a foundation trench was detected because of the disturbance caused by Pit 3. It should be noted that the earth by the Ε face of the wall, into which Pit 3 was dug (largely composed of stone rubble, stone chips and roof-tile fragments), yielded predominantly Classical pottery, along with some prehistoric sherds, especially from the lower passes of the layer. This material, and the style of construction, would indicate that Wall 20 is either Classical or Hellenistic.77 TRENCH 68 (Figs. 18-23; Pis. 33:4-34: 2) TR 68, measuring 7.0 χ 6.0m, was sited directly off the NE scarp of TR 67; it was the largest and most complex of the trenches opened in 1988. The trench was excavated in 62 units and yielded 181 rubber buckets of pottery. Eleven walls of various periods were exposed, while the contents of no fewer than nine rubbish pits were cleared or partially dug. Of the late structures in the trench. Walls 1 and 2 were visible above ground prior to digging. Clearance of the topsoil78 and of a large quantity of stone tumble overlying the entire trench,79 revealed Wall 3. These three walls were used to subdivide the trench into separately excavated sectors, designated the north-east, south, and west sectors. Excavation to any depth was only possible in the south sector, where important prehistoric architectural remains were exposed. Considerable further work is required in this and the other sectors before we can clarify the nature of occupation and the successive phases of construction; therefore, the following account can only be provisional. Walls 1 and 3, bonded at right angles, defined the Ε corner of a late, post-Byzantine, domestic structure, part of which was excavated in 1986.80 Wall 1, oriented SW/NE, represents the direct continuation of Wall 1 in TR 67. A length of 3.05m of this wall was exposed in TR 68 and its overall length from the S corner of the structure inTR 67 to its Ecorner inTR 68 measures about 7.60m. Wall 1 is of dry-rubble construction consisting of an admixture of granodiorite, limestone, and schist, mostly small and medium slabs, either unworked or only roughly hewn. The stones were laid in rough courses; of these several were preserved in TR 67, but, for the most part, only two in TR 68. The preserved top of Wall 1 in TR 68 was first encountered at a depth of 2.04m bd; its base at 2.44m. nrui ι Ο im 0 im Fig. 17. TR 67.

The schist-constructed feature resembling a bin (TR 67 Feature 3, see Rep. 1986, 202 nn. 65-6 and ill. 12) may well be associated with the structure represented by Wall 20. 78 The topsoil (designated unit 1) over most of the area of the trench was characterized by a compact, hard and well-trodden brown to dark brown soil. In parts of the trench, a loose, dark humus had accumulated over the previously deposited soil, the result of the few bushes on the promontory. 79 It included some large, well-dressed, grano diorite blocks. Apart from the latter, slabs or pieces of schist, limestone and some conglomerate were also noted. Mostly cleared as unit 2, the tumble was particularly concentrated in the area Ν and Ε of Wall 2. 80 Rep. 1986, 197f. ill. 12; Walls 1 and 2 in TR 67 define the S corner of the same structure.</page><page sequence="26">118 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Fig. 18. TR 68. Plan at the end of the 1988 campaign. Oriented SE/NW, Wall 3 was mostly preserved to one or two courses, with its base lying at 2.51m bd. The wall extends to the WNW, where it must join Wall 3 in TR 72 (the junction of the two walls awaits excavation). Walls 1 and 3 have an average width of 0.45-0.50m. Wall 2, oriented SE/NW, is of similar construction to Walls 1 and 3. At points it survives in up to five courses, despite its very poor quality. Its width varies between 0.50 and 0.70m and there is a very slight bend to it at one point. It was exposed for a length of at least 2.80m in TR 68, although it does continue, for some distance, toward the SE. Toward the NW the wall seems to terminate with a large well-dressed block, in secondary use, placed lengthwise across the wall (fig. 18; pi. 33: 7). The excavation of the west sector, in the internal area defined by Walls 1 and 3, was straightforward. Clearance of topsoil and stone tumble81 revealed a thin, loose-textured deposit, dark brown in colour, designated unit 25 and best seen as sub-topsoil. This deposit directly overlay the tile smash unit 30 (pi. 35: 4). The tiles were lifted in nine rubber buckets, revealing the floor of the post-Byzantine structure represented by Walls 1 and 3. Part of the same tile smash had been cleared in 1986 in TR 67, where also the associated floor had been dug.82 The part of the floor exposed in TR 68 was not dug in 1988. In the larger north-east sector, the stone tumble associated with topsoil was particularly concentrated. Its clearance (units 2, 4, and 16)83 brought to light a loose-textured, dark-brown deposit largely free of 81 Unit IS yielded two bronze coins (inv. M88.61 and M88.62), both of which await closer study. 82 Rep. 1986, 198. 83 The uppermost part of the layer of stone tumble was cleared as unit 2, its continuation as unit 4. The latter was partly composed of dark earth with a great deal of root action; it yielded nine rubber buckets of pottery and roof-tile fragments. The latest identif able material was post-Byzantine, including a silver Ottoman coin (inv. M88.48). Varying quantities of earlier material were encountered, including BA, EIA, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Byzantine. The deposit also yielded many iron nails and other iron objects, as well as many fragments of at least one and possibly more architectural fittings made of terracotta and plaster, which await conservation. Unit 16 refers to a concentration of tumble largely located towards the E.</page><page sequence="27">Excavations at Torone, 1988 119 stone, unit 22.84 It was during the excavation of this unit that the original top of Wall 4 first appeared. Unit 22 yielded twelve rubber buckets of fragmentary pottery and roof tiles (97.35kg), the latest identifiable material being post-Byzantine, including a fragmentary clay tobacco pipe (inv. 88.127). Among the earlier material were a Greek bronze coin (inv. M88.73), a lead sheet (inv. M88.81), and an architectural terracotta fragment (inv. 88.87), perhaps depicting a ram's head. Wall 4 was one of the most interesting features discovered in 1988 (fig. 18; pi. 33: 5-6). The wall is not structural but was made to carry a row of terracotta pipes which channelled water from the higher ground of the promontory to the SW into the large double cistern excavated in the early 1970s (fig. 3).85 The top of Wall 4 has a clear inclination from SW to NE, which follows its orientation; the top of the NE portion of the will is 0.35m lower than that in the SW. Coupled with this inclination is a narrowing of the wall towards the NE (fig. 18),87 where the water-pipes are preserved in situ (pi. 33: 5). Wall 4 extends to the NE, beyond the scarp of the trench, presumably as far as the Byzantine double cistern; although the junction of the two will only be better understood by means of further excavation.88 The construction of Wall 4 was mainly of small to medium blocks, predominantly limestone; a quantity of tiles, and fragments thereof, were also used. The bonding agent, also used for the greater part of the wall top, was a substantial lime mortar. Although cracked and broken, and in parts not preserved, the individual terracotta pipes narrow towards one end, which is slotted into the next pipe, thus increasing the pressure of the water-flow. Toward the SW the pipes themselves were not preserved, but their position is clear from their imprint in the mortar (pi. 33: 6). The preserved length of Wall 4 in the north-east sector was 3.16m; a smaller part, 0.72m long and 0.68m wide, was encountered in the south sector of the trench. This smaller part was separated from the stretch in the north-east sector by a cut through the wall extending down to a level well below its base. At the SW end of the longer stretch of the wall, a large reused Classical block was set upright, on edge, within a packing of clay (pi. 34:1). These features would suggest an attempt to block the flow of the water. Wall 4 was not preserved toward the SW scarp of the trench; the damage at this point would almost certainly have been the result of the laying of the foundation for Wall l.89 The material recovered from the units associated with the cutting through Wall 4 and the erection of the upright slab, points to a post-Byzantine date.90 The deposits associated with Wall 4, on the other hand, suggest that it was constructed during the Byzantine period (see below). The location of Wall 4 subdivided the north-east sector into two smaller quarters, which determined its subsequent excavation. In the Ν quarter, underlying unit 22, a distinct soil was met containing many small stones, characterized by a fairly compact texture and a brown colour. Designated unit 41, the deposit was clearly associated with Wall 4 and appeared to represent fill laid shortly after its construction for the purpose of raising the ground level to the desired height. Recovered from unit 41 were two bronze Byzantine trachys (inv. M88.105 and M88.106) probably dating to the first half of the 13th cent. AD. The . associated pottery was mixed: fragments of Β A, EIA, Classical or Hellenistic, and Roman pottery were recorded. The latest fragments were of glazed vessels; their state of preservation and our inadequate knowledge of the development of Byzantine and post-Byzantine pottery make a precise dating impossible. The deposit did not yield any sherds that could firmly be dated to the post-Byzantine era. 84 Starting level 2.67-2.89m bd. 85 Cf. supra η. 30. 86 The surviving top of Wall 4 lay at depths varying between 2.62 and 2.99m bd, while its base was at a depth of 3.29m. The minimum width of Wall 4, to the NE, is 0.36m; the maximum, to the SW, 0.60m. gg The relationship of Wall 4 to the double cistern is also obscured by walls overlying the S corner of the latter. 89 Nor was any trace of Wall 4 encountered in TR 67 in 1986, see Rep. 1986, ill. 12. 90 The excavation units here were nos. 21, 23, 34, and 45. Unit 23 represents the clay packing overlying Wall 4, into which the upright block was set. It yielded at least 20 fragments of pottery which looked Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine. Overlying unit 23, and clearly atiociated with it, wat unit 21, representing a portion of the packed red clay-floor associated with the standing upright block and mostly preserved in the south sector of the trench. The latest identifiable material among the fragmentary pottery and other small finds was post-Byzantine. The fill of the cutting through Wall 4 was mostly excavated as units 34 and 45; both yielded fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery in addition to varying quantities of earlier wares. Unit 61, from which were recovered only 18 small and mostly unidentifiable fragments of pottery and one fragment of glass, represents the material recovered late in the season as a result of the removal of the block standing upright.</page><page sequence="28">120 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Underlying unit 41 was unit 62, which represents a deposit of brown soil, somewhat lighter in colour to that of unit 41, with much stone rubble. Clearance of unit 62 yielded fragmentary pottery very similar to that encountered in 41, although with a notable increase in the quantity of earlier material. No further work was carried out in the Ν quarter in 1988.91 One of the stones associated with unit 62 remains in situ·, it preserves, on its upper visible face, a 'T'-shaped cutting. Excavation of the Ε quarter of the north-east sector revealed a more complex stratigraphical sequence and confirmed the impression offered by the evidence of units 41 and 62, that Wall 4 was constructed in the course of the Byzantine, rather than post-Byzantine, period. With the removal of unit 22, two distinct deposits were defined horizontally. Of these the lighter coloured unit 33 in the SE portion of the Ε quarter represents the upper level of the fill of Pit 6. This pit (fig. 21; pi. 33: 7) extended below Wall 2 into the south sector of the trench. The lower level of the pit fill in the east sector was cleared as unit 37; the bottom of the pit, in the same sector, was reached at a depth of 3.53m bd. The contents and excavation of Pit 6 are described below. Toward the Ν and NW of the Ε quarter the darker earth underlying unit 22 was designated unit 39. This deposit was fairly loose in texture and was characterized by a very dark brown colour, approaching black. It contained a good deal of organic material (animal bone, sea shell, and charcoal), pieces of mortar, and some slag. Like unit 41 in the Ν quarter, it yielded Byzantine coins; three bronze trachys (inv. M88.100, M88.102, and M88.103), probably dating to the first half of the 13th cent. AD. Unlike unit 41, however, unit 39 had the appearance of destruction debris. The deposit extended for a short distance under Wall 2 into the south sector of the trench, where it was designated unit 38. Of the pottery recovered from units 38 and 39 the largest component was that of fragments of late glazed wares, although here too a good quantity of earlier material was recorded. Among the glazed pottery two fragmentary vessels (inv. 88.191 and 88.190) are thought to be Byzantine. It is not certain at present how much of the remaining glazed pottery is Byzantine or later. It is clear, however, that since Pit 6 cut through unit 39, its contents (apart from residual material) must be later than the material from the two units. Below unit 39, and also dug through by the cutting for Pit 6, a lighter, more compact earth was encountered, designated unit 42.92 Only one rubber bucket of pottery was collected from this deposit, which also included 6.52kg of roof-tile fragments. The largest component of the fragmentary pottery was Classical, although several scraps of BA pottery and at least two sherds of Late Roman date were also noted. Ten small fragments of later glazed wares found in the same deposit can only be dated generally to the Byzantine or post-Byzantine period. Clearance of unit 42 brought to light two further deposits, horizontally distinct from each other and designated units 44 and 52. The former represents the fill of yet another pit, Pit 8. Only partly defined, it extends below Wall 4 and, beyond the area of the trench, towards the NE. Only its SE portion was within the area of TR 68, measuring 1.48 χ 0.78m in plan. The fill of Pit 8, which first appeared at a depth of 3.36m bd, was excavated as unit 44; it was, however, further subdivided into five vertical passes distinguished by rubber bucket number. With the excavation of the fifth pass (unit 44, #545), at a depth of 5.07m bd, the fill of the pit had not been exhausted. The upper level of the fill, the first three passes, was characterized by a loose-textured, dark earth, which was rather moist and contained numerous chips of decayed schist. The pottery recovered from the first three passes was very fragmentary and rather worn. It was mostly Classical and Late Roman, although occasional scraps of Β A pottery, two fragments of glass, and three small fragments of late glazed pots were also recorded. At the beginning of the fourth pass, at a depth of 4.76m bd, the fill was largely composed of decayed mortar, which extended to a depth of 4.96m. The fifth and lowest pass of the fill was largely composed of earth similar to that of the first three passes, but with some pieces of mortar also in it. At least twelve sherds of Byzantine or post-Byzantine pottery (more likely the former) were recovered from the lowest pass intermingled with a small quantity of earlier wares. Unit 52, into which the cutting for Pit 8 was dug, was exposed over most of the area of the Ε quarter of the north-east sector. The deposit, which was characterized by a compact light brown soil, was excavated in three vertical passes.93 During its excavation the preserved top of Wall 7 appeared at a depth of 3.39-3.47m bd and an area of paving to its W. The unit largely yielded pottery of Classical date, but it also contained a small quantity of earlier material, including the occasional fragment of BA pottery, a 91 The closing level of unit 62 was 3.09m bd. 92 Starting level: 3.25m; closing level: 3.36m bd. 93 The first pass (designated unit 52 #550-1 and #554) represents the part of the deposit which had been cut through by Pit 6; the second (52 #557) and third (52 #559) panes covered the entire area of the H quarter, including the area below Pit 6, but not the area cut by Pit 8.</page><page sequence="29">Excavations at Torone, 1988 121 quantity of PG sherds and a few fragments of Late Geometric and Archaic date. Not more than ten small sherds of post-Classical glazed pots were encountered in the upper pass; these are best seen as intrusive, especially on account of Pits 6 and 8. Wall 7, oriented S/N, was constructed of an admixture of limestone, schist, and granodiorite slabs, bonded with mud. The wall was exposed for a length of 2.12m in the Ε quarter, but continued below Wall 2, where a small portion of its W face was exposed in a 0.90m stretch in the south sector of the trench. The overall preserved length of the wall would therefore be at least 4.0m. It is worth noting that Wall 7 is parallel to Wall S. The wall is clearly Classical and its relative chronological position is nicely fixed by the fact that it overlies Pit 9 (see below), which is also Classical and by the fact that its W face is partly hidden by the Classical paving, largely exposed in the south sector of the trench (see below). The wall was therefore built sometime after Pit 9, but before the laying of the paving. Moreover, the SE edge of the later Pit 8 cut through portion of Wall 7. The base of the wall lay at a depth of 3.55m bd. Clearance of unit 52 revealed the presence of a large pit, Pit 9, which was only partially exposed in the north-western part of the Ε quarter. Pit 9 had been subsequently cut through by Pit 8. It extended to the NE beyond the area of the trench, to the NW below Wall 4, and to the S below Wall 2 as well as below Wall 7 and the Classical paving to its W. The contents of the pit were excavated as unit 59; a small part of the pit, however, was not in the Ε quarter but in the south sector, where the fill was designated unit 60. The pit was excavated in four vertical passes. The fill comprised many small stones and roof-tile fragments within a dark, loose-textured, earth, resembling the contents of Pit 7 (see below). The latest identifiable pottery was of Classical date, although a few fragments of BA date and fewer of the EIA were also encountered.®4 The bottom of the pit was reached at a depth of 3.89-3.90m bd. The small part of the pit exposed in the south sector of the trench was slightly more shallow, its bottom having been reached at 3.70m bd. Cleaning conducted around the Ε edge of Pit 9 revealed one further possible wall, labelled Wall 11 (fig. 18). The wall was first encountered at a depth of 3.72m bd, while by the end of the season its base had not been reached.95 The part of the wall so far exposed was cut and damaged by Pit 9 and, to be precise, only four blocks belonging to it were visible at the conclusion of the 1988 campaign. The SW/NE orientation of the wall suggests that it is perhaps the continuation of Wall 8 revealed in the south sector, although further excavation is needed for its proper definition. The south sector of TR 68 is a direct continuation of the Ε quarter of TR 67 excavated in 1986, where an important stratigraphical sequence had been partially revealed.96 It was hoped that the excavation of the south sector would provide a large enough area free of later remains, in which we could extend the digging and test the stratigraphical sequence. Although important prehistoric architectural remains were exposed in it by the end of the season, the process of excavation was slowed down considerably by the stratigraphie difficulties encountered. Clearance of the topsoil and of a small amount of tumble quickly revealed a carefully paved area covering a great part of the sector, horizontally defined by Walls 1 and 2 (fig. 19). The material encountered directly above of the paving was designated unit 3 and yielded largely post-Byzantine pottery along with a smaller quantity of Classical and Hellenistic sherds, as well as a few BA and EIA scraps of pottery.97 The paving was found at a depth of 2.37-2.50m bd; it continued to the S as far as TR 67, where it was cleared in 1986.9* The flagstones of the paving, largely schist but containing a smaller admixture of limestone and a little granodiorite, were lifted as unit 5. Some ten fragments of post-Byzantine pottery were recorded in the process, while it was shown that several fragments of a large perirrhanterion (some joining), and fragments of a pithos (or other large vessel) were also incorporated into the paving. Below the paving a layer of brown earth encountered over the entire south sector was designated unit 6. Its clearance brought to light a confusing number of features horizontally distinct from one another.99 The main feature was a clay surface which in the SE half of the sector was particularly hard-packed. Its off-white colour was largely due to the presence of lime in its make-up; the matrix of this part of the floor 94 Three very small sherds, possibly from Late Roman amphorae are best seen as contamination from Pit 8. 9,5 The lowest point reached was at 3.82m bd. 96 Rep. 1986, 202ff. 97 Two fragments of glass were also recorded as well as a modern Greek coin (inv. M88.46). 98 Rep. 1986, 203. At one point along the SW scarp of the trench, 1.12-2.04m from the S corner, a small area of hard-packed clay was encountered overlying the paving (fig. 19). It may represent all that is preserved of an overlying surface largely eroded away. 99 Although a small quantity of earlier wares was recorded from unit 6, the largest component of pottery was clearly post-Byzantine.</page><page sequence="30">122 A.

In the NW part of the sector the floor continued (designated unit 18), but was here characterized by a hard-packed, brown to light brown clay, lacking the lime and pebbles of the floor to the SE. Located near the SW side of the trench, and dug through the floor units 17 and 18, was the first of many pits uncovered in the trench, some of which have already been discussed. This pit. Pit 1 (fig. 20), was roughly oval in plan and had a maximum length of 0.88m. The cutting itself was 0.38m deep and the bottom of the pit was at a depth of 2.93m bd. The upper level of its fill, unit 7, was a very loose-textured, light-coloured ashy earth. At a similar level, immediately to the WSW and overlying the floor units 17 and 18, was an ash lens, unit 9. The lower fill of the pit, unit 8 and excavated in two vertical passes, lacked the ashy debris of the upper fill. A great deal of animal bone, some charcoal, and a small quantity of fragmentary pottery, mostly post-Byzantine, was recovered from it.100 100 Among the identifiable material, there were SO fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery, one scrap of Classical black-glaze and one prehistoric fragment; 6.02kg of roof-tile fragment» were also contained in the unit.</page><page sequence="31">Excavations at Torone, 1988 123 Fig. 20. TR 68. Pit no. 1, plan and section. Fig. 21. TR 68. Pit no. 6, plan and section. Toward the NE the hard surface of unit 17 tended to peter out; in its place a loose-textured brown earth appeared along the SW face of Wall 2. This was designated unit 10, and was initially thought to represent a foundation trench for Wall 2. Further excavation, however, revealed a hearth and two further pits, and it would appear that these features were associated with the floor units 17 and 18 and that they predate the construction of Wall 2. During the excavation of unit 10, in a small strip along the SW face of Wall 2, a hearth was uncovered at a point near the NW end of the wall, which is later.101 Designated unit 12, the hearth comprised a central, oval, part of reddish-coloured fired clay measuring 0.62m in length surrounded by loose ashy soil. In addition to animal bones, sea shells, and charcoal (the latter included some fairly large pieces), three iron nails were found in the unit and a small piece of bronze, perhaps from a piece of jewellery. Excavation of the hearth revealed the fire-pit, which was also oval, with a maximum length of 0.80m; this was designated Pit 3. The cutting itself was only 0.15m deep and was filled by a brown to dark brown earth, rather loose-textured, designated unit 14. A chipped stone tool (inv. 88.31) was recovered from this shallow fill and also an unidentified iron object (inv. M88.65) and a silver Ottoman coin (inv. M88.59); the largest component of the small quantity of fragmentary pottery was post-Byzantine, although smaller quantities of earlier wares were also noted. Immediately to the SE of the hearth the earth of unit 10 became slightly darker in colour and was labelled unit ll.102 Subsequent removal of a few centimetres of soil quickly brought to light Pit 2. This was a small but comparatively deep pit (diam. 0.42m, depth 0.99m).10 Its fill, unit 13, was characterized by a very loose dark brown earth. In addition to a good quantity of organic material, among which pieces of eggshell and sea-urchin were conspicuous, the fill yielded pieces of mortar, slag, several iron nails, and another silver Ottoman coin (inv. M88.60). Among the fragmentary pottery recovered, post-Byzantine sherds predominated, although, once more, earlier wares were also recorded. The subsequent excavation of the surface units 17-18 revealed similarly confusing conditions.104 The main unit was designated unit 19 and was characterized by a compact clay matrix, reddish-brown in colour, which extended over most of the area of the south sector. It was unclear whether unit 19 was a sub-floor Unit 10 yielded 42 fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery, five small fragments of black-glaze and two painted sherds, perhaps of Geometric date. The unit also yielded a Late Roman bronze coin (inv. M88.53). 102 Units 10 and 11 are best seen as part of the same deposit. 103 The bottom of the pit was reached at a depth of 3.56m bd. 104 The excavation of the floor unit 17 yielded 42 fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery, at least 30 fragments of Classical black-glaze, 7 fragments of Late Roman amphorae, and a bronze pin (inv. M88.70). The corresponding unit 18 yielded 32 fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery, 25 black-glaze fragments, 13 fragments of Late Roman amphorae, 2 BA sherds, 2 fragments of glass, and a fragmentary bronze ring (inv. M88.69).</page><page sequence="32">124 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos packing for the surface labelled units 17-18, or represented the remains of an earlier surface.105 Toward the S, the tops of a number of stones began to appear, while a pit or, more probably, a depression in unit 19 was encountered along the SW side of the trench, at a distance of approximately 2.50m from its S corner. It was designated Pit 4 and excavated as unit 20. Its fill was a loose, dark-coloured earth contrasting with the clayey matrix of unit 19 and yielded only a very small quantity of sherds, among which some were identified as Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine. The pit was roughly rectangular in shape, with a maximum length of 1.24m, an average width of 0.34m, and a depth of 0.23m. Unit 19 yielded a good quantity of pottery of various dates. Although fragments of BA, Classical or Hellenistic, and Roman pottery were encountered, the largest component was again Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine. The deposit also yielded five fragments of glass, a piece of bronze wire (inv. M88.78), and a stamped amphora handle (inv. 88.81). The clearance of unit 19 revealed a further set of deposits, horizontally distinct from one another. In the NW part of the sector yet another floor surface was encountered, designated unit 21. It was composed of a hard-packed clay, resembling that of unit 19, but bright red in colour. This was a fairly thin floor level, the clearance of which brought to light the small continuation of Wall 4 in the south sector already described. In the area immediately around the block set upright over the top of Wall 4, the red clayey matrix continued below unit 21, where it was designated unit 23 (see above), while to the SW a deposit of brown earth of medium compaction, designated unit 24, underlay unit 21. As already noted, the latest identifiable material from units 21 and 23 was Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine. Similarly, the latest identifiable material from the underlying unit 24 was of Late- or post-Byzantine date, although earlier material was also recovered, including a stamped amphora handle (inv. 88.124). In the SE part of the sector, clearance of unit 19 revealed a thick layer of stones, described by the excavator as a stone pile; this was designated unit 26. The deposit was thickest toward the NE, where it was cleared to a depth of O.SOm, became thinner toward the SW, and did not extend quite as far as the border between TR 68 and 67. It yielded five rubber buckets of pottery, which included 23.07kg of roof-tile fragments. The pottery and other small finds were again of varying dates, with the latest identifiable material belonging to the post-Byzantine period including a Nuremberg token(?) dating to the 17th(?) cent. AD (inv. M88.85) and the stem of a clay tobacco pipe (inv. 88.142). Of the earlier material we mention only two fragments, a body sherd of a West Slope Ware vessel (inv. 88.208) and a stamped amphora handle (inv. 88.92; pi. 34: 8). At a level similar to that of unit 26, but encountered for only a short distance along the SW side of the trench, was unit 27. Although poorly preserved, this unit appears to be the remains of a floor surface partly composed of stones laid flat and partly of sea-worn pebbles set in a matrix of packed clay. The very small quantity of pottery recovered during the excavation of unit 27 comprised roughly equal proportions of Late- or post-Byzantine fragments on the one hand and Classical on the other. Largely located beneath the stones of unit 26 was unit 28. This deposit was characterized by a very dark, loose-textured soil, containing some stone. The latest pottery recovered from it was again Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine.106 The clearance of units 24, 27, and 28 did little to clarify the extremely difficult stratigraphy, and subsequently three further horizontally distinct deposits were exposed. Underlying units 26 and 28 was unit 31; its colour, texture, and composition was almost identical to that of unit 28 and the two are best seen as part of the same deposit, even though unit 31 extended over a somewhat greater area than unit 28. The latest material recovered from unit 31 was post-Byzantine, including a silver Ottoman coin (inv. M88.89). Together with this, however, the deposit did yield a quantity of earlier material, including the stone gutta inv. 88.134 (fig. 23a) thought to derive from the Temple of Athena mentioned by Thucydides,107 as well as some fragments of EIA and Late Geometric to Archaic date. Underlying unit 24 and partly overlying unit 32 (see below) was unit 34. This deposit represents the fill of the cutting through Wall 4.108 At a slightly lower level this same deposit was designated unit 45. Largely located below unit 27, but extending over a somewhat larger area, covering approximately the SW third of the south sector, was unit 32.109 This deposit was characterized by a compact, light-coloured earth, quite dense in texture. First encountered at a depth of 2.83m and extending to a depth of 3.21m bd, unit 105 The excavator favoured the latter possibility. 106 Inventoried finds from the unit include a fragment of an architectural terracotta (88.129) and a rim fragment of a glass vessel (88.133). The deposit also yielded what may be part of a human(?) jaw bone. 107 Thuc.

Seven small fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery recovered from the starting level of the upper pass of the deposit should be seen as intrusive. Small finds entered in the inventory include fragments of two architectural terracottas (inv. 88.178 and 88.179); a black-glaze fish plate preserving a complete profile (inv. 88.135)111 and a fragmentary transport amphora (inv. 88.210). In the course of the excavation of unit 24 another small, possibly natural, depression was designated 'Pit 5'. It had been dug, or had formed, into unit 32 and was almost circular in plan, with a diameter of 0.64m and a depth of only 0.18m. Its fill was cleared as unit 29, being slightly darker in colour and much looser in texture than the soil of unit 32. It yielded eleven fragments of roof tiles, one BA sherd, and ten fragments of coarse-ware vessels, two of which may be Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine. The preserved top of Wall 5 (fig. 18; see also below) was encountered with the excavation of unit 32. Clearance of this deposit, as well as of units 31 and 34, Tevealed the southern part of the large Pit 6, the eastern half of which had already been located in the Ε quarter of the trench. The other deposit exposed was unit 38, into which Pit 6 had been dug. It was the largest of the refuse pits excavated in 1988. Only its NW part was excavated in TR 68, the remainder extending beyond the SE scarp of the trench. As exposed, it has a maximum preserved length of 4.16m (E/W) and was dug to an average depth of 0.40m (fig. 21; pi. 33: 7).112 The fill of the pit was cleared in various units, subdivided into vertical passes. The upper level of the pit fill in the Ε quarter of the NE sector was designated unit 33; the corresponding upper level in the south sector was designated unit 35. The lower level of the fill in the Ε quarter was designated unit 37; that in the south sector unit 36.113 The fill of the upper level of the pit was characterized by an ashy, light-coloured, very loose-textured soil, with darker patches of fire-affected debris. The lower level was similar, but slightly darker in colour, because it lacked the ash which was present in the upper fill. A copious quantity of organic material was recovered, including animal bone, sea shell, eggshell, and charcoal. Lumps of iron and slag, pieces of mortar, and fragments of poorly fired clay were also collected. The fill also yielded eleven rubber buckets of pottery, including 59.67kg of roof-tile fragments. The largest component of the identifiable pottery recovered was of Late- or post-Byzantine date, although a good deal of earlier material was also noted.114 The late date of the fill was verified by the discovery of fragments of two post-Byzantine clay tobacco pipes (inv. 88.166 and 88.168).115 Unit 38, as noted, represents part of the pre-existing fill into which Pit 6 was cut. It was encountered around the edges of the pit in the south sector, but did not extend to the SW where unit 32 was. Unit 38 is the continuation, into the south sector, of unit 39, which Fig. 22. TR 68. Pit no. 7, plan and section, was first met in the north-east sector.116 'É S: £ οΓΐ_π_π_ Fig. 22. TR 68. Pit no. 7, plan and section. 110 The upper pass was designated unit 32 #488 and #491, the lower pass unit 32 #509-10 and #512. 111 This piece would suggest that the deposit is 4th, rather than 5th cent. BC. For the chronology of fish-plates, see Sparkes-Talcott op. cit. (η. 24) 147f. and I. McPhee-A. D. Trendall, Greek Red figured Fish-plates (1987) passim. 112 Maximum depth 0.54m. 113 The upper level of the pit fill in the Ε quarter was subdivided into four vertical passes for the purpose of establishing an arbitrary control of the recovered material. 114 A straight count of the sherds after preliminary sorting produced the following list: Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine: 242; Late Roman: 26; Classical (predominantly black-glaze): 38; PG or Geometric: 14; painted wares (mostly Classical): 22; plain or coarse wares (mostly Classical and Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine): SOI. There were, in addition, several fragments of glass. Objects entered in the inventory include, among others, an architectural terracotta (88.180), a worked bone object (§8.152), and a minuscule glass bead (88.151). 116 As noted above, unit 38-9 is probably Byzantine.</page><page sequence="34">126 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Excavation of unit 38, along with unit 32 further S, brought to light yet another large refuse pit, designated Pit 7 (fig. 22; pi. 34: 1). Since this is located at the S corner of the trench and extends into TR 67, a very small part of it had been excavated in the Ε corner of the latter in 1986.117 Like Pit 6, Pit 7 could be dug only partly because it extended beyond the trench, to the SSE. As exposed, the pit had a maximum length (S/N) of 3.20m and a maximum depth of 0.98m, although the cutting averaged a depth of about 0.70m.118 The very loose fill of Pit 7 was primarily composed of many small stones, a copious quantity of roof-tile fragments, and pottery; soil was only a minor component. A total of fifteen rubber buckets of pottery were recovered, including 117.67kg of roof-tile fragments. The fragmentary pottery ranged in date from the BA to the Classical period.119 A brief inspection of the small quantity of material recovered from Pit 7 in 1986 suggested for it a Classical or Hellenistic date. A similarly brief inspection of all the material recovered from the pit in 1986 and 1988 suggested that of the inventoried fragments the latest are best accommodated in the 2nd or 3rd quarters of the 4th cent. BC. Pieces which derive from Pit 7 include the base fragment of a MBA stemmed goblet (inv. 88.266), the body fragment of an EIA closed vessel (fig. 24), and two fragmentary black-glaze vessels (figs. 25-6). The fill also yielded another fragment of a gutta (fig. 23b), similar in size to that already mentioned but less well preserved. The cutting for Pit 7 had damaged a small part of the SW face of the earlier Wall 6 (fig. 18), and had cut through part of Wall 14 in TR 67.120 Unit 43 was encountered below units 32 and 38; it extended over most of the area of the south sector of the trench (except for those parts which had been cut by Pits 6 and 7), up to Wall 4 and the Ε face of Wall 5. The deposit was characterized by a light brown colour, and was quite compact in texture, almost clayey, with many small pebbles and chips of stone in it. The deposit was excavated in two vertical passes; the latest material recovered from it was of Classical date and included fragments of red-figure, black-glaze, plain and cooking pottery; a smaller quantity of Archaic, PG and BA sherds was also noted. Clearance of this deposit brought to light the small paved area partially encountered in the Ε quarter of the NE sector (fig. 18) and an associated hard-packed clay floor (unit 47) where the paving was not encountered (pi. 34: l).121 The very small area between the W face of Wall 5 and the SW side of the trench was excavated as unit 46. In spite of the limited area, the deposit yielded a comparatively large quantity of Classical pottery and fragments of roof tiles. Wall 5 itself is oriented NW/SE. Its preserved top was first encountered at a depth of 2.89m bd, its base at a depth of between 3.27 and 3.40m. The wall was constructed of small to medium limestone blocks, with an admixture of schist, bonded with mud; individual stones were either unworked or only roughly hewn. Toward the S the wall was not preserved and no trace of it was encountered in the Ε quarter of TR 67. To the Ν it extends below the later Wall 1. Wall 5 is on an alignment parallel to that of Wall 7 in TR 68 (fig. 18), and Wall 8 in TR 67.122 Walls 1 and 5 appear to belong to the same structure or, at least, are connected by the paved area and floor surface (unit 47) mentioned above. The paving partly hid the lower part of the W face of Wall 7. The floor unit 47 was mostly encountered to the S and SW of the paving; it was clearly dug through toward the SE by the cutting for Pit 7; unit 47 is therefore earlier than Pit 7. Its make-up was a hard-packed Fig. 23. TR 68.

It would now seem clear that unit 32 overlay Pit 7; this deposit was not encountered in the H quarter of TR 67. Pit 7 was, however, dug through unit 43 (see below), which is also Classical and identical to that encountered in the Ε quarter of TR 67. 121 The paving was encountered at a depth of 3.36m, the associated floor (unit 47) at 3.30m bd. 122 Rep. 1986, ill. 12.</page><page sequence="35">Excavations at Torone, 1988 127 Fig. 24.

The latest identifiable material recovered from it was Classical, and consisted of too small and too fragmentary pieces to permit a closer dating. Below unit 47 a deposit not unlike unit 43, in colour and texture, was encountered. Designated unit 49, it extended over most of the area of the south sector of the trench except where it had been dug away by the cuttings for Pits 6 and 7. It is best seen as a sub-floor packing or levelling fill on which the floor unit 47 was laid. Its clearance yielded only a very small quantity of identifiable pottery; the latest fragments were Classical, but could not be dated more precisely. It also brought to light the preserved top of Wall 6 (fig. 18). The latter effectively divided the south sector into two parts which, as a matter of course, were excavated separately. In the area between the SW side of the trench and the SW face of Wall 6 a thin deposit of compact earth, slightly darker than the overlying unit 49, with patches of black and red, was 123 encountered. Designated unit 50, it yielded only a very small quantity of pottery, including the rim fragment of a LH I cup (inv. 88.253, fig. 27). A few fragments of handmade BA vessels were also noted, predominantly of EBA types. The deposit also yielded at least one fragment of a Classical black-glaze drinking vessel and at least five roof-tile fragments. Fig. 27. Rim fr. of Mycenaean vessel (inv. 88.253). 1:2. Fig. 24.

Papadopoulos In the area NE of Wall 6, clearance of unit 49 brought to light unit 51 and the continuation of Wall 7.1 Unit 51 was characterized by a fairly compact, brown to light brown stoney earth, very similar to unit 49 and best seen as a continuation of it. Unit 51 did contain what appeared to be traces of decayed sun-dried mud brick. The latest pottery recovered from this deposit was again Classical and included at least eight black-glaze fragments. The deposit also contained some 5kg of roof-tile fragments and a small quantity of EIA and Β A sherds. Unit 51 was located below the cutting for Pit 6, but had been dug through by the cutting for Pit 7. Clearance of the deposit better defined the NE face of Wall 6, in addition to bringing to light the preserved top of Wall 8 (fig. 18). Wall 8 was first encountered at a depth of 3.53-3.58m bd; it consists of one schist and two limestone blocks, which are bonded with mud and have a SSW/NNE orientation. To the NE the wall extends below the base of Wall 2; the few blocks designated Wall 11, first encountered at a depth of 3.72m bd, may represent the continuation of Wall 8 into the NE sector of the trench, but this might only be established by further excavation.125 To the SSW Wall 8 appears to terminate neatly at the NE face of Wall 6; at this point the preserved single course of Wall 8 is at a fractionally higher level than that of Wall 6, but it may have originally abutted a second course of Wall 6 that has not survived. The continuation of Wall 7 in the south sector is represented by only four limestone blocks defining the W face of the wall. Wall 7 continues over the top of Wall 6 and, almost certainly, over Wall 8, although in the case of the latter the relationship is obscured by the later Wall 2.126 Wall 6 was exposed over the entire length of the south sector, oriented SE/NW. It has a preserved length of 4.66m but continues in both directions: to the NW below the later Wall 1, to the SE into the scarp of the trench. It has an average width of 0.64-0.70m. The preserved top of the wall was first encountered at a depth of between 3.30-3.59m bd; its base lies at a depth of 3.84m. It survives up to two courses, with the upper course set slightly in from the lower, a feature, especially visible along the SW face, which might suggest rebuilding. The construction was of small to medium stones bonded with mud. Roughly equal quantities of limestone and schist were used for the upper course, while schist predominated in the lower course. Part of the SW face of the wall towards the SE was damaged by the cutting for Pit 7, while the cutting for Pit 9 damaged a small part of its NE face.127 The subsequent excavation of the south sector was confined to the area SW of Wall 6. The stratigraphie sequence encountered below unit 50 was as follows: Unit 53 represented a distinct deposit from unit 50, being clayey and quite compact, with many small stones. Traces of decayed sun-dried mud brick were noticed throughout the unit. It was subsequently shown to represent material which had accumulated over the floor surface designated unit 54. Of the small quantity of fragmentary pottery recovered from unit 53, most sherds were of BA handmade vessels, although four small fragments with painted decoration are possibly of EIA date. There was also one glazed fragment of Classical date, perhaps intrusive. Unit 54 was the hard-packed, light brown clay matrix of a floor, which contained many sea-worn pebbles. Some small fragments of sea shell, including sea-urchin, were also noted in its make-up. The floor is the continuation of that exposed in the Ε quarter of TR 67 in 1986, which was associated with Walls 14 and 15, and into which two pithoi had been set, the bases of which were found in situ.128 The part of the floor that was exposed in TR 67 overlay Walls 16 and 9. Of the two pithoi mentioned above one was largely located in TR 68; only part of it was visible in 1986, in the scarp separating the two trenches. Excavation at this point in 1988 showed that the preserved base of the pithos was set into a small, roughly circular cutting in the floor unit 54 and that it was supported by a packing of yellow-coloured mud. This packing was excavated separately as unit 56. Recovered from it was a very small quantity of animal bone and sea shell, as well as seven small sherds. Of the latter, five were pieces of Β A handmade vessels and included 124 The starting level for unit 51 was 3.45m, its closing level 3.60-3.61m bd. The preserved top of the continuation of Wall 7 in the south sector (fig. 18) was first encountered at a depth of 3.40-3.48m bd. As illustrated on fig. 18 blocks designated Wall 11 do not appear to line up exactly with Wall 8. Only small parts of the two walls were exposed and therefore we could not be absolutely certain about their alignment. 126 The fill of that part of Pit 9 located in the south sector of the trench was designated unit 60 and was encountered below unit 51. The architectural relationship of Wall 6 to the small structure represented by Walls 9 and 10 in TR 68 and Wall 16 in TR 67 is discussed below. 128 Rep. 1986, 204 with n. 72. The preserved upper part of the pithos that was found in situ was encountered at a depth of 3.45m bd; its base was at a depth of 3.79m</page><page sequence="37">Excavations at Torone, 1988 129 a leg of a tripod cauldron, a shape very rare in BA Macedonia, but popular at Torone during the EIA, if not earlier.1 Two small sherds with painted decoration were also recorded, but await closer study. Clearance of the make-up of the floor unit 54 yielded only ten sherds, all from Β A handmade vessels. Thus, the 1988 excavation in TR 68 did not add evidence about the date of the floor to that obtained in the 1986. Therefore, all that can be said at present is that the floor is clearly pre-Classical and that it dates to either the LB A or the EIA, as suggested by the presence of at least one Mycenaean sherd in its clay matrix found in the Ε quarter of TR 67 in 1986.1 0 The appearance after the removal of unit 54 of the preserved top of Wall 9, oriented SW/NE, dictated the excavation of the material on either side of it separately. The first deposit to the SE was designated unit 55; that to the NW unit 57. The two were similar in their composition: their soil was of brown to light brown colour, compact and clayey in texture, and contained traces of decayed sun-dried mud brick throughout. Clearance of unit 55 defined more clearly the SE face of Wall 9 and its junction with Wall 16 in TR 67 (fig. 18). The unit yielded fourteen fragments of Β A pots, the latest of which seemed to be Middle Helladic. The excavation of unit 57 defined better the internal faces of Wall 9 and Wall 16 in TR 67, and brought to light Wall 10 (fig. 18; pi. 34: 2). The excavation of the south sector was terminated at a hard-packed clay floor surface encountered in the small internal area defined by Walls 9 and 10 in TR 68 and Wall 16 in TR 67. The latest identifiable pottery recovered from unit 57 appeared to be of Middle Helladic date, although three fragments may possibly be of Late Bronze or EIA date. The floor was encountered at a depth of 3.64m bd. The small structure defined by Wall 16 in TR 67 and Walls 9 and 10 in TR 68 was the earliest architectural unit uncovered in 1988. The three walls are stone socles for a mud-brick structure as suggested by remains of decayed sun-dried mud brick noted in the overlying levels. Wall 16 in TR 67, oriented SE/NW, was first encountered at a depth below datum varying between 3.48 and 3.67m; its base, exposed in the eastern quarter of the trench, lies at a depth of 3.74m bd. The wall was constructed of small to medium unworked or roughly hewn stones, bonded with mud. An admixture of schist and limestone was used, with the former predominating. The wall has a preserved length of 1.80m and an average width of about 0.50m. Associated with it are several red-coloured mud bricks found by its NE face near the junction with Wall 9. An interesting feature of this wall and Walls 9 and 10 in TR 68 was that several large sea shells, some in situ, were used in their construction. Bonded with Wall 16 and defining the S corner of the structure was Wall 9. Oriented SW/NE, the preserved top of the wall was first encountered at a depth of 3.54-3.61m bd; its base was not revealed. The wall has a length of 1,80m and a width slightly under 0.50m. The construction of Wall 9 was similar to that of Wall 16. At least one mud brick was encountered along its NW face. The preserved top of Wall 10, oriented SE/NW, was encountered at a depth below datum varying between 3.43 and 3.63m. The wall has a maximum width of 0.58m and a preserved length of 2.22m; it is clear, however, that it continued toward the NW. The construction of Wall 10 also was similar to that of Wall 16, with several large sea shells used as packing among the stones, and with several mud bricks along its SW face. Walls 9 and 10 are bonded to each other and define the Ε corner of the small structure. The NE face of Wall 10 is flush against the lower course of the SW face of Wall 6. The more precise dating of the small architectural unit defined by Walls 16, 9, and 10 within the Β A can only be established by the excavation of its internal floor surface and the study of the underlying deposits. A preliminary study of the small quantity of pottery recovered from the level immediately above its floor (unit 57) showed that it included Middle Helladic sherds. The fact, however, that this structure was subsequently built over by the floor associated with Walls 14 and 15 inTR 67, which, as noted above, dates either to the LBA or to the EIA, indicates that it should be dated either to the MBA or to the LBA. 129 For another leg of a tripod cooking vessel, from TR 72, see infra n. 147.

Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos 132 It is also worth noting that Wall 16, largely exposed in 1986, overlies the EBA deposits encountered in the Ε quarter of TR 67. It has been mentioned above that the lower course of Wall 6 is at the same level with and flush against the NE face of Wall 10; it should, therefore, be contemporary with it. The second, upper, course of Wall 6 was set slightly in from the lower and appears to represent a rebuilding at a time when the structure formed by Walls 9, 10, and 16 had fallen in disuse. The date of this rebuilding remains problematic, especially because of the disturbance caused by Pits 7 and 9, but is perhaps similar to that of Walls 14 and 15 in TR 67 and their associated floor which seemed to extend up to the SW face of the upper course of Wall 6. « The exposed parts of Walls 8 and 11 were too small to provide any reliable information about their relationship with the walls described above. It is hoped that further excavation in 1989 will clarify the existing chronological problem. TRENCH 72 (Figs. 28-31; Pis. 34: 3-5) TR 72 was laid out to the NW as a 5.0m square, at a distance of 1.70m from TR 67 (figs, 2-3). The irregularity of the baulk separating the two trenches was largely dictated by a series of late walls visible above ground surface in this area prior to excavation (Walls 1-3). The discovery of a large constructed tomb in the centre of the trench (fig. 28) limited the space in which it was possible to explore earlier cultural phases. Of all the trenches excavated in 1988, TR 72 was the only one in which bedrock was reached, at various points, at depths ranging between 3.59 and 3.92m bd. Thus it was shown that the level of the natural rock rises considerably in this part of the promontory.133 Of the three walls visible above ground prior to excavation only the NE face of Wall 1 was located within the trench; the other two lay in the unexcavated SE and NW baulks. Wall 1 was traced for a length of almost 3.00m, oriented SE/ NW. The wall was constructed of an admixture of unworked or only roughly hewn pieces of limestone, schist and granodiorite; it survives up to two courses. To the NW it appears to be bonded with Wall 2, although the junction does not define a perfect right angle, while towards the SE it may continue up to Wall 3. Wall 2, oriented NE/SW and running close to the NW scarp of the trench, was of similar construction to Wall 1. The wall has a maximum length of 2.66m, but does not continue towards the NE, and a width of 0.64-0.80m. Towards the SW it survives to several courses, towards the NE only to one. Wall 3, running the entire length of the trench close to the SE scarp, forms the NW wall of the building to which Walls 1 and 2 in TR 67 and 1 and 3 in TR 68 belong. Wall 3 is also of similar dry-rubble construction; towards the SW it survives up to at least seven courses of neatly jointed, but not very regular masonry, while towards the NE it survives only to a single course (pi. 34: 3).

Elsewhere in the excavated area bedrock was not reached and may lie at k level deeper than 5.0m bd.</page><page sequence="39">Excavations at Torone, 1988 131 Fig. 29. TR 72. NE face of Wall 4.

Papadopoulos Excavation of the trench was therefore defined by these three walls and by the NE scarp. Clearance of topsoil, unit 2, brought to light a layer of stone tumble, unit 3, overlying the entire area under excavation.134 Clearance of the tumble revealed a tile smash as well as the preserved top of Wall 4. This wall is located partly below Wall 1 and appears to extend below Wall 2 (fig. 28; pi. 34: 4). Although an admixture of limestone, schist, and granodiorite was mainly employed in its construction, there is in it a considerable use of stones cut and reused from earlier ancient blocks. The stones are bonded with lime mortar, unlike the later Walls 1-3 (fig. 29). Wall 4 is preserved up to at least four courses of masonry and in plan appears to be curved.135 The tile smash was particularly concentrated near the Ε face of Wall 4 and along the NW face of Wall 3, thinning out towards the Ν and W. The small quantity of soil between the overlying tumble and the tiles was designated unit 4; the tile smash was lifted as unit 5. Clearance of the tiles yielded a small quantity of associated pottery ranging in date from the BA to the post-Byzantine period, as well as a silver coin of Ragusa in Dalmatia dating to the 17th century (inv. M88.33) and 104kg of roof-tile fragments. Removal of the tiles quickly brought to light an anticipated floor surface. The thin deposit of earth between the tiles and the floor was designated unit 6. Recovered from it were two coins: a small Late Roman bronze issue (inv. M88.47) and a Byzantine bronze trachy (inv. M88.49) probably dating to the 13th cent. AD. The associated pottery was mixed; the latest identifiable material, and that comprising the largest component, consisted of fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery, although smaller quantities of prehistoric, Geometric, Classical, Hellenistic—including a West Slope Ware rim fragment (inv. 88.32)—, and Roman pottery were also recorded. The floor itself, composed of compacted brown earth, was designated unit 11 and is associated with Wall 3. Encountered at a depth of between 2.25 and 2.43m bd, the surface was best preserved in the centre of the trench and toward the NE; only spurious traces of it were noted in the area to the SW, near Wall 4, where two refuse pits appeared. They were designated Pits 1 and 2, and must predate the floor.136 Pit 1 was located in the S corner of the trench and extended from the NW face of Wall 3 towards Wall 4; the pit continued below Wall 3, as well as partly below Wall 4 (pi. 34: 3-4). In digging the foundation for Wall 3, the builders chanced upon the pit and decided to strengthen the wall by adding to its foundation a packing of several extra courses of masonry, thereby preventing a possible subsidence due to the loose fill of the pit.137 The maximum dimensions of Pit 1, which was roughly rectangular in plan, were 1.47 (SE/NW) χ 1.03m (SW/NE). Its fill, unit 7, was characterized by a soft, loose-textured, dark earth. At a depth of between 2.41 and 2.56m bd a layer of stones was encountered near its centre; underneath the stones, however, the soft, dark earth continued. The bottom of the pit was reached at a depth of 3.92m bd, at the level of the bedrock; the overall depth of the pit was 1.56m. Recovered from its fill was a large quantity of fragmentary pottery. The largest component of this pottery consisted of fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine plain and glazed wares, 38 although smaller quantities of BA, Archaic, Classical, and Roman pottery were also encountered.139 Small finds also include a glazed terracotta object which could be a spindlewhorl, a bead or a button (inv. L88.34), a fragment of a knife (inv. M88.118), a bronze nail (inv. M88.55), and a rim fragment of a glass vessel (inv. 88.472). Three coins were also recovered: two Byzantine bronze trachys (inv. M88.57 and M88.115) and three fragments of another bronze coin which may be Greek (inv. M88.58). A good quantity of organic material was also found including pieces of animal bone, sea shell (including sea-urchin) and eggshell. Pit 2 was located only about 0.20m NW of Pit 1. It was also roughly rectangular in plan, with a maximum length of 1.10m (SE/NW) and a width of 0.46-0.64m. The pit was flush against Wall 4, but it was unclear whether it extended below it. Its contents were cleared in three units (8-10). Unit 8 is the upper level of the fill, characterized by a soft, loose-textured, dark soil, similar to that of Pit 1. Unit 9 was a thin layer of ashy, blackened soil containing much carbon but little else. At a depth of 2.71m bd,140 Pit 2 narrowed 1 ΊΑ The collected surface sherds were designated unit 1. Two blocks towards the NW, near Wall 2, are oriented SE-NW, whereas the remaining blocks of the uppermost preserved course are oriented SSE/NNW. 136 Although the floor did not extend so far SW as the two pits, the tile smash unit 5 (along with unit 6) overlay both. 137 At this point Wall 3 survives to a height of 1.20m. (ΙΟ e.g. an almost complete closed veisel (88.452) and the neck and rim fragments of a large glazed pithos (88.453). 139 e.g. an EBA rim fragment preserving a lug handle (88.458), a body and handle fragment of a large lekane (88.413), probably of Classical date, as well as fragments of an amphora (88.499), and a cooking-ware vessel (88.500). 140 i.e. approximately 0.40m below the top of the pit.</page><page sequence="41">Excavations at Torone, 1988 133 to a circular depression measuring about 0.65m in diameter. From this point to the bottom, the fill, although similar to unit 8, assumed a somewhat more greenish tinge and was designated unit 10. The bottom of the pit was reached at a depth of 2.95m bd.141 The material recovered from Pit 2 was not unlike that from Pit 1, its largest component consisting of fragments of Late· or post-Byzantine plain and glazed wares. Smaller quantities of BA, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman sherds were also recorded and with them a few fragments of glass.142 A post-Byzantine date for the laying of the fill was confirmed by the discovery of two silver Ottoman coins (inv. M88.50 and M88.52), one of which was pierced near the edge. Following the clearing of the contents of Pits 1 and 2, it was decided to divide the trench in two halves on the basis of a NE/SW axis and to dig first the NW half. Clearance of the hard, brown-coloured, compacted earth matrix of the floor (unit 11) quickly revealed Walls 5 and 6.143 The former was first encountered at a depth of 2.30m bd, the latter at a depth of 2.45m. Parallel to one another, on a roughly SE/NW orientation, and only about 1.00m apart, the two walls were bonded at right angles to across wall. Wall 7 (fig. 28). Walls 5,6, and 7 were comparatively narrow, measuring between 0.25 and 0.43m in width. Their preserved tops were largely composed of lime mortar. The SW face of Wall 5, along with the NE face of Wall 6, appeared to be quite regular, whereas their external faces were less so. The three walls increasingly looked like the three sides of a constructed tomb, the identification of which was still to be confirmed. 44 To the NE of Wall 5 a hard-textured, yellow-brown earth containing many small pebbles was encountered below unit 11 and was designated unit 13. With greater depth reached, the exterior (NE) face of Wall 5 was shown to be quite irregular, suggesting that the structure was intended to be below ground level. Toward the Ν corner of the trench another pit was uncovered, dug into the earth of unit 13. Designated Pit 3, it was first met at a depth of 2.45m bd. Its fill, unit 14, was a loose-textured soil, somewhat darker in colour than that of unit 13. The bottom of Pit 3 was at a depth of 2.71m bd. The cutting for the pit, which had a maximum diameter of 0.80m, was dug deeper toward the NW, where it had an overall depth of 0.24m, and shallower toward the SE, where it was only 0.15m deep. Its contents, like those of Pits 1 and 2, yielded mixed pottery, mostly preserved in small fragments, the latest material clearly being of Late- or post-Byzantine date.14 The fragmentary pottery and other small finds recovered from unit 13 were also mixed and of similar late date. This deposit also yielded a small bronze coin, much worn, tentatively identified as Late Roman by N. Hardwick. Further cleaning in the area of the Ν corner of the trench better defined the SE face of Wall 8 (fig. 28).146 It had originally been anticipated that Wall 2 would continue toward the NE, but in its place Wall 8 was encountered, on a similar but slightly different orientation. Wall 8 runs parallel to the NW scarp of the trench for a length of 1.50m from the Ν corner. Its preserved top was first met at a depth of 2.19m bd. The wall survives mostly to a single course of undistinguished dry-rubble masonry, incorporating granodiorite, limestone, and schist blocks; it has an average width of 0.40m. . In the area to the SW of Wall 6, a deposit identical in colour, texture, and consistency to unit 13 was excavated as unit 17. As with unit 13, the fragmentary pottery and the other small finds varied chronologically. The latest material again dated to the Late- or post-Byzantine period, although there was a greater quantity of Classical and Hellenistic sherds, including the body fragment of a red-figure krater 141 i.e. its overall depth w»« 0.74m. 14Î Only a very small portion of the pottery recovered was entered in the inventory: 88.44, 88.45, and 88.220 (Late- or poit-Byzantine glazed vessels), 88.398 (EBA body fr. with lug handle), and 88.38 (small body fr. West Slope Ware). 141 The small finds recovered from unit 11 were of mixed date and included BA, PG, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, and Late- or post-Byzantine pottery. A post-Byzantine date for the floor was confirmed by the discovery of a fragment of a Turkish clay tobacco-pipe bowl (88.69). Of the various pottery pieces entered in the inventory, one consists of three joining fragments of a red-figure krater (88.112) dating to the 2nd half of the Sth cent. BC. It should be noted that one of these fragments was retrieved from unit 15, from the area between Walls 5 and 6 (see below). 144 The structure comprising Walls 5, 6, and 7 was initially labelled Feature 1, but subsequently referred to as Tomb 1. 145 Twenty-one sherds of Late- or post-Byzantioe pottery were recovered. Earlier material included small fragments of BA, Classical, and Roman pottery. Selected fragments entered in the inventory include: 88.40S (perhaps from a vessel of MBA date); 88.93 (base fr. of black-glaze vessel); 88.97 (small, painted body fr.). 146 The deposits here were designated units 16, 19, and 20. Unit 16 refers to topsoil and is the same as unit 2; unit 19 refers to the layer of stone tumble (= unit 3) and unit 20 refers to the floor (= unit 11). Worth noting here is a Byzantine bronze trachy (M88.80) recovered from unit 20 and perhaps dating to the 13th century. Unit 12, not previously mentioned, refers to cleaning conducted in the area especially above and around Wall 3.</page><page sequence="42">134 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos (inv. 88.317, pi. 34: 7), the rim and neck fragments of a West Slope Ware amphora (inv. 88.164), and a stamped amphora handle (inv. 88.322A).147 Excavation of unit 17 also brought to light, in the angle between Walls 2 and 6, another small pit or, more probably, just a natural depression. Designated Pit 4, it had a maximum diameter of 0.40m and a depth of no more than 0.12m; its bottom was reached at a depth of 2.62m bd. Its fill was cleared as unit 18 and yielded only 23 very small pottery fragments. The few identifiable sherds appeared to be of Classical date. The soil below unit 11 in the area between Walls S and 6 was of softer texture and darker colour than that of units 13 and 17 and contained, in its uppermost level, many small stones. This deposit was designated unit 15. As with units 13 and 17, the pottery and other small finds recovered from unit 15 were of mixed dates. The latest identifiable material was Late- or post-Byzantine, although fragments of BA, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman pottery were also recorded.148 Inventoried small finds other than pottery include a worked flint (88.77), a fragment of a terracotta figurine (88.91), a fragment of red-painted wall plaster (88.108), a small bead of unidentified substance (88.123), and an iron knife (M88.76). Several fragments of glass were noted but not inventoried, and 69.07kg of roof-tile fragments were also recovered from the unit. .U/S3K LEVELS BELOW SITE DATUM VIS 314 LEVELS BELOW SITE DATUM Fig. 31. TR 72. Tomb 1. Plan of human remains, in situ. ! At a depth of 3.18m bd, various human bones were encountered in a state of disarray, supporting the tentative identification of the structure defined by Walls 5, 6, and 7 as a tomb. It was therefore decided to extend the area under excavation to the SE, between Walls 5 and 6, in an attempt to define the overall dimensions of the structure. This extension soon revealed Wall 9, parallel to Wall 7, being bonded at right angles to Walls S and 6 (fig. 28; pi. 34: 3-5). An important feature of this wall is that it preserves two steps, both with a plaster surfacing on their upper faces. The top step was encountered at a depth of 2.61m bd. It was by now clear that the structure was a tomb, with steps giving access to it from the ESE. The external dimensions of the tomb are 3.00 (SE/NW) χ 1.75m (SW/NE); its internal dimensions are 2.10 χ 1.00m. Its construction incorporated many large well-dressed blocks reused from ancient buildings. These 147 Other finds include a black-glaze handle fragment (88.98) and a leg fragment of a tripod cooking vessel (88.356). 148 e.g. miniature Corinthian kotyle fr. 88.132; fr. black-glaze askos(?) 88.84; small fr. West Slope Ware 88.85.</page><page sequence="43">Excavations at Torone, 1988 135 149 larger blocks were levelled up with smaller stones, predominantly schist, and bonded with lime mortar. A curious feature of the tomb was located at its NW end: at a depth of 3.09-3.20m bd, what was at first thought to be the floor of the tomb was encountered. It consisted of several stones set in substantial lime mortar (fig. 31) and extended to a maximum distance of only 0.39m from the internal face of Wall 7; therefore it must be a kind of ledge, perhaps meant to be used as a setting for offerings. Further clearance of unit 15 exposed more distinctly the layer with human remains. The bones were found in an extremely poor state of preservation. Quite a few among them, however, had maintained their articulation, especially a pair of feet toward the E, the position of which suggested that the burial was primary rather than secondary (fig. 31). The location of the feet toward the E, together with several larger bones, tentatively identified as leg bones, suggested an ESE/WNW orientation for the skeleton, with the head toward the WNW. It should be added, however, that the number of interred bodies will remain uncertain until the bones are studied. Among the bones various small finds were noted, which are offerings or objects of personal decoration worn by the deceased. These include an iron cross (inv. M88.87) and an iron ring (inv. M88.88), perhaps from the same object; a bronze buckle (inv. M88.94); a small bone or ivory die (inv. 88.136) and eight beads of crystal and glass (inv. 88.137 and 88.1SS). Six joining and non-joining fragments of a pot (inv. 88.173) were also retrieved, which were particularly interesting since they seemed to be of post-Late Roman date. The precise dating of the tomb, however, must await the closer study of these objects. It is worth noting that, although resembling some of the larger Late Roman tombs excavated in earlier campaigns on Terrace IV, this tomb differs from them primarily by the greater use of lime mortar.150 It should be also noted that the tomb in TR 72 resembles the structure defined by Walls 10, 11, 12, and 17 discovered in TR 67 during the 1986 campaign, not only by its masonry style but also by its orientation and its size.151 The opinion was already expressed in 1986 that the structure in TR 67 may well be a Late Roman tomb systematically cleared of its contents during the post-Byzantine period. The discovery of the tomb in TR 72 supports strongly this view. A further aspect of the tomb worth drawing attention to is the regularity of the preserved tops of its walls, suggesting the original use of large (perhaps reused) cover stones. The fact that Wall 6 is slightly higher than Wall 5 would not exclude such a possibility.15 The human remains, along with the associated kterismata in a layer of fine, loose-textured, dark earth, were cleared as unit 21. Below this a somewhat more compact, clayey deposit was met, designated unit 28. Recovered from this comparatively thin deposit were 10 fragments of Classical black-glaze pottery, some 20 fragments of plain and coarse-ware vessels predominantly, if not exclusively of Classical types, and 0.62kg of roof-tile fragments. Three small sherds which may be Late Byzantine or post-Byzantine were also noted. The largest component of the pottery, however, belongs to the BA, with a least 50 sherds, among which one could distinguish EBA and MBA types. It was during the excavation of unit 28 that the preserved top of Wall 12 first appeared at t depth of 3.21m bd. Oriented E/W, Wall 12 was exposed for a length of 1.00m and continued below Walls 5 and 7 and the associated mortar and stone ledge. The width of the wall could not be measured (fig. 28; pi. 34: 5). The wall, which is constructed of a mixture of limestone and schist slabs bonded with mud, survives to a single course of masonry. A foundation trench was traced along its S face, extending approximately 0.20m from its face. The fill of this trench was characterized by a soft, dark brown earth, with many stone chips. Designated unit 32, the fill yielded 14 fragments of Β A pottery, a rim fragment of an Ionian cup, a body fragment of a black-glaze vessel, 5 plain or coarse-ware body fragments and two roof-tile fragments. On the basis of this evidence the wall might be assigned to the Classical or the Hellenistic period? 149 W»ll 5 lurvivei to a height of 0.84m; Wall 6 to a height of 0.80m; Walls 7 and 9 to 0.7S and 0.57m respectively. 150 A.

This would explain the pretence of the fragmentary and mixed pottery and the state of disarray of the human remaint along with the broken fragments of the pot inv. 88.173. 153 Of these fragments 9 were entered in the inventory (88.369-370, 376-382). 154 Such a date appears to be corroborated by the orientation of Wall 12, which is similar to that of the Classical or Hellenistic walls in TR 67-9.</page><page sequence="44">136 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Below unit 28, and below the bases of the walls of the tomb, compact, multi-coloured earth was met containing traces of yellow, brown, red, and black coloration, evidently the result of decayed sun-dried mud brick. The excavation of this earth, designated unit 30, revealed a feature located directly below Wall 6 at a distance from the junction of Walls 6 and 9 of approximately 0.55m (pi. 34: 5). First encountered at a depth of 3.25m bd, this feature was constructed of three large fragments of tiles, set on edge at right angles to each other to form a box or cist. Smaller fragments of tiles and small stones were placed around the larger tiles on the Ν and W sides as supports. Only the northern part of this feature was exposed in the area under excavation, since its southern part extended below Wall 6. In plan the feature has a width (NE/NW) of 0.46m and a maximum exposed length of 0.40m. It resembles tile burials, common in the Greek world from the Classical period on, and is not unlike several burials of this type excavated during earlier campaigns on Terrace IV.15S No trace, however, of human remains was encountered within the small area defined by the tiles and therefore its identification as a grave must remain tentative.156 The largest component of pottery recovered from unit 30 consisted of EBA and MBA fragments, the former were predominant. Also worth noting is an obsidian flake (inv. 88.195). At least seven fragments of PG and Geometric pottery were also recorded, in addition to a small quantity of Classical sherds. At a depth of 3.48m bd a surface of packed mud was encountered immediately to the SE of the feature constructed with tiles, which was actually set in it. Only a very small portion of this surface was preserved, measuring in plan approximately 0.65 χ 0.40m, and extending below the base of Wall 6 (pi. 34: 5). Near the centre of the surface as preserved, a small circular depression, 0.21m in diameter, was noticed, resembling a post hole. The dark brown, soft-textured, fill of the depression, contrasting to the compact, light-coloured mud surface was excavated as unit 49. It proved to be only 3cm deep.157 The deposit toward the NE and NW of the packed mud floor (still within the area defined by the walls of the tomb) was dug as unit 37. Although not unlike the overlying unit 30, it had a somewhat more pronounced multi-coloured appearance clearly due to the presence of decayed sun-dried mud bricks and mere clay. This deposit overlay bedrock which was encountered at depths varying between 3.59 and 3.78m bd. The pottery fragments recovered from unit 37 were almost exclusively of Β A date, although two sherds may possibly be PG.158 Other small finds included as well as a stone pounder (inv.88.237) an obsidian blade and a flint tool (inv. 88.367 and 88.416 respectively). Since bedrock had been reached within the area defined by the walls of the tomb, it was decided to continue digging in the remaining areas of the trench to the SW and NE. In the area to the SW of Wall 6, clearance of unit 17 was continued, especially towards the SE near Wall 3.159 Excavation here was terminated at a depth of 2.53m bd. Excavation of the area NE of the tomb was less straightforward. The removal of unit 13 brought to light three deposits horizontally distinct from one another. These were designated units 22, 23, and 25. Unit 22 was, in plan, a roughly triangular area in the angle formed by Walls 5 and 8 (fig. 28) and was characterized by a compact yellow-brown earth. Unit 23 was a dark, almost black, soft-textured soil, and contained much ash debris. It was located to the SE of unit 22, extending from the central part of Wall 5 to the line of stones designated Wall 10. In the remainder of the area toward the NE scarp of the trench, a brown-coloured earth of medium compaction was met, designated unit 25. A preliminary study of the material recovered from these deposits indicated that the latest identifiable pottery from unit 25 was post-Byzantine, while that from unit 22 was predominantly, if not exclusively, Classical or earlier.16" The very small quantity of sherds recovered from unit 23 was mostly uninformative. Clearance of units 23 and 25 revealed a hearth or oven, which explained the presence of ash debris immediately above it in unit 23. The oven consisted of a clay bedding, fired hard, encountered at a depth of 2.87m bd, onto which a layer of tile fragments were laid flat.161 In plan, the area thus defined measured For a useful survey of tile-burials in Corinth, see H. Palmer in: C. W. Blegen et al., Corinth XIII. The North Cemetery (1964) 73ff. For tile burials in the cemetery on Terrace IV of Torone, see supra n. 150. 156 The interior of the feature was excavated as unit 38. It yielded no more than 16 sherds of BA date, one amphora rim and one body fragment probably of Classical date, and 14 other non-identifiable fragments. 157 The floor surface was not excavated. 158 The number of recorded BA sherds is 173; the two sherds thought to be PG are perhaps best seen as intrusive. The lower level of the deposit was cleared as unit 41. 160 Most pottery fragments were black-glaze and Classical coarse ware, although small quantities of BA, PG, and Geometric pottery were also recorded. Unit 25 also yielded a good deal of Classical and earlier pottery, but here the latest material was clearly post-Byzantine. The layer of tiles was encountered at depths varying between 2.70 and 2.79m bd.</page><page sequence="45">Excavations at Torone, 1988 137 0.75m.162 Next to the tiles, on the Ε side, a small pit was located and labelled Pit S. It had a maximum diameter of 0.32m and a depth of only 0.09m.1 3 Its fill, cleared as unit 31, consisted of a soft, loose-textured, grey-brown ashy earth containing pieces of charcoal and sea shell.164 Further traces of blackened, fire-affected debris were encountered in the area to the Ν and NW of the oven.165 The entire installation was bounded by two poorly defined lines of stone labelled Walls 10 and ll.166 On the SE side Wall 10, oriented E/W and first encountered at a depth of 2.57m bd, was traced for a length of approximately 0.90m. Constructed of schist and limestone without the use of mortar, it has a regular face only on the Ν side, survives to a height of 0.40m, and has a maximum preserved width of 0.38m. To the W it abuts Wall 5 and is therefore later than the tomb. Parallel to Wall 10 and located at a distance of about 1.90m to the NNW was Wall 11, which consists of only a few unworked pieces of schist and limestone and survives to only a single course. The wall has a length of 0.45m and a maximum width of 0.35m; its SSE face was more regular than that to the NNW. To the W it was built up against the harder earth of unit 22. The layer of tiles in the oven was excavated as unit 27, while the underlying hard-fired clay floor was cleared as unit 36. The latest identifiable pottery from these units was of Late- or post-Byzantine date, although smaller quantities of earlier sherds were also recorded. Excavation of the compact, yellow-brown soil designated unit 22 brought to light the remnants of various floor surfaces. The first, unit 34, was encountered at a depth of 2.76m bd and was characterized by sherds and stones lying flat.167 Another surface, of similar composition, was encountered at a depth of 2.93m and designated unit 36 (the earth between the two floors was cleared as unit 35). Unit 34 was horizontally confined to the area directly below unit 22, whereas unit 36 extended to the Ν and Ε below the oven. Unit 36 was, however, best preserved in the area below units 22, 34, and 35, tending to peter out toward the NE scarp of the trench. The latest identifiable pottery recovered from units 34 and 35 was Classical, although fragments of earlier pottery, including BA and PG were also noted. Similarly, the largest component of the fragmentary pottery recovered from unit 36 was of Classical date, but this unit also contained smaller quantities of earlier material and seven small fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery. The latter are perhaps best seen as intrusive, deriving from the overlying oven. Clearance of unit 36 brought to light two deposits horizontally distinct from one another and extending over the area between Wall 5 and the NE scarp of the trench. In the NW part of this area a dark brown, loose-textured earth containing many stones was encountered and designated unit 39. Toward the SE, a hard, compact, yellow earth with almost no stones was revealed and designated unit 40. The latest identifiable sherds from unit 39 were Hellenistic, including a rim fragment of a West Slope Ware vessel (inv. 88.330); the deposit also yielded a bronze coin of Alexander the Great (inv. M88.113).168 The latest identifiable material recovered from unit 40 consisted of four small fragments of black-glaze pottery.169 Below units 39 and 40 a layer of roof tiles resembling a tile smash, intermingled with pottery, was encountered. This deposit, unit 43, was met at a depth of 2.91m bd toward the NW and at 2.98m toward the SE. The small quantity of sherds recovered from it was of Classical or earlier date.170 Clearance of unit 43 revealed remnants of a clay surface designated unit 44, along with various patches of soft and hard soil in those parts of the area where the surface was not preserved; the latter were excavated as units 45 and 46. The pottery recovered from units 44-6 was of Classical to Hellenistic or earlier date.171 Beneath this group of units another layer of roof-tile fragments intermingled with sherds was encountered, at a depth varying between 2.94 and 3.02m bd, designated unit 47. The sherds recovered from this unit were mostly fragments of plain and cooking wares. Below unit 47 a soft-textured, sandy, brown 1A2 The oven resembled another one found in TR 67 in 1986 on the floor of the building represented by Walls 1 and 2 (Rep. 1986, 198). 163 Starting level: 2.85m bd; closing level: 2.94m. 164 Twelve scraps of pottery, mostly unidentifiable, were recovered from this unit. Partly cleared as unit 33. 166 Only Wall 10 is recorded on the plan fig. 28. 167 Compare the floors of similar make-up uncovered in TR 61/2 (pi. 32: 6). Traces of a later possible floor, composed largely of pebbles set in mud, were encountered at a slightly higher level (at 2.67m bd), and cleared as part of unit 22. 168 We owe thii information to N. Hardwick. 169 Two small fragments of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery were encountered in unit 39 directly below Wall 11, while another two similar fragments were found by the Ν face of Wall 10. All four fragments almost certainly represent contamination from the construction of these later walls. 170 The latest material comprised 9 fragments of black-glaze pottery, including at least one fragment of the 4th cent. BC. Smaller quantities of BA and PG pottery were also noted. 171 Only two sherds were inventoried: 88.438 (from a figured lekythos) and 88.496 (possibly from a Chian chalice).</page><page sequence="46">138 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos deposit was cleared as unit 48. The latest material recovered here was Hellenistic, including at least two fragments of West Slope Ware. It should be mentioned immediately, however, that the largest component of the fragmentary pottery dated to the Β A.172 Traces of decayed sun-dried mud brick scattered throughout the unit were also noted, and a small lead object with relief decoration on one side was recovered (inv. M88.119). The excavation of unit 48 represents the lowest level reached in this part of the trench at the conclusion of the 1988 season. The pottery and the other small finds recovered from unit 22, and the material from the deposits underlying the oven, suggest that they represent Classical or Hellenistic levels predating the construction of the tomb. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS Although none of the trenches opened on the Lekythos in 1988 was completed and much of the material recovered awaits closer study, the results obtained so far have already greatly extended our knowledge of the various phases of occupation on the promontory and their character. This is especially true of the remains of the Classical, Hellenistic, Late Byzantine, and post-Byzantine periods. The earlier phases of occupation were not extensively explored in 1988 since few of the investigated trenches were excavated to sufficient depth. Nevertheless, the finds actually encountered in situ along with the great quantity of BA pottery and other small finds recovered from later levels, especially material of the EBA, attests the lively character of the settlement during the prehistoric era. It is hoped that further excavation in 1989, especially in TR 67, 68, and 69, will add to the impressive discoveries made in 1986, especially the discovery of the remains of the EBA burnt dwelling in TR 69.173 The excavations of 1988 were primarily concentrated in four trenches located, as in 1986, toward the SE end of the promontory (figs. 2-3). In TR 61/2 (figs. 4-12; pis. 30: 1-31: 7) the interior of a large semicircular defensive tower was cleared to the level of the original floor. The building, preserved to a height of at least 3.20m, was constructed probably during the Late Byzantine period, but a more precise date must await the closer study of the pottery and other small finds recovered from its foundation trenches and successive floor levels. The construction of its walls incorporated a mixture of limestone, granodiorite, and schist bonded with lime mortar and, in parts, faced with a finer plaster. A good many reused blocks of the Classical, and at least one of the Archaic, period were noted in the walls. The Archaic block, located near the base of Wall A, was inscribed with a single letter (pi. 31: 3), a vau or digamma of Archaic form, which is probably a mason's mark.174 The stone is important since it represents, to date, the only inscription of the Archaic period on stone discovered at Torone. The form of the letter is of more particular interest since it does not appear to be consistent with the tail-less vau that was most commonly used in Euboia and her colonies during the Archaic period and, as such, provides some new evidence for the current debate on whether Torone was indeed settled by Euboian Chalkidians.175 1 τ&gt; The 106 frs. of ΒΑ pottery await closer examination. 173 Rep. 1986, 215. 174 Cf. supra n. 25. 175 Many scholars assume that 'Chalkidike' took its name from Chalkis in Euboia and that Torone was the earliest of the 'Chalkidian' colonies (see, e.g., D. W. Bradeen, AJPh 73, 1952, 356-80; J. Boardman, The Greeks Overseas [2nd ed., 1980] 229; C. F. Edson in: B. Laourdas-Ch. Makaronas [eds.], Ancient Macedonia. Papers Read at the First International Symposium held in Thessaloniki 26-29 August 1968 [1970] 20). The opposing view, that the Chalkidians of the North were a native Greek tribe, has been argued by, among others, E. Harrison, CQ 6, 1912, 93-103, 165-78; M. Zahrnt, Olynth und die Chalkidier (1971) 12-27; S. C. Bakhuizen, Chalcis-in-Euboea (1976) 14-5; cf. also L. H. Jeffery, The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece (1961) 363-4, 369.

Ed.]</page><page sequence="47">Excavations at Torone, 1988 139 Following the period of primary use of the semicircular structure, the building was partially filled in and later reused in different capacities at various times during the course of the post-Byzantine period. Below the original floor of the tower three phases of Classical construction were explored. The earliest of these (fig. 4; pi. 30:1-3) consists of a series of wall foundations and associated floors, which should date to the 2nd half of the 5th cent. BC. These walls may therefore represent the remains of the houses described by Thucydides in his account of the battle fought at Torone between the Athenians and the Spartans in 424/3 BC. Thucydides states that the Athenian hoplites sleeping in the agora of Torone at the time of the Spartan surprise attack managed to take refuge on the Lekythos, along with their allies among the citizens of Torone.176 Following a truce of two days for the purpose of taking up their dead and strengthening their respective positions, Brasidas made his attack on the Lekythos. Thucydides further states that the Athenian defenses on the promontory consisted of a badly constructed wall and some houses with parapets.177 It is clear from his account that these houses must be located near the point where the promontory is connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. The Athenians had, furthermore, erected a wooden tower on top of one of these houses and carried onto it amphorae and pithoi full of water as well as large stones, in an attempt to beat off the Spartan offensive which was launched with the assistance of a siege engine. The weight of the pithoi, stones, and men proved too great and the house collapsed. According to Thucydides the damage was limited, but the rest of the Athenians who heard the crash from some distance without being able to see what was happening, thought that the Spartans had already taken that part of the city and rushed to their boats. Having taken the promontory, Brasidas razed its buildings to the ground and consecrated it all to the goddess Athena whose temple stood on the Lekythos.17® The underlying prehistoric remains, partly exposed in that part of TR 61 that was excavated in 1986, were not investigated in 1988, but closer study of the material recovered in 1986 points to the existence of what may prove to be undisturbed EI A levels, particularly PG or Sub-PG.179 In TR 63 (figs. 13-15; pis. 32:1-33: 2) the interior of a large structure identified as a cistern was investigated. Only about one half of the structure was cleared, consisting of a curved wall defining an apsidal or, more probably, circular building with a diameter of about 4m. A mixture of various kinds of stone was used for the construction of its wall, without the use of mortar bonding. The interior face was coated with a layer of waterproof plaster or cement, up to 4.5cm thick and of medium coarse texture. In places, traces of several finer layers of plaster were preserved. By the conclusion of the season the original floor of the cistern had not been reached because the progress of excavation was considerably slowed down by a complex stratigraphie sequence involving two groups of deposits horizontally distinct from one another. Toward the end of the season it had become clear that the original fill of the cistern (following the period of its original use), preserved toward the SW of the area under excavation, yielded pottery and other small finds that were not later than Hellenistic. Toward the NE this fill had been partly dug out and filled with domestic refuse. The latter yielded a great quantity of post-Byzantine pottery, the comparatively recent date of which was verified by the discovery of several fragmentary clay tobacco pipes and a number of Ottoman coins. The deposit also yielded a large quantity of organic material. On account of the loose 176 IV 113. 177 IV 115. 178 IV 116. 179 See Rep. 1986, 195.</page><page sequence="48">140 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos texture of the deposit of refuse, a series of later clay floors had subsided into the cistern. At least four, and perhaps as many as six or more, distinct surfaces were recorded and cleared. These were associated with the poorly preserved remains of post-Byzantine dwellings near the modern ground surface. Establishing the date of construction of the cistern might only be possible by means of further excavation, but a provisional date in the Hellenistic or Late Classical period is suggested by the material recovered from the original fill of the cistern, and that collected from a deposit, only a small part of which was excavated, along the exterior face of the wall of the structure. TR 68 (figs. 18-23; pis. 33: 4-34: 2), measuring 6 χ 7m, was the largest and most intricate of the trenches investigated in 1988. A complicated sequence of phases was encountered ranging in date from the BA to the post-Byzantine period. The earliest building uncovered was a small rectangular structure in the south sector, partly extending into TR 67. The structure was defined by Walls 9 and 10 in TR 68 and 16 in TR 67 (fig. 18). These were actually stone socles for mud-brick walls, incorporating as building material a number of large sea shells. A packed earth floor associated with the rectangular structure was exposed but not excavated. The small quantity of fragmentary pottery encountered immediately above the floor included EBA and MBA sherds and at least one fragment of an early Mycenaean vessel, probably LH IIA. Overlying these remains was another packed earth floor, which had been partly excavated in 1986 in TR 67. Set into this floor were two pithoi, the bases of which were found in situ.1*0 Although the pottery and the other small finds associated with this floor were too meagre to provide a firm date, the presence of at least one Mycenaean decorated sherd in its clay matrix would argue that it dates either to the LBA or to the EIA.m A small quantity of Archaic pottery found in later deposits of the trench, together with a somewhat greater quantity of Submycenaean, Protogeometric, and Geometric sherds was probably the result of disturbance caused during the Classical and later periods. No architectural remains of the earlier periods were preserved in situ, unless the floor mentioned above dates from the EIA. Several Classical phases were explored in TR 68. The earliest is perhaps represented by two large refuse pits partly uncovered in the south and north-east sectors. These appear to belong to a period of demolition and subsequent preparation and levelling of the ground aiming at creating a surface for construction. A good deal of fragmentary pottery was recovered from the two pits, the preliminary study of which would indicate that they date to the earlier part of the 4th cent. BC. One of the pits also yielded a fragmentary stone gutta, while another, similar, gutta was found in a later deposit (figs. 23a-b). These two architectural members, in addition to other evidence obtained earlier, further support Thucydides' statement of the existence of a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena on the promontory,182 and indicate that the temple was of the Doric order. The overlying Classical remains comprise a series of walls of several structures which are presumably domestic, along with their associated packed earth and stone paved floors. The study of the relationship of these walls to one another, along with the preliminary study of the material from the associated deposits, points to several phases 180 Ibid. 200 ill. 20, pp.203-4. 181 Ibid. 204 n. 74. 182 IV 116.</page><page sequence="49">Excavations at Torone, 1988 141 of construction and occupation, the latest of which may extend into the Hellenistic period. No conclusive evidence of occupation was obtained in TR 68 during the centuries from the later Hellenistic to the Late Byzantine period. The Late Byzantine remains exposed include Wall 4, into the top of which terracotta pipes were set in mortar to channel water from the higher ground in the SW into the large double cistern excavated by the Byzantine Ephoreia of Chalkidike prior to the commencement of the current excavations. The deposits associated with this wall and more particularly several Byzantine bronze trachys dating to the 13th century suggest that it probably went out of use at that time. In addition to the trachys, these deposits yielded a number of fragmentary pots and other small finds of the period. These remains were all the more important since, by the end of the 1986 campaign, conclusive evidence of occupation on the promontory during the Byzantine period had not been established. The post-Byzantine remains in TR 68 were extensive and attest the existence of a prosperous, if small, community during that time. The earliest post-Byzantine remains include six rubbish pits which were cleared, or partly cleared, in 1988. As with the Classical pits mentioned above, the post-Byzantine pits are part of a general preparation of the area for subsequent construction. Overlying them were several phases of post-Byzantine construction and occupation, which may have continued as late as the 19th century. A number of houses of this period were explored, along with their associated floors, hearths, and other architectural features. A large quantity of well-stratified pottery was also recovered, the closer study of which should provide a valuable typology of post-Byzantine ceramic products. A similar, but less complex, course of events was encountered in TR 72 (figs. 28-31; pi. 34: 3-5), located toward the NW of the area under excavation. Here, too, a number of domestic structures of the post-Byzantine period were explored in the upper levels of the trench. Underlying them were several pits (especially Pits 1 and 2) which yielded a large quantity of Late- or post-Byzantine pottery and other small finds. A large constructed tomb was found in the centre of the trench. The rectangular tomb, measuring 3.00 χ 1.75m, was built with various kinds of stone bonded with lime mortar. It is oriented roughly E/W and has two steps at its Ε end suggesting an entrance there. The inhumed bones in the tomb were found in a very poor state of preservation and it remains, for the time being, unclear whether.the tomb contained one or more burials. Kterismata include an iron cross and ring, several beads of various materials, a bronze buckle, a bone or ivory die, as well as a small, fragmentary, coarse-ware vessel. Although the tomb is not unlike some of the larger stone-built Late Roman tombs excavated on Terrace IV in earlier campaigns, the kterismata would seem to suggest a Byzantine(?) rather than a Late Roman date. The presence of a cross among the offerings or items of personal decoration worn by the deceased would suggest that the occupant(s) of the tomb belonged to the Christian faith. The location and size of the tomb greatly limited the area in which it was possible to investigate earlier remains, although where excavation in greater depth was possible, important prehistoric remains were brought to light. The latter included a packed clay surface, with what appeared to be an associated post hole, underlying a deposit partially composed of decayed sun-dried mud brick. The clay matrix of the floor overlay bedrock which was encountered at 10.30-10.49m above sea level, at a significantly higher point than the natural rock revealed in TR 69 in 1986. Preliminary study of the fragmentary pottery recovered from the relevant deposits appears to indicate that much of it is of EBA date.</page><page sequence="50">142 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Although, generally speaking, the EB A levels seem to have survived better than those of the MBA and LB A, primarily because of the damage caused to the latter by Classical and post-Classical building activity, it is worth stressing the presence of clearly identifiable MBA pottery and the discovery of some of the earliest Mycenaean pottery imported in Macedonia including LH I and LH IIA fragments. Although greatly outnumbered by pottery of the EBA, the MBA material so far recovered from the Lekythos is proving to be of great interest. The corresponding pottery from inland Macedonian sites such as Assiros, Kastanas, Vardaroftsa, and Saratse, cannot be easily separated into MBA and LBA stages.1*3 Elsewhere in Macedonia, evidence for a well defined MBA phase comes primarily from coastal sites in Chalkidike, such as Molyvopyrgos and Haghios Mamas.184 The existence of both locally produced and imported varieties of 'Minyan' pottery at Torone underlines the significant role played by coastal sites in Chalkidike as regards contact with sites further south. It is also worth noting that although much of the EBA material recovered from the Lekythos is steeped in the local Macedonian tradition, external links with sites such as Troy, Poliochni, Chios, Samos, and Argissa-Magoula, are perhaps more readily seen at Torone than further inland. These links with the outside world must be due to the geographical setting of the site in relation to the Aegean and its location on a promontory jutting out into the sea on an important coastal route and enjoying the advantages of a fine harbour.185 Torone differs from the usual mound sites in Macedonia in that the location of the latter must have been determined by the proximity of arable land and the availability of inland communications rather than by the proximity of the sea.186 These links of Torone with the south continue into the LBA and are important because the evidence for contacts between Macedonia and the Mycenaean world during the LH I and II periods is very limited. So far only the Toumba in Kalamaria, on the littoral of the Thermaic Gulf, has yielded artefacts of Early Mycenaean date, and in this context one should also mention a single piece of gold jewellery from Kastanas, of a type reminiscent of gold jewellery found in Grave Circle Β at Mycenae.187 The discovery of Mycenaean sherds of LH I and LH II date at Torone provides important new evidence for the presence of Mycenaeans in the North Aegean and underlines the importance of such coastal sites for the diffusion of southern Greek styles of pottery to sites further inland in Macedonia.188 The physical character and geographical setting of Torone continue to be important throughout the EIA and the historic era up to the post-Byzantine period. Indeed, few sites in Greece can claim such a long and, relatively speaking, unbroken history as Torone. 183 See especially Κ. A. Wardle, BSA 75, 1980, 262. 184 Ibid.; Heurtley op. cit. 208ff. 185 For the importance of the harbour at Koupho, the ΚΩΦΟΣ ΛΙΜΗΝ of ancient sources, see B. D.

While the importance of the ΚΩΦΟΣ ΛΙΜΗΝ is obvious for the navigation of the region in antiquity during bad weather, the archaeological evidence suggests that the main harbour of Torone was the sandy bay immediately to the Ν and Ε of the Lekythos.
