<plain_text><page sequence="1">MINI-WOOD COMMUNITY. Nature's World in Miniature in a Half Acre of New England Woodland: A Fascinating Recounting of a 15-Year Biological-Ecological Study. By Paul Griswold Howes. Published by Exposition Press, Hicksville, New York for Sylvanus Books, Noroton, Connecticut. $20.00. xii + 233 p. + 89 pl.; ill.; in- dex. 1975. A good introduction to nature study in a nonstruc- tured, almost hobby fashion, this book is a result of 15 years of careful, nonsystematic observations in one-half acre of deciduous woodland in Connecti- cut by an experienced naturalist. The author was Curator of the Bruce Museum (Greenwich, Conn.) from 1919 to 1964 and has been a life-long collector and observer of natural history in many places. The stated purpose of the book, "to point out how very rich in organisms any woodland area may be," certainly is accomplished through its 21 chapters, 495 well-captioned and referenced black-and-white pho- tographs, and 24 explicit drawings. It is not, however, merely a one-volume encyclopedia of nature study. At first, while merely reading the book, the writing and photography seemed amateurish, even clumsy. However, after becoming aware that the author was really sharing his philosophy and first-hand experi- ences in a personal, casual manner, the over-full sentences and random selection of incidents produced a pleasantly chatty mood-somewhat spoiled only by the intrusion of the author's use of the stilted, imper- sonal third person when referring to himself. This very good account of field and laboratory observations of a woodland community, its compo- nents, and their interrelationships is divided into Part One: Botanical and Part Two: Zoological, a preface, acknowledgments, a short list of books recommended for further reading (mostly identification aids), and an index useful to almost any reader. Part One (seven chapters) deals with trees and shrubs, vines, wildflowers, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens. Part Two (13 chapters) deals with protozoans, "Tree Trunk Traffic" (various arthropods), "Army of the Soil" (3 chapters which the author considers to be "the keystone of the book"); insects (3 chapters); molluscs; amphibians; reptiles; birds (2 chapters); and mammals. The subject matter, from protozoans ("ubiquitous bits of life") to resident mammals, is illustrated ac- curately and rather profusely and is described in detail. Some few photographs (e.g., oak catkins) are superfluous, others (e.g., acorns) are very useful. Very little information is questionable (e.g., poison-ivy rash spreads from scratching) and the reader learns much by deduction rather than by direction. The descrip- tions in some detail range from the catapaulting technique of collembolans to the ecology of soil formation and literally fascinate the reader, initiated or uninitiated! Occasionally anthropomorphic, sometimes judg- mental, the author's comments and opinions are reasoned and the basis for them is frequently stated. The style is not pedantic, the content is painlessly educational, and the reader benefits from being titilated rather than overcome. Sometimes quaint, reflecting the book's format, the experiences de- scribed range from that of a baby skunk who "simply outstood a cow" to the intricate process of cross- pollination. Some descriptions merely identify, others de- light-for example, the procedure for tasting the nectar of Japanese honeysuckle so as to experience "a taste sensation which bees and butterflies, bugs and bats, hummingbirds-and the gods, as well- have known throughout the ages" (p. 24). Other- wise ordinary experiences become adventures in dis- covery; investigation is stimulated through mysteries, such as that of the true relationship between Indian Pipe and a fungus or that of the distribution of infusorians. The author, while refreshingly recognizing the</page><page sequence="2">338 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 51 limits to his own knowledge in special fields, clearly demonstrates (without labeling it) the joy of learning from first-hand observation complemented by assis- tance from reference people and books. The author's reasoned reverence for life, also unlabeled, is evident throughout, but especially in his strong, nonsenti- mental plea for the recognition and consideration of all forms of life before eliminating them or their habitats willy-nilly. The printing imperfections in my copy, of eight pages of photographs, the misspellings, and the occasional imprecision in the name of a plant or animal do not lessen the value of this book as an excellent account of, even guide to, nature study for the novice or as stimulating reading to the experi- enced observer.
