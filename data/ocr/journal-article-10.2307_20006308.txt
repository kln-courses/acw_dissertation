Stud. 23, pp. I-I 7 JOHN CLAYTON Department of Religious Studies, The University of Lancaster RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS1 Philosophers have tended to discuss theistic proofs (and theistic disproofs) largely in abstraction from their specific roles within the religious traditions in which those proofs were cultivated and in which, until modern times, they flourished. As a result, the traditional theistic proofs of the West are generally presented in the philosophical literature as no more than (failed) attempts to demonstrate or within tolerable limits to establish the probability of the existence of at least one god. Whatever the history of philosophy may suggest, the history of religions shows that theistic proofs have been developed from a variety of motives and have been employed to a variety of ends, only one of which is to persuade someone not already so inclined to believe that god/s exist. Indeed, this latter purpose is fairly subsidiary in the history of religions. A survey of the place and roles of theistic proofs and disproofs within a range of religious traditions, Eastern as well as Western, suggests that in the main they were used to serve intra-traditional ends. Their principal function seems to have been more nearly explanatory than justificatory.2 Even when they aimed them outside the tradition and used them to apologetic ends, purveyors of the proofs tended to assume prior belief in god/s on the part of their intended audience. The specifically religious significance of theistic proofs has been too little explored in recent philosophy of religion. In some cases, the very people who have been best equipped to do so have appeared most unwilling to undertake such exploration. The author of Reasons and Faiths, for instance, might have been expected to develop his observations there into a more systematic analysis of the religious import of theistic proofs. Yet, despite the beginning made in Doctrine and Argument in Indian Philosophy, when Smart came later to discuss some theistic proofs in Philosophers and Religious Truth and in The 1 This article originated as a paper read in Michaelmas Term I983 to the Philosophical Society at the University of Lancaster. For their criticisms and suggestions, I am indebted to a number of colleagues, most especially the following: John Benson, R. L. V.

It is not merely that he made little reference in those volumes to non-Western deployments of proofs, but that he attended so little to their specifically religious functions and so much to their strictly philosophical features. Smart, of course, allows that proofs for the existence of god/s have a properly religious import, even if he has never worked out this insight in any detail. A sizable number of contemporary philosophers of religion, however, would appear to deny even this basic point. Those philosophers who are most self-consciously influenced by Wittgenstein, for example, have been almost uniformly reluctant to allow that theistic proofs have a legitimate role in religious 'forms of life'. With the notable exception of the so-called 'onto logical argument', the traditional theistic proofs have tended to be eschewed by such philosophers as no more than illicit attempts to justify playing 'the religious language game'. Wittgenstein himself, of course, had little time for theistic proofs; and it might be reasonably suggested that aversion to such proofs belongs inextricably to any philosophy of religion undertaken in the Wittgensteinian mode. But it could also be argued that such aversion is occasioned more by the way these arguments have been used in the history of modern philosophy than by any considered analysis of the function of such arguments within religious forms of life. When viewed from this perspective, the traditional arguments may more plausibly be regarded as moves within religious language games proper than as antecedent attempts to justify the playing of such games. Three points will help illustrate what I mean, although none of the three can be fully supported here. First, theistic proofs are not 'tradition neutral'. They cannot be pressed without some modification into the service of incompatible doctrinal schemes. Such proofs are themselves already aspects of a particular doctrinal scheme and their specific meaning is shaped by their place within that scheme. Some theistic proofs, including the mediaeval ratio Anselmi (as it was then known), originated within the scheme in which they continued to exercise their principal influence. Certain other theistic proofs originated outside the doctrinal scheme/s onto which they were later grafted. This grafting, however, was by no means a simple process. The suitability of candidate proofs seems to have been measured, not so much by their ability to provide grounds which might lead to belief as by their ability to confirm an already held belief. Historically, those 'proofs' were favoured which expressed support for or which could be adapted to provide support for the specific idea of god/s which the tradition already embraced. To take one familiar example from the history of Western religious thought: Thomas Aquinas is famous for his 'five ways', but these five are merely a selection made from the numerous arguments in circulation within mediaeval Europe. At one point or other in his writings, Thomas himself commended no fewer than eleven separate proofs for God's existence. More importantly, he rejected as many</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS 3 as thirteen others, which were adjudged either formally invalid or theologi cally inadequate or both. His short list of five 'ways' represents those which he judged to be both logically valid and theologically sound.1 His favourite proof was the argument from 'motion' or 'change', the argumentum ex parte motus. It figures prominently both in the Summa Theologiae and in the Summa contra Gentiles, and it is the only proof endorsed in his Compendium Theologiae, which was written in the year before he died. Tracing briefly the 'prehistory' of this one proof will illustrate the way in which proofs are sometimes adapted to the requirements of particular religious traditions.2 The proof from 'motion' can be traced back to Aristotle. In books H and E of the Physics, he (or his school) offered two separate arguments from motion (Kivr1ais) in order to demonstrate, not the existence of the God of theism, but the existence of some immanent first cause or causes within the universe or at its very edges. By creatively misreading Aristotle, however, the mediaeval Muslim philosophers managed to conflate these two arguments into a single proof which they held to be compatible with the requirements of a somewhat deterministically inclined monotheism. And their reinterpre tation of Aristotle was further modified by the Jewish philosopher Moses ben Maimon, who was more attracted to their monotheism than he was to their determinism, which ran counter to the voluntaristic tendency in the Jewish idea of God. Thomas Aquinas attributed the proof to Aristotle, but presented it basically in the form in which he found it in Maimonides, with the result that the ancient argument from motion came to be used in defence of the existence of a single First Cause whose attributes differed significantly both from those adduced by Aristotle and from those ascribed to the God of Islam. This brief sketch suggests one way in which the requirements of different religious traditions acted as a control on the formulation of a theistic argument. The resistance within mediaeval Islam to the proofs of the Arab philosophers further suggests that the grafting of a novel argument onto a vigorous tradition is not without danger. Be that as it may, the ways in which the argument from motion was adapted to the needs of traditions to which it always remained subservient show that theistic proofs are more integrated than is sometimes supposed into specific doctrinal schemes. Secondly, theistic proofs exhibit clearly the religious 'form of life' in the range of experiences which they express. Their significance lies, not merely in their compatibility with specific doctrinal schemes, but also in their ability to express the range of religious exDeriences and the sorts of relikious nietv Cf. esp.

I -2</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN CLAYTON which are tolerated within the tradition of which they form a part.1 Each of the traditional arguments for God's existence which have persisted in the West - the ontological, the cosmological, the teleological, and the moral proof - expresses the sorts of experience which have drawn people, not only to belief in what they took to be God, but also to worship of the deity. This holds equally for proofs a priori and a posteriori, proofs from pure reason and from practical reason. The ontological argument in at least its Anselmian form expresses a quiet but deep sense of awe before God as God; the various cosmological arguments express in different ways the sheer uncanniness that there should exist anything at all; the teleological arguments communicate that sense of wonder which can be evoked by even the most ordinary regularities or goal-directed tendencies exhibited in the world-order; the moral argument articulates that sense of oughtness which drives as if by divine imperative toward the highest good. Each of these sorts of experience can be correlated with different styles of religious piety and forms of worship. There is one style of piety which looks inward in prayerful contemplation in order to know the very being of God and which tends to favour the rather cerebral language on ontology, without any admixture of the merely 'empirical'. There is a second, more devotional style which sees the hand of God in all that is and which tends to favour the more anthropomorphic language of popular religion. As one would expect, this sort of piety is most at home with the quasi-empirical proofs and most especially with the design argument. And there is a third style of piety which holds the practice of virtue to be the only worship required or worthy of the Author of all good. These brief examples, each of which could be elaborated at length, suggest some ways in which types of theistic proof might be correlated with types of religious experience and practice. The question arises, of course, whether these links are 'strong' or 'weak'. In at least some cases, the links would seem to be strong.. The design argument seems most intimately connected with popular piety, so that it is hardly surprising that this proof is the most widespread in the history of religions. It has flourished in the ancient and in the modern world, and in Eastern and in Western religions alike. As one would expect, it is especially strong in those traditions which stress worship or devotion (bhakti). It is at least implicit in the Hebrew Bible (Psalm I9) and, in modern times, it was set to music in the hymn 'The Spacious Firmament'. It seems quite natural for the design argument to be sung as a hymn. Not so the ontological argument. It expresses a very different sort of religious experience and is typical of quite another style of religious piety. The sort of piety expressed in Anselm's argument is of the contemplative (yoga), not the devotional variety. Anselm's aim, as expressed in the Proslogion, 1 In section iI below, I suggest that this observation holds equally for the theistic disproofs attributed to the Buddha, but here I confine my remarks to theistic proofs common in the West.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS 5 is immediate and direct knowledge of God's very being. (Op. Om. I, Ioo) This he hopes to achieve through a proof grounded in pure reason, for - as he had already said in the earlier Monologion - it is through reason alone that we come nearest to knowing God's true essence. (Op. Om. I, 77 f.) Anselm was not, of course, commending the 'unaided reason' of later invention. Anselm held that it is God who draws us to that understanding which we seek. (Op. Om. I, I04) His is a 'faith-full reason', and it is not irrelevant to his purposes that his proof was offered in the form of a prayer addressed to the very God who is its subject. The argument in any other form would not be Anselm's proof. Thirdly, theistic proofs of some sort have featured in virtually every major religious tradition, Eastern no less than Western. This suggests that the presence of theistic proofs in Western religions is not simply a consequence of Greek influence on Western theologies. Indeed, allowing for a certain amount of local variation, all of the theistic proofs which we tend to regard as peculiarly 'ours' can be found duplicated in the Indian and far Eastern religious traditions. Both the design argument and the cosmological argu ment are common in Indian thought. And Udayana even anticipated some moves we associate with the ontological argument in his attempt to convince Buddhists that it is impossible for God (Ivara) not to exist.' Although the moral argument seems not to have been used in classical Indian thought, something akin to its Kantian version can be found prefigured in China in the writings of Mo Tzu. Mo's ethical thought is a curious mixture of seemingly incompatible motives: he proposed on largely utilitarian grounds an ethic of love (Ai), but insisted that the practice of universal love conforms to the Will of Heaven. He argued for the existence of ghosts and spirits on the ground that such beings are required to witness the practice of righteousness (Li) amongst humankind, so that the worthy can be rewarded and the evil-doer punished, thereby ensuring that happiness is proportional to virtue, according to the Will of Heaven (cf. Mo Tzu, ? 3I). Although further examples could be offered, these few would seem to be sufficient to show that constructing arguments about the existence of god/s is a general feature of humankind's religious quest, and not merely an accident of Western intellectual history. But this is not the whole story. Theistic proofs may be widespread in the world's religions, but opposition to such proofs is equally widespread in those same religious traditions. Strong opposition to rational proofs arose within both Judaism and Islam, as well as within Western Christianity. And, in India, Ramanuja developed a strong case against all possible theistic proofs as being both religiously dangerous and philosophically unsound (e.g. SrT Bhagya, I, i, 3). This would seem to suggest that theistic proofs, in addition ' Cf. Book Three of J\lyayakusuma-njali. I am grateful to Professor B. K. Matilal for having suggested this interpretation to me.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN CLAYTON to belonging to the heart of religious piety, are also perceived by many believers to represent some danger to theistic religion's sacred centre. II The standing of theistic proofs within religious traditions is radically ambiguous. They seem capable with almost equal force of both attracting and repulsing the religious spirit. But this very ambivalence heightens, rather than diminishes, their religious significance. And it suggests that we should enquire more closely into their place within the history of religions. Within the limits of this article, it is obviously impossible to do more than offer a preliminary survey of the territory that would require careful exploration in any proper analysis of the religious significance of arguments for and against the existence of god/s. Present purposes will be served, however, by indicating something of the variety of roles played by theistic proofs (and disproofs) within different types of religion. Brief attention is given in this section to three dissimilar types of religious tradition: a radically monotheistic tradition (Islam); a theistically more pluralistic tradition (Hinduism); and a more-or-less 'a-theistic' tradition (Theravada Buddhism). The older Indian traditions will be introduced before turning to Islam, the tradition which has most directly influenced the role of theistic proofs within Judaism and Christianity (the religions from which are borrowed most of the examples to be cited in section III of this article). (i) It is important at the outset to emphasize that discussion of theistic proofs, though widespread, was very much subordinate to other concerns within Indian religions. Indeed, 'right doctrine' was never accorded the sort of priority within Indian religious thought that it has sometimes been given in the West.' But, for our purposes, this makes Indian religion all the richer as a resource for arguments concerning the existence of god/s. Enormous diversity necessarily developed there in regard to theistic proofs because a wide range of theologies or even atheologies has flourished within the theistically permissive ambience of the astika or 'orthodox' systems of Hindu thought. Several orthodox Hindu sects have taught the existence of a single, uncreated and eternal Lord of the world, sIvara, variously conceived as Brahma, Visnu, Siva (to recall one common triad). Existence of ls'vara has sometimes been affirmed by a straightforward appeal to the revelation (s'ruti) which is recorded in Vedic or other holy scripture. Ramanuja, for instance, repudiated all possible divine proofs as illicit attempts to establish rationally I This point is rightly emphasized by Ninian Smart in his book Doctrine and Argument in Indian Philosphy (London and New York, I964). Despite being in some respects now dated, Surendranath Dasgupta's five-volume History of Indian Philosophy (Cambridge, 1922-54) remains the standard English-language survey of Indian approaches to the philosophy of religion, including theistic proofs and disproofs. The various volumes which have appeared so far of The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, ed. by Karl H. Potter, are also indispensable guides to the arguments of the texts of the main schools.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS 7 something which can be known through scripture alone. God's self-revealing activity, not our intellectual cunning, is the proper means whereby God is known in his grace (prasada). By way of contrast to Ramanuja, the somewhat earlier Udayana held that the authority of the Vedas is not self authenticating. Their authority is derived instead from their general trust worthiness as shown in part by the success of the theistic proofs, by which means the existence of Is'vara can be demonstrated (anumana) with certainty. Philosophically intermediate between Udayana and Ramanuja stood Madhva, the thirteenth-century Vaisnavite opponent of the Advaita Ved anta position which had been propounded by Sanikara in the ninth century. Madhva defended the view that, although they had no independent power to convince the skeptic or doubter, the arguments for God's existence could indeed be used to confirm the faith of one who had already affirmed the authority and uncreatedness of the Vedic scriptures (cf. Tarka-tdndava). Initially, Madhva's position appears to be quite similar to one which is familiar enough within Western theology. But, when viewed in relation to the other 'orthodox' schools within Indian religion, Madhva's position gains new significance. For mere acceptance of the Vedic authority did not entail that the message of the Vedas would be interpreted in a theistic manner. Some who accepted that same authority, most notably representatives of the Sarhkhya and of the Mlmarhsa, had interpreted the Vedas in a thoroughly a-theistic way. It would be quite important, therefore, for Madhva to be able to produce arguments that would help resolve the issue whether the tradition's sacred scriptures espouse atheism or theism (Ifvarav&amp;da). Even though this particular doctrinal dispute cannot be said to have had the sort of central import that it might have gained had it occurred in one of the Western monotheistic traditions, it is for us an illuminating example of the intra-traditional application of theistic proofs. The principal purpose served by arguments for and against the divine existence was in this instance to help settle a hermeneutical dispute that had arisen within Hindu orthodoxy about the proper interpretation of its own revelation, the final authority of which was equally acknowledged by all sides. These particular arguments, it seems, were not designed primarily to convince someone who stood without the tradition or who simply refused to acknowledge the Vedic authority. Disagreement about the existence of Is'vara had arisen within the tradition itself. But it was not a purely 'speculative' dispute, nor even simply a matter of correct interpretation. At issue was the fundamentally soteriological question: is our liberation from samizsdra furthered or is it hindered by the existence of Is'vara? And contrary answers to that question were tenable within Hindu orthodoxy. (2) The a-theistic answer to that question favoured by Siddharta Gau tama, the 'Buddha', was made in the first instance within Brahmanism. And it could well have been tolerated within that tradition had his own way of</page><page sequence="8">8 JOHN CLAYTON giving that answer not been entailed by his repudiation of other orthodox teachings which were more generally agreed among Hindus, including their somewhat deterministic interpretation of karma and sarmsdra and also their doctrine of the 'soul' (dtman). The Buddha's atheology is in fact a function of his repudiation of these and other views more constitutive of Hindu revelation and tradition (smrti). What may have begun as an intra-traditional disagreement, therefore, soon escalated into an inter-traditional dispute. And the Buddha's atheological proofs gained thereby an importance and an impetus that they would not have had within Hindu orthodoxy. They became part of a wider repudiation, not merely of a particular interpretation of (say) the Vedanta, but also of the authority of the Vedic revelation as such. Repudiating the Vedic authority did not mean for the Buddha that everything found in the Vedas is thereby repudiated. But it did mean that nothing found there has more authority than something found elsewhere. The Buddha commended the view that everything, including his own teaching, should be measured by its conformity to experience and practical reason alone. The Buddha's dhamma is not regarded as a new ideology in the same series as other ideologies. It is intended merely as a guide to understanding. For this reason, he refused to become embroiled in purely speculative disputes. They simply distract us from our chief aim and duty. If that was the Buddha's view, why then did he consider it worthwhile to construct theistic disproofs? Their place in his thought is clearly limited. He did not bother, for example, to deny the existence of gods (devas) conceived as contingent beings. But he did deny the existence of anything which a monotheist would allow to count as a God who is worthy of worship. And he did this for entirely religious/practical reasons. In order to be free, we must be liberated from the bondage to gods as well as from the bondage to other humans (Dhammapada, ? 4I7). This 'existential' concern explains the Buddha's preference for two theistic disproofs in particular, although he is reported also to have resorted to others. First, he argued that if the God of theism (Issaro) exists, then we are not masters of our own destinies and cannot, therefore, be responsibly free in our choices of action (Jdtaka, v, 238). By making the attainment of nibbdna depend in some measure upon God, theism at least partially undermines individual responsibility and thereby impedes enlightenment (bodhi) and prevents release. The second main disproof said to be favoured by the Buddha is an argument based on the problem of evil and suffering (Jdtaka, VI, 208). If God is creator of the world, then God must also be the author of all things, including evil and misfortune and injustice, all of which are obstacles to our salvation.' The Buddha's apparent preference for just these two disproofs is telling. They suggest that 1 For an elaboration of these two disproofs, see K. N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge (London, I963), and, more popularly, his posthumously published The Message of the Buddha (London, I975). See also Helmuth von Glasenapp, Buddhismus und Gottesidee (Mainz, 1954).</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS 9 he opposed theism, not because belief in God was thought to be untenable owing to the limits of human reason et cetera, but because belief in God is morally repugnant to the requirements of practical religion. Human salva tion is at stake. Even these theistic disproofs, therefore, express a deep religious sensitivity to which one should not be blinded by their explicitly atheistic character. The 'piety' which they embody, however, is of the contemplative oryoga, rather than of the devotional or bhakti variety. (3) Islam stands at the opposite extreme of the religious spectrum. Variety of opinion is not unknown within Islam, but the opinions that are tolerated are confined within the bounds of radical monotheism. In order to give coherence to the presentation of Muslim attitudes towards arguments for God's existence, one can usefully adapt a three-fold classification that was first suggested by the mediaeval Spanish philosopher ibn Rushd :1 the traditionalists or Qur'anic 'literalists', who adamantly rejected philosophical argument altogether and who professed that true knowledge of God comes through authoritative revelation alone; the 'scholastic' thinkers who affirmed the possibility of a rational demonstration of God's existence, whether from temporality (4udzith) or from possible being (jawdz); and the Sufis, who claimed direct knowledge of God's being through mystical insight. Rational proofs for God's existence obviously found favour neither within narrow traditionalism nor within fully developed Sufism. Representatives of the former were of the opinion that, for followers of Islam, belief is an obligation, so that raising questions of Qur'an is a heresy that is possibly more dangerous than unbelief itself. The so-called 'consolation of philosophy' was said to be an illusion and any inclination towards philosophy was said to be clear evidence of deficient faith. Although Sufism in its early period of development at least tolerated (without necessarily encouraging) the scho lastic style of argument known as kaldm, it gradually grew to emphasise the exclusive sufficiency of mystical experience. Within historical Islam, therefore, the proofs for God's existence played a positive role in the strategies of two groups: the 'scholastic theologians' (mutakallimuln) and the 'scholastic philosophers' (falasifa). But these two groups favoured very different sorts of theistic proof. And their different preferences betray deeper differences in their respective positions regarding the proper function of theistic proofs. These differences can be explained as follows. The kaldm had its origins within early attempts by Muslim theologians to understand the meaning of Qur'an and its application to Islamic life and thought. Although it degenerated later, this sort of Muslim 'scholastic 1 Cf. Al-Kashf 'an Mandhi al-Adillah. For helpful surveys of Islamic philosophy, including approaches to theistic proofs, see Oliver Leaman, An Introduction to Medieval Islamic Philosophy (Cambridge, I985), and Majid Fakhry, A History of Islamic Philosophy (New York, I 970), as well as the latter's 'The Classical Islamic Arguments for the Existence of God', Muslim World, XLVII (I957), 133-45. See also chapter 3 of William Lane Craig, The Cosmological Argumentfrom Plato to Leibniz (London, I980).</page><page sequence="10">IO JOHN CLAYTON theology' produced at least one philosophically astute proponent: namely, al-Ghazali. The mutakallimiun may have moved beyond the literalism of their more radically conservative co-religionists, but they did not ever question the truth of Islamic faith or the unique authority of Qur'an for Islam. Faith was indeed as much their starting-point as it had been for, say, Augustine or Anselm within the Christian tradition. Rational argument had for the mutakallimu-n a purely ancillary function. They were favourably disposed toward the huduth argument for God's existence on two grounds, both of which derived from principally religious motives: first, the proof from temporality alone adequately preserved their Qur'an-based belief in God as creator ex nihilo; and, secondly, the Aristotle-inspired argument from contin gency was thought to encourage a theologically defective view of God that, according to some mutakallimuin, differed insignificantly from atheism, to which it would inevitably lead. They reasoned that an eternal universe, whether uncaused or self-caused, had no need for a God causally to sustain it in existence. An eternal universe, according to the mutakallimiun, is necessarily self-sufficient. Their over-riding concern, therefore, was by means of rational argument to protect the Qur'anic doctrine of God as creator and sustainer of all that is. Although such philosophers as al-Farabi, ibn Sina and ibn Rushd were no less faithful followers of Islam than were al-Kindi and al-GhazMri, these falasifa adopted a very different strategy in respect to theistic proofs. Their over-riding concern was to construct on the basis of universally agreed principles an argument for the existence of an eternal God who acts as cause and sustainer of all that is. For the purposes of their argument, the authority of Qur'an was momentarily suspended. The various philosphers attached differing degrees of importance to the doctrine of creation in time, but all were agreed that this doctrine was consequent to affirming God's existence and not prerequisite to it, as the mutakallimun argued. The philosophers further countered that God's priority over the world is, in any case a causal priority and not simply a temporal one. Using Aristotle as their guide, the Islamic philosophers insisted that God's causal priority over the world could be adequately protected without recourse to a doctrine of temporal creation. There were genuine philosophical differences between the mutakallimuln and the faldsifa, to be sure, but there was also between them an essentially religious difference. They represent in the end two varieties of Muslim piety expressed in two different attitudes toward the relation of reason and faith, as well as toward the nature of Qur'anic authority. The Islamic 'scholastic theologians' can be said to have held that firm faith leads naturally to rational reflexion about the divine nature and existence as revealed in Qur'an; the ecclesiastically more independent-minded philosophers, on the other hand, can be said to have held that only those doctrines which can be rationally demonstrated are finally worthy of belief, even if this procedure</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS I I sometimes leads to deviation from views clearly taught in Qur'an and in Muslim tradition. Al-Ghazall and others used theistic proofs in order to confirm traditional doctrine; ibn Sina and ibn Rushd, however, used them at least in part to correct or to reform traditional doctrine. Within the community of the faithful, the mutakallimun were triumphant over the reforming philo sophers, whose influence nonetheless was keenly felt within Judaism through Moses ben Maimon and within Christianity through Thomas Aquinas, amongst others. Nor did the Muslim philosophers' influence within Chris tianity go unchallenged, as is shown by the condemnation of the 'errores Averrois' in edicts of I270 and I277. This all serves to show, moreover, that in the mediaeval period the so-called 'truths of reason' tended to be held in check by the theological requirements of particular religious traditions. And that suggests that what was expected of the theistic proofs in the middle ages was quite different from what came to be expected of them in the modern era. Just what was expected of them before the modern period? III In modern Western philosophy, the traditional theistic proofs have tended to be treated in isolation from the religious traditions in which they were developed. Once abstracted from their properly religious context, theistic proofs came to be expected to bear greater weight than they had been designed to bear when they were merely part of a larger theological strategy. They came to be expected without additional support to establish with certainty or at least high probability the existence of the God of theism. This, it is widely (but by no means universally!) agreed within contemporary philosophy, they have failed convincingly to do. But, one might argue, what they have failed to do is not what they were designed to do. Just what tasks were these alleged 'proofs' assigned in those religious traditions which have most intimately shaped Western religious thought? Within traditionalJudaism and Christianity, theistic arguments were used to more than one end. They were more frequently than not aimed at individuals or groups within their respective communities of faith in order to correct heresy, confirm true belief or simply express awe or wonder. But theistic arguments were also sometimes aimed apologetically at persons outside the community. This particular usage, which appears to be largely un known within Judaism, is widespread within traditional Christian thought, whether Catholic or Protestant. From the fact that theistic proofs were sometimes used to apologetic ends, however, one should not assume that they were necessarily intended to convince the skeptic or the atheist that there is a God. Theistic proofs were sometimes used by Christian apologists in order to establish some point of contact with non-Christian theists. One thinks especially of Thomas Aquinas.</page><page sequence="12">12 JOHN CLAYTON In the Summa contra Gentiles, for example, he laid out five ways in which pagan philosophers and Catholic teachers alike were said to have demonstrated God's existence (i, 13). His principal aim, however, seems not to have been to convince total skeptics or atheists that God exists and can be known to exist; the five ways outlined there were, rather, part of his strategy to convince mainly Muslims of the truth of the Catholic faith. Although it might have been useful in relation to heretics and Jews, rational argument was thought by Thomas to be necessary in any successful attempt to persuade Muslims to follow the path of Christian faith. Against heretics, Thomas commended the use of the New Testament as sufficient to convince them of the error of their ways; against Jews, he recommended appeal to the Old Testament; but against Muslims, it would be necessary to use natural reason, since they accepted the final authority neither of the Old nor of the New Testament (I, 2, 3). But, since the Muslims already believed in God, Thomas cannot have wanted by means of rational argument to convince them that God exists. So what did he intend? It would seem more likely that he had hoped through rehearsing such proofs (together with other proofs about God's nature) to establish with Muslims a positive basis upon which additional, more specifically Christian, arguments could be built. Thomas had suggested that rational proofs were necessary in dealing both with Muslims and with those whom he called 'pagans'. The latter were not in fact a major problem for the Spanish Catholic missionaries for whose benefit Thomas had prepared his Summa contra Gentiles. The so-called 'pagans' were more directly a concern of the pioneering Catholic mission aries, such as Roberto de Nobili and Matteo Ricci, who later served the missions in India and in China. To take but one example, de Nobili adapted Thomas's technique to the needs of the India mission.1 Initially and unsuccessfully, de Nobili attempted to use the Vedas directly as a foundation upon which to construct a Christian 'natural theology' and to do so in a way similar to the way Thomas had used Aristotle. Eventually and more successfully, however, he came simply to adopt Thomas's own natural theology, including the 'five ways'. And, as Thomas had done in relation to Spanish Muslims, de Nobili used those proofs wholly irenically in order to establish a groundwork of agreement with at least theistic Hinduism upon which could then be built a theologically Christian superstructure. By means of the Thomistic proofs, de Nobili hoped to convince theistic Hindus, not that God exists, but that their God and the Christian's God are one and the same. This, it was hoped, would provide a positive point-of-contact between these two religious traditions and thereby make the Hindus more receptive to the 1 Editions of de Nobili's relevant works include the following: Ajnana Nirvdranam (Trichinopoly, I 89 I); Atuma Nirunayariz (Madras, I889); Jftdnopadesam, vols I-II (I775; Madras, 2I89I), vol. in (Trichinopoly, I907); and Premiere Apologie (I6io), ed. with French transl. by Pierre Dahmen (Paris, 193I).

The theistic proofs were being used apologetically, to be sure, but more to establish a common basis of shared belief than to convince anyone that there is a God. This specifically Roman Catholicpositive point of contact can be contrasted sharply with the more characteristically Protestant negative point of contact which features in John Calvin's 'apologetic' use of theistic proofs. He argued in his Institutes of the Christian Religion that, although some knowledge of God is by nature implanted in all of us, such knowledge is wholly without benefit and serves only to condemn us for having failed to respond to God as manifest in our consciousness and in God's works (I, 3). Calvin commended without apparent reservation the Ciceronian argumentum e consensu gentium and even went so far as to recommend one form of the teleological argument (I, 5). In both cases, however, he insisted that such knowledge, although in principle accurate enough to convict us for having failed to respond, is not in fact 'true' knowledge since it derives not from God's own initiative but from our own. Calvin called special attention to the inability of human ' religions' to lead us to true knowledge not merely of the divine nature but also of God's very existence (ii, I 8). This style of apologetic is clearly worlds away from the gently irenical apologetic of someone like de Nobili. Despite the obvious differences, however, there is at least one important similarity: although theistic proofs were being aimed by de Nobili and Calvin alike at individuals who stood outside their communities of faith, neither man used them with the intention of convincing anyone that God exists. De Nobili presumed that 'true' knowledge of God's existence already prevailed within at least theistic Hinduism, so that it would be unnecessary to 'prove' it; Calvin presumed that 'true' knowledge of God's existence could be obtained only in obedient response to God's self-disclosure in revelation, so that it would be quite impossible to 'prove' it by any other means. Although theistic proofs have been used apologetically, they have also been used to serve needs wholly internal to a religious tradition. So common are these non-apologetic uses that one is tempted to claim that they are in fact more typical uses of the proofs than is their more strictly apologetic usage. First, theistic proofs have been employed in order to correct false or heretical beliefs about the nature of God. The clearest examples of this sort of usage can be found in mediaevalJewish and Islamic thought. TheJewish theologian Saadia benJoseph, for instance, constructed theistic proofs in part to correct the erroneous views of 'many believers whose belief is not pure and whose convictions are not sound'.' Who were these 'many believers'? To be counted among them was most certainly anyone who purported to profess God's existence whilst failing to affirm the temporality of the universe. This was also the sort of Muslim 'believer' against whom al-Ghazali aimed 1 The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans. and ed. by Samuel Rosenblatt (New Haven, I 948), p. 7.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOHN CLAYTON his own philosophical (as well as political) skills. 'Unbelievers' in the sense of atheists posed less a direct threat to the mediaeval Muslim and Jewish world than did the falasifa, whose adaptation of Aristotle threatened to undermine belief in a doctrine most certainly enjoined by both the Qur'an and the Hebrew Bible. Theistic proofs were used in both traditions in order to protect a teaching which was held to be fundamental by each against a contrary position which had been gaining ground within both Islam and Judaism. An essentially intra-traditional controversy was being conducted by means of arguments which at least superficially seemed to be aimed primarily at 'the Unbeliever'. The practitioners of kaldm seem to have held that if the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo were denied, then one might as well be an unbeliever, since the universe would then be self-sufficient. Begin with Aristotle, it was purported, and you will end with Strato. Not only did the Jewish and Islamic mutakallimiin attempt to refute all who denied the doctrine of creation, they also sought rationally to ground the doctrine of a temporal creation. But this suggests a second possible use of theistic proofs. Proofs for God's existence have commonly been used in order to confirm to the understanding something that is already a matter of firm faith. Anselm's Proslogion, which for a time circulated under the title Fides Quaerens Intellectum, provides one fairly obvious example of this use of a theistic proof. But such examples are not restricted to Christianity. Within Judaism, for instance, Saadia put proofs to a not dissimilar usage. Saadia rejected the sufficiency of reason in matters religious, but insisted nonetheless that reason can properly be used to corroborate revelation in order to show the essential reasonableness of the belief. His procedure was to develop parallel arguments within a single proof. He typically began a proof with a doctrine found in Jewish scripture and then proceeded to show that, not only is it true to faith by divine revelation, but it is also intelligible to feason through philosophical proof. A good example of this technique is found in his defence of the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, which he in turn used to prove God's existence.1 The presence of the teaching in Jewish scripture was itself sufficient for Saadia to conclude that we have no choice but to accept its truth on divine authority. But he held that it can also be confirmed by rational argument. Saadia offered in surprisingly short space four separate proofs for the temporality of the universe: from its finitude, from its composite nature, from the inherence in it of accidents, and from its existence in time. Having demon strated to at least his own satisfaction that the universe had a beginning in time, Saadia then set out to determine whether it was self-caused or created by some external cause. He argued that nothing could be self-caused, so that the universe must have been caused by some external agent. He then sought to show that this external cause, the necessity of which had been 1 Ibid. pp. 38 ff.</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS I5 demonstrated speculatively, conforms exactly to that which could also be proved from Scripture alone, namely Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God (Psalm 90. 2 RSV). This verse was used by Saadia as more than a mere illustration. It was itself a move in the argument. By citing from the goth Psalm, he thought that the argument had been sealed, that he had been able to return to the point from whence he had begun. Only then was the proof complete. Saadia's proof was being asked to serve more than one end, but at least one of those ends was to confirm to the understanding a doctrine that had already been accepted on very different grounds. Closely associated with this aim, Saadia moreover intended to help shore up wavering faith in God on the part of any doubter within the Jewish community. Amongst the ends served, however, does not seem to have been included that of persuading someone not already so inclined to believe that God truly exists. He did occasionally refer to 'Unbelievers', but they seem to have been individuals who held false opinions about God, not people who denied altogether the existence of God. Finally, theistic proofs have been used to express a sense of awe or wonder. This usage, which seems quite appropriately expressed in prayers or hymns or poetry, comes perhaps nearest to the heart of the religious sensibility of the more devotional or bhakti variety. A particularly powerful non argumentative expression of such wonder in response to God's creation can be found in the first, and apparently original, half of the Hebrew Bible's Psalm I19: The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard; yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and like a strong man runs its course with joy. Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and there is nothing hid from its heat. (RSV) The earthiness and directness of this early form of 'natural theology' possibly caused the Hebrews to have second thoughts, so that it was felt necessary later to add a similar number of verses praising the Law as the only sure and perfect revelation of God's will.' This Psalm was perhaps not far from Kant's 1 However much they may have differed from one another about details of interpretation and basic approaches to the text, this century's leading commentators on the Psalms - including Briggs, Kraus, Mowinckel and Weiser - have agreed that vs. 7-14 are a later addition to I9. i-6.</page><page sequence="16">i6 JOHN CLAYTON mind when at the end of the Critique of Practical Reason he wrote: 'Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.'1 The original six verses alone, however, seem to have inspired 'A Spacious Firmament', the hymn in which Addison eloquently expressed his generation's awe before 'the works of an almighty hand': The spacious firmament on high, with all the blue ethereal sky, and spangled heav'ns, a shining frame, their great Original proclaim. The unwearied sun from day to day does his Creator's power display, and publishes to every land the works of an almighty hand. Soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale, and nightly to the list'ning earth repeats the story of her birth; whilst all the stars that round her burn, and all the planets in their turn, confirm the tidings, as they roll, and spread the truth from pole to pole. What though in solemn silence all move round the dark terrestrial ball; what though nor real voice nor sound amid their radiant orbs be found; in reason's ear they all rejoice, and utter forth a glorious voice, for ever singing as they shine, 'The hand that made us is divine.'2 In respect to content, it is quite near to the i gth Psalm; in respect to form, however, it is nearer to a non-inferential version of the modern design argument. Both the Psalmist and the poet, however, are taken more by the evidence of God's 'ordinary' presence and activity in the workings of the creation than by the evidence of God's 'extraordinary' presence and activity in mighty saving acts or direct intervention in human affairs. The wonder of the ordinary is what attracted also Luther, who was not by nature well-disposed toward theistic proofs, to the teleological argument: We have very obvious proof that God exists, in the exact and perpetual movement of the heavenly bodies: we find that the sun rises and sets from year to year in its regular place. We reach the same conclusion from the certainty with which those things, which are a part of our daily experience, do not excite our wonder; they are 1 Transl. by Lewis White Beck (Indianapolis and New York, I956), p. I66. 2 Hymns Ancient and Modern, ?662.</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIONS, REASONS AND GODS I 7 hardly deemed worthy of notice. But if a person should be educated from his youth up in a dark place, and after twenty years released, he would be astonished at the sun and wonder what it was and why it always took a certain course at any given time!' Luther is not here putting forth an argument for God's existence with a view to demonstrating to an unbeliever that there is a God. Surely, he is attempting instead to evoke from his listener, who already believes and trusts in God, greater sensitivity to the divine presence in the ordinary events of life which we too commonly take for granted. His aim is not far removed from that of the author of the I gth Psalm; nor from that of the composer of' A Spacious Firmament'; but it is far removed from many a philosopher's pre-understanding of the aims of theistic proofs.
