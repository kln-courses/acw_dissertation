<plain_text><page sequence="1">XL THE POLITICAL SYMBOLISM OF PROMETHEUS UNBOUND ALTHOUGH it has long been recognized that there is a certain po- litical-historical content to Prometheus Unbound, there has, so far, been no attempt to make a consistent interpretation of it in terms of this content.' It is the object of this paper to attempt to remedy this defect. In so doing I shall present only interpretations which can be sup- ported by reference to Shelley's other works, in many of which the same basic ideas are present though, fortunately, minus their symbolic garb. Prometheus and the Furies The first problem to confrontus in this task is that of the identities of Prometheus and the Furies, for it is clear that Prometheus is more than the Titan of Aeschylus, and the Furies more than the Furies of the Eumenides. Shelley gives us our first important clue in the vision of the French Revolution which the Furies show to Prometheus, and which Prometheus later repeats to Panthea: Names are there, Nature's sacred watchwords, they Were borne aloft in bright emblazonry; The nations thronged around, and cried aloud, As with one voice, Truth, liberty, and love! The first notable attempt at an interpretation, that by W. M. Rossetti (The Shelley Society's Papers, Part I, pp. 138-179), places the emphasis upon the anti-religious element: Jupiter is the anthropomorphic god who tyrannizes over the mind of man (Prometheus) that created him. Most critics, however, have emphasized the moral element and the general pattern of interpretation goes somewhat as follows: Evil-Jupiter-is expelled from the universe by Eternity (or Necessity)-Demogorgon-assisted by Beauty (or Love or Nature)-Asia-as a result of the moral transformation of Mankind (or the Mind of Man)-Prometheus. To this pattern has been added in recent years a neoplatonic super- structure by Professor Carl Grabo in Prometheus Unbound: An Interpretation (Chapel Hill, 1935) and The Magic Plant (Chapel Hill, 1936): Prometheus and Demogorgon are two hypostases of the One, Demogorgon "the generative principle," Prometheus the "intellectual hyspostasis"; with the overthrow of Jupiter Prometheus draws closer to the mysterious fountain-source of the One. In A Newton Among Poets (Chapel Hill, 1935), Professor Grabo reveals an extensive use of scientific knowledge and symbolism in the poem. The latest interpretation, that of Professor Newman I. White in Shelley (New York, 1941), follows the traditional interpretation, though with rather more flexibility in the handling of the symbolism, e.g., "Up to this point the meaning of the poem is quite clear. Jupiter, the active agent of evil, owes his power to Prometheus; and an inherent, ineradicable impulse in man's nature and in the whole universe stands ready to free hu- manity from its sufferings (really self-imposed) when the human spirit, like Prometheus, demonstrates its worthiness by steadfastness and generosity" (n, 117). 728</page><page sequence="2">Kenneth Neill Cameron Suddenly fierce confusion fell from heaven Among them: there was strife, deceit and fear; Tyrants rushed in, and did divide the spoil. (i. 648 ff.) By means of this vision the Furies hope to break Prometheus's spirit. Here, we are on familiar ground. This is Shelley's old theme of the collapse of the French Revolution around which he built his (now lost) novel of 1812, Hubert Cauvin-"a tale illustrative of the failure of the French Revolution to benefit mankind"2-and which features in his extant works from the Irish pamphlets to A Philosophical View of Re- form.3 In 1816 he urged Byron to use it as the subject for a major poem,4 and, when Byron failed to do so, used it himself in The Revolt of Islam.5 The most explicit, and, for our purpose, most illuminating account of his theories on the subject is to be found in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam: The panic which, like an epidemic transport, seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the French Revolution, is gradually giving place to sanity. It has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery, because a nation of men who had been dupes and slaves for centuries were in- capable of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially loosened.... The revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the demagogues, and the re- establishment of successive tyrannies in France, was terrible, and felt in the remotest corner of the civilized world. Could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread? Can he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become liberal-minded, forbearing, and independent? This is the consequence of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute perseverance and indefatigable hope, and long-suffering and long-believing courage, and the systematic efforts of genera- tions of men of intellect and virtue. Such is the lesson which experience teaches now. But, on the first reverses of hope in the progress of French liberty, the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the solution of these questions, and for a time extinguished itself in the unexpectedness of their result. Thus, many of the most ardent and tender-hearted of the worshippers of public good have been 2 The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. by Roger Ingpen and Walter E.

Hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live, the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair. This influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness of the minds from which it flows. Metaphysics, and inquiries into moral and political science, have become little else than vain attempts to revive exploded superstitions, or sophisms like those of Mr. Malthus, calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting tri- umph. Our works of fiction and poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom. But mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance. I am aware, methinks, of a slow, gradual, silent change. In that belief I have composed the following Poem.6 By the picture of the collapse of the French Revolution the Furies hope to make Prometheus yield to Jupiter: the "first reverses of hope in the progress of French liberty," broke the spirit of many intellectuals (and, here, Shelley is thinking mainly of the generation of Coleridge,7 Southey, and Wordsworth), but others-as we can gather more ex- plicitly from A Philosophical View of Reform--refused to yield. The in- ference is obviously that, in this scene, Shelley is thinking of Prometheus mainly as a symbol of the intellectuals of his own day, and that the Furies are the tormenting thought-images of the aftermath of war and dictatorship of the French Revolution. And these identifications receive further support both from this scene and from other works of Shelley. Let us glance first at the Furies. As the Furies stream up each one announces whence his group has come: the first comes from "red gulfs of war"; the second "From wide cities, famine-wasted"; the third from "Groans half heard, and blood untasted"; the fourth from Kingly conclaves stern and cold, Where blood with gold is bought and sold. (I. 525 ff.) The picture is parallel to that representing the Napoleonic Wars in The 6 Works, I, 241 f. See also Proposals for an Association, Works, v, 264-266, and A Philo- sophical View of Reform, Works, vn, 13-15. For a similar view see Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, m. lxxxi ff. and iv. xcvi ff. 7 It is interesting (and ironical) to note that Coleridge had long before seen the beginning of that retreat of the English liberal thinkers which Shelley here deplores, and which was so soon to engulf Coleridge himself. In the summer of 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: "My dear friend: I do entreat you to go on with 'The Recluse'; and I wish you would write a poem in blank verse, addressed to those, who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hope of the amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophes. It would do great good... .

The parallel between the two scenes goes further. The Furies, we remember, arrive: From the ends of the earth, from the ends of the earth Where the night has its grave and the morning its birth, Come, come, come! (i. 495 ff.) One group arrives first and cries to another-and apparently larger- group to follow: Come, come, come! We are steaming up from Hell's wide gate, And we burthen the blast of the atmosphere, But vainly we toil till ye come here. (I. 517 ff.) This is strikingly similar to the description in The Revolt of Islam of the invading armies of the kings, representing the attack of the other powers of Europe upon France: From every nation of the earth they came, The multitude of heartless moving things, Whom slaves call men: obediently they came ...9 For, from the utmost realms of earth, came pouring The banded slaves whom every despot sent At that throned traitor's summons.'0 Here, too, one group arrives first and is followed by another and larger group (a reference probably to the declaration of war by England, which so shocked the English liberals): "Myriads had come-millions were on their way."" The Furies, however, represent not only the armies of the Napoleonic Wars; they represent all the satellites and agents of court and state by means of which-as well as by its armies-the ruling aristocratic class kept itself in power: We are the ministers of pain and fear, And disappointment, and mistrust, and hate, And clinging crime; and as lean dogs pursue Through wood and lake some struck and sobbing fawn We track all things that weep, and bleed, and live, When the great King betrays them to our will.

These are a set of pelting wretches in whose employment there is nothing to exercise, even to their distortion, the more majestic faculties of the soul.... They eat and drink and sleep, and in the intervals of those things per- formed with most ridiculous ceremony and accompaniments they cringe and lie. ... Their hopes and fears are of the narrowest description. Their domestic affections are feeble, and they have no others. They think of any commerce with their species but as a means, never as an end, and as a means to the basest forms of personal advantage.12 The Furies, then, in their political-historical significance, are those forces by means of which the governing aristocracy, the powers of the Quad- ruple Alliance (assailed by Shelley in the Preface to Hellas) kept itself in power; its vast armies, which had ravaged Europe for a quarter of a century, its crooked judges, lawyers, and moneylenders-with all of whom Shelley had had bitter personal experiences-its bond-holding parasites who had built up the National Debt into an instrument for national oppression.'3 And with the Furies comes Mercury, symbolizing those who carry out the will of the aristocratic class and despise themselves for so doing but are unable to summon up courage for rebellion: I come by the great Father's will driven down, To execute a doom of new revenge. Alas! I pity thee, and hate myself That I can do no more. (I. 354 ff.) These "self-despising slaves of Heaven" realize that when they are no longer of use, their masters will deliver them to the very instruments of destruction of which they are in charge: what if the son of Maia soon Should make us food and sport-who can please long The Omnipotent? (I. 341 f.) This interpretation does not, of course, rule out other interpretations, for Shelley, like Spenser, keeps several strands of allegory running simul- taneously. The Furies represent, also, in a general ethical sense, torment- ing thoughts of all kinds oppressing man, but the main concept which 12 Works, vII, 28-29.

Let us turn, now, to Prometheus. The concept of Prometheus as the intellectuals, the intelligentsia, is inherent in Aeschylus's picture of him as the inventor of all arts and sciences: "Aye, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences, I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative Mother of the Muses' art, wherewith to hold all things in memory."'4 To Bacon, with whose account of the myth Shelley was almost certainly acquainted, Prometheus represents, "the wise and fore-thoughtful class of men," who "bound to the column of Necessity," are "troubled with innumerable thoughts . .which pick and gnaw and corrode."'5 This view of Prometheus clearly fits in very nicely with Shelley's own special theory of the "Poets," those "unacknowledged legislators of the world," who have made possible all human progress: But poets, or those who imagine and express this indestructible order, are not only the authors of language and of music, of the dance and architecture, and statuary and painting; they are the institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society, and the inventors of the arts of life. . ."1B By poets Shelley meant intellectuals of high imaginative quality re- gardless of whether they wrote in prose or verse. His special theory of their function in history was that they both foreshadowed and assisted all important social change. For instance: Shakespeare and Lord Bacon and the great writers of the age of Elizabeth and James the 1st were at once the effects of the new spirit in men's minds, and the cause of its more complete development. By rapid gradation the nation was con- ducted to the mighty example which, "in teaching nations how to live," England afforded to the world-of bringing to public justice one of those chiefs of a con- spiracy whose impunity has been the consecration of crime.'7 The special significance of this theory for our present purpose is that Shelley believed that his own age was one leading up to a great political and cultural advance and that this was being foreshadowed in the in- tellectuals of the day. As he put it in the Preface to Prometheus Unbound: We owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awaken- ing of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the Christian religion. We owe Milton to the progress and development of the 1 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound, Loeb Classical Library, I, 257. 6 De Sapientia Veterum, Works (Boston, n.d.), xi, 153-154. 16 A Defence of Poetry, Works, vn, 112. 17 A Philosophical View of Reform, Works, vu, 7. 733</page><page sequence="7">734 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" same spirit: the sacred Milton was, let it ever be remembered, a republican, and a bold inquirer into morals and religion. The great writers of our own age are, we have reason to suppose, the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it. The cloud of mind is dis- charging its collected lightning, and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring, or is about to be restored.'1 It is this "collected lightning," which is symbolized in the good spirits who come to Prometheus following the attack of the Furies. The spirits represent the capacity of the "poets" to foresee the future: He not only beholds intensely the present as it is, and discovers those laws according to which present things ought to be ordered, but he beholds the future in the present, and his thoughts are the germs of the flower and the fruit of latest time.'9 The first spirit implies that out of the chaos of the Napoleonic Wars a spirit of hope and liberty is arising; the second sings of the growth of a spirit of brotherhood among the armed forces, symbolized by a sailor, following a naval battle, giving his plank to an enemy; the third sings of the development of understanding and hope among scholars; the fourth of the awakening of a new spirit in the poetry of the age; the fifth spirit depicts the horrors of the defeat of the French Revolution; the sixth sings the beautiful lyric: Ah, sister! Desolation is a delicate thing; It walks not on the earth, it floats not on the air, But treads with lulling footsteps, and fans with silent wing, The tender hopes which in their hearts the best and gentlest bear Who, soothed to false repose by the fanning plumes above And the music-stirring motion of its soft and busy feet Dream visions of aerial joy, and call the monster, Love, And wake, and find the shadow Pain, as he whom now we greet. (I. 695-779) The clue to this lyric-which, like many of Shelley's lyrics, has been more praised than explained20-is to be found in the passage already quoted in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam on the collapse of the French Revolution: The sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom. The most generous and amiable natures were those which participated most extensively in these sympathies. But such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it 18 Works, ii, 173. My italics.

Thus many of the most ardent and tender-hearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared to show as the melancholy desola- tion of their cherished hopes. Hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live.... n The French Revolution arose, not from a sober realization that a basic change was needed, but from unbearable oppression, from "Desola- tion";22 and so, too, in "desolation" it ended. Its parent was not Freedom but Famine.23 But the intellectuals, forgetting this origin-which fore- doomed it to failure-were enthusiastic and hopeful. Thus "Desolation" "soothed to a false repose" and betrayed "the tenderest hopes which in their hearts the best and gentlest bear": "Thus many of the most ardent and tenderhearted of the worshippers of the public good have been morally ruined...." "Desolation" is, therefore, in its tenuously decep- tive character, a "delicate thing," blinding men to all but the stirring impulses which it temporarily produces and hiding the ultimate reaction -"pain"-which it inevitably results in. Instead of a democratic order based on Love there arises only the new desolation of militaristic dictator- ship out of the old desolation of feudalism and revolution. The spirits then sing in chorus that although the world is now domi- nated by death and ruin (the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars), Pro- metheus will conquer these forces; this conquest, this rise of a new order, they compare to the ripening of buds with the passing of winter-"From Spring gathering up beneath"-; and this concept is carried over into the opening of the next act: thou hast descended Cradled in tempests; thou dost wake, O Spring! O child of many winds! One more central point of interpretation regarding Prometheus yet remains, his revocation of the curse upon Jupiter: It doth repent me: words are quick and vain; Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine. I wish no living thing to suffer pain. (I. 303-305) This has generally been taken to signify the growth of love in the hearts of mankind, which will somehow (miraculously, according to some critics) bring about the millennium. But Shelley's meaning is much less abstract than this, the key to it to be found not in the generalities of ethics (or metaphysics) but in the specific doctrines of the political science of the time. In order to grasp this meaning--around which the 21 Works, I, 241-242. 2 See A Philosophical View of Reform, Works, vn, 13. 23 Swellfoot the Tyrant, ii. ii. 42 ff., 84 if. 735</page><page sequence="9">736 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" central message of the drama revolves-we must turn, once more, to his theories on the role of the intellectual in historical development. The French Revolution, he contended, had failed because the masses "having been rendered brutal, ignorant, servile and bloody by long slavery,"24 had turned to an orgy of violence and revenge which led to militaristic dictatorship: If there had never been war,25 there could never have been tyranny in the world; tyrants take advantage of the mechanical organization of armies to establish and defend their encroachments. It is thus that the mighty advantages of the French Revolution have been almost completely compensated by a succession of tyrants (for demagogues, oligarchies, usurpers and legitimate kings are merely varieties of the same class) from Robespierre to Louis 18.26 Such a disaster could have been prevented only-he had decided as early as 1812-if there had been more French intellectuals to lead the masses and keep them from going to extremes: Had there been more of those men France would not now be a beacon to warn us of the hazard and horror of Revolutions, but a pattern for society, rapidly advancing to a state of perfection, and holding out an example for the gradual and peaceful regeneration of the world.27 And now, when he believed the world was on the threshold of new ad- vances similar to those of the early days of the French Revolution, all would be lost unless the intellectuals of his own age could assume the leadership of the movement. "The change," he wrote in August, 1819- the year of the composition of Prometheus-"must commence among the higher orders, or anarchy will be the last flash before despotism."28 In A Defense of Poetry he places the dilemma more succinctly: 24 Works, vn, 13. 26 The context shows that Shelley is thinking mainly of civil war following revolution. 26 Works, vn, 53-54; cf. p. 14. 27 Works, v, 265. 28 Works, x, 74. The whole "anarchy-despotism" question was one of the most common points of dispute in the political literature of the time. The argument was that revolution would produce mob rule (anarchy) and that this would lead to a renewal of the dictator- ship of the military and aristocracy (despotism). Shelley-who was brought up to be a Whig Member of Parliament-may have encoun- tered the problem first in the Whig debates. Pitt, the Tory leader, used to charge that the Whigs by agitating for reform were breeding revolution and urged that they "check their wishes rather than to risk the inlet of Jacobin principles and avoid the imprudence of affording to the enemies of the constitution the means of accomplishing its destruction." The standard Whig reply (made in this particular debate by Fox) was that it was the Tory policy of repression which was goading the people to revolution and that the Whig reform plan was the only means of avoiding it. Hansard, Parliamentary Debates (1797), xxxm, 644 ff. Shelley must certainly also have been aware of Godwin's treatment of this problem: "We have hitherto argued upon the supposition that the attempt which shall be made to effect a revolution, shall be crowned with success. But this supposition must by no means</page><page sequence="10">Kenneth Neill Cameron The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despot- ism.29 The prevention of mass violence is, in The Revolt of Islam, the main function entrusted to Laon (who represents, as does Prometheus, the "Poets" of the age) when he is sent into the revolution: If blood be shed, 'tis but a change and choice Of bonds-from slavery to cowardice A wretched fall! Uplift thy charmed voice Pour on those evil men the love that lies Hovering within those spirit-soothing eyes.30 This, too, is the plea of Freedom to Famine in Swellfoot the Tyrant: by thy dread self, O Famine!

Every attempt of this sort, even if menaced only and not carried into effect, tends to excite a resistance which otherwise would never be con- solidated.... Amidst the barbarous rage of war, and the clamorous din of civil contention, who shall tell whether the event will be prosperous or adverse? The consequence may be, the riveting on us anew the chains of despotism, and insuring through a considerable period the triumph of oppression, even if it should fail to carry us back to a state of torpor, and obliterate the memory of all our improvements."

For Shelley's echoing of Coleridge in this passage, see my article, "Shelley and the Conciones ad Populum," Modern Language Notes, Lvn (December, 1942), 673-674. Shelley's theories on the lessons of the French Revolution are remarkably similar to those Coleridge presents in this work. Coleridge's views may be succinctly stated as follows: there were many great and admirable leaders in France but they were unable to restrain the masses from violence; the main problem in England, con- sequently, is to eradicate the idea of "retribution" from the hearts of the people and to bring about an "illumination" producing "benevolent affections" before any major change takes place; this can best be done by "a small but glorious band" of educated reformers who will look forward to a "glorious period when justice will have established the universal fraternity of love." (Coleridge, "Conciones ad Populum," Essays on his Own Times [Lon- don, 1850], pp. 7-17.) 32 For an elucidation of Shelley's views in The Mask of Anarchy see A Philosophical View of Reform, Works, vn, 48 f. 737</page><page sequence="11">738 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" Here, then, we have the key to the change in Prometheus, which re- sults in his revocation of the curse upon Jupiter. The intellectuals of the age are beginning to realize that they must erase all thought of revenge from their hearts in order to lead the coming revolution into peaceful channels,3 and, so, avoid anarchy. This change, Shelley believed, had been slowly and silently taking place for some time and was the main force behind that great cultural revival which he considered one of the outstanding characteristics of his age. The aristocrats, however, per- ceived the change also; in alarm, they sent all their forces of defeatist propaganda-using the collapse of the French Revolution as their main weapon-to break the spirits of the intellectuals: Jupiter dispatched the Furies to attack Prometheus. But it was this change, too, which set in motion the mighty forces of Asia and Demogorgon for the ultimate over- throw of Jupiter. Asia, Panthea, and lone The correctness of the traditional interpretation of Asia as Love is evidenced by the words of Prometheus at the disappearance of the spirits: How fair these airborn shapes! and yet I feel Most vain all hope but love; and thou art far Asia! It is important to define Shelley's conception of love, however, and note its connection with the theories already examined. The great secret of morals-he writes in A Defence of Poetry-is love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action or person, not our own. A man to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.34 By Love, Shelley meant a spirit of generous comradeship and brother- hood; its opposite is selfishness: Selfishness is the offspring of ignorance and mistake; it is the portion of un- 8 In spite of Shelley's aversion to violence, he was prepared to support a revolution, if it broke out, and take a chance on anarchy resulting: "In case the subsisting Government should compell the people to revolt to establish a representative assembly in defiance of them, and to assume in that assembly an attitude of resistance and defence, this question would probably be answered in a very summary manner.-No friend of mankind and of his country can desire that such a crisis should suddenly arrive; but still less, once having arrived, can he hesitate under what banner to array his person and his powers." And again: "The last resort of resistance is undoubtedly insurrection.-The right of insurrection is derived from the employment of armed force to counteract the will of the nation."

In the existing order, Shelley believed, this was of especial importance because that order tended to breed, not love and unselfishness, but hate and selfishness. As he wrote in the Essay on Christianity: In proportion as mankind becomes wise, yes, in exact proportion to that wisdom should be the extinction of the unequal system under which they now subsist. Government is in fact the mere badge of their depravity. They are so little aware of the inestimable benefits of mutual love as to indulge without thought and almost without motive in the worst excesses of selfishness and malice. Hence without graduating human society into a scale of empire and subjection, its very existence has become impossible. It is necessary that universal benevolence should supersede the regulations of precedent and prescription, before these regulations can safely be abolished. Meanwhile their very subsistence depends on the system of injustice and violence which they have been devised to palliate. ... The whole frame of human things is infected by the insidious poison.36 Such would not be the case in a society based upon equality, as we can see from the description of the life of the Assassins: Every impulse conspired to one end, and tended to a single object. Each devoted his powers to the happiness of the other. Their republic was the scene of the perpetual contentions of benevolence.37 To this let us add the following comments from the essay On Love: This is Love. This is the bond and the sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every thing which exists.38 Hence in solitude, or in that deserted state when we are surrounded by human beings, and yet they sympathize not with us, we love the flowers, the grass, and the waters, and the sky.39 We are now in a position to see Shelley's meaning more fully. The essence of selfishness is a turning in upon the self, a refusal to consider the interests of one's fellows; the essence of love is a turning of the self outward to sympathy and fellowship not only with one's fellow beings but with the world of nature as well. In a society based on equalitarian laws this feeling is allowed to develop; but in the existing order, based on 35 Speculations on Morals, Works, vi, 76. 36 Works, vi, 249. 37 The Assassins, Works, vi, 162. 38 Works, vr, 201. 39 Ibid., p. 202. 739</page><page sequence="13">740 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" inequality and oppression, it is thwarted; love has been driven from the hearts of men by the despotic state: Asia has been separated from Prometheus by Jupiter. Only by the reuniting of the two, i.e., only when men begin to think in terms not of the individual but of humanity, can a new order of equality and justice be achieved. This, I believe, is the essence of Shelley's meaning here. On the identity of Panthea and Ione, we have no definite statement in the poem; the interminable reiteration of "Panthea: Faith; Ione: Hope" has nothing to support it. The key to Shelley's meaning is to be found, I believe, in the following passage in the Letter to Maria Gisborne (1820): You are not here! the quaint witch Memory sees In vacant chairs, your absent images, And points where once you sat, and now should be But are not.-I demand if ever we Shall meet as then we met;-and she replies, Veiling in awe her second-sighted eyes; 'I know the past alone-but summon home My sister Hope,-she speaks of all to come.'40 To this, let us add Shelley's allusion in Prince Athanase to "the veiled eye of memory"4' and compare it with Ione's picture of herself: My wings are folded o'er mine ears: My wings are crossed o'er mine eyes; Yet through their silver shade appears, And through their lulling plumes arise, A shape, a throng of sounds. (i. 222 ff.) Ione, it would seem, represents Memory, and Panthea her "sister Hope"; their dwelling with Prometheus probably signifies, in terms of the politi- cal allegory, that the hope of a new order, in the future, and the memories of past struggles for liberty-treated, for instance, in the Ode to Liberty, the first chorus in Hellas, and the first chapter of A Philosophical View of Reform-live on in the hearts of mankind despite all the efforts of despotism to erase them. The feudal state can take Love away, but not Hope or Memory. Ione is never able to see the future or to understand present action passing into the future. For instance, she is never able to understand where the various "spirits," which appear in the course of the drama, have gone, knowing only that they have left the present, and asking, "Where are the spirits fled?" (I. 801) or "Have they passed?" (iv. 34), and once crying out, when informed that they have gone: "Yet feel you no delight from the past sweetness?" (Iv. 180). (My italics.)

She cannot understand things as can Panthea, for, as Shelley implies in A Defence of Poetry the type of mind which functions on mechanical reasoning from past events cannot have the comprehension of the truly imaginative intellect. It is not enough to see "but the past in the To-come";42 only those who have undying hope, who will "hope till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates,"43 can foresee the future, and, thus, really under- stand the present. It is hope which keeps alive some vestiges of unselfishness and brother- hood in the hearts of the "Poets" when the despotic state has driven love from them; Panthea is the intermediary between Asia and Prometheus. She is the companion of Asia, as Ione is not, for Hope is more important in the achieving of a new order than is Memory. A similar association of Hope and Love will be found in The Mask of Anarchy (written in the same year as Prometheus Unbound): when the maiden Hope flings herself in the path of the oncoming pageant of reaction-"between her and her foes / A mist, a light, an image rose"-and this image grows into a winged shape, identified, by the symbol of the star Venus on its helmet, as Love. This Shape then passes over the land awakening the people to a struggle for liberty: Hope arouses Love, and Love arouses mankind.44 In Pro- metheus Unbound, Hope brings to Love two messages, one-her second dream-on the spread of love in the hearts of the "Poets" (the trans- formation of Prometheus), one on the coming of revolution-the "shape" of the "forgotten" first dream-with its promise of the future (the "golden dew" of dawn) and its roughness- What is that shape between us? Its rude hair Roughens the wind that lifts it, its regard Is wild and quick, yet 'tis a thing of air, For through its gray robe gleams the golden dew Whose stars the noon has quenched not.

We may remember also that in the Preface to Prometheus Unbound the two are linked: "until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope."

(I. 133-141) The blighting of the tree is once more a symbol of the fall of the French Revolution, the "follow, follow," stamped on its leaves hints that in the Cave of Demogorgon new forces of progress are about to be released; and this is signified, also, in the avalanche which the sisters see just before entering the cave. The not-infrequent suggestions that Demogorgon is Destiny or Ne- cessity or Fate are certainly on the right track, but fail to bring out the specific significance of the character, at least in so far as his political- historical meaning is concerned. He is not only Necessity or Fate in a general sense but Necessity in the special, semi-scientific sense given to the concept by Godwin and Hume,45 and reiterated by Shelley in the Notes on Queen Mab: He who asserts the doctrine of Necessity means that, contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe, he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects, no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy, or act in any other place than it does act.46 Not only is the physical world subject to these blind and immutable forces; the world of human society, human history, is governed by them also. In the contemporary historical situation, these forces were, Shelley believed, inexorably working for the overthrow of the old order and the establishment of a new: The distribution of wealth, no less than the spirit by which it is upheld and that by which it is assailed, render the event inevitable. Call it reform or revolution, as you will, a change must take place; one of the consequences of which will be, the wresting of political power from those who are at present the depositaries of it.47 45 For the influence of Hume on Shelley's doctrine of Necessity see: Frank B.

Necessity is introduced in Queen Mab as the "Soul of the Universe" and the "Spirit of Nature": Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, Necessity! Thou mother of the world.48 It is represented in both Queen Mab and The Daemon of the World as pervading the whole frame of things: Yet not the slightest leaf That quivers to the passing breeze Is less instinct with thee.49 Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffused A Spirit of activity and life. .. .6 Demogorgon, likewise, is omnipresent, the "Spirit of Nature," the "Soul of the Universe": A mighty power, which is as darkness Is rising out of the Earth, and from the sky Is showered like light, and from within the air Bursts.... .6 Necessity (and the Daemon)62 is immortal, "imperishable": A Spirit of activity and life That knows no term, cessation, or decay That fades not.3 Demogorgon is hailed as "the Eternal, the Immortal."5 The Spirits speak of Demogorgon's mighty law" ;5 Necessity "presides, apportioning with irresistible law."66 The Daemon lives on "an isolated pinnacle"; the cave of Demogorgon is in "the fatal mountain"57 (i.e., the mountain of fate), below "A Pinnacle of Rock among Mountains."58 48 Queen Mab, vi. 197-198. 49 The Daemon of the World, II. 186 f. 60 Queen Mab, vi. 146 f. 61 Prometheus Unbound, iv. 510 ff. 52 The Daemon of the World, n. 186 f. 63 Queen Mab, vi. 148 f. 64 Prometheus Unbound, n. iii. 95. 56 Ibid., ii. ii. 43. 66 Queen Mab, vi. 162. 57 The Daemon of the World, I. 287; Prometheus Unbound, r. ii. 62.

Lotspeich, "Shelley's Eternity and Demogorgon," Philological Quarterly, xn (1934), 309-311, and my article, "A Major Source of The Revolt of Islam," PMLA, LVI (1941), 201-205.

Why is she told- In a world unknown Sleeps a voice unspoken; By thy step alone Can its rest be broken-? (n. i. 190 ff.) Shelley does not mean that Necessity can act only if assisted by Love, nor does he anywhere state, as some critics assume, that Necessity is controlled by Love.60 Necessity is a blind ineluctable force acting inde- pendently of the mind or wishes of man. The key to Shelley's meaning in this lyric is to be found in those views on anarchy and despotism which we have already encountered. In the specific historical situation of his own age the powers of Necessity were making for an overthrow of the existing social order, but if those powers acted without the aid of the spirit of love and brotherhood all their efforts would be vain and a new despotism would arise. Demogorgon can overthrow the old order without the aid of Asia, but he cannot build a new one unless she assists him. The same idea is expressed once more in the song of the Spirits to Asia: Such strength is in meekness That the Eternal, the Immortal, Must unloose through life's portal The snake-like Doom coiled underneath his throne By that alone. (In. iii. 94 ff.) 69 The Revolt of Islam, x. xxvii; cf. Hellas, n. 711-712: "The world's eyeless charioteer, Destiny, is hurrying by!" 60 As is implied, perhaps, in White, op. cit., n, 126, where it is asserted that "the sub- stitution of Love for Necessity" forms "one of the greatest differences" between Pro- metheus Unbound and Queen Mab. There is, however no substitution; Necessity plays the same role in Prometheus Unbound as it does in Queen Mab but in the later work it is assisted by Love. Demogorgon's statement that Love is not subject to "Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change" (I. iv. 118-120) does not mean that Love rules over these entities, but only that they and Love belong to two different spheres of existence. Cf. Epipsychidion. 11. 160-189.</page><page sequence="18">Kenneth Neill Cameron The eternal powers of historical necessity ("the Eternal, the Immortal") can give liberty (the "snake-like Doom")'6 to humanity only if assisted by love ("meekness"). Once she has arrived in this cave, Asia, we remember, questions Demo- gorgon on the nature of God and the origin of evil. As to the nature of God he can only answer: I spoke but as ye speak For Jove is the supreme of living things. (iI. iv. 113-114) Why can he not speak more specifically? The answer, I believe, is to be found in the following passage on the laws of necessity in A Refutation of Deism: The greatest equally with the smallest motions of the Universe, are subjected to the rigid necessity of inevitable laws. These laws are the unknown causes of known effects perceivable in the Universe. Their efforts are the boundaries of our knowledge, their names the expressions of our ignorance. To suppose some existence beyond or above them, is to invent a second and superfluous hypothesis for what has already been accounted for by the laws of motion and the properties of matter. I admit that the nature of these laws is incomprehensible, but the hypothesis of a Deity adds a gratuitous difficulty, which so far from alleviating those which it is adduced to explain, requires new hypotheses for the elucidation of its own inherent contradictions.2 According to the doctrine of Necessity, then, the only field that can become intelligible to man is that of the material world as he perceives it. There may be a supernatural force somewhere beyond these laws, but it is vain to hope for any knowledge of such a force; such hypotheses are outside the field of the doctrine of Necessity. Nor was this position changed by Shelley's shift from materialism to idealism, except, perhaps, in so far as he later seemed more willing to grant the legitimacy of speculation on the existence of an unknown power. For, although Shelley later believed that the substance of the universe was spiritual and not material, he did not-as did Berkeley- view this mind substance as God. Mind, he had learned from Locke, was perceptive and not creative; and this, he felt, must apply to a cosmic mind substance as well as to the individual mind; there must exist some- where beyond the visible universe, regardless of whether that universe be material or spiritual in essence, some creative force of an unknown, and probably unknowable, nature: Mind, as far as we have any experience of its properties, and beyond that ex- perience how vain is argument! cannot create, it can only perceive.... It is 61 See the discussion of Shelley's use of snake symbols in my article, "A Major Source of The Revolt of Islam," PMLA, LVI, 201-205. 62 Works, vi, 48-49. 745</page><page sequence="19">746 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" infinitely improbable that the cause of mind, that is, of existence, is similar to mind.6 Demogorgon, therefore, is as unable as were Necessity or the Daemon, to describe the nature of any force existing beyond the realm of things as they are. In regard to Demogorgon's failure to answer the question on the origin of evil, the following comments on the nature of Necessity in Queen Mab provide us with a clue: all that the wide world contains Are but thy passive instruments, and thou Regardest them all with an impartial eye, Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel, Because thou art not human sense, Because thou art not human mind.6 To this Shelley adds the following note: The doctrine of Necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have hap- pened otherwise than it did happen, and that if God is the author of good, He is also the author of evil.... We are taught by the doctrine of Necessity, that there is neither good nor evil in the universe, otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being.66 Necessity is not human mind, and does not regard things from the same point of view as do human beings. (In fact, it cannot really be said to regard things at all, but acts with the same blind, ineluctable force in society as in the material universe.) And moral categories-as Spinoza had pointed out6"-do not exist for "the laws of motion" either in nature or society. These are purely the invention of the "human mind." To Necessity, therefore, the problem of good or evil is irrelevant, even non- existent; Demogorgon has no answer to Asia's question. Once the junction of Demogorgon and Asia is effected, once, that is to say, the immutable tides of historical evolution are assisted by the spirit of brotherhood among men, great social forces are unleashed. Two chariots appear, one driven by a "ghastly Charioteer" of "dreadful countenance," the second driven by a young and beautiful spirit. The first is the Hour of the revolutionary overthrow of the old order; with it Demogorgon ascends; the blind forces of Necessity will crush the aristo- cratic state. The second is the Hour of the birth of the new order; for 63 On Life, Works, vi, 197. " Queen Mab, vi. 214 ff. M Works, I, 145-146. 66 See, for instance, the Appendix to Ethics 1.

As they mount, the spirit sings: On the brink of the night and the morning My coursers are wont to respire; But the earth has just whispered a warning That their flight must be swifter than fire; They shall drink the hot speed of desire! To this Asia replies: Thou breathest on their nostrils, but my breath Would give them swifter speed. And the Spirit answers: "Alas! it could not." Why this necessity for haste? What is the "warning" that the Earth has just whispered? Why will not the power of Asia (Love) increase the speed of the Car of the Hour? The answer to all these questions is inherent in action and views al- ready given. The warning which the earth has whispered is that the hour of revolution is at hand-the car of Demogorgon had preceded that of Asia-and that unless Love arrive quickly it will degenerate into an- archy. Love, however, cannot hasten the arrival of the hour of the new order for that is set by Necessity. Love may or may not arrive with the Hour; if it does the hour will mature and the new order be born: if it does not-as in the French Revolution-the hour will be aborted and fade; but Love can neither hasten nor retard its arrival. In the beautiful lyrics that follow-"Life of Life" and "My soul is an enchanted boat"-Shelley is symbolizing the great and intense love which will flow over the world when the hearts of men are freed from the thwarting tyranny of the despotic state,67 love as the spirit of brother- hood among man, love as "the bond and sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every thing which exists." The emphasis here is ethical and metaphysical as well as political, the matter remi- niscent of Plato and Dante (in whose similar visions the "light" motif also dominates). It may appear, at first sight, that this second act has little connection with the action of the first. Such, however, is not the case. Shelley is depicting in it the workings beneath the surface of history of those forces which are gathering up, as a result of the movements engendered by the American and French revolutions, for the overthrow of the aristocratic state and the establishment of a new order. It is a symbolic picture of 67 The second of these lyrics symbolizes the future union of Love and the spiritual leaders of mankind, the Poets, for the "Voice in the Air," the third and fourth lines indicate, is that of Prometheus. 747</page><page sequence="21">748 The Political Symbolism of "Prometheus Unbound" that "unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions that cement it" which he speaks of in the preface, the "Spring gathering up beneath" heralded in the final chorus of the Spirits in the first act and hailed by Asia at the beginning of the second. Taking the two acts to- gether we have a representation in poetic form of the historical move- ments and theories presented in the first chapter of A Philosophical View of Reform. In the third act, the forces depicted in the first two burst through to the surface of history, the "winter of the world" is banished, and "Spring," the spring of a new order, is born. Jupiter, Thetis, and their "Child" A fourth, and final, group of problems in the political allegory occur in the scene depicting the overthrow of Jupiter by Demogorgon. The scene opens in "Heaven" with Jupiter on his throne. That Jupiter, as most students of the poem have contended, represents tyranny is un- deniable. In terms of the political allegory, however, as distinct from the general social allegory, he represents not just tyranny but the tyrannical rule of Metternich, Castlereagh, and their satellites, the tyranny of the Holy Alliance, to the overthrow of which Shelley looked forward: Well do these destroyers of mankind know their enemy, when they impute the insurrection in Greece to the same spirit before which they tremble throughout the rest of Europe, and that enemy well knows the power and the cunning of its opponents, and watches the moment of their approaching weakness and in- evitable division to wrest the bloody sceptres from their grasp.68 Jupiter believes that his wife, Thetis, will help to render his reign eternal; but she is not really eternity, only that "bright image of eter- nity" which, according to Plato, is "time";69 hence Thetis represents the false hopes of the despots for the perpetuation of their rule (a theme prominent in Hellas). On her Jupiter has begotten a "fatal child, the terror of the earth," whom he has sent to take the place of Demogorgon,70 and whose triumphant return he is now awaiting. 68 Works, Im, 10. 69 Timaeus, xiv. Shelley perhaps also had in mind Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, iv. clxxxiii on the sea: Dark-heaving-boundless, endless, and sublime, The image of eternity, the throne Of the Invisible. Thetis was a sea goddess and hence part of this mirror of the sky (Eternity). 70 White (op. cit., n, 119), following Todhunter and Scudder, thinks that Demogorgon himself is the "fatal child" whom Jupiter has created: "When Demogorgon arrives in the Car of the Hour, Jupiter hails him gladly as his expected offspring." But this is not so. Jupiter, hearing the approach of Demogorgon, rejoices, thinking that it is the "fatal child"</page><page sequence="22">Kenneth Neill Cameron What is meant by the "fatal child"? The answer, I believe, is contained in Shelley's comments on "anarchy" in his address on the death of the Princess Charlotte: Many and various are the mischiefs flowing from oppression, but this is the representative of them all; namely that one man is forced to labour for another in a degree not only necessary to the support of the subsisting distinctions among mankind, but so as by the excess of the injustice to endanger the very founda- tions of all that is valuable in social order, and to provoke that anarchy which is at once the enemy of freedom, and the child and chastiser of misrule.7 It is the same concept as that in The Mask of Anarchy, when the ruling classes elevate Anarchy to the position of God and Law: Then all cried with one accord, 'Thou art King, and God, and Lord; Anarchy, to thee we bow, Be thy name made holy now!'72 Why, though, is Jupiter so hopeful of perpetuating his reign if the "fatal child," Anarchy, can dethrone Demogorgon? The answer lies, once more, in Shelley's belief that the despots of Europe were, by their op- pressive policies, driving the people to a revolution which would bring "anarchy" as the "last flash" before a new "despotism."73 It is by means of this "anarchy-despotism" cycle that Satan (representing tyranny) in the Prologue to Hellas, sneeringly threatens to defeat all attempts to achieve a new order: The first is Anarchy; when Power and Pleasure, Glory and science and security, On freedom hang like fruit on the green tree, Then pour it forth and men shall gather ashes.74 To this Christ replies that the despots may think (as does Jupiter) that they can perpetuate their reign by these means, but this is only because they are unable to realize that the future will not follow the same pattern as the past: Obdurate spirit! Thou seest but the Past in the To-come. Pride is thy error and thy punishment.76 arriving; when he sees Demogorgon, however, he does not, at all, "hail him gladly," but starts back in consternation: "Awful shape, what art thou? Speak!" Cf. Grabo, The Magic Plant, p. 279: "He [Jupiter] has created a monster to supplant the might of Demogorgon, personification of Fate." The child exists in spirit only and is to receive body from Demo- gorgon: i.e., take the place of Necessity. 71 Works, vi, 79.

It was part of his general philosophy, derived from Hume and Godwin, that in a state of anarchy Necessity could not operate, for Necessity can operate only in an ordered universe, one whose component parts, in nature and society, bear a definite relationship to each other: Were the doctrine of Necessity false-wrote Shelley in his Notes to Queen Mab- the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science; from like causes it would be vain that we should expect like effects; the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct; all knowledge would be vain and indeterminate; we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy tomorrow him from whom we have parted in friendship to- night.... None but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their God with the misery of man, will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause, a voluntary action without a motive.76 In a world without Necessity the ruling classes might be able to pre- serve their power indefinitely; but all efforts to obtain such a state of anarchy fail because Necessity is inherent in the nature of the universe; Demogorgon is, as we have already noted, omnipresent, the "Soul of the Universe." Hence Jupiter, like the rulers in The Mask of Anarchy, fails in his purpose. But what does Demogorgon mean when he calls himself the "child" of Jupiter? Necessity clearly operated in the world before the appearance of the despotic state, and Demogorgon, in medieval lore, is older than Jupiter (in the curious "trees" in Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Gods, for instance, he is placed above Jupiter). There is, however, one sense in which Demogorgon could be the child of Jupiter; despotism-as Paine, Godwin, and others preached-breeds the conditions for its own over- throw; the despotic state, once established, sets in motion economic and political forces, which will of Necessity, eventually overthrow it: "The distribution of wealth, no less than the spirit by which it is upheld and that by which it is assailed render the event inevitable."77 In this sense, then, Necessity, as a force acting in the realm of history-where it is most commonly represented as acting by the radical thinkers of the time -was engendered by the despotic state; Demogorgon was the child of Jupiter. And this is the secret that the advanced thinkers of mankind (Prometheus) have ever known andfor which they have been persecuted throughout history; this is the secret for which Prometheus has been chained to the rock by Jupiter. He knew that the "real" child of Jupiter (of whom it was proph- n Fragments on Reform, Works, vi, 295. 76 Works, I, 144.</page><page sequence="24">Kenneth Neill Cameron esied in the Greek myth that he would overthrow his father) was not the "fatal child" Anarchy but Demogorgon (Necessity) himself, i.e., that despotism sows the seeds of its own decay and will inevitably, in spite of all its efforts to survive, be banished from the earth. Why is the "fatal child" unable to conquer Demogorgon and "stamp out the spark" of human progress? He was defeated because Necessity had been reinforced by Love (Asia) and the anarchy-despotism cycle thus cancelled. But this Jupiter did not know. He realized that some form of transformation had come over Prometheus with the renunciation of the curse-the despots feared the rise of the intellectuals-and sent the Furies to subdue him, but he had not realized that the spirit of love and brotherhood was to spread over the world and thwart all his efforts, rendering his system of state oppression useless-"the elements obey me not" (III. i. 80). The charge has been made that, in this scene, Shelley depicts the over- throw of Jupiter as taking place too swiftly. But we must not forget, that Shelley is not, as in A Philosophical View of Reform, giving a de- tailed account of political events but a symbolic picture of vast forces. That he was under no delusions on the difficulty of overthrowing the aristocratic state or the length of time it would take is clear from his political writings. We have to presume the passing of time and the oc- currence of a mighty struggle shadowed in the words of Jupiter to his silent and inexorable opponent Demogorgon. One further point is involved in Demogorgon's reply when Jupiter asks his name: "Eternity, Demand no direr name." The meaning here is metaphysical as well as political, referring to the Platonic distinction between Time and Eternity: that which is most real and powerful is of the nature of Eternity, that which is unreal and fleeting is of the nature of time. Demogorgon does not mean that he is Eternity78-the "direr" name is, doubtless, "Necessity"-but only that he is of an eternal nature. In Boccaccio he is the companion of the goddess Eternity,79 but is not himself Eternity. Once Jupiter is overthrown, once, that is to say, that the feudal state with its soul-corrupting "institutions" is obliterated, the spirit of love and brotherhood is able to return to the hearts of the "Poets"; Asia joins Prometheus and he is freed from the rock. He is freed, however, not by Love but by Hercules, signifying, according to both Shelley (iII. iii. 1) and Mary Strength.80 By this Shelley, I presume, means that 78 As White (op. cit., n, 118, 119), Rossetti, and others believe. 79 Henry G.

The main function of these leaders, the "Poets" in the new order is to be the development of the arts and sciences. This is signified by the retire- ment of Prometheus to a cave near the altar to him in Plato's academy.82 In this cave he and Asia are to be visited by the progeny immortal Of Painting, Sculpture, and rapt Poesy, And arts, though unimagined, yet to be. (ni. iii. 54-56) As to the nature of this new social order, it is, clearly, the equalitarian state as envisaged in A Philosophical View of Reform83 and other works, and embodies the basic concepts of Godwin, Condorcet, Paine, Volney, and others. In the period between the appearance of Demogorgon before the throne of Jupiter and the transformation reported by the Spirit of the Hour a great historical era of revolutions and reforms, of republican states accomplished only after "generations"84 of effort and passing slowly into a world equalitarian state must be imagined. When, in 1820 and 1821, Shelley saw the revolutions in Spain, Naples, and Greece, he hailed these events as confirmation of his view of the direction of history. The fourth act, although a magnificent hymning of the new world order, (in which, as Professor Grabo has shown,8 man controls nature by sci- general, have the virtue of treating the poem primarily as a representation of an action; but Shelley apparently did not discuss with her the more specific meanings of his symbols and she seems to have interpreted the poem only in the light of her general knowledge of his social philosophy. 81 Works, vn, 42-55. 82 See Edward B. Hungerford, Shores of Darkness (New York, 1941), pp. 194-202. 83 Works, vii, 42-43: "Equality in possessions must be the last result of the utmost refinements of civilization; it is one of the conditions of that system of society, towards which with whatever hope of ultimate success, it is our duty to tend. We may and ought to advert to it as the elementary principle, as to the goal, unattainable, perhaps, by us, but which, as it were, we revive in our posterity to pursue. We derive tranquillity and courage and grandeur of soul from contemplating an object which is, because we will it, and may be, because we hope and desire it, and must be if succeeding generations of the enlightened sincerely and earnestly seek it." (My italics.) 84 See Preface to Hellas, Works, iI, 9: "But a new race has arisen throughout Europe, nursed in the abhorrence of the opinions which are its chains, and she will continue to produce fresh generations to accomplish that destiny which tyrants foresee and dread." 88 See A Newton among Poets, pp. 118-200.</page><page sequence="26">Kenneth Neill Cameron ence) introduces no new characters of historical or political significance, and so its examination is not pertinent to this study. Following this lyrical picture, Demogorgon comes forward to deliver the final message: Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom and Endurance, These are the seals of that most firm assurance Which bars the pit over Destruction's strength; And if, with infirm hand, Eternity, Mother of many acts and hours, should free The serpent that would clasp her with his length These are the spells by which to reassume An empire o'er the disentangled doom. The key to Demogorgon's meaning is to be found in the following passage from A Philosophical View of Reform: A Republic, however just in its principles and glorious in its object would through the violence and sudden change which must attend it, incur a great risk of being as rapid in its decline as in its growth. It is better that they [the people] should be instructed in the whole truth; that they should see the clear grounds of their rights, the objects to which they ought to tend; and be impressed with the just persuasion that patience and reason and endurance are the means of a calm yet irresistible progress. A civil war, which might be engendered by the passions attending on this mode of reform, would confirm in the mass those military habits which have already been introduced by our tyrants and with which liberty is incompatible.86 If, in the future, the eternal powers of the new equalitarian society, grow weak ("infirm") and the forces of liberty (the serpent) get so out of control as to threaten "civil war" ("Destruction's strength")87-and, hence, the anarchy-despotism cycle-things can be again brought under control if the people are instructed in "patience, reason and endurance" ("Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom, and Endurance"). Demogorgon's final speech is thus a repetition of the central message of the whole poem. KENNETH NEILL CAMERON Indiana University 86 Works, vii, 41. 87 Cf.
