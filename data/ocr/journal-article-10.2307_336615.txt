<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON "EL SE1OR PRESIDENTE" By MIGUEL ANGEL ASTURIAS RICHARD L. FRANKLIN Minneapolis, Minnesota The repulsive omniscence of the state in El Seiior Presidente might be thought only an imaginary world out of 1984 were it not for its historical model in the fantastic regime of Estrada Cabrera (1898-1920). Many of its incidents are real and may be read elsewhere in the few annals avail- able today.' This work contains no hero and no heroine. Its only characters are so-called "flat characters" which enter and leave at the will of the author. If we look for a thesis, it is difficult to locate and harder still to express. Nevertheless, in a philo- sophical sense, Asturias has eloquently af- firmed the validity of individual experience. Placed within the huge frame of reference of the state, our most frequently viewed character, Cara de Angel, struggles to af- firm his absolute existence and to relate this to an authentic self. So also do Asturias' entire pitiful chamber of beggars, idiots, prostitutes, generals, and hirelings blindly grope for the means to assert the validity of self and to anchor this individ- uality in a nightmare which constantly faces it with black nothingness. Asturias has created in brilliant fashion a grotesque and asphyxiating conception of the total state. Running the whole gamut of literary devices, he has mixed essence and form to overcome a difficult task in a very effective manner. On the one hand there is poetic exploration into the inner- most recesses and realities of the human mind. On the other, there is the material content of an urban mass caught in the grip of an iron regime. The synthesis of these two disparate elements into a unified literary whole is a real contribu- tion to the novelistic genre of America. Asturias' accomplishment has had ante- cedent efforts and similiar examples. Jos6i Eustasio Rivera in his La Vorigine at- tempted much the same thing in both stylistic effect and theme. Rvera depicted the ruthless power of the rubber interests; Asturias is concerned with the ruthless totality of the state. Both use highly im- pressionistic poetic styles to convey the effects of these forces upon the human mind, e.g. the surrealistic use of nightmares and dreams. Both create a stiflying and intensely suffocating atmosphere. In the one, the rain forest closes in upon the mind in a nervous anthropomorphism. In the other, the total state and the city oppress and fill the mind with terror. Rivera's work has become a classic of its kind. Nevertheless, many of its weaknesses have been overcome in El Seiior Presi- dente. Rivera, just recovering from disease and a horrible experience in the jungle, recalls with vividness a terrifying mental trial which imparts an almost frantic and hysterical note to his writing. Asturias is the calmer and more serene writer. His style does not run to such excess, and therefore his results are not so nervous or erratic in their effect. One is able to sense his transcendence over the eery and un- canny imagery which he employs. Of course it must be noted that Asturias has a definite advantage in not binding the narrative of his material to the mind of a sick individual allowing him to alternate between a loose surrealism and more ob- jective treatment of his materials. Rivera also tended toward epic quality and ideal- istic overtones. His characters tend to be 683</page><page sequence="2">684 HISPANIA romantic and unconvincing. Asturias does not expend great effort on character devel- opment, but those figures that he does create are much less romantic. He is also able to integrate his various characters smoothly and to enhance his total effect more successfully through the same. Pelele, the idiot, is used in a fashion similar to Rivera's development of Arturo Cova. Haunted by fear, nightmares, a feverish state of mind, and insufficient intelligence to rationalize the world around him, the idiot's mind is exploited masterful- ly by Asturias' pen to impart grotesque life to the inanimate city and to create the atmosphere in which he unfolds his story. Arturo Cova serves some of the same pur- pose, but unfortunately throughout the entire book thus making it overly frenzied. The fact that Asturias transcends these devices is most clearly indicated by virtue of the fact that he embodies fundamental notions about surrealism within his own surrealist imagery. Prior to any substantial development of his story a key image passes through the feverish mind of the idiot. Y cantaba en el pino un pijaro que a la vez que pajaro era campanita de oro: -iSoy la Manzana-Rosa del Ave del Paralso, soy la vida, la mitad de mi cuerpo es mentira y la mitad es verdad; soy rosa y soy manzana, doy a todos un ojo de vidrio y un ojo de verdad: los que ven con mi ojo de vidrio ven porque suefian, los que ven con mi ojo de verdad ven porque miran! iSoy la vida, la Manzana-Rosa del Ave del Paraiso; soy la mentira de todas las cosas reales, la realidad de todas las ficciones!2 The dual aspect of the mind's activity, i.e. the conscious perception of reality and the inner world of dreams and unconscious activity, are further brought out in the mind of Cara de Angel. In his dreams we meet, "El Suefio, sefior que surca los mares oscuros de la realidad . . . esa capa de irrealidad que recubre de un polvo muy fino los hechos diarios de la vida."3 Asturias is clearly the master and not the protagonist of his profound excursions into inner realities. At times the symbolism and poetic forms are difficult. This is perhaps unavoidable in working with such tools. Upon abandon- ing rational language, which best dupli- cates observable reality, the author runs the risk of entering an area of such profound obscurity that it is accessible and meaning- ful only to himself. Such extremism bor- ders on a purely automatic form of writing which lacks creative control. Asturias skill- fully avoids this degenerate use of sur- realism by synthesizing two universes of forms; rational, discursive language, and a world of forms and imagery which reveal a deeper reality, one which is more deeply rooted in the world of the human psyche. It is the equilibrium of these two separate and distinct spheres of communication that prevents any prolonged stays in regions of great obscurity. Where it has been neces- sary to paint abysmal and unfathomable anguish he rises above the limited natural appearances of reality. Where it has been necessary to return to these appearances he employs only a minimum of transforma- tion through language. In the balance and integration of the two lies the success of his style. In a careful analysis one must take care to separate his poetry, which is only a device to heighten reality, and his sur- realism. Asturias often resorts to simple unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound. These instances are best appreciated and most easily dis- covered when we read him aloud. His very opening lines are excellent examples of these verbal euphonies: .. i Alumbra, lumbre de alumbre, Luzbel de piedralumbre! Como zumbido de oidos persistia el rumor de las campanas a la oraci6n, maldo- blestar de la luz en la sombra, de la sombra en la luz. iAlumbra, lumbre de alumbre, Luzbel de piedralumbre, sobre la podredumbre! iAlumbra, lumbre de alumbre, sobre la podredumbre, Luz- bel de piedralumbre! iAlumbra, alumbra, lumbre de alumbre . . . , alumbre ... , alumbra ... alumbra, lumbre de alumbre . . . , alumbra, alumbre . . .4 Beyond its esthetic merits the work is</page><page sequence="3">"EL SE1ROR PRESIDENTE" 685 purposive. Asturias is concerned with the age old issue of spirit and Caesar, which achieves new form and life beneath his skillful pen.5 New effectiveness is born from a more inclusive treatment of the realm of the spirit. The human aspiration and the existential need for liberty is pursued into fathomless and yawning recesses of the mind. At times the depth of anguish is reminscent of that greatest of all masters of psychological anguish Fyodor Dostoevsky. Any hope against the blood and tyranny of the regime must lie in man's determina- tion for self-realization. Cara de Angel, who more than any figure is deeply involved in the perpetration of evil, ultimately mani- fests this yearning for the realization of his essential self. First passing through tremendous inner throes of despair his spiritual self's revulsion against the invasion of its privacy triumphs. It is true that he is both physically and spiritually destroyed, but his defeat is a necessary one; for the author is running the whole gamut of the state's fearsome resources in its constant invasion of the realm of the spirit. While their elders turn to a fatalistic acceptance of the iron fist, youth still burns with the fire of rebellion. Even in the hopeless plight of an unending imprison- ment its words explode with a courage that brings tears to the eyes of one of the elder prisoners. The passive exhortation of a fellow prisoner falls on deaf ears. "i Qu es eso de rezar! iNo debemos rezar! iTra- temos de romper esa puerta y de ir a la revoluci6n!" 6 The acceptance of the violation of hu- man dignity and the privacy of the spirit leads utimately to one of two ends, religious stoicism or death. Neither are answers to the problem. Cara de Angel, too late in seeing the mistake of his participation in the regime and the acceptance of the same, dies miserably. His devoted wife Camila turns to a religious fatalism. Signi- ficantly she leaves the city to raise their son in the country where he grows up free from the polluted life of the city and his natural spirit of freedom is less fettered as it grows. Perhaps here with "el hombre del campo" it is that that hope and interest in justice necessary for the salvation of the land will remain. For surely man's greater enemy is not the state but the "paiblico que ve con indiferencia el bien y el mal." Surely those whose lives go on indifferent to those imprisoned and persecuted by the state are "iViles! iInmundos! iC6mplices de iniquidad!" For just as Cara de Angel sowed the seeds of his own destruction, they will destroy themselves. If these are truly "un pueblo maldito,"7 then they are the authors of their own ultimate dam- nation. NOTES 1 Perhaps the most fascinating account of the Estrada Cabera era is Ecce Pericles by Rafael Arevalo Martinez. The author has examined a prodigious number of newspapers, interviewed many of the hapless victims of the regime, and examined some dramatic personal diaries. 2 Asturias, Miguel Angel, El Sehior Presidente, Buenos Aires, 1959, pp. 26-27. 3 Ibid., 152-153. 4 Ibid., 9.
