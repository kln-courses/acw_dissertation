Bernstein's aim is to 'to do justice to the overall historical development of the Roman phenomenon of the ludi publici' (20) with special reference to the religious and political factors behind the rapid increase from their beginnings to the end of the Republic. The games' public character excludes consideration of munera (14-15), which received private sponsorship under the Republic. After an introduction surveying secondary literature, B. traces the games back to Etruscan times. They were linked to the dedication of temples, notably that of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the sixth century, and their essentially religious character is marked by a pompa to the place of worship. Greek influence led to the introduction of anthropomorphic images of gods thought to be</page><page sequence="2">II. THE REPUBLIC 225 literally present and enjoying the proceedings (cf. lectisternia). This conception was taken over by the Republic, with priestly privileges assigned to magistrates whose role as representatives of the community in its dealing with the gods created dual religious/political power exercised through ludi. During the mid-fourth to second centuries the games saw great expansion, as administrative duties and financial support were extended to the new elite. Crude drama was added to racing and athletic contests, and wealth pouring in from foreign conquests encouraged excess in scale. At the same time, Greek religious influence received further impetus, e.g., through introduction of ludi at the direction of Sibylline oracles. In all of this the ruling class exploited the prestige of Greek culture to define the new Roman society while cementing its own position by entertaining the public. In 237 B.C. Greek drama was added and Rome's connections with Troy were elaborated. Introduction of several more major games during the crises of the later 2oos reflect their practical value for morale. The heavy expenditure which helped shape public opinion at times of stress, however, also had an opposite, subversive effect when used as a tool by individuals for winning popular support, though exploitation of games never led to true secularization in the modern sense owing to their inherent religious dimension (288 f.). The ludi to Victory initiated by Sulla and Caesar focused heavily on the sponsors' exploits to take maximum advantage of the prestige games carried. Under the Empire public and private spheres were combined under the emperor and official games were further enriched by munera. By then 'ludi publici had long belonged to the arcana imperii' (353) an axiom which makes B.'s study also a most useful prehistory of public bloodshed in Roman society. The book has exhaustive bibliography in the notes and includes convenient summaries in each chapter. University of Wisconsin, Madison PAUL PLASS</page></plain_text>
