<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Uses of Aesthetic Theory Ellen Handler Spitz T o ask what relevance or value aesthetic theory has for the arts educator is to pose a fundamental question about the relation between philosophy and education. I would like to explore a limited aspect of this question, to argue that aesthetic theory can inform and enrich praxis in arts education, and to demonstrate this by example. I propose to take a specific theory, that of E. H. Gombrich as developed in Art and Illusion, and to demonstrate ways in which this theory might be translated into a program of aesthetic education in the visual arts for children. My purpose is not only to argue that theoretical work can stimulate and be transformed into educational action, but also to present a paradigmatic way of doing this, i.e., of using theory. My claim is that the approach offered here will be found applicable to other theoretical works, and that it will thus enable readers to vitalize their own teaching experiences with concepts and hypotheses drawn from a variety of theoretical writings and imaginatively worked into specific educational milieus. As is true of most theorists, Gom- brich, obviously, did not write with any overt pedagogical motive. Each person who teaches must, therefore, read the text sensitively and dis- cover what might be relevant, first for himself and his own growth, and, secondarily, for his students and the situation in which he and they are interacting. Art and Illusion attempts to answer questions about the history of representational styles in the visual arts (especially in the two-dimensional media of painting and graphics), about the complex nature of perception, about the creative process and mimesis ("making and matching"), and about the ambi- guities of imagery. In each of these broad areas Gombrich presents ideas that have challenged my way of thinking, and what I propose to do is to focus on several ideas that have particularly interested me and show how they might find their way into a teaching situation. To begin with, Gombrich places great stress upon the active nature of perception. He believes that there is no such thing as innocent or passive, purely sensory, retinal seeing. (1960, pp. 172, 305) He refers to Karl Popper's "searchlight theory" (p. 28) which describes man as constantly hypothesizing about his environment, searching for meaning, always involved in perceptual trial and error. We come, Gombrich says, to all visual experience with a "mental set" (p. 60) or schema, which includes certain habits of approach, certain classes or categories, in short, familiarity with a visual language that causes us to expect and anticipate. Gombrich's notion is that this "mental set," this "effort after meaning," results in our making one interpretation, one reading, that it blinds us initially to inherent am- biguity. (pp. 395, 396) Right away there seem to be all sorts of directions one could take with this material in a visual arts program for children. First, I would set a goal of increased self-awareness: I would hope the children might become more conscious of their "mental set," of what they themselves bring to every visual experience so that they would not immediately presume either that they see what is "really" there or that a painter depicts what is "really" there. How might I accomplish this? One way might be to present the children with some ambiguous images of the type Gombrich uses illustratively in his text. (pp. 5, 7, 103, 104, 105, 238, 239, 280, 307, etc.) These images (some diagrams; others, noted works of art) might include ones that involve many varieties of cryptogram, e.g., ambiguity with respect to shape, to size/distance, to line, and to color. Children could respond to these images in numerous ways: by partner- ing up and talking about alternative readings; by drawing ambiguous images of their own; by using objects and space in their classroom to explore the ambiguities of the third dimension-that is, by arranging objects of the same and different sizes and thereby creating various effects and illusions. Other exercises occur to mind: one could flash images on a screen rapidly and ask the children to respond to them spontaneously (verbally) so as to experience the speed with which the mind makes its hypotheses and how diverse these hypotheses can be with respect to a uniform stimulus. One might show children a blurred, out-of-focus slide of a painting, ask them to draw it, then gradually bring the slide into focus for them- so that they could experience their own discomfort in the absence of seemingly clear visual cues and their mind's tendency to fill the gap with some kind of guess or interpreta- tion which would change as the slide came into focus. Another experi- ment might be to ask the children, as Gombrich suggests, (p. 279) to measure each other's images in a mirror to discover the discrepancy between what they believe they see and what is Art Education May 1982 30</page><page sequence="2">"really" there. The ultimate goal of all these exercises would be to enable children to approach works of art (i.e., paintings) with a heightened sensitivity to their cryptographic nature, to dispel the tacit unexamined assumption of an "innocent eye," and to make children keenly aware of their own crucially important and highly individualized role in perceiving the painting. I would want them to understand what Gombrich means by the artist giving the beholder much to do and drawing him into the "magic circle of creation." (p. 202) Naturally, all kinds of refinements and excurses could be worked out, depending upon the nature of the paintings that the children would be seeing and upon the stage of develop- ment of the children, among other variables. An interesting philosophical question that might arise spon- taneously in some groups involved in this sort of work is whether the artist-who creates an illusion-is a species of sorcerer, magician, artificer, even liar. (This was, after all, Plato's concern.) It would be mar- velous to discuss this issue with children, so that they could begin to explore the idea of multiple realities. Gombrich speaks of the artist's need to re-classify: to become detached enough to discover an entirely new set of meanings (p. 306), e.g., to see in terms of negative shapes, or, as with Cezanne, in terms of cylinders, cones, and spheres. If children can learn to shift schema, perhaps they can learn pari passu to shed primitive ideas of truth and falsity with relation to visual patterns and the artist's products as well as their own. One highly cogent chapter of Art and Illusion is entitled "Pygmalion's Power." Here Gombrich deals with the primacy of "making over matching," (p. 116) i.e., the notion that before any artist ever wanted to "match the sights of the visible world, he wanted to create things in their own right." (pp. 70, 71) (It is interesting to note here the accord between Gombrich and Susanne Langer who, in Feeling and Form, 1953, asserts that "a comparative study of decorative art and primitive representational art suggests forcibly that form is first, and that the representational function accrues to it." (p. 70) She talks about the "adaptation of the old decorative devices to the systematic depiction of objects," (p. 71) and says that "no matter how many possibilities are opened to the artistic imagination by the power of representing things, imitation is never the main devise in organization." (p. 71) Gombrich would enthusiastically agree.) Two ideas emerge from this chapter which might profitably be transmitted to children. One has to do with the quasi-magical power we impute to the created image, and the other, with the understanding that imitation consists no less in learning and employing visual language transmitted from artist to artist than in "copying nature. " As Gombrich points out in this chapter, (p. 99) children are well-atuned to the first of these. They make houses out of cardboard boxes, trains out of chairs, hats out of bowls, even doll food out of puzzle pieces. Exercises in this area should be designed to reinforce and enhance this type of transformational activity. Children might, for example, create life-size paper characters with paint, fabric, yarn, and the like, give names to them, write monologues in the personae of these characters, invent dialogues between pairs of them, encourage these characters to "in- habit" the classroom along with themselves. One could foster all sorts of visual make-believe. Often three- dimensional media such as papier-mache and plaster that can be painted are excellent choices for this sort of fantasy work because the forms grow slowly, giving the children an opportunity to become attached to an object as it is brought to life, and also because of the way in which, as Susanne Langer says, sculpture expresses "biological feeling," (p. 89) creates the "semblance of a living form," (p. 89) gives us an "anthropomorphic fancy." (p. 92) As to the second idea, which Gom- brich develops from Malraux, that "art is born of art, not of nature," (p. 24) I can suggest several ways in which children might experiment with this. In one class, children might be given an object to draw from life. Afterwards, they could be given a picture, a drawing, or a series of drawings, their own, each other's, "I would hope the children might become more conscious of their 'mental set,' of what they themselves bring to every visual experience . .." I~ ~~-~ Art Education May 1982 31</page><page sequence="3">and master drawings, and asked to draw copies. Discussion and comparison of the resultant images might lead to some interesting insights. If the time period were long enough, children might keep journals or folders of their own drawings in chronological order (or even retrieve pictures made by themselves at an earlier stage of development) and analyze the modifi- cations that have gradually occurred. They could experiment with inventing artificial visual languages using line qualities, shapes, and color and try to hold "conversations" in terms of these non-verbal, visual languages. Children might try on their own to trace stylistic idiosyncrasies through time in the works of one artist or possibly even influences from one master to another throughout a certain historic period. Children could extend their discussion of the role of "copying," imitation, to other art forms-such as music and dance. Ultimately, I would wish children to feel comfortable enough to extrapo- late from the anecdote that Gombrich tells about Matisse at the end of "Pygmalion's Power." He recounts that when a lady visiting the artist's studio said, "But surely, the arm of this woman is much too long," the artist replied politely, "Madame, you are mistaken. This is not a woman. This is a picture." (p. 115) It would, of course, be possible, to write at greater length and to elaborate upon the ways in which Gombrich might be used in the teaching of children. But the purpose here is not to present a curriculum but, rather, to demonstrate by example how aesthetic theory can play a vital role in the educational process. I hope that some of the foregoing examples have been convincing. I am persuaded that it would be equally possible to have worked out examples with another theorist, such as Langer or Dewey or perhaps Santayana, for, as it seems to me, the philosophers of art have bequeathed to us a cache of ideas which we may draw upon to invigorate and strengthen our educational practice. In conclusion, I would like to quote from Rudolf Arnheim's introduction to the revised edition of Art and Visual Perception, 1974, as his words bear so directly on my message in the foregoing pages: (A) prejudice has it that verbal analysis paralyzes intuitive creation and com- prehension. Again there is a core of truth here. The history of the past and the experience of the present provide many examples of the destruction wrought by formulas and recipes. But are we to conclude that in the arts one power of the mind must be suspended so that another may function? Is it not true that disturbances occur precisely when any one mental faculty operates at the expense of another? The delicate balance of all a person's powers-which alone permits him to live fully and to work well-is upset not only when the intellect interferes with intuition, but equally when sensation dislodges reason- ing. Groping in vagueness is no more productive than blind adherence to rules. Unchecked self-analysis can be harm- ful, but so can the artificial primitivism of the person who refuses to understand how and why he works. Modern man can, and therefore must, live with unprece- dented self-consciousness. (p. 5) You probably know kids with a lot of art talent.
