<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rodney Stenning Edgecombe University of Cape Town, South Africa Ways of Personifying Over the centuries, rhetoricians and critics have offered numerous defi- nitions of personification, some inclusive, others restrictive. Since inclusive definitions tend to blur distinctions and restrictive ones to push aside prob- lematic instances in their pursuit of clarity, I shall use this essay to construct a typology of practices that have either been bundled roughly together or forced into the cold out of a failure to acknowledge their kinship with main- stream personification. This typology will be structured by the ways in which the device mediates between the divine and the ordinary, the typical and the specific. Quintiliano distinction between personification the trope and personifi- cation the figure, which separates a whole group of personifications better classified as metaphors, serves as a useful point from which to begin a tidy- ing exercise: "Effects of extraordinary sublimity are produced when the theme is exalted by bold and almost hazardous metaphor and inanimate objects are given life and action" (Sonnino 54). Because tropes differ from schemes in causing semantic disruption, tropic conformatio (personification) manifests itself in a derangement and blending of categories pivotal to metaphor: hence Quintiliano stress on the boldness and hazardousness of the enterprise. But while tropic personification transfers human properties to nonhuman objects, it does not, on the whole, create the complete mental image of a person. Because a metaphoric frame encloses the transference, the imagination focus- es only on the specified attributes. Tropic conformatio, in other words, has an inbuilt metonymy. Take the following lines from Paradise Lost : "Sky low'r'd, and muttering Thunder, some sad drops / Wept at completing of the mortal Sin" (401). At first glance we might construe the drops as tears and immedi- ately shift to the idea of an unlocalized cosmic grief. Because the lines are out of context, "Sky" registers as the subject and tears as the object of the sen- tence, but we nonetheless reject the mental image of a sky with eyes: the per- sonification cuts off when visual and other proprieties are about to be violat- ed. If, however, we relocate the lines in Milton's poem, a different reading becomes possible: Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, Sky low'r'd, and muttering Thunder, some sad drops Style : Volume 31, No. 1, Spring 1997 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Rodney Stenning Edgecombe Wept at completing of the mortal Sin Original; (401) Because no classical tradition exists for a god-sky (as opposed to a sky-god), the image of a sky personified (and eyed) is not easily entertained, and the mind automatically restricts the scope of the conformado. We could, howev- er, take "Nature" rather than "Sky" as the subject of "wept" and "Sky" as the object she lowers in grief before weeping at Adam's sin. Such a reading, which brings us closer to personification that projects a human figure in its entirety, could also claim the support of a well-established history of deifica- tion, as in Edmund's "Thou, Nature, art my goddess" ( King Lear 24). Even so, the idea remains problematic because in this instance the sheer scale of the personification defies the imagination. Milton has personified Earth in its cor- porate entirety, not as a figure made manageable by human incarnation: a woman whose very bowels are commensurate with the planet's mass ("trem- bl'd from her entrails"). And that image, of course, leads us into the province of the sublime, of entities finally inconceivable in their vastness. Steven Knapp, taking Kant's definition of the phenomenon as his starting point, has argued that "[i]f personification knows anything at all, it knows itself, with a symmetrical purity unmatched by anything in empirical consciousness" (4). Knapp here offers a subtle view of the topic, but I am worried by the claim that a personification knows only itself, the more so because to my mind the definition applies chiefly to what Knapp calls "the semipersonified metaphors that energize Johnson's prose" (6). If we follow Burke's more empirical approach to the sublime, we can find another explanation for the eagerness of eighteenth-century commenta- tors to endorse Quintilian's coupling of personification and the sublime. Richard Stack's Essay on the Sublimity of Writing (1787) claims that almost all passions, if carried to excess, naturally fall into the use of prospopoeia, one of the boldest figures of speech, and sublimest expressions of passion. In cases like these nothing seems attended to but the effects themselves. The imagination is too strongly impressed and too deeply interested to trace them to their causes. (qtd. in Wasserman 442) Stack seems, like me, to have sensed that personification has a self-limiting mechanism built into it - "nothing seems attended to but the effects them- selves" - but he does not suggest why this sort of métonymie framing should subsist within the trope. I would argue that it is the mental exhaustion accompanying our failure to imagine huge figures that opens an avenue into the sublime. Take the case of Homer's epithet rhododaktylos : even when there is a manageable icon at hand (the goddess Eos), the personification becomes problematic as soon as we try to think of an entire figure with fingers as large as the rays of the ris- ing sun. Sooner than weary our minds with discomfiting and impossible giant-</page><page sequence="3">Ways of Personifying 3 esses, we restrict the scope of the embodiment. Personifying metaphor thus invites the imagination to center on the point at which transference is made and at which the fusion occurs - shafts of pink light, shafts of pink flesh; it does not ask for further physiological (as opposed to physical) extrapolations. But even while we throw that métonymie frame around the image, we are half conscious of a spectral hugeness beyond it rather as we might sense the huge- ness of an allosaurus when we see a photograph of a single incisor. It would seem, then, that one province of the Burkian sublime - vastness - blends into another - indistinctness - by virtue of our inability to visualize such vastness and our natural inclination to settle for a vague, half-realized approximation of the image. Knapp quotes the way Coleridge, via Collier, had followed Burke in praising the suggestively indistinct personification of Death in Paradise Lost : The grandest efforts of poetry are where the imagination is called forth, not to pro- duce a distinct form, but a strong working of the mind, still offering what is still repelled, and again creating what is again rejected; the result being what the poet wishes to impress, namely, the substitution of a sublime feeling of the unimaginable for a mere image. (qtd. in Knapp 8) When Coleridge speaks of the mind's effort in this regard, he is setting up conditions for its eventual exhaustion. When it battles with data that defy encapsulation (because Milton has scumbled the perceptual grounds), the mind will be teased out of thought: The other shape, If shape it might be call'd that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb, Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, For each seem'd either; . . . (Milton 248) I would submit, though, that even when the terms of the personification are less equivocal, its sheer scale will issue in the same oscillating bafflement. Samuel Johnson maintains that even schematic (as opposed to tropic) personification has a self-regulating motor that cuts out when its objective has been achieved: Thus Fame tells a tale and Victory hovers over a general or perches on a standard; but Fame and Victory can do no more. To give them any real employment or ascribe to them any material agency is to make them allegorical no longer, but to shock the mind by ascribing effects to nonentity. (1:1 85) While Johnson implies that all personification has a stenographic quality - that it notâtes without developing - occasionally, as I hope to show later, it can be sustained and extended without "shocking] the mind." Personifying metaphor, on the other hand, builds in limits to the scope of its</page><page sequence="4">4 Rodney Stenning Edgecombe operations. The mind not only founders on the scale, it is also reined in by questions of plausibility and tact, as in these lines from Gray's "Bard": 'Hark, how each giant-oak and desert cave 'Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath! 'O'er thee, oh king! their hundred arms they wave, 'Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe; . . . (The Poems of Gray, Collins and Goldsmith 186) Here personifying metaphor invests the oaks with arms and voices, moving the reader's imagination directly to the botanical and acoustical analogues of each in turn: branches and rustling leaves. Once those analogues have been set in place, the process of connection stops. If Gray had persisted with the human figuration by giving the trees knotty eyes, twiggy noses, and fungoid ears, he would have moved his poem from the sublime to the fantastical-grotesque, the mode, for example, of Snow White's forest night- mare in the Walt Disney cartoon or of the Ent episode in The Lord of the Rings. Once the equation of human and tree produces dendriform people or animated trees, we have crossed from personification into anthropomorphism, a very different country even if the border remains in dispute. Indeed, the term anthropomorphism is something of a misnomer; it would be more accurate to call the phenomenon anthropopsychism, for it imposes not our form on non- human subjects but rather our whims and appetites. Aesop's dog walks on all fours, after all, and while the stork and fox might drink from human vessels, they do not wear the clothes a Greek Disney might have given them. I there- fore think that we should challenge Joseph Scaliger's claim that prosopopoeia results if "intelligence is assigned to the non-intelligent or to the half-intelli- gent such as animals" (qtd. in Sonnino 55). Having thus reassigned tropic conformado to the category of metaphor and ventriloquial "personification" to the genre of fable and apologue, I shall tidy the remaining material into two general categories: prosopopoeia effect- ed by incarnation on the one hand and by rarefaction on the other. The first of these presents a literary equivalent to deification, the channel by which numen is relayed to humanity; the second parallels euhemerism, the process by which humans rise to the stature of godhead. Deification might be said to embody a principle of descent; euhemerism one of rising. In the words of Quintilian, after all, schematic personification can "bring down the gods from heaven and raise the dead" (qtd. in Sonnino 54-55). According to R. H. Barrow, the Roman gods evolved from the "numinization" of everyday things: It was thought that to name its manifestation in individual phenomena gave defini- tion to what was vague, and, so to speak, piped the energy to the desired end. . . . Every minute operation of nature and man - the manifold life of the fields, the daily</page><page sequence="5">Ways of Personifying 5 tasks of the farmer, the daily round of his wife, the growth and care of their chil- dren - took place in the presence and by the energy of these vague powers, now becoming formless deities. (14-15) To deify was to channel vague potentiality into language, to turn numen into nomen. Shakespeare describes the process in Henry V, marking off the levels through which an abstraction passes on to godhead: And what have kings that privates have not too, Save ceremony, save general ceremony? And what art thou, thou idol ceremony? What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers? (102-03) This dramatizes the pleroma of personification, the principle by which a com- mon noun ("ceremony") is emptied of specific content and rendered abstract ("general ceremony") before earning the godly right of apostrophe as an abstraction enthroned ("idol ceremony"). Even though Henry belittles ceremony, he relies on a pattern of aug- mentation that could almost be viewed as the pendant of Falstaff 's kenosis , the principle of restriction underlying his dethronement of honor in J Henry IV: "What is honour? A word. What is in that word honour? Air" (145-46). Falstaff disincarnates the abstraction - it literally vanishes into thin air - in contrast to the Roman practice of simultaneously naming and embodying abstract ideas. Coleridge has some useful things to say in this regard: "Of a people who raised altars to fever, to sport, to fright, etc., it is impossible to determine how far they meant a personal power or a personification of a power" (30). When conformatio takes god-making as its paradigm, it moves by imperceptible points along the continuum between "personification of a power" and "personal power." The more developed the cult, and the greater the accretion of flesh-forming narrative, the more powerful the prosopopoeia will become. Because nomen crystallizes numen , it follows that all language must have at least some capacity to personalize abstractness. Its most banal form is "printer's devil" personification, that is, prosopopoeia that seems to hinge on the arbitrary selection of the upper case. This undeveloped mode of personifi- cation nonetheless has a certain diagrammatic value: if the visual dimension is all but suppressed, it resembles the sternly abstract versions of deity, for example, God conceived as a triangle as He is on the chapel reredos in Trinity College, Cambridge. Any kind of icon, any kind of embodiment will traduce the ineffable nature of godhead. The more full-bodied a personification, the less it stands in need of the inscriptions "Justitia" and "Humanitas" that Donald Davie has seen below the statues of public buildings (95) and the fur- ther it descends the ladder of abstraction. Patricia Meyer Spacks, for example, has called Collins's "Observance" a personification "devoid of pictorial real-</page><page sequence="6">6 Rodney Stenning Edgecombe ity" (145). And because it lacks an antecedent deification (unlike, say, "nature"), its personification will be self-enclosed rather than symbolic, like Empson's "self-inwoven" similes that compare something "to a vaguer or more abstract notion of itself' (190). Furthermore, since "Observance" is denied the embodiment that sustained apostrophe or physical attributes would give it, it resembles the tautological definition of deity ("I am who I am"), another version of deity as Euclidean form. In polytheistic religions, on the other hand, the accidents of incarna- tion - color, texture, and variety - are grafted onto this existential blankness and stain the white radiance of Eternity. The blankness of Collins's "Observance" in "The Manners. An Ode" and of Johnson's "Observation" in The Vanity of Human Wishes is a function of their having failed to idolize the abstraction, to give it the cult of attributes and prayers on which deific per- sonification relies. When personification is faceless, the abstract nouns can almost be converted into gerunds: that is, they are perceived as functions, not as figures. Because observation is himself the act of viewing, a line like Johnson's comes close to the tautology of "I am who I am" or, if not quite to that level, then to the relentless thrumming of traductio (where syntactic changes are rung on a single word): "Let Observation, with extensive view, / Survey mankind from China to Peru" (Peacock 3:232). A human activity has been platonized into the idea of itself. That this sort of hypostatic conformano is not peculiar to the eighteenth century can be gathered from its occurrence also in the verse of Shelley. In Alastor , for example, we learn that poesy is herself a poet, another instance of "gerundival" personification in which an action has been nominalized into an identity: "Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, / Herself a poet" (Peacock 4:358). Like Yahweh, she is who she is. But in the same poem Shelley also lays bare a different personifying mechanism, that by which Death embodies itself not by dying but by a paradoxical assumption of flesh: "No proud exemption in the blighting curse / He bears, over the world wan- ders for ever, / Lone as incarnate death" (Peacock 4:374). In Keats, indeed, the incarnation of Death is no less the subject of personifying ritual - invocation and petition - than is the most statuesque deity in Collins or Gray: "I have been half in love with easeful Death, / Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, / To take into the air my quiet breath" (Keats 208). Incarnation involves the assumption not only of a human form, but also of a personality. No longer merely subsisting but acting as well, it becomes the subject of a history - the legends attached to the deity - in which the votaries can detect precedents and parallels for their own circumstances. So, whereas in existential prosopopoeia the action remains self-reflexive and self-illustrating, in deific conformado it becomes autonomous and, for that reason, unpredictable. It is significant that in some odes by Collins and Shelley the personification generates awe and even terror. These emotions have thus to be managed by an apotropaic listing of its actions and character-</page><page sequence="7">Ways of Personifying 7 istics, a far cry from the docile "Observation" of Dr. Johnson's poem, which responds without resistance to his fiat: " Let Observation, with extensive view." Compare Collins's Fear: Ah Fear! Ah frantic Fear! I see, I see thee near. I know thy hurried step, thy haggard eye! Like thee I start, like thee disordered fly. ( The Poems of Gray, Collins and Goldsmith 418) Fear has become Fear not by fearing but by acquiring godlike attributes, for, as Jean Hagstrum has noted, to "justify the attitude of prayer the central and the attendant figures must seem iconically real enough to produce at least a genuflection" (275). Those "attendant figures," each a subpersonification within the embracing conformado , go a long way toward characterizing Fear. This fertility indexes the thoroughness with which the incarnation has been effected since it implies that the personification has its own creative power, that most important quality of godhead. Such creativity is best exem- plified by the fecund incarnations of Sin and Death in Paradise Lost : "And in embraces forcible and foul / Ingend'ring with me, of that rape begot / These yelling Monsters that with ceaseless cry / Surround me . . ." (251). Richard Abrams has also noted how in 2 Henry IV , "Rumor as mythmaker creates the personification Time, whose verbal presence in the play is therefore a symp- tom of Rumor's rule" (470-71). The flesh acquired in incarnation does not compromise the power of the being, but rather confirms it. Thus Collins's Fear leads a cortege of attendant personifications that have been extrapolated from its own emotional matrix (as from the womb of Milton's Sin). Collins has also theologized Fear by relating historical activities of the deity to the petition at hand. This recalls the form of the Anglican collect where, at Ascensiontide, for example, the feast ("we do believe thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into the heavens") is matched by the congregation's resolve: "so may we also in heart and mind thither ascend" {Book of Common Prayer 139). The deity has an independent life and purpose, and the votaries spotlight the aspects of that life capable of being imitated. This narrative or historical component is obviously important to our sense of personification as an animate being rather than an ad hoc formula- tion. Gods are always the subjects of legends. Wasserman has shown how Addison "associated the personification of abstractions with the 'fairy way of writing,' which gives life to characters that have no existence but what the poet bestows upon them, such as fairies, witches, and abstractions 'under a visible shape'" (443). But that is to portmanteau two distinct provinces of the imagi- nation: fairies and witches exist in the collective consciousness, and the abstractions "under visible shape" parasitize that existence - borrow their "godhead." The whole process of deific conformatio accordingly centers on a shift from indefinite mental "shapes" to concrete beings, arbitrary and</page><page sequence="8">8 Rodney Stenning Edgecombe autonomous, that have been conjured up by a willing suspension of disbelief. (Unlike the impossible giants and giantesses of tropic personification, fairies and, before them, the gods of Olympus have always been conceived on a scale that the imagination can encompass without strain.) And yet, by the very fact of their incarnation, they give us access to the sublime abstractions of "form" and "tendency" Gods are made more potent and ultimately more godly when numen is concretized and thus made worshipable. Indeed, some of the most successful deific conformado , far from tag- ging its subject in the manner of Davie's helpful sculptor (95), will sometimes register the environmental impact of a personification, implying properties and powers rather than stating them. Wasserman, contrasting the prosopopoeia of Blake's "Divine Image" and John Ogilvie's Evening, remarks that "the significant difference lies not in the greater or lesser degree of per- sonification, but in the presuppositions on which the two poets build their fig- ures; in the fact that Blake was an idealist, and Ogilvie an empiricist" (436). Converted into theological language, the distinction turns on the difference between a religion of pure transcendence (Deism, say) and one of embodi- ment and immanence. Because incarnation, to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot, involves the intersection of time and eternity, we might expect it to have an "environmental" impact. Gods have greater or lesser spheres of influence and will concenter those spheres upon their own special functions. The imag- inative effort behind the prosopopoeia of Gray's "Adversity" extends far beyond the mere positing of an abstract noun; instead, she reconfigures the mental landscape around her. To make a personification more real by tracing its effect on a context is partly to "novelize" the scheme, investing it with a continued rather than a nonce existence, translating it out of the blank space of notional acceptance into a tangible milieu. The whole process is run backwards, however, when we interpret a real- istic novel, as Bertrand Bronson has brilliantly pointed out: When we speak of this or that figure in a naturalistic novel or play as a "typical" character, we ourselves, instinctively turning allegorists or personifiers, reduce these figures to embodiments of one or two predominant traits or qualities; so that, as they pass current from mind to mind, they have no more three-dimensional actuality than what attaches to a personified abstraction - which is exactly what they have become: eponymous personified abstractions. (168) This describes what happens with the trope of pronominado or antonomasia , which also involves the interchange of moral generalities and specific persons. In Quintilian's definition, pronominado "substitutes something else for a proper name" (qtd. in Sonnino 149); it therefore stylizes an interpretive trans- action central to our reading of narrative and indeed of history itself. In his first version of the "Elegy," "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church- Yard," Gray connected the faceless individuals of Stoke Poges with various classical ana- logues: Cato, Cicero, and Caesar (Johnston 36-37). In the final version, he</page><page sequence="9">Ways of Personifying 9 substituted native for classical pronominatio and universalized the original subjects in a less emphatic way: Some village-Hampden that with dauntless breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood; Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood. ( The Poems of Gray, Collins and Goldsmith 128-29) In both instances, but more strikingly in the first, Gray has invested the local with the universal, rarefying complex personalities into tutelary functions. Cato and Cicero and Caesar have been essentialized as cultural "gods" and then potentially reincarnated as any other human whose essence approximates their own. Since that reincarnation remains a potentiality - Gray has written the stanza in the subjunctive mode - we are dealing here with personification that rarefies the flesh instead of materializing it; in other words, we have the apotheosis of human beings, not the incarnation of abstractions. The name for this transformation is euhemerism. Euhemerus, a Greek novelist of the fourth century B.C., wrote a novel entitled Sacred Scripture , which, according to The Oxford Classical Dictionary , allows for three different interpretations: it may be read "as sup- porting the traditional belief in Greek epic and lyric poetry which drew no clear distinction between gods and great men; as advancing a justification for contemporary ruler-cults; or as a work of rationalizing atheism" (415). Euhemeristic personification likewise blurs the distinction between gods and great men, drawing an abstraction from its antecedent embodiment. In deific personification, the space surrounding the abstraction is more usually notion- al than concrete, the nonspace or mental landscape of the psychomachia. Occasionally, however, as in the examples from Gray and Keble cited above, the personification is so thoroughgoing and sustained that it begins to influ- , enee its surroundings. Putting that process into reverse, we can cite instances in literature where concrete individuals have so fully absorbed the signifi- cance of their surroundings, rather in the manner of genii loci , that they can be said to represent or typify them. Much erotic poetry exhibits a tendency to deify the beloved, whether in the Petrarchan tradition or in that of the much earlier Arab poetry of Abbas Ibn Al-Ahnaf (750-809). Erotic compliment sees the beloved as a summation of loveliness; like Johnson's "Observation," she becomes Beauty by virtue of being beautiful: She is formed complete And beauty is complete In her face; beauty Which lies not in her face Lacks beauty's total. ( Birds Through a Ceiling of Alabaster 37)</page><page sequence="10">10 Rodney Stenning Edgecombe Pastoral hyperbole rings a change on this procedure, for here the deified beloved affects the landscape with her godly power. Both Marvell's Maria Fairfax ("'Tis She that to these Gardens gave / That wondrous Beauty which they have" [1 :84]) and Pope's Rosalinda ("Where-e'er you tread, the blushing Flow'rs shall rise" [131]), for instance, are not being personified so much as magnified. The poet's hyperbole turns each into a vegetation goddess, the focal point of the landscape upon which all its energies converge. To that extent, she moves from being a mere Petrarchan goddess to a tutelary genius rooted in a locale. This artificial, complimentary trope leads in turn to an adaptation more subtle still, one in which the effort of apotheosis is concealed instead of being displayed. And from this spring various di absconditi. Hagstrum has remarked how "[pļictorialist poets breed pictorialist readers" (267), referring to the contemporary critic who read a personification (the Genius of Agriculture) into a passage by Thomson in which no genius is men- tioned. Using biblical figures in a similar way, Keble displaces specific peo- ple with the abstract qualities they embody. He x-rays a text to trace anagog- ical bones that support it. Thus do Mary and Martha become Contemplation and Zeal in "Advent Sunday," and the Virgin and St. Joseph convert to Chastity and Reverence in "The Epiphany": There, swath'd in humblest poverty, On Chastity's meek lap enshrin'd, With breathless Reverence standing by, When we our Sovereign Master find. . . . (33) Because we are familiar with the narrative contexts onto which the prosopopoeia has been grafted, however, the effect is less subtle than in these lines from Gray's "Ode on the Spring": Still is the toiling hand of Care; The panting herds repose. Yet hark, how through the peopled air The busy murmur glows! The insect youth are on the wing, Eager to taste the honeyed spring, And float amid the liquid noon. ... (51) Care might at first glance seem to be another of Davie's "stately and big- breasted" statues of Justitia and Humanitas (95), but the riddling context works against the more facile, ad hoc fiats of incarnational prosopopeia. The poem has placed us in a concrete landscape: we know that it is twelve o'clock and we know that the herds are panting. Why, therefore, should Care's "toil- ing hand" be still? The answer is that a ploughman is taking his lunch and has conveniently offered himself up for abstraction, drawn out of the setting, not inserted into it. Dickens also detects his personifications on many occasions, as, for</page><page sequence="11">Ways of Personifying 1 1 example, on this in Little Dorrit, where the abstraction "Mendicity" finds multiple embodiment in a group of beggarly messengers: "Mendicity on com- mission stooped in their high shoulders, shambled in their unsteady legs, but- toned and pinned and darned and dragged their clothes, frayed their button-holes, leaked out their figures in dirty little ends of tape, and issued from their mouths in alcoholic breathings" (131). No hint of Roman stolas or togas in this sculptural group; the Marshalsea will not permit it, and the scheme has been all but camouflaged by the context in which it is native and endued. Keats's Autumn is demigodly to the extent that she can bilócate (a phe- nomenon recorded, apparently, of some Roman Catholic saints) and manifest herself with magical elisions in a range of harvest activities. John Creaser 's comments are especially illuminating in this regard: "The series of manifesta- tions in the second stanza not only hints at Christian revelation but also bears slight suggestions of the corn-goddess Ceres" (201). That is to say that Autumn has been euhemerized out of autumn tasks, a procedure marked, as in the examples cited above from Thomson, Gray, and Dickens, by a disregard for the traditional iconography of prosopopoeia; as Creaser points out, Keats includes none of the traditional props - ox, torch, and hoe - associated with Ceres. In tropic conformado , the sense faints in a Shelleyan way largely because it is overtaxed by effort of picturing, by the scale of the conception. Such is the sublime pole in the continuum of prosopopoeia; its beautiful pole (if we keep to the classification of Burke) is euhemeristic personification. Here the data are distinct and tangible, and the sense has simply to draw forth the divinity latent in ordinary things. Works Cited Abrams, Richard.
