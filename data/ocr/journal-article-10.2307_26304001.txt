<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 171 The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma The things which I have seen I now can see no more.. .Whither is it fled the visionary gleam? Where is it now, the glory and the dream? —William Wordsworth After 90 years, Sigmund Freud's dream of July 23rd-24th, 1895 continues in its distinction as having "received the greatest study in the psychoanalytic literature" (Grinstein, 1968, p.22), perhaps throughout all history, and certainly one that marks the birth of a continuing epoch by its founder: Do you suppose that some day a marble tablet will be placed on the house, inscribed with these words?—'In This House, on July 24th, 1895 the Secret of Dreams was Revealed to Dr. Sigm. Freud' (Freud, 1887-1904, p. 417). In the first 60 years since the dream, its interpretation en chanted readers on its own merit without any attempts to approach those areas which Freud left uninterpreted. In the last 30 years, however, several have questioned many of the theoretical issues of Freud's dream theory via the Irma dream, almost as if the "specimen dream" itself were the fulcrum on which Freudian dream theory rests, rather than a demonstration of a method. Freud's treatment of the Irma dream, however, was intended to demonstrate the major thesis that dreams are the fulfillment of a wish, while other inter-connecting facets of the theory were illustrated elsewhere in The Interpretation of Dreams. Those who review the dream continue to "spend much more time over it, derive further information from it (Schur, 1966; Hartman, 1983; Erikson, 1954; Elms, 1980; American Imago, Fall 1986, Vol.43, No.3, pp. 171-190.

The dreamer was a 39 year old neurologist with gar gantuan worries: retaining professional credibility after publishing a highly unpopular explanation of hysteria {Studies in Hysteria)-, the beginning strains in his relationship with his esteemed mentor, Joseph Breuer; the unsatisfac tory outcome of his recalcitrant patient, Emma; the death of a close patient and friend from cocaine injections who had, perhaps unwisely, trusted him; an usually deep recent de pression; excessive health concerns, due in part to a slow recovery from a life threatening cardiac episode; financial difficulties posed by his family of five children; Martha's pregnancy with a sixth child; possible frustration from sex ual abstinence; and thoughts that his treatment of even his more favored patients, such as "Irma," was being met with the satirical scepticism of his colleagues and friends. It was with these concerns that Freud wrote out the case history of Irma, demonstrating probity in his treatment of this favo rite patient (Jones, 1953) with intentions of giving it to the paternal Breuer. It was that night that he dreamt the frequently ana lyzed dream. It is again supplied for the reader, using Ma honey's (1978) more accurate translation in the present tense: A large hall—many guests, whom we receive.—Among them Irma, whom I immediately take aside, as if to answer her letter, and to reproach her that she doesn't accept the 'solution' yet. I say to her: 'If you still have pains, it is really your own fault.'—She answers: 'If you knew what pains I have now in my throat, stomach and abdomen, it's tightening me up.'—I am startled and look at her. She looks pallid and puffy; I think after all I am overlooking something organic. I take her to the</page><page sequence="3">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 173 window and look into her throat. With that she shows some resistance, like women who wear a denture. I think to myself, she doesn't need to do that.—Her mouth opens properly, and I find on the right a large white spot, and elsewhere I see remarkable curled structures which evidently are patterned on the nasal turbinai bones, extensive white-grey scabs.—I quickly call Dr. M. who repeats and confirms the examina tion. . .Dr. M. looks entirely different from usual; he is very pallid, limps, is beardless on the chin.. .My friend Otto now also stands next to her, and my friend Leop old percusses her over the bodice and says: 'She has a dullness below on the left,' points to an infiltrated por tion of the skin on the left shoulder (which I, in spite of the dress, just as he, feel).. .M. says: "Without a doubt, it's an infection, but it doesn't matter; dysentery will follow and the poison will be eliminated.. .We also di rectly know where the infection comes from. Recently my friend Otto, when she was not feeling well, gave her an injection of a preparation of proply, propyls... propionic acid.. .trimethylamin (whose formula I see in heavy type before me).. .one doesn't give such injec tions so lightly.. .Probably, too, the syringe wasn't clean (pp. 85-86). In spite of the plethoric attention to the dream's perti nent day residues and manifest content, there has been little attempt to relate the dream to the events known about Freud's childhood. Further, the knowledge of his mood at the time of the dream has not yielded any significant clues between the dream, his life at the time of the dream, and the pregenital events which shaped both. Freud's dream has, for the most part, received all but a Freudian treatment. He interpreted the dream by demon strating a connection between his associations and the mani fest content, both woven into the fulfillment of a previously unconscious wish. However, the latent thoughts from child hood were excluded from his interpretation of the dream. While to attempt a latent interpretive approach is perhaps more speculative, it is always more of a risk to mine the</page><page sequence="4">174 Timothy Anderson furthest buried instigators of the dream than tending the readily available topsoil of recent experiences and other manifest concerns. Though it would be a mistake to assume that attention to the surface meanings of the dream is of little significance or superficial, it is equally important to, "be at home.. .in the descending shafts" (Erikson, 1954, p. 139). In spite of all the attention that it has drawn, others who have re-analyzed the dream have largely neglected the possible childhood experiences and fantasies which may have contributed to the disguised latent thoughts. A few childhood connections to the Irma dream are made by Erik son (1954), but these are mostly in the service of further delineating the psychosocial ambience of the dreamer in relation to the manifest dream. For example, he speculated that the old religious nurse restored an important sense of trust in the young Freud after a difficult childhood period. Erikson compares this to the trying days of 1895 when, once again, Freud found himself troubled by his own plight. While her importance to the dream is mentioned, her role as the dream's instigator is given minimal priority. Swan (1974) attempts to demonstrate that the nurse did not serve the trust enhancing role suggested by Erikson, but quite to the contrary, represented a second "bad" mother. He further speculates of a possible early splitting of "good" and "bad" mothers with Freud, that this "bad" mother was displaced onto his father after her removal. Yet, it is not clear how this nurse is connected to a libidinal wish, as these remnants from childhood often are. Instead, he relates her and the dream to a class conflict. Freud's childhood remem brance of his father's admonishment: "That boy will never amount to anything" (Freud, 1900, p. 274) was disclosed by Erikson to be similar to his demeaning displacement of Otto in the dream as "a dirty little squirt" (Erikson, 1954, p. 160). Leavitt (1956) used the Fleiss letters to suggest that the dream allowed Freud to express his hostility toward Fliess via the character Otto without bringing these doubts to con sciousness because of the personal importance that Fliess was to Freud at the time. Schur (1966) interpretatively fol lows this view, including the communication between Freud</page><page sequence="5">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 175 and Fliess concerning the predicaments caused by the nearly fatal post-operative period of Emma Eckstein in his unveiling of the day residues of the Irma dream. He sug gests that the dream exculpates Fliess and shows how Freud needed Fliess at the time of the dream because of the devel oping of a positive "transference" with him, noting: "it (the letters) reads like a record of an analytic session" (Schur, 1966, p. 68). He discusses at length the notion that a rela tionship resembling a transference did exist, suggesting that its apex was reached when Freud wrote to Fliess (April 20, 1895) that a reproach would contradict his feelings. While Schur takes special note of this word in relation to the trans ference because it "is mainly an expression of 'feelings' and not logical thinking" (p. 67), he does not delineate at all on these "feelings" in the months preceeding the dream, and how this relates to the hidden reproach towards Fliess. Hartman (1983) convincingly shows that Emma and Irma were not the same patients and questions whether these specific day residues could contribute to the meaning of the dream in light of Schur's assumption that they were the same patient. Even though Emma and Irma were not the same person, the reaction that Freud has over Emma and how it significantly affects his relationship with Fliess obviously must be a clue to the dream's meaning. Further, remnants of this episode worked their way directly into the dream's content—particularly the nasal turbinai bones. Such evidence would only slightly impugn the significance of those who have relied on the Emma incident as their source of interpretation. Schur (1966) unknowingly, yet in sightfully, noticed the marked similarity between the "day residue" of the Emma incident and the manifest content of the Irma dream. Perhaps, it would facilitate the process of interpreting the dream's "deeper" layers to notice the paral lel between this and other events which preceded the dream, rather than prematurely discounting such insights on the basis that they were made using a false, yet perhaps an insignificant, premise. More importantly, Hartman (1983) notes that Freud's father fell terminally ill during the very month of the dream, arguing that linking the dream to early infantile</page><page sequence="6">176 Timothy Anderson sexuality is more likely to yield the uninterpreted meaning of the dream—much like Freud's own tenet: The deeper one carries the analysis of a dream, the more often one comes upon the track of experiences in childhood which have played a part among the sources of that dream's latent content (1900, p. 198). Traditionally such dream analysis has drawn from the free associations, the manifest content itself, the dynamics of the transference relationship between the analyst and the analysand, and the "day residues," which may include re cent events, thoughts, and affects which often are remarka bly similar in some significant way to childhood experi ences. Much of the previous work on the Irma dream has provided valuable material which, when simply applied to the known early childhood memories from Freud's life, will reveal fresh insights into the many and various latent path ways within the Irma dream. A combined knowledge of these roads to the unconsci ous will properly bring back these lost experiences, while utilizing only one such approach (i.e., just the manifest con tent) will make the journey to our lost city more laborious, perhaps impossible. The Mood of the Dreamer on July 24, 1895 As noted, the "transference" relationship between Freud and Fliess was in its developing stages. Yet, Schur (1966) does not relate these "feelings" to Freud's general affective state. When including his mood and how it is re lated to Fliess (particularly when their next meeting would be), there develops a pattern which can be better under stood using Freud's (1917) theory of depression. Blum (1979) has examined Freud's earliest memories and concen trates on the pre-oedipal separation-individuation themes, the fear of losing the object and the loss of that object's love. Using the depressed position, however, is not to imply that this mood was pathological in character; only that the trying period in which the dream was dreamt was at least one which tests the most peripheral boundaries of normalcy.</page><page sequence="7">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 177 In the months preceeding the Irma dream it appears that Freud was depressed. This was especially so during the trying post-operative period of Emma Eckstein. As Schur (1966) significantly demonstrates, Freud conceals any re proach toward Fliess, continually reassuring him of his de votion. Indeed, one might speculate that this depression is related to repressed anger toward Fliess over the opera tion's lack of success. The depression continues to the date of the Irma dream, but is particularly intense during March and April, 1895 when Emma's hemorrhaging reached its most life threatening point. It has been a dreadful period for me, in almost every respect... I rarely have felt so low and down, almost melancholic; all my interests have lost their meaning. The letdown after our long time together also must have contributed (March 13, 1895—Freud, 1887-1904, p. 119). Freud himself attributes his depression to the separation from Fliess. When they were recently together, times were better, and it is with this loss that Freud has noticed a dete rioration in his mood. This depression deepens as the length of their separation grows: How have I been? In a word, like a dog—infamously miserable. Since yesterday evening it has abated; I am again a human being with human feelings; I have an inkling of new ideas and of a few more years of life. It has not been this bad in a long time (March 15). . . Gloomy times, unbelievably gloomy (April 11, 1895— Freud, 1887-1904, pp. 120-123). After this, Freud begins to mention the possibility of visiting Fliess again, with several explanations about why he can't come. In the first letter, mention is made of visiting Fliess again: "Today I can write because I have more hope" (April 20, 1895—Freud, 1887-1904, p. 126). Six days later, Freud responds more optimistically to Fliess' invitation, say ing that he will come when he can, rather than a simple refusal, and in the following letter (written incidently on the</page><page sequence="8">178 Timothy Anderson very next day—April 27, 1895) Freud definitely reports without any qualifications: "I shall come and let you help me" (Freud, 1887-1904, p. 127). During this progressive lifting of Freud's "resistance," there is also a marked transi tion in mood to feeling very well. In the next letter (approxi mately a month later), Freud clearly misses Fliess: "Your letter gave me much pleasure and caused me to regret anew what I feel is the great gap in my life—that I cannot reach you in any other way" (May 25, 1895—Freud, 1887-1904, p. 128). While Freud had once responded without encour agement about the trip, the transition is apparent in the unambiguous anticipation contained in the following letter: "When should I come?" (June 12, 1895—Freud, 1887— 1904, p. 131). In the month before the dream, Freud's wish to be with Fliess grows with increasing intensity: perhaps a reenact ment of an earlier anticipation from childhood; perhaps one which is recapitulated in the Irma dream with even more clarity: So I shall come early in September. How shall I manage to do without you afterward, I do not know. I am hav ing enough troubles with smoking. Of course I still ex pect to hear a great deal from you before then (June 22, 1895—Freud, 1887-1904, p. 133). This intensified wish becomes what appears to be nearly despair, significantly, on the very day of the dream of Irma's injection: Daimonie (Demon), why don't you write? How are you? Don't you care at all anymore about what I am doing? What is happening to the nose, menstruation, labor pains, neuroses, your dear wife, and the budding little one? True, this year I am ill and must come to you; what will happen if by chance both of us remain healthy for a whole year? Are we friends only in mis fortune? Or do we also want to share the experiences of calm times with each other? Where will you spend the month of August? We are living very contentedly in Himmel (July 24, 1895—Freud, 1887-1904, p. 134).</page><page sequence="9">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 179 This letter is the only letter in all of the previous letters to Wilhelm Fliess which does not open with a greeting. He does begin with "demon" but this is not part of any official greeting and sharply contrasts with the warm greetings of earlier letters. There can be little doubt that these changes in Freud's mood in the months preceeding the dream, which coincide with an increasing "dependence" on Fliess, are not only reflected in the dream, but are important clues to the childhood conflicts which are safely encrusted in the latent thoughts. Problems with smoking in the absence of Fliess shortly before the dream indicate a particularly exacerbated oral dependence. In the six months prior to the Irma dream, Freud does not mention his smoking and it is only men tioned with the lifting of his depression and with increased wishes of visiting Fliess. Freud's theory of depression (1917) may help explain why he felt "unbelievably gloomy" in the months preceding the dream. The quasi-desperate letter to Fliess written on the very day of the dream, the direct reproach within the manifest content towards the recalcitrant Irma, the hidden reproach that Freud interpreted against his colleagues as the fulfillment of a wish in the latent dream, may all con tribute to an additional wish that hitherto has remained undeciphered. Freud accepted much of the blame for the Emma incident, refusing to acknowledge Fliess' responsibil ity (Schur 1966), and seemingly failed to perceive the wors ening of their relationship at this early stage due to repressed hostilities (Leavitt, 1956). In speaking of this period, Blum (1979) notes: Doubtless, the most important relationship at that pe riod of Freud's life which is not delineated in his 1897 comments or in the analytic literature on his letters or dreams is the (rapproachement) relationship with his mother (p. 150). The Irma dream may represent the search for this lost and loved object from childhood, as it is found in a traumatic event from his youth, manifested in the yearning from that day—the previously mentioned difficulties Freud faced at</page><page sequence="10">180 Timothy Anderson the time of the dream—a "lost" communication with Fliess— the search for the mysteriously concealed "solution"... The Screen Memory of the Empty Cupboard One of the more outstanding memories from Freud's childhood is of missing his mother and suspecting that she was locked in a cupboard. The less than three year old Sigmund was crying in despair when he had asked his step brother to unlock the cupboard. When it was finally op ened, the young child cried even more, until his mother entered looking particularly slender and beautiful (Freud, 1901). In recalling the incident Freud remembered that his nurse—the same nurse briefly discussed by Erikson (1954) in his interpretation of the Irma dream—had been taken from his life because she was a thief. In the analysis of his memory two years after the Irma dream, while in the midst of self-analysis, Freud considered that he had obviously blamed his brother Phillip for her being locked up. Thus, there is a direct connection between these two incidents and every reason to believe that the shock at the loss of his mother during the cupboard incident was greatly exacer bated by the actual loss of a mother substitute: his nurse. The impact of this memory has been underestimated in the interpretation of Freud's life, his dreams—especially the Irma dream—and the theory of psychoanalysis. Freud him self was well aware of the magnitude of this precursor to the cupboard event while in the midst of self-analysis: I can only indicate that the old man plays no active part in my case, but that no doubt I drew an inference by analogy from myself onto him; that in my case the "prime originator" was an ugly, elderly, but clever woman [the nurse], who told me a great deal about God Almighty and hell and who instilled in me a high opin ion of my own capacities (Freud, 1887-1904, p. 268). Only Erikson (1954) has recognized the ego-enhancing nature of the nurse in Freud's development and its later effect on the Irma dream; but he did not comment on</page><page sequence="11">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 181 how the dream reflects the trauma of her loss and the cupboard incident. Also mentioned above was Swan's (1974) opposite treatment of the nurse as a "bad" mother, without any integration of the dream's interpretation and the nurse's disappearance. Mahoney (1977) noted that Freud inaccurately called her his wet nurse or Amme, and further reveals that this appears within the German word zusammen (together), which is in the dream's manifest content. Within the word zusammen is the German word for sperm, Same, and Maho ney interprets that the dream allows Freud not only to manifestly be in the proximity of Irma, but also the more infantile wish of being in spermatic contact with Amme, the nurse. However, the mechanisms of dream disguise allow for several meanings to be concealed within one dream element. The last syllable of Amme ('ama) is phonetically similar to what many English speaking children call their mothers: 'ma'. When Amme's syllables are split and the first syllable is pro nounced in reverse, the word becomes an English 'ma-ma'. Freud was well versed in English and its literature, and it is very probable that he would have been aware of this En glish expression for mother. He avidly read the contempo rary English authors of his time including the mammoth sized Victorian novels such as David Copperfield, Middlemarch, and Bleak House (Jones, 1953). Further, Freud was quite aware of the various unconscious meanings in the mixture of English words in his Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1901), and the significance of English word play in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious (1905). Freud was interested in how languages mysteriously mix in some cases of hysteria. In par ticular, he greatly admired Breuer's case of Anna O.—pub lished in the very year of the Irma dream—in which her physical symptoms receded when she began unconsciously to speak English for several months, while still understanding those around her who spoke German. Freud's Amme was foreign to him in many ways. She was Czechoslovakian and a Catholic living in a German-Jewish home. Thus, the name Amme as "ma-ma" is backwards, since the first half of the word must be pronounced in reverse to</page><page sequence="12">182 Timothy Anderson make "ma-ma." Perhaps the splitting between "good" and "bad" mothers that Swan (1974) speaks of is represented in this split-mirroring of "ma's" in Amme, the first object of Freud's childhood desire. Thus, the trauma from the disap pearance of this once highly esteemed religious old woman (Freud also spoke of how he would preach before his family when coming home from church with her) may have been further irritated by the realization that she—the object which also may have enhanced the developing ego ideal with the precocious young child—was nothing more than a lowly thief. Additional evidence comes in the similarity of the first name of Freud's mother which was AmaXit. It not only con tains the "ma" concealed in Amme but, as Grigg (1972) noted in discussing the importance of the nurse in several of Freud's dreams (although omitting the Irma dream), within the first two syllables, there is a remarkable phonetic similarity to Amme! This yearned for object of the cupboard is additionally concealed in name to the earlier loss of his nurse. When these factors are considered, it is not so sur prising that Freud erroneously referred to his nurse as an Amme, for she truly was the replacement for Amalie. The "ma" in Amme appears in both female characters of the Irma dream as well as in those who are significantly associated to it. Initially, the dreamer is standing with his pregnant wife, "Ma"rtha (the r is not heard so prominently in the German pronunciation). Then the dream moves quickly to Freud's patient whom he renamed Ir"ma". Yet, as has been noted by others (Schur, 1966; Leavitt, 1956), much of the dream's manifest concerns are related to Freud's patient Em "ma". "Ma" is also present in the name "Ma'thilda, which threads its way through his associations (the name of his first child and of an old woman patient whom he frequently gave morphine injections). Freud re ferred to both his childhood nurse and the aged Mathilda simply as "old woman." Their connection has been deline ated at length by Swan (1974) and will be discussed later. Perhaps this raises the question whether the solution which Irma failed to accept and that Freud felt reproachful about was not also a wish of a different sort: the wish for</page><page sequence="13">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 183 the foreign ma-ma's return and a reestablishment of this builder of his confidence—not to mention the first libidinal attachment that he remembered from his early childhood. This wish is camouflauged in the names of the female dream characters, which are weaved together by the single syllable "ma". Ma does not appear in any of the male char acters' names. The dream is a ubiquitous searching and it seems quite plausible that the latent aim of "trying to find" the source of Irma's symptoms is to a great extent recapitu lating a time when he was searching desperately for another "solution"—his lost mother. The Irma dream and the cupboard incident parallel in other ways. The difficulty that Freud has in examining Irma's mouth is much like the difficulty in examining the cupboard. As an example of their parallel, Freud mechanizes and objectifies Irma's mouth when it opens in the dream. Mahoney (1977) notes this, and suggests that it is one ex ample of Freud's inferiorization of women throughout the dream. What strikes deeper into the latent content, however, is that Irma's mouth is mechanized for a purpose. Perhaps, he says, "her mouth opens properly" {"Der Mund, geht dann auch gut auf') instead of "she opened her mouth," because of the childhood connection to the remembrance of opening the empty cupboard. Later, in The Interpretation of Dreams, he specifically mentions this phrasing as an example of dreams that can be interpreted by the enigmatic quality of their wording. Freud (1901) himself said that he anthropomorph izes the cupboard as a mother-like object. If this was Freud's pattern of thought, then the mechanization of Irma's mouth may serve as a similar disguise; only in the dream, it is the wish fulfillment of a woman that is objectified. Freud (1900) reports an incomplete feeling when asso ciating to this dream fragment: "I had a feeling that the interpretation of this part of the dream was not carried far enough to make it possible to follow the whole of its con cealed meaning" (p. Ill), and then refers to this as "a navel" in this dream. This portion of the dream is indeed the dream's turning point because of the many changes in its character. Before the opening of Irma's mouth, all the other characters are females. When the mouth opens, there</page><page sequence="14">184 Timothy Anderson is a rather sharp transition to male characters who partici pate in the dream's action. The opening of Irma's mouth is a transition for the dreamer as well. Earlier, Freud is clearly the active char acter who takes Irma asside, reproaches her for not accepting the "solution," and takes her to the window. Freud's initia tive vanishes with the opening of the mouth. In fact, after a fleeting call to Dr. M. for help, his active presence com pletely disappears from the dream. Freud becomes the thoughtful observer while his reproached colleagues con tinue the examination. There is some indication that the opening of the mouth may be a regression of Freud's ego in this dream, again drawing a closer parallel between the cupboard memory, the dream, and Freud's mood. In the course of the dreamer's examination, it is noticed that a portion of Irma's left shoulder was affected. Freud identifies this as his own rheumatism, and thus transforms himself as a part of Irma. Again, this relates to Freud's (1917) theory of depres sion. In cases where the mourning is extensive, he says, the individual who experiences the loss will not only identify with, but experience the wish to psychically become that lost object. Possibly, the grief was so intense after the cupboard was opened, and juxtapositionally when the mouth was opened in the dream, that Freud temporarily slipped from an anaclitic to a narcissistic object relation with his patient, perhaps the height of conflict in the entire dream, before a second revised solution was revealed in the disguise of a formula. This formula is initially opaque in the fragments "pro pyl... propyls... propionic acid." The sensation of smelling the propionic acid would be much the same as when the bottle of Ananas liqueur was opened the night of the dream. The formula then is elucidated as "trimethyla min" which is associated to the discussions of sexual me tabolism with Fliess. There is a continuous quality between the dream elements "propyl... propyls ... propionic acid" and "trimethylamin," perhaps suggesting that there may be some value in connecting the associations to these two ele ments as well. The latent meaning is clearer when the affect</page><page sequence="15">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 185 of smelling the nauseous Ananas is combined with intellec tual discussions of sexuality with Fliess, representing an abasement of the sexual affect, and latently parallel to the awakening flame of his sexuality. It is worth noting that the smell from Ananas is another example of a noisome sensation brought on by the act of "opening." Freud associates "propyls" to the similar sound ing "propylea," another example of an earlier, though quite historically antedated, opening. He relates "propylea" to vis iting Fliess the year before the Irma dream. Again, this "opening" is connected to a visit with Fliess, an issue which was fresh in Freud's mind on the day of the dream: "Are we friends only in misfortune?" Certainly, Freud is questioning Fliess about this trip (when Freud viewed the Propylea in Munich) since this visit was occasioned by the above men tioned misfortune. It is the anticipation which surrounded such visits (especially the August 1895 trip) that resembles a personally antedated incident, the forlorn expectation of finding his mother in the "opening" of the cupboard. Within the manifest dream, too, Irma's "opening" serves as a pivotal element within the dream's content. Freud himself was apparently somewhat aware of how the formula was tied to his relations with other females. He footnotes in his associations how Ananas sounds like Irma's family name, and then continues to relate how the bottle of liqueur was of such a stench that no one was allowed to drink it. Perhaps Freud wasn't aware of the extent of relat ing Ananas to the females in his life. Anzieu (1959) has suggested that Ananas is actually closer to Irma's real first name (Anna Hammerschlag), rather than what Freud noted as a similarity to her family name. However, Ananas comes remarkably close phonetically to a condensation of Irma's first name and the maiden name of Freud's wife who is the only other female in the dream: ANNA [BerlNAYS ANNANAYS equal to Ananas Although there are slight differences in spelling and pronunciation, the similarity is quite remarkable consider</page><page sequence="16">186 Timothy Anderson ing that this condensation is made of both female characters in the dream. While Freud makes the presumed mistake of noting the similarity of Ananas to Irma's family name, he revealed in other dreams that the disguised character was in fact his wife. Since Freud said that Ananas was similar to the last name of his patient, was he aware of such a conden sation on some level of consciousness? The pregnancy that Martha was carrying at the time of this dream was to be named Anna after the Irma in this dream. That Irma had a non-sexual status is clear from Freud's remarks about this dream. Martha joins Irma's non-sexual status through re turning to a virginal state by retaining her maiden name. Thus, concealed beneath the venomous "mother in a bottle" is an additional solution, a wish that she return to a previ ous state in which she would not be tainted by the corrupt ing influences of another man. The returning of the mother to a non-sexual state is actually a wish that was fulfilled in the cupboard incident. Freud recalls that when his mother returned, she appeared particularly slim and that this was probably due to the birth of his sister Anna. Thus, the wish to be free from this little liked sister may have been a constant reminder of the com petitor's corrupting influence, and a similarly irritating af fect on the opening of Ananas. This may be part of the unconscious motivations for the event working its way into the dream's content: Just as there was the wish to be rid of this bottle at any cost, the younger Freud would have been just as glad to abolish this constant reminder of his father's presence. The wish to be rid of this early sibling rivalry is also found in "Mathilda," who like Anna, represents the name of Freud's (first born) daughter and one of his frequently encountered patients. Freud uses the name of one of his children to unconsciously express the wish to attain the ex clusive attentions of the mother. The connection between both Mathilda's is explained by Freud's association of calling for Breuer's assistance in the dream: It was as though the replacement of one person by another was to be continued in another sense: this Ma</page><page sequence="17">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 187 thilda for that Mathilda, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It seemed as if I had been collecting all the occasions which I could bring up against myself as evi dence of lack of medical conscientiousness (Freud, 1900, p. 112). That Freud was searching for reproaches which could be brought up against himself is compatible with his depres sion at the time of the dream in light of his own theory of depression discussed earlier. Considering the nature of the name Mathilda discussed above, it may be, 'this ma for that ma', and a reproach against both for their absence. Quite early in life, Freud certainly had to adjust to such substitu tions: first, there is the transferring of trust to his Amme from mother, then this new libidinal tie was severed in an untimely fashion when she was arrested. Freud quotes "An eye for an eye" (Exodus 21.22-25), the Hebrew law of punishment when men harm a pregnant woman. This could be easily integrated into Elms' (1980) interpretation of the dream as displacing Freud's concerns about the size of his family, and the unconscious wish to abort Martha's pregnancy. Perhaps, Freud unconsciously used the cliche "an eye for an eye..." without realizing that it applied to such punishment. Mathilda ("this Mathilda for that Mathilda") was his first born daughter, and the first intruder on the affections for his wife. This may be reminis cent of another intruder, the eight month old brother Julius who died when Freud was 18 months old. Yet this too can be traced to the cupboard incident. Freud remembered when his mother returned that she was particularly slim and beautiful, and this apparently was due to just giving birth to his sister Anna. Freud (1901) may have wished a miscarriage: The child of not yet three had understood that the little sister who had recently arrived had grown inside his mother. He was very far from approving of this addi tion to the family, and was full of mistrust and anxiety that his mother's inside might conceal still more chil dren (p. 51).</page><page sequence="18">188 Timothy Anderson Further, the little that is known about Freud's later re lationship with his mother is an indication that the dream applies to his own theory of depression. Jones (1953) writes of the closeness between Freud and his mother, and Leh mann (1983) notes Freud's lack of grief on the death of his mother expressed in two letters to Jones and Ferenczi fol lowing her death. Freud felt that his own reaction was "pe culiar," attributing this to her old age in addition to his own fear of dying before her. Does this terrifying fear of dying before his mother represent a projection onto her of a fear of being abandoned? Certainly, Freud was made aware of parental loss by the onset of his father's terminal illness in the very month of the dream. If the seventy-five year old Freud re-experienced the loss of his mother in a similar manner as when he was precariously left in the hands of his brother as a child, then it should be expected that the "fear of abandonment" was one which constantly plagued him throughout life. It should be remembered that Freud only became aware of the memory of the cupboard scene through his own dreams, and that the Irma dream falls in the general period which just preceeded the discovery of this memory. Since Freud recovered the event slowly through several dreams in 1897, and since the recovery of this memory was itself one of the highlights of his self-analysis, this memory may have un consciously played rather prominently in earlier, more dis guised dreams. The latent dream may have "worked its way" to the formation of the manifest dream through the develop ing "transference" relationship with Fliess, which affectively culminated in the previously unreleased letter which bears the same date as the dream. It was the "loss" of Fliess which Freud reacted to on waking from the Irma dream ("Are we friends only in misfortune?"). This yearning for a reunion is also found in the cupboard incident and, as shown, is dis guised in the dream's content. The wish, then, of finding the mother is further quali fied in the solution. Its association to Ananas not only leads to the wish of unconsciously finding her, but of attaining her exclusive attention, and expunging the reminder of her previous associations with his male competitors.</page><page sequence="19">The Specimen Dream as a Childhood Trauma 189 My interpretation should be seen as an addition to, rather than as competing with, the current literature on the dream. Yet, what can be said of the validity of this interpre tation in light of recent suggestions by Eissler (1985) that the Irma dream was a concoction? While it is the irony with which Eissler argues that reveals the more essential point concerning the bounds of Freudian biography, the question of the dream's authenticity remains. The primary evidence for this notion is Van Velzen's (1984) argument that Freud was attempting to conceal Emma Eckstein through the clue Ananas, which leads to the connection with Anna Ham merschlag. Indeed, Van Velzen suggests that Ananas was "too obvious" a clue. The evidence I have given, however, suggests that Ananas is not only a representation for Anna Hammerschlag, but also for a condensation with Freud's wife, the only other female in the dream. If the association of Ananas to Anna is "too obvious" a clue, then the possible condensation of both dream characters is even more reveal ing of possible latent motivations. It is increasingly appar ent, moreover, when considering the variety of data that make good psychological sense within the Irma dream, along with the nuances of meaning that weave it together at several levels, that even if it were possible to contrive this dream, it would certainly be worthy of at least the amount of analysis given to it thus far.
