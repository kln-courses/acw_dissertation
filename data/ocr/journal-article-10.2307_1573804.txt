Rizzoli, New York, 1976. 236 pp., illus. $14.95. Reviewed by Joseph Adler* The 14 essays in this book all explore from their own particular perspectives the theme of bachelor machines. They present a bewildering journey through 20th-Century iconography and offer little assistance to any'newcomer to the mechano-morphic world of Duchamp and his contemporaries, except for the short biographical details that are included at the back. The book was published in conjunction with a series of exhibitions on the same subject and its copious supply of black and white illustrations give an intriguing insight into what can best be described as modern mythology. One of the book's more outstanding features is the diversity of its illustrations, which enable it to go some way towards fulfilling the editor's objective-'to visualise the myth!' For here the images of Saturn, St. Theresa, Barbarella, Frankenstein and many others are juxtaposed with an amazing collection of machine para- phernalia, thus compounding a fascinating view of 'bachelor machines'. The text, on the other hand, forms a major weakness. It is often tortured by translation or by the absence of any coherent thesis. There are discussions on the 'anthropomorphism of the machine'; on the writer Casares, Picabia, Roussel and on other correlated issues. Some of these are of a dull socio-historical nature, while others are lost in the penumbra of metaphysical confusion. This is not true of Peter Gorsen's interesting examination of the sexual symbolism of the machine, and Marc Le Bot provides relief with a pleasantly lucid discussion on the myth of the machine. Also included is Michel Carrouges's analysis in which he identifies the bachelor machine metaphor and traces it in the works of Poe, Jarry, Kafka, Duchamp and others. Furthermore, we are presented with a reiteration of Arturo Schwartz's alchemical interpretation of 'The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even', where Duchamp's esoteric work is dissected with a distinctly Jungian scapel. The book powerfully represents how ideas displaced from science and technology have permeated culture, in general, and the visual arts, in particular. Unfortunately, science and technology themselves have not been considered more closely in relationship to art. So what could have been a truly revealing discussion on the art-science nexus has turned out to be a nocturnal perambulation. Hyperrealism. Linda Chase. Rizzoli, New York, 1975. 76 pp., illus. Paper, $7.50. Super Realism: A Critical Anthology. Gregory Battcock, ed. Dutton, New York, 1975. 322 pp., illus. Paper, $6.95. Reviewed by Donna Stein** Two new books discuss the recent stylistic phenomena variously known as New Realism, Super Realism, Hyperrealism, New Realities, Photo Realism, etc. Hyperrealism by Linda Chase is an English translation of a book first published in French in 1973. In large format, it is profusely illustrated in black and white and contains numerous good color reproductions. Chase's essay considers how the painter uses a photograph: to make paintings about how the camera sees, to make paintings about how the eye sees and as a technical discipline. She weaves pertinent quotes by the artists into the text and carefully provides a vocabulary by which to analyze and comprehend the New Realist art.

Super Realism b.y Gregory Battcock belongs to his series of critical anthologies and is a compendium of articles divided into four parts-What is Super Realism; Theory and Criticism; The Artists; Gallery of Art Works. Some of the chapters were previously published in art periodicals. Each section of his anthology includes different views in an effort to present a complete picture of the movement. Before each article there is a short synopsis by the editor, detailing the basic approach of the author. Numerous photographs, mainly in black and white, illustrate the volume, providing a visual counterpart from which to understand the style. Both of these books are recommended for their usefulness in understanding the technical, aesthetic and iconographic concerns of this popular style. The World as Non-Objectivity: Unpublished Writings 1922-25. Vol. 3. K. S. Malevich. Trans. by Xenia Glowacki-Prus and Edmund T. Little. Troels Anderson, ed. Borgen, Copenhagen, 1976. 376 pp., illus. Paper. Reviewed by Ilya Bolotowsky: Malevich discusses at length how he views reality and the place that art, religion, science and technology occupy in the world. He relegates objectivity to science and technology and 'non- objectivity' to art and religion. Physical matter he considers to be neutral and unchanging. Science and technology deal with objects and phenomena and with problems of measurements, of objects in motion, of providing food and shelter. These activities he places, rather derisively, under the 'tavern system'. According to him, it is 'non-objectivity' in art and religion that produces the true, meaningful world and makes humans different from animals. On the other hand, animals take care of their needs without the encumbrance of technology. He makes a number of other assertions. Technology deals with work and rest. Rest, however, is not repose. The state of the repose, peace of mind and harmony, is achieved through art and religion. With the passage of time, science and technology suffer from obsolescence, while masterpieces of art do not. There is no such thing as progress in art. Old art in the museums still functions as art. An icon placed in a museum no longer functions as a religious symbol but lives on as art. Each new historical period must, however, develop its own new art form. Malevich inweighs against the barrenness in his time of the Soviet governmental policy of boycotting nontraditional 'avant- garde' art and of forcing Renaissance and 'peredvizhniki' (Russian 19th-century didactic realism) models on Soviet fine art. Such a policy he is convinced stifles cultural development and also has a detrimental effect in the political sphere. This was written in 1925, and I find that events have proved Malevich to be right. Malevich states that 'non-objective' architecture cannot be utilitarian. Undoubtedly, some in the Bauhaus who believed in the marriage of art and industry may have disagreed. A utilitarian building for Malevich is an engineering production. To find the closest to an example of 'non-objective' architecture, one may have to look for a constructivist work rather than a building. Yet, Malevich is opposed to Constructivism. He says it is a 'production art' and, therefore, not truly art, since production, unlike art, is an objective kind of activity. Malevich also disagrees with Mondrian, who wrote that subjectivism is dangerous and must be controlled by the conscious, objective intellect. Like Mondrian, Malevich considers repose and harmony to be the aim of art. But Mondrian rejects empty pictorial space as a mere void. He defines pictorial space with straight lines crossing each other at 90 degrees, which he asserts has equilibrium. Malevich's acceptance of empty pictorial space was prophetic of some developments in painting about 50 years later. In one of the essays Malevich attempts to 'non-objectivize' Lenin as the new savior and Leninism as the new religion. Was he trying to give unto Caesar what is Caesar's so that Caesar would relent and get the government to support the kind of work tP.O.
