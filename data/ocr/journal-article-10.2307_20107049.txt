<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harry E. Shaw Loose Narrators: Display, Engagement, and the Search for a Place in History in Realist Fiction Literary critics tend to skirt the question of whether theirs is a field that pro gresses. (In the heat of critical battle, anxieties about whether one is "up-to-date" or "naive" gather, but that's a different matter.) By any reasonable standard, it would seem that narratologists need not be so modest. Controversies may erupt around terms and concepts, and alternative narratological systems may vie for preeminence. In part because of the very proliferation of terms and systems, however, narratology has revealed a host of subtleties that lay hidden a genera tion ago. Perfect clarity seems nonetheless elusive. The question of who or what de serves to be called a "narrator" is a case in point. In the early eighties, Dorrit Cohn praised as "salutary" a concept introduced by Franz Stanzel "if only be cause it should put a stop once and for all to the sloppy habit of calling the pro tagonists of figurai novels (Stephen of the Portrait, Gregor Samsa, or Strether) the 'narrators' of their stories" (171). G?rard Genette concurred with this judg ment, though in translating Cohn's remark into French, he omitted the phrase "once and for all."1 Edited or not, Cohn's dark vehemence seems noteworthy. (Put a stop? Once and for all?) Five years ago, another critic announced that it was "high time" that another terminological distinction be introduced to prevent confusion between narrators and characters (Chatman 143). Cries that it's "high time" that something be done crop up in trying contexts. Speakers reach for this locution as they write letters to the editor or assert parental authority. The Tight ness of their cause is obvious enough ("It's high time you cleaned up your room!"), but they know that their addressees may not see it that way. More than likely and in the teeth of reason, they 11 refuse to bring order out of chaos. Harry E.

Shaw Why should firm, self-evident distinctions about the narrator's nature and presence threaten to come unstuck, especially when they have proved their use fulness over time? Why, indeed, should the roll call of delinquents in this matter include . . . none other than G?rard Genette himself? Strict narratology has accused Genette, founder of the distinction between "seeing" and "speaking" in narratives, of muddying the very waters he had cleared (Chatman 145). When Genette suggests that "first-person" narratives employ "focalization through the narrator," he seems to imply that the narrator can somehow "see" the events of the story unfold, as one of the characters would. But it was Genette himself who insisted that narrators "speak," and only characters "see." Why would he blur the line he himself had so usefully drawn? Slips like this one might occur simply because describing narrative situa tions presents knotty problems. When the going gets tough, our speech can wander. Yet an eminent philosopher reminds us that it's a sign of intellectual ma turity to require of discussions only the degree of precision that can be reason ably expected of their subjects. We shouldn't expect a rhetorician to be as precise as a mathematician. (There is no mention of narratologists in the text.) Could more than "sloppiness" or obtuseness be involved when critics find themselves referring to fictional characters as "narrators," even when they don't in fact nar rate? Might it be that attempts to set such matters straight, "once and for all" and beyond the chance of backsliding, are misguided? J. L. Austin liked to ex plore linguistic practices, instead of avoiding them with streamlined terminology. After his death certain followers put his ideas about performative utterances in order, ridding them of looseness and imprecision. Has their work rendered his obsolete? No recent narratologist has written more persuasively of the importance of making secure distinctions than Seymour Chatman, whose ambitious and illu minating study, Coming to Terms, seeks to bring into order the vocabulary we use to describe narrators and narration. For Chatman, the talisman that will clarify our grasp of what we used to call "point of view" is a strict adherence to Genette's distinction between "mood" ("Who sees?") and "voice" ("Who speaks?"). Chatman reminds us that "seeing" is a property of characters alone, "telling" a property of narrators alone. We should respect the impermeable "membrane" (144) stretched between "story space" (in which the characters "see" things as they experience the events of the story) and "discourse space" (in which the nar rator "speaks" as he tells the story). "I do not deny," says Chatman, "that the narrator has a point of view (or 'slant'), but I do deny that the narrator can in habit both discourse and story at the instant of narration (except, of course, in embedded narration). . . . Discourse space," he claims, " must not be confused with the story space that it looks out upon" (123).2 With Chatman's segregation of discourse space from story space goes a wish to depersonalize the narrator. Sometimes, this seems simply to reflect a wish to make room for non-human narrators as a necessary supplement: "we need a defi nition of 'narrator,'" he tells us, "which can allow for non-human as well as hu man, nongendered as well as gendered agents" (122). Yet non-human narrators</page><page sequence="3">Loose Narrators 97 often seem the theoretical norm: we're warned, for example, against succumbing to the "anthropomorphic bias of 'narrator'" (119). We might ascribe this judg ment to the preference narratology often betrays for twentieth-century works, so full of narratological display and inhuman narration. Perhaps more important is Chatman's interest in creating a narratology that can include filmic as well as verbal narrative. Chatman wants films as well as novels to have narrators, and filmic narrators of the sort his theory requires can hardly be imagined as speak ing human beings. Beyond that, there's a clear logic in wishing to depersonalize a narrator who is to be rigidly excluded from "story space." If the narrator isn't a person, and isn't like a person, it will be easier to keep narrative functions strictly separate from the functions of characters. If, .by contrast, we humanize the nar rator (or, to shift assumptions, refuse to dehumanize the narrator)?perhaps on the grounds that we comprehend both narrators and fictional characters by using the competencies that allow us to understand the human beings we see and hear in our daily lives?then the division between story space and discourse space may have a tendency to melt away, particularly when certain kinds of rhetorical appeals heat up. Chatman presents his sharp separation of "seeing" from "telling" as a matter of simple and irrefutable common-sense logic. It comes to seem less a matter of terminological convenience than a law of nature. For all of that, the separation makes me uneasy, particularly with respect to the fictional works that most inter est me, nineteenth-century realist novels. In what follows, I shall explore what we stand to lose if we depersonalize the narrator, and cut "discourse space" cleanly off from "story space." Ill argue that a humanized, mobile narrative pres ence makes itself felt in realist novels in ways that seem anything but transgres s?e of their norms. This suggests that talk of humanized narrators who can enter story space may have some validity and interest after all. My examination of such talk will produce three claims. (1) Critics find themselves speaking of narrators as characters who sometimes enter story space, because a central en deavor of the novel is to explore and celebrate the ways in which we use our human equipment to make sense of the world, and this endeavor touches the narrator as surely as it touches everything else in a novel. (2) When critics speak in ways that imply a breakdown of the line between story space and discourse space, it's likely that they are dealing with narrative situations in which other boundaries have been breached as well?especially those separating story space from "real life," and the narrator from the reader.3 Categorical distinctions be tween narrators and characters are likely to fade at moments in which the narra tor's presence seems overwhelmingly palpable. The narrator becomes much more than a reporter, peering over the hedge of an estate he cannot enter and telling us what's transpiring there. At such moments, narrators seem to break loose from the normal confines of discourse space. (3) Attempting to account for moments when humanized narrators break normal narratological boundaries can lead us to qualify the assumption that narratological categories are timeless, in the sense of being immune to historical process and taking precedence over the cultural categories history creates. In George Eliot, for instance, we can observe the emer</page><page sequence="4">98 Harry E. Shaw gence of what I shall call a "historicized narrator," in consonance with a charac teristically nineteenth-century vision of where we are, all of us, in the historical stream. Arguments about whether it's permissible to suggest that narrators can es cape discourse space or invade story space are, in the end, arguments about the uses of metaphor. The very notion of "story space" is itself a metaphor: the only space literally occupied by narratives is space on our shelves. All critical meta phors require discriminating use. The imagery they bring to bear on the text may obscure it. We always need to decide how to apply that imagery, which of the in terpretative possibilities it offers to stress and which to ignore. Concluding that the idea that narrators could enter story space is self-evidently absurd may answer too quickly and cleanly the question of how we should use the metaphor of "story space." It precludes in advance the possibility of one kind of confusion. Does it also cordon off certain areas that deserve a closer look? Some loose nar rators are characterized by their impulse to enter story space, not by their actual entry, but such a distinction can hardly arise if a narrator's entry into story space is seen as a simple contradiction in terms. Nor could we describe more complex situations, such as the one well discover in Daniel Deronda, where one aspect of the narrator seems to enter the fictional world, while another aspect remains well out of it, observing and judging from a height. Loose narrators are interesting because of the affect their looseness creates and transmits. They add intensity to fiction, and sometimes they do more?they claim our attention because of what they reveal about the place of history in fic tion, and fiction in history. Without a critical vocabulary that allows us to dis criminate between the different roles these narrators assume in their boundary stretching and breaking, and to register the range of affect they create, it be comes difficult to discuss, indeed to recognize, some significant ways in which novels and novelists attempt to find a place in history?and to force their readers to attend to their own places in history. "HUMAN" NARRATORS IN STORY SPACE Why might critics find themselves describing a narrator as if the narrator were human and could enter story space? One reason is that such a mode of speaking, however loose, can help to indicate how narrators participate in one of the novel's fundamental enterprises. A principal justification for the existence of novels is their ability to explore and celebrate, with richness and depth and at considerable length, how it is that human beings make sense of the social and historical world around them, by using the basic kit of perceptual and linguistic tools that has developed as history itself has developed. Novels matter to us, and give us pleasure, largely because they demonstrate ways in which sense can be made of our world, and because they exercise our own powers of sense-making as we deal with their worlds.4 In Eliot, the exploration of our everyday social and linguistic competencies</page><page sequence="5">Loose Narrators 99 usually takes on high seriousness, creating a lively sense of our shortcomings (we cannot hear the squirrel's heartbeat and would go mad if we did) to fuel a stern injunction that we do better with our flawed equipment than we're doing at pres ent. But at times in Eliot, and often in Dickens, there appears something closer to simple celebration. This celebration is often accomplished by a narrator who reveals a verbal and perceptual power that is denied to any character, but that nonetheless seems a heroic extension of capabilities the characters do possess and we as readers share. The Dickensian narrator displays rich imaginative and lin guistic possibilities. To demonstrate the use of human powers, the narrator speaks with a recognizably human voice; to demonstrate these powers as flamboyantly as possible, he sometimes seems to walk through the wall separating story space and discourse space, as he does in the opening paragraph of Dombey and Son: Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead, care fully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin, and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new. Chatman (from whom I borrow this example) presents this passage to support his argument that story space is sharply distinct from discourse space. No one, he rightly suggests, supposes that Mr. Dombey is "the maker of the analogy" here. Similarly erroneous, according to Chatman, is the idea that the muffin analogy results from the "point of view" of the narrator, for such an analysis would suggest that the narrator enters story space. "The narrator," Chatman tells us, "is not to be imagined as literally contemplating the new baby and deciding, in that contemplation, that he resembles a muffin." Instead, "the narrator is per forming his usual task of reporting this scene, and he introduces the muffin analogy the better to convey its unique flavor" (141-42). But why couldn't the narrator's activity in the passage involve something more energetic than contemplation? Might not the notion that the narrator has somehow entered story space provide a more telling metaphor for what's occur ring in the text at this moment than would any account that scrupulously insu lates the narrator from story space? The idea that the passage is simply a report, however flavorful, doesn't square with the scene's vibrant wit. We seem to see the muffin analogy being produced before our very eyes. In this passage and others like it, the narrator is best described as imitating the role of someone who has happened upon the scene, is struck by it, and possesses the rare facility of being able to capture it in a spontaneous, instantaneous image that crystallizes the expe rience (and often the ideology) it embodies, adding a surplus of sheer imaginative energy.5 We catch Boz in the act of taking the muffin out of the oven. The ability to convey a shock of recognition, achieved in an instant of time, is at the heart of Dickens' imaginative power. How better to communicate that power, and to celebrate it as arising from the quintessential^ human act of mastering social reality through language, than to perform an imitation of a mind reacting within</page><page sequence="6">100 Harry E. Shaw the story space?and thereby to invite us to enter that space as well? And how appropriate for Dickens, the nineteenth-century British novelist who most insis tently makes his characters perform for us, to put his own narrator on stage as well. INVADING STORY SPACE FROM BOTH BORDERS When characters and narrators mingle, it's likely that normal fictional limits are being strained in a number of ways. What is often at stake is an appeal to the reader. I'd put the general case in this way: whenever critical talk raises the spec ter of a violation of the line between story space and discourse space, it's likely that it does so in response to narration with immediate and dramatic designs on the reader, narration that wishes to place the world of the reader in a strongly dynamic, even uncomfortable, relationship with the world of the novel. Some times, as in the "muffin" passage from Dombey, the point is simply to astonish and delight us with what the narrator can do; even here, the narrator forsakes the role of mere reporter, as his doing becomes for the moment even more strik ing than that which he does. More often, what's at issue is an attempt to generate sufficient affect to goad the reader to recognize strong, demanding links between the world of the fiction and the reader's world. A narratology that's most com fortable with treating novels as self-contained artifacts and that prizes metafic tional play is likely to find such attempts flat-footed and counterproductive; in deed, it may attempt to define them out of existence. It isn't always necessary for authors with immediate designs on the reader to violate the boundary between discourse space and story space: raising the possi bility of such a violation (and thus "thematizing" the border) will sometimes suffice. Toward the end of A Room with a View, the narrator comments as fol lows upon the heroine's confusion about which of the two men in her life she really loves: It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, "She loves young Emerson." A reader in Lucy's place would not find it obvious. Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome "nerves" or any other shibbo leth that will cloak our personal desire. [Lucy kept saying to herself that] she loved Cecil; [and that] George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed? (164) Could a narrator indicate more clearly than this how insurmountable are the boundaries between story space, discourse space, and the world of the reader? By assigning us the impossible task of speaking to his heroine, the narrator forcibly reminds us that such speech is impossible. He does other things as well. The task itself seems offered in response to an exasperated (though?and here's one source of the passage's humor?necessarily unheard) cry from the reader: "Why doesn't someone straighten this young woman out!" The narrator's implicit response</page><page sequence="7">Loose Narrators 101 then becomes a rather cheeky, "I can't straighten her out. I'm just a narrator, not a character. Why don't you try?" On another level, this translates into, "Yes, I know you're feeling exasperated now, but remember that your pleasure in novels like this one?including the pleasurably disturbing exasperation you're feeling now?depends upon abiding by certain rules in this fictional game of ours."6 Yet the force of the passage doesn't stop quite there, either. Even though the passage insists on the impenetrability of the barriers be tween Lucy's world, our world, and the world of the narrator, the ultimate effect here is to make us feel akin to Lucy, not distant from her?to remind us that our world obeys the same rules that hers does. By teasing us about our inability to set Lucy straight, the narrator sets in motion a series of proliferating equiva lences, which in the end minimize categorical differences between us, Lucy, and even the narrator himself. Lucy can't understand her feelings and we can under stand her feelings, but then we can't explain them to her. By the same token, if we were in Lucy's place and she in ours, our superior knowledge would vanish, but she'd then be unable to help us. For that matter, the narrator can't talk to Lucy either; and he himself admits that in his own sphere (wherever that may be), life is harder to practice than to observe. And so on. It seems, in short, that we're all in the same boat after all. Though the passage initially and formally re spects the barrier Chatman erects between story space and discourse space, it wants us to conclude that in crucial aspects they and the reader's space are the same. Nothing could seem more foreign from the technique Forster employs here than a mode of narratorial address that flourished in nineteenth-century realist novels, which Robyn Warhol, in a remarkable contribution to narratology, has recently identified as "engaging narration." Where Forster's narrator begins by insisting on the boundaries between the characters, narrator, and reader, War hol's "engaging narrator" begins by spilling over them. The engaging narrator seeks to narrow or efface the distance between narratee and real reader, as in the following passage from Uncle Tom's Cabin, which defends the celebrated scene in which Eliza spirits her son child away from the slave traders: If it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow morning,?if you had seen the man, and heard that the papers were signed and delivered, and you had only from twelve o'clock till morning to make good your escape,?how fast could you walk? (105) Even the specificity of the narratee addressed in this passage, Warhol points out, is unlikely to exclude readers who aren't mothers with children named Harry or Willie: "The narrator requires the reader to exercise his or her imagination in such a way as to draw out the parental feelings that may be active or latent in his or her real life, and, having evoked those real feelings, implores the reader to di rect them at the characters" (113-14). The differences between Forster's realism and Stowe's are clear enough.</page><page sequence="8">102 Harry E. Shaw Forster accepts as self-evident the existence of firm barriers separating the worlds of characters, readers, and narrators?and then wittily works his way around them by drawing attention to their very firmness. Stowe creates a moment in the text that is so heavily rhetorical (or, as Warhol usefully puts it, "transactional"), so fully intent on communicating emotion and evoking action, that such barriers lose their importance. We haven't time or breath to register her narrative interjec tion as a knowing violation of anything, and certainly not as a witty play with accepted, ineluctable norms. Instead, we react to it as embodying a central, per haps the central impetus of her fiction. Yet in the end, there is a similarity of purpose in Forster's command that we set Lucy straight, and Stowe's pleas that we think of our Harry or Willy in assessing the probabilities of her story. Both authors are defending the realism of their representations by asking us to draw on our experience in our own worlds as a way of understanding the fictional world?a technique that itself lowers the threshold between the two worlds. In both Forster's witty commentary and Stowe's earnest exhortation, narrative ac tivity that calls narratological boundaries into question goes hand in hand with the creation of a dynamic engagement between the reader's world and the fic tional world. A sensitivity to this kind of dynamism accounts, I think, for the commen tary of two critics Chatman has reproved for blurring the distinction between story space and discourse space in their analyses of Hemingway's "The Killers." Roger Fowler describes the narrator of that story in terms that both humanize him and make him cross the line from discourse space to story space: according to Fowler, during most of the story the narrator provides "a definite viewing po sition, like a fixed camera"; in the scene in which Nick visits Ole Andreson, the narrator is "an invisible man who walks in step with Nick, stands close beside him, sees exactly and only what his eyes see (but not with Nick's eyes: there is no penetration of Nick's consciousness)" (74). In Chatman's eyes, such talk is simply confused: "The narrator's task is not to go strolling with the characters but to narrate what happens to them" (120), he remarks. I believe that Fowler's account registers a central effect of the story, created by its positioning of the reader. The reader walks with Nick; the reader is placed in the lunchroom. A venerable tech nique for making room for the reader in a work of fiction involves creating a character who serves as the reader's stand-in or delegate: this is an important function of the Waverley hero and (to a lesser extent) of James's ficelle. Fowler's transformation of the narrator into a "character" suggests that the narrator is ful filling this function, as does Susan Lanser (who also draws Chatman's fire for her comments on the story's narrator), who insists that the narrator knows precisely as much as the townspeople in the story know, and thus acts as a kind of honor ary townsperson.7 I'd argue that the story wants to make us honorary towns people too. Hemingway's aim in the story, as in much of his fiction, is to persuade us that a certain kind of stoicism (shall we call it, as evoked by this story, supine and mindless?) is noble and heroic, because to those who truly see, the world offers no real alternative. To make this ethic credible, "The Killers" seeks to place</page><page sequence="9">Loose Narrators 103 us right at the level of those on whom the assassination attempt suddenly im pinges. It cannot afford to offer the possibility of any kind of transcendence for the characters, the narrator, or the reader. Fowler's analysis of the story suggests that even the narrator is tied to its particular place and time. Experiencing a story world with nothing outside it can create a powerful immediacy. When we're told that Nick (tied up and gagged by the gangsters) had never had a towel in his mouth before, we taste the towel. For Chatman, the focus of the story is rather different. With the narrator (and reader) cordoned off from story space, "The Killers" inevitably finds its center in Nick: it is about "the impact on his youthful consciousness of the harshness of the world" (122). Such a reading leaves to in ference the story's designs on the reader. By chancing "illogical" descriptions of the narrator, Fowler and Lanser, by contrast, point to the central affective force of the story. Is it unfair to say that, to the extent to which we accept Chatman's categorical imperatives, we will find it difficult to describe (and perhaps even to experience) that force? Talk of the narrator as an "invisible character" may run the risk of sounding imprecise, illogical, and even a bit silly, but it's hardly talk about nothing. HISTORY AND NARRATORS I have been attempting to explain why critics might wish to talk of human ized narrators who enter story space. I now turn to the question of why nineteenth century realist authors might wish to create such a narrator. To find an answer, it will be helpful to return to the picture Chatman paints of the narrator's place in fiction. The narrator, we recall, has his space; the characters in the story have theirs. The narrator "looks out on" the space of the story, but a glass wall sepa rates him from it. He narrates what happens in the world, but by definition (and in a way that recalls the impossibility of two objects' occupying the same space at the same time) he cannot enter that space, either to act in it or even to "see" the events that transpire within it. Realism as it's often described would seem to exemplify perfectly Chatman's dictum that "we must recognize in discourse space a separateness analogous to the space on this side of a pane of glass or camera lens" (123). Doesn't realism claim to show us the world objectively, from a point of view scrupulously free from the "personal" biases so apparent in the charac ters who act in the stories it tells? Isn't the separation of realism's narrator from the realm of the story a guarantee of realist truth? Critics of realism have been quick to point out an inconsistency in the real ist project if it is so conceived. Steven Marcus, for instance, complains that George Eliot's fiction offers a radically "sociological" account of human life in history, and then without comment or justification relieves the narrator of the epistemological limits such a view entails. But this is dishonest: the realist narra tor only seems to face up to the complexities of history, while in fact exempting himself from their workings.8 For "sociological" here we might better read "his toricist." Eliot's fiction represents the finest flowering of the perception Scott's fie</page><page sequence="10">104 Harry E. Shaw tion first brings to the novel?that all societies, including our own society in the present, are historical. Realism that takes historicity seriously (which is to say all "serious" nineteenth-century realism) will find it necessary to include a recogni tion of our embeddedness in history as one of the conditions of possibility for comprehending, and representing, the real world which is its object. But if realist fiction is realist because it depicts society as historical, it shouldn't leave room for any form of consciousness, including narratorial consciousness, that is not shown to share the historical limitations that help to define the characters it depicts. Thus the categorical distinction between story space and discourse space Chat man insists upon becomes, not a simple matter of logic and definition, but a problem for the realist novelist. If an absolute distinction between the two spaces holds, and if it frees the narrator from the historical constraints that operate in story space, it would still be possible to create fiction that would serve as an es thetic recreation. One could less easily imagine creating fiction that would, in its own conditions of narrative possibility, reflect our situation as historicism would define it. Realist fiction, it appears, would require a historicized narrator. How could a narrator be shown to be subject to history? One way would be to fill the voice and mind of the narrator with an awareness of history, and of our involvement in its workings. In this case, as in the Forster passage we con sidered above, there would be no need to confuse story space and discourse space; they would need only to be equated in the relevant ways. Narrators who are historicized in this sense are common in nineteenth-century realism. Yet there are moments when their resources seem not to suffice, and novelists find them selves drawing upon the affective power they have generated in story space to dramatize the historical nature, not only of their characters, but of their narra tors as well. Realist fiction depicts characters in history: if the narrator's space can be made to seem to merge with theirs, the narrator too will appear to be moving in history. George Eliot grapples with the problem of historicizing the narrator as early as Scenes of Clerical Life, the volume that launched her career as a novelist. Af ter some general experimentation with narrative personality and narrative dis tance, she adopts the first means I've described for historicizing the narrator, and then moves to the second. By the end of the series, a narrator richly aware of historicity finds herself turning her back on the esthetic modes of an earlier age, and entering the historical world of the characters. Scenes of Clerical Life includes three stories, occurring in the same general locale but at different periods in the past. In the first story, set close to the pres ent, Eliot employs a variety of modes of narrative presence and address to manip ulate the distance between the reader and her fiction. To some extent, this may be simple experimentation. It also arises from a well-known aim of Eliot's early realism, her wish to make us take seriously the lives of those who might other wise seem dull and average. Eliot pushes us toward such people, and then pulls us back so that we can observe how we're reacting to them?and more particu larly, whether our reaction is adequately sympathetic. Here again we see that fic tion with immediate designs on the reader tends to make an issue of the barriers separating stories, readers, and narrators.</page><page sequence="11">Loose Narrators 105 The second story in the series is a conscious piece of historical recreation, redolent of British eighteenth-century aristocratic life. In this story, Eliot delights in creating a narrative method that draws on the esthetic decorum of the very pe riod it imitates. She makes repeated use of eighteenth-century architecture and painting, as in the following description of one of the story's principal characters, Lady Cheverel: The elder lady, who is advancing towards the cushions, is . . . tall, and looks the taller because her powdered hair is turned backward over a tou pee, and surmounted by lace and ribbons. She is nearly fifty, but her com plexion is still fresh and beautiful, with the beauty of an auburn blond; her proud pouting lips, and her head thrown a little backward as she walks, give an expression of hauteur which is not contradicted by the cold grey eye. The tucked-in kerchief, rising full over the low tight bodice of her blue dress, sets off the majestic form of her bust, and she treads the lawn as if she were one of Sir Joshua Reynolds's stately ladies, who had suddenly stepped from her frame to enjoy the evening cool. "Put the cushions lower, Caterina, that we may not have so much sun upon us," she called out, in a tone of authority, when still at some distance. (133) The evocation of the painting of Reynolds here serves more than the purpose of character description. It vivifies the process by which, we come to realize, the story itself was created. You meditate upon the artifacts of a period, and sud denly a period setting arises in your mind; figures begin to fill it, stepping from other canvases as Lady Cheverel steps from hers. Passages like this one turn the spotlight on the narrator as re-creator and magician, with a voice that makes the past present: "It is the evening of the 21st of June 1788," this section of the story begins (132). For such a narrator, judgments about characters must take into ac count the complex possibilities of their historical positions. When the narrator defends Lady Cheverel's husband from his neighbor's criticisms?they wonder why he spends his money on architecture and not on wine and hunting dogs? she is also deflecting any wish we as readers might feel simply to dismiss him as an overbearing eighteenth-century aristocrat of a familiar type: As for Sir Christopher, he was perfectly indifferent to criticism. "An obsti nate, crotchety man," said his neighbours. But I, who have seen Cheverel Manor, as he bequeathed it to his heirs, rather attribute that unswerving ar chitectural purpose of his, conceived and carried out through long years of systematic personal exertion, to something of the fervour of genius, as well as inflexibility of will; and in walking through those rooms, with their splendid ceilings and their meagre furniture, which tell how all the spare money had been absorbed before personal comfort was thought of, I have felt that there dwelt in this old English baronet some of that sublime spirit which distin guishes art from luxury, and worships beauty apart from self-indulgence. (159)</page><page sequence="12">106 Harry E. Shaw We hear in this passage a voice that appreciates the extent to which a figure from another historical era would be shaped by the culture surrounding and informing him, and the extent to which he might transcend that culture by employing the means it made available. The heroine of "Gilfil," however, cannot long be contained in the esthetic spaces that frame Lady Cheverel and her husband so nicely. She is a passionate, raven-haired Italian named Tina, who adds a moment of subjective, interior pas sion to the story's world of polished eighteenth-century surfaces. Lest we miss the contrast, Eliot at one point depicts a distraught Tina sitting under the gaze of a portrait that depicts a "fair blonde dame" who "seemed to look down on her with that benignant unconcern, that mild wonder, with which happy self-possessed women are apt to look down on their agitated and weaker sisters" (196). Where interiority prevails, the world of the nineteenth century cannot be far behind. The French Revolution enters the story, as the narrator compares Tina's emotional turmoil to the Revolutionary storms raging across the channel. This comparison occurs twice. The first reference to the French Revolution works metaphorically to annex some of the power of that historical explosion to Tina's inner sufferings; such is the power of metaphor that some have seen in this juxta position an indication that Tina herself is meant to be a revolutionary figure. In this passage, the narrator seems bent on inducing us to share a mode of percep tion that centers the historical world on Tina: In that summer, we know, the great nation of France was agitated by con flicting thoughts and passions, which were but the beginning of sorrows. And in our Caterina's little breast, too, there were terrible struggles. The poor bird was beginning to flutter and vainly dash its soft breast against the hard iron bars of the inevitable, and we see too plainly the danger, if that anguish should go on heightening instead of being allayed, that the palpitat ing heart may be fatally bruised. (147) Does the narrator's emotional engagement here suggest that she is edging toward story space, placing herself (as the critics of "The Killers" we've discussed might have put it) at Tina's side in the world of the fiction? This critic is tempted to answer the question in the affirmative, as a way of condoning the passage's pur plicity. In a second passage, no such question can arise. This passage functions metonymically, to place Tina's sufferings in a determinate relationship to history and indeed to the universe itself, and thereby to contain their significance within reasonable bounds. While this poor little heart was being bruised with a weight too heavy for it, Nature was holding on her calm inexorable way, in unmoved and terrible beauty. The stars were rushing in their eternal courses; the tides swelled to the level of the last expectant weed; the sun was making brilliant day to busy nations on the other side of the swift earth. The stream of human thought and deed was hurrying and broadening onward. . . . What were</page><page sequence="13">Loose Narrators 107 our little Tina and her trouble in this mighty torrent, rushing from one aw ful unknown to another? (177) The narrator here, speaking from a point not simply separated from story space, but raised far above any earthly scene, is entirely capable of attending judiciously to Tina, the French Revolution, and anything else that offers itself for her in spection. In the end, metonymical containment wins out in the story, in keeping with its dominantly eighteenth-century mode. The narrator creates a decorous distance between us and Tina's fate. Tina dies, and her memory is preserved in a chamber in her husband's house, which is kept locked. This room, the narrator tells us, is "a sort of visible symbol of the secret chamber in [her husband's] heart, where he had long turned the key on early hopes and early sorrows, shutting up for ever all the passion and the poetry of his life" (130). Passion and poetry flourish in the third and final story of Scenes of Clerical Life, "Janet's Repentance," which is set closer to Eliot's present. In "Janet's Re pentance," another locked chamber appears. The story's hero, Edgar Tryan, has his own secret chamber of the heart, which locks away the pathetic story of a girl he had seduced and abandoned. Unlike Tina's husband, however, he freely opens his chamber, revealing his secret story when doing so will promote Janet's salva tion. "He hesitated" the narrator tells us, "as we tremble to let in the daylight on a chamber of relics which we have never visited except in curtained silence. But ... he went on" (358). By "going on," Mr. Tryan abandons the pictorial containment Eliot associates with eighteenth-century society, so that a new ethos? the well-known ethic of sympathy Eliot finds proper for the nineteenth century? can assert itself. This ethic, as the image of Tryan's opening up the secret chamber of his heart suggests, involves the breaking down of barriers. One of those barri ers separates story space from discourse space. Signs that the narrator is taking a historically limited, even partisan position abound in "Janet's Repentance." In one remarkable sequence, the narrator com pares different ways of understanding a clergyman like Mr. Tryan. In one para graph, she gives a gloss from above: '"One of the Evangelical clergy, a disciple of Venn,' says the critic from his bird's-eye station. 'Not a remarkable specimen; the anatomy and habits of his species have been determined long ago.'" This cold summary is quickly corrected by a view from quite a different vantage point: Yet surely, surely the only true knowledge of our fellow-man is that which enables us to feel with him?which gives us a fine ear for the heart-pulses that are beating under the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion. Our subtlest analysis of schools and sects must miss the essential truth, unless it be lit up by the love that sees in all forms of human thought and work, the life and death struggles of separate human beings. (322) It would be possible to interpret this fervent passage as simply one more com ment made by a not-necessarily-human narrator, securely placed on one side of</page><page sequence="14">108 Harry E. Shaw the glass wall that separates the space of narration from the space of story. No doubt a narrator insulated from story space could voice these sentiments, or any others. But taking the passage this way misses most of its affective charge, and all of its historical impetus.9 What matters most here is not the doctrine this para graph voices, but its mode of asserting that doctrine, a mode that is self-consciously and unapologetically emotional, willful, and partial. The passage is dramatic, and it begs to be dramatized. As a reader, I cannot react with cool aloofness to such an appeal; I must join hands with the narrator and with Tryan himself. The reader of Scenes of Clerical Life knows very well that its narrator excels at the bird's-eye view. At the very moment when she castigates those who would "with the bird's-eye glance of a critic" presume to condemn Tryan's doctrinal narrowness, she specifies precisely wherein that narrowness lay, drawing her own precise knowledge clearly enough from a position "above" the historical stream. "A critic might perhaps say that he made the mistake of identifying Christianity with a too narrow doctrinal system; that he saw God's work too exclusively in an antagonism to the world, the flesh, and the devil; that his intellectual culture was too limited?and so on" (322). Yet the very thoroughness of the narrator's knowl edge from "above" calls for strong countermeasures. Mere intellectual correction will not suffice. In voicing her energetic denunciation of the bird's-eye view, the narrator seeks to bind herself to the limited view of one involved in the throes of history in the making, not one observing history already made. She seeks to im merse herself willfully in the very historical stream men like Tryan and women like Janet have helped to propel along its way?which, indeed, is the same stream in which Eliot as a writer of the present finds herself immersed. "But I am not poised at that lofty height," she declares. "I am on the level and in the press with him, as he struggles his way along the stony road, through the crowd of unloving fellow-men" (322). If this passage has engaged us as it means to, we will realize that in the narrator's description of Tryan's funeral at the end of the story, she not only implores us as readers to join the funeral procession that marches be hind his coffin, she joins it herself. To be sure, such moments can't last?the bird's eye view is bound to reassert itself?but it's the impulse to break down barriers that's interesting here, the impulse for the narrative voice to claim a place in history. This impulse seems inevitable in a wise historicist, whether en gaged in creating fictional or critical narratives. In the last sentence of Erich Auerbach's "Epilegomena zu Mimesis," after Auerbach has defended at length the accuracy of his philology in Mimesis and has outlined his methods and goals in a way that makes them seem timeless in their scope and wisdom, he adds, simply and without apology, that ''Mimesis is a book that is entirely aware that it was written by a particular man, with a particular past, living at a particular place at the beginning of the 1940's."10 As the narrator of Scenes of Clerical Life moves from "Gilfil" to "Janet's Repentance," we see her giving up a position that allows her the imaginative freedom to create a detached imitation of the past, in exchange for the moral force that stems from our amazement that such an im mensely intelligent and perspicuous intellectual presence is willing to submit to the creatural limits of a given time and place.</page><page sequence="15">Loose Narrators 109 In her later fiction, Eliot is less likely simply to announce that she is there in the press with her characters. Yet there are signs of a wish to join them nonethe less. We feel the narrator edging toward story space, and thus toward a determi nate place in history, in moments of desire?moments critics have sometimes deplored as embodying a simple loss of control or failure to maintain distance. Such a dynamic informs the scenes between Dorothea and Will Ladislaw at the end of Middlemarch. It also informs the "Jewish half" of Daniel Deronda. When Daniel Deronda sees the images of his, and the narrator's, and the reader's desire come to life as he rows on the Thames and looks across at the shore or up at a bridge, we discover that he, and the narrator, and we as readers, are all negotiat ing the same historical stream. A similar dynamic is at work in the novel's other plot. To trace its presence, I shall turn to an authorial intervention that parallels the interventions we've no ticed in "Gilfil." This passage is well known to critics of Deronda; in it Eliot views the situation of her heroine in the context, not of the French Revolution, but of the American Civil War: Could there be a slenderer, more insignificant thread in human history than this consciousness of a girl, busy with her small inferences of the way in which she could make her life pleasant??in a time, too, when ideas were with fresh vigour making armies of themselves, and the universal kinship was declaring itself fiercely: when women on the other side of the world would not mourn for the husbands and sons who died bravely in a common cause, and men stinted of bread on our side of the world heard of that will ing loss and were patient: a time when the soul of man was waking to pulses which had for centuries been beating in him unheard, until their full sum made a new life of terror or of joy. What in the midst of that mighty drama are girls and their blind visions? They are the Yea or Nay of that good for which men are enduring and fighting. In these delicate vessels is borne onward through the ages the trea sure of human affections. (159-60) Though this passage shares the fervor of the narrative interventions we've noted in Scenes, the way in which it blurs narrative boundaries is more complex than theirs. We don't find the narrator here announcing that she is there with Gwen dolen, a delicate vessel herself. What the passage does contain is a notable mix ing of voices and viewpoints. On the one hand, the narrator speaks with Olympian detachment about the importance of "girls and their blind visions." On the other hand, if we try to apply these pronouncements to Gwendolen, we hear the narra tive voice shift from a mode of detachment to one of hope and desire, a mode that seems more appropriate for a character than an extradiegetic narrator. The narra tor insists on her status as narrator, judging and disposing of characters and events, at the very time when she seems full of the sort of earnest, open-ended de sire to make sense of the historical stream we might expect a character to feel. There may be worse ways of attempting to describe this remarkable bifurcation</page><page sequence="16">110 Harry E.Shaw than to suggest that the narrator seems, at crucial moments in Daniel Deronda, to enter story space, or evinces a strong impulse to attempt such an entry. On the face of it, one could hardly imagine a narrator more securely re moved from the world of the characters than this one is, with her talk about Gwendolyn's "small inferences," her comprehensive view of the larger historical context, and her confident pronouncement of how "small" characters and large historical moments are nonetheless to be related. (Her confident ease extends as tonishingly far: "ideas" are magisterially depicted as "with fresh vigour making armies of themselves"?as if the only question that might arise concerning the re lationship between an idea and an army involved the degree of "vigour" with which the one could transform itself into the other!) There is, however, a remark able gap between the certainty with which the narrator defends the importance of the inner dramas of "girls," and the bemusement we feel as we try to see Gwendolen in this light. The point of the passage would seem to be that, ap pearances to the contrary notwithstanding, Gwendolyn's inner life is significant. Visions of Civil War heroism may seem to make her concerns unspeakably triv ial; in fact, though, she and other girls like her turn out to embody the point of that heroism, the reason why strife and suffering are justified. Yet when we think of Gwendolen concretely, this noble justification seems to evaporate. "Girls" may be the "delicate vessels" in which "human affections" are borne; but Gwendolyn's "human affections" seem at best embryonic at this point in the novel. (Selfishness and primitive fear she possesses in abundance.) Thus we find ourselves back where we were when the passage began, wondering why Gwendolen, of all girls, is worthy of so much scrutiny. To be sure, Gwendolen as an empty vessel might be intended to demonstrate the bankruptcy of English society: if ideas made ar mies to arise around her, they would be making a mistake. But such a reading fails to account for the positive aura that hovers around the "girls" in the pas sage. We can account for that aura if we speak in terms, not of what Gwendolyn's "blind visions" represent at the moment, but of what they might and should represent?if we think of potentiality, not actuality; of the future, not the pres ent; of the optative, not the indicative. But then we begin to hear in the narra tor's voice, not only Olympian certainty with respect to the worth of "girls" in general, but hope and wishfulness with respect to Gwendolen. When we pursue the "frail vessels" passage, then, we begin to hear the narrator speaking with two voices?one that generalizes from a vantage point securely removed from story space, and another that desires and hopes, in the teeth of present evidence, as a character in story space might do. The first scene in Daniel Deronda depicts a character who feels drawn to read the riddle Gwendolyn's beautiful surface presents. "Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance? Was the good or the evil genius dominant in those beams?" The novel opens with these words, and in its course Deronda comes to hope with some fervor that Gwendolen will achieve deep human significance, instead of remaining part of the decorative, random meaninglessness epitomized by the</page><page sequence="17">Loose Narrators 111 roulette table over which he first observes her. Appropriately enough, the open ing sentences of the novel enact a confusion of speaker's and narrator's perspec tives: for nearly a page, it's impossible to tell whether the figure who is observing Gwendolen and asking these questions will turn out to be the narrator, or an as yet unnamed character, or some mixture of the two. In the chapter that ends with the "frail vessels" passage, there occurs another moment when the perspectives of the narrator and of one of the characters mix. The narrator comes to speak of Gwendolyn's "small inferences of the way in which she could make her life pleasant" after having presenting Gwendolyn's powers of small inference busily at work as she talks with Grandcourt, in a series of literally parenthetical mental remarks made during the pauses he leaves before he responds to Gwendolyn's repartee: "I suppose you are a first-rate shot with a rifle." (Pause, during which Gwendolen, having taken a rapid observation of Grandcourt, made a brief graphic description of him to an indefinite hearer.) "I have left off shooting." "Oh, then, you are formidable person. People who have done things once and left them off make one feel very contemptible, as if one were using cast off fashions. I hope you have not left off all follies, because I practice a great many." (Pause, during which Gwendolen made several interpretations of her own speech.) (146) These parenthetical thoughts continue for two more pages, and include among other things the report that in one pause, Gwendolen "was thinking that men had been known to choose some one else than the woman they most admired, and recalled several experiences of that kind in novels" (148). Should we have failed to appreciate the arch peculiarity of this mode of narration, the narrator adds, at the end of the sequence, the following observation: "How Grandcourt had filled up the pauses will be more evident hereafter" (148). Here we see a character who seems to want to act as a narrator?indeed we find Gwendolen narrating different versions of the scene as she experiences it?while the narrator observes her with great detachment, through the glass wall of impersonal author ial irony. Yet at this moment where the narrator's detachment from the depicted world appears complete, authorial intervention unexpectedly takes the following form, attaching itself to a bit of free indirect discourse rendering Gwendolyn's reaction to the fact that Miss Juliet Fenn has beaten her at archery: It was impossible to be jealous of Juliet Fenn, a girl as middling as mid-day market in everything but her archery and her plainness, in which last she was noticeably like her father: underhung and with receding brow resem bling that of the more intelligent fishes. (Surely, considering the importance which is given to such an accident in female offspring, marriageable men, or</page><page sequence="18">112 Harry E.Shaw what the new English calls "intending bridegrooms," should look at them selves dispassionately in the glass, since their natural selection of a mate prettier than themselves is not certain to bar the effect of their own ugli ness.) (148-49) Here the disengaged narrator suddenly imitates Gwendolyn's own way of "filling in the gaps"?the more unmistakably, in that we might for a line or so mistak enly suppose that the parenthetical commentary represents Gwendolyn's own thoughts! Is the narrator at such a remove from the scene that she can play tricks with the forms she has created, or has the narrator suddenly (and for the moment inexplicably) entered the fictional world? Why should the narrator mimic Gwendolen here, to be sure in a different key? If the purpose is to raise the pos sibility that movements can occur between narrative world and story world, whether this moment itself embodies such a shift hardly matters. What does mat ter is that we may subsequently be more inclined to recognize in the "delicate vessels" passage an expression of the narrator's desire, the kind of desire all of us, whether in fictional histories or in the world of history, must share, as events unfold, promising and threatening. The historicized narrator would seem to merge here with a "desiring narrator." How better to dramatize desire than by drawing on the resources of story space? To explain why nineteenth-century realist novelists might well wish to breach the wall between their narrators and their characters, I have appealed to the general cultural and intellectual situation in which they and their audiences found themselves. My suggestion has been that realist novels incorporating a conscien tious historicism could hardly exempt the narrator from its consequences. In fic tion where the characters are elaborately represented as subject to history, one method of historicizing the narrator in an affectively powerful way was to create a certain amount of fluidity between discourse space and story space. I'd like to close my discussion by placing this mode of creating a historicized narrator in a narratological frame. To do so, I shall return to an objection to Genette's work I mentioned briefly at the outset of this essay. Chatman complains that in certain of his comments on "focalization," Genette weakens in his resolve to keep "see ing" and "speaking" strictly separate, by seeming to set "first-person" narrators loose in story space. What interests me here, quite apart from the rights and wrongs of the matter at hand, is that in discussing this problem Genette produces a model that, if generalized and extended, can account for other loose narrators as well. Genette runs counter to his own best instincts, Chatman suggest, when in Narrative Discourse he suggests that "the only focalization logically implied by the 'first-person' narrator is focalization through the narrator" (Chatman 145). This is a criticism Genette himself had both articulated and explored in Narra tive Discourse Revisited, where he calls the locution in question "fairly heterodox with respect to my own definitions" (77). For Genette, focalization involves the flow of information. A narrative has a "focus" that "coincides with a character" when the information the reader receives is restricted to the information that</page><page sequence="19">Loose Narrators 113 character could be expected to possess (74). But the narrator isn't a character; he's the one who effects the focalization, the one who chooses where the "focus" will be. It would therefore seem odd to suggest that a narrative could be focal ized through a narrator; we'd normally say that the narrative was focalized by the narrator. Why does Genette nonetheless use this odd locution, and how much of a problem does it actually present? The notion that "first-person" (or "homodiegetic") fiction is "focalized through the narrator" ought to present a significant problem, but in practice, it doesn't. It ought to present a problem, because in homodiegetic works the narrator-as narrator knows more than the narrator-as-character. In particular, the narrator knows what he has learned since the time when the story he's relating took place. Pip the man narrating knows more than Pip the boy experiencing the story.11 But since characters are the ones who serve as the narrative focuses for texts, talk of focalization "through the narrator" would seem to suggest that the infor mation we're given must be restricted to the information the naimtor-as-character possessed?which in Great Expectations is hardly the case. In practice, Genette argues, this problem doesn't arise, because norms of interpretation existing beyond the realm of prose fiction prevent us from drawing the wrong conclusions (77-78). Our strong sense of what to expect from nonfictional autobiographies supervenes, telling us that if we speak of "focalization through the narrator," we must mean "focalization through the narrator who is looking back on the story," because that's the way autobiographies are always told. Strictly speaking, it might be more prudent to say that the homodiegetic narrator "focalizes the story through himself as retrospective narrator," or something of the sort, but in practice it's not necessary to do so. Genette gives us no reason to hope that generic norms from other realms of discourse will supervene to correct our terminological ambiguities when we dis cuss other kinds of fiction. For Genette, the situation of homodiegetic narration is peculiar: "Homodiegetic narration, by nature or convention (in this case, they amount to the same thing), simulates autobiography much more closely than heterodiegetic narration ordinarily simulates historical narrative" (77). It may be, however, that the model Genette offers to mitigate his partial lapse from self orthodoxy, a model in which the force of general narratological concepts under goes modification when they are placed in subordination to broader cultural pre suppositions, has a more general applicability than he suggests?especially if we introduce the possibility that other kinds of narrative may also feel constrained to "simulate" general cultural norms. We might have supposed that the laws nar ratology discovers, because of their greater abstractness and generality, would "trump" the other forces at work in shaping texts, but such apparently is not al ways the case. Genette suggests that the situation of the first-person narrator is exceptional in a way that makes it non-threatening to the general distinction between seeing and speaking. He does this by claiming that the heterodiegetic narrators are free to invent and package the "information" of the stories they tell in absolutely any way they choose: "In fiction, the heterodiegetic narrator is not accountable for</page><page sequence="20">114 Harry E Shaw his information, 'omniscience' forms part of his contract, and his motto might be this retort by a character of Pr?vert's: 'What I don't know, I guess, and what I don't guess, I make up'" (77-78). But is any narrator's freedom quite so complete as this? Narrators might have the freedom to make up pieces of information. Do they have the freedom to make up the form that the information takes? Surely generic and cultural forces set limits. Could the most resolutely "omniscient" nar rator of a realist novel suggest that one of the characters could defy gravity, or that the hero's cat was really a mechanical spy from Mars, without violating ge neric constraints at least as coercive and as pre-given as those of autobiography are for "first-person" narrations? Genette's quotation from Pr?vert is apt: in some situations, to maintain in a pure state such narratological categories as "seeing" and "speaking," a narrator would indeed need to possess the power to create from beginning to end the sense of probability informing the imagined world of the story. For fiction that seeks to mesh its probabilities with those of a reality it considers prior to itself, the line between seeing and speaking (and other lines as well) will be more difficult to maintain. But this is the situation of nineteenth century realism. In nineteenth-century realism, both heterodiegetic and homo diegetic modes of narration feel constrained to "simulate" the conditions of histor ical possibility operating in the real world. The ways in which I have been speaking about narration in this essay are no doubt imprecise if measured against the standards of some versions of narratol ogy. They also allow one to begin to describe how certain kinds of affect move in texts and move readers, and to account for some of the complexities that arise when historical and textual worlds interact. These matters are hard to describe and discuss; to bring them into anything approaching focus would appear to re quire at times a loose and flexible metaphoricity in our use of terms and con cepts.12 I'd hazard the guess that narratology in the future will expand its at tempts to deal with the affective and historical material Chatman's distinctions may inadvertently obscure, while at the same time attempting to maintain, as much as each case allows, the clarity and specificity that characterize Chatman's work at its enviable best. ENDNOTES 1. Here, omitting only Genette's citation of Cohn's article, is his endorsement: "Il convient, dit justement Dorrit Cohn, de 'mettre un terme ? l'habitude n?gligente (sloppy) qui consiste ? qual ifier les protagonistes de romans ? focalisation interne, comme Stephen, Samsa ou Strether, de 'narrateurs' de leur histoire'" (43 n.l). 2. This is an interesting metaphor: discourse space or some agent within it itself "sees" the only area in which narrative "seeing" can properly take place. The insistently visual language here is some thing that Genette has distanced himself from: the question he now asks is "Who perceives?" or even better, "Where is the focus of perception?" (64). Metaphors like "story space" and "narrative space" are handy but (like all other metaphors) limited. I make use of them throughout this essay, though moments when the narrator seems to blend with the characters might sometimes be bet ter described by using the metaphor of a mixture of voices. 3. Must I really write a footnote defending the use of the expression "real life"? Well, I have written (part of) one.</page><page sequence="21">Loose Narrators 115 4. The account IVe given here of the novel's function could easily open out into very broad vistas indeed. For a brilliant example of how such vistas can arise from the concrete analysis of literary form, see Rader. 5. It's only fair to note that Chatman mentions in passing a situation in which the camera as narra tor behaves "as if it were a character. The opening of Hitchcock's Rear Window, he tells us, leaves the viewer uncertain about whether what appears on the screen is meant to be taken as what a character is seeing (45). This is directly parallel to the uncertainty introduced in the open ing paragraphs of Daniel Deronda, mentioned below. 6. My interpolations are intended to make the sense of the passage clear in the present context; in doing so, they mask one of its subtleties. As Forster actually wrote it, the passage employs free indirect discourse ("She loved Cecil; George made her nervous"), which adds another level of irony to its workings, since one of the functions of free indirect discourse is to finesse the prob lems involved in having narrators tell things to characters and readers. 7. In passing, Lanser suggests that certain moments of subdued commentary on the part of Heming way's narrator create "a more intimate relationship with the textual narratee than one usually finds in a story where the narrator is entirely covert and apparently 'invisible'" (269). This notion is compatible with my own analysis, though admittedly its stress on the importance of the posi tioning of the reader is considerably less insistent than mine. 8. Critics of ideology have seen in this asymmetry between narrator and characters a prime means by which realist fiction reinforces the norms of bourgeois ideology. The narrator assumes a posi tion from which he can dictate the terms of reality, and where his exemption from the laws of the world he creates is seen, not as an act of unexplained privilege, but as something that makes his creation all the more real! David Lodge sums up the general line such criticism takes as follows: "Post-structuralist criticism, especially that which derives from the work of Roland Barthes, has identified the 'classic realist text' as an instrument of ideology, a genre founded on bad faith, on the pretense that bourgeois culture is 'natural,' using the dominance of the authorial voice over all other discourses in the text to limit meaning in the interest of control, repression and privilege" (121-22). 9. The vehemence of the insistence here that we are all alike under the "mere clothes" provided by our moment in history stems precisely from the depth of Eliot's knowledge of the coercive power of our historical milieu, and the need she feels to find an even more powerful force to oppose it. The issue as Eliot raises it cannot become an issue except in a historicist framework. 10. Auerbach would probably have been nonplused by the notion that his book was aware of any thing; my translation attempts to capture the force of his "ganz bewu?t." Here is the original: "Mimesis ist ganz bewu?t ein Buch, das ein bestimmter Mensch, in einer bestimmten Lage, zu Anfang der 1940er Jahre geschrieben hat" (18). 11. The classic discussion of this distinction is Dorrit Cohn's analysis, in Transparent Minds 143-72, of the "experiencing self" and the "narrating self." 12. Compare Genette, in the midst of his discussion of focalization: "Here as elsewhere, the choice is purely operational. This looseness will undoubtedly shock some people, but I see no reason for requiring narratology to become a catechism with a yes-or-no answer to check off for each ques tion, when often the proper answer would be that it depends on the day, the context, and the way the wind is blowing" (74).
