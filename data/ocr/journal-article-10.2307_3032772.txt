The IUAES was established 23 August 1948 when it was brought into one organization with the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, which was founded in 1934. The IUAES organizes a World Congress every 5 years, and has lately been organizing 'Inter-Congresses'. The XIIth World Congress will be held in Zagreb in 1988 under the presidency of Professor Hubert Maver, and the next Inter-Congress is planned for Egypt in January 1986. The Union comprizes approximately 150 individual members chosen from national and institutional organizations in some 56 countries. Each country is represented by no more than 6 individuals, chosen by anthropologists in that country. As of July 1984 there are 12 Commissions active, which are the principal agents of the IUAES's research: Commission on Documentation, Commission on Anthropology of Women, Commission on Museums and Cultural Heritage, Commission on Folk Law and Legal Pluralism, Commission on Urgent Anthropological Research, Commission on Food and Food Problems, Commission for the Anthropological and Bthnological Study of Peace, Commission on Challenges of Development, Commission on Nomadic Peoples, Commission on Futurology, Commission on Urban Anthropology, and Commission in Visual Anthropology. Most of these Commissions produce newsletters and publish books. Membership for institutions is US$25 (first time) or $25 (renewal), and for individuals $10.

Peace and War: Cross-Cultural Perspectives in Summer 1985. Contains revised versions of many papers presented at the 1983 1 Ith IUAES Congress. The December 1984 Newsletter of the Commission contains a course outline on Culture and Nuclear War, which 'explores the problem of war and aggression within a perspective of the evolution of culture' and the 'semiotics of nuclear war', meaning 'an analysis of the cultural representations (novels, films, music) through which the possibility of nuclear war is apprehended'. It is developed by Greg Urban, University of Texas. The Newsletter also contains an article entitled The Nicaraguan Problem: Peace and Paranoia, 1984 in which it is stated that the US rearmament campaign against Nicaragua is based on the American claim that an arms smuggle is taking place from Nicaragua to El Salvador, a claim which appears to be without clear evidence. A U.S. Diplomat is report&gt;: to have referred to the arms smuggle as taking place in a fonseca, which is in fact (according to the article) an 'ethnographically extinct' canoe. 27</page><page sequence="2">The Museum of Mankind has opened the new exhibition Inuit/Eskimo: People of the North American Arctic. 'Inuit' in Inuit language means 'the people', while 'Eskimo' is a name ascribed to the Inuit by their sub Arctic neighbours, meaning 'eaters of raw meat'. As pointed out by the literature on the exhibition: 'the Inuit no more entirely lived on raw food than he French do on frogs' legs'. Hence, 'Eskimo' is a pejorative term for the Inuit. The Inuit live along four thousand miles of coast between Bering Strait and Greenland, and this exhibition provides a brief outline of Inuit material culture at the time of European contact, illustrating the technical brilliance and aesthetic sophistication of the equipment and clothing used in the most hostile of climates, the Arctic. The exhibition includes an exceptional series of wood and ivory snow goggles carved to reduce glare and prevent snow blindness. Most of the material in the exhibition were collected during the 19th century European search of the North West passage to the East. A comprehensive Exhibition Handlist is available. Also available are teachers notes and worksheets for late junior/middle age ranges, including The Eskimos Activity Book (?1.20 inc. p&amp;p), which includes quizzes, games drawing and colouring projects for 7 to 11 year olds. Screenings of films and videos covering a wide range of traditional and contemporary Inuit activities can be arranged. The opening exhibition coincided with a BBC TV children's series Eskimos, screened in the BBC TV Zig- Zag programmes early 1985. Contact: Museum of Mankind, Burlington Gardens, London WI, tel. 636 1555. The World Archaeological Congress will be held between 1-7 September 1986 in Southampton and London.

Queen Elizabeth House is in its third year of a refugee studies programme. The last series of seminars completed, entitled The Crisis of Mass Exodus, paid particular attention to Southern Sudan, Indo-China, Somalia and Thailand. The Programme in particular 'aims to be a resource for poorer nations .. to strengthen their capacity to cope with the dramatic population movements'. An important feature of the programme is the inclusion of refugees themselves in the discussion of refugee problematics, and in the March 1984 symposium, entitled 'Assistance to Refugees: Alternative View- points', no less than eighteen refugees 'who came directly from camps in Africa' participated. Currently running is the Visiting Study Fellow programme for those wishing to undertake supervised study of refugee issues. The programme also aims to produce a collection of papers on European refugees in the twentieth century, for which a workshop has been planned in July 1985. Contact: B.E. Harrell-Bond, Programme Co- ordinator, Queen Elizabeth House, 21 St. Giles, Oxford. First Kaberry Lecture. A new series of commemorative lectures in honour of Phyllis Kaberry, Barbara Ward and Audrey Richards has been founded by the Centre for Cross-cultural Research on Women at Queen Elizabeth House in Oxford. The first such lecture in memory of Phyllis Kaberry was given by Dr. Caroline Ifeka, of the Australian National University, in the Taylor Institute, Oxford, on 14 November 1984. The lecture was entitled 'Can the Leopard Change its Spots?: the mystical and political powers of queen mothers and kings', and concerned forms of female and male power in West Africa, particularly the Cameroons (the site of Dr. Kaberry's research) and Nigeria (where Dr. Ifeka has worked). The next lecture will take place in the summer term, and will be given by Professor Jean La Fontaine in memory of Audrey Richards. Survival International News (No.6 1984) contains details of violations of minorities in West Papua, Australia, Guyana, India, Solomon Islands, Tibet, Bangladesh, and numerous South American countries. A leading article on West Papua (Irian Jaya) draws attention to the plight of 'the approximately one million tribal people of the area who are suffering severe exploitation and the loss of their ancestral lands to development projects'. With the planned introduction of 200,000 families over the next 5 years, West Papua is being 'Indonesianized .. by colonizing their lands with more loyal subjects brought from the over-populated central islands ... making the Papuans a 28</page><page sequence="3">minority in their own lands'. This 'receives massive funding from international agencies including the World Bank'. Papua New Guinea, under pressure of the Indonesian government, is preparing to repatriate West Papuan refugees to West Papua. The safety of these refugees cannot be guaranteed, as in the course of this year as many as 500 corpses have been found of presumed refugees, many of whom were - according to some sources - gunned down by Indonesian patrol boats.

Thanks to Sean Conlin for drawing our attention to the positive review in the Times of India (Nov. 25) on Akbar Ahmed and David Hart's book on Islam in Tribal Societies: From the Atlas to the Indus. Conlin draws attention in particular to the positive note of the review, not altogether expected from an Indian newspaper on a topic as sensitive in India as the Muslem religion. The review concludes that 'instead of seeking an intellectual consensus for its own sake, the editors have let the individual authors come to their own conclusions ... they deserve all the praise from scholars and intelligent readers for bringing together some of the finest pieces of scholarship on Islamic tribes under one cover'. The Horniman Museum has reopened fully after a face-lift. There are two major new displays in the main galleries - on the traditional culture of Ethiopia and new acquisitions from the Cross River area of Nigeria. The new Cross River Exhibition breaks new ground in displaying items commissioned in the course of the 1983/84 Horniman Expedition, side by side with earlier pieces from the same area in the museum collection. A notable feature of this exhibition is the extent to which pieces are placed in cultural context using the results of new ethnographic data collected by the Keeper of Ethnography. The central exhibit is the funerary shrine for an Annang elder, while other items include carved wooden masks and figures, including portraits of Prince Charles and Diana in wedding costume, by the Annang sculptor Akpan Akpan Chukwu. Information will be also be conveyed about the photographic and video equipment used in the course of ethnographic fieldwork. Old favourites will be back on show - the updated Egyptian display and its mummies, the Apostle Clock, and a temporary study series on the theme 'Fish and Ships' (South Hall balcony). The Special Exhibition Programme includes The Last of the Bedouin in Jordan (1 March-14 May 1985). A Bedouin tent is the centre-piece. Accompanied by audio-visual presentation and a photographic display. Illustrated catalogue available. Contact: Horniman Museum, London Road, Forest Hill, London SE23 (tel 01-699 2339). Opening hours: weekdays 10.30-18.00, Sun 14-18. The Minority Rights Group published a report on Uganda and Sudan (no. 66). It has comprehensive bibliographical references to the area. Available from MRG at ?1.80/US$3.95 (plus 20Wo p &amp; p) at 29 Craven Street, London, WC2N 5NG.
