<plain_text><page sequence="1">'DAS GELD IST NICHT DER GRAL': CHRISTOPH HEIN AND THE WENDE This article sets out to examine the issue of Christoph Hein's contribution to the process of de-Stalinization in the GDR during and after October 1989.1 There have been articles on this topic, notably by Frauke Meyer-Gosau2 and Eckhard Thiele.3 But neither of these is objective. While Meyer-Gosau is keen to present Hein's contribution in as uncompromised a light as possible, Thiele denies that Hein made any contribution in this direction at all, presenting his role more as Stalinistic than as anti-Stalinistic. There is a need for an attempt at a more balanced picture. De-Stalinization can best be defined as the process of identifying, confronting, and overcoming the repressive mechanisms inherent in Stalinism. A corollary of this process is the evolution of democratic forms to replace these structures. It is my contention that Hein made a conscious and determined commitment to this process as I have defined it. This can best be proved by an outline of his political activity after the Wende, starting with and taking into particular account his committee work, previously neglected in assessments of his role. Following this outline, however, I argue that while calling for de-Stalinization, he showed a remarkable sympathy towards precisely those organs primarily responsible for maintaining Stalinist structures in the GDR. And his strong anti-capitalism prompts reactions which, characterized as they are by a prohibitive spirit, can themselves fairly be termed Stalinist. In the final part of the article, I argue that Hein was in another way responsible for the perpetuation of Stalinist tendencies. It was a feature of the GDR that before the Wende the SED largely refused to recognize a need for de- Stalinization. The official dogma was that the history of socialism was one of unblemished human progress, no attempt being made to admit to the Stalinist purges in either the Soviet Union or the GDR. This tendency to regard the past through rose-tinted glasses was something Hein strongly criticized in his speech 'Die ffinfte Grundrechenart' of 14 September 1989 (KS, pp. I45-56). Yet after it had become clear in late I989 and above all in I990 that East Germans wanted capitalism, not reform socialism, he formulated an interpretation of socialist history which was also very tendentious. In an argument which seemed to contradict recent 1 For ease of reference, the titles of the five books from which many of the quotations in this article are taken are given in the text in abbreviated form.

Moreover, he denied any connection, in terms of causality or historical fate, between socialism and Stalinism, and even to an extent argued the case for a milder assessment of Stalinism. On 7 and 8 October 1989, at the same time as the GDR was celebrating its fortieth anniversary in the presence of Gorbachev, thousands of demonstrators in Berlin protested against the status quo with calls of'Gorbi hilf', 'Wir sind das Volk', and 'Keine Gewalt'. Although the demonstrations were largely peaceful, the security forces, composed of Volkspolizei and members of the Ministerium fur Staatssicherheit (henceforth MfS), quelled them brutally and arrested hundreds of people. One of Christoph Hein's first reactions to these events, in addition to calling for political and social reforms and the establishment of a truly democratic socialism, was to demand the setting up of an independent committee to investigate this brutality and establish exactly who was responsible. He was not the only writer to do this. Christa Wolf, for instance, whose daughter was arrested during the demonstra- tions, also insisted on the need for an inquiry. In anticipation of a future investiga- tion, Hein invited victims to his home and informed himself about what had happened. Together with church representatives, he helped to take down state- ments and gather evidence of maltreatment by the security forces. He even financially supported this undertaking with the proceeds from public readings. The investigative committee was at last set up in mid-November 1989; both Hein and Wolf were invited to participate and accepted. The 'zeitweiliger Untersuchungs- ausschuB', as it was called, comprised members of the SED and block parties (CDU, LDPD) as well as intellectuals and representatives of the church and political opposition. It conducted hearings between 15 November 1989 and 14 March 1990. Although officially sanctioned by the authorities, the committee had a limited effectiveness. Unlike a court, it had no means of obliging those responsible for the security forces to attend hearings, nor to compel them to answer questions or to tell the truth (although its powers were to a degree extended by the Volkskammer on 26January 1990). Of those who did attend hearings and answer questions, few were prepared to be cooperative. The committee had to contend with deliberate obfus- cation, vagueness, and convenient lapses of memory, especially as regards the chain of power. As if this were not enough, Erich Mielke, head of the MfS, fearing no doubt that the committee might discover the extent of his involvement, tried to have it dissolved. Members of the MfS who were prepared to shed light on events were ordered by their superiors to keep silent, while journalists who reported on the committee's activities were threatened and even physically assaulted by the MfS. While the committee was ultimately able to trace back the conduct of the security forces on 7 and 8 October to orders from Mielke, the Nationaler Verteidigungsrat (henceforth VR), and even Honecker himself, much remained unclear, as a direct result of the non-cooperation and harassment. And not much could be achieved in terms of punishment of those responsible or of compensation for the victims. Hein feared that the committee was being exploited by the authorities for purposes of self-exculpation and even suggested stopping the investigation to prevent this abuse continuing (OR, p. 328). As an instrument for uncovering the top-level operative structures of Stalinism in the GDR or for encouraging self-critical confrontation with the past on the part of its leaders, the committee was not as successful as many had hoped. The committee</page><page sequence="3">690 Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' members were aware of the meagre results of their effort. But this in no way detracts from their commitment, and they did achieve as much as could be achieved under the circumstances. Moreover, in a series of statements made in late I990, most emphasized that the work of the committee had none the less been a contribution to the evolution of democratic forms. Kathe Gaede, CDU member of the committee, described it as the first round table (OR, p. 299), Christa Wolf saw it as a school of democracy,4 while Hein talked of a time of democracy beyond state and party interests (HTK, p. 73). A degree of retrospective idealization here is undeniable, an idealization triggered in some cases (including Hein's, one suspects) by dissatisfaction at the subsequent triumph of parliamentary democracy over hopes of direct democracy and at the loss of any chance of political self-determination as a result of reunification. But compared with what the situation had been, the committee was a democratic development. Never before in the GDR had the government and its security forces been made the subject of a critical inquiry; up to that point the only authority they answered to was their own. In fact it was the first time that an investigative committee of this kind had ever been set up, so that at the same time as it was conducting the first hearings the committee was busy defining its statutes and trying to have its rights recognized by the government. The composition of the committee was also a novelty in the GDR. Representatives of the ruling parties and members of the opposition, who for the first time could enjoy a modest degree of authority, learnt to work together, to communicate and share responsibility. The by-all-accounts difficult but profitable cooperation between people of different political beliefs and backgrounds was a step towards true democracy. That conservative members such as Ursula Jeske (SED) and Ernst Erdmann (LDPD) admitted to having gained an insight into the injustice practised by the state they represented and learnt tolerance and respect of others is a measure of the success of this cooperation (OR, pp. 297, 313)- Hartmut Peters, 'unabhangiger Burger' on the committee, saw Hein, Wolf, and Heinrich Fink as the committee members 'mit Ausstrahlung' (OR, p. 303). Cer- tainly Hein, in the face of the resistance of the authorities, did not hesitate to use the moral authority he possessed to attempt to overcome this obstruction. Three examples will illustrate this. At the end of the first hearing on 15 November 1989, he indignantly dismissed the testimony of Generalmajor Hihnel of the MfS (Hahnel had accused the demonstrators of provocation) as being but a justification for the brutality of the security forces (OR, pp. 75-76). Given that the SED and MfS were still in power (if not exactly in control), Hein's emphatic rebuke could be seen as an act of some courage. His reaction paved the way for later hearings, where members became increasingly outspoken and vehement in their anger at the non-cooperative response of those questioned. On 29 November 1989, Hein issued a statement to the press in which he complained of this non-cooperation and criticized the VR for refusing to send anyone to attend hearings (OR, p. 328). The statement was not without effect. The next hearing was attended by General Streletz, deputy minister of the VR, whose statements helped to an extent at least to reveal the degree of 4 Christa Wolf, 'Nachtrag zu einem Herbst', in Christa Wolfim Dialog (Frankfurt a.M.: Luchterhand, 990), p. I5.</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM NIVEN high-level responsibility for the brutal response to events on 7 and 8 October. After the committee had completed its work on 27 April I990, Hein tried to have an independent 'Biirgerbeauftragter' appointed whose task it would be to investigate future allegations of state injustice towards its citizens (OR, p. 339). Ultimately, nothing came of the proposition: it was a last attempt to inject a small measure of direct democratic control into the parliamentary democracy that was evolving, a last vestige of the 'third way' Hein and others had hoped for. Hein's work for the committee was an attempt to encourage a process of self-critical reflection within the upper echelons of the SED and MfS. In public speeches and interviews held between October and December, he insisted however on the need for all individuals and groups throughout society to engage on such a reflection. He may have cited above all the police, the state security forces, and the state lawyers, but in an interview of 2-3 December with Neues Deutschland, he made it clear that he believed responsibility for Stalinism to be a collective one (KS, p. 204). He hoped that every individual would confront his or her past openly and honestly, resulting in a kind of nationwide spiritual glasnost. Only then, via feelings of regret and guilt, could a true inner revolution to accompany the outer revolution be guaranteed. Indeed, it was upon this process of inner liberation that the success of a democratic future would depend. He warned against pointing the finger at others, understanding only too well the motives for such tendencies: 'Bekanntlich istja der Splitter im Auge des anderen immer ein wenig gr6oer, als der Balken im eigenen' (KS, p. 204). In this context, Hein's support of Gustav Just was another important contribu- tion to the process of de-Stalinization. Just, deputy editor of the GDR weekly Sonntag, had been sentenced to four years in prison in I957. Along with others, including Walter Janka, head of the publisher Aufbau, he had been accused and found guilty of conspiring against Ulbricht. The charges and sentences were unjust; Janka and Just, for all their commitment to reforms within socialism, were not counter-revolutionaries. In the summer of 1989, having written his own account of what had been little more than a Stalinist show-trial, Just, knowing the political climate to be still inappropriate for publication, asked Hein if he would be prepared to hide a copy of the manuscript to prevent it falling into the wrong hands. Hein agreed. According toJust, Hein claimed thatJust's account could help the process of democratic reform when the time was right (HTD, p. I90). The Wende made publication possible, and Just's account appeared under the title Zeuge in eigener Sache: Die Finfziger Jahre in der DDR in I990. On I December I989, Hein gave a speech in honour ofJust within the framework of a commemorative concert for the victims of Stalinism. In his speech, he expressed the hope thatJust's account would help people to confront the past, accept their responsibility, and overcome the spirit of Stalinism. Hein's speech was printed as the foreword toJust's book. Hein's only literary publication in the hectic last months of 1989, the short story Die Vergewaltigung which appeared on 2-3 December in Neues Deutschland, can also be seen as an encouragement to the process of Vergangenheitsbewdltigung. He actually wrote the story in I988,5 but its applicability to his own post-Wende convictions makes it a highly topical piece. In the story, the main character Ilona gives a public 5 Hein provided me with this date in a letter of I i August 1993. 69I</page><page sequence="5">692 Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' speech in which, in subconscious enslavement to the official GDR dictum that the Soviet Union is beyond criticism, she covers up the fact that her grandmother was raped by the Russians in I945; forced by her husband to recognize this dishonesty, she withdraws, hurt, angry, and tearful, to her bedroom. The end of the story shows her gradually growing calmer. The story illustrates the falsification of biographical truth, the adjustment of memory in the interests of conformism, and shows the painful but ultimately liberating effect of confronting this. Ilona's husband, while triggering the confrontation, remains sympathetic to her and refrains from beingjudgemental. Similarly, while Hein believed after October 1989 that it might be necessary to trigger Vergangenheitsbewdltigung in those not prepared to take it upon themselves (and his own public statements and committee work were meant as a push in this direction) he warned against passing the buck and against victimization. Clearly, Hein was afraid of the consequences of a process of superficial democrati- zation similar to that after I 945, when, he has repeatedly stressed, National Socialist ideas were not properly eradicated from the public consciousness in either the East or the West of Germany. It may have been naive of him to hope that the East German people might subject themselves to a radical self-examination. Certainly the call for self-scrutiny was not one which the majority of East Germans was likely to heed. The changes in the GDR in October and November 1989 generated a feeling of excitement, even euphoria in the East German population. Interest was focused on daily events, each day bringing as it did the prospect of new freedoms. In such an atmosphere there was little time and little desire for introspection. Hein's frequent warnings throughout the autumn of 1989 that euphoria alone is no guarantee of future democracy proved prophetic. The reluctance of many East Germans to accept personal responsibility for the past led to an atmosphere of embittered mutual accusation throughout I990 and subsequently, an atmosphere which certainly did not foster democracy. Hein's insistence upon the need for self-scrutiny was therefore highly relevant. However, there is evidence that he did not subject himself to this process, and that in so doing he applied two different sets of rules: one for himself and one for others. It is with surprise that the critic Frauke Meyer-Gosau remarks that Hein, whose pro-democratic role she highlights, occasionally slips into SED-style terminology in his reaction to events in the autumn of 1989 (CB, p. I79). The main example she cites is this: at the height of the Wende on 9 October 1989, the conductor Kurt Masur, among others, had appealed for the need for peaceful dialogue between demonstra- tors and the authorities. The appeal helped to prevent possible clashes between police and citizens. On 4 November 1989, on the Berlin Alexanderplatz, Hein gave a speech and, in reference to these developments, spoke of renaming Leipzig 'Helden- stadt der DDR' (KS, p. I77). Meyer-Gosau, however, defends Hein against the charge she herself levels. Hein, she writes, wanted reforms in the GDR; that he paradoxically uses 'die Etikettierungen des Alten' is because he was overcome by feeling. In time, his term 'Heldenstadt' was to pass into GDR mythology. In the entry for Leipzig in the post-unification Baedeker, a subsection entitled 'I989: Heldenstadt Leipzig' informs the reader of the events of 9 October.6 If the term now 6 BaedekersAllianz-ReiseJfihrer Deutschland Ost (Berlin, Leipzig, and Stuttgart: Baedeker, I99I), p. 396.</page><page sequence="6">WILLIAM NIVEN 693 might seem salonfdhig, at the time it struck an odd note. Meyer-Gosau's attempt to explain away this and other questionable terms in Hein's post-Wende vocabulary, such as his references to the need for 'Hygiene' in East German society, also strikes an odd note: it has an apologetic ring. If certain formulations and a tendency towards rhetorical pathos in Hein's speeches after October 1989 betray a linguistic solidarity with SED-style official jargon and oratory, there are moments where the actual content of his statements suggests that he is not so much a representative of the reform movement as an apologist of the SED and even MfS. An obvious and much-quoted example is his defence of Erich Honecker during his Alexanderplatz speech on 4 November I989. He presented Honecker as an idealist, helpless in the face of Stalinist structures. But there are other, less well-publicized examples, such as the confidence he expressed (in a Spiegel interview of 29 October) in Egon Krenz as Honecker's successor (KS, p. I59), or his sympathetic attitude towards the MfS. It seems extraordinary that Hein, who himself was victimized by the MfS on more than one occasion and who was certainly aware of its repressiveness, should refer in an interview of 4-5 November 1989 with the Berliner Zeitung to its 'gewiB nicht einfache Arbeit' and to the need for the people to regain respect for this work (KS, p. 181). The peculiar and precarious nature of Hein's stance is well demonstrated by his contradictory use of the pronoun 'wir' in a speech of 28 October I989 (KS, p. 173). One moment 'wir' is used to mean everyone, including the SED, police, and MfS; a few lines later, 'wir' has become the people only, 'sie' being used to designate the police and MfS. The inconsistency results from his wish to overcome the gap between old and new, authorities and demonstrators, a gap which, he felt, needed to be bridged if further bloodshed were to be avoided and the reform process accelerated. But his tone (witness his suggestion that the demonstrators approach the police and MfS with open arms) seems conciliatory almost to the point of an uncritical solidarity with precisely those organs needing to be reformed. This raises the question as to the relationship between him and real existing socialism in the past. Hein is usually considered, especially in West Germany, to have been an opponent of real existing socialism. There is much evidence for this, evidence which can be only summarized here. He was known for his repeated attacks on the cultural policies of the SED, above all for his criticism of censorship and the lack of any press freedom. In his works, it can be argued, themes such as the socialist betrayal of its own ideals, the failure of the GDR to admit to and confront its own past (both Stalinist and National Socialist), and the continual manipulation of individuals and abuse of individual rights in the name of socialism are a central feature. When one considers the facts of his biography, Hein's oppositional role was perhaps inevitable. Being the son of a parson, he was not allowed to attend an Oberschule in the GDR, and in 1958, when he was fourteen, he had to go to school in West Berlin. He grew up a victim of discrimination, and this continued when he became a writer. He was not popular with the authorities, and was encouraged on at least two occasions to leave (in I979 and 1985). He was harried by the MfS, and most of his publications appeared only after battles with the censor. The stage history of his plays in the GDR is also a history of constant interference by the censor. Hein, though, was prepared to make changes which satisfied the authori- ties. There is no shame in this, but it does not redound to his credit that he</page><page sequence="7">694 Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' recently asserted never to have allowed changes when there is clear evidence that, in the case of the novel Horns Ende at least, he did.7 Whatever his criticism of real existing socialism and the problems he faced there, Hein decided quite consciously to stay in the GDR. The reasons he gives for staying tend to vary between a kind of 'Lokalpatriotismus' or sense of loyalty to Branden- burg, where he lived, and the refusal to give up in the face of adversity. But, in an interview of I I-I2 March 1990 in profil, he admitted to Sigrid Loffler that he would have left had he been persecuted by the authorities as much as Giinter Kunert was (HTD, p. 43). That he was not persecuted to the extent that, say, Kunert or Reiner Kunze were may have been because he was not perceived by the authorities, despite their distrust of him, to be quite as undesirable. Certainly, beyond all criticism, there were elements in Hein's philosophy which suggest that he had something in common with the SED: a belief in the superiority of socialist culture and society over Western society and culture, supported by an aggressive, unremitting anti- capitalism. This element of solidarity could be another though unspoken reason for his decision to stay in the GDR. Hein's anti-capitalism is overlooked by critics keen to stress his oppositional role in the GDR. While he is often praised for his criticism of censorship in the GDR, in his I987 speech to the Xth Writers' Congress, little reference is made to the fact that this same speech contains a passage condemning the West which relativizes and perhaps even neutralizes this criticism (KS, p. 85). He perceives in the West an economically motivated tendency towards the international monopoly of a few publishing companies and predicts a decline in Western literary culture and in Western culture as a whole. He talks of the threat of 'Neo-Analphabetentum' (KS, p. 80). The East, he continues, is not threatened by a comparable qualitative decline and will soon be responsible for the culture neglected in the West. Marcel Reich- Ranicki was one of the few to take Hein to task for this argumentation, in a I987 critique in the FAZ.8 At the same time Reich-Ranicki wondered if Hein's anti- capitalist statements might have been a tactical manoeuvre designed to placate the SED authorities, whose cultural policies the speech rejects. This theory is disproven by a glance at a quite virulent essay by Hein on the West German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk from I983. The essay attacks only the West, condemning the New Left in West Germany for its lack of political and moral 'engagement', but also perceiving in Western culture and society generally an arbitrariness, superficiality, and modishness. In response to Sloterdijk's criticism of Marxism, Hein stresses the links between Fascism and capitalism and sees West Germany as dominated by the 'Coca-Cola-Kultur' of America.9 In his essay 'Maelzel's Chess Player Goes to Hollywood' (1987), Hein argues that monetary values are the sole criterion determining the production and sale of art in 7 In an interview recently Hein claimed: 'Ich habe die Zensur nie an meinen Schreibtisch gelassen [...]. Da muB man einfach Riickgrat haben. Es gibt keinen Text von mir, wo ich heute etwas streichen m6chte oder wo ein Satz fehlt' ('Warum ich in der DDR geblieben bin: Theater Heute-Gesprich mit dem Schriftsteller Christoph Hein', Theater Heute (April 1992), 33). The validity of this claim must be doubted. The 'Zensur in der DDR' exhibition held in the Literaturhaus Berlin in I99 showed clearly that Hein, at the instigation of the authorities, had made substantial changes to Horns Ende, which was not even his original title for the novel (Zensur in der DDR: Geschichte, Praxis und Asthetik der Behinderung von Literatur, ed. by Ernst Wichner and Herbert Wiesner (Berlin: Literaturhaus Berlin, 1991), pp. 02-04). 8 Marcel Reich-Ranicki, 'Die Angst vor dem Schriftsteller', FAZ (Feuilleton), 9 December I987. 9 'Linker Kolonialismus oder der Wille zum Feuilleton', in Christoph Hein, Schlitel oder Was solls: Sticke und Essays (Darmstadt: Luchterhand, I986), pp. 183-200.</page><page sequence="8">WILLIAM NIVEN 695 capitalism.10 While he condemns the East for politicizing the role of art as a result of bureaucratic centralism and censorship, the West is presented as guilty of triviali- zing and functionalizing art for material profit. Again and again he balances criticism of the East with a barbed criticism of the West that suggests that true cultural and moral values are in greater danger there than in the East. This is also true of his fictional works such as Horns Ende ( 985), where he explodes the official GDR myth of the 'Golden Fifties', but is careful to include the figure of the unscrupulous Bachofen, who leaves the GDR to make a career as Birgermeister in West Germany, a development suggesting that the corrupt have a better chance in the West than in the East. While Hein found real existing socialism imperfect, he did see it as in some respects a truly socialist society. This is visible in references, such as those in a 1981 speech, to the absence of certain forms of capitalist exploitation and to 'eine Gesellschaft mit sozialer Gleichheit'. l He had little doubt that the GDR was superior to the FRG, and that its superior culture had to be protected against the ever-present threat of Western contamination. He often points to areas where the GDR was drifting in what he felt to be a capitalist direction: he warns, for example, against a concentration of publishing companies in East Germany and against a creeping tendency towards trivial entertainment in the GDR's theatres (KS, pp. 85, 94-98). Hein's belief that capitalism is synonymous with cultural decadence is an ideological reflex that has little to do with the realities in the West. It may also be a psychological reflex. While he knew the GDR's socialist venture to be flawed, he still believed in it. In order to convince himself of its value and justification as an alternative to life in the West, he had to denigrate capitalism. Certainly his picture of capitalism is wholly negative and undifferentiated: he reduces it to the heartless mechanics of economic warfare. This portrayal of capitalism is not dissimilar to the portrayal in official SED propaganda. It even seems as if Hein, in conjuring up an apocalyptic vision of the cultural collapse of capitalism and stressing the cultural responsibility of the East, is himself trading SED propaganda and making his contribution to the Cold War. When he was offered and accepted the Lehrstuhlfuir Poetik at the Folkwang-Hochschule in Essen-Werden in West Germany in 1988, he used it to help the students write and stage a traditionally anti-capitalist play about war as a profit-making enterprise, specific criticism being directed at the German firm Krupp. Reading the text, which Hein did not personally write but whose conception and development he certainly influenced, one can only imagine that the GDR authorities would have been happy with this attack on the capitalist foe, and that within the enemy's own territory.12 His apparent sympathy towards the long-standing GDR authorities after October 1989 is undoubtedly in large part the result of his feeling that whatever differences might divide them, they were united by a commitment to protecting certain basic socialist principles against a common enemy. And nowhere was the enemy more threatening than during and after the turbulent events of autumn 1989. 10 'Maelzel's Chess Player Goes to Hollywood: Das Verschwinden des kiinstlerischen Produzenten im Zeitalter der technischen Reproduzierbarkeit', in Christoph Hein, Die finfte Grundrechenart: Aufsatze und Reden I987-Iggo (Frankfurt a.M.: Luchterhand, 1990), pp. 28-33. 11 'Lorbeerwald und Kartoffelacker: Vorlesung ilber einen Satz Heinrich Heines', in Christoph Hein, Offentlich Arbeiten (Berlin and Weimar: Aufbau, 1987), pp. 27-28. 12 See Christoph Hein, Ulrich Schreiber, and others, Kunst als Opposition (Essen: Die Blaue Eule, I990).</page><page sequence="9">Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' That the anti-Stalinist tone of Hein's speeches and interviews during the Wende is flanked, from the beginning, by anti-capitalist elements is thus biographically consistent, for if Stalinism posed a threat to the third way, a truly democratic socialism, then capitalism posed an even greater one. Hein launched himself into a fight on two fronts. In his interview with Der Spiegel on 29 October 1989, when asked to state three wishes, he started by asking for an end to West German 'Abwerbung', more or less implying that the steady depopulation of East Germany was due mainly to this rather than to the lack of reforms in the GDR. In the same interview he seems to see in Egon Krenz the reform potential of a Gorbachev, although he knew that Krenz had praised the Chinese government for the bloody repression of uprisings in Peking earlier in 1989 (KS, p. 159). It seems likely that when addressing the West, Hein's concern is to defend the imperfect status quo in the GDR, as this is certainly preferable to capitalism and has to be protected against what he felt to be Western imperial interests. When addressing the East, however, at least before the fall of the wall, his aim is to criticize the GDR's government, applying pressure to its leadership and calling for an acceleration in the pace and extent of internal reforms. This leads to ambivalences, even self-contradictions. In the October interview in Der Spiegel, Hein is defiantly confident in the face of Western scepticism that the new government of the GDR under Egon Krenz will support the reform movement. Yet in a podium discussion in East Berlin the next day, he expresses severe doubts as to the credibility of the GDR government's commitment to democracy, and is afraid that the reform movement might be crushed by officialdom as it was in Eastern Europe in 1956 (KS, p. I67). Hein's varying appraisal of the situation may, of course, be the result of genuine uncertainty. While Egon Krenz's past was hardly that of a zealous reformer, he did seem more open to ideas of reform than Honecker. But that Hein's opinion should so consistently vary depending on the addressee suggests that his personal attitude might also have been a product of tactical exigencies: the socialist order can be criticized from within, but in the face of Western interests it must be defended, and so the tone becomes one of uncritical solidarity. Throughout the Wende, Hein upheld the traditional Cold War idea that capitalism and socialism are mutally antagonistic and mutually exclusive. That reform socialism might, as some models in fact did, consider integrating elements of capitalism, is something he does not contemplate. When the wall came down and thousands of East Germans flooded westwards for a taste of the capitalist life-style, Hein preferred to stay in the East passing scornful judgement, in part on his fellow-citizens. On 12 November 1989, in 'Ein Brief an Sara', he praises his son for being aristocratic enough to resist the impulse tojoin the mass exodus to the west; most farmers, he notes, not without satisfaction, have more important things to do than visit West Berlin (KS, p. i88), and in the same letter he dismisses an old lady, confused in her euphoria, as insane. In 'Ein Brief an Sara' he can also describe the fall of the wall in positive terms, referring to it as the 'Tanzboden der Deutschen' (KS, p. I84). But these positive tones have a muted, concessionary quality; for the most part he concentrates on the negative aspects: traffic jams in the West, empty shops in the East, black-market exploitation and wage discrepancies between West and East. He began to distance himself from the GDR people at this point, and it should be stressed that his reaction was typical: many East German intellectuals were disgusted by their nation's sudden surge westwards, and it was this disgust, and notjust the sudden interest of East Germans 696</page><page sequence="10">WILLIAM NIVEN 697 in consumerism rather than reforms, that caused the later much-lamented breach between intellectuals and Volk. Hein's reaction is not dissimilar to the erstwhile tendency of SED representatives to accuse East German refugees of ingratitude. After 9 November 1989, it became increasingly clear to Hein that while Stalinism seemed to have been overcome, the threat of capitalism was increasing. His commitment to reform socialism, increasingly shot through with doubts as to the chances of success, took on a defiant, assertive quality. He continued to fight on two fronts, only now both fronts were anti-capitalistic. On the one hand he tried to warn his fellow-citizens against capitalism: in an interview with Junge Welt on 12 Decem- ber 1989, he stressed that the defeat of reform socialism would mean that capitalism would be able to cast off some of the friendlier colours it had assumed in response to the existence of a socialist alternative (KS, p. 2I3). On the other hand, using the same argument, he tried to discourage West Germans from any thoughts they might have of imposing their system on the East. In a speech made in Dfisseldorf on 13 December 1989 in honour of Max Frisch who hadjust been awarded the Heinrich Heine Prize, he appeals to their egoism, warning them of the consequences of a capitalism unfettered by the influence of socialism (KS, p. 250). The logic of his position as far as his West German audience is concerned is that a further socialist experiment must be launched because only the continuation of socialism can guarantee the FRG's living standards. That capitalism in West Germany may have owed some of its positive features to a fear of the appeal of socialism is a defensible if controversial argument. But it is a falsification to claim that socialism was the sole source of capitalism's social conscience. Given that GDR socialism had long since lost any appeal it might have had, capitalism, if Hein's theory were right, could long have afforded to dispense with some of its 'friendlier colours'. To some East Germans, however, it may now seem as if Western capitalism has cast off some of these colours. At the time of reunification, Chancellor Kohl promised prosperity in the 'neue Bundeslander'. The present reality, however, is large-scale unemployment. It may be that Hein's warnings in respect of capitalism were meant as an antidote against the often extreme enthusiasm towards the West of many GDR citizens in 1989 and I990. But at the same time these warnings are highly exaggerated, negative projections which, one suspects, are designed to scare people away from capitalism and win their support for reform socialism. Hein's use of negative propaganda rather than cogent positive argument indicates that he himself no longer believes in the persuasive power of a socialist reformist ideology, so he resorts to desperate measures not dissimilar to those used by the SED in their attempts over the years to undermine the appeal of capitalism. Hein's anti-capitalism prior to the Wende was always tendentious. After the Wende, it becomes openly repressive and Stalinistic in the sense that he uses it as an instrument to try to prevent East Germans making the decision they were in the process of making. The over-inflated horror-scenario of capitalism is perhaps best symbolized by the parallel he draws between Stalinism and capitalism, describing them both as dragons (KS, p. 249). Hein's disgust at the appeal of capitalism after 9 November was such that he even seemed to consider direct preventive measures. In the interview on I2 December 989 with Junge Welt, he talks of one of the duties of the GDR government being the 'Schutz nach auBen' (KS, p. 212). Earlier, in 'Ein Brief an Sara' on IO November, he writes that the opened wall could lead to</page><page sequence="11">698 Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' destabilization and economic collapse in the GDR and result in a 'zwar notwendige, aber gewaltsame Losung' (KS, p. I87). It may be that Hein, who erroneously imagined that the collapse of the wall could lead to an exacerbation of the Cold War, whereas in fact it brought about its end, is only expressing fears here, but the adjective 'notwendig' suggests that he might at some level welcome a Stalinist-style imposition of repressive controls to stem the tide westwards. Hein not only daemonizes capitalism, he also trivializes it. Thus in a letter of 20 November 1989 to the Rowohlt Verlag, he concludes, in reference to a possible failure of democratic socialism: 'Wenn wir scheitern, friBt uns McDonald' (KS, p. I99). In another letter, this time to GustavJust on 16 December 1989, he writes of the GDR being stranded 'aufdem groBen Riff "Dresdner Bank"' (HTD, p. I9I). Such contemptuous metonyms are, of course, a reflex of wounded pride. They are typical of GDR writers' reactions to capitalism after the Wende. 'Der Sozialismus geht,Johnny Walker kommt', writes Volker Braun in a poem, parodying a television advertisement.13 And Stefan Heym created the spectacular compound 'die Daimler- Messerschmitt-B6lkow-Blohm-BASF-Hoechst-Deutsche-Bank-Republik'.14 This is the language of a commercial takeover, the scornful implication being that the high ideals of reform socialism are being sacrificed as the GDR is sold out to the highest bidder. Quite apart from the fact that the reduction of capitalism to one (or more) of its (often more obviously trivial) parts is a crass over-simplification of capitalist reality, the above argumentation ignores the fact that East Germans chose capitalism; the success of capitalism is presented purely from a negative perspective as the undesirable consequence of the failure of reform socialism. In the course of 1990, Hein frequently used words such as 'verludert', 'versaubeutelt', and 'vertan' to refer to the lost chance of a socialist alternative. Again, this suggests wilful rejection rather than the positive exercise of choice in favour of capitalism and reunification. The implication is always that a better life as a result of reform socialism was a realistic, tangible prospect, not, as it was for most East Germans, an unlikely dream in view of the experience of history. But it is the daemonization of capitalism that dominates Hein's response, nowhere more so than in the equation of Stalinism and capitalism that increasingly becomes a prominent feature of his view of events after the autumn of 1989. Thus in a speech given on 6 May 1990 in Vienna on receiving the Erich Fried Prize, he refers to 'die Wuiste der Intoleranz und Gewalt' which used to be called Stalinism and has now merely changed its name (HTD, p. 31). Capitalism is meant. In the same speech, he stresses that Stalinism is not restricted to Russia, nor even to the countries of real existing socialism. He refers to it as a general 'Gesellschaftskonzept' (HTD, p. 24). In an interview in February I991 with Klaus Hammer, Hein refers to the continued existence of'structures' against which he had warned in his Alexander- platz speech on 4 November 1989 (CB, p. 48). He makes the same point in an interview with Frauke Meyer-Gosau inJuly 1991 (HTK, p. 91). At the time he had been warning against Stalinism, not capitalism; he is reinterpreting, in fact falsifying his original intention. He provides enough examples of the links he perceives between Stalinism and capitalism. Witness his reference in the 1991 interview with 13 '0 Chicago! O Widerspruch!', in Die Zickzackbriicke: Ein Abrifikalender (Halle: Mitteldeutscher Verlag, 1992), p. 8i. 14 'Neue Hoffnung fur die DDR', Die Zeit, 42 (13 October 1989), 5, republished in Stefan Heym, Einmischung: Gesprache, Reden, Essays (Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer, I992), p. 224.</page><page sequence="12">WILLIAM NIVEN 699 Frauke Meyer-Gosau to 'die Zensur des Marktes' (HTK, p. 85), a formulation which in its very language posits a parallel between censorship in the GDR and the conditions imposed upon writers by the book market in capitalism. In an interview with Sigrid L6ffler of 11-12 March I990, he perceives in the Western cultural establishment 'Literaturwachter' comparable in their censoriousness to the GDR's top censor Kurt Hager (HTD, p. 4I). More generally, he even suggests in a speech given in Dresden on 9 February I99I that while being unique, as the MfS also it embodied a specifically GDR form of Anpassung that had corresponding forms in the West of Germany.15 Possibly the most striking example of the purely linguistic level at which this tendency to equate could operate was Hein's essay on the subject of'AuslanderhaB' in Germany, which appeared in Der Spiegel on 9 December I991.16 In the essay, he claims that the Western world, fearing a drop in living standards, has no wish to share its resources with foreigners and has built a 'Mauer aus Geld' to keep them out. His use of the word 'Mauer', a wall of money being, he says, much stronger than a wall of stone, evokes, as it is supposed to, memories of the wall between East and West Germany. Just as there was a Stalinist wall, he implies, so there is a capitalist one, only of more resistant material. The novelist Hans Christoph Buch took Hein to task for the anti-capitalist sentiments of the essay, accusing him of trading SED propaganda ('aus der Mottenkiste der SED-Propaganda ein Feindbild hervor- gekramt') and of arguing in a manner as intolerant as the intolerance he is describing.17 Certainly Hein, in presenting racism as a capitalist reflex, seems more interested in using the issue for his own anti-capitalist ends than in objectively examining the causes, which are much more complex than he would allow. In an interview on 29January 1993 with the Sonntag successor Freitag, of which Hein is an editor, he was quick to accuse Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Henryk Broder of one-sidedness for allegedly pinning the blame for racism on the Eastern part of Germany.18 Yet in his Der Spiegel essay, Hein was guilty of an equally biased picture. Western capitalism may, arguably, have autocratic features. But the suggestion that capitalism is but Stalinism under another name is a misrepresentation. Hein himself admitted, in a more objective moment, that capitalism was the more flexible and pluralistic system.19 But from the moment capitalism developed into as much of a threat to reform socialism as Stalinism, it seems, these two forces became as one in his mind. By imagining that reunification simply means the takeover of one form of Stalinism from another, Hein is able to continue living out a fixed psychological and artistic pattern of rejection of and opposition to the status quo. Just as he was an opponent of oppression in the GDR, so he can continue to be this in the FRG. Interestingly, he admitted in I991, in a discussion with Berlin schoolchildren, that many other GDR writers were having problems because of the 'Verlust des 15 'Ansichtskarte einer deutschen Kleinstadt', in Deutsche Ansichten: Die Republik im Ubergang, ed. by Michael Muller and Wolfgang Thierse (Bonn: Dietz, 1992), p. 77. 16 'Wir haben Angst zu verarmen: Christoph Hein fiber Auslanderfeindlichkeit und Armut in Deutsch- land', Der Spiegel, 50 (9 December I99I), 75-8I. 17 'Offener Brief an Christoph Hein', die tageszeitung, 8January 99 (also in Deutsche Literatur I992, ed. by FranzJosef Gortz, Volker Hage, and Uwe Wittstock (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1993), pp. 2 -22). 18 'Der Waschzwang ist da, also muB gewaschen werden: Gesprach mit Christoph Hein iiber Christa Wolf und die Wirkung von Stasiakten', Freitag, 5 (29January I993). 19 'Christoph Hein: Gesprach vom 14.

But his continued rejection of capitalism throughout the early I99os must be seen in context. It is but the negative aspect of a continued uncritical commitment to utopian socialism on his part which causes him notjust to blackball, or refuse to acknowledge, the present but also to misread the past and to lose himself in speculative visions of the future. One might have expected that Hein's reaction to the failure of the hopes of a truly socialist GDR would have been to ask what had gone wrong, taking a clear awareness of the situation (the success of capitalism and, subsequently, reunifi- cation) as a starting-point for a kind of stock-taking. It is not possible to date precisely when he completely accepted this failure, but it was certainly some time in December 1989 (after his Frisch speech in Diisseldorfon 13 December, where he had still voiced hopes) or January I990. In his book Das Perestrojka-Journal, Wolfgang Haug, commenting on I4January 1990 on an unpublished speech of Hein's on GDR radio, maintained: 'Er gehort zu den Revolutionaren in der DDR, denen die Revolution abhanden zu kommen scheint.'21 While Hein certainly lost hope of the realization of true socialism within the context of the present, however, it cannot be said that he lost revolutionary hopes altogether. On the contrary, he simply reacted to the success of capitalism by transplanting hopes of the socialist victory into the future. The course of recent history is reinterpreted in the name of a projected socialist rebirth. It was in his Erich Fried speech on 6 May I990 that Hein, commenting on the apparent triumph of capitalism, strongly resisted the self-satisfied notion of an 'end of history' in favour of a dynamic, dialectical view. Before the events of autumn 1989, he had also consistently criticized official GDR propaganda for presenting the GDR as the victor of history. But the application of the same argument to capitalism does seem opportunistic. That the victors, as he puts it in his February I991 interview with Klaus Hammer, are always corrected by history more or less annuls the capitalist success (CB, p. 47). 'Sein Scheitern wird auch kommen', he says of capitalism in an interview in Freitag on 28 May 1993.22 The present is invalidated by viewing it from some projected hypothetical point in the future. Hein's reactions to events in Germany between I990 and I992 are characterized by a vision of a deterioration in national standards and international relations. Reunification is viewed by him as a threat to European stability, and in one interview he expresses a fear of nationalistic and expansionist urges (above all in the question of the Oder-Neisse border between Poland and Germany).23 Later, he descries in Ger- many a reluctance to confess the censorious reporting of the Gulf War, a persecution of individuals by the mass media, and a developing racism which he interprets as an incipient collapse of liberalism.24 These readings project an aggressive, dangerous trend, representing another aspect of Hein's daemonization of capitalism, but at the same time the impression is of loss of self-control, of a process of dilapidation against 20 'Christoph Hein im Gesprach mit Schuilern der Carl-von-Ossietzky-Oberschule Berlin-Pankow' (Eine Produktion des Senders Freies Berlin, I99I). 21 Wolfgang Fritz Haug, Das Perestrojka-Journal (Berlin: Rotbuch, I990), p. 272. 22 'Ich werde als DDR-Schriftsteller in die Grube fahren', Freitag, 22 (28 May I993). 23 'Wird Europa auch zur Bronx: Ein Gesprach mit Christoph Hein', Wiener Zeitung 1 50 (3 July I990). 24 'Ansichtskarte einer deutschen Kleinstadt', in Deutsche Ansichten: Die Republik im Ubergang, p. 8 .</page><page sequence="14">WILLIAM NIVEN which he sets the counteractive force of a renascent socialism. More generally for the West as a whole, he believes that the integration of the Eastern bloc countries will mean an end to NATO and lead to a 'fruitful' destabilization and even to an end of the Western system.25 While the 'victor of history' can expect future defeat, Hein argues in his Fried speech, the 'loser' is the one who can hope for future success (HTD, pp. 29-30). This idea that loss is productive and victory counter-productive also plays a central role in Hein's most recent novel, Das Napoleonspiel, published in I993. There the first-person narrator W6rle maintains that victory constitutes 'ein Ende und ein Ende ohne Reiz'. 'Der Sieg', he maintains, 'ist unser aller Totengriber.' Defeat, on the other hand, he sees as having a regenerative impact: 'Verlust scharft den Blick.'26 W6rle is not Hein, but his philosophy is in this particular point indeed close to his creator's. In his Fried speech, Hein stresses the enlivening effect of ruins, and in I991, in the televised discussion with schoolchildren, he asserts: 'Der Ruin ist wirklich ein Neuanfang.'27 The analogy reminds one, of course, of Johannes R. Becher's famous dictum 'Auferstanden aus Ruinen'. Hein himself even writes of 'Tod und Auferstehung' in his Fried speech (HTD, p. 26). Thus it is that the collapse of socialism in 1989 is seen not as meaning the end of socialism but, on the contrary, as a prerequisite to its rebirth in a purer form. Just as the validity of the capitalist victory is questioned from the future, so the future is called upon to relativize the impression of a socialist failure. The appropriation of the Christian topos of death and resurrection is reminiscent, mutatis mutandis but none the less uncomfortably, of nationalist attempts in the 1920s and 1930s to interpret the First World War and the Versailles Treaty as a martyrdom upon which the rebirth of Germany must necessarily follow. Whether in the interests of socialist utopia or German national- ism, the life of Christ is being metaphorically used to manufacture victory from defeat. In an interview with Frauke Meyer-Gosau inJuly 1991, Hein, recalling Karl Marx, talks of October 1989 as meaning a 'Fortraumen der versteinerten Verhalt- nisse', leaving a bare ground that is none the less 'Mutterboden, auf dem etwas wachsen kann' (HTK, p. 90). The 'etwas' Hein was thinking of and which he describes as a 'Bliimchen' is the socialist utopia. Here, in highly sentimental and rather tainted language, the 1989 revolution is interpreted not as a liberation from socialism but as the liberation ofsocialism. This argument is the key to Hein's attempt to interpret events in terms of death and rebirth. In his mind there is no doubt that the socialism characteristic of the Eastern bloc countries (real existing socialism) is not in any sense socialist. This contradicts the fact that he had stayed in the GDR because he certainly regarded it as at least in part socialist and had hopes of it becoming more so. Yet again and again after the Wende he stresses the idea most pointedly expressed in the axiom: 'Was am real-existierenden Sozialismus real war, war nicht sozialistisch, was sozialistisch war, war nicht real' (HTK, p. 91). He posits a mutual antagonism between real existing socialism and true socialism, suggesting on several occasions that the latter was severely wounded or damaged by the former. In his speech of I o December 1989 in honour of Gustav Just, he maintains that the aim of the GDR's leaders was 'die Zerst6rung des Sozialismus' (KS, p. 235). This argument has two functions. On the 25 'Wird Europa auch zur Bronx', Wiener Zeitung, I50 (3July 990). 26 Das Napoleonspiel (Berlin and Weimar: Aufbau, I993), pp. 40-41. 27 'Christoph Hein im Gesprach', I991. 70I</page><page sequence="15">Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' one hand, it enables the ideal of socialism to emerge uncompromised, as a victim rather than a perpetrator, from its historical implementation. Such exculpation overlooks the critical argument that the original socialist vision might well have carried within it the seeds of repression (witness the ideas of a planned economy or the dictatorship of the proletariat); political and social ideals cannot be judged independently of the historical form in which they are realized. On the other hand, the notion that ideal socialism was a victim of real existing socialism suggests that October 1989 and the overcoming of Stalinism meant the liberation of the ideal from its antagonistic misrepresentation. While the end of the real existing form of socialism actually led to reunification under capitalist conditions, Hein would prefer to interpret it as a release of, and therefore in a sense as a victory for, the ideal form. Contrary to his interpretation, the prospects of a new socialist venture some time in the future have actually been diminished by the Wende and what followed, rather than enhanced by them. For what happened was notjust that real existing socialism came to end; following this, the East German people had a chance to opt for an attempt at a reformed, improved socialism and turned this chance down. This fact is one which over the last two or three years Hein has been at pains to overlook or invalidate. He has claimed repeatedly that he had no illusions in October and November 1989 (CB, p. 42), knowing that the chances of a reformed socialism in the GDR had already ended in 1968 when the Warsaw Pact troops invaded Prague. Given his intense commitment beyond all pessimism to reform socialism in these months, this claim seems like an attempt to appear wise after the event. And it has the effect of annulling the historical relevance of the refusal of a renewed attempt at socialism on the part of the GDR population after the Wende. His argument runs: Stalinism made true socialism impossible, Stalinism is over, ergo true socialism is a viable option again. Hein's denial of having entertained any reformist hopes not surprisingly led people to ask why he had stayed in the GDR. When asked this question by a schoolgirl in I991, he replied with the phrase 'man muB die versteinerten Verhalt- nisse zum Tanzen bringen'.28 This is not the first time he has used this formulation, which reflects his Marxist self-understanding. But his focus after the Wende on only this aspect of his pre- 1989 role, to the exclusion of his reformist commitment over the years, fulfils a function. It enables him to bypass the accusation of naivety or collaboration and emerge as someone whose only interest in the GDR was in destabilizing it, helping it to crumble away. This impression is confirmed by his post-Wende insistence, unusual for someone who has elsewhere vehemently and on countless occasions claimed that he is not a prophet, but a chronicler, that he portrayed the end of the GDR in his works, a claim which he initially applied to only one or two of these, but which subsequently underwent a degree of inflation, culminating in the assertion that he had predicted this end eleven times.29 His xuvre, it is implied, was a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. The end of the GDR, then, appears as Hein's aim and intention: 'Die Geschichte ist wieder in Fahrt gekommen', he claims in his 1991 interview with Meyer-Gosau (HTK, p. 90). Thus he not only rescues socialism from apparent defeat, he also revaluates his own pre-1989 role. The projection of the hopes for the realization of 28 'Christoph Hein im Gesprach', I991. 29 'Warum ich in der DDR geblieben bin: Theater Heute-Gesprach mit dem Schriftsteller Christoph Hein', Theater Heute (April 1992), 32. 702</page><page sequence="16">WILLIAM NIVEN 703 the thus refurbished vision into the future depends, of course, on the availability of a revolutionary potential within capitalism. Hein's changing attitude to the appli- cability of the term 'revolutionary' is revealing. Initially, he did not see the events of October and November 1989 as a revolution. In an interview with the Berliner Zeitung on 4 November I989, he rejected the term. The reason for his rejection was that he saw no indication of the 'Produktionsverhaltnisse' or 'Eigentums- verhaltnisse' being called into question. He preferred to use the term 'Reformation' (KS, p. I80). But then, on 13 December 1989, in his Frisch speech in Dusseldorf, he presents himself as a 'nicht-beauftragter Emissar der revolutionaren Reformation in meinem Land' (KS, p. 249). Quite apart from the fact that he here claims a representative role which in fact resulted in misrepresentation (by this stage it could hardly be said that people in the GDR wanted socialism) the mixture of terms here is interesting because it indicates a moment of linguistic and conceptual transition. From now on, Hein refers to the autumn of 1989 as a revolution. His interview with Meyer-Gosau inJuly 1991 would seem to suggest that it was the events of November 1989 that caused him to see developments as revolutionary. Revolutions, he claims, have two phases. He would seem to be referring here to a 'positive' pre-mural and (for him) a 'negative' post-mural phase (HTK, p. 90). But the change of termino- logy, I think, has another cause: the desire to glorify retrospectively the events of i989 and also to reclaim for the East Germans a special identity. He repeatedly refers, when talking of German reunification, to the East Germans as the revolution- ary part of the German people.30 For him they carry hopes of the future socialist utopia. These developments in Hein's thinking betray a manipulation of attitudes in the interests ofutopianism. Probably the most questionable aspect of this manipulation is his tendency to provide an apology for Stalinism. The suggestion that the characteristics found in Stalinism are inherent in capitalism provides an apology; the uniqueness of its criminality is relativized. But Hein goes further than this. At one point in his Fried speech he asks himself where socialism went wrong; instead of investigating the possibility that socialist idealism was inherently flawed, positive and negative features co-existing, he suggests a strictly diachronic moment of transition from innocence to guilt, as it were a fall from grace. But he cannot historically locate this moment. The source of aberration, he writes, could have been Stalin, Lenin, February 1917, the nineteenth century, or even the Sermon on the Mount (HTD, p. 24). While it is certainly right to question the validity of a psychohistory which attributes the roots of all Stalinist evil to Stalin, the vast historical perspective opened up by Hein, stretching back as it does into the nebulous era of biblical times, has the effect of suggesting that Stalinism may be the result of a (now indeterminable) historical cause or chain of historical causes and thus not responsible for its own crimes. The belief in a point of aberration brings to mind the inescapability of original sin and projects a historical determinism. For Hein, it is merely a question of returning to the status quo before the aberration, which is conjured implicitly throughout the Fried speech as a Garden of Eden. This speech is a logical continuation of ideas he expressed in his Alexanderplatz speech on 4 November 1989, in which it was the perpetrators rather than Stalinism 30 See for instance Christoph Hein, 'Nachdenken fiber Deutschland', Die Weltbihne, Io (6 March I990), 295.</page><page sequence="17">704 Christoph Hein and the 'Wende' itself he had defended (KS, pp. I75-76). He had presented Honecker as being helpless in the face of calcified Stalinist structures. The implication there was that Stalinism was a kind of tragic and ineluctable fate. No one would deny that in the GDR socialism (and that meant Stalinism) was imposed by the Soviet Union. But impersonal grammatical structures in the Alexanderplatz speech ('es entstand eine Gesellschaft'; 'es entstand eine Struktur') underpin the idea of Stalinism as an entirely autonomous process beyond individual guilt and responsibility, which amounts to an exculpation of leaders such as Honecker. Hein was repeatedly criticized for this speech, and his later attempts to interpret it as a prophetic warning against capitalism cannot disguise the sympathy towards Honecker. By referring to the events of October and November 1989 as ending the 'Schlaf der Vernunft', a formulation also taken up by Volker Braun,31 Hein projects responsibility for crimes in the GDR onto an abstract anthropomorphism. The absence of reason is offered as a cause, not the active engagement of negative forces such as destructiveness or hunger for power. In the Alexanderplatz speech he does refer to these negative forces, but he then lists them inversely to the order of their severity, 'Verbrechen' being added almost as an afterthought to other failings, starting with bureaucracy and demagogy. One might conflate the logic of the Alexanderplatz and Fried speeches thus: Stalinism, which elsewhere Hein refers to as a 'machine', is a mechanism set in motion by historical factors which can be guessed at but not clearly identified and thus represent, by virtue of being hard to pin down, an inescapable fate. Just as the machine, helpless, runs on, so those who might want to control it (in Hein's eyes, above all Honecker) are dragged along by it. The minimalization of moral guilt is generally a feature of the Fried speech, which argues that the downfall of Stalinism was the result not of a moral cancer, the existence of which Hein implicitly admits, but the lack of a performance principle or 'Leistungsprinzip' (HTD, p. 28). Interes- ting here, first of all, is the term 'moral cancer'. If moral degeneracy is attributed the status of organic illness, then it is, by association, a biological process and paradoxi- cally an ethically quite neutral development. This sophistry is reflected elsewhere in other biological comparisons, where Hein talks of the state as 'krank' or of Stalinism as a 'Krankheit' (KS, pp. I55-56). His argument in the Fried speech that history is not determined by moral issues is, although overstated, not indefensible. The problem is the trivialization inherent in this view: if history is reduced to causality, ethical performance becomes at best an accompanying circumstance, at worst an irrelevance. In any case, Hein employs a self-defeating argument here. He admits that the lack of a performance principle is related to a lack of democratic forms, thus demonstrating contrary to his intentions that the denial of basic ethical rights, for which he himself fought in the autumn of 1989, was perhaps after all the reason for the collapse of real existing socialism. Thus Hein argues not only that ideal socialism carries no responsibility for Stalinism but also that Stalinism itself cannot properly be held responsible for its own crimes. Conversely, the projection of Stalinist-style flaws into capitalism, the suggestion that capitalism is repressing liberalism and may even be heading for a renewal of fascism, shifts the weight of moral guilt onto the shoulders of capitalism. 31 See Volker Braun, 'Gegen den Schlaf der Vernunft', in Oktober i989 (Berlin: Neues Leben and Elefanten Press, I990), p. 154.</page><page sequence="18">WILLIAM NIVEN 705 It is revealing that he should argue the irrelevance of morality as a historical determiner, and yet also be intent on acquitting socialism and even real existing socialism of moral responsibility while blaming capitalism. He may have started out, in October and November 1989, to call for an open confrontation with the past in the GDR and for an acceptance of guilt; as time went on, however, he takes an increasingly defensive stand, especially as 'Vergangenheitsbewaltigung' in East Germany was now being controlled by the West. He insists, reasonably enough, that the West should also confront its own moral responsibility, but at the same time he is indignant at the manner in which East Germans are being forced, through the medium of the 'Gauck-Beh6rde', to confront their own past. With bitter irony he remarks in the Freitag interview of 29 January I993 ('Der Waschzwang ist da'), 'eigentlich war so etwas erst fur dasJiingste Gericht vorgesehen'. In his short story Matzeln, published in 1992,32 a coal-miner in the Vogtland has been taking wooden discs ('Matzeln') home with him from work for years. These discs, processed from wood no longer required in the mines, have no great worth, and anyway, the coal-miner has only ever taken a few each day. But suddenly a new 'Pfdrtner' reports him to the management, and he is condemned for having stolen 'drei Waggons Stiutzh6lzer' (Matzeln, p. 122). The management has added up the number of 'Matzeln' he took home with him altogether and estimated their worth not in terms of what they now are, old pieces of wood, but what they used to be, parts of wood used in the mines. Although the story is set in the GDR, it reflects Hein's interpretation of current events: essentially venial misdemeanours in a nation's past are made to look worse than they are being taken out of context and viewed together instead of individually. The story is critical of the new 'Pfortner', who clearly has failed to do what was expected of him: 'wachsam zu sein und ein Mensch zu bleiben' (Matzeln, p. 120). When Hein stood on the Alexanderplatz on 4 November 1989 and talked of the possibility of a truly humane socialism becoming reality, it may indeed have sounded to some ears, as the poet Uwe Kolbe imagined it must have done, 'wie infantile Kakophonie'.33 And it seems as if Monika Maron is right when she claims, in reference to events in the GDR in 1989: 'Diese Revolution war kein Aufbruch in die Utopie, sondern ein verzweifelter Sprung aus der Vergangenheit in die Gegen- wart.'34 Nevertheless, Hein and others (such as Heiner Muller) are not to be condemned for continuing to believe in a utopia, socialist or otherwise. The problem, however, as I have shown in this article, is that far from critically reassessing the problematic relationship between utopianism and the darker side of socialist history, Hein tends rather to play down or relativize any responsibility for this past which the utopian vision might have had. And he imposes upon the dialectic fact of present history (the ceding of socialism to capitalism) a projected dialectic fact of the future, in which capitalism would cede to a revitalized socialism. His perspective enables socialism to emerge, to use the phrase he applied critically to the Stalinist rewriting of history, as 'der Sieger der Geschichtsschreibung' (KS, p. I54).
