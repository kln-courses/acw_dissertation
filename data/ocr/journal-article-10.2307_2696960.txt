Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1998. xi, 311 pp. Notes. Bibliography. Index. Illustrations. $59.95, hard bound. Whereas in western European and American literature the so-called demonic fiction is as- sociated with the tradition of romance that minimizes social concerns, By Authors Possessed shows that major Russian demonic narratives are to be found among novels that include a significant element of social or cultural critique. By a thematic analysis, as well as by quick- ening the devils that lurk in the idioms and figurative language, Adam Weiner explores the</page><page sequence="2">242 Slavic Review varieties of the diabolical in Nikolai Gogol"s Dead Souls, Fedor Dostoevskii's The Possessed, and Andrei Belyi's Petersburg. He goes on to argue that the evil represented in these narra- tives partly contaminates the narrative agencies themselves. Accordingly, the aspects of evil on which the book mainly focuses are not cruelty, bru- tality, or treason but soulless existence and, in particular, blasphemous authorship. The book refers to two conflicting views of artistic creativity. One theory, associated with Niko- lai Berdiaev (and largely characteristic of the worldview of Vladimir Nabokov, whose "ex- orcism" of the novel is discussed in chapter 5), presents individual artistic acts as exten- sions of God's creation of the world. The other view, bound up with orthodox religious suspicions of imaginative literature in general, regards unruly creation as a competing al- ternative to God's work and therefore as, possibly, demonic. Weiner argues that Gogol"s, Dostoevskii's, and Belyi's narratives and on-record statements suggest these writers' anxiety that their innermost creative impulse might have been, so to say, from the devil. He links these anxieties with the relevant demonological repertoire, to wit, with different species of indigenous Russian devils, the Bogomil heresy, the folktale images of Kashchei the Death- less, the picaro devils, and the demonic theme in the turn-of-the-century literary and the- ological discourse. Whereas in the discussion of Dead Souls Weiner points to the demonic isolation re- flected in the hypertrophy of gross matter, his discussions of Petersburg and, in particular, of The Possessed, concentrate on the different characters' attempts to usurp authorial pre- rogatives. In The Possessed, for instance, the problematic point of view (the first-person nar- rator gives scenic accounts of things that he never witnessed) is explained by the narrator's own attempt, analogous to those of other characters, to create the world that he ought to be chronicling or, rather, interpreting. Yet Weiner's position becomes vulnerable when he claims that something of the same sort is also true of the "implied author" whose presence is felt through the symbolism and allegorization which are beyond the consciousness of the first-person narrator. The book shows full awareness of the fact that when the phrase "the implied author" was launched (in Wayne Booth's 1961 The Rhetoric of Fiction), it was mainly in order to delegitimate the historical author's biography and on-record views as determining factors in text analysis. Whatever positions the novelists might have pro- claimed in nonfictional writings and however they might have acted in life, what matters is the system of values and ideas inferable from the novels themselves. Modern narratol- ogy, moreover, tends to view novels as complex testing-grounds rather than as expressions of the authors' otherwise documented beliefs. What constitutes an "implied author" is not a fictionalized extension of the historical author's persona but the system of value- laden ideas worked out in the novel. Weiner occasionally slips into personifying the "implied author," yet this methodological flaw is partly compensated by his implicit suggestion that this no- tion should be redescribed in terms of a mobile tension between contradictory ideologi- cal attitudes. One of several ways in which, according to Weiner, Nabokov (endorsing, as it were, Berdiaev's view of creativity), exorcises the demons of authorship, is by laying bare the de- vices of his own artifice while impersonating a benevolent anthropomorphic deity. One may disagree with the details of Weiner's approach to Nabokov and yet applaud his thought-provoking attempt to position Nabokov's oeuvre amid the contrasting strands of Russian literary history. This aim would have been better served by some reference, for the sake of comparison, to the nondemonic classical Russian novels, especially those that could be reasonably placed among Nabokov's precursor texts. However, this gap, obviously a matter of choice, does not detract from one's appreciation of the extensive research, scholarship, and erudition that have gone into the composition of By Authors Possessed.
