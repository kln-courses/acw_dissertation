<plain_text><page sequence="1">The six analyses demonstrate brilliantly the value of reading texts in tandem, for this very practical criticism discovers and displays minute formal, verbal, and structural patterns of essential thematic significance: each text is the brighter for the illumination cast on it by its twin, and scholars of all six authors should welcome the new readings of these major works (despite occasional lapses, such as the conflation of the story of Medea and Jason with that of Deianeira and Heracles on page 57). Less clear, however, is the process by which the earlier texts 'generate' their 'progeny'; why these ancestors, and no others? Why these particular descendants? What sense of genre influences the later authors? There is no invocation of intertextuality as such; the word is mentioned only to illustrate a feature internal to Tristram Shandy (p. I40). Still less do we encounter any Bloomian anxiety of influence, though the wordplay implicit in the generate/progeny/genre sequence should have prompted at least a passing reflection on Bloom's 'family romance'. Seelig's criticism engages only endogamously, within the 'kind' of genre theory itself. Her own strategy is a kind of incremental return to established paradoxes, mirroring the simultaneous circling and progression of the texts she analyses; the gradual narrowing of chronological gaps (three centuries between Donne and Eliot, two between Browne and Thoreau, and one between Burton and Sterne), with the overall merging of the six works under broad questions (time, the self), tends to dissolve the new notion of genre even as Seelig patiently constructs it. If such apparently eclectic texts turn out to have rather a lot in common, we are entitled to question the value of generic labels: it may be that this challenge to conventional views of genre is itself sui generis. UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL PAUL BAINES The Matter ofRevolution: Science, Poetry, and Politics in the Age ofMilton. ByJOHN ROGERS. Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell University Press. I996. xvi + 257 pp. (32. The Matter of Revolution is an ambitious, stimulating foray into intellectual history, which, arguing for the 'interdependence of natural and political philosophy' in the seventeenth century, brings scientific and literary texts into unexpected, illuminating juxtaposition. John Rogers's title contains a pun: vitalist science, a form of animism influenced by alchemical speculation, which briefly flourished in the heady atmosphere of the English Revolution, is presented in this book as intrinsically radical ideologically, whatever the intentions of particular exponents, and as exerting a powerful subterranean influence on such major writers as Milton and Marvell, as well as on such figures as Gerrard Winstanley and Margaret Cavendish. Vitalism, as Rogers presents it, is essentially a philosophy of 'liberal agency', implicitly challenging 'the culturally dominant rhetoric of authoritarian power' (p. 29) and explicitly contesting conventional dualist metaphysics and the material- ism of Hobbes, with its 'world dominated by irresistible external forces' (p. 5). Rogers's thesis is open to challenge in some ways, partly because too many disparate things are made to reflect or parallel one another: to find 'the anticensorship model of the free, unlicensed flow of information, the radical popular model of a popular sovereignty', and an Arminian theology of a 'world released from [.. .] the arbitrary and whimsical God of Calvin' (pp. 22-23) as all somehow reflecting vitalism is to claim too much. But the book succeeds admirably in demonstrating the relevance of vitalism and related scientific speculation to Paradise Lost and 'Upon Appleton House', enabling readers to see these two great poems in a new light. I64 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">MLR, 94. I, I999 The two chapters on Milton are excellent. The first of these persuasively demonstrates the 'entanglement of science and politics' in the varying and sometimes contradictory accounts of Creation and of Chaos in Paradise Lost, exploring the implications, theological and scientific, of such passages as 'downward purg'd I The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs' in Book vII. A second chapter, 'Milton and the Mysterious Terms of History', is primarily concerned with Books xi and xiI, whose 'alarming authoritarianism' (p. 166) seems at variance with the presentation of Christian liberty in the poem. Drawing on the distinction between 'ordinary providence' and 'extraordinary providence' in Milton's Christian Doctrine, Rogers locates and comments perceptively on a fundamental inconsistency in Milton's poem, which on the one hand seeks 'to ground in the authority of science a new logic of individualism, a principle of free agency' (p. 159), yet concludes its action with an extended historical narrative whose principal recurrent feature is 'the direct intervention of an anthropomorphic God' (p. 176) asserting power over his creation by meting out punishment. The vitalist net is stretched almost to breaking-point in an extended comparison between Marvell's pastoral poems and the writings and activities of the Digger Gerrard Winstanley. The treatment here of Winstanley is far too brief, and hardly bears out the generalization that Winstanley's 'activist rhetoric is desperately at odds with his pacifist theology' (at one point Rogers even speaks of'the unfortunate action of digging': depoliticizing the Diggers could not go much further than this). Yet Rogers does show that both Marvell and Winstanley are, like other writers during the years I649 to I652, concerned with a 'crisis of agency' in a period of revolutionary change. The second of the two chapters on Marvell is more consistently successful, and its comparisons of Milton's 'Comus' and 'Ode on the Morning of Christ's Nativity' with the final section of 'Upon Appleton House', praising the young Maria Fairfax in extravagant terms, work far better than those yoking Marvell with Winstanley. In a subtly argued discussion, Rogers examines the links between conscience and the 'power of Chastity' for Marvell and Milton. Once again finding a fruitful inconsistency in Marvell's poem, Rogers treats the transition between Maria as wonder-working virgin and as prospective bride as deeply problematical, in its reliance on competing discourses and contradictory views of nature and of politics. Of the writers treated in The Matter of Revolution, the one most directly influenced by vitalism is Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, whose copious, neglected writings on natural philosophy are the subject of Rogers's final chapter; their neglect, even when she has become an icon of early modern feminism, is understandable when we read that she claimed that a billiard ball moved by it own volition, as it realized it was about to be struck by another billiard ball. But, as Rogers shows throughout this impressive study, the historical significance of vitalism in the seventeenth century does not rest upon experimental verification of its claims.
