Clark National Transportation Safety Board ABSTRACT The National Transportation Safety Board conducted a general aviation crashworthiness study from 1981 to 1985. Three reports were published that 1) validated crashworthiness investigative techniques; 2) defined the impact severity and potential injury prevention for survivable accidents; and 3) defined acceleration loads and velocity changes of survivable accidents. The Safety Board was also able to define the extent that post-crash fires affect survivability. This paper contains extensive excerpts from the three Safety Board reports and is intended as an overview of the Safety Board's effort. The original reports contain more detailed discussions of the points raised here. IN THE YEARS 1972 THROUGH 1981, 36,500 accidents occurred involving general aviation airplanes. Of the 76,600 occupants of these airplanes, more than 12,500 (16 percent) were killed and more than 6,600 (9 percent) were seriously injured. The National Transportation Safety Board's investigations of these accidents found that many of the fatal and serious injuries could have been prevented if the occupants had been provided with effective occupant protection systems. The Safety Board, in 1980, started its General Aviation Crashworthiness Program to provide data to the general aviation industry and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the purpose of improving crashworthiness in general aviation airplanes. The rationale for this program, the program's plan, and the investigative and analytical methodology are described in the Safety Board's report, "General Aviation Crashworthiness Project, Phase One". (1)* *Number in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. The Safety Board on March 15, 1985, issued its Phase Two report (2) which presented more detailed kinematic and injury information on general aviation airplane accidents. The Phase Two data, gathered from more than 500 accidents involving more than 1,200 occupants, were used to define survivable accidents. The report included information on impact severity (impact angles and impact speeds) and provided estimates of the potential benefits from the use of shoulder harnesses and energy absorbing seats. The Safety Board concluded that a potential 20 percent reduction in fatalities could be realized if all occupants were to wear shoulder harnesses; that potentially 88 percent of seriously injured occupants could be expected to incur significantly reduced injuries with the use of shoulder harnesses; and that the availability of energy absorbing seats could have had the potential of reducing significantly the injuries of 34 percent of the seriously injured occupants. For the Phase Three report (3), detailed onscene investigations of 39 selected survivable accidents were completed, documenting the structural deformation of the airplanes, the impact parameters, and the resultant injuries to the occupants. Peak acceleration loads (G's) and velocity changes were then calculated for these accidents, where possible. An understanding of the magnitude of acceleration and velocity changes experienced in the more severe, but survivable, crashes is important if adequate seat/restraint system design requirements are to be established. Once these parameters are established for a range of survivable crash scenarios, reasonable design standards can be developed. These will guide the designer in creating and testing a seat/restraint system which will perform properly during a survivable crash without creating excessive penalties in cost and weight because of unnecessarily severe standards. 6.41 0096-736X/88/9606-0041 $02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Several seat/restraint systems currently in use, such as those in which the shoulder harness is attached to the airplane structure, provide occupant protection to acceleration loads considerably in excess of the minimum 9 G requirement prescribed in 14 CFR 23.561. Energy absorbing seat designs have demonstrated their protective capabilities in severe crashes and many of the seat/restraint systems have been tested dynamically. However, the manufacturers developed these systems without a clear understanding of the airplane occupant's tolerance to abrupt acceleration and without a precise definition of the loads generated in a survivable crash, but with the intuitive belief that these systems offered significantly more protection than was required. In February 1983, an industry task force, the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP), was convened at the invitation of the FAA to explore general aviation safety issues, including crashworthiness. The GASP issued a position paper containing several recommendations dealing with crashworthiness. The GASP forwarded a proposal to the FAA on May 2, 1984, that proposed standards for seats and seat restraints, including requirements for the dynamic testing of seat/restraint systems to 26 G's in the longitudinal direction and provisions for energy management in the vertical direction. The GASP-developed seat testing requirements were stringent enough to ensure that seat and restraint designs would protect most occupants of survivable general aviation airplane crashes. These standards, based on test data and accident data and developed with the expertise of designers and manufacturers, were set to achieve those goals without creating unmanageable design requirements or unnecessarily costly changes. Using crash test data developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (2), seat/restraint test data developed by the Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI), and automobile crash data, the GASP concluded that the recommended test loads and velocity changes accurately represented crash loads and velocity changes experienced by the occupants in survivable transportation accidents. Data regarding survivable acceleration loads in "real world" crashes confirm the validity of the GASP proposal. The appropriateness of the GASP proposal is discussed later in this report. During the Safety Board's accident investigations that form the basis for this report, many seat and restraint design problems were documented, some of which are discussed here. Some of the seat/restraint systems which were examined did not afford adequate crash protection because of specific design problems, even though they met the current FAA design standards. It is believed that many of these problems can be eliminated by more stringent test requirements, including multi-axis dynamic testing, and by better design guidelines. As a result of the Phase Two study, a more detailed examination of the effects of post-crash fire was possible. The Safety Board found that about 14 percent of the fatally injured occupants in fire accidents could have survived had there been no fire. That translates to about a 4- percent yearly reduction in fatalities in all general aviation crashes if post-crash fires were eliminated in survivable accidents. (2) PHASE ONE CRASHWORTHINESS PROGRAM The Safety Board's General Aviation Crashworthiness Program was a multiyear project initiated in October 1981. The field phase of the program was begun on January 1, 1982, concurrent with the introduction of an expanded Safety Board accident/incident report form (NTSB Form 6120.4). The program provided for a systematic investigation of general aviation airplane accidents with emphasis on crashworthiness. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND GOALS - The objective of the crashworthiness program was to develop and disseminate to the FAA and the general aviation industry an envelope of likely peak decelerati ve forces occurring in survivable general aviation airplane accidents, and their effects on the occupants and airplane structure for the purpose of upgrading occupant protection design standards. The reports described and categorized, by severity, crash scenarios for a range of survivable airplane accidents. The program correlated the scenario categories with the savings in lives and the reduction in serious injuries which might be achieved by upgrading the design standards of general aviation airplanes to levels compatible with these scenario categories. The following goals were met: o Establish investigative techniques which will facilitate the collection and analysis of crashworthiness data for general aviation accidents, o Collect and evaluate, through detailed analysis, crashworthiness data on a select sample of survivable general aviation accidents, o Validate analysis techniques which can be applied to the future analysis of the substantial amount of crashworthiness data which will be collected routinely in general aviation accident investigations, o Define crash pulses that describe the impact severity of survivable accidents in general aviation airplanes currently in use. 6.42</page><page sequence="3">871006 o Identify injury-producing mechanisms related not only to the fuselage structure, but to control/display designs, crew/passenger seats, and possible deficiencies in the availability and use of seat belts/shoulder harnesses, and correlate these with the crash loads. o Describe and categorize crash scenario severity based on changes in velocity and impact angle. o Use the crashworthiness data to validate past findings and to support future recommendations. DATA REQUIREMENTS - The crashworthiness evaluation of general aviation airplane accidents required the collection of data addressing three areas: occupant injuries, impact severity, and the airplane's occupant protection capabilities. The causes of injury can be related to both the severity of the impact and the ability of the structure (including seats and restraints) to protect the occupant from the impact. These three areas are focused on by engineers in all vehicle crashworthiness design efforts. Occupant Injuries - The occupant injuries of concern in the crashworthiness study are those resulting from either accelerative or mechanical sources. Abrupt acceleration of the body or parts of the body may result in injuries, such as hyperextension of the cervical spine (whiplash) from longitudinal acceleration, or transection of the aorta from acceleration in the vertical direction. Mechanical injuries, also referred to as blunt trauma or impact injuries, result from the body's striking or being struck by another object. A typical mechanical injury is a fractured skull or facial laceration which results from head contact with the instrument panel or seat back during a crash sequence. The detailed data concerning occupant injuries were collected from autopsy records, hospital records, and interviews with victims and medical/rescue personnel who responded to the accident. Identification of the injury mechanisms or the direct causes of the injuries, an important part of the investigation process, provided information on the occupant protection capabilities of the airplane. Although injuries caused by accelerative forces may be identified as such, the magnitude of the forces causing the injuries must be identified through kinematic analysis of the airplane crash. Impact injuries, in general, can be traced by physical evidence to occupant contact with particular structures in the cockpit or cabin of the airplane. Airplane Impact Severity - The severity of a crash is stated in terms of a crash pulse which relates acceleration ("G") acting at the airplane's center of mass to time. The pulse is determined by the analysis of the airplane's kinematics which is established through the reconstruction of the crash sequence. The kinematic analysis requires knowledge of the velocity change of the airplane, the distance over which the velocity change took place during the principal impact, the airspeed, the flightpath angle, the terrain angle, the airplane's attitude at the principal impact, and the sliding distance after the impact. These values are determined from physical evidence, including damage to the airplane structure, damage to objects in the crash path, and ground scars. Additional data that are useful in establishing the required parameters can be obtained from radar data, aerodynamic analyses, and flight data recorders when they are avail able. Occupant Protect i on Capabi 1 i t i es - The determination of how well an airplane can protect its occupants in a crash depends on more than documentation of injuries and analysis of the airplane's kinematics. Information is required on how much energy of the crash was absorbed by the structure and components through plastic or permanent deformation. Also, information is needed on whether or not the occupants were restrained sufficiently to allow them to have participated in the airplane structure's deceleration, or whether or not they experienced an abrupt, and perhaps nonsurvivable deceleration, because the tie-down chain failed to restrain them. Such information is gathered during a detailed examination of the airplane wreckage. Also, fuselage deformation must be measured to determine whether a livable volume is maintained in the occupied area. Impact damage must be documented and matched to the environmental evidence, i.e., ground scars, tree strikes, and other collisions with obstacles, and evidence must be collected on seats and on the availability and use of restraints, and failures or deformation of these components and the components comprising the rest of the tie-down chain. ANALYSIS METHOD IMPACT SEVERITY - Impact severity can be determined through either an energy management analysis or a kinematic analysis. The energy management analysis uses detailed mathematical modeling of the main airplane structure, using finite element or lumped mass modeling techniques and requires in-depth knowledge of the physical properties of major structural members and their responses under dynamic conditions. Similar techniques have been employed to model the human occupant. Sophisticated computer programs, such as KRASH and SOM-LA (Seat/Occupant Model-Light Aircraft), which were developed as design aids and research tools, provide detailed analytical results of the dynamic response of the airplane 6.43</page><page sequence="4">and the occupant. However, because of the considerable time and technical expertise that are required to model different airplanes in order to utilize such programs, their use is precluded in day-to-day field investigations. The kinematic analysis adopted by the Safety Board simply requires data that can be collected at the crash scene using standard investigative techniques. The analytical process is straightforward and relatively simple to accomplish. The beginning and end of the principal impact are defined, and the peak decelerative force is derived from the estimated velocity change and the distance traveled by the airplane's center of mass during the impact. Because precise engineering information about the reaction of the structure between the starting and the stopping points of the principal impact of a particular crash is not used, the kinematic analysis will not yield a unique crash pulse shape which describes the precise decelerative forces acting on the airplane throughout the crash. However, the analysis will provide a set of peak decelerative force values which should bracket the unique or actual peak force for that crash by determining the minimum possible peak decelerative force and the peak decelerative force for a triangular shaped pulse. In bracketing the actual peak decelerative force, the assumption is made that the decelerative forces are proportional to the mass of structure crushed, which in turn, influences the shape and magnitude of the crash pulse. This analysis methodology worked well when the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) applied it to crash tests of general aviation airplanes that were performed by NASA. (See Phase One report for a complete description and examples. ) To establish an envelope of representative crash forces from the bracketed solutions, it is necessary to use all known facts from field and test data to narrow the bracket for each crash pulse to approach its precise solution. However, the data available from the crash scene may be so limited that the kinematic reconstruction can be performed only for one direction, i.e., the physical evidence may be sufficient to allow an analysis of the vertical crash loads but may be insufficient to allow an analysis of horizontal crash loads. Also, even if in one accident all data could be measured precisely and loads calculated exactly, that accident would not necessarily be representative of all survivable general aviation accidents. Therefore, a substantial number of crash analyses is required to establish the pulse(s) that are representative of current general aviation airplanes. Certain data needed to establish the crash pulses by kinematic analysis are obtained from two procedures. The first procedure is the visualization of the crash sequence, the results of which provide impact attitude and crushing distance. The second procedure is the development of a crash pulse that, when integrated, will generate the documented velocity change and stopping distance. VISUALIZATION Orthographic Drawing - The most effective method of visualizing the impact attitude, flightpath angle, and the amount of crush that occurs is to create an orthographic drawing incorporating the impact data gathered in the field. Damage to the airframe, ground scars, and tree strikes can be documented through the use of measurements, photographs, sketches, and drawings and notes made on airplane three-view drawings. When all available impact information is documented, reconstruction of the airplane's impact attitude is possible, and more confidence can be placed in the attitude reconstruction when several ground scars are present. The technique requires that the ground scars be aligned with the airplane components which caused them. Typically, distinctive gouge marks are left by components, such as landing gears, propellers, engine nacelles, and wing tips. Changes in the airplanes's attitude may result from these components striking the ground during the crash sequence. Crush Line - Another technique for establishing the impact attitude of the airplane is through the use of the crush line. The crush line is formed as a result of the airframe being crushed against a surface and leaving a distinctive flat or "stamped" area on the airframe. In general, the crush line can be identified by small, tight wrinkles in the skin, or by deformation of the airframe surfaces around longerons or stringers. This type of damage is caused by direct contact between the airplane and the ground. Points representing the edges of the damaged areas are plotted on an airplane three- view drawing and straight lines are drawn between these points. Several lines intersect to create an imaginary plane or flat surface, i.e., crush line. The impact attitude can be determined graphically by relating the crush line to the impact surface. The rotation required to place the crush line on the impact surface defines the airplane's pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes at impact relative to that surface. Correcting for surface slope will yield these attitudes relative to the horizon. The pitch attitude of the airplane at impact can be calculated by algebraically adding the values for the flightpath angle and the angle of attack. The flightpath angle is determined by aligning sequentially tree or object strikes and the ground impact point. The angle of attack can be estimated based on the airplane's speed and maneuvers just before impact. Although not as precise as using several ground scars, the value for pitch attitude derived by this method is 6.44</page><page sequence="5">871006 sufficiently accurate for purposes of analysis when no other information is available. Change in Velocity - Once the stopping distance has been established, the change in velocity during the principal impact must be determined. The initial velocity is estimated based on knowledge of the airplane's maneuvers just before impact, the airplane's performance parameters, the pilot's statement, or a witness statement. For example, an airplane may have been seen flying level in a nose high attitude and pitching over just before hitting the ground. From this information, it can be assumed that the airplane was at or near stall speed when the impact occurred. Another example is a twin-engine airplane that crashes out of control after power is lost in one engine. In this case, it is reasonable to estimate that the initial velocity was near the airplane's single engine minimum control speed (vmca) • Witness statements, radar data, and airspeed readouts from flight data recorders, if available, also are helpful in estimating the initial velocity. The total velocity component at the principal impact acts along the flightpath. The flightpath angle is used to break down the total velocity component into its vertical and horizontal components, relative to the horizon. In the vertical direction, the final velocity is used to determine the velocity change. The final velocity usually is zero because the maximum vertical crush is achieved when the downward movement is stopped by the ground during the principal impact. As vertical velocity becomes zero, the maximum vertical crush is achieved. In the horizontal direction, most airplanes tend to slide along the ground for some distance after the principal impact, and the difference between the initial velocity and the final velocity (a value greater than zero) must be established for the principal impact. In crashworthiness analysis, the velocity change is the most critical item and is the most difficult parameter to estimate. In the formulas for the calculation of the G-loads, the velocity appears as a squared factor, thus magnifying small errors in the estimate. Last second maneuvers of the airplane (controlled or uncontrolled) also can change the velocity by a small but important amount. Accounting for these changes is a difficult task and care must be taken to utilize all available information. After establishing values for distance and velocity changes during the principal impact, the final step is to estimate the horizontal and vertical crash pulses, or a combined pulse, which represents the change in velocity over the measured stopping distance. METHOD VERIFICATION Verification of the accuracy of the techniques used to determine the crash pulse was accomplished through the analysis of four NASA tests, using NASA's published data. (6) This effort included comparison of Safety Board analyses based on physical evidence from NASA crash tests of general aviation airplanes with the actual parameters and results from those tests. Crash loads based on rectangular and triangular shaped crash pulses were calculated for each crash test. PITCH ATTITUDE - Several crash tested airframes, which were stored at the NASA Langley Research Center, were inspected and documented by Safety Board investigators, using the Board's normal accident investigation procedures. The goal of the exercise was to establish the airplane's impact attitude based only on the crush line and other fuselage deformation. Once the damage was documented and an impact attitude was established, a comparison was made with the NASA data, i.e., actual decelerations measured by instrumentation during the crash tests. The measurements taken from the crush lines of the test airplanes were found to approximate closely the airplane's attitudes at full development of the crushing. The comparison measurements were taken from NASA's crash test films. The film analyses showed that, when crashed on concrete, the airplanes tended to rotate or bend during the principal impact, causing a change in pitch attitude between 3° and 9°. An example of this pitch rotation was identified in the film of a 45° nose down drop test. The airplane initially contacted the ground at 45°, but at the fully crushed position, the fuselage had rotated to a pitch angle of 36°. In the analyses of other drop test films, it was found that several of the 30° nose down tests resulted in pitch attitudes of 26°, and for 15° nose down tests, the pitch attitudes at full crush development were 12°. Other techniques for estimating pitch attitude also were verified. One technique was the use of distinct bend lines found in the floor boards of the test vehicles. Parallel wrinkles in the fuselage skin were reasonable indicators of pitch attitude at full development of the crush. In general, the parallel wrinkles were found to be valid indicators if they did not emanate from an area of major structure. Each of the techniques described is a useful tool for estimating pitch attitude at impact. However, an investigator must exercise sound judgment in basing conclusions on this evidence because each piece, taken by itself, can be misleading. Conclusions with the highest level of confidence result from the use of a number of techniques to confirm an impact attitude. 6.45</page><page sequence="6">CRASH PULSE - A visualization of each test was made to establish the target values for distance. The NASA values for velocity and flightpath angle were used in calculating the crash pulse. The impact data could not be generated for the NASA tests as they would be in an NTSB field investigation. Velocity, impact attitude, angle of attack, and flightpath were artificially set for test purposes for the NASA tests and their values could not be estimated by using techniques that would be applied in the field. Crash pulses first were calculated relative to earth axes, then converted to airplane axes to allow comparison with accelerometer data from the NASA tests. Initial evaluations indicated that when the airplane crashed on an unyielding surface, such as concrete, the predominant (reaction) occurred in the vertical direction relative to the earth. However, when the crash occurred on a yielding surface, such as dirt, the loads were predominantly longitudinal, relative to the airplane axis as it dug into the ground. Stated in another manner, in both cases, the reaction to the force of the impact was normal, or at right angles to the impact surface. This reaction follows Newton's third law of motion which states that, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the airplane crashes on a yielding surface but does not dig in and stop, the physical evidence must be carefully evaluated to determine in which axis the predominant loading occurs. Identification of the predominant axis is important because analysis of the crash loads along this axis is more accurate and more easily accomplished rather than attempting the analysis in a nonpredominant axis, and then translating the results to the predominant axis. Some disagreement will arise in the comparison of the published test data with the calculated crash pulse data during verification because the time histories of the vertical and horizontal pulses cannot be compared. If the vertical and horizontal crash pulse peaks do not occur at the same time, the vector analysis, using the vector sums, is not entirely accurate. However, the calculations for the predominant pulse and the total vector sum will be reasonably accurate. Results of Safety Board documentation and analysis of two NASA general aviation crash tests using the methodology presented, compared well with NASA's published test data. This indicates that the methodology and assumptions developed for use in this program are valid. PHASE TWO METHODOLOGY To define the impact severity of survivable accidents and to estimate the benefits to be derived from the availability and use of shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats, the Safety Board used data available in the investigative reports of 535 selected accidents that occurred in 1982 to perform a detailed analysis of crash kinematics and occupant injuries. Accidents selected as suitable for this examination were general aviation airplane accidents in which at least one occupant was fatally or seriously injured. Certain airplanes such as aerial application airplanes, homebuilt airplanes, and older airplanes of fabric and tube construction were excluded. The selected accidents also were limited to airplanes which are expected to continue to be in production and hence would be the most likely candidates for improved crashworthy designs. Data available concerning each of these accidents were evaluated by investigators experienced in the analysis of patterns of injury causation in general aviation airplane accidents. A detailed analysis was made by examining completed investigative forms, narratives, photographs, witness statements, and medical information in order to estimate the extent to which each accident was survivable and to compile information on impact speeds and impact angles. For the purpose of this study, an accident was considered to be survivable when a livable cabin volume was maintained throughout the crash sequence and the forces transmitted to the occupant through the seat and restraint system did not appear to have or should not have exceeded the limits of human tolerance to abrupt accelerations. Therefore, an accident was considered to be survivable when at least one occupant either survived or could have survived if shoulder harnesses or energy-absorbing seats had been used. A partially survivable accident is a survivable accident in which at least one fatality occurred that could not have been prevented. Potential survivors were identified in each accident by examining accident data describing the damage to the airplane and the injuries of each occupant. First, the "livable volume" was evaluated for each seat. Photographic documentation was the primary source of this information. To be considered livable, each space where an occupant was seated had to have remained large enough for survival throughout the crash sequence. Individual locations considered nonsurvivable were those where the livable volume had been reduced drastically or had been destroyed. An example of a nonsurvivable accident is one in which the volume had been reduced during the crash by a crushing structure that had rebounded, thus giving a final appearance of a livable volume. Secondly, the injuries of each of the occupants were evaluated separately, taking into account the availability and use of occupant restraints and the retention of seat structures in their 6.46</page><page sequence="7">871006 normal positions, post-crash fires, and other important factors. An assessment was made, wherever possible, of the degree to which injuries could have been lessened by the use of shoulder harnesses or energy-absorbing seats. ANALYSIS The study group for this report is comprised of 535 accidents involving 1,268 occupants, of which 391 accidents resulted in at least one fatality. In these 391 accidents, there were 859 fatalities, 74 occupants who survived with serious injuries, and 19 occupants who survived with minor or no injuries. All occupants were fatally injured in 85 percent of the 391 fatal crashes. In 144 accidents in which no one was fatally injured, 228 occupants were seriously injured and 87 occupants received minor injuries. One occupant's injuries could not be determined. The analysis for this study group is presented in two sections: first, impact severity is discussed in terms of impact angles and impact speeds, and the impact severity envelope (referred to in this report as the survivable envelope) is determined for survivable accidents. Second, the potential for injury prevention, made possible by shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats, is presented. IMPACT SEVERITY - Impact severity was defined in terms of impact angle and impact speed, the most readily available parameters that can be related to the survivability of an accident. Each accident was determined to be survivable or nonsurvivable, and, for most of the accidents, impact speeds and impact angles were estimated. After the impact severity estimates were made, each accident and occupant were represented on the polar plots. The impact severity increases with impact angle because the velocity change during the principal impact becomes greater at increasingly higher impact angles. At shallow impact angles, the airplane "hits and skips" with relatively small velocity changes. At high impact angles, the airplane "hits and sticks," which results in a greater velocity change or a more severe impact. The distributions of impact speeds and impact angles for survivable accidents versus nonsurvivable accidents were compared (see figures 1 and 2). There were a significant number of survivable accidents at impact speeds of less than 90 knots and at impact angles of less than 45 degrees. There were very few survivable accidents outside this range. In contrast, there were proportionally fewer nonsurvivable accidents at impact speeds of less than 90 knots and at impact angles of less than 45 degrees. Figures 1 and 2 were compared to establish whether the difference between survivable accidents and nonsurvivable accidents was one of impact severity. Any difference which could be demonstrated would define the limits of the survivable envelope. First, the density plots of figure 1 and figure 2 were overlayed. In another comparison, the plots were redrawn as rectangular plots so that dot density of various sectors could be directly compared. These rectangular plots also were overlayed for comparison. Comparisons of the dot density of a sector in the low-speed range to the dot density of a sector in the high-speed range can be misleading. For example, in figure 1 between the lines forming the angles of 30 and 45 degrees, the sector between 75 and 90 knots is twice as large as the sector between 30 and 45 knots, even though both represent equal changes in velocity and angle. As a result, the relative dot density for differing impact angles within a given speed range are valid, however, as are comparisons among individual sectors from figure to figure in this report. These comparisons produced a boundary, or visible difference, between the two groups. The difference was most clear as a line which extends from 0 degrees at 75 to 90 knots, to 45 degrees at 60 knots, and to 90 degrees at 60 knots. A special effort was made to evaluate nonsurvivable accidents which fell inside this limit and to evaluate survivable accidents which were outside this limit. Most of the latter accidents differed from the other survivable or nonsurvivable accidents within their respective severity ranges in some of the following ways. In the lower speed, survivable region, nonsurvivable accidents included those involving inverted crashes or direct tree or other object strikes to single occupants. In the high-speed and/or low-angle impact region, a survivable accident would include an airplane cruising into gently rising terrain and sliding over some distance to a stop without generating significant loads. As plotted, an impact angle of 90 degrees appears to be the limit of the survivable envelope for a 60-knot impact. However, examination of the accident reports shows that the survivable impacts plotted in the 45- to 90- degree sector actually are distributed much more closely to the 45-degree line than is shown by the even distribution of the plot. Since the data in that sector are biased more toward the 45-degree line, the survivable impact speed limit at an impact angle of 90 degrees is more nearly 45 knots. Similarly, many accidents in the impact speed range of 75 to 90 knots were only marginally survivable. The survivable occupant density depicted in figure 2 in the 75- to 90- knot sectors probably is actually aligned more closely with the 75-knot limit. 6.47</page><page sequence="8">The resulting boundary of the survivable envelope is depicted in figure 3 by a line from zero degrees at 75 knots, to 45 degrees at 60 knots, and to 90 degrees at 45 knots. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF SHOULDER HARNESSES AND ENERGY-ABSORBING SEATS - In addition to developing data on impact severity, an important part of this study was to assess the magnitude of the benefits that could be expected from the use of shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats. There were five survivable accidents in which shoulder harnesses were worn by only one of two front-seat occupants. A comparison was made of the relative injuries of each occupant. It was found in each case that injury severity was less for the occupant who wore the shoulder harness. The impact angles ranged from near zero degrees to 30 degrees, and impact speeds ranged from 30 to 75 knots. As expected, the higher speeds corresponded to impact angles under 15 degrees, and the higher impact angles (greater than 20 degrees) corresponded to the lower impact speeds. None of the accidents involved post-crash fire. In each of these accidents, the occupant who wore a shoulder harness had fewer and less severe injuries than the occupant who did not. For example, in one accident each of two occupants sustained serious injuries, but the pilot, wearing a shoulder harness, sustained a broken leg and a slight concussion while the passenger without a shoulder harness sustained severe head injuries. The differences in the injuries in these comparisons were related to head and upper body injuries. Those persons who wore shoulder harnesses had markedly fewer head injuries. As would be expected, shoulder harnesses did not prevent injuries to the lower torso or to the extremities. Estimates of Shoulder Harness Benefits - Since this study did not evaluate accidents in which the injury levels were only minor and none, the estimates of shoulder harness benefits presented in this report are conservative. For example, there were a number of severe accidents in the 1982 data base in which occupants received only minor or no injuries, because they were wearing shoulder harnesses. While an analysis of these accidents would have further strengthened this study, there was no timely way to isolate those accidents. Further, the estimates of benefit presented in this report are based on the existing fleet of general aviation airplanes. Any improvements in airframes which are incorporated in the future that will result in improved preservation of the "livable volume" will increase the importance of shoulder harness use. Figure 1. Impact Angles and Speeds Figure 2. Occupants in Nonsurvivable Accidents Figure 3. Survivable Envelope 6.48</page><page sequence="9">871006 There are two important elements which must be satisfied in order to realize the full benefits of shoulder harnesses. First, the shoulder harness must be available for use. Only 40 percent of all airplane occupants examined in this study had shoulder harnesses available. The second element is that of use; a shoulder harness cannot protect an occupant from injury in a crash if it is not being worn. Of the 253 occupants whose shoulder harness use could be determined, only 100 persons, or 40 percent, actually used the available devices. Combining the availability rate (40 percent) and the usage rate (40 percent) indicates that 16 percent of the occupants were wearing shoulder harnesses. Of the occupants examined in this study, 71 percent occupied front seats, and 97 percent of the persons wearing shoulder harnesses were front-seat occupants. This indicates that the use of a shoulder harness is confined almost entirely to front seats. Shoulder harness availability was determined for 771 of the 902 front-seat occupants. Fifty percent of those occupants (382 out of 771) had shoulder harnesses available. Shoulder harness use could be established for 240 of the 382 front- seat occupants. Forty percent of these occupants (97 out of 240) wore their shoulder harnesses. Fewer shoulder harnesses were available for rear seat occupants. Availability was determined for 304 of the 366 rear occupants. Fourteen percent of those occupants (43 out of 304) had shoulder harness available. Shoulder harness use could be established for 13 of the 43 rear seat occupants. Only 23 percent of these occupants (3 out of 13) wore their shoulder harnesses. Many of the occupants who had shoulder harnesses available were not required to wear them. Although crevmembers are required to wear shoulder harnesses for takeoff s and landings, many did not. Some crewmembers forgot to put their shoulder harnesses back on when it became evident that an in-flight emergency would lead to a crash. These issues will be addressed in the next report of this series. Each of the 1,268 occupants was evaluated separately. Potential benefits were established for 1,111 occupants. The potential for benefit for the 157 remaining occupants could not be determined. Detailed data were collected on specific injuries and on the extent to which these injuries either could have been prevented or could have been less serious through the use of a shoulder harness. Of the 859 fatally injured occupants in this study, the potential for benefit of shoulder harnesses could be established for 800 persons. There were 163 occupants who could have survived but did not. It is estimated that at least 13 percent (106) of the 800 fatally injured persons in these accidents would have been injured only seriously if they had been using shoulder harnesses and that an additional 7 percent (57) of the fatally injured persons would have had only minor or no injuries. The expected benefits are even more pronounced for those who were seriously injured. Fully 88 percent (201) of the 229 seriously injured persons who could be evaluated in this study probably would have received less severe head or upper body injuries, only minor injuries, or no injuries at all if shoulder harnesses had been worn. The 163 fatally injured occupants who would not have been injured fatally if a shoulder harness had been worn would have received, instead, serious, minor, or no injuries. Likewise, 180 of the persons (79 percent) who were injured seriously without shoulder harnesses would have had only minor or no injuries with a shoulder harness. As a result, the net change is a 20-percent reduction in fatalities and a 32- percent reduction of serious injuries. In addition to this benefit, 21 persons (9 percent) of the seriously injured occupants in this study, while still expected to have serious injuries even with a shoulder harness, would have had significantly less serious head or chest injuries. The percentage change in benefits of shoulder harness use is not as graphic as would be the case if only survivable accidents are considered. In total, 584 of the fatally injured occupants were removed from the data base because they were involved in nonsurvivable accidents. Thus, in survivable accidents only, shoulder harnesses could have prevented 75 percent (163) of the 216 fatalities, and 79 percent of the 229 serious injuries. Overall, of all occupants of survivable accidents who had fatal or serious injuries, 82 percent could be expected to have received a significant benefit in terms of injury reduction through shoulder harness use. Estimates of Energy-Absorbing Seats Benefits - Energy-absorbing seats cannot be expected to prevent many fatalities since the predominant injuries which they can prevent are spinal injuries. These injuries rarely result in a fatality except when they prevent timely egress. However, they usually are severe, long-lasting, and costly. Evaluation of the data in this study indicated that about 2 percent of the fatalities could have been prevented if energy-absorbing seats had been available. Many serious back and neck injuries can be prevented if vertical energy management is considered during seat design. This study found that about 34 percent of the occupants who had serious injuries could be expected to have had significantly fewer serious injuries if they had been seated in energy- absorbing seats. 6.49</page><page sequence="10">An important consideration in achieving these potential benefits is that, in order for an energy-absorbing seat to provide occupant protection, the occupant must remain in an upright position and the seat must remain in place. This means that the occupant must be restrained by a lapbelt and shoulder harness. Installation of improved seats, in the absence of shoulder harness use, will not produce the improvement noted above. Moreover, it is important to note that nearly 27 percent of the seats in survivable accidents did not remain attached. When a seat does not remain securely attached to the floor, occupant injury protection offered either by the seat or by the lapbelt and shoulder harness is considerably reduced. To summarize the benefits that could be expected from the use of shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats, it was established that 20 percent of all fatalities could have been prevented by the use of shoulder harnesses and that 91 percent of the seriously injured occupants could have had less serious head, upper body, and/or back injuries with the use of shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats combined. Shoulder harnesses alone could have prevented or minimized the severity of the head and upper body injuries for 88 percent of the seriously injured occupants; energy- absorbing seats could have prevented or minimized the severity of back injuries for 34 percent of the seriously injured occupants. CONCLUSIONS 1. Shoulder harness use is the most effective method of reducing fatal and serious injuries in general aviation airplane accidents. 2. New crashworthy airframe design is the improvement which will most significantly expand the survivable envelope to higher impact speeds. 3. Impact severity, as defined by impact speed and impact angle, is a principal determinant of a survivable accident. 4. The accidents reviewed in this study generally were survivable within the envelope bounded by a line through an impact speed of 45 knots at an impact angle of 90 degrees, 60 knots at 45 degrees, and 75 knots at zero degrees. 5. A potential 20-percent reduction in fatalities could be realized if all occupants of general aviation airplanes were to wear shoulder harnesses. 6. Potentially, 88 percent of seriously injured occupants could be expected to incur significantly reduced injuries if shoulder harnesses were used. 7. A potential 2-percent reduction in fatalities could be realized with the installation of energy-absorbing seats. 8. Potentially, 34 percent of seriously injured occupants could be expected to have significantly reduced injuries if energy- absorbing seats were available. 9. Where shoulder harness availability and use could be determined, only 16 percent of the occupants were wearing a shoulder harness at the time of the crash. Shoulder harnesses were available to 40 percent of the occupants and, when available, were worn 40 percent of the time. 10. Twenty-seven percent of all seats in survivable accidents underwent some type of failure. PHASE THREE ACCELERATION LOADS AND VELOCITY CHANGES OF SURVIVABLE ACCIDENTS Over the years, many studies and dynamic tests have been conducted which attempted to define the limits of human tolerance to abrupt acceleration. Many of these studies used automobile crash data, which describe primarily single-axis loading (longitudinal). Automobile crashes also are of relatively low energy compared to airplane crashes. In the dynamic tests, the live occupants were completely restrained, including their limbs, which allowed them to sustain greater acceleration loads than could be tolerated by occupants restrained only by a lapbelt and single-shoulder harness. Also, most of these tests with live occupants used a single-axis load application and were stopped at a point where the loads approached the limits of pain or reversible injury. The conclusions from these studies and tests have helped define the limits of human tolerance to abrupt acceleration, but they do not describe adequately the severe but survivable crash environment of general aviation airplanes. Unlike many automobile crashes or the tests performed as a part of studies, airplane crashes are high-energy crashes which generate acceleration loads that can considerably exceed the limits of pain or reversible injury, and which act along many axes simultaneously. The restraint systems that are and will be used in general aviation in the future cannot approach the capabilities of the totally restrictive restraints that have been used in the dynamic tests with live occupants. Instead, the restraints of choice probably will be the lapbelt and the single, diagonal shoulder harness, comparable to those used in automobiles. Since existing data defining the limits of human tolerance to abrupt accelerations do not adequately represent the crash environment of small airplanes, the Safety Board examined a number of general aviation airplane crashes in an 6.50</page><page sequence="11">871006 attempt to define the limits of likely peak acceleration loads and velocity changes of survivable crashes. It is important to note that the occupant tolerance to acceleration, as presented in this study, may apply only to general aviation airplane crashes, with the limiting factors being the crashworthiness of the fuselage structure and the multi-axis loading on the occupants. SUMMARY OF RESULTS - Analysis of the selected 39 general aviation airplane crashes revealed that survival could be expected in crashes in which the longitudinal acceleration loads were in the 30 to 35 G range, with a velocity change of 60 to 70 feet per second. In the vertical direction, the acceleration loads were in the 25 to 30 G range with a velocity change to 50 to 60 feet per second. There are significant differences in how the longitudinal and vertical loads affect the occupant. An occupant can withstand a 30 to 35 G longitudinal load and sustain only minor injuries, as long as the severity of the secondary impact into the instrument panel or other objects is limited. In the vertical direction, the occupant can survive the 25 to 30 G load, but usually sustains severe injury to the back or neck (paraplegic or quadriplegic injuries). Thus, the vertical loads must be attenuated to a greater degree than the longitudinal loads if the occupant is to escape major crippling injuries. The impact scenarios described in this study conform to the basic definition of a survivable crash. However, certain design factors limit the ability of current airplane structures to provide crash protection. These include (1) the present shoulder harness systems which cannot preclude occupant contact with the instrument panel in the more severe accidents; and (2) the airplane structure which cannot absorb relatively high crash loads without collapsing, thus limiting the occupi able area that protects the occupant. The next major advance in crashworthiness protection may well come from more effective fuselage design. (7) SELECTIVITY - Accidents selected for this study were severe, but survivable. One guideline used for the selection of accidents was that the accident had to have a serious or fatal injury and had to have at least one survivor. Accidents involving fire were rejected unless the fire was very minor. Crashworthiness investigations were conducted on 39 accidents, one of which was determined to be nonsurvivable. Nineteen accidents had at least one fatality and 18 accidents had no fatalities but had one or more seriously injured occupants. In two accidents, the occupants had only minor injuries, but these accidents were included because of the severity of the impact. METHODOLOGY - The methodology described briefly here and more completely in the Phase One report was used to calculate acceleration loads and velocity changes. Data were evaluated that led to conclusions about impact angles, impact speeds, and stopping distances for the airplanes. Acceleration loads and velocity changes were calculated when sufficient data existed. When a range of values was possible for a parameter, the most conservative values were used. This established minimum acceleration loads for those cases in which more precise acceleration loads could not be calculated. In many of these cases, even the conservative acceleration loads greatly exceeded the current FAA design requirement of 9 G's. VALIDITY OF DATA BASE - It was important to establish that the accidents used for this study represented the more severe, survivable general aviation accidents so that the upper bounds of the survivable envelope could be better defined. To test the selection process, the data in this Study were compared to the data presented in the Phase Two report. The impact angles and impact speeds of the accidents that were selected for this study were compared to the NASA crash test data and the 1982 NTSB data that was the basis for the Phase Two report. It was determined that the 39 accidents represented severe, but survivable general aviation crashes. A second comparison between the Phase Two and Phase Three data was made showing the relative availability and use of shoulder harnesses and energy-absorbing seats and the potential reduction in injuries through their use. The two data sets compared favorably. Although qualitative in nature, a third comparison of both the airplane damage and general injury level of the two sets of accidents was made. The amounts and types of damage to each airplane and the severity of injuries to the occupants in the Phase Three data set were found to be consistent with the Phase Two data set. EVALUATION OF THE ACCELERATION AND VELOCITY CHANGE Longitudinal Acceleration and Velocity Changes -- Acceleration loads and velocity changes are expressed in relation to the airplane's axes. They could not be calculated for all cases because of missing data, such as impact velocity, stopping distances, and/or long slides after impact. The upper limit of the range of acceleration loads in these survivable accidents is 30 to 35 G's and the upper limit of the range of velocity change is 60 to 70 feet per second. In two cases, the velocity changes were over 80 feet per second, but they were not typical cases. In one case, the airplane flew into a grove of trees, came to a stop, and remained suspended in the trees with no injury to the 6.51</page><page sequence="12">occupant. The second case involved a straight- down impact which was nonsurvivable for the front seat occupants because of the crushing. Based on the extent of airframe damage and the severity of injuries, velocity changes greater than 60 feet per second were judged to approach the upper limits of survivability. In the most severe of the survivable cases, shoulder harness use did not always prevent the occupants from contacting the instrument panel. Because of inadequate shoulder harness adjustment and material stretch, either the occupants were able to move forward too far, or severe airframe crushing caused the instrument panel to move aft a significant distance, thus compromising the potential of shoulder harness use. VERTICAL ACCELERATION AND VELOCITY CHANGES -The vertical acceleration loads and velocity changes that were calculated for 12 of the 39 accidents. Acceleration loads or velocity changes could not be calculated for all cases because of missing data, such as impact velocity and/or impact angle. The upper limit of the range of survivable acceleration loads approached 25 to 30 G's and the corresponding velocity changes were in the 50 to 60 feet per second range. For two of the cases in which energy- absorbing seats were used, acceleration levels were calculated for both the fuselage and the occupants. The occupant acceleration calculations are identical to the fuselage acceleration calculations except that the stopping distance of the occupant is increased by the stroking distance of the seat; this decreases the acceleration level of the occupants. In one case, the seat stroked about 6 inches, decreasing the acceleration level of the occupant from 24 G's to 18 G's. In another case, both seats stroked their full travel of about 1 foot. This decreased the acceleration level of a 180-pound occupant from about 36 G's to 18 G's. The seat did not bottom out and therefore safely dissipated the occupant's energy. However, the other occupant, a 270- pound male, sustained fatal spine/skull injuries when his seat bottomed out against the floor, creating a large, fatal acceleration spike. Thus, the weight of an occupant in an energy-absorbing seat is an important factor in the amount of protection provided by the seat. This relationship can be described as follows. An energy-absorbing seat should stroke at a constant force exerted by the occupant. A seat that strokes at 2,000 pounds would be a 20 G seat for a 100-pound occupant (2,000/100) and it would be a 10 G seat for a 200-pound occupant. A seat that can stroke 1 foot at 2,000 pounds can slow a 100-pound occupant from 36 feet per second to zero feet per second, but that same seat can slow a 200- pound occupant only from 36 feet per second to 25 feet per second. The seat dissipated most of the energy of the lighter occupant, whereas the heavier occupant still was moving at a relatively high velocity when the seat's stroking capability was expended and he contacted the floor. OCCUPANT INJURY AND SEAT/RESTRAINT SYSTEM DESIGN With a single exception, all of the crashes discussed in the Phase Three report were survivable. In some of those cases, the occupants were provided good crash protection by properly designed seats and restraints. Those seat/restraint systems greatly exceeded the current design requirements of the Federal regulations. However, many occupants were needlessly injured because seat/restraint systems either were not able to structurally withstand the crash loads, shoulder harnesses were not available, or they were not used. Most of those injuries could have been prevented if the seat/restraint systems had been built to withstand more realistic dynamic crash loads, or if the occupants had used shoulder harnesses. During the investigations of these accidents, many seat and restraint problems were documented. These included problems with seat strength, seat feet design, lack of energy absorption capability, inadequately designed seat pans, lack of shoulder harness installation or use, and equipment that was added to seats. Another recurring factor was failure to use the installed shoulder harnesses. RESTRAINTS-SHOULDER HARNESS AND LAPBELTS In survivable accidents, the most commonly seen injuries of a severe nature are to the head or upper torso. The Phase Two report established that 20 percent of the fatally injured and 88 percent of the seriously injured occupants had serious but preventable head and upper body injuries and that only 16 percent of the occupants were wearing shoulder harnesses. Almost all case studies in this report show examples of head and upper body injuries that could have been prevented with the use of upper body restraints. Shoulder harness use not only prevents or minimizes head and upper body injury, but the harness can redistribute a large portion of the crash loads to the upper body so that the lapbelt and pelvic loads are less. High lapbelt loads can cause pelvic and internal injuries. In many cases, shoulder harnesses were not worn by the occupants for one of two reasons, either they were not available or passengers were not required to wear them. The Phase Two report established that shoulder harnesses were available only in 40 percent of the front seats of the general aviation airplanes examined and that they were almost nonexistent in rear seats. 6.52</page><page sequence="13">871006 Further, only 40 percent of the occupants were wearing their available harnesses when an accident occurred. Several pilots who were wearing their restraints for takeoff stated that they removed the shoulder harness portion of the restraint after the takeoff was completed. When an emergency occurred, they did not remember to put the harness back on. In four other accidents in which shoulder harnesses were not available, rear seat occupants sustained fatal injuries because of head strikes or fractured or dislocated cervical vertebrae which could have been avoided if shoulder harnesses had been available and worn. Shoulder harnesses provide additional protection during an accident. Without a shoulder harness, the entire occupant load is carried by the lapbelt. That can create excessive belt loads to the pelvic and abdominal regions of the body. Occupants received injuries consistent with high lapbelt loads. Typical injuries were fractures of the pelvis, tears of internal organs, and tears of the soft tissue in the lower abdominal area. In survivable crashes, restraint systems sometimes separate because they are required only to meet the static test loads described in 14 CFR Part 23. The more severe, survivable crashes generate forces that easily can exceed these levels by a factor of two or three. One case involved a Piper Model PA32 airplane that used cables to attach the rear lapbelts to the floor. Two of the cables broke, causing the occupants to sustain more serious injuries than expected. In 1973, the Safety Board issued to the FAA Safety Recommendation A-73-59 recommending that it require the owners to replace the existing lapbelt attachment cables with stronger cables. It was believed that the cable was under-designed and that extra stresses were imparted to the cable as it bent around the seat frame. The FAA declined to implement the recommendation, stating that the crash exceeded the design standards applicable to that airplane. Shortly after this accident, another crash occurred involving a Piper airplane in which the rear lapbelt cable broke. The occupant, who was not restrained because the cable broke, probably sustained more serious injuries than if the lapbelt had held. All of the cables that broke were 1/8 inch in diameter and were in airplanes manufactured before 1973, the year Piper upgraded to a 3/16- inch cable. Each cable exhibited signs of breaking due to static overload and additionally, one cable was corroded. The corrosion weakened that cable, but it still would have met the current design requirements. Cable breaks and lapbelt separations typically have not been a problem in survivable crashes in which other designs have been used. In another case, the pilot's lapbelt attachment separated, allowing the occupant to hit the panel with his whole body. The bolt that holds the attachment in place was pulled out when the cabin deformed, causing the fitting to twist and shear the attachment bolt. SEATS AND RESTRAINTS-DYNAMIC TESTING Design and test requirements for general aviation seats are not adequate because the required static test procedures do not adequately prove the capabilities of the seat/restraint designs. Seats that meet the current requirements may offer little protection in a crash because they are understrength or they may not perform properly in an actual crash environment. It was found that present test load applications are not realistic and that the design load requirements are too low. For example, a seat with the lapbelt attached to the floor may weight about 20 pounds, thus requiring a static pull test of 180 pounds to the seat (9 G's times 20 pounds). The body block, on the seat and restrained by a belt, would be subjected to a force of (9 times 170) 1,530 pounds. The test requirements also allow simultaneous forward and upward loads, which prevent the body block from pushing down on the seat in a manner more representative of an actual airplane impact condition. In an actual crash, a seat may come off the tracks or may break at less than 9 G's since the body normally moves down and forward during a crash. When this happens, the seatpan deflects, allowing the pelvis to move below the seatframe which causes the body's weight to load the front of the seat (1,530 pounds at 9 G's). This event can occur even before the lapbelt restraint becomes effective. This scenario causes the seat to be loaded quickly in excess of its 180-pound design limit; the seat, therefore, is most likely to break or separate from its tracks. Another problem typically encountered in crashes, and which is not accounted for in current design practices, is overshoot. Overshoot is a phenomenon in which the occupant acceleration is greater than the airplane crash acceleration. Overshoot occurs when the occupant is accelerated and then stopped abruptly by the lapbelt or shoulder harness; it is similar to the high occupant acceleration loads being generated by secondary impacts into the instrument panel. A seat/restraint system can be tested to 9 G's equivalent static load, but in an actual 9 G crash, overshoot may generate loads that are 1.5 to 3 times greater, significantly greater than the static test loads. This problem is more severe for systems that have the restraints attached to the seats. The extra loads created by overshoot may cause the entire seat/restraint/occupant system to become detached from the airplane structure. To be assured that 6.53</page><page sequence="14">a seat/ restraint system meets any prescribed load, the system must be dynamically tested, and the loads applied in proper directions. Because shoulder harnesses are optional, seats and lapbelts in combination or of themselves must accommodate the loads prescribed by 14 CFR 23.561. However, since a shoulder harness can transfer large loads directly to the fuselage, it is possible that, in a particular seat/lapbelt/shoulder harness system, the shoulder harness could carry a large portion of the prescribed 9 G load. When the installation and use of shoulder harnesses are made mandatory, designers will be in a position to reduce the strength of the seat/lapbelt combination and meet the standard on the basis that the combined seat/1 apbelt/harness system accommodates the prescribed load. For instance, for certification purposes as a 9 G system, a lapbelt could be designed to sustain a 6 G load and the shoulder harness could be designed to sustain the remaining 3 G load. At least one manufacturer designed and tested a seat using multiple loads and later found that a single axis forward pull test would fail the seat. Rather than redesign the seat, the solution was to require the use of a shoulder harness and use the contribution of the shoulder harness to meet the 9 G requirement. When shoulder harness use is not required or when the crew or passengers forget to put the harnesses back on during an emergency, a 6 G seat does not offer the expected protection. The Safety Board believes that the seat/lapbelt combination of itself should continue to be required to handle the prescribed load, as should the entire seat/lapbelt/shoulder harness system. SEAT FEET AND SEAT LEGS - Many of the seats in the general aviation fleet break or come off the tracks during survivable crashes. The cases in this study showed that 44 percent of the occupied seats became detached from the airplane structure, usually because the seat feet or legs broke or separated. In one case, a seat came loose, which allowed the occupant, who had survivable injuries, to fall out of the airplane and drown in shallow water. Had the seat remained in place, the occupant would have been held in place by the lapbelt. In another case, the seat frame strength was inadequate. There were no braces between the front and aft legs of the seat and since the front legs had adjustment pins in the tracks, they resisted all of the forward loads exerted on the seat during the crash. As the seat was forced to move forward, the frame bent allowing the rear legs to move closer to the front legs. When the frame broke, the rear legs were free to move forward on the tracks until they contacted the front legs. During this process, the rear of the seat rotated down accelerating the occupant toward the floor. Many of the seats separate because of small side loads to the seat coupled with the warping of the floor and seat tracks. Seat separations because of side loads are directly related to low side load test requirements. The side load requirement of 1.5 G's is totally inadequate. With a misalignment of only 10 degrees, a 9 G forward acceleration can create a side load of 1.5 G to the seat feet. Small side loads can result in seat separation because the seat feet spread. To combat this problem, several manufacturers have added extra structure to the seat foot area. Beech Aircraft has designed an extra bracket for the seat feet in their Model 23 series of airplanes, and Piper Aircraft has recommended adding two large washers to each seat foot in many of the PA-28 series of its airplanes. Floor warping can cause seats to fail. As a floor warps, extra stresses can be placed on the seat feet as the seat resists changing its original shape to accommodate the floor warp. Piper designed an energy-absorbing seat that is flexible in several directions. The seat can stroke vertically, which absorbs energy, but it can distort and twist also without much resistance. With that built-in flexibility, the Piper "S" tube seat can deform to the contour to the floor warp without causing excessive stress on the seat feet. Other cases involved seats that were struck by the occupants who were seated directly behind them. When a seat is struck from behind, it has to carry the loads of its own occupant and the additional loads of the occupant behind. This type of extra loading is not considered in any current design practice. Multi-axis dynamic testing of seats can uncover these types of design problems. Higher strength requirements would ensure that the seats would not break when exposed to minor loads. ENERGY-ABSORBING SEATS Ł Energy-absorbing seats Ł are needed to dissipate excess energy and prevent lower back and pelvic injuries. The Phase Two report concluded that 34 percent of all seriously injured occupants could be expected to have had significantly less serious injuries if energy- absorbing seats had been installed. Twenty-nine of the occupants in this study (24 percent of the total occupants) did benefit or would have benefited from the use of energy-absorbing seats. An allowance for vertical stroking distance is à primary requirement if an energy-absorbing seat is to perform its function. Little or no room is provided for vertical stroking of the back seats in some of the smaller general aviation airplanes. Many of the rear seats are mounted on the floorboards so that the occupant is seated only in inch or two above solid structure. In one case, a 3/4-inch plywood floor 6.54</page><page sequence="15">871006 covered several inches of space that was available for stroking. During the high vertical loading experienced in this accident, the occupant bottomed out on the plywood floor and sustained a broken back. In another case, the second row of seats was placed on structure that houses components of the air conditioning system. There was no room for the seatpan to move down, and the occupant bottomed out on the structure, sustaining a broken back. Only one seat in general aviation airplanes is designed as an energy- absorbing seat. The Piper "S" tube seat offers a significant amount of protection by absorbing energy in a controlled manner as it deforms and deflects toward the floor. This seat was dynamically tested to fine tune its energy absorption characteristics. There are other seats designed in the early 1960 1 s that can absorb energy, even though that was not a part of the design criteria. For instance, the front seats in the Beech Sport/Sundowner series airplanes, can absorb significant crash loads. SEATPAN DESIGN - One of the least discussed components in seat/restraint system design is the seatpan. The seatpan can perform the important function of absorbing energy in the vertical direction through deflection or by transmitting the occupant loads to the seat frame. However, design requirements for the seatpan are almost nonexistent. There were seatpans that separated incrementally, absorbing energy in the process. They consisted of formed aluminum sheets that were attached to the steel tube seat frames by rivets. As the pilot and copilot moved downward, the aluminum seatpans began to tear away from the rivets sequentially. Although the seats did not stroke, the tearing seatpans increased the stopping distance of the crewmembers in a relatively controlled manner, which resulted in less severe acceleration loads on their spines. Seatpans can tear in a catastrophic manner. In one case, they separated, causing the occupants to bottom out on the floor. The tie-wires that stabilize the seatpan springs came detached and allowed the springs to spread apart. The occupants moved down through the springs to the floor. In another case, the nylon fabric seatpan tore, allowing the occupant to contact the floor. During the investigation, a small tear was found in the seatpan of the unoccupied right front seat. By pulling at the tear with one finger, the tear was propagated along one side of the seatpan. The material appeared to be strong, but the tear resistance was minimal while the material was under tension, acting as a diaphragm. Once the material was torn enough to ease the tension, it could no longer be torn by hand. It is believed that the loads on the occupied seat were high and that a tear started in the pan and propagated with little resistance. Another seatpan exhibited characteristics similar to the ones discussed above. The seat was over air conditioning ducting which limited vertical movement. However, there were two small holes in the nylon mesh seatpan. During the investigation, the seatpan was torn by pulling at the holes with a finger. The pan could be torn in that manner until it no longer was in tension. The seatpans in another case presented additional problems. The pans were made from a neoprene material that had deteriorated with age. Although the crash generated relatively minor loads in the vertical direction, the seatpans had separated at the steel fittings and were held in place only by the foam rubber comfort cushions. The Safety Board believes that more stringent design requirements, such as dynamic testing, would have precluded the production of these poor seatpan designs. Evaluation of the rip-stop capabilities of seatpan material may be in order, as would be an evaluation of the effects of seatpan deterioration with age. SEAT ADD-ONS - Present general aviation airplane seats generally do not exceed greatly the minimum FAA strength requirements and they do not offer much protection to occupants in more than a minor crash. Attaching additional equipment to the seat adds extra weight and further degrades their protection capabilities. There were cases where equipment had been added to the seats. One oxygen bottle supplier advertises oxygen bottle holders that can hang over the backs of the front seats. These holders have three negative aspects: first, the system can add as much as 20 pounds, which decreases the seat's G-load capabilities. Second, the positioning is dangerous because, in a crash, the bottle could drive into the head or back of the front seat occupant. Third, a rear seat occupant could pitch forward and contact the unpadded bottle. The drilling or modification of a seat frame is another problem related to adding equipment to seas. Field modification procedures that are acceptable for other airplane structures are not acceptable for seats. This is because the stresses and load paths in seat structures are far more complicated than on other airplane structures on which field modifications are permitted. Any modifications to seat structures should comply with the more rigorous requirements that apply to the primary airplane structure, such as wing spars or engine mounts. The drilling of holes or other modifications of seats have been demonstrated by dynamic testing to have potentially disastrous effects. Attaching or storing objects under a seat also may prevent a seat from stroking in the vertical direction, thus negating any potential 6.55</page><page sequence="16">energy-absorbing benefits that the seat might provide. For example, fire extinguishers are often stored under the front seats which results in a reduction of the seat stroking distance by as much as four inches. Improper seat modifications or seats in poor repair can be overlooked by a mechanic. In one, the seatpans had been removed and replaced with lawnchair webbing which was fastened with the kind of staples used for paper. Deteriorated seatpans were not discovered during normal inspections. Analysis of the material indicated that the deteriorated condition of the seatpan material was of long standing. Although in this study there were no injuries that could be attributed to a seat add-on equipment, the person in the seat with lawn chair webbing did sustain a serious back injury. These problems do not appear widespread; nevertheless, the Safety Board believes that better education of the aviation community about the critical nature of general aviation airplane seats and the need to improve them is warranted. VALIDITY OF THE GASP PROPOSAL Beginning in July 1983, the GASP held a series of meetings to explore general aviation crashworthiness issues. As a result of the meetings, the GASP forwarded a proposal to the FAA on May 2, 1984, that defined standards for seats and restraints. The stated goad was to prevent or reduce airplane crash injuries in a reasonable manner. To ensure that the goal was met, panel members evaluated information presented by experts in such areas as crashworthy seat design, dynamic testing, manufacturing, crashworthiness accident investigation, full scale crash testing, Army helicopter crashworthiness, and human tolerance to vehicle crashes. The main objectives, in order of importance, were to: (1) require dynamic testing that adequately represents an actual crash; (2) increase the strength of the seats and restraints; (3) require energy-absorbing seats to attenuate vertical loads; and (4) establish performance standards by which the tests could be evaluated. Dynamic testing was proposed to ensure proper performance of crashworthy designs that operate in a dynamic environment. Some of the problem areas that are addressed by dynamic testing are dynamic overshoot, floor warping, and secondary head impacts; such testing also validates energy- absorbing devices and defines occupant reactions in the restraint system. A dynamic test load of 26 G's longitudinal with a velocity change of 42 feet per second would result in the design of a high strength seat that would provide protection in severe, but survivable crashes. A 19 G vertical test with a 31-feet-per-second velocity change would dictate that at least some energy management be incorporated into the design. The test criteria, or performance standards, would ensure that the equipment would actually perform as required. The GASP proposal would require the measurement of pelvic loads in order to identify stiff seats. The proposal also would require that shoulder harness loads be limited to prevent injuries to the chest, that the restraint system remain in place and function properly, and for each specific design, that the test determine if head contact is possible with the instrument panel. If head contact is predicted, a second test would quantify the severity of the impact so that corrective actions could be taken. The GASP proposal would require seats to withstand the longitudinal loads generated by a 26 G pulse and a 42 feet-per-second velocity change over a period of 0.1 seconds. Occupants in crashes of less severity than represented by these standards would be well protected. The longitudinal load and velocity change test requirements would be sufficiently rigorous so that the seats and restraints designed to these requirements could protect occupants even in crashes that exceed the velocity change of 42 feet per second, as long as the crash loads were similar to the 26 G test loads. A test involving sufficient energy (velocity change) is important so that the test dummy will become fully engaged in the restraints. In low energy tests (small velocity change), the pelvis and the upper body will not engage the restraints simultaneously. The restraints therefore are not loaded by all parts of the dummy at the same time and a lesser strength restraint system could pass the low energy test. Thus, the test requirement of 42 feet per second longitudinal velocity change would ensure that all parts of the dummy fully engage the restraints at the same time; this would ensure that the seats were truly 26 G seats. Another advantage of a high energy test (dummy fully engaged in the restraint system) is that the proven restraint system theoretically has the capability of sustaining greater velocity changes than those demonstrated in the test as long as the G-loads (forces) remain near the design levels. This means that as long as the acceleration loads are near or below the 26 G test requirement, the velocity change could be much greater than the 42 feet per second without causing the restraint system to break. The only difference is that the restraint system would have to withstand the loads for a longer period of time that for the 0.1 second test requirement. The GASP proposed test loads for the vertical direction purposely were kept lower than optimum because of limiting underseat stroking clearances at certain seat locations. The 19 G load and the 31 feet-per-second velocity change 6.56</page><page sequence="17">871006 were a compromise to ensure that at least some energy management design had to be incorporated into the seats, without forcing some smaller airplane designs from the market. The vertical test would create high vertical loads but still would involve some forward loading that would ensure the stroking mechanism would not bind. To create this combination loading, the test vehicle would be rotated 30 degrees so that the 19 G acceleration load would create resultant vertical load to the seat of 16 G's with a velocity change of 27 feet per second. The longitudinal component would be about 9 G's with a 15 feet-per-second velocity change. Although this test requirement would provide a minimally acceptable level of protection, once energy management (stroking) is introduced into a seat design, the length of the stroke (potential velocity dissipation) will be limited only by the available stroking distance. If the manufacturers use the available space for stroking distance, most passengers will be better protected from vertical loading injuries. A problem in some of the small, two place, general aviation airplanes is that because of the aerodynamic and structural properties of the airplane, the main wing spar is located under the seats. This limits the available stroking distance for the seats. Similarly, in small four place airplanes, the occupi able space for the rear seat occupants is quite limited. In those airplanes, the stroking space for the aft seats can never approach the stroking distance that can be found in some larger four place models. It is important to compare the requirements of the GASP proposal with the real world crash data that form the basis of this report to confirm that the proposed GASP requirements are reasonable and provide proper protection, but not at the expense of requiring over-designed hardware. A comparison is made by evaluating how a seat designed to the GASP requirements would have performed in the crashes that were evaluated in this report. The GASP criteria falls in the middle of the longitudinal acceleration loads and velocity changes of the accidents in this report. It is believed, however, that most of the occupants would have received substantial benefit from a seat/restraint system that was designed to the GASP proposed standards. The accidents which resulted in the higher velocity changes of 60 to 70 feet per second would have had a pulse duration of about 0.17 seconds, 0.07 seconds longer than the test requirement. Experts in the field of dynamic testing of seats/restraint systems believe that the extra time is not critical to the system's capabilities and integrity. It is believed also that the systems could offer substantial protection in the cases where the acceleration levels do not greatly exceed 26 G's, such as those that remain below the 30 G level . It is concluded, therefore, that seat/restraint systems designed to the GASP design criteria for the longitudinal direction would have had enough strength to protect most of the occupants involved in the accident cases used in this study. In the accident cases in which the loads were greater than the test loads recommended by GASP, the occupants still would have received substantial protection. Seats designed to the GASP proposal for the vertical direction would have protected a large number of occupants who were injured. The two accident cases in which energy-absorbing seats were available demonstrate the significant protection that can be provided by energy- absorbing seats. It is recognized that the GASP proposal does not extend to the higher loads which were present in some of the survivable crashes presented in this study. However, it is believed that, in light of cost and other design considerations, the GASP proposal represents a good compromise which should result in less severe injuries to most of the occupants of the more severe, survivable crashes. SUMMARY The Safety Board believes that the GASP proposal provides a method of accomplishing most of the stated Safety Board objectives for newly certificated airplanes. Seats and restraints developed to the GASP proposed standards would offer substantial protection in severe but survivable crashes with the added protection of energy management in the vertical direction. It is recognized that the proposed standards for energy management in the vertical direction are minimal and that even higher standards are desirable where the size of the airplane can accommodate more stroking distance. The mandatory use of shoulder harnesses should be extended to all occupants for takeoff s and landings, and pilots should be discouraged from releasing shoulder harnesses while en route because they may forget or not have time to put them back on during an emergency. Many of the current seat/restraint systems provide only the minimal protection required at the time of the airplane's original certification. It is recognized that, historically, the FAA has not required manufacturers to institute improvements in equipment that meets the original certification standards.. Seat/restraint design, in the view of the Safety Board, is an area where an exception should be made. Additional action is needed to upgrade general aviation seat/restraint designs, particularly where specific weaknesses are 6.57</page><page sequence="18">identifiable, even though the seats or restraints meet the minimum standards required for certification. Throughout the cases in this study, many examples of good seat/restraint designs were found as well as examples of very poor designs. Most of the poor designs easily could have been improved if the designers had had better information on crash dynamics. The Safety Board believes that the broad knowledge available on general aviation crashworthiness must be shared. The exchange of information which has occurred as a result of the meetings of the GASP has been a noteworthy step in the sharing of this knowledge. Further, this mutual effort permitted the formulation of a proposal which was acceptable to all, or nearly all, segments of the aviation community. Efforts of educate designers on the finer points of crashworthiness design include the recent issuance of an Advisory Circular on human tolerance to impact and the FAA's request that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) develop standards for shoulder harness design. CONCLUSIONS 1. The accidents in this study were severe, but survivable, general aviation airplane crashes. 2. Acceleration loads and velocity changes of 30 to 35 G's and 60 to 70 feet per second in the longitudinal direction are generally survivable. 3. Acceleration loads and velocity changes of 25 to 30 G's and 50 to 60 feet per second in the vertical direction are generally survivable but the loads experienced by the occupants must be limited to a lower level to prevent crippling injuries to the back and neck. 4. The impact severities (angles and speeds) of the cases in this study closely match the impact severities of the NASA crash tests. 5. The current seat design requirements of 9 G's forward and 3 to 6 G's downward are inadequate. 6. The practical limits of survivability in general aviation airplane crashes are governed by the type of seat/ restraint systems used and the capability of the fuselage structure to withstand acceleration loads. 7. Based on the results of this study, the GASP recommendation for a dynamic seat/restraint system test to 26 G's and 42 feet per second velocity change longitudinally appears to be reasonable and appropriate.' 8. The GASP recommendation for a dynamic test seat/restraint to 19 G's and 31 feet per second velocity change vertically represents a minimal level of protection, but many occupants will be protected in seats designed to this standard. If the manufacturers also were to use available stroking distances effectively (and thus exceed the GASP requirement), most occupants will be protected in survivable accidents. 9. Many occupants in airplane accidents would derive substantial benefits from seat/restraint systems designed to GASP standards, even if the impact loads were more severe than the prescribed test loads. 10. Head impacts into the instrument panel cannot be precluded, even with properly designed restraint systems. The GASP requirement for the use of a Head Injury Criteria (HIC) test is important, if head impact to the panel is predicted during dynamic testing. 11. In the accidents analyzed as part of this study, over 1/2 of the seats became detached in severe but survivable accidents. Current design requirements call for seat feet to withstand only very low side loads. Floor warpage also causes excessive stresses and separations in the feet of seats that cannot conform to the warpage. 12. Study data indicate that shoulder harnesses are not being used to the fullest extent, even when available. Only crewmembers are required to wear them for takeoff and landing, and many crewmembers fail to do so. In other cases, the occupants released the shoulder harnesses while en route and forgot to put them back on when an emergency arose. 13. Shoulder harness use can reduce the lapbelt loads, preventing many internal organ and pelvic injuries. 14. Shoulder harnesses should not be used to meet the 9 G longitudinal static load requirement for the entire occupant restraint system. Instead, each seat/lapbelt system should be require to restraint he occupant to 9 G's, i.e., the protection of a shoulder harness should be additive. 15. Energy-absorbing seats are necessary to prevent many of the spinal injuries that occur in survivable accidents. 16. Seatpan design requirements are needed to ensure that occupant loads are carried by proper structure. Seatpans should have rip- stop capabilities and should be designed so that they do not collapse catastrophically. 17. For most seats, add-on equipment should be prohibited because the added weight degrades the protection capability of the seat/restraint system. 6.58</page><page sequence="19">871006 18. Energy-absorbing seats, lapbelts, and shoulder harnesses should be designed as an integrated system so that the maximum advantage from each system can be gained. 19. Unique features of some airplane seat/restraint designs can contribute to the failure of the systems at loads that would otherwise be tolerable. For example, seatbelt attachment cables have been shown to be the first element to break in some airplanes. Simple actions to install larger diameter cables would improve the seat strength in these airplanes. 20. Available stroking space must be efficiently utilized and not covered over with flooring and cabinetry materials. POST CRASH FIRE The data contained in the Phase Two study included a total of 128 accidents involving fires. These accidents involved 298 occupants, 249 of whom received fatal injuries. Additionally, at least 13 surviving occupants received serious thermal injuries. Two separate methods of evaluation were used in order to determine whether the crash or the subsequent fire caused the 249 fatalities. The intent was to eliminate nonsurvivable crashes and to identify only those fatalities in which fire rather than impact was the cause of death. In the first method of evaluation, autopsy and impact data of each accident file were examined to determine the survivability of the accident preceding the fire. Less severe impact, soot in the trachea, and/or high carbon monoxide levels in the victims were indicators suggesting that the occupant would have survived if the fire had not occurred. More severe impact, no soot in the trachea, and/or significant blunt trauma injuries were indicative of fatal impact injuries regardless of the severity of subsequent fire injuries. By determining accident survivability with respect to these criteria, it was estimated that 32 to 44 lives could have been saved if fires had been prevented. Additionally, 13 surviving occupants would not have sustained serious thermal injuries as a result of the post-crash fire. In the second method of determining fire related deaths, it was assumed that fires and impact severity were related. That is, it was assumed that the likelihood of encountering a fatality as well as a fire increased with the severity of the impact. The basic 1982 data were divided into four groups of impact severity. Group one (1) impacts were those accidents with impact angles of less than 45 degrees and with impact speeds of less than 75 knots. Group Two (2) impacts included those accidents with less than 45 degree impact angles but with impact speeds greater than 75 knots. Group three (3) included accidents with impact angles greater than 45 degrees and impact speeds of less than 60 knots, and group four (4) accidents included impact angles that were greater than 45 degrees but with impact speeds greater than 60 knots. Within each group, the fatality rate (% fatal) was calculated for fire and non-fire accidents. In the less severe impact groups (1) and (3), the fatality rates were greater when there was a fire. In the more severe impact groups (2) and (4), the fatality rates were similar whether a fire was present or not. This suggests that, in the severe accidents, the crash force is the primary cause of death rather than the fire. This trend also was seen in the analyses conducted using the first evaluation method. The fatality rates of the fire and the non- fire accidents of each severity group can be compared to illustrate the magnitude of the fire problem. For example, Group (3) impacts are at low speed and at steep angles. The fatality rates of fire and non-fire accidents in this group are 82 percent and 70 percent respectively. If it is assumed that the difference in the fatality rates is due to fire, then 12 percent of the occupants suffered a fire death. For Group (3), there were 34 occupants in fire accidents and 12 percent of those, or 4 occupants, would be expected to have been fire deaths. The final results, as seen in Table I, yield an estimated 26 fire deaths for this evaluation method. TABLE I Severity Group Fire Non-Fire (1) ( 64% - 40«) X 72 = 17 (2) ( 87% - 82%) X 76 = 4 (3) ( 82% - 70%) X 34 = 4 (4) (100%) - 99%) X 75 = 1 W The predicted 26 fire deaths are based on 80% of the fire accidents since impact data were not available for the remaining 20%. Correcting the predicted fatalities to the total data base, a total of 32 fire deaths would be expected to have occurred in 1982. In summary, about 14 percent of the fatally injured occupants in fire accidents evaluated above could have survived had there been no fire. That translates to about a 4 percent yearly reduction in fatalities in all general aviation airplane crashes if post-crash fires were prevented in survivable crashes. Additionally, about 26% of the seriously injured occupants in accidents with fire could have been injured less severely had there been no fire which represents about a 6 percent yearly reduction in serious injuries. 6.59</page><page sequence="20">The Safety Board believes that the predicted four percent reduction in fatalities by averting fires is an absolute minimum based on a conservative analysis of the accidents. The anticipated improvements through other crashworthiness rulemaking efforts, such as the addition of dynamically tested seat/shoulder harness systems and energy absorbing seats, may expand the survivable envelope of general aviation airplane accidents so that more occupants will survive the impact. These anticipated improvements will increase the number of occupants who will be exposed to post-crash fires which further warrants rulemaking in this area. REFERENCES 1.
