BALLt Man seems always to have assumed that storms, the fall of rain and snow, and other weather changes were subject to some sort of control.1 From anthropomorphic myth as an explanation, belief and law turned to witchcraft,2 but by the eighteenth century, weather phenomena were ascribed to a Providence whose decisions were legally inscrutable.3 Precipitation fell from the riven sky in expression of the "act of God" and human responsibility extended only to reasonable foresight and precaution, unless a contract of insurance was involved. From Lord Mansfield 4 to present-day judges, events of this kind have been held "not of human origin and not controllable by human power." 5 Each of these varying conceptions reflected accretions to knowledge and t Sterling Fellow, Yale School of Law; Assistant Professor of Law, Ohio State University. 1.

Even recently, experts despaired of intervening in weather changes directly at any distance above the ground, counselling that ".. . we must take our rainfall as it comes. .. ." 7 Weather seemed destined to continue its position as "the most violent variable in man's plans and enterprises." 8 In the past two years, however, a revolution in rainmaking has taken place. Rapid scientific advances in colloid chemistry, meteorology, electronics and other fields have given rise to the assertion that develop- ments in modification of weather phenomena are "possibly as impor- tant, in terms of benefits to mankind, as atomic energy." 9 Icing condi- tions and hailstorms may be eliminated, clouds and fogs dispersed, rain and snow produced, and hurricanes and other rain and snow storms ameliorated or diverted to areas where they will cause little harm. Although the factual future of these discoveries is still in doubt, there is virtual certainty that "sooner or later some cloud sower is going to reap a legal whirlwind." 10 An attempt will be made below to present a preliminary analysis of the legal problems involved in artificial modi- fication or control of the weather, with some suggestions as to the direc- tion which satisfactory solution must take.

When such accounts go further, the temptation to sacrifice thought to humor often leads to vague calls for a "Coordinator of Snowflakes," or a "Secretary of Rain and Snow." This seems a logical point for the writer, also, to drop the eye-catching but discredited misnomer, "rainmaking," in favor of "weather modifica- tion" and "weather control."

If major mistakes in this regard can be avoided, the lawyer's law will not be so awkward and helpless, vis-a-vis technology, as popular statements seem to imply. SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN WEATHER MODIFICATION AND THEIR POSSIBLE APPLICATION The mighty phenomena of weather, covering the globe, represent a precarious balance of enormous forces and masses which may be "triggered" into changing their courses and effects by the application of a relative finger-touch. Colloido-meteorological research would supply the necessary trigger in the form of a nucleation technique which stimulates conversion of the atmosphere's potential energy, stored in unstable air, into the kinetic energy of weather.12 Without this artificial nucleation, thermodynamically unstable conditions may be checkmated by colloidal stability, and, therefore, pass on or dissipate without having produced the weather benefits of which they are cap- able; or they may become intensified until the ultimate spontaneous outbreak is vastly harmful.l3 A necessary prerequisite to the channeling of weather phenomena into desired paths by means of nucleation is a proper understanding of the changes involved in the condensation and sublimation 14 of water vapor and its precipitation.l5 It had long been known that even 11. The term nucleus is used herein not in the special sense of the central portion of an atom, but in the more general meaning of a central mass, or kern, about which matter is gathered. Nucleation refers to the generation or introduction of such nuclei and the immediate effects thereof. For other suggested, though lesser-known techniques, see note 54 infra. 12. See Bergeron, On the Physics of Cloud and Precipitation, MEM.DE L'UNION GEODESIQUE ET GEOPHYSIQUE INT. (1933); Findeisen, Die Kolloidmeteorologischen Vorgange bei der Niederschlagsbildung, 55 Meteorologische Zeitschrift 121 (1938). In his concluding section Findeisen said (at 133) [translation is the present writer's]: ". . every substantial rain is triggered [auslosen] by sublimation and . . . the sublima- tion nuclei play a decisive role .... Something that seems very insignificant from a quantitative point of view, and that has not until now been considered in weather analysis, is decisive for the whole development of the weather. . . . One dares say that it will in time be possible by relatively small efforts to create rain artificially, and to remove the danger of icing and hail. By the energy transformations caused by such a procedure, other aspects of the weather also, e.g. temperature and wind, will, within limits, be influenced, which probably could never be changed directly to any considerable extent by direct technical means." 13.

This is due to the fact that spontaneous cyrstallization occurs only at about minus 35 degrees; only if sublimation nuclei are present can ice crystals grow at higher temperatures. Until very recently, no economically feasible means of causing crystallization on a large scale was known. By 1946, however, the researches of Langmuir and Schaeffer-first on smoke generators and later on aircraft icing 16-had borne fruit. They dis- covered that solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) will spontaneously generate ice nuclei in supercooled clouds, through localized chilling of the air surrounding the dry ice. With Vonnegut's aid, they also learned that chemicals whose crystal structures and molecular dimensions suffi- ciently resemble that of ice will act as sublimation nuclei; the chemical now in use is silver iodide. A very small quantity of either "dry ice" or silver iodide, properly dispensed, will turn the supercooled cloud into unusually minute ice crystals, thus preventing or at least delaying ordinary precipitation. A still smaller quantity begins a normal precipitation process and the moisture falls from the cloud as snow. If relative humidity below the cloud is not too low, the snow will reach the ground. If temperatures above freezing are encountered, the form of the precipitation will be rain.17 At first, it was thought that only clouds which possessed supercooled (2d ed. 1943); BYERS, GENERAL METEOROLOGY CC. 14, 20, 22, 23 (1944).

The process may be roughly described as a "chain reaction," in which droplets grow to critical size and, before falling out of the cloud, shed smaller droplets which repeat the process.18 Use of aircraft, rockets and other carriers for dry ice, and of ground generators for silver iodide will permit large sections of the atmosphere to be seeded and modified by means of the techniques outlined above. The ultimate extent to which weather control can be utilized is rendered speculative by the presently small number of expertly con- ducted field experiments in most forms of applied weather modifica- tion, and by the difficulties of proper instrumentation of even small scale operations. As a result, forethought on legalities must proceed upon the predictions of those conversant with the factual field. There is conflict in these predictions; but to obtain a wide scope, we must here focus upon the affirmative views.19 Upon this basis, some detailing of possible applications of the discoveries already outlined is necessary if the social and economic factors which press toward early develop- ment and utilization of them, or of other methods, are to be grasped. Some idea of the economic interests involved may be gathered from the estimate of savings made possible by present United States Weather Bureau services, which make no effort to change weather but merely give information about it. Its reports have resulted in annual avoid- ance of two billion dollars worth of property damage by agriculture, industry, business, commerce and utilities; and the value of increased production made possible by weather forecasts is another two billions 18.

For a negative view, after a series of experiments by the Cloud Physics Project of the armed services and the Weather Bureau directed toward the "rainmaking" aspect of weather control, see Time, December 6, 1948, p. 50. The official report is quoted as saying: "The responsible scientists of the project interpret the long series of experiments to mean that recently proposed artificial weather modification processes are of relatively little economic importance." How many of the applications other than production of rain were attempted is not indicated in Time's report.

This does not include savings to air commerce, which are "incalculable but large." 20 The specific applications described below were selected on an eclectic basis, without any attempt made to order them according to impor- tance or to be exhaustive. Most of them have been pointed out in general by the researchers, and the intention here is to collate expres- sions of view and locate them in a statistical context. Storm modification THUNDERSTORMS. Recent research makes it seem probable that if dry ice is dropped over incipient thunderstorms as soon as the cloud tops reach freezing level, the development of the storm may be pro- foundly modified. Storms would be longer but less severe, and hail would be avoided.21 The value of such results, although difficult to estimate precisely, may be gauged by the fact that three-fourths of the United States have thunderstorms on an average of 30 or more days annually, the southeast quarter ranging from 50 to 90 days.22 Non-tornadic storms caused an average of 217 deaths and almost $33,000,000 of property damage annually from 1916 to 1941,23 and much of this loss was due to thunderstorm squalls.24 Tornadoes, which develop under "thundery" conditions, caused an average of 239 deaths and $11,000,000 of damage in each year of the same period.25 Aside from the harm done by hail and lightning, the hazard to air commerce created by thunderstorms is common knowledge. 20.

As to air com- merce compare Lederer, Loss Programs of Civil Aviation, reported in Aeron.Eng.Rev., March, 1948, p. 27: "The outstanding factor in producing fatal or potentially fatal air- line accidents over a period of years is the error made in approach and landing during poor weather conditions. If this factor were eliminated about 40 percent of fatal or potentially fatal airline accidents would go with it." Some technicians regard "the cur- rent solution of all weather flying and consequent improvement in the dependability of schedules as the first task confronting the airlines today...."

(Although called "local," in the United States it may "travel a few hundred miles and affect a few thou- sand square miles," Visher, Thunderstorms, 66 SCI.MON. 335, 336 (1948)). But there seems no reason why it may not apply, with some qualification, to other intra-air mass and frontal thunderstorms. Attempts to break heat waves by inducing thundershowers are noted infra. 22. Visher, Thunderstorms, 66 SCI.MON. 335, 337 (1948). The map at 339 gives month-frequencies. 23.

This phenomenon of thunderstorms occurs almost everywhere in the United States, but most frequently on the Great Plains where an average of one thunderstorm in ten is accompanied by hail. In the country as a whole, annual hail damage was $13,300,000 in the years 1916 to 1941.26 As already indicated, nucleation techniques applied to incipient thunderstorms could eliminate hail.27 b. Lightning. The "hammer of Thor" causes 700 to 800 deaths and twice as many personal injuries, plus fire damage of $12,000,000 each year.28 Since lightning results from the vigorous convection of thunder- storm cells, it seems likely that modification of the storms' severity could reduce lightning damage. SNOWSTORMS. In addition to the more obvious damage caused by snowstorms, they give rise to one form of indirect economic loss-the expense of snow removal-which is of substantial importance in urban and industrial areas, especially railroad yards and airports. For exam- ple, snow removal costs New York City about $4,000,000 a year,29 and clearing the abnormal snow of December 26, 1947 alone cost over $6,600,- 000, the snow and ice cover meanwhile causing 2,641 cases of personal injury and property damage.30 It has been suggested that snowstorms may be "triggered off" earlier in time than they would naturally have occurred, thus causing the fall to take place away from urban and industrial areas; 31 or that a change of direction might be induced.32 26. HEWSON AND LONGLEY, METEOROLOGY, THEORETICAL AND APPLIED 376 (1944). METEOROLOGICAL YEARBOOK: 1941 14 (U.S.Wea.Bur. 1943). A single hailstorm may cause almost incredible damage; on July 21, 1947, one moving over a path 5 to 13 miles wide through three Nebraska counties caused estimated losses of $3,000,000 in 90 min- utes. 75 MON.WEA.REV. 135 (1947). 27. FIRST CIRRUS REPORT 11; Visher, Thunderstorms, 66 SCI.MON. 335, 340 (1948): "Indeed it is scientifically highly probable that dry ice dropped into a thunderhead from which damaging hail is falling will cause a reduction of the hail. This is because the dry ice produces a more simple reaction, not the convectional turmoil characteristic of a hail- storm." 28. TREWARTHA, op. cit. supra note 15, at 290. 29.

As to this hastening process, see FIRST CIRRUS REPORT 9, and New York Times, November 15, 1946, p. 25, col. 6. Similar considerations would apply to rain, but in either case, if the storm is frontal or caused by other large scale conditions, operations would apparently have to be continued as long as protection were desired, in some cases for days.

These tropical cyclones caused property damage amounting to $150,000,000 in 1944, $80,000,000 in 1945, $10,000,000 in 1946 and $135,000,000 in 1947-all in addition to considerable loss of lives.35 The types of destruction, including that from gale winds, waves driven onshore, excessive rain and associated floods, are familiar. There is general agreement that the sustaining energy of the developed tropical cyclone is the latent heat released by condensation and precip- itation occurring within it.36 This fact raises the probability that nucleation techniques may, by modifying precipitation, dissipate in- cipient or possibly even developed hurricanes; or, by disturbing their equilibria, change their tracks. Refinements may make this tech- nique practicable within one or two years.37 An experiment in the effect of nucleation techniques upon a hurricane, conducted in 1947 by the armed forces' weather control research organization, Project Cirrus, will be discussed in detail later.

From the Pacific Coast to the crests of the Sierra-Cascade Barrier, the climate is summer-dry; thence east to roughly the 97th meridian it is continuously deficient in rainfall; and the interior subhumid states become dry or semi-arid in one to ten out of twenty years.

Damage done by major droughts is so great and so wide-spread as to be almost incalculable. One estimate of direct dam- age done to agriculture alone by the 1934 drought placed the figure at five billion dollars; the other hardships it caused are common knowl- edge.40 Weather modification may help alleviate rainfall deficiencies by increasing precipitation (including snowfall in winter) within drainage areas equipped with storage facilities, thus permitting later distribu- tion through irrigation systems.41 Increase of snow or water available for storage would also make possible fuller use of hydroelectric power plants; and diversion of precipitation to higher levels, where a downhill series of such plants exist, would allow multiplied use of its potential energy.42 The mountainous terrain features of such regions furnish an upslope lifting mechanism for cloud formation and continuous moisture supply, and also sites for the less expensive ground generator techni- 39. In the following states, proportions of irrigated farmland, by value, are: Nevada, 95 percent; Utah, 85 percent; Arizona, 75 percent; California, 70 percent; Colorado and Idaho, 65 percent.

As a result, interested persons in Washington and Oregon have shown a desire for continued experiments in these areas.43 Prevention of freezing rain, sleet and glaze Statistics on economic losses caused by these conditions do not seem to have been segregated, but their effects in hampering work, breaking wiring and increasing accident hazard in air, land and sea transporta- tion and in urban and industrial areas, harbors and railroad yards are very sizeable. In farm areas, in addition to the temperature effects themselves, trees and shrubs are broken and overwintering crops are smothered and otherwise damaged by icing conditions.44 Aircraft using nucleation techniques should be able to eliminate icing conditions in clouds at rates covering roughly 1000 square miles per hour, and nucleation of huge masses of air by silver iodide generators on the ground "would prevent all ice storms, all storms of freezing rain, and icing conditions in clouds" in a given area.4Y Icing conditions in fogs, which sometimes cause rime (ice-needle) formation on surface objects, could be similarly treated.46 Cloud andfog dispersal By reducing visibility, clouds increase accident hazards in air trans- portation, and fog likewise endangers and hampers land and sea trans- port. Supercooled clouds and fogs might be dispersed by nucleation techniques already described as well as by ground generator techni- ques. The utility of such cloud and fog dispersal may be demonstrated quite easily. The group of states lying north of the line Fargo-Nashville- Cape Cod receive only 50 per cent or less of their possible winter sunshine; parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine receive only 30 per cent or less. This is largely due to their annual average of 120 to 180 cloudy days, plus an almost equal number of partly cloudy days.47 Dispersal of clouds on a systematic basis in portions of this area "would change 43.

Increase in light received would decrease electric power load for daylight illumina- tion purposes.49 And decrease of cloud cover at other points might increase growing seasons; at particular periods, it might even aid in control of plant diseases, insects and parasites. Forestfires Such fires cost $26,000,000 or more each year and affect 17,000,000 acres of land. The Maine forest fires of October, 1947 did $8,000,000 of damage at Bar Harbor and Kennebunkport alone, not including in- estimable damage to forest lands, watersheds, wild life and timber lands.50 Artificial precipitation techniques, in addition to their possi- bilities with regard to lightning, might produce rainfall to assist in bringing such fires under control.51 At the request of state authorities, Project Cirrus made one such experiment during the Maine fires; 52 there were other official and unofficial attempts in 1947 and 1948 in which varying degrees of success were claimed.53 Flood control In the years 1923-44, flood-caused property losses in the United States averaged more than $100,000,000 annually. No attempts at application of weather modification techniques to flood control prob- lems have been reported, but the possibilities of moderating thunder- storms, or of diverting storms which threaten river basins already approaching flood stage make it clear that flood control should be included as a field of possible application.54 48.

According to General Kenny, Commander of the Strategic Air Force, "the nation which first learns to plot the paths of air masses accurately and learns to control the time and place of precipitation will dominate the globe." 56 Concern with theoretical advances and possible applications should not be permitted to overshadow the ultimate objective of weather con- trol, which is to render calculable the effects of any hypothetical human intervention-to introduce control as distinguished from haphazard interference. Considerable attention should therefore be focussed upon where and when the weather-control trigger ought to be pulled in order to produce the desired results.57 Thus far, colloido-meteorological research has had greater success in supplying the trigger than in chart- ing the results. It is precisely because of this inadequacy of informa- tion in regard to the growing storehouse of modification techniques 58 is much higher.

Such an instrument is being constructed by the Institute for Advanced Studies, R.C.A. Laboratories, and the Army and Navy.

THE RISE OF DISPUTES The legal whirlwind followed fast upon the spate of weather modifi- cation attempts by amateurs as well as scientists. In many instances, these were carried on without recognition of the present impossibility of confining the effects to property owned by persons who were agreed on the desired conditions. Disputes were inevitable, and the size of the personal and economic values involved made it likewise inevitable that these disputes would become "legal" through appeals to the organized community for their settlement. Several have resulted in public threats of litigation in the fields of tort and property law and in one or two instances, actions have been filed.59 Although each of this growing group of controversies has its own facets,60 examination of a few of them will present enough generalized aspects to furnish a foundation for analysis. On October 13, 1947, Project Cirrus conducted a nucleation experi- ment on a hurricane which was then located about 300 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras. By the night of the 14th, the hurricane, which had been moving off-shore, had reversed the direction of its movement. It entered the coast a short distance south of Savannah on the 15th, doing estimated damage of $2,000,000 in the Savannah region and unestimated damage in South Carolina. Disputes soon arose about the relation between the nucleation and the hurricane damage but shortly thereafter, details of information on the matter were classified Pastukh, Kvoprosu ob energetischeskikh vosmozhnostiakh razrusheniia voln kholda (On the question of the possibility of the destruction of cold waves by means of [atomic] energy), Meteorologia i Gidrologia, Informatsionnyi Sbornik [hereafter Met. i Gidr.] No. 2, p. 16 (1946), as abstracted in 28 BULL.

Attempts have been made to explain the event, but a final answer must await release of the re- mainder of the observational data and photographs.61 The lesson to be learned, however, is quite plain: the artificial deflection of a hurri- cane might well result in a considerable number of claims for personal injury and property damage. The second type of problem may be quickly indicated. There is currently pending in the office of the State Engineer of Nevada an application by a ranch owner, based upon the state water rights stat- ute,62 to appropriate water at the rate of 1000 cubic feet per second from all clouds which may pass over the ranch. In the same area, attempts to produce snow in Nevada for ski meets have resulted in charges of illegal water diversion and threats of litigation from Utah. Both attempts and threats began as publicity stunts, but tended to take on a more serious aspect because of the severe droughts in the region.63 In general, two classes of disputes are likely to arise out of attempts at weather modification: claims for personal injury and property damage alleged to have been caused by the modification; and claims of property rights in the weather, or in some particular elements of weather phenomena. Apprehension of such claims has existed almost froni the beginning of experimentation, and has been growing since. Before entering into the Project Cirrus contract, General Electric Company attempted unsuccessfully to have an indemnity clause in- serted. In their very first report, the company's researchers had coun- selled that experiments which were likely to have widespread effects "should be made in relatively unpopulated regions such as Alaska or 61.

In the article cited above, Dr. Langmuir quotes (at 184-5) an eye witness account prepared by Commander Rex, Chairman of the Operations Group of Project Cirrus. This very short report states that seeding at the most desirable points was prevented by failure of the aircraft's homing aids (radio compass and visual flares), but that an area of about 300 square miles was modified. Dr. Langmuir con- cludes: "They felt however that if they could have been on the other side of the squall line, which I already mentioned, some really important things might have happened. What did happen, nobody knows." 62. NEv.COMP.LAWS (Hillyer 1929) § 7890: "The water of all sources of water supply within the boundaries of the state, whether above or beneath the surface of the ground, belongs to the public." §§ 7944 et seq. provide the procedure for appropriation by individuals. 63. See New York Times, Jan. 18, 1948, sec. 4, p. 8E, col. 2. The qualification is indi- cated in a communication to the writer from Hon.

Science is only beginning to scratch the surface of this question, and experiments in it should be carefully controlled." 66 After the hurricane experiment described above, it was reported that General Electric had stopped all outdoor experimenting. Its Director of Research stated that "until the legal problems are clarified, there will be great difficulty in carrying out large-scale experimenta- tion." 67 And press dispatches on August 12, 1948 stated: "Earl Droess- ler, member of the Cirrus steering committee, says the scientists will leave hurricanes strictly alone this summer." 68 LEGAL ANALOGIES "This odd legal vacuum, caused by science," 69 will scarcely con- tinue. Law, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Courts, with or without legislative and administrative assistance, will be called upon to chart the fields of alleged responsibility and ownership.70 In part, the para- meters they draw will be the result of their matching these problems with others already resolved; therefore, an indication of concepts which lie at hand is in order. Liability might be imposed upon those engaging in weather-control 71 activity by application of any of several familiar doctrines of tort or criminal law, as well as under statutes already widely in force. Consider the hypothetical case of a private individual, A, who, by dispensing dry ice from an aircraft without notice or useful purpose, 64.

The primary elements of atmospheric condition here relevant are (a) tempera- ture, (b) winds and air pressure, (c) humidity, and (d) hydrometeors, including all forms of precipitation and such phenomena as lightning. All that we call weather can be expressed by some combination of these elements. 227</page><page sequence="16">THE YALE LAW JOURNAL causes a developing storm system moving at twenty miles per hour to precipitate snow some hours and miles before or after it would other- wise have done-thereby affecting an urban and industrial area of twenty square miles.72 While it is snowing, a number of motor acci- dents occur, substantially contributed to by the reduced visibility and attended by personal injury and property damage; the snow cover impedes traffic and hinders outdoor work, resulting in lost production; and several persons are injured in falls on the insecure footing of the sidewalks. Criminal prosecution and similar statutory penalties In such a case, A might be prosecuted (or enjoined) for creating a public nuisance by obstructing the highways, or for assimilable stat- utory offenses.73 In addition, the aircraft might be seized and im- pounded, a civil penalty recovered, and the pilot's certificate suspended or revoked for violating the Civil Air Regulations which specify that "no person piloting an aircraft shall permit anything to be dropped from an aircraft in flight which might create any hazard to persons or property." 74 Similar statutes or regulations exist in a number of states and some have provided that violation thereof is a misdemeanor.75 Tort liability Theories which might be urged to prove civil liability (including liability to be enjoined) would include absolute liability for trespassory invasion of real estate (including purpresture),76 permitting recovery of at least nominal damages (under many decisions) by all owners of 72. This is well within the results obtained in the Cloud Physics Project tests, Time, Dec. 6, 1948, p. 50. Use of atomic energy or other proposed methods would produce sim- ilar types of modifications and all would probably involve dispensing materials from air- craft. 73. See, e.g., N.Y.

In view of the distances at which effects may occur, the puta- tive plaintiff is extremely unlikely ever to discover even the fact of the weather-modification activity. Nor is this his only hurdle. The dean of British meteorologists has said that "Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based upon some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale." 82 For some time, one of the most difficult questions which will be before courts in these cases, if indeed it succeeds in reaching them, is the question of "causation in fact." Proof of what happened during a weather modification attempt will represent an effort to reconstruct the flow of events in an air colunln whose volume may range up to thousands of cubic miles, inclined at varying angles from the earth's surface and moving at speeds ranging up to forty or more miles per hour. M\ajor transformations will always be in process-being accomplished by invisible air movements and by such hard-to-measure factors as pressure, temperature, humidity and the actions of submicroscopic colloidal particles. The most intensive and extensive instrumentation so far used has left the precise effects of nucleation techniques in specific instances a matter of some doubt, at least so far as declassified and published data and opinions are con- cerned.83 In the niany amateur efforts, all that can be presented are scanty pictures of temporal succession. Such inadequate descriptions might have to multiply for years before rudimentary, empirico-intui- tive assertions of necessary connections could be made on a statistical basis. Judges' rules of thunmb for spanning such gaps in evidence of causa- tion have been developing for centuries, using amorphous statistics winnowed from a vast vague harvest called "human experience." From time to time, aid has been drawn from a body of theoretical explanations which frequently require far more data than can be un- 82. Sir Napier Shaw, in 1 MANUAL OF METEOROLOGY 23 (1933). 83. Some notion of what is needed can be had from FIRST CIRRUS REPORT, Part IV: Instrumentation Developed for the Cloud Study Project, listing (in addition to standard aircraft instruments, aerograph, cameras, dry ice dispenser and silver iodide generator) the icing rate exposure rod, clinometer attachment for camera, wire recorder, cloud (liquid water content) meter, exposure gun and air decelerator, and altimeter and elevator position recorder; and Part VIII, Proposed Flight Plans, emphasizing the need for simultaneous use of three aircraft (radar equipped), a complete photographic record (color, infra-red, stereoscopic and polarized filter) at the rate of one picture per minute, and other records synchronized to the second with such flight data as heading, altitude, airspeed and temperature. The Weather Bureau has found a very dense network of ground observation stations (observers not over a mile or two apart) and precipitation recorders, plus radar scope photographs, necessary to scientific precision in its weather modification experiments.

In the present situation, there is no experience; and the most sanguine theoreticians do not claim that scientific explanations can be adequate where almost none of the in- formation needed is likely to be gathered unless some prior legal re- quirement to that effect is imposed.84 In the past, courts confronted with such mysteries have eventually forced a trial balance by deciding that res ipsa loquzitur. Useful as this concept may be in other contexts, the length of time needed for it to approach resolution of the present problem can be gleaned from its history in the field of air transport, which is apposite because it in- volves the interaction of humanly controlled agencies and atmospheric conditions. In the last half century, private, commercial and military aviation has assumed gigantic proportions; but courts are still not able to locate a sufficient fund of "common" experience to make possi- ble inferences or estimates of probabilities as to weather effects on the behaviour of aircraft and their operators.85 The reason for this inability seems obvious: it lies in the nature of the activity and in its conditions; the difficulties will be even greater in the case of weather modification operations.86 Advances in dynamic and descriptive meteorology of the sort already referred to will in time resolve doubts, as they must if control is to be completely rational; but only in the presence of exhaustive instrumentation, observation and record-keeping can "what happened" be reconstructed. The pressing 84. Such requirements have been found necessary in state regulation of aerial crop- dusting operations. See, e.g., Idaho Session Laws 1947, c. 264, empowering the state Commissioner of Agriculture to control such activity; regulations require, inter alia, a license, that the operator keep informed as to proper climatic conditions and refrain from spraying when wind velocity exceeds ten miles per hour, use of insecticides of certain weights, timing of operations so as not to endanger pollinating insects, bees or livestock, and the keeping of complete records. Conn. Supp. to Gen. Statutes, § 842i, (1947), makes it a crime to engage in crop dusting without permit and waiver of state aeronautics regu- lations. Cf. Minn. Laws 1947, c. 560 (Commissioner of Agriculture to regulate and issue permits for insect control operations by aircraft); Wis. Laws 1947, S.B. 458 (regulation of crop dusting over forest and non-crop areas). 85. The latest of the considerable literature on this subject seems to be O'Connor, Res Ipsa in the Air, 22 IND.L.J. 221 (1947).

Another, with reference to the doctrine of res ipsa, is that it may not be invoked to prove that an instrumentality caused any particular result-the crucial question at the moment. Holloway v. Skelly Oil Co., 68 F.Supp. 129 (E.D.Mo. 1946). Further, if an analogy to water flowage torts were to be chosen, plaintiff would be required to show how much of his damages are at- tributable to defendant's conduct and how much to natural causes for which defendant is not responsible-in a context where the two are likely to be inextricably blended.

In this connection, a further dificulty may be noted. The consensus of those who have examined the possibilities of loss and liability is that they may easily amount to millions of dollars for a single mis- carriage of the operations; a fortiori where elaborate precautions are not taken. In a situation where the only capital equipment required to cause such damage is an airplane, a quantity of granulated dry ice or the equipment for some other technique and a desire to do something about the weather, it seems inevitable that a judgment representing even the strictest of civil liability will be too often merely an empty declaration which effects no actual redistribution of incidence. Conduct of the activity by government, its contractors or permittees Some of the rules adduced will ultimately depend not only upon the manner and location of the activity, but upon who conducts it and with what purposes. Imposition of liability is progressively less stringent, even to the point of allowing immunity, as the activity is found to be socially valuable, or "public" in the sense of a formally authorized function of government; and the same would be true when the activity is carried on by the permittees or contractors, or employees and officials of government. Thus, the traditional legal doctrines of purpresture and public nuisance relax where the temporary obstruction of the public way is for a public purpose; 87 inapplicability or waiver of aer- onautics regulations would obviate the penalties there prescribed; 88 the rule of ultrahazardous activity is said not to apply where govern- mental sanction shows the conduct to be reasonable despite imminent risks; 89 the utility and social value of the activity would dispel most of the charges of private nuisance; 0 and the argument for treating technical trespasses as accidental intrusions, not entailing liability,9l gains force in such public activities. But the extent of this insulation varies, and is by no means certain even as to given acts or actors. In addition, under the recent Federal Tort Claims Act,92 the defendant who seeks to avoid liability by way of 87. Brey v. Rosenfeld, 48 A.2d 177 (R.I. 1946); Rief v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel.

However, the extent to which this act can be urged as declaring a new view of the social value of government-sponsored conduct is at present unknown; courts have not yet had time to plot vectors for these seemingly convergent policy notions.93 Security restrictions If, as is possible, weather modification activity is conducted only by the Federal Government and its contractors, adequate instru- mentation, observation and record-keeping is likely to be had. But persons who suffer harm would probably encounter another type of difficulty-that of discovering that a basis for a claim existed, or what that basis was.94 The Army Regulations (and similar Navy Regula- tions) impose security restrictions on classified data, the applicable provision specifying that information, ". .. the unauthorized disclosure of which, while not endangering the national security, would be prejudicial to the interests or pres- tige of the nation, or any governmental activity, an individual, or would cause administrative embarrassment or difficulty, or be of advantage to a foreign nation shall be classified confidential."95 A threatened flood of lawsuits or claims for administrative attention could conceivably be fitted within this framework and be considered prejudicial to the nation or a governmental activity.96 Possible liability 93. The short statute of limitations contained in the Federal Tort Claims Act will, of course, leave situations in which the contractor might remain liable while action against the Government has been barred. 94. The following is quoted from 25 CHEM. AND ENG.N. 3050 (1947), published on October 13, 1947: "G.E. attorneys report that they have already been threatened with damage suits where citizens suspect they had a hand in adverse weather. The Army's solution of the problem would be to classify all weather experiment information as 'con- fidential' or 'secret.'" 95. The Army's rules are AR 380-5 (1946); the Navy's, NR 76 (repr. 1941) and Change 25 (1944).

The 1946 amendment to the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 60 STAT. 944, 49 U.S.C. 603 (1946), authorizes the Chief of the Weather Bureau to provide for pub- lication of the results of research under the Section "unless such publication would be contrary to the public interest." 96.

If any recovery is to be generally allowed for harm caused by weather modification experi- ments by government or its contractors, and in some or most instances, purely military considerations dictate nondisclosure, a method of ad- ministering the risk without public litigation is needed.97 Claims of property in weather phenomena That the effects of weather modification may give rise to conflicting property claims has already been indicated in a prior section. Invoking "water rights" doctrines, the disputants in those situations asserted, in one instance, a right to "appropriate" cloud moisture, and in another, a right to prevent its "illegal diversion." In a survey like the present one, there is space for only the briefest sketch of applicable legal analogies-a crude precis which must cover the country, for although these claims were made in or among "appropriation" states, similar contentions could be made anywhere.98 WATER RIGHTS. Treating the atmosphere as an available source of water, the claimant has a choice among doctrines. Taking a rather weak analogy to streams, he may, in some eastern states, assert the "natural flow," or so-called English rule: that he shall receive the end- less stream of air in its natural state, and, seemingly, thereby put an end to technological progress in this direction.

A recent case on the question of the court's power to pass on the claim to secrecy in a lawsuit is Zimmerman v. Poindexter, 74 F. Supp. 933 (D.Haw. 1947). One question not yet treated by the writers is whether the one-year statute of limitations of the Tort Claims Act runs if a prospective claimant is unable to learn about the facts because of security restrictions. Such information is difficult to come by even absent restrictions, as the law has recognized. Art. 17 of the Rome Convention of 1933, covering ground damage by aircraft in international transpor- tation, proposed deferring the running of limitation for up to three years, where claim- ant could show his inability to learn the facts or the identity of the person liable.

In the western states (including the two involved in the examples given), he may assert that by compliance with statutory formalities, he obtains a "right" to the use of the at- mosphere superior to that of later applicants and appropriators; that right, once ripened, is conclusive against all but the police power and eminent domain. But the rules which are most likely to be urged as analogous are those relating to so-called diffuse surface and percolating subsurface waters, in which early failure to recognize the interdependence of water sources has resulted in giving the landowner rights of conflict- breeding breadth. He may capture such waters in well or ditch; this makes him an "artificial producer" of water, and it becomes his "prop- erty," with all the incidents thereof, so long as he can hold it. The argument will run that he may do the same with moisture passing through his airspace. When the question is one of diverting undesirable weather onto someone else, there is still another set of rules to invoke-those of water disposal. The diverter may describe the activity as part of a fight against the "common enemy"-water; the unwilling recipient will reply that nature must be allowed to take its own course under the civil law rule, drawing in a plethora of conceptions of "servitudes" with Latin names; 99 and both sides may argue that the third available view, that of reasonable use, coincides with their own contentions. At present, the jurisdictions are divided among all three views, a com- partmentalization which the effects of weather modification are certain to span. The foregoing is greatly oversimplified; almost every state has super- imposed upon the basic rules decisional or statutory modification forced by pressures of conflict and confusion, and more or less in accord with advances in knowledge. Gradually, these have tended to take the form of continuing administration of water supply in the public in- terest.100 In the interstate field, which is being increasingly recognized, 99. Martin v. Simpson, 6 Allen (Mass.) 102 (1863) discusses the stillicidium, or right to have water discharge in drops, and flumen, or right to have it flow. The servitude to have air flow unimpeded for windmills seems to be referred to in State ex rel. Crowley v. Dist. Court, 108 Mont. 89, 101, 88 P.2d 23, 28 (1939).

Maugre all this willing- ness to cut and try, enough substantive rules of property in water re- main to furnish ammunition even for arguments about the weather. Any or all of the doctrines could be urged as analogous, especially that of the "artificial producer." It would seem more desirable, however, to reject substantive prop- erty analogies. The history of water law, like that of airspace owner- ship, oil, wild life, and even of radio's ether, is a story of a first cyclopean focus on things,-and a final realization of the inadequacy of reified concepts of property, or of rules of capture, as guides for umpiring dis- putes between men about complex practices.102 Claims of "property" are mere shorthand for arguments that the claimant is to be protected or left undisturbed in a very wide range (the widest known to the law) of practices related to a physical phenomenon. In new and uncertain fields, what is needed is a modus operandi permitting careful break- down of problems, not a shorthand which obscures them by assuming the existence of knowledge, of precision and of the suitability of ready- to-wear principles fabricated in other contexts. The problem is pri- marily one of the development of certain techniques by which effects, both beneficial and harmful, may be produced-effects which will transcend the importance and boundaries of the varying sets of water doctrines. Weather modification techniques operate under conditions which are even more wandering and widespread. They are identifiable largely in terms of scientific postulations-to assert property in hy- drometeors or other atmospheric elements is almost on a par with claiming the planets and galaxies which, as the earth turns, pass into the landowner's hypothetically infinite but recently much riddled funnel of dominion.103 If development can be continued and more data 101.

In the words of the Chief of the Weather Bureau, "the legal slate is still clear." 104 Certainly the law can do better than merely to copy upon it the mis- takes of the past. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS AND PROGRAM OF ACTION Current views on how the problems of law and policy raised by weather control should be answered are scanty and hard to combine. One position is that legislation would be premature and, seemingly, that what should come next is a great deal of litigation-to allow the common law to work out judicial policy.105 Another is that litigation would be premature in that it would tie up experimentation; 106 and the third is, more inclusively, that no further field experimentation is feasible until the legal cloud has been cleared by legislating the matter into the hands of a new organ of administration.107 The result is a three-horse carousel whose rotations must somehow be transformed into forward movement. The preliminary analysis and suggested steps which follow are presented as one means of breaking the current impasse. That experimentation and research in the modification and control of weather will continue until its possibilities are fully explored, and that legal obstructions must somehow be removed, are virtually cer- tain.108 The unsuitability of ocean areas for most experiments, and the delay, expense and other logistic difficulties involved in construct- ing, manning and servicing the necessary elaborate facilities in remote locations mean that the research will be conducted in large part in the United States. But not enough is yet known about the factual possibil- ities of existing and future modification techniques to permit perma- nent selection of agencies and standards for the administration of their use. 104.

Otherwise, considerable damage to persons and property may result-in a way and on a scale which make redress through civil liability formally difficult and practically ineffective unless the actor is eminently solvent; all without producing any ap- preciable benefits in increased scientific knowledge or useful amel- ioration of unfavorable weather. If this is so, what is needed for the interim period, however short, is a moratorium upon such irresponsible activity. IN-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES. One way in which this may be accomplished has already been hinted at above. The Civil Aeronautics Board should be requested to investigate and determine whether the modification practices which involve dropping nucleating materials from aircraft in flight "might create any hazard to persons or property," within the meaning of its Civil Air Regulations. It should have access, for this purpose, to classified as well as unclassified information possessed by other agencies and departments of government, and should weigh the possible values of unplanned experimentation against its dangers. If it finds that a hazard may be so created, it can notify airmen and otherwise announce that the dropping of dry ice, silver iodide, or other nucleating material from civil aircraft in flight is a violation of safety requirements and will be penalized in the ways prescribed by law.109 If necessary, this step could be buttressed by amending the regulation concerning carriage of articles so as to define as "not acceptable" granulated dry ice, silver iodide, and nucleator-dispensing equip- ment.110 GROUND GENERATION TECHNIQUES. To effect the moratorium upon this type of weather modification activity (of which there appear to have been few instances so far) would require slightly different au- thority, but this seems also to be available. One of the hazards which irresponsible operation of ground generators may well create is danger to interstate and foreign air commerce. Under existing authority to safeguard this commerce, the Civil Aeronautics Administration has required publication of notice of the erection of ground structures 109. Considerations already mentioned might make enforcement difficult. As a solu- tion to this broader problem, delegation to state courts and aviation agencies of concur- rent jurisdiction to enforce the regulations has been recommended in the Report of the Temporary Congressional Aviation Policy Board (1948). 110. 14 CODE FED.

GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. Some laws considered applicable to weather modification are extant, and legislative proposals directed more specifically thereto have begun to appear. The experiments already conducted by the Weather Bureau have been undertaken under the 1946 amendment to the Civil Aeronautics Act "1 which directs the Chief of the Weather Bureau to make studies of atmospheric phenomena for forecasting purposes and to promote and develop meteorological science. The Civil Aeronautics Act amendment was passed before the present discoveries were made, and a question has lately been raised as to whether it properly authorizes weather control experimentation.1l6 To 111. 14 CODE FED.

The defect of such a proposal is readily apparent. Since the physical problem extends beyond control of rainfall, a statute like H.R. 4582 must be broadened to include modification or control of all weather elements. 120 Other attempts at legislative resolution of the problem have been made at the lower levels of government. State Senator Pruett of Oklahoma has drafted for introduction in that state's legislature a measure authorizing the State Board of Agriculture to induce rain artificially by the in-flight use of dry ice, either in cooperation with the Federal Government or with private contractors.121 The State Water Survey Division of Illinois, apparently under existing statutory au- thority, has already engaged in some observational research pertaining to weather control and proposes to continue and expand such activity in cooperation with the Federal Government.122 At the local level, the County Counsel of Los Angeles County has recently rendered an opinion that artificial production of rainfall is an authorized public function.123 117.

One of its dozen exceptions to the general waiver of sovereign immunity withholds jurisdiction to consider or allow: "Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the dis- cretion involved be abused." 124 Under the literal wording of the first part of the quoted section, the incorporation into H.R. 4582 of a clear and inclusive authority to conduct research into modification and control of meteorological phenomena (perhaps even "including but not limited to" the specific applications described in preceding portions of this article) would bring the activity, so far as Government is concerned, within the ex- ception. Thus, no liability would fall upon it without negligence. And since discretion must exist in the Weather Bureau to choose the nature, location and time of experiments, having regard to the preexisting and probable atmospheric conditions and the possibilities of damage or hardship, the activity might well fall also within the discretionary por- tion of the exception. Such an approach is not necessarily reprehensible or even more than is comprehended by already-existing proposals.125 The fact must be faced that these experiments cannot be carried on in our heavily settled country of intertwined ownerships and conflicting interests and at the same time avoid every risk, however small, and however much over- balanced by the benefits which the work is designed to produce. Here is a situation in which "causative factors are . . . difficult to eval- uate," and "repercussions" may be "so extensive, their economic im- pact so considerable, that governmental assumption of liability might entail tremendous expense and large administrative difficulties." The risks are not now calculable and operations do not "predictably in- volve individually-focussed losses." It has been urged that in such cases: 124. 60 STAT. 842, 28 U.S.C. § 921 (1946). 125. For example, Senator Pruett's proposed Oklahoma statute declares that artificial rain can only partly be considered man-made, and provides regarding legal liability: ". .. any rain that may be superinduced by the use of dry ice . . . is hereby declared to be the Act of God, and no person can predicate any claim for damages on a rain so produced, and the Board of Agriculture and those acting under and by their authority shall be free from all injunction remedies in the execution of the provisions of this Act." 241</page><page sequence="30">THE YALE LAW JOURNAL ". .. as in the case of policy choices which affect the national economy, there are strong arguments against the Government's becoming the guarantor of the financial wellbeing of every citizen who is touched by a decision. Living together in civilized com- munities is a protection for man; but it also exposes him to occa- sional perils." 126 If fuller statutory authority for weather control experiments would bring their conduct within the exceptions to governmental liability, any Congressional attempt to remove the exception and thereby as- sume the burden of liability should be the product of insight and forthrightness. It would be unfortunate indeed if the problem were evaded by adopting the unsatisfactory substitute of leaving officials with too-scanty authority for what they are intended to do-thus, perhaps, even subjecting them to personal liability. AUTHORITY TO INDEMNIFY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS. The prospect of liability in damages to hordes of claimants may well prove an effec- tive deterrent to continued research by private contractors unless some provision for indemnification is made. Losses resulting from opera- tions carried on by Government contractors should be either shared by Government and contractor (to the extent that the contractor may have insurance) or borne by the nation for whose benefit the work is undertaken. It has already been officially stated that private con- tractors for weather modification and other scientific researches cannot otherwise be obtained.127 To resolve this problem, Representative Andrews introduced into the 80th Congress H.R. 4035, which pro- vides that: "With the approval of the Secretary concerned, any contract for [scientific] research or development, or both, may provide that the Government will indemnify the contractor against either or both of the following, to the extent that they arise out of the performance of said contract, and are not compensated by insurance or other- wise: (1) Liability on account of claims (including reasonable ex- penses of litigation or settlement of such claims), by third persons, including employees of the contractor, for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; Provided, that any contract so pro- viding shall also contain appropriate provisions for notice to the Government of suits or actions filed, or claims made, against the contractor, with respect to any alleged liability for such death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property, and for control of or assistance in the defense of any such suit, action, or claim, by the Government, at its election; . . . Provided further, That no pay- ment shall be made by the Government under authority of this 126. Gellhorn and Schenck, Tort Actions Against the Federal Government, 47 COL. L.

" There are objections in some quarters to the precise form of H.R. 4035, but from what has been said, it is clear that this or substantially sim- ilar legislation should be enacted.128 WAIVER OF IMMUNITY. The dichotomy in policy presented between H.R. 4035 and the previously-discussed H.R. 4582, as they interact in the present situation, is clearly apparent. Together, they propose that the Government is to be authorized to conduct weather control experiments, and be immune from paying losses unless negligent. But if the same experiments are non-negligently conducted through con- tractors, and liability is nevertheless imposed on them, the Govern- ment is to pay the losses, and thus indirectly adopt a policy of insuring reimbursement to the persons harmed-although its real purpose is only the protection of its contractor. This means that recovery for losses caused by the same kind of activity for the same purpose may depend on no more than the ability of the claimant to implicate a contractor in the activity. Such a distinction is unjust. The decision ought to be made squarely: either the immunity should be extended to contractors or the immunity should be waived in the case of Govern- ment as well as contractor. The most desirable course would seem to be enactment of the legisla- tion embodied in H.R. 4035 without change in substance; at the same time, a waiver of immunity should be inserted into H.R. 4582 or what- ever legislation embodies the authority for weather control experi- mentation. If and when weather control, as distinct from mere hopeful and exploratory interference, is established sufficiently (albeit imper- fectly) to become a normal function of government, it will be time enough to apply the theory that the advantages of civilization are the compensation for its much smaller harms and to recognize that the burden of administering examination of millions of separate claims cannot be undertaken. What we have at present is an experiment with a possible new service of government, untried and potentially dangerous. If, as many think, weather modification techniques cannot really change weather, nothing will have been lost by the declaration that Government stood ready to distribute losses ratably. If, however, even though most carefully conducted, they should cause a disaster, the entire loss should not be borne by those whose only fault was to be unfortunate enough to live and have property in the area affected by the experiment-and who have each an interest in weather benefits 128. One such objection is said to be the hardship on contractor of awaiting reimburse- ment.

Of course, the claimant's problems of proof would still be large, and at the least, the records of operations would have to be made available to him. During the suggested moratorium period, the Government would be party to or have election to defend all claims and could itself ensure full presentation of the considerations which would enable just resolu- tion of those doubtful cases which cannot ever be entirely avoided. If courts then allow liabilities which Congress considers unwisely as- sumed, the waiver of immunity could be revised. Additional circum- stances may be found to alter the case; but the course which seems fairest for the present is that of extending the range of Federal Govern- ment tort liability by waiving immunity which exists merely because the activity is in execution of a statute. Thefuture It must be reiterated that the inquiries and measures just suggested are purely stop-gap in nature; they must be left behind as speedily as scientific advance permits and requires. If research and experimenta- tion succeed, implementation of the view that weather control is within the public sphere will present a labor of which the observations here made are no more than an earnest. To this national and interna- tional task, the treaty and commerce powers are technically adequate, but detailed adaptation will require investigations and improvisations more complex than seem presently recognized.131 129. See Bohlen, Aviation Under the Common Law, 48 HARV. L. REV. 216, 219 (1934), to the effect that subsidization of experimentation by relieving it from liability is incor- rect; it is fairer to place the cost upon the public treasury. 130. See AR 25-25, par. 9 (1946), covering small claims arising out of noncombat ac- tivities having "little parallel in civilian pursuits" and permitting allowance without a showing of negligence where because of the peculiar nature of the activity or of the re- sulting damage, "the burden of the loss should be borne rather by the Government than by the particular individual on whom the loss initially fell." An activity historically so con- sidered was the operation of aircraft; cf. AR 25-70 (1947).
