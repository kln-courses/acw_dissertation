<plain_text><page sequence="1">Andamans. Lang. 30 Puluga. By A. Lang. Though I am greatly guilty of a '' theory of a primitive All-Father," which to Mr. A. R. Brown seems "nothing but a system of elaborate misinter- pretation'' (Folk-Lore, XX, 3, p. 258), yet his article, and his controversy with Pere Schmidt, are full of interest to me, and I think I discern the point where Mr. Brown and I diverge. It is a point of great importance. He writes (MAN, 1910, 17, p. 34): "I carefully abstained from comparing the beliefs of the Andamanese with "those of any other peoples, whether related or unrelated, because I am convinced "that such comparisons are more dangerous than they are helpful." Thus it appears that there is to be no study of comparative mythology. But Mr. Brown may mean that an observer on the spot should merely give his facts; what I doubt is, whether or not he allows the stay-at-home reader to try to strike light out of comparisons. Assuming that liberty, under all reserves, I will try to show how the case of Puluga strikes an inquirer bred in the old-fashioned comparative method. I should say that I have no preconceived opinions to the effect that the male Puluga of the isles Bale and Bea is part of an older belief, though it is of a far more usual type of belief than that in the female Biliku or Bilika of the more northern group. Mr. Brown's conclusions are that "Puluga is a personification of the N.N.E. "monsoon, and is one of a pair, the other being Daria" (elsewhere Tarai, Teria, * W. Crahmer, Globus, Bd. 94 (1908), p. 301; Bd. 95 (1909), pp. 345, 360; Bd. 97 (1910), p. 78. [51]</page><page sequence="2">No. 30.J MAN. [1910. Deria), " the S. S.W. monsoon " (MAN, p. 33). The words Biliku, Bilika, denote spider, as well as the being Biliku, in the northern isles; in the southern Bilik and Puluga are on]y applied to the mythic being, and, I presume, in thlese isles the common spider is otherwise lnamed (Folk-Lore, p. 259). It seems to me conceivable that the southern islanders have tabued puluga for spider, and reserved it for the mythic beiing. Mr. Brown "could find no sufficient evidence for any of the " explanations that suggested themselves to him" "of the connection of Biliku with the spider" (MAN, p. 35). Why a monsoon should be called a spider is indeed a puzzling question! III my old-fatshioned comparative way I am anxious to know whether any parallel exists in the mythology of other peoples dwelling in the region of monsoons ? We must remember that the N.E. wind is not called Biliku, but is styled Bilikti Boto, Bilik Tau, Puluga Toa, Puluga Ta; while in the four northern isles the S.W. wind is not styled Tarai, but Tarai Boto. I do not observe that Mr. Brown translates Boto, Tau, Toa, and Ta, but we may, under correction, and corroborated by Mr. Man (Journ. Anthr. Inst., XII, 38, for Ta), guess that these words mean wind: wind of Biliku and of Puluga, wind of Tarai. If so, at present the winds are distinguished from the beings who send them. Mr. Brown "has carefully avoided attributing to the Andamanese, even in the " past, any belief for which there is not direct evidence . . ." (MAN, p. 34 (5) ). But he is human, and has reached the conclusion, for which there can be no " direct evidence," that " Puluga is a personification of the N.N.E. monsoon." We cannot travel into the past, and observe the ancestors of the Andamanese while destitute of Puluga, but beginning to personify the S.E. wind under a name meaning spider, certainly a strange name for a wind. This spider (or his brothers or sons) is not the wind, but he, or his kinsfolk, sends the winds. The N.N.E. wind accompanies fine weather, and it is not Tarai, of the rainy wind, but Puluga, who sends all storms. This " particularly puzzles " Mr. Brown (Folk-Lore, p. 267), and I do not wonder at it. But why Spider ? On my obsolete method of comparison, though I cannot explain why a spider, of all things, was chosen as the name of a potent being (not of a wind, Puluga and Biliku do not mean wind), I can at least offer parallels. The spider, as a potent being, is Ananzi, the spider of negro mythology. Stories about him and his feats are called " Nancy stories" in our West Indian colonies. I have no books at hand on Ananzi the spider in African beliefs, but it is plain that a spider may be a leading character in mythology, in places wholly remote from the Andaman Isles. Again, we all know the potent being of Bushman belief, named (in Bleek's theory) after the Mantis insect, Cagn. On Cagn I have read Orpen (Cape Monthly Magazine,, IX, 1877, July) and Bleek, who identifies Cagn with the Mantis insect (Brief Account of Bushman Folk-Lore, London, 1875, cf. Myth, Ritual, and Religion, II, pp. 34, 35, 1901). Fatber Schmidt quotes, as to Cagn, Arbousset and Daumas (1872), A. Merensky (1875), Wangemann (1872), Orpen, and Bleek, but doubts certain points in Bleek's version. He does not like the entomological etymology (Schmidt, Die Stellung der Pygmaen Volker, pp. 236-241). It is superfluous to name other theriomorphic potent primal beings of savage belief usually opposed to each other like Tarai and Biliku. We all know the North American Wolf and Raven, and the South-East Australian Eagle Hawk (Punjel) and Crow, the American Great Hare, and so forth. There is the usual confusion; Puluga, the spider, is anthropomorphic (like Baiame and Daramulun) (Folk-Lore, p. 270). Now, guess for guess, I think, from the parallels adduced, that Biliku (female) and Puluga (male) are creations of imagination in search for a first cause: Biliku "created " earth, sea, and sky in many myths, and they (or he and she) are " definitely [ 52</page><page sequence="3">1910.] MAN. [No. 30. " separated from the ancestors, and are not regarded as one of them" (Folk-Lore, pp. 262, 264-267). Thus, as far as I may conjecture, Biliku-Puluga-spiders-are not the personifications of the N.N.E. monsoon, which is their Boto, Tau, Toa, Ta-their "Wind of God," as in Kingsley's " Ode to the East Wind." The question is of no great moment. Puluga is there now, however he came there, about which neither Mr. Brown or I can do more than guess. The great peculiarity about Andamanese mythology is that, in the dualism so very common in savage and other beliefs, Biliku "has come to occupy so large a place in " Andaman mythology compared with the other "-Tarai. This has caused Mr. Brown to " wonder many times " (Folk-Lore, p. 267). If he did not think that " comparisons 46 are odious" he would wonder less, for in savage mythology the better of the two opposed beings, though often thwarted by his opposite, is much the more prominent and victorious figure. In the isles "there seem to be no legends at all concerning Tarai " (Folk-Lore, p. 267), so that Tarai, if there be no legends at all about him, can scarcely be regarded as a potent being, and as " the counterpart of Biliku " (Folk- Lore, p. 259). Yet, as in the north he is the husband of Biliku, he is so far personified, and it is curious that there are no legends about him; some may, perhaps, be discovered. A person of whom no legends are known, at all events, is no "counterpart" of a person about whom there are so many legends, and who is so puissant as BilikuL- Puluga. As to his or her ethical aspect Mr. Brown found no corroboration of Mr. Man's statements. He therefore "' ventures to think that, perhaps unwittingly, Mr. Man suggested to his informant that PuluLga was angry if one man wronged another, and " the native of course agreed. . . "(p. 271). That is cutting the knot with an axe! Can anyone believe that Mr. Man inquired of only one informant, made suggestions to him, anid accepted his evidence ? Mr. Man, confessedly a careful observer, who lived rather longer (namely, eleven years) in this region than Mr. Brown did, writes thus "1 I have taken special care, not only to obtain my information on each point from those wno are regarded by their " fellow tribesmen as authorities, but who, from having had little or no intercourse with " other races, were in entire ignorance regarding any save their own legends. I have besides, in every case, by subsequent inquiry, endeavoured to test their statements, " with the trustworthiness of which I am thoroughly satisfied " (Journ. Anthr. Inst., XII, p. 157). Mr. Brown can "speak with ungrudging praise" of Mr. Man's book (Folk-Lore, p. 257). I think we may suspend our opinion where the two authorities differ, without deciding that Mr. Man was, on this point, so strangely careless in collecting and testing evidence. I have but one other remark to make. Mr. Brown speaks of a suggestio falsi in Pere Schmidt's use (in English) of the word " torch " where MIr. Brown uses " fire- brand." But as, in German, Pere Schmidt employs the term Feuerbrand where Mr. Brown uses "fire-brand," perhaps we need not blame the learned writer for a suggestio falsi; some accident of translation seems more probable than suggestio falsi; and this view is not the less courteous. I refer to Pere Schmidt's Die Stellung der Pygmaen- Volker, p. 206 (Stuttgart: Strecker und Schbrder, 1910). Both Puluga and mortal men "brandish burning logs," says Mr. Man, against evil spirits (Journ. Anthr. Inst., XII, pp. 97, 152). We are likely to understand the subject better when we have Mr. Brown's book in our hands and can compare it with that of Mr. Man. In the meantime, between monsoons and moons in mythology, and arguments drawn from conchology and conjectural etymology, a wise passiveness seems an appropriate mental attitude. A. LANG.
