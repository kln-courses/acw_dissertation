<plain_text><page sequence="1">" Perfectly Whole ": Skin and Text in John Gabriel Stedman's Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam Emily Senior John Gabriel Stedman's Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1790) is an account of colonial military life haunted by the specter of disease. Mortality ran at over eighty per cent among the troops forming the 1772 European expedition to eliminate the Maroon slaves who threatened to undermine imperial order in the Dutch colony of Suriname. The high death toll was caused not by the frequent unsuccessful military operations against revolutionary slaves, but by rampant disease, and the Narrative does not falter in its catalog of the illnesses suffered by Stedman and his fellow soldiers. In the midst of illness and at a point where he despairs for his life, Stedman anticipates his own epitaph: Under this Stone, Lays the Skin and the Bone, While the Flesh was Long gone of poor Stedman Who Still took up his Pen, And Exousted his Brain, In the Hopes these Last Lines Might be red Man. . . J This premature eulogy encompasses Stedman's two primary concerns: the integrity of the body in a colony teeming with disease; and the ambition that his Narrative might stand as an exhaustive portrait of life in Suriname. With sickness all around him, Stedman is acutely aware of the fragility of his own body. Improbably, how- ever, the fantasy of his own burial envisages his skin remaining intact.

Images of dissected, flayed, peeling, and whipped skins appear constantly as the fear of disease inflects his writing with a mortuary imagination focusing on gruesome imagery of the living body in a process of dis- integration. Stedman's obituary image of his whole, buried skin encapsulates the idea of the tropical colony as a living death. The Narrative ', as Mary Louise Pratt describes it, is "a vivid discursive compendium," combining military history with anthropology, ethnography, natural history, and sentimental romance.2 As well as an active defense of slavery and planta- tion owners, it presents one of the most compelling indictments of slave-dependent societies ever published. The Narrative is renowned for its horrific descriptions of slave abuse and the accompanying illustrative plates, sixteen of which were engraved on commission by William Blake for its initial publication in 1796. Scholarly at- tention has focused on several key themes, and has revolved particularly around Stedman's influence on Blake's own work. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker have argued that Blake's poetry was "deeply colored by Stedman's text, pictures, and friendship."3 A central issue has been what Marcus Wood calls the "sentimen- talist agendas" of Stedman's alarming descriptions of ritualized violence against slaves and Blake's engravings of these scenes.4 While Wood and Mario Klarer have framed the imagery in the Narrative in terms of its sexualization of suffering black bodies, Anne Mellor has emphasized the "visual evasion of textual violence" in both Blake's plates and Stedman's original watercolors.5 Another important topic, which has been addressed by Mary Louise Pratt, Jenny Sharpe, Werner Sollors, and Helen Thomas, is the interracial relationship between Stedman and his "Suriname wife" Joanna, a fifteen-year-old mulatto domestic slave.6 Absent from many of these accounts, however, is a sense of the overwhelming misery of sickness and death permeating Stedman's daily existence, which has been understood simply as the inevitable backdrop to either the colonial romance or the association with Blake. As Alan Bewell has noted, the Narrative documents the mounting public anxiety, during the antislavery debates of the 1790s, about the epidemiological cost of empire.7 Stedman claims that of 1,200 Dutch soldiers sent to Suriname during the 1770s, less than a hundred returned home alive (N, 607). In their 1988 edition of the Narrative, Richard Price and Sally Price record a different figure, but suggest a similarly dismal mortality rate: of the 1,650 soldiers sent to Suriname, only a couple of hundred survived (N, xxvi). Within the context of such massive fatalities from disease, Stedman fo- cuses his attention on skin as the site of physical corruption and decay. The late eighteenth-century European fascination with skin as a marker of health and hu- man difference was nowhere more evident than in the colonies, where it became the focus for medical and racial models of the body. The assault on colonial bodies wrought by climate, combat, disease, and punishment is revealed in the Narrative through a dissective lens concerned with the integrity and inferiority of bodies and their parts. The unity of the human body is undermined as the corruption, loss, and removal of skin come to symbolize the decaying effect of the colony on all bodies. This sense of physical corrosion is mirrored by the disunity of the Narrative as text, as the endless stream of dead and dying bodies also functions to unsettle the sense of an overarching plot scheme and the problem of bodily integrity leaks into</page><page sequence="3">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 41 one of narrative integrity. Of course, skin was also particularly significant as the site of the abuse of slaves: "whipping or flaying," as Deirdre Coleman succinctly puts it, "was the modus operandi of plantation slavery."8 Stedman bears witness to frequent acts of branding, flagellation, and mutilation inflicted upon slaves, relat- ing them in macabre detail. Using anatomical, ethnographic, medical, and natural historical discourses, he imagines what happens to the skin when it is injured by disease or violence in an abundance of imagery depicting skins being bitten, bled, cut, infected, and whipped. In his representation of white colonists torturing black slaves, skin as a site of feeling also becomes implicated in Stedman's sentimental appropriation of suffering black bodies. Physical and emotional feeling become en- tangled in a wider complex of issues surrounding human identity, and skin becomes a marker for the whole person: a point of nexus for cultural narratives of the body and identity in terms of beauty, feeling, gender, health, and race. Understanding skin as the colonial frame for the social narration of the human body, this essay focuses on Stedman's fascination with it: first, to contextualize its significance as a site of feeling and a marker of human difference; and second, to shed light on Stedman's parallel concern for the integrity of the text, emphasizing the motif of skin as symbolic of his related concerns for the whole body and the whole text. STEDMAN'S SURINAME Born in 1744 to a Dutch mother and a Scottish father, Stedman grew up in the Netherlands and Scotland. In 1772, having inherited his father's commission as an officer in the Scots Brigade of the Dutch Army, Stedman was recruited by the Dutch States-General as one of an initial corps of eight hundred soldiers to assist the Suriname planters in destroying the Maroon societies that had been engaged in regular bouts of warfare with European settlers since the arrival of the English in 1651. In the 1760s, their inability to overpower the Maroons had forced the planters to sign peace treaties guaranteeing Maroon independence. But the trea- ties only encouraged more slaves to escape, and soon the Suriname economy was threatened by decreasing numbers of slaves. The beleaguered local forces were unable to cope with the regular ambushes staged upon plantations by new groups of Maroon guerrillas, and by the 1770s the rebel activities threatened to bring the colonial plantation system to the point of collapse.9 Stedman claims that only a single sailor on the Dutch expedition escaped illness (N, 607). Widespread disease was compounded by military incompetence, poor resources, and hopelessly inadequate medical care. After one particularly fruitless battle, Stedman finds himself "left to defend a whole River with none but seek [sick] People, without even sufficient Ammunition, and who were hourly expiring for want of proper Medicines or even so much as a Surgeon" (N, 154). Not only do the illnesses of both soldiers and slaves form an almost constant part of the text, but Stedman himself is so often feverish, bleeding, and in pain that his state of ill health functions as the lens through which he views the world. The Narrative's bodies - human, animal, and vegetable - are dismembered, dissected, rotting, and generally opened up and pieced apart. Disease is woven from content into form as Stedman leapfrogs between his key themes of illness, military detail, natural history, the romance plot, and the abuse of black slaves. The disconcertingly abrupt narrative shifts between the gruesome symptoms of tropical disease and</page><page sequence="4">42 Eighteenth -Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 other aspects of colonial life mirror the discomfiting tide of sickness suffered by Stedman and his fellow soldiers. Disease is both a constant of his life and a strange interruption into the narration of his experiences; the Narrative is symptomatic inasmuch as the text, like the colonial body, is fragmented and disordered. Indeed, narrative or plot did not exist in Stedman's four original diaries from which the Narrative was produced; the history of the text is marked by his repeated efforts over many years to achieve a complete account of his experiences, despite a troublesome editorial process. On his return from Suriname in 1777, Stedman spent some years rewriting the diaries he had kept as the 1790 manuscript version of the Narrative, and received an offer from publisher Joseph Johnson.10 William Thomson was employed to edit Stedman's manuscript and, as the Prices show, made significant changes reflecting his own proslavery views (N, lx-lxv). Sted- man bitterly resented Thomson's editing, recording his displeasure in his diary: "my book mard intirely."11 Despite Stedman's efforts to correct the "lies &amp; preachings" inserted by Thomson,12 the Narrative finally published in 1796 was significantly different from the 1790 manuscript.13 Stedman's reformation of his diaries into a single text and the obvious resentment he felt at the changes to the manuscript sug- gest his desire to represent his experiences as a comprehensive, unitary story, and mark the difference between the epigrammatic parts represented by the brief diary entries and the more fluid whole of the 1790 manuscript. Stedman's alterations shed light on his efforts to transform his fragmentary and tumultuous life in Suriname into a stable narrative for readers' consumption; this concern for the unity of his text runs parallel to his preoccupation with the unity of colonial bodies. INSIDE/OUT: THE POROSITY OF SKIN From the leaky bodies of European soldiers suffering from the bloody flux, whose "Filth for Want of Assistance was Dreeping though their Hammocks" (N, 419), to the "decay'd &amp; Corrupted Carcasses" (N, 530) of slaves suffering from yaws,14 Stedman imagines disease in terms of corrosion. "Not a Man Was to be Seen," he writes, "Without Agues, Fevers, Rotten Limbs &amp;c." (N, 367) European soldiers, Africans, and the Creole gentry are described respectively as "Scarcrows" (N, 451), "skin and bone" (N, 528), and "wither'd mortals" (N, 49). An endless stream of living corpses and their atrophying parts appears as colonial bodies are depicted as polluted and decaying. Leprosy, of course, was a much-dreaded cause of bodily decay widespread in the tropics; describing its effects on the sufferer, Sted- man writes: "the breath Stinks, the hair falls out, and the fingers and Toes becoming Putrid drop off Joynt after Joynt, till they Expire" (N, 530). Rod Edmond argues in Leprosy and Empire that the image of the leper is especially fearsome because the disease undermines the integrity of the body, and, therefore, the category of the human.15 This concern with bodily integrity fuels the Narrative's imagery of colonial bodies literally falling apart. The grotesque image of the leper's slowly decompos- ing body mirrors Stedman's own body in his premature vision of his burial. The idea of the leprous body decaying even before death highlights Stedman's morbid sense of the colonial body in a process of disintegration. Stedman's fears for his own physical unity are revealed in the meticulous record of each illness to which he succumbs. February 1776, for example, sees him ill with "a Bad Foot, A Sore Arm, the Prickly Heat, and all my Teeth Loose with</page><page sequence="5">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 43 the Scurvey" (N, 469). The loss of skin through illness and injury is of particular concern: "my Ancle Which had been Nearly Recover'd Was Now wounded Afresh to the Bone, the Skin and Flesh being quite torn Away" (N, 370). Another passage documents his narrow escape from a group of rebel slaves, leaving him with "the Loss of the Skin on one of my Shins" (N, 327). Each small loss signifies the body's vulnerability, marking out the skin as in need of particular protection. Following the example of a group of slaves assisting the troops, Stedman goes barefoot to prevent the rot which plagued those men walking in boots through marshes and swamps: "in this respect I had fairly the start of them all my Skin being, the swel'd foot, or Consaka and a few Scratches excepted, perfectly whole from my habit of walking thus, while not a sound limb was to be found amongst the rest which were running in open Sores and Corruption" (N, 221-22). From these wounds, Stedman writes, "some lost their limbs and others even their Lives" (N, 222). The skin's protective role, as well as its susceptibility to disease, make keeping it "perfectly whole" crucial to tropical survival. Stedman's epitaph, in which his entire skin remains long after the decomposition of his flesh, is, therefore, a fantasy which replaces in death the skin he is so anxious about losing in life. Stedman's preoccupation invokes the contemporary medical focus on skin as a principle disease site. It was during the second half of the eighteenth century that dermatology emerged as an important field of medical practice, as such physi- cians as Joseph Plenck and Robert Willan began classifying skin diseases following a Linnaean methodology.16 In his cultural and scientific history The Book of Skin, Steven Connor writes that the period marked a shift in medical thought: "the functions of the skin as integument and screen, covering the body and expressing the complexion of the soul, began to give way to a second phase, a more mechani- cal conception of the skin as a membrane."17 From its medieval incarnation as a covering which provided the protective boundary between the self and the world, eighteenth-century skin became an organ in itself, made up of many small parts. "All these minute parts," wrote the British physician Seguin Henry Jackson, "con- stitute a most complicated organ, endowed with a high irritability, and indubitably of great importance to the animal machine, both in sickness and in health."18 As a permeable layer transporting toxins between the body and the outside world, skin was now imagined as a pervious barrier and a mediating structure for disease. Its excretive function made skin the visible register of internal corruption; the surface of the body, therefore, could be read for signs of disease. A pallid skin, for example, suggested all manner of illnesses, from food poisoning to nervous disorders. In Stedman's Narrative, skin reveals the dreadful symptoms of tropical disease. Besides yaws and leprosy, another common contagious disease with cuta- neous symptoms was ringworm. In September 1773 Stedman made the following brief entry in his journal: "I have got the ringworm of which I soon get the better by an excellent receipt."19 The Narrative expands on this with a detailed descrip- tion of ringworm, which "consists in large scarlet irregular Spots particularly on the under parts of the body, and which increase in Magnitude from Day to Day, unless prevented by timely application - these Spots are surrounded with a kind of hard, Scrufulous border, that makes them look in my opinion something like land-Maps and which are troublesome by their itching . . . inconceivable are the many troubles to which one is exposed in this Climate" (N, 163).</page><page sequence="6">44 Eighteenth -Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 The move from the description of symptoms to cartographic imagery to climatic reference is highly suggestive. The science of medical geography had institutionalized a focus on pathogenic places, providing a conceptual framework for the association of disease with the tropical colonies.20 For Stedman, the fear that he and his company would find themselves "murdered by a Combination of misery &amp;c an Unhealthy Climate" (N, 569) was ever present. Drawing on this relationship between disease and climatic location, his "skin map" might even be read as one of Suriname - the image of the colony emerging on the skin of the sufferer, providing tangible evidence of the deleterious effects of tropical climates. This geographical image on the surface of the skin is also a symptom of the suf- ferer being medically colonized, as the European body infected with ringworm carries the mark of the colony on its skin - a significant medical metaphor in the context of anxiety regarding the possibility of European physiological and social creolization. The association between disease and geosocial environment engen- ders a narrative flourish which brings disease into the realm of the figurative. The physical presence of Stedman's diseased body, largely absent from the diary entry, changes significantly in the rewritten passage in which attention is drawn to the damaged or infected part as bearing the mark of the tropical climate. While Sted- man's diaries represent the illness in terms of a causal narrative of disease and cure, the Narrative develops a sense of the diseased body and its symptoms - and of skin itself - as being entangled in other social and scientific narratives. As it becomes colonized by climate and disease, Stedman's skin registers the changes his body undergoes in Suriname, as well as his investment in using skin as a central theme for his rewritten Narrative. CLIMATE AND COMPLEXION Skin was increasingly understood as mobile and subject to change accord- ing to external conditions, and its susceptibility to climatic variation was a pressing concern. American progressive and monogenist Samuel Stanhope Smith wrote in An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1787) that extremes of temperature could alter the balance and appearance of the skin: "when heat or cold predominates in any region ... it impresses, in the same proportion, a permanent and characteristical complexion. . . . this cause will affect the nerves by tension or relaxation, by dilatation or contraction - It will affect the fluids by increasing or lessening the perspiration, and by altering the proportions of the secretions - It will peculiarly affect the skin by the immediate operation of the atmosphere. "21 Illustrating the developing idea of skin as a porous and volatile structure, Smith highlights the connection between this new functional model of skin and the increasing significance of climatic effects on complexion. Roxann Wheeler has provided evidence of the semiotic abundance of the term "complexion" in its eighteenth-century usage.22 Stedman sees the negative effects of climate in the "too many Languid Looks, Sallow Complexions, deform'd Bod- ies, and Broken Constitutions, of our European Contriwomen" (N, 369). The wan looks of white women contrast unfavorably with the "Shining skin and Remark- able Cleanliness" (N, 614) of those who have the "Certain Advantage in a Black Complexion" (N, 512). Describing a group of black bargemen, Stedman again emphasizes the healthy appearance of their skin: "all as naked as when they were</page><page sequence="7">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 45 born . . . these men look'd very well - being healthy Strong &amp; young, theyr skin Shining &amp; almost as black as Ebony" (N, 39-41). Stedman's investment in reading black skin as a marker of health articulates the convergence of aesthetic, medical, and racial significance in the term "complexion." Referring not only to skin color but also to health and disposition, complexion linked skin to a comprehensive narrative of the whole person. While Stedman associates black skin with health and sexual attractiveness, he views imperfections or irregularities in the skin as morbid and grotesque. He describes albino blacks as "Monsters, such as lately one was Exibited in England, whose Skin was not a Natural White, but Resembling Chalk, nay evern theyr hair on every part was the Same, while theyr Eyes were a Perfect Blood Colour And which they Saw verry Little in the Sun Shine, Neyther were they fit for any kind of Labour, While theyr Mental Faculties Corresponded with the incapacity of their Bodys" (N, 512). In the context of the contemporary emphasis on the relationship between skin color and health, Stedman presumes all sorts of medical and social consequences to result from albinism (or achromia). Eighteenth-century exhibi- tions of albinos and vitíligo sufferers such as Jamaican John Boby, the "Wonderful Spotted Indian," captured the public imagination. James Parsons's "Account of the White Negro Shewn Before the Royal Society" (1765) describes several black albinos being displayed as "rarities" to the public.23 As Charles D. Martin writes in The White African American Body, the white skin of the audiences who flocked to see these exhibitions took on new dimensions in the image of the white black body: "the transparency of whiteness, its pretensions to naturalness, ends in the body of this white mimic."24 Unpigmented black skin confirms the antecedence of whiteness, rendering blackness a secondary accretion, but simultaneously contains the possibility that the white patches are the secondary layer. For Stedman, the albino African body models whiteness as the color of corruption and disease. Un- derlining the association between skin and medical models of the racialized body, the albino also registers the dangerous elasticity of skin color and undermines dominant categories of human variation. Stedman's assumption that albinism was indicative of poor health registers the late-eighteenth-century move from an interest in surface variation toward a new emphasis on the depth, structure, and function of skin. He is fascinated by skin's potential to reveal the secrets of racial difference. Shifting his attention from the damage inflicted upon his own skin by disease and injury, Stedman moves on to the dissection of African skins: "the Epidermis or Cuticle of the Negroes I have Seen Dissected more than once, this is very Clear and Transparent, but between which and the Real Skin lies a thin Follicle which is perfectly Black, and when Removed by verry Severe Scalding or Flagellation, Exposes a Complexion not inferior to that of the European" (N, 512). This variegated model of skin follows the anatomical discovery described by Robert Boyle and others that skin comprised three layers: the outer, transparent layer; the middle pigmented layer; and the innermost layer - which was always white.25 The evidence presented by anatomists and physicians showing that people of all races had an inner layer of whiteness at the core made sense within a monogenetic theory of racial origins while sustaining the priority of whiteness. If the anatomical comparison between African and European skins posi- tions the white complexion as the original skin, the contrast between Stedman's</page><page sequence="8">46 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 anxiety for the loss of his own skin and his more analytical, detached description of the dissection of black skins is even less equitable. In the above passage, the act of dissection and the passive voice in which he describes it depersonalize the point from which text and reader view the human body. The investigation of African bodies at this level of focus anatomizes human difference, reducing the dissected black body to the sum of its parts. Changing focus from the loss of his own skin to the removal of others', Stedman simultaneously alters his rhetoric from the personal to the anatomical. This seamless move from the fear of his own skin falling away to the scientific interest in the dissection of African skin highlights Stedman's projection of his fear for his own physical integrity onto other colonial bodies. For him, the relationship between skin and human variety is different from that between skin and disease. While in medical terms skin was the surface upon which disease was writ, that surface could reveal or conceal racial origins and other layers of meaning. The epidermis might signify one racial identity, while what lay underneath exposed another. This is not to suggest that blackness does not constitute for Stedman a very real material and social difference from whiteness - his many ethnographic passages bear witness to this fact. It does suggest, however, his concern regarding the unstable structure of skin. The anatomical distinction between the epidermis and the dermis - or "real skin," as Stedman calls it - highlights this ambiguity. As both surface covering and inner "real" component, skin is a body part like no other. THE BODY WITHOUT SKIN If dissected skin tells the story of the body in terms of its constituents, and of the skin as a part within a part, then skin stripped from the body works along slightly different narrative lines. Stedman repeats an account told to him of a rebel slave named Joli Coeur who seeks revenge on his former plantation master, a brutal man who has raped Joli Coeur's mother and flogged his father. Joli Coeur hangs, beheads, and flays him, before laying the entire skin over a cannon to dry (N, 271). Skinning, here, appears to be the ultimate act of violence. Subsequently, Stedman repeatedly returns to the image of the excoriated body in his descriptions of other violent scenes. Mesmerized by the sight of the horrendous abuses inflicted upon slaves, Stedman imagines these scenes as enacting the complete removal of the victims' skins. A common plantation punishment involved the victim being beaten with branches "till the Verry Flesh is Cut Away - he is then Turn'd over on the Other Side Where the Same Dreadful Flagelation is inflicted till not a Bit of Skin is Left, and the Spot of Execution is died over With his Blood" (N, 556). In another passage, a woman is "Skinned alive" in a vicious whipping by a ruthless overseer (N, 266). After such whippings, Stedman reports that slaves are "Left to Cure themselv's or Continue to do theyr Work Without a Skin" (N, 531). Captivated by the skinless living body, Stedman repeats the image so often that it becomes an objectified symbol of the horrors of colonial existence. In these passages, skin as a site of feeling becomes bound up with the dual expression of fascination and sympathy associated with the sight of the suffering other. Marcus Wood has framed Stedman's images of violence against slaves as sentimentalized "pornography."26 Certainly, there is an unsettling blend of pain and desirability in the image of the "beautiful Samboe Girl of about eighteen" who is "tied up by both arms to a tree ... as naked as she came into the World,</page><page sequence="9">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 47 and lacerated in such a shocking Condition by the Whips of two Negro Drivers, that she was from her neck to her Ancles literally dyed over with blood" (N, 264). The image presents the suffering woman as an eroticized spectacle, set up for sympathetic consumption by a readership heavily invested in what Wood identifies as a post-Burkeian aesthetic mode in which witnessing torture is a sublime experi- ence.27 As Wood argues, the many representations of suffering slaves must be read in the context of the popular interest in sympathy and the morality of sentiment.28 Wood's argument that Stedman's accounts of the physical abuse of slaves oper- ate "in a world of pure fantasy," however, obscures the reality of Stedman's daily existence.29 The descriptions of slaves in pain are voyeuristic, but they should also be interpreted in the context of Stedman's very immediate fear for his own life and health. Alan Bewell sees Stedman's focus on the violence inflicted upon slaves and soldiers as suggesting that slavery and military service are "almost identical - both being structured by an enormous loss of life, by loss of liberty, and by lack of social justice."30 Stedman's own diseased and injured body is mapped onto that of the tortured slave body through the focal point of skin as the site of feeling. The motif of the body alive and totally divested of its skin is both a projection of Stedman's fears for the loss of his own skin and an expression of the fragility of all bodies in the violent and unstable colony of Suriname. Stedman's interest in the dissection and removal of human skins is mirrored in the frequent skinning of animals. Like tortured slaves, Stedman's animals often remain living after they have been flayed. On witnessing a black man skinning a large snake, Stedman writes of the "terrible appearance, viz, to See a Man Stark naked, black and bloody, clung with Arms and legs around the Slimy and yet liv- ing Monster" (N, 147). The flayed body of the snake is a troubling sight, and the nakedness of the black man carrying out the skinning serves only to enlarge the alarming nakedness of the writhing, skinless creature. Stedman is enthralled by the terrible appearance of the living body without its skin, an image which resonates with the contemporary interest in the causes and mechanisms of movement and sentience expressed by animisi, mechanist, and vitalist claims about the proper- ties of life and physiological phenomena. The idea of the "vital spark" of life as self-determining and independent of the body attracted attention in the 1770s and '80s, and prompted a debate over whether or not the soul was coextensive with the corporeal form. Robert Whytt's Essay on the Vital and Other Involuntary Mo- tions of Animals (1751) contains a passage similar to Stedman's description of the giant snake. Whytt examines vipers that remain alive after their skin, head, and entrails have been removed, in order to demonstrate his theory that "the motions of the separated parts of animals are owing to the soul or sentient principle still continuing to act in them."31 Set alongside Whytt's viper and the Narrative's flayed human bodies, Stedman's skinned snake participates in a set of ongoing discussions about the cause and location of sentience, and raises questions about animal and human capacities for feeling. The bizarre abundance of living bodies completely divested of their skins also begs the questions: just what is the body without skin? If the flayed body continues to respond to stimuli, what has been lost in the act of skinning? Sted- man not only removes the skins of dead animals; in the tradition of the gentleman explorer, he keeps them as souvenirs. These tokens of colonial adventure suggest</page><page sequence="10">48 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 his desire to retain the image of the living whole, just as those snake skins preserved in the British Museum might "give some Account of the Animal itself" (N, 148). As the external image of the body, skin stands in figuratively for the whole. It is the medium through which humans interact with the world, the sensible form of corporeal being, and an important focal point for eighteenth-century theories of sensitivity and feeling - both emotional and physical. As the body's public form, skin is responsible for expressive function; without it, the self has no worldly form or recognizable appearance. Stedman's focus on the skinned body serves as a reminder that the whole is no longer in existence, and that bodies in Suriname are rarely intact. Dissection might reveal truths about the body, but, if skin is the symbolic image of the body whole, then its removal also marks the confusion of that image. While imperfections in the skin indicate the deleterious effects of climate, disease, or a weak constitution, the loss of one's skin marks the loss of the structural boundary between the self and the world. This loss undermines the integrity of the human, and, in the context of Stedman's efforts to read the skin for signs of health, illness, race, and suffering, its removal renders the body illegible. NARRATIVES OF BODY AND TEXT If skin raises issues regarding beauty, disease, identity - and, perhaps most of all, the capacity to suffer and the integrity of the colonial body - it also has a role to play in terms of the textual unity of the Narrative. The 1790 manuscript was not produced from Stedman's diaries by a simple act of textual merger; many new passages were inserted, and others rewritten. Evolving from the sparse diary entries detailing the houses where he dined, the women he bedded, and the diseases he contracted, the Narrative became a wide-ranging reflection on many aspects of life in the colonial military and on the Suriname plantations. Despite Stedman's best efforts at creating a cohesive whole, however, reading the Narrative is an oddly disjointed experience. The end of June 1773, for example, sees him wheel hurriedly from a natural historical account of sheep (which, notably, includes a description of the animal when skinned); to a detailed description of "dry gripes" (a stomach complaint causing pain and yellowing of the skin); to lamenting the absence of a quarter of his 530-strong corps from sickness and death; to a discussion of electric eels, and, finally, to the description of a slave driver mercilessly beating a young slave woman (N, 113-15). In part, Stedman's abrupt thematic turns are a consequence of the editorial process; the Narrative is formed as a strange hybrid of diary entries within novelistic chapters, revealing its origins as a travel journal of the most rough- and-ready kind. However, these spasmodic changes of topic also reveal the extent to which images of dissected and sickly skins dominate Stedman's vision of Suriname. The suddenness of his shifts between natural history, illness, death, and violence hints at the way in which skins - human and animal, black and white, sickly and healthy - become the focal point of the text and draw together the themes of the Narrative in a vision of damaged, dying, and sick bodies. As Stedman moves from sheep skin, to diseased skin, to bleeding skin, the repetition of images of disease and violence conceptually enfolds all the Narrative's themes under the rubric of the vulnerable colonial body through the linking image of skin. The focus of scholarly attention on the changes made to Stedman's account in the 1790 text has been the alteration of his relationship with Joanna from its</page><page sequence="11">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 49 representation in the diaries as brief and sexual to its emergence in the Narrative as a great romance with a suitably tragic ending.32 While Stedman's original diaries are notable for their lack of feeling, critics have emphasized the use of sentimental modes of expression in the Narrative. Jenny Sharpe notes that Stedman's sentimental tone frames the rewritten version of his relationship with Joanna in terms of a set of racialized gender norms revolving around domestic ideals of womanhood.33 Werner Sollors argues that Stedman's romanticization of his relationship with Joanna self- consciously "functions as an answer and a specific corrective" to Richard Steele's version of the tale of Inkle and Yarico, in which the faithless Inkle sells his beloved into slavery.34 For Sollors, Stedman's sentimentalized version of the story establishes the moral legitimacy of his ameliorative stance on slavery, which is "made plausible by a focus on its defiance of the patterns of previous fiction."35 Another key theme to which feeling is added retrospectively is that of the violent punishments exacted upon black slaves. While the diary entry for 22 May 1773 records in extremely succinct terms seven black men being executed, Sted- man adds to the Narrative an account of physical and sympathetic suffering. He is "surprized at the intrepidity with which the Negroes bore theyr Punishment," finding that his own sympathetic feelings are so roused by the terrible sight that he suffers more than the slaves appear to: "how much I was hurted at the cruelty of the above execution" (N, 103). While Stedman is sympathetically "hurted" by the sight of the execution, his sympathy seems incongruous with his claim (in keeping with medical theories of black insensibility) that even the slave who is "broke alive upon the rack" (N, 102) does not exhibit any signs of pain. The violent passages in the Narrative are characterized by Stedman's efforts to enlarge his own capacity for sympathetic feeling, often at the expense of accounting for the bodily suffering of the slaves he witnesses being brutally tortured and killed. Much as his scientific dissection of black skins ignores the element of pain, in the passages detailing torture the physical pain of slaves becomes metamorphosed into Stedman's own emotional suffering. If the images of corrupted and diseased skins are symptomatic in terms of their effect on the structure of the Narrative, so too does the idea of skin as the origin of physical and sympathetic feeling lend imaginative impulse to Stedman's attempt to rewrite his diaries as a sentimental narrative. As Wood argues, Stedman's mode of expression is a sentimental style which foregrounds the spectacle of pain as a predominant social concern, and the focus on his own sympathetic suffering represents a self-conscious endeavor to become a colonial "Man of Feeling."36 The Narrative includes references to such authors as Oliver Goldsmith and Laurence Sterne, and quotes from Tobias Smol- lett's Roderick Random (N, 208) - with Stedman often adopting the tone of the picaresque romantic hero. The incorporation of literary figures connected with the representation of emotion reflects the fact that feeling plays a major role in the thematic and stylistic processes of reconstructing the diaries as narrative. The eighteenth-century sentimental emerged as a literary mode in close association with the representation of slavery, and passages similar to Stedman's can be seen in abolitionist texts configured to engage a sympathetic reader. For example, the Bermudian slave Mary Prince's account of her experiences, edited by Thomas Pringle and published in 1831 as an abolitionist tract, includes descriptions of violence also focusing on the skin as the site of suffering. Prince's mistress regularly inflicted</page><page sequence="12">50 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 whippings and beatings on her slave: "[t]o strip me naked - to hang me up by the wrists and lay my flesh open with the cow-skin, was an ordinary punishment for even a slight offence."37 Just as Stedman's Narrative was published in the period leading up to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Prince's History proved to be a significant and controversial text in the years immediately preceding the 1833 Act abolishing slavery in most of the British Empire. Having run to three editions within a year, subsequent versions of the History included additional testimonials on Prince's behalf and an appended letter describing "the marks of former ill-usage on Mary Prince's person."38 Clearly, skin as the visible site of pain and suffering has a piv- otal function in addressing the sympathetic reader. While Prince and her editor invite the abolitionist reader to empathize with her physical suffering, however, the disturbing lack of physical feeling in Stedman's scenes of dissection and torture is situated in stark contrast to his own sentimental assumption of the pain of oth- ers. Feeling - both emotional and physical, and often mediated through the skin as the origin of sensitivity - forms the centerpiece on which Stedman hangs the rewriting of his Narrative, as well as the construction of his own persona in rela- tion to the treatment of slaves. Stedman uses the sentimental to both appropriate and negate black suffering. Just as his interest in the relationship between skin and the integrity of colonial bodies sheds light on the stylistic fabric of the Narrative, the focus on skin, physical feeling, and sympathy is used to rewrite the text in the sentimental mode. Recent work on the relationship between eighteenth-century sentiment and slavery has framed the sentimental in functional terms. While Lynn Festa has described the particular kinds of cultural work done by the sentimental in produc- ing and framing the complex of social issues surrounding slavery, Brycchan Carey has addressed the sentimental language of British abolitionist authors as political rhetoric.39 On Stedman's rewriting of his diaries as the Narrative, Werner Sollors emphasizes the "sentimental strategies" of the 1790 text, while Marcus Wood refers to Stedman's "sentimentalist agendas."40 Acknowledging the notorious difficulty of defining the sentimental, Festa understands the mode to be produced within just the kind of retrospective movement characterizing Stedman's rewritten Narrative: "[sentimental language bestows coherent shape upon otherwise inchoate feelings by decanting them into contained linguistic vessels. Only retroactively does affective experience become intelligible."41 This model of the sentimental as a retroactive linguistic structure - one which makes sense in the context of hindsight - suggests the function of the sentimental in Stedman's 1790 manuscript in producing the distinction between the diaries and the Narrative. The romanticized version of Jo- anna and her relationship with Stedman helps to configure the text in terms of plot and emotion. The terrible scenes of slave suffering, meanwhile, invite his intended "Feeling reader" (N, 618) into the text by offering a series of prompts to take up the role of sentimental voyeur and to explore a range of emotional responses to the Narrative's violent imagery. If, however, affective representation offers a way to make sense out of the chaos of Suriname, the proximity between emotion and violence in Stedman's colonial sentimental mode complicates his invitation to the sympathetic reader. Feeling is marked by its expression alongside scenes of horrific colonial violence.</page><page sequence="13">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 51 Stedman's portrayal of Joanna uses the sentimental, as Tassie Gwilliam puts it, to "convert the horrors of slavery and colonial interactions into the softer pangs of love sorrow."42 However, sentiment breaks down as the "contamination of 'romance' and the domestic by colonial violence together serve to reveal the holes in sentimentality."43 If the "holes" in Stedman's appropriation of black suffering are exposed by his unnerving graphic descriptions of colonial violence, so too are the Narrative's textual "holes" revealed in its abrupt shifts in subject matter and tone. In a typically conflicted passage, Stedman gives an account of a ranger who is captured by a rebel leader named Baron and suffers the punishment of his ears, nose, and lips being cut off (N, 85).44 Realizing the potential effects of such frequent gruesome scenes, Stedman expresses his wish to "diversify the mind of the reader after the preceeding Scenes of Horror" (N, 87). To his mind, the most fitting way of doing so is to offer a description of "the beautiful Mulatto Maid Joanna" (N, 87). Predictably, this description comes in the form of praise for Joanna's complexion and features. But while Stedman pauses to describe Joanna's vermillion skin and shapely lips and nose, the aestheticized image of her pleasing visage is haunted by its negative in the gruesome form of the faceless ranger. As the violence of the colonial battlefield is mapped onto the face of Stedman's beloved, it becomes ap- parent that beauty is another signifier entangled in the complicated web of disease, race, and violence that makes skin the focal point of Stedman's colonial experience. The slippage between Joanna's aestheticized mulatto skin and the skinless, formless face of the ranger unsettles Stedman's romanticized construction of her. If Sted- man's romantic reshuffling of the relationship in the 1790 manuscript marks his investment in the Narrative as narrative, the faceless ranger as the mirror image of Joanna's exoticized beauty impedes the production of that narrative. The juxtaposition of images of romance with those of extreme violence complicates Stedman's sentimental endeavors. As we have seen, he finds himself sympathetically "hurted" (N, 103) by the sight of seven black slaves being executed. Yet perhaps more surprising than Stedman's emphasis on his own sympathetic pangs is the fact that the passage also includes an account of the sympathetic black executioner responsible for "scurging" a white sailor (N, 103).45 "I ought not to omit," he writes, "that the Negro who flog'd the White Man inflicted the Punish- ment with the greatest Marks of Comisseration all which almost had induced me to deside between the Europeans and Africans in this Colony - that the first were the greatest barbarians of the two" (N, 103). In the context of Stedman's ambiva- lent views on the institution of slavery, the sudden transformation of the whipped body - and the object of sympathy - from black to white raises questions about the relationship between sympathetic feeling and colonial slavery. Sympathy, after all, is premised on the existence of a culturally appropriate object, and the reversal of racially determined sympathetic roles alters the function of sympathetic repre- sentation in a colonial context. If Stedman uses the sentimental appropriation of slave suffering to portray himself as a man of feeling and to make narrative sense of colonial violence, this confusion of the sympathetic object displaces his well- practiced emotional response. The revision of the diaries in terms of skin, race, sentiment, and violence finds its bewildering apex in a passage describing Stedman brutally killing a pair of monkeys. On 21 August 1773 Stedman's diary gives the following bare statement:</page><page sequence="14">52 Eighteenth -Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 "have the whole day a violent fever."46 In the Narrative, Stedman edits in a descrip- tion of Joanna nursing Stedman lovingly back to health, before collapsing into a torturous passage of violence, guilt, sympathy, dissection, and scientific racism. In an account not recorded in the diaries, he describes shooting two black monkeys for food. Having fatally wounded one of them, Stedman "swong him round and knock'd his head against the Sides of the Canoo with such a force, that I was covered all over with blood and brains." Still alive, though, the monkey "looked at me in the most Pitiful manner that can be conceived, I knew no other Means to end this Murder than by holding him under Water till he was drown'd, while my heart felt Seek on his account. Here his dying little Eyes still Continued to follow me with seeming reproach till their light gradually forsook them" (N, 141). Sted- man stakes his usual claim on suffering, exclaiming: "never Poor Devil felt more than I on this occasion" (N, 141). This time, however, the object of sympathy is not human. The passage takes up the contemporary fascination with monkeys' proximity to humans, exemplified in such work on comparative anatomy as that of Pieter Camper. Once again taking up his anatomizing lens, Stedman claims that "[i]f wisely viewed and deserted," the comparison between African and orangutan bodies reveals the "wonderfull chain of Gradation" (N, 144). The juxtaposition of human and animal suffering contributes to emerging eighteenth-century discussions concerning the feelings of animals and the increasing focus on their capacity to suf- fer and their function as sympathetic objects, a history that has been documented recently by Markman Ellis, Lynn Festa, Jonathan Lamb, and David Perkins.47 By raising questions about what it meant to be human, as Laura Brown has argued, animals "helped Europeans imagine Africans, Native Americans and themselves."48 From Gulliver's Houyhnhnms and their enslaved Yahoos to Yorick's caged starling, anthropomorphized animals were being used in fiction to take the measure of fellow feeling and to explore the politics of slavery one step removed from reality. While much of the Narrative describes violence against slaves, this pas- sage portrays Stedman reenacting colonial violence upon the monkey - the next best thing, it appears, to an African. Stedman's displacement of sympathy from the African to the monkey frames the passage in terms of a sentimental mode George Boulukos has described as concerned with using emotional response to escape re- sponsibility for colonial acts of torture.49 As Debbie Lee argues, the combination of scientific racism and the humanized animal in this passage suggests its importance to the rest of the Narrative-, "the monkey accuses Stedman of the same kinds of crimes Stedman performs against the revolted Negroes, but for which Stedman seems to feel no guilt whatsoever."50 As the dying monkey views Stedman with "seeming reproach" (N, 141), the word "seeming" reveals that Stedman's sympathy for the animal is also "seeming," because it is based not on actual humanity but on what Stedman calls the monkey's "Mock-Mimicry of the Human" (N, 328). The monkey as imitative of the human forms an illusory object of sympathy, and the confusion over whether it is the monkey or its African proxy that constitutes the sympathetic object disrupts Stedman's sentimental response. Moreover, the humanization of the monkey simultaneously dehumanizes the African, conveying the latter into the realm of "Mock-Mimicry of the Human." The association Sted- man constructs between the monkey and the African also casts a different light</page><page sequence="15">Senior / "Perfectly Whole" 53 on his claim to sympathetic suffering on behalf of the tortured and dying black individuals who populate the Narrative. Stedman's emotional response to the dying monkey does not prevent him from again interpreting the experience through the grotesque image of the skinned body: "I have eat them boild, roasted, and stew'd, and found their flesh white juicy and Good; the only thing which disgusted me - being their little hands, and their heads, which when dress'd by being depriv'd of the Skin look like the hands and the Skull of a young infant - " (N, 141 ). The comparison between the monkey and the African body, and that between the skinned monkey and the body of a small child, not only make for uncomfortable reading but also again obscure the object of sympathy. As the passage progresses from killing an animal for food to murder and on to infanticide and cannibalism, any sense of affinity between Stedman and his reader is dissolved. Just as the proximity between Joanna's exoticized skin and the ranger's skinless face haunts Stedman's sentimental representation of his beloved, so the blurred boundaries between monkey skin, black skin, and baby skin leave a question mark over just what - or whom - is the object of sympathy. Revealed in this passage's complex of anthropomorphism, emotion, ethnography, illness, natural history, and racial science is the problem of the relationship between feeling and violence that Stedman imposes upon his text in rewriting the diaries in sentimental terms. He offers his reader a range of sympathetic objects, which usually take the form of humans and animals with their skin removed in varying degrees. The confusion of these objects, as well as the tension created between sen- timent and violence, forestall any straightforward identification of the reader with either Stedman or the objects of his sympathy. Stedman's ambiguous, disfigured, and leaking skins complicate the entry of the "Feeling reader" (N, 618) into the Narrative. The attempt to stabilize textual meaning by framing the Narrative in terms of emotion proves to be in vain as corrupted and violated bodies irrupt and renegotiate Stedman's story at every turn. Skin is the objectified locus on which Stedman hangs the themes of beauty, disease, feeling, race, sexuality, and violence. As the point of mediation between the body and the rest of the world, skin has a crucial role in the production of medical and social narratives of the human. In Stedman's colonial context, skin is also an important social prompt for sympathetic emotion, and ideas about feeling underpin his dual concern for skin and text. Documenting the way in which the eighteenth-century fascination with skin plays out in this colonial environment, the Narrative reveals the ambiguity and vulnerability of skin as a social and sympathetic marker. Against a backdrop of concerns about colonial disease, creolization, and imperial violence, Stedman's skinless and decaying bodies suggest the tropics as a site of pathology not just for the body, but also for the self - and, indeed, for the text. Stedman attempts to master the disconnectedness of the colonial experience through a vision of bodily and narrative wholes, which, however, cannot help but reveal their diseased, decaying, and dissected parts.

Medical geography, the science of identifying diseases found in particular regions, came to the forefront of medical practice in the late eighteenth century. See Nicolaas A.

Colonial medical geography tended to associate disease with tropical climates, rendering a conceptual separation between the supposedly "healthy" European climate and the "sickly" tropical environment. While for many doctors race played a part in defining susceptibilities to illness, it was climate which was widely believed to be the primary causal factor of disease.
