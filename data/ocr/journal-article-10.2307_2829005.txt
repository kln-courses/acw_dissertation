The cytoskeleton of migratory cells is the subject of intense study by molecular biologists and bio- chemists, and slowly we are learning some of the internal molecular mechanisms and controls that direct cell movement. But the locomotion and mor- phogenetic migration of cells in living organisms is not solely a function, for example, of actin-capping proteins; there must be, and there are, higher or- der rules and regulations that direct cellular traf- fic. J. M. Lackie has managed to survey the field of cell movement from the points of view of the camps of molecular biology and cell behavior and has come up with a very readable textbook that should be a stimulating introduction to the subject for students and postdoctoral researchers alike. Some of the flavor (and philosophy) of the book is illustrated by the following extract: "If, in our over- all analogy, we were to grub up a 20 mile length of dual-carriageway road (expressway) complete with the cars . . . and were then to grind up this material, what would our chances be of discover- ing the internal combustion engine, let alone its mechanism?" Lackie's analogy, that moving cells are like automobiles whose behavior is governed by the condition of the road and the local traffic laws, as well as by their engines, is extensively used and of- ten aids the analysis of a problem. And on occa- sion some more amusing anthropomorphic analo- gies creep in such as the technique of"fist-jamming" by rock climbers being compared to the way neu- trophils move through fibrillar matrices. After an interesting chapter on the ways to ana- lyze cell movement, there is discussion of the mo- lecular interactions of actin, myosin and tubulin that are utilized to generate force in a wide variety of cell types (but no mention of kinesin). But there is coverage of a few more obscure systems that are not usually found in other textbooks on cell movement. The meat of the book is undoubtedly in the sec- ond half where we find a thorough account of the social behavior of cells and an especially good description of the influence of anisotropic environ- ments, such as chemotactic gradients and aligned substrata, on cellular movements. The text is well illustrated with many micro- graphs and stimulating diagrammatical expositions of theoretical points. There is a short glossary (for liberal arts readers?) and a list of about 500 refer- ences, the most recent being in 1984. The author is one of a number of British cell bi- ologists who were associated with the late Michael Abercrombie and who have sustained his philoso- phy and experimental traditions in their own work. This book is evidence that these approaches are lead- ing to greater insights into cell locomotory behavior. JULIAN P.
