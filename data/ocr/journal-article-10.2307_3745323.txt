<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS Materialism and Vitalism in Biology. By Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell, C.B.E., D.Sc, LL.D. (The Herbert Spencer Lecture delivered at Oxford, June 3,1930.) (Oxford: at the Clarendon Press. 1930. Pp. 30. Price 2s.) Fifty years ago Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell read Herbert Spencer's First Principles for the first time, re-reading it again, he tells us, in 1930 in preparation for his lecture. What his impressions were on re-perusal we shall see presently; mean time it is interesting to note the significance of the date 1880. Michael Foster, in his Lectures on the History of Physiology, shows how, during the last three centuries, biology has exhibited alternating phases of materialism and vitalism. Materialism when, under the stimuli of progress in physical science, it made great advances, and vitalism when, those stimuli being exhausted, it marked time. Now the last great period of fertile physio? logical discovery began at about the end of the twenties of the nineteenth century and culminated in the sixties. The great names, Bell, Gall, Wohler, Claude Bernard, du Bois Reymond, Graham, Mayer, Bowman, Ludwig, Helmholtz, and others belong to this period. So do the fundamental dis- coveries and the productive methods of investigation. In pure zoology the great period was the fifties to the eighties. The Origin of Species was pub? lished in the fifties. Between the fifties and the eighties was the phase of morphology under the stimulus of Darwin's hypothesis. In the eighties was Weismann and the fertile notion of the germ-plasm. Since then biology has again marked time, for we cannot lay genetics, mendelism, and biochemistry alongside the great work of physiology in the first half of the century. Our own times are marked out by only two fertile series of investigations: that of Sherrington on the physiology of the nervous system, and that of Galton, Weldon, and Karl Pearson on biometrics. During the years about 1840 to 1860 came the reaction against vitalism, led by Ludwig, Helmholtz, Claude Bernard, and du Bois Reymond. In the nineties came the reaction against materialism, led by Hans Driesch. Since the war the younger generation of biologists, pre-occupied by questions of sex and genetics, have tended to become vitalistic in a "nice" kind of way. In 1880, then, the great days of biological investigation were about run?for a time?yet it must still have been possible then to get the thrill resulting from the triumphs of the materialistic methods of the science. Even now one may faintly have that thrill from the reading of the earlier Huxley Essays. We may, however, suggest that a continual origin for the controversy Materialism versus Vitalism is to be found in the different Welt-Anschauungen adopted by thinkers. Pure unemotional science is interested in the relations between the data of observation and experiment; is contemplative of the order displayed, but is perhaps more conscious of the power which science gives us over our environment. But though science, as William James has said, is now an "idol of the tribe," there is a moreprevalent attitude towards nature. "Listen, oh my son. There is no wisdom like unto the belief in God. He made the world, and shall we liken ourselves to Him by seeking to pene- trate into the mysteries of His creation? Shall we say, Behold this star spinneth round that one, and this other star with a tail goeth and cometh in so many years ? Let it go. He from whose hand it came will guide and direct it." Something like this is the attitude of the majority of men and women, though a certain indifference may characterize their conception of a world which, after all, is good enough as it is. It is true, of course, that lots of people have "an interest in science"?which gives them "something for nothing"! 631</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES Still, even the curious letter quoted above suggests a reason for the "hard materialism" represented by the First Principles. Much of the universe was known, much was unknown but knowable, and much was unknowable. With regard to the latter region, those whom Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell called the "religious and philosophical dogmatists of the last century" had much to teil us. But, he says, the wind of scientific discovery blew coldly on these "shorn lambs", until the reaction of the present phase came, when the lack of power of modern biology "backed the wind to a more element quarter." The dice of scientific data became loaded with "emotional pre- possessions" masquerading as "values." Physics, with regard to the ultimate elements of matter, tended towards indeterminacy and away from the hard- ness of materialism. [Though, as our author acutely observes, this only serves to break down the distinction between the determination of matter and the supposed indeterminacy of life.] Then came telepathy and "spooks," masquerading under Driesch's "parapsychology." The circle has again been rounded, and we cannot doubt that when biology again accepts the stimuius afforded by the modern study of radiational physics it will return to its attitude of a century ago. After fifty years, then, Sir Peter finds that "a materialistic monism is more, not less, credible than when Spencer wrote." We have to deal, he says, with consciousness and a stubborn externality which is not-conscious- ness, and which appears to us in two contrasting sets of phenomena grouped under the terms matter and life, each in its most simple connotation. The theory known as materialism assumes that the phenomena of life are only special cases of the phenomena of matter, and are determined in the same fashion. If we knew all the physical and chemical factors implied in any living phenomenon, we could predict results as certainly as we can those that proceed from a lifeless material arrangement. Just as at every moment inorganic materials are assimilated into the living body of an organism, so, sometime in the past, non-living materials came together and became living systems implying matter and energy and consciousness. Consciousness may have been an emergence from materialistic activities (though Sir Peter rather looks on the term "emergence" as of the nature of the blessed word Mesopotamia "to many persons more earnest than sensible"). After all, it may be "a gift from the unknowable," and it is open to each of us to make his choice. Meanwhile, accurate physiological research resolves the working of the organism into "exquisite mechanism" after exquisite mechanism, and over and over again materialism has proved itself the best working hypothesis of science. There is a hunger after final explanations which is a kind of Protestant, anthropomorphic vanity, at one time reproved by dogmatic religion. Our author neither shares nor sympathizes with this attitude. Do good work in the field and laboratory, he says, and let theory alone. [So, he contends, the theory of hormones explains embryogenic processes! At each stage of development hormones appear and stimulate the course of the succeeding stages.] Obviously we have here the stalwart of the nineteenth- century biological materialism, and when we are tired of speculation and hypotheses that are apt to become the basis of the newer apologetics, the attitude seems the more satisfactory. Yet one doubts that even from the work reviewed a dualism, and not the monism of Spencer results. There is consciousness and that-which-is- not-consciousness and against which life may not ultimately prevail. That which is not consciousness is the passage of nature?all materials and energies tending inevitably, as entropy increases, to their most probable state of disorganization and ultimate chaos. Against this tendency life protests. If 632</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS the organism were only something fully participating in the passage of nature, it would drift unconsciously with the latter as a straw drifts with the current of a river. But obviously the organism resists the drifting towards the degradation of energy?that is what is meant by its assimilation of lifeless matter, by its accelerative reproduction, by its continual adaptations where? by it makes the best of things, and by its utilization of natural energies that would, of themselves, suffer irreversible dissipation. This externality, or absolute natural tendency, which must, in the end, sweep up organic and inorganic alike into chaos is one side of the dualism. The other side is the consciousness which in its dimmest manifestations resists and retards the passage of nature, and in its brightest development comes to know the tendency of the passage. It is what remains in the world, which is already something chaotic, of the original cosmos which the world was. It is very well that this lecture was printed. It is most valuable just now, when there is certainly a softening in the fibre of biological investigation, that some vigorous expression of the fertile, aggressive spirit of the nine? teenth-century biology should be made. In this little booklet that spirit is given expression in the happiest form. It is the hope of the present writer that it may receive the widest possible publicity and circulation. It is unfortunate that the pamphlet is much too dear. Jas. Johnstone.</page></plain_text>
