The window into these processes is the career of Saint John the Baptist, patron saint of French Canadians and national icon from the mid-nineteenth century until 1969, when his statue was destroyed by protesters during the annual parade in his honor in Montréal. Relying on literatures on visuality and materiality, I analyze how the saint and his attending symbols were deployed in processions, parades, and protests. From this analysis, I develop the sociological concept of aesthetic revolt, a process whereby social actors rework iconic symbols, redefining national identity in the process. The article offers a theoretical articulation and an empirical demonstra tion of how the context, content, and the form of specific cultural objects and symbols—national icons—are intertwined in public performance to produce eventful change, and shows why and how the internal material logic and the social life of these icons shape the articulation of new national identities. Keywords Nationalism • Visual culture • Material culture • Historical transformations • Secularization • Québec On June 24th, 1969, a crowd of youthful protesters following the traditional Saint Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montréal, seized and overturned the float dedicated to the patron saint of French Canadians. The large statue of St. John the Baptist fell to the ground, its head breaking off from the body. In the following days, the violent gesture was interpreted and narrated following the biblical story of the saint: It was described in the media and referred to in the public sphere as the "Beheading of the Baptist." The saint thus killed, parades disappeared and new modes of national celebrations were institutionalized. The attack could have been interpreted at the time G.

The attack could also be analyzed today by social scientists as "merely symbolic," reflective of supposedly "deeper" processes. Yet I show here that the proverbial coup de grâce was the last constitutive action in the articulation of a new Québécois national identity, a process in which verbal and physical attacks on the patron saint's icon and its material reworkings throughout the 1960s played an intrinsic role.1 The debates about, and reshaping of, the national icon were part and parcel of the Quiet Revolution, a period of far-reaching social, political, economic and cultural transformations that signifi cantly restructured Québec society and the identity of its French-speaking members. By analyzing icon-making, iconoclastic unmaking, and iconographie remaking of national symbols in one empirical case, this article provides a theoretical articulation of the relationship between the historical context and the ideological-discursive, symbolic-aesthetic, and institutional dimensions of identity transformation. It also offers a methodological blueprint for a cultural sociology of historical change. Theoretical framework, case, and data Scholars of nationalism have felicitously moved away from the study of identity as a constructed yet static thing, to the study of identification, the process through which identities are formed and transformed (e.g., Brubaker 1996; Glaeser 1999; Brubaker and Cooper 2000). A recent body of scholarship has shown how national identifications are at once constructed in everyday life through personal interactions and institutional practices (Brubaker et al. 2006; Fox and Miller-Idriss 2008), but also through specific transformative events (Zubrzycki 2006). While we know from classical sociological texts, the anthropo logical literature, and cultural history that social solidarity is created through the manipula tion of symbols during certain rituals and performances, and that these manipulations can sometimes generate new identifications (e.g., Dürkheim 1995; Turner 1967; Hunt 1986; 1 Despite their frequent conflation in (non-Canadian) English, "French Canadian" and "Québécois" arc not synonymous. Rather, the terms represent different identifications and visions of the national community, cach historically specific. As early as the 18th century, the descendants of French settlers in Canada called themselves "Canadiens," an ethnonym reflecting their budding identity as distinct from that of their French ancestors. They started calling themselves "Canadiens français" in the early 19th century when the British who settled in Canada after the Conquest (1760) began to describe themselves as "Canadians" (Frenette 1998, p. 9). The term "Canadien français" fell out of usage in Canada in the late 1960s, when the French Canadians in Quebec started thinking of themselves as Québécois. This territorial narrowing of identity set off a ripple effect throughout Canada, causing most French-speaking Canadian groups to redefine their own identities along provincial lines: Franco-Ontarians, Franco-Manitobans, Saskatchewan's Fransaskois, Franco-Albertans, Franco-Columbians and so on. Despite the pervasive use of the term in (non-Canadian) English, thus, there exists no operative "French Canadian" identity sincc that period. Contrary to what is often assumed outside of Canada, moreover, the term "Québécois" does not suggest one's political commitment to Quebec's independence. It is a descriptive rather than a normative political term. In this article, then, I speak of "Canadiens" and "French Canadians" to denote the descendants of French settlers in Canada until the 1960s. I use the term "Québécois" to denote the French Canadian population of Quebec, and "Quebecers" to denote all citizens of Québec regardless of national origins, ethnic background, or linguistic belonging. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="3">Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 425 Ozouf 1988; Sewell 1996), we know much less about the role symbols themselves play in that process. Can symbolic structures produce change? If so, then why and how? These are the questions this article seeks to answer. To do so, we need a theoretical framework and conceptual apparatus that not only consider the process of production of symbolic structures but also leave room for the possibility of those structures to produce change. Tools developed in visual and materiality studies are useful toward that end. Appropriately dubbed the "iconic" or "pictorial turn," the attention to the visual has slowly left the confines of art history, cultural studies, and communications to enter the social sciences. In sociology, it has had the greatest impact in historical and cultural sociology, through the works, for example, of Victoria Bonnell (1997) on the power of visual means of Soviets citizens' political indoctrination, and of Robin Wagner-Pacifici (2005), who has shown the significance of iconographie depictions of rituals of military surrender in legitimating transfers of political authority. To be sure, visual culture and vision are intrinsically sociological phenomena: vision is not simply constituted through the physiology of sight, but rather is a cultural process that is learned and cultivated, and which is constituted through a social relationship between viewer and fellow viewers, as well as between viewer(s) and the subject of viewing. It is that relationship, that social act of looking, that poststructuralist theorists like Lacan and Foucault called le regard, the gaze. While "the gaze" has received the most attention from scholars interested in race and gender, religious studies scholar David Morgan (2005, p. 3) recently has turned to the study of the "sacred gaze," which he defines as "the manner in which a way of seeing invests an image, a viewer or an act of viewing with spiritual significance." What counts as "spiritual" is rather hazy, however, and it is sociologically more productive to restate Morgan's definition of the sacred gaze as the process through which a way of seeing sacralizes an image, a viewer, or an act of viewing. I thus study images and vision as a cultural act potentially imbued with sacredness under certain social conditions. Visual culture is also important for sociologists to consider because it delineates the borders of imagined communities by providing a shared repertoire of images and objects that shape memoiy and identity (Morgan 1999, p. 8). Because images and objects act as concrete substitutes for abstract ideas (Agulhon 1981), they are powerful agents of sociali zation, marketing, and propaganda (Barthes 1957; Bonnell 1997; Cushing and Tompkins 2007; Hall et al. 2006; Sztompka 2012). Deciphering the various components of what French historian Maurice Agulhon (1981) has called "pictorial discourses" set forth by institutions and social actors allows us to analyze the stories people tell about themselves. But precisely because visual symbols, complex pictorial discourses, and material culture can be used as means of socialization or tools of propaganda in the hands of elites—what Chandra Mukeiji (2012) calls "political pedagogy"—they can also become the object of struggles between groups promoting different ideologies, identities or political agendas. That iconomachy in tum sometimes leads to iconoclasm, the discrediting and displacing of rivals through the destruction of their symbols (Morgan 2005). Visual and material culture thus allows us to track conflicts about, and changes in, political visions of the nation (Zubizycki 2011). Analyzing images in relation to their various uses and contests about their meanings and deployments, is also productive because images have a special ability to mediate imaginary, linguistic, intellectual, and material domains (Nora 1997; Mitchell 1986, 1998; Rogoff 1998; Freedberg 1991). As W.J.T. Mitchell (1998) has pointed out, attention to "the visual" pushes us to attend to all the senses, since every "visual object" &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="4">426 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 is in fact perceived through multiple senses. The sight of a painting of Van Gogh's haystacks, for example, cues tactile and olfactory sensations. Studying images, pictorial discourses, and visual culture more broadly is thus necessarily an "intertextual" enter prise, one in which "images, sounds, and spatial delineations are read onto and through one another" (Rogoff 1998, p. 24). The study of visual culture and visuality is therefore closely related to that of materiality, another interdisciplinary field that has expanded rapidly over the last decade, above all in anthropology and technology studies (e.g., Appadurai 1986; Keane 2003, 2006; Woodward 2007; Miller 2005, pp. 1-50; Tilley et al. 2006; Fehervary 2009). Materiality studies is concerned with understanding objects, things, and how people interact with them; it sees the material world not only as an embodiment of values and ideational systems (e.g., Dürkheim 1995,2010) or as congealed social relationships (as a Marxist materialist approach would), but as giving shape and meaning to social relation ships. From this perspective, things even exert a form of agency, as extensions of personhood that impinge on, and call forth responses, from social actors (Gell 1998). Works in materiality studies seek to transcend the dualism between subjects and objects to show how social relations are built through and around the consumption of material culture (rather than merely in its production, as Marx had it). While these concerns have been taken up primarily by scholars in neighboring social sciences, within sociology proper, Mukeiji (1994, 1997,2012), Latour (2007), Alexander (2008,2012), McDonnell (2010) and Zubrzycki (2011) have demonstrated the value of this approach. Chandra Mukerji, for instance, has developed a model of political pedagogy that takes into account the role of material culture in creating and shaping a shared con sciousness and collective identity. She convincingly showed why the gardens of Ver sailles, precisely because they were not discursive but rather "materially exemplaiy," did not generate opposition to the political project they embodied but instead shaped subjects' political allegiances through their experience of that specific material and social environment (2012, p. 511). In a different but related line of inquiry, I have shown (2011) that the visual depiction and embodiment of historical narratives and national myths (in myriad cultural forms, the built environment, and the landscape), which are experienced by individuals in a variety of practices and settings, are what rendered those distant and abstract discourses close and concrete. It is through what I call the "national sensorium" that social actors sensorially experience national narratives and myths and that elite projects generate, below, sentiments of national belonging and genuine emotional attachment to what is necessarily a distant imagined community. Finally, Jeffrey Alexander (2008) recently analyzed the intersection between aesthetics and materiality in his theory of "iconic consciousness," a process by which an aesthetically shaped materiality signifies social value. Following Freud, he defines icons as symbolic condensations that anchor social meanings in a particular material form. Meaning is thus made visible and tangible; it can be seen, felt, touched—in other words, experienced. As the signifier is made into a material thing, the content becomes form.2 Maurice Agulhon was concerned with a similar process, namely that through which imagery (the visual representation, or form, such as Marianne) comes to stand for the image (the concept that the imagery evokes, of the ideological 2 Mabel Berezin, in her study of fascist theater in Italy (1994), has convincingly demonstrated that meaning could be also be found in the mere artistic form regardless of its actual narrative content. â Springer</page><page sequence="5">Thcor Soc (2013)42:423-475 427 content, here the French Republic). What is key, for our purpose, is that these icons are not empty things; rather, they are meaning embodied. While this is partly consistent with Wendy Griswold's definition of "cultural objects," which are "shared significance embodied in form, i.e., ... an expression of meanings that is tangible or can be put into words" (1987, pp. 4-5), here meaning is necessarily material, not merely discursive or aural.3 Meaning is transmitted through sensual contact with the material object—the icon—that imparts its power (Zubrzycki 2011 ; Bartmanski and Alexander 2012). One aspect that remains unexplored by these authors, however, is how the aesthetic and material form of an icon can in turn alter its "inner" content, its meaning. The works of Tia DeNora (2000) and anthropologist Webb Keane (2003, 2006) provide useful leads for us. Inspired by the work of psychologist J.J. Gibsons, DeNora expands the concept of "affordance" to the sociological study of culture. The idea is that material objects have certain properties that can be lent to some uses more easily than others; they "afford" actors the possibility of posing certain actions with the object. The weight, size, and form of an artifact, for example, can "afford" actors to carry it, roll it, break it (or not). In a related but different vein, Keane's theory of "bundling" proposes that an object's very materiality—that is, the specific aspects of its form (its weight, color, the materials of its composition, relative malleability, permeability, mobility, and so on)—endows the object with a life of its own and allows it potentially to acquire different significations from the abstract ones that social actors initially "filled" it with. Material things, he argues, "always combine an indefinite number of physical properties and qualities, whose particular juxtapositions may be mere happenstance. In any given practical or interpretative context, only some of those properties are relevant and come into play. But other properties persist, available for promotion as circumstances change" (2006, p. 200). The emphasis, here, is on the semiotic potential of an object, as its manifold material properties can become socially significant at certain moments. While Dürkheim understands the totem, idol, or icon as sacred and powerful because they embody and materialize collective representations, he neglects the materials that give shape to these abstract collective ideals, as they are "nothing but a block of stone or a piece of wood, things which in themselves have no value."4 I consider both aspects of the icon: the collective representations, ideals, and narratives the icon gives material shape to and its actual material attributes, which afford (or constrain) social actors to pose certain actions, and which may change the icon's very content (meaning) when activated by social actors in certain contexts. My sociological analysis of icons, then, takes into account semiotic and historical, as well as social dimensions of the relation between subject and object. It sees pictorial discourses as not merely descriptive or reflective of national visions deployed by elites 3 Materiality studies scholars would reject that distinction, as a text is printed onto a page, bound into a book that one carries, opens, shelves, or rips or burns; even oral tradition is embodied and material, as it is spoken, sung, or performed by bodies in specific material contexts. 4 Dürkheim writes that "collective ideals can only be manifested and become aware of themselves by being concretely realized in material objects that can be seen by all, understood by all, and represented to all minds." Society therefore projects ideals of its own creation onto an object—a totem, an idol, an icon— thereby becoming conscious of those very ideals made materially explicit (2010, pp. 49-50, emphasis mine). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">428 Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 and consumed by the masses, but as inscriptive, ultimately productive of those very visions. It understands that icons have a life of their own (Mitchell 2005) and a material logic that potentially enables them to shape identities and transform society indepen dently of the meaning initially attributed to them by actors, and independently even from the stated intentions (or lack thereof) of the actors using them (Keane 2003, 2006). Wagner-Pacifici (2010) insists that "it is only by gaining access to the operations and logics of the inner workings of cultural objects that any cultural sociology can begin to track the meanings and resonance of these objects in the social contexts in which they appear," arguing further that "such knowledge of aesthetic objects actually provides insight into the ways that these objects model social reality in their own turn" (2010, p. 109, emphasis mine). Wagner-Pacifici refers primarily to art objects; I extend the argument to symbols and icons deployed in social action, and to that end I develop the concept of aesthetic revolt. By aesthetic revolt I refer to a dual process whereby social actors contest and rework iconic symbols in the public sphere; those symbols acquiring, through those material manipulations, significations that push forward the articulation of new identities and provide momentum for institutional reforms. In what follows, I provide a detailed empirical demonstration of how symbols are not only derivative, but also how and why they themselves participate in the creation of the social, acting as catalysts for what Piotr Sztompka (1993) has called moments of "social becoming." It will not suffice to claim that context, content, form, and performance "all matter." The challenge is precisely to show the specific ways in which they are interrelated and interdependent and to identify the fine chains of significations through which meaning is constituted and disseminated, a chain that once set in motion turns the wheels of change. Situating the case: Québec 's Quiet Revolution (1960-1969) Until the late 1960s, Québec was an archetype of what Charles Taylor calls the "neo Durkheimian" link between national identity and religion, where "the sense of belonging to the group and confession are fused and the moral issues of the group's history tend to be coded in religious categories" (2007, p. 458). Catholicism was historically central in defining French Canadians' national identity against the Anglo Protestants surrounding them on the North American continent. Colonial domination by this Other further reinforced Catholicism's ability to shape an ethno-national identity and strengthened the role played by the Catholic Church in nationalist politics. The national and the religious have therefore been tightly linked at the cultural and institutional levels, with Catholicism serving as a robust ethno-national marker and the Catholic Church effectively acting as a "crypto-state," performing many functions usually carried out by the state, such as education, health, and welfare (Dumont 1986, 1993; Bouchard 1999; Ferretti 1999; Rousseau 2005). The death of Premier Maurice Duplessis in 1959 was the trigger for a wholesale rejection of the status quo. Duplessis had ruled the Province of Québec for almost a quarter of a century, his political tenure characterized by rabid corruption and quid pro quo relationships with the Catholic Church and big business. With the opening of the political structure, a new political elite was elected with the slogans "Things must change," "Now or Never," and "Masters in our own house." Thus began a decade of profound political, social, economic, and cultural transformations that pulled out Québec &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Theor Soc (2013)42:423^75 429 not only from Duplessis' era of so-called Great Darkness (Grande noirceur), but effected a radical rupture with a traditional past.5 Chief among the structural changes taking place was the building of a modem provincial welfare state and the secularization of social services until then controlled by the Church. The institutional marginalization of the Catholic Church was accompanied by an unusually rapid disenchantment of society. Within 10 years, churches once thronged with people several days a week sat empty.6 Some were later bulldozed; others were sold to developers who transformed them into condominiums or hotels; others remained only to be recently rededicated into sites of "cultural heritage" (Baum 1991; Seljak 1996; Lemieux 2006; Christiano 2007; Zubrzycki 2012). As religious practice tumbled, so did fertility: On the eve of the Quiet Revolution, in 1959, Québec had the highest birth rate of all the provinces in Canada, with the statistical French Canadian woman in that province giving birth to, on average, four children. By 1972, Québec had the lowest birth rate in the country, dropping by half to 2.09 children per woman, below the 2.1 standard required for population replacement (Christiano 2007, p. 34).7 If these various trends are not unusual for industri alized societies, the degree and rapidity at which they occurred was spectacular and are at the root of the 1960s' moniker, "Revolution." Needless to say, the Quiet Revolution should not be viewed in isolation from social movements, political developments, and cultural transformations marking the 1960s elsewhere in the world, such as the student rebellions against strict social hierarchies and political authority in the United States and Western Europe; the civil rights movements in the United States; the anti-colonial protests in metropoles and the overthrowing of colonial régimes in Africa and Asia8; the women's liberation move ment and the sexual revolution; and last, but not least, the Second Vatican Council reforms. In Québec, however, these movements were closely related to the rejection of the Church's moral authority and its tight exercise of social control, on the one hand, and with the "national question" on the other. French Canadians in Québec adopted in their nationalist discourse the language of civil rights movements, 5 This historical interpretation of the Quiet Revolution is a key feature of the Québécois national narrative that has a quasi-sacrcd status in Québec (cf., Létourneau 1997). That representation of history, however, is increasingly questioned. Québec historians and sociologists have in recent years engaged a critical re examination of the putative chiaroscuro that contrasts the Duplessis years' "Great Darkness" with the Quiet Revolution's "light" (e.g., Bourque et al. 1994; Gagnon and Sarra-Bournet (1997); Bélanger et al. 2000; Bouchard 2005). Several studies have identified the Quiet Revolution's roots in the 1930s and 1940s, either in liberal activism (Behiels 1985) or even in religious movements within the Catholic Church itself (Meunier and Warren 1999; Gauvreau 2008). 6 In Montréal, for example, participation in Sunday Mass dropped by almost two-thirds, from 88 % in 1957 to 30 % in 1971 (Hamelin 1984, p. 277). For analyses of the role of Catholicism in the constitution of French Canadian society and Catholicism's trajectory in 20th century Québec, see Dumont (1986); Heap et al. (1986); Lemieux (1990); Beauchemin et al. (1991); Baum (1991), Lemieux (2006), Christiano (2007) and Dillon (2007). For an analysis of the reconfiguration of Catholicism as cultural heritage, see Zubrzycki (2012). 7 When many thought it could not get lower, in 1986, the rate hit a record low at 1.4 children per woman, what demographers call "low-low fertility," creating a wave of insecurity about the future of the nation, a nation increasingly described in the media and political discourse as "endangered" {en voie de disparition). 8 An ad paid by Quebec's first separatist political group, the Rassemblement pour l'indépendence nationale, published in Le Devoir on June 30 1961 argued: "In 1951 ... Dahomey (pop. 1,700,000) was a colony, and French Canada was asking for bilingual checks [from the federal government]. In 1961... Dahomey is an independent Republic [of Benin] and French Canada is still asking for bilingual checks. The only solution: INDEPENDENCE." Springer</page><page sequence="8">430 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 Marxism, and post-colonialism: the "White Niggers of North America," to take an expression popularized by an influential manifesto by Pierre Vallières in 1968, were to be emancipated from English Canadian colonial ascendancy9 and freed from the oppression of the Catholic Church by the new government's modern state and its nationalist political project. Feminism was also conceived and articulated within that framework; women's individual emancipation from patriarchal structures would be achieved precisely through Québec 's national emancipation from the Church and from federal control in Ottawa. What was perhaps most surprising about the Quiet Revolution was the rejection of the ethno-religious narrative of the nation and the rapid adoption of a secular identity resting on language and territory (Breton 1988; Mann 1988; Balthazar 1986; Dumont 1993). In that process, French Canadians in Québec re-imagined the symbolic borders of their nation, narrowing them from the large expanse of Canada, in which they were a minority, to the circumscribed territory of Québec, cradle of their civilization, where they constituted the majority (cf. Breton 1988; Lamont and Bail 2005).10 While a body of work has addressed how institutional transformations such as the separation of Church and state affected collective identity in Québec (e.g., Breton 1988; Dumont 1993), the role of symbolic politics and aesthetics in the reshaping of national identity has been neglected. I demonstrate here that a core feature of the Quiet Revolution was an aesthetic revolt, whereby a new generation rejected the symbols of French Canada and its particular aesthetics, redefining national identity in the process. Without giving proper attention to that revolt and to the role played by iconic symbols themselves in that process, the picture of Québec's dramatic secularization and the reconfiguration of national identity during the Quiet Revolution remains incomplete. Methods, data, and sources What I propose is a cultural sociological analysis of historical events to make sense of identity transformation. To do so, I first examine the making of St. John the Baptist (St. Jean-Baptiste) as the national icon of French Canadians, and trace his career through an analysis of pictorial discourses displayed in religious processions and popular parades in nineteenth and twentieth century Québec. By virtue of St. John the Baptist embodying that vision and the celebrations on his name-day pictorially narrating that vision in elaborate allegorical floats and tableaux-vivantsl] moving through public space, the saint became the object of, and the parades celebrating him 9 Québécois nationalism is often citcd as a case of "internal colonialism" nationalism. See, for example, McRobcrts (1979), 10 Whereas Francophones in Quebec constitute approximately 80% of the population, they constitute only 10 to 14% of other Canadian provinces' populations, hence their common designation as "Francophones outside Québec." Québec has therefore also become, in the last four decadcs, the reference through which—and sometimes against which—French-speaking Canadians are defined and define themselves. Acadians constitute an exception to that "rule," as their identity was already distinct from that of French Canadians because of their unique historical experience and the trauma of their massive deportation from Nova Scotia in the late eighteenth century. See Thériault (1994, 1999); and Langlois and Létoumcau (2004). " A tableau-vivant, in this context, is a live sccnographic depiction of a historical event or a scene of everyday life. Tableaux-vivants on floats involved actors and sometimes animals as well. They often comprised built structures (houses, rooms) and "natural" features (trees, gardens, waterfalls) (Figs. 4 and 5). â Springer</page><page sequence="9">Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423^75 431 the platform for, protests through which social actors performed and ultimately /ransformed their national identity in the 1960s. I show that the very material form of the saint and his core attributes were key in fomenting a debate about national identity and religion in the public sphere, and that altering the physical aspect of the icon—its iconoclastic unmaking—was a turning point in the articulation of a new, secular national identity in Québec. By doing so, I demonstrate that national identity is (re)fashioned not only in and through official ideologies and institutional re arrangements, but also through aesthetic revolts. I consider five dimensions of this cultural object's being and life: 1) the historical, political, and social contexts of its creation, interpretation, use, and transformation; 2) its content—that is the ideologies and significations that "fill" it; 3) its visual and material form\ 4) the discourses and contests about it, both concerning its content and form; and 5) how public performances with the object are represented, depicted, and reproduced in the media and interpreted in the public sphere. Correspondingly, I conducted extensive archival research and analyzed a wide and varied corpus of original data on St. John the Baptist and the annual celebrations of June 24th: - Iconographie representations of the patron saint on religious paintings, commem orative coins and medals, prayer cards, advertisements, and cartoons; religio-national artifacts such as sculptures, statues, processional banners and flags; and audio visual documents of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste processions, parades and protests from prints, photographs, documentaries, televised broadcasts and amateur footage. - Official documents from the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal (hereafter SSJBM), the institution in charge of—among many other things—the organiza tion of the holiday's rituals and festivities, including meeting minutes, correspondence, processional protocols, parade themes, float projects, legal briefs, sponsorships, and accounting. - Public debates about the saint and the holiday found in newspapers' editorials and letters to the editor, political speeches, pamphlets and manifestos, political cartoons and graffiti, as well as in religious sermons and pastoral letters. I used photographic and cinematographic records of protests, collecting photographs of banners and placards carried by protesters. These data were collected through original archival research conducted between 2006 and 2009.1 have visited seven archives in Montréal and Québec City and systematically consulted two more available on-line. (A list of Fonds and Collections is provided in Appendix.) I leafed through several dozens of boxes of documents, watched amateur films of parades, documentaries, and film-essays on the parades, as well as purchased television broadcasts of the 1968 and 1969 parades, transcribing the narration myself. In addition to more than a 1,000 pages of photocopied archival documents and more than 700 scanned or photographed images of the saint and parade floats, I personally observed a multitude of artifacts, paintings, stamps, medals, and devotional objects at the Reserve of the Musée de la Civilisation and the Musée de l'Amérique française in Québec City, where I conducted fieldwork in July 2008. Official documents, correspondence, leaflets, and manifestos provide unusually rich and varied data for the analysis of debates surrounding the national icon, the parade, and French Canadian identity. In addition to those, I also analyzed coverage â Springer</page><page sequence="10">432 Theor Soc (2013)42:423-475 of, and debates about, the annual parade and its namesake in newspapers representing diverse ideological positions and political options, as well addressing different subsets of Québec's population. Most of those consulted were dailies (L'Action catholique, Le Devoir, Le Journal de Montréal, La Patrie, Le Petit Journal, La Presse, The Gazette, The Montreal Star) and my sample included all issues published during the 2 weeks preceding and following the annual celebration of Saint Jean-Baptiste Day, when the debates about the event were most likely to occur and controversies to be covered, from the beginning of the Quiet Revolution until the first referendum on Québec's independence (1959-1981). I systematically reviewed those newspapers on microfilm at the library of Laval University in Québec City in 2008, scrolling through every page of each issue, downloading, printing or photographing relevant articles, and noting the prominence of the story on the page, paying attention to photographs accompanying it and other stories or advertisements next to it, providing "extra-textual" evidence that search engines and software do not. Of the eight newspapers 1 consulted, two catered to the Anglophone population of Montréal and were therefore in English. While debates were typically not occurring in the pages of those publications (because they concerned French Canadianness and were not involv ing Anglo-Canadian Montrealers), as parades became the site of contestation and occasion for violent protests, The Gazette and the Montreal Star started covering them more attentively. Editors sometimes used the Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrations as an occasion to explain to English-speaking Montrealers the cultural politics of the Quiet Revolution. As such, I found them to be relevant sources. Together, these different kinds of data from multiple sources also allowed me to track carefully, through time, the transformation of the icon and the dialogical relations among discourse, aesthetics, and performance. In the next sections, I first discuss the construction of Catholic French Canadian identity in the mid-nineteenth century and its narrative elaboration around the figure of St. John the Baptist. I then analyze the narrative's iconic embodiment in the saint by looking at his representation in popular iconography, and examine the narrative's pictorial materialization and performance in nineteenth-century processions and twentieth-century parades. As the saint embodied a religious vision of national identity, I show that it served as the material locus for debates about national identity and its relationship to Catholicism during the Quiet Revolution. The parades provided the stage for political contenders to protest against that religious vision to articulate tentatively a new secular national project, and finally to push it forward forcefully. I demonstrate how specific symbolic configurations and material properties of the icon invited its transformation and led to its ultimate demise, acting as a catalyst for the crystallization of a new national identity. Finally, I discuss what this approach contrib utes to the study of nationalism and to cultural, political, and historical sociology more broadly. The narrative and iconic construction of French Canadianness The Catholic discourse of the French Canadian nation emerged the uncontested victor only after the failure of the Patriots' Rebellions in 1837-1838, a series of republican insurrections against British colonial power organized by peasants and &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="11">Thcor Soc (2013)42:423^75 433 Liberal laymen.12 With bounties on their heads, the surviving Rebellion leaders went into hiding or escaped to the United States, leaving a void of elites able to carry the liberal torch. The defeat of the heretofore governing liberal bourgeoisie resulted in an ideological vacuum that the clergy, aided by British authorities, energetically filled as the Catholic hierarchy in Lower Canada had vehemently condemned the Patriots' liberalism and revolutionary impulses. A marriage of convenience between the British colonial author ities and the Church hierarchy was established, as one could not successfully exercise its functions without the other: The Catholic Church would not easily pursue its mission in British North America without the consent of the British, and the British could not rule effectively without the loyalty of its conquered subjects and the help of the clergy, their only elites. It is against that backdrop that education, health, and welfare were slowly but solidly confessionalized, turning the Church in French Canada into a "crypto-state" until the creation of the provincial welfare state in the 1960s (Ferretti 1999). The most obvious and direct consequences of the Rebellions' defeat were that the colony remained within the Empire and the republican project faded from the political agenda. It also led to an increase in the institutional power and ideological influence of the Catholic Church in Québec, the institution now best able to create, sustain, and disseminate a national project. Unlike the Patriots' Rebellions, that project was devoid of overtly political content, defined instead in ethno-religious terms centered on the idea of survivance, or cultural survival.13 The repression of the Patriots' Rebellions therefore stifled an emergent civic definition of the Canadian nation and led to the development of an ethno-religious vision of the French Canadian nation instead. To carry that vision, the Church built a retrospective messianic narrative of the French Canadians' historical destiny in North America that gradually elevated St. John the Baptist as its figurehead. According to the Christian Bible, John the Baptist was Jesus's cousin, born roughly six months before him to Mary's barren cousin, Elizabeth. John's special bond with Jesus was evident even pre-natally, as he is said in Luke 1:39-56 to have "leapt for joy" in his mother's womb upon hearing Mary's greeting. His miraculous conception foretold that of Jesus, whom John baptized in the Jordan River, and his lifestyle mimicked that of the Jewish Bible's prophets. According to Matthew 3:4, he wore clothing made of camel's hair and "ate locusts and wild honey." Yet his mission was to herald the New Era and announce the coming of the Messiah. As told in John 1:23, the saint, called the Precursor in the Catholic tradition, proclaimed "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord.'" He is also said to have declared "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" which is why the saint is often 12 Although most of the Patriots and their leaders were French-speakers, the movement was not constituted on linguistic, cultural, or ethnic bases. There were prominent Englishmen among the Rebellion's leaders and the arguments for secession were political; they were inspired by the ideals of the American and French Revolutions, to which the Patriots frequently referred in speeches, pamphlets, and ceremonial toasts at meetings and banquets.

If the saint's decollation is the most vivid image of his life, devotional iconography distinctively depicts him with right arm lifted, index finger pointed at the heavens, in the declarative gesture announcing the coming of Christ. This was an image often reproduced in French Canadian popular depictions (Fig. 1). In the Catholic calendar, John the Baptist's feast day is June 24th, coinciding with the summer solstice, long celebrated by pagans throughout the world as the feast of light. The syncretic fusion of summer solstice with a saint announcing the New Era, and light amidst darkness, has proven resilient and compelling. From Europe to Latin America, many Christian societies celebrate St. John the Baptist's Day with bonfires and fireworks, and the feast is especially popular in agrarian societies and rural communities where summer solstice marks the onset of the season of labor, providing the last occasion for collective celebration until harvest (Vloberg 1942; Vaultier 1946; Van Gennep 1949; Guss 2000; Provencher 1982, pp. 194-198; Desdouits 1987). In French Canada, the Church equated St. John the Baptist's mission with that of the French in the New World. As the Precursor heralded the coming of Christ and baptized him, embarking him on his charge to redeem a corrupted world, in the Church's narrative the French had discovered Canada and brought civilization and Christianity to the pagan Natives they evangelized, creating a providential country in a New World. Like the Precursor, they prepared the way, clearing dense forests to open bucolic fields where the new truth would be planted and thrive. Like the saint, the French Canadian people claimed a privileged relationship with Christ; they were a chosen people (Smith 2003). The original, French-language version of the national anthem O Canada, initially composed as a religio-patriotic hymn for the 1880 North American "Congrès national des Canadiens-Français" on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day (Chouinard 1881), provides a powerful example of that discourse: Ô Canada! Land of our forefathers Thy brow is wreathed with a glorious garland of flowers As in thy arm ready to wield the sword So also is it ready to carry the cross Thy history is an epic of the most brilliant exploits Thy valor steeped in faith Will protect our homes and our rights Under the gaze of God, next to the giant river The Canadien grows up hopeful He is bom of a proud race15 14 The Christian use of the symbol of the lamb originates from the Hebrew tradition. To protect Jews from the 10th plague brought by God to the Egyptians, God told Moses to instruct them to sacrifice lambs and mark their doors with the animals' blood so that the Angel of Death would "pass over" their house and save their firstborn sons from execution. Jesus celebrated his own "Last Supper" with his disciples on Passover and with his proposal of a new covenant positioned himself as the sacrifice, agnus Dei, the saving lamb of God. In the French Canadian narrative, the lamb further signified civilization through the progress of the Christian missions. 15 In the 19th century, the term "race" in French denotes what we today would call ethno-nationality. ■Ö Springer</page><page sequence="13">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 435 Fig. 1 Following biblical descriptions, St. John the Baptist is typically represented with curly hair, dressed in pelts and holding a reed cross in one hand, pointing his index finger toward the heavens, a gesture announcing the coming of the Messiah. A lamb is also often at his side. Religious iconography depicts him in several stages of his life, but often as a child. In French Canada, it is that pre-pubescent representation of the saint that dominated.

The lyrics are by Judge Adolphe-Basile Routhier and the music by Calixa Lavallée, a popular composer of the period. The religio-patriotic hymn was proclaimed Canada's national anthem on July 1, 1980,100 years after its creation. Until then Canada did not have a "national" anthem per se; "God Save the Queen" was its official anthem. There have been some 20 English versions of "0 Canada" since its popularization in English Canada in the 20th century. The version on which the contemporary official English lyrics arc based was written in 1908 by Mr. Justice Robert Stanley Weir on the occasion of Quebec City's 300th anniversary and was only slightly altered in 1968 by a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons: O Canada! Our home and native land!/True patriot love in all thy sons command/With glowing hearts we see thee rise/The True North, strong and free!/From far and wide, O Canada/We stand on guard for thee/God keep our land glorious and free! The original French lyrics (translated into English in the text above) remain unaltered. French and English-speaking Canadians therefore learn and sing very different national anthems. After the Quiet Revolution and the creation of a secular Québécois national identity, "O Canada" lost its resonance for many francophone Québécois. It is rejected by many who associate it with another nation, Canada, but also because it narrates the history and destiny of a now defunct national vision, that of French Canadians. It also underlined the collaboration between the Crown and the Church, two powers that were perceived as colonizing the people. Booing "O Canada" thus became a common form of protest in the 1960s and in the mid-1970s, with the rise of separatism. For earlier English versions of "O Canada" and a history of the anthem, see http:// www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/anthem_e.cfm#h2 (accessed July 18, 2007). It is worthy of note that two other key symbols of the Canadiens—the maple leaf and the beaver—were abandoned following their adoption by English Canadians. They were replaced by the fleur de lys, which highlighted the cultural connection to, and continuity with, France, thereby retreating from an initial "Creole" national identity that had emphasized difference from the mother country (See Bizicr and Paulette 1997, and Zubrzycki, "'Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue': The Cultural Politics of National Symbols in Québec and Canada." Article in progress.) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 437 guided by its faith, whose divine mission is accomplished by the sword and the cross. The hymn also emphatically recognizes the [English] secular power and rejoices in the political status quo: the Canadiens are "enem[ies] of tyranny but fall of loyalty," who share a "sacred love for the throne and the altar" and "repeat like [their] fathers the cry of victory 'for Christ and for King.'" As the new colonial regime shielded the Church from the dangerous French Revolution, and the Rebellions' repression by the British authorities assured the Church's institutional and ideological dominance in Québec, it worked diligently at fostering the Canadiens' loyalty to the Crown, a strategy that will be fiercely criticized during the Quiet Revolution. The French Canadian people, in this powerful ethno-Catholic narrative, were an "apostolic people," chosen and entrusted with a providential mission supported by the "twin pillars of faith and language," according to Jules-Paul Tardivel, a leading religious nationalist ([1881] in Jewsiewicki 1995, p. 233).17 Those twin pillars were parallel supports of the national mission. The French language carried Catholicism, and Catholicism distinguished and ultimately protected French Canadians from "foreign races" on the continent. Catholicism guarded against linguistic assimilation because of the proscription against marrying outside the faith.18 Religion, language, and ethnicity became increasingly fased, one reinforcing the other, resulting in the creation of a cohesive national identity articulated in a coherent messianic narrative, and represented in the powerful figure of St. John the Baptist (Fig. 2). Still, if the Conquest had sheltered the Church from the devastating effects of the French Revolution, it had nevertheless brought with it heresy. The French Canadian mission was therefore also articulated in opposition to Anglo-Saxon Protestantism and its corrosive values, materialism and individualism. In the words of the influential Mgr. Louis-Adolphe Pâquet (1915): Let it be known that we are not merely a civilized race, we are pioneers of civilization; we are not merely a religious people, we are messengers of the religious idea; we are not merely the submissive sons of the Church, we are among its zealots, its defenders, its apostles. Our mission is not to manipulate capital, but rather to assemble ideas; it consists not in lighting the fires of industries but in feeding and radiating the luminous fire of religion and thought. (My emphases.) In that famous sermon, Mgr. Pâquet emphasizes the higher purpose of the French Canadians compared to the sooty industrial ambitions of Anglo-Protestants. A pop ular nineteenth-century proverb succinctly captured that rivalry and the claim to Catholicism's superiority: "Church steeples will always be higher than factory chim neys. ..." The French Canadians' mission, however, was not to be sown only through ideas. It was also, if not primarily, yoked to the image of arduous yet noble agricultural labor. Canadiens, like their patron saint, were to remain close to nature, renouncing the luxuries of city life for a simple but enlightened life on the land. Indeed, according to an influential pamphlet popular at the turn of the century "the instruments of French-Canadian destiny" were "the cross, the sword, and the 17 All translations in the text are my own, unless otherwise noted. 18 The enforcement of that religious rule actually promoted the assimilation of some non-French-speaking Catholics to the French Canadian community, most notably the Irish who, despite speaking English, often assimilated with the French-Canadians in Québec.

The normative vision that located heavenly virtue in the simple tilling of the soil meant, practically, that the development of the industrial and economic spheres was left to Anglo-Protestants and Jews.20 Thus by the 1960s, new nationalists denounced the Church as the past cause and present hindrance to the period of "catching up" (rattrapage) and modernization that was so urgently needed. Processions and parades as pictorial performances From the mid-nineteenth century on, Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrations provided occasions for religio-patriotic sermons, political speeches, nationalist manifestos, and popular assem blies where a distinct vision of French Canadianness was promoted and celebrated. The days surrounding June 24th provided a space for heightened and condensed national(ist) activity, and were moments of an accelerated sense of "national time."21 Parades became the cornerstone of the celebrations and present especially rich sources for several reasons: First, because of their liminal character: neither singular nor quotidian occurrences, these cyclical rites are at once ordinary and extraordinary, traditional and innovative, highly scripted and liable to improvisation. As Susan Davis noted, parades are both familiar and spectacular, and this dualism made them an especially significant mode of communication in nineteenth-century American cities (1986, p. 3). Second, because of their aesthetic expressiveness and collective performance in public space, parades often evoke an emotional power that the simple literary formula tion of ideas or values typically lack (Cf. Dürkheim 1995; Ryan 1989; Zubrzycki 2011). Third, parades typically constitute an organized body taking up public space to "spell out a common identity" (Ryan 1989, p. 133). They served as important vectors and builders of collective identity in mid-twentieth century Yankee City (Warner 1959), just as gay pride parades in the 1970s institutionalized the collective memory of the 1969 Stonewall riots and gave a public face to multiple groups that until then had lived "underground" (Armstrong and Crage 2006). This performative cohesion does not mean, of course, that there "is" a single common identity, but it does suggest a certain amount of consensus over what an ideal identity or way of life "should be." As public performances, parades tend to be highly orchestrated, involving a large number of participants (sponsors, organizers, creators, choreographers, coordinators, actors, and marchers)—as well as a mass-audience watching in the streets or listening at home to radio or television broadcasts that overlay the visual images and soundscape with spoken commentaries that instruct the audience as to the narratives presented, and the proper emotional responses to them. As such, historian Mary Ryan claims, they "can tell us something of the historical process whereby cultural meaning is created" (ibid. p. 133). Yet, as I show later in the article, while a certain level of consensus is required to produce a parade, the very performance of what "should be" is precisely what makes 19 From a speech delivered by Charles Thibault, a lawyer, at the 1884 Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrations. The allocution became canonical, emblematic of clerical nationalism, and widely disseminated in pamphlet form, extracts of which were included in school textbooks throughout the first half of the 20th century. On ultra-montanism and clerical nationalism in Québec, see Eid (1978). 20 See the classic ethnographies of Miner (1939) Hughes (1943), which discuss the relationship between culture and economic life in French Canada. 21 See, for example, the following primary sources: Chouinard (1881, 1890), Lemay (1898), Dugré (1923), Morin (1924), Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste (1926), Suite (1929), Asselin (1937), and analyses of the Saint Jean-Baptiste celebrations and the SSJBM: Blain (1964), Mathieu (1969), Boisvert (1990), Guay (1973), Giguère (1975), Rumilly (1975), Reid (1980), Turcotte (1987). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">440 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 parades the perfect platform for articulating protest about that normative project. Those political contests between different visions of what "should be" are the fourth reason why parades are important sociological phenomena. Davis (1986), Ryan (1989), Glassberg (1990), and Newman (1999) all showed that by taking part in parades and street festivals, ordinary men and women played a significant role in forging the political culture of the United States.22 Parades (and protests), because they occur in the public sphere and physically occupy public place, serve as a space in which contests over legitimacy are played out. Geertz (1985) demonstrated that processions and parades, as displays of power, served to produce charisma and legitimate authority, while Hunt (1988) and Davis showed that the opposite was also true, namely that such ritual events, when even slightly distorted, could be disruptive of political authority, that "they could be political actions and rhetorical means by which performers attempted to accomplish practical and symbolic goals" (1986, p. 5).23 Parades are therefore unquestionably important sociological phenomena. They are significant in my analysis of aesthetic revolt because they were both the sites of the performance and subversion of an established national narrative embodied in the saint, providing the stage for the spec tacular articulation of new national identity in the 1960s. Before I analyze the Saint-Jean-Baptiste parades and the contests about them, I must first offer a few descriptors: French settlers had celebrated Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day on June the 24th from the beginning of the colony, as did their ancestors in France. In the mid-nineteenth century, in the context of clerical nationalism, small bonfires blessed by village priests were replaced by elaborate processions in the streets of Montréal and Québec City on the saint's nameday (Fig. 3). They were modeled on the impressive processions of Corpus Christi, which is a moveable feast celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. On years when Corpus Christi fell sufficiently close to June 24th, street decorations and gigantic floral arches of triumph would remain in place to serve for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste procession. These religious processions slowly developed into expansive parades combining religious and secular imagery (Guay 1973). By the twentieth century these parades became wildly popular and were organized throughout Québec, Ontario, Manitoba, and wherever French Canadians settled in suffi cient numbers to create and sustain French Canadian associations ("Sociétés Saint-Jean Baptiste"). They were popular throughout the American East Coast, where large French Canadian communities were established in the nineteenth century to work in mines and factories (e.g., Lowell, Mass.; Lewiston, Maine), and throughout the American Midwest (Michigan, Illinois, Missouri) (Frenette 1998). Unlike American parades, which are close to marches structured around a succession of social groups and organizations,24 the 22 The literature on parades is especially rieh on the Irish case because of the continued relevance of parades in the affirmation ofnational identity in Northern Ireland and the violent conflicts those events both commemorate and often create (cf., Kenncy 1991; Jarman 1997; Bryan 2000; Kirkland 2002; Ross 2007; Smithey 2011). 23 Abner Cohen (1993) calls this form of politics articulated in non-political cultural forms "masquerade politics." Carnivals and parades fall under that category. Although I agree with Cohen that this cultural form is utterly political, I am uncomfortable with the term he chose to name such practices, as masquerade implies playfulness and carnival via its association with disguise and costumes, but also deception, as something masquerades or attempts to pass as something else. 34 Susan Davis (1986) describes the 1832 parade as a "colorful spectacle presenting] a ceremonious image of the city's social makeup," divided into distinct divisions: "city leaders," "military," "masters and employees of several trades," etc. She sees parades as an important, varied and popular mode of communication in 19th c. American cities. â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423^75 441 SXffi* OF nil! IKOCESS»* IB ST-J MS UTÎBH OA*. WOVIKMI SCENES OF Til!; PROCESSION ON $T| :AN RWTISTE Mi.

The Montréal parades had yearly themes that structured the pictorial discourse that was narrated on a series of impressive floats: some were historical (e.g., "Four Centuries of History" [1927], "Birth of a French and Catholic City in the 18th century" [1942]); others were ethnographic (e.g., "Homage to the French Canadian Peasant Family" [1941], "Homage to the French Canadian Woman" [1961]); while others celebrated French culture and French Canadian folklore (e.g., "Folktales and Legends of French Canada" [1929], "Her Majesty the French Language" [1957]); or showcased the landscape and key geographic features of French Canada (e.g., "The Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes [1935], "The Saint-Lawrence Seaway" [1959]). Although religion was a running leitmotif through all parades, the yearly theme was also explicitly religious on a few occasions (e.g., "Radiant Faithfulness" [1954]).25 As an 25 From 1924 to 1966, the annual parades had themes related to French Canada: "French Canada Remains Faithful" (1939); "The Face of French Canada" (1956); or "The French Canadian Presence in the World" (1966). (Three parades also had themes highlighting the North American reach of the French Canadian mission: "What [North] America owes to the French Race" (1924); "[North] America's French Groups" (1945); "The French Expansion in [North] America" (1949).) Before they were abolished in 1970, the last three parades explicitly and self-consciously shifted the reference to Québec: "Québec's international vocation" (1967); "Québec '68" (1968); "Québec, My Love" (1969) (Fonds P81, Archives nationales du Québec à Montréal). This change in reference presents another index of the identity transformation that took place during the Quiet Revolution and of the role of the parades in that ideological and semantic shift. â Springer</page><page sequence="20">442 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 important public ritual forcefully linking religion with collective identity and history, the annual parades created a sacred community of destiny (Wuthnow 1994; Taylor 2007). Father Alexandre Dugré, a prominent Jesuit priest in the 1920s, argued that "A people, like a child, learns through its eyes; [it should be clear] that the illustration is superior to the printed word; that the poster is superior to the book, which often remains unread; and the tableau-vivant and the heroic parade are far superior to the history library...."26 Saint-Jean-Baptiste parades indeed became the visual and material carrier of the national narrative, as they presented tangible, vivid, dynam ic displays of what "French Canadianness" was or should be about (e.g., Fig. 4). They were, to borrow Mukeiji's apt formulation, "a social technology of experi ential learning" (2012, p. 530). Aesthetics were used as heuristics, as a pedagog ical tool. While the themes varied and the floats themselves were reinvented every year, the single constant component, year after the year, was the parade's last float, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The patron saint of French Canadians was typically repre sented as a golden child in the company of a lamb on religious paintings, common prayer cards, medals, sculptures, and nationalist memorabilia, emulating popular Italian paintings of the Holy Family where Jesus and John play together.27 Inspired by these widespread depictions, the parades' last float was adorned by a carefully chosen curly-haired boy holding his beloved lamb. For over a century, this was the unrivaled anthropomorphic representation of the nation28 (Figs. 5 and 6), an iconic representation that would be at the center of debates during the 1960s' Quiet Revolution, creating turmoil and inspiring violence in the public sphere.29 Discursive and material reworkings of national icons From the very beginning of the 1960s, when the Quiet Revolution was not yet quite revolutionary, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Holiday provided a venue to voice critiques of the ethno-Catholic vision of the nation, its symbols, and its forms of expression. It 26 The original quote opens with "Le peuple" which can mean both the nation and the masses/populace (i.e., "a" people and "the" people.) Dugré is playing on both significations here, as he is advocating national indoctrination, but arguing more specifically for the visual form this indoctrination should take given the "child-like" nature of the mostly illiterate populace [quoted from Fernand Dansereau's 1973 essayistic documentary, La Parade]. 27 Slightly like today's greeting cards, prayer cards were offered to mark various occasions: first commu nions, graduations, weddings, one's entry into the orders, retirement, and such significant life events. They were often offered as "get well" wishes, with specific saints addressing different ills or problems. Prayer cards were also obtained by individuals for their personal devotion to their namesake's saint or as invocations to specific help, or as religious souvenirs from pilgrimage sites. They were small enough to be carried in one's missal, wallet, or purse, and were sometimes signed by the person who offered them. As such, these devotional objects were important in daily life. On the import of visual and material culture in Christianity see Miles (1985) and McDannell (1995). 28 On the personification of ideologies, see Maurice Agulhon's study of Marianne, the iconic representation of the French Republic (1981). Agulhon demonstrates what Father Dugré maintained, namely the power of pictorial discourses to substitute for abstract ones. 29 The first time the saint was represented as a child was in the 1851 procession (Guay 1973); the last time was in the 1963 parade. ö Springer</page><page sequence="21">Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 443 ÜIm Fig. 4 While the most important parades were in Montréal and Québec City, many smaller localities and villages staged their own parade in the province and French Canadian communities throughout Canada and the United States.

The Holiday provided a stage where two primary sets of national actors debated: the Church's hierarchy and a new wave of secular nationalists.30 On June 24, 1961, for example, Cardinal Léger, Archbishop of Montréal, declared in his sermon during the traditional Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day Holy Mass that "the French 3 One must distinguish here between 1) "mainstream" political actors, involved in the formation of the welfare state and the definition of a new national project during the Quiet Revolution—Jean Lesage's Liberal Party and his bright star, René Lévesque, future prime minister of Québec; 2) other significant groups such as Pierre Bourgault's Rassemblement pour l'indépendence nationale (RIN) (1960-68), who were neither directly involved in state affairs nor in the official opposition, but were influential outside regular political channels by shaping the debates in the public sphere and organizing protests and strikes; and 3) even more marginal groups like the Marxist Front de la libération populaire (FLP) and the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), which rocked the 1960s and early 1970s with violent protests, iconoclastic actions, and even terror. These last two groups should not be confused. The FLQ was created in 1963 from the radical elements of the RIN, who advocated—and resorted to—violence as a means to promote Québec's sovereignty. It disintegrated with the arrest of several members following the so-called October Crisis, in 1970, when the group's kidnapping of Québec's Vice-Premier and a British diplomat led to the death of the former and the institution of the War Measures Act in Québec. The FLP was constituted by the remaining left wing of the RIN, from which it split in 1968. The remainder of members of the RIN joined René Lévesque's newly created Parti Québécois a year later, in 1969. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 5 St-Jean Baptiste with his lamb (tied to a rope) on a parade float.

This opposition gained ground, in the 1960s, through attacks on Saint John the Baptist and his diminutive lamb. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="24">446 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 Protesting the icon's content and form The representation of the nation as a pre-pubescent saint was offensive to a new wave of nationalists on two principal grounds: they rejected the religious narrative of the nation, expressed in and fomented by the symbol, as retrograde; and they found the specific depiction of the nation as a child infantilizing because it underlined the nation's dependence. The lamb was also viewed as problematic. If a theological interpretation highlights the salvational nature of the lamb (see note 14), critics emphasized a secular and more insidious interpretation of the tableau. In their view, if John the Baptist was the nation's patron and protector, the lamb was the nation itself, exploited and ultimately sacrificed. In a strategic semantic shift, the new critics began to speak of the sheep instead of the lamb to push to the foreground a troubling set of associations: one of a docile and dumb nation, a nation that lets wolves "eat the wool off its back," and tamely follows directions when its own interests lay elsewhere. Note that it is the physical properties of the symbol that made possible the shift of signification from lamb to sheep (and from a nation bearing a divine mission to a dumb and passive one). As discussed earlier, by virtue of what he calls "bundling," Webb Keane notes that material things "always combine an indefinite number of physical properties and qualities, whose particular juxtapositions may be mere hap penstance. In any given practical or interpretative context, only some of those properties are relevant and come into play. But other properties persist, available for promotion as circumstances change" (2006, p. 200). The wool of the lamb, a physical property that, though present and obvious went unnoticed in the interpreta tion of the symbol prior to the 1960s, suddenly became relevant in the context of the Quiet Revolution's emphasis on economic development and autonomy. It is the wool that made possible the discursive transformation of the lamb into a sheep. In this specific context, it underlined the problematic economic situation of French Cana dians, cast as one of passive acceptance of its exploitation by hungry wolves. Keane further explains that because "things always contain properties in excess of those which have been interpreted and made use of under any given circumstance, [they] retain an unpredictable range of latent possibilities. [As such], [t]hey do not only express past acts, intentions and interpretations. They also invite unexpected re sponses" (ibid., p. 201). This "invitation" can make change possible. "The sheep" therefore became the symbolic foil against which a new political elite defined their national project, articulated around the idea of progress, economic development, and political self-reliance. Lévesque's use of the sheep as a negative metaphor for the nation in 1961 was not accidental. A day before Lévesque's speech, Québec's first separatist political party, the Rassemblement pour l'Indépendence Nationale (RIN), criticized the lamb and jokingly suggested that Québec's animal emblem should be a lion (The Gazette, June 24 1961). A few months later the RIN, which until then had no official logo, chose a ram's head with gigantic horns to represent itself, in explicit contrast to the docile lamb/emasculated sheep. A founding member explained in his memoir that "The ram is in opposition to, by evoking it, the traditional Saint-Jean-Baptiste sheep, an unflattering representation of French Cana da. In the Zodiac, Aries is a sign of spring. It is a symbol of strength and renewal [...] (D'Allemagne 1974, p. 62).

In 1962, in a visual commentary on an on-going strike, the daily Montréal newspaper La Presse published on its first page a cartoon depicting a herd of sheep jumping through a hoop and off a cliff, with the caption: "Happy Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day Anyway!" (June 23, 1962). The parade, the following day, was delayed when the lamb was kidnapped by "separatist militants." Marcel Chaput, RIN president, qual ified as "shameful" a parade whose star attraction was "a young Saint Jean-Baptiste of indefinite gender, accompanied by his damn sheep" (La Presse June 28, 1962). Note the discursive profanation, in which Chaput not only questions the gender of the saint, but turns the holy lamb—the agnus Dei, announcing the salvational Divinity of Christ—into a "damn(ed) sheep."32 According to him, the Société Saint-Jean Baptiste was "perpetuating a state of inferiority it claim[ed] to be combating" by representing the nation in that specific form (ibid.). A year later, in response to the controversy around the lamb and breaking with a long-standing tradition, the animal was omitted from the traditional tableau-vivant, never to return. The SSJBM Board announced in its April 1963 newsletter that "This year there [will] be no little lamb—either white or black—in the parade because of its growing unpopularity. 'New times, new ways,' the wiser ones will say" (Le Bulletin national April 1963, p. 5). Note here the playful recognition that the white lamb had become a black sheep.33 Although it was perceived by the SSJBM and the Catholic Church as a necessary but harmless compromise that might appease critics, and although it was understood by those critics as a meaningless "symbolic gesture," the removal of the lamb from the tableau "saint with lamb" was anything but inconsequential. That removal, I show below, was a turning point that set off a series of symbolic transformations leading to the beheading of Saint Jean-Baptiste in 1969, thus participating in the demise of French Canadianness and the articulation of a new Québécois identity. It was surely easier to remove the lamb from the tableau than to remove the saint himself from the parade in his honor. Yet the child-saint too had often been the target of verbal attacks, as the above quote from Chaput illustrates. In previous years, that specific representation of the patron saint had been criticized often and credibly 31 The RIN also organized protests against institutions perceived as having colonial agendas during which protesters bleated loudly, a symbolic performance criticizing both the colonial regime and French Cana dians supporting it. 32 Because the saint was portrayed in its child-like form, great emphasis was placed on his curls. A boy's hair was a key criterion to be selected to represent the saint in the Montréal parade. In smaller communities, when a boy fitting that criterion could not be found, a girl often impersonated the saint. The representation of the saint as a child thus not only underlined the infantility of the nation, but also emasculated it for the child's long locks made the saint's gender unclear and his young age pointed to a still unformed sexual identity that did not project strength and purpose. These aspects were also partly at the source of the opposition against that particular representation of the patron saint, as evidenced by the RIN's choice of a ram for its logo or by the Catholic Church's "virilization" of the saint in sermons and new iconic depictions in the mid-1960s. 33 This was not the first time the specific configuration child/lamb was criticized and debated. Olivar Asselin, president of the SSJBM in 1913-1914, himself qualified this representation as "a sad and clownish spectacle" (1937 [1913], pp. 86-92). This critique, however, was articulated in the context of reigning clerical nationalism and as such did not—and could not—have the resonance and impact similar critiques had during the Quiet Revolution's overall cultural and political transformations. Springer</page><page sequence="26">448 Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 enough for the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste to feel driven to justify it and "remarket" it publicly, as in this press release published in several newspapers: Why a Child in the June 24th Parade? Every year, some find our choice to represent our Patron as a child in the historic parade scandalous. One should take into account that among the 800,000 people who line Sherbrooke Street every year, there are some 400,000 children under the age of ten. The Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste sees no reason to deprive them of this graceful and poetic tableau, much closer to their heart than the other historic and necessarily more austere floats. All the educational experts agree with us on this point. Let us leave to the small children, on this national Holiday—which is also theirs—this naïve represen tation. Besides, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day is the "Christmas of Summer" and on this day the Baptist has an irresistible appeal, like the Baby Jesus in the Christmas crèche (...) {L'Information nationale, June-July 1962, p.4, released and reprinted in Le Devoir, June 23, 1962, p. 20). In that statement, the SSJBM evokes the importance of visual and ludic sociali zation of children to justify that specific representation of the saint, while attempting to affirm his sacredness by associating him with his cousin Jesus. In response to the continuing critiques such remarketing failed to assuage, that year (1962) the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal tried a new approach by presenting two Saint Jean-Baptistes: one opening the parade as "the official homage to the Patron of the French Canadians," personified by a majestic adult bronze statue of the saint; the other closing the parade and commemorating the "nativity" of the saint on a float called "Summer Christmas," with the saint dramatized by an actual little boy (Le Bulletin national, May 1962, p. 7) (Fig. 7). Two things are worth noting: first, by opening the parade with an adult statue and closing it with the child-saint, this strategy to address growing critiques of the national icon created a "regressive" pictorial narrative. One would expect the opposite order (the one chosen by newspapers, as seen on Fig. 7): the parade opening with the child and closing with the adult statue, visually representing the saint's qua nation's coming of age instead of his/its regressing from adulthood to childhood. This suggests that for the SSJBM, tradition (closing the parade with the child-saint personifed by a young boy) prevailed over narrative considerations and their potential interpretations by spectators. Second, by introducing a new, dual representation of the saint, the SSJBM actually opened the door to further transformations. Even though the following year, in 1963, the parade retreated to presenting only one saint—in its traditional child-like form but without his lamb and "surrounded by an honor guard waving the torch of a reinvigorated nationalism" {La Presse June 25, 1963)—in 1964 the live "Petit Saint Jean-Baptiste" was being perma nently replaced by a grown-up statue of the Baptist.34 An editorial in Montreal's main 34 The transformation from child to adult in the annual parades was sudden and quite dramatic, but the transition in the representation of the saint was often more gradual in other visual venues, such as magazines, where he was sometimes portrayed as an adolescent, respecting the usual physiological and emotional stages of maturing. â Springer</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 7 In 1962, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal decided to include two saints in its annual parade: the traditional "petit St. Jean-Baptiste" closed the parade as he always had, but a majestic bronze statue of an adult saint opened it. The two are juxtaposed on the first page of the weekly La Patrie on June 24, 1962. From the personal archives of Denys Deläge English-language daily, The Gazette, clarified the transformation to its Anglo-Canadian readership, lost in debates on-going in the French-Canadian communities: Never before in the history of French Canada has the celebration of Saint-Jean Baptiste Day been so elaborate and so popular. Indeed, the celebrations have Springer</page><page sequence="28">450 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423^175 this year been extended to include a week-long series of notable events, of which the parade to be held tonight is the highlight. Gone is the golden-hair little boy, with the small lamb clutched at his side. This symbolizes an overall change of character and meaning. The day of the arcadian and rustic ceremony is finished. In today's parade, Saint-Jean-Baptiste will appear as an 11 ft high statue, modern in every respect, a symbol, as sculptor Gaétan Themen says, of that which is "strong, powerful, dynamic." This change in the character of the ceremony is an authentic reflection of the changes that recent years have brought to French Canada. Just as French Canada has put aside the arcadian theme in its national celebrations, they have been striving to put aside the arcadian theme in their national character. The change of image marks a change of substance, a change in the reality of things. The vigor of French Canada today is the vigor of a society seeking a new and progressive identity. And if this vigor sometimes seems to have about it a great hunger, this is not surpris ing. For there is an urge to experiment, to explore, to test; a desire to take nothing for granted, but to search out things as far as they extend, to look not for the horizons of yesterday but for the horizons of tomorrow (...) (The Gazette, editorial, June 24, 1964).35 In an attempt to save the icon, the Catholic Church supported the transformation. It reasoned that to be relevant and resonant, the symbol needed to change. Mgr. Paul Gosselin, Archbishop of Montréal in the 1960s, sought to demonstrate that relevance by emphasizing that the saint himself was a transitional symbol and that Québec's own transition required his guiding light: Saint John the Baptist is a transitional character. He closes the Old Testament and announces the New Testament. With him ends the era of prophets, the course toward truth, and the wait for the Messiah. After him will come the awaited Messiah, He who is the way, the truth and the life. The Baptist could be a man of our disrupted and changing times. After 2,000 years of Christianity, humanity still seeks its way. There is no lack of false prophets, even here at home, to engage humanity in the tortuous paths St. John talked about. The Lord warns us against false prophets. But then, one needs to know what is a real prophet. That is easy. One only needs to look at John the Baptist, the greatest among them. [...] What is [his] message? Is it a call to rebellion against authority, an invitation to remove God from one's conscience and from human society, a desire for emancipation from all constraint, all rules, in order to think anything and act as one wishes? On the contrary, John [the Baptist] announces a reign. He specifies an attitude. [...] The Messiah is coming. [...] Men will only 35 Note the frequent reference to the arcadian theme dismissed in the new French Canada/Québec. Arcadia refers to a Utopian vision of pastoralism and harmony with nature. The term originates from a mountainous region of Greece characterized by a sparse population of shepherds, and it developed into a poetic metaphor for idyllic wilderness. It is here used to refer to the idealized vision of rural French Canada and to the representation of the patron saint with his little lamb. £) Springer</page><page sequence="29">Thcor Soc (2013)42:423-475 451 be able to join Him through humility and the renouncing of their egoistic self, their spirit weakened by mistake [...] John is a true prophet [...]. At the end of his career, instead of asking for the heads of those who did not think like him, he offered his to the executioner. [...] False prophets engender hatred, revolt, contempt and ultimately chaos. The real ones, like the Baptist, prepare the way to truth and love. May God deliver us from those trafficking in error and safeguard the message of the Precursor, our National Patron {L'Action Catholique, June 25, 1961). In this sermon, Mgr Gosselin equated the Church with John the Baptist, and secular reformists with false prophets "calling to rebellion against authority," "invit ing the removal of God from one's conscience and society" and ultimately plainly "trafficking in error." By the mid-1960s, the Québec Church itself was undergoing radical transformation, following the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), and muffled its resistance to the secularization of Québec society (Routhier 1997; Seljak 1996). But it still attempted to rescue Saint Jean-Baptiste as the national symbol, by discursively altering the saint's defining attributes to emphasize his virility and strength of character: Saint Jean-Baptiste, our patron, was not this pale figure a certain tradition may have complacently presented. He was on the contrary a man of direct and dense words, a demanding man, a man of sweeping horizon, audacious, robust and severe. [...] He stood straight, yet knew how to disappear behind the One arriving after him and Whom he had announced the coming; he had the build of great men [...] (Mgr Gosselin's Homily, preached during the Saint-Jean Baptiste Day Mass, in L'Information nationale, July-August 1969, p. 4) The SSJBM and the Church demonstrated a keen understanding of the critiques formulated against the cherubic representation of the Saint and responded to them with creative discursive and material re-workings of the symbol. Before examining where this reworking ultimately led, I want to highlight the turning points in that process, the first key links in a long chain of significations. Material and semiotic chains of significations Thus far I have argued that the meaning of St. John the Baptist as patron saint of French Canadians and iconic figure of the nation was determined by its content—that is, by the messianic national narrative articulated by the Catholic Church in the mid-nineteenth century and emphatically promoted in the first half of the twentieth century to build an ethno-religious nation. That meaning was materialized in a specific form and aesthetics—that of the cherubic, blond and curly-haired boy clutching a docile white lamb at his side. While the ideological content drove the choice of the symbol and its specific aesthetic form, meaning also emanated from the form itself—that is, from material properties of the iconic tableau "child-saint with-lamb." Opposition to, and changes in, the aesthetic form of the symbolic config uration therefore acted recursively to shape, in turn, its content: the meaning of the symbol. â Springer</page><page sequence="30">452 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 The first step in the demise of St. John the Baptist as iconic of French Canadian identity began with critiques of the lamb/sheep, prompted by physical properties of the animal: The lamb's docility, its feeble bleat, and especially its wool became weapons in the mouths of critics of the status quo who argued for greater political autonomy and economic development, giving traction to economic and institutional reforms to come. The turning point, however, was the Church and the SSJBM reacting to those critiques by removing the lamb from the parade's last float. Although the elimination of the lamb from the symbolic tableau may appear merely anecdotal and inconsequential, it was that very alteration that set off the series of transformations that ultimately dethroned and literally dismembered St. John the Baptist. The lamb's material properties, perceived, but also "acting," within a specific historic context, prompted its removal. With the removal of the animal, however, the entire configuration of the tableau was altered. Without the lamb connoting Christ, French Canadianness was visually stripped of its providential mission, and religion was re moved from the pictorial discourse. The saint was thereby secularized. Without the lamb, moreover, the patron saint was no longer visually specifically identifiable as St. John the Baptist; all that was left was an inoffensive and insignificant little boy. What use was the child as a national patron if that child did not augur some special significance, or "prepare the way" for great events to follow? The spectators' gaze was therefore de sacralized. And here I must distinguish between two interwoven threads of sacrality that had until then surrounded the patron saint: the first, perhaps most obvious, was the religious signification of the symbol, as a Catholic saint animated by a host of beliefs and practices; the other, woven by the Catholic Church in the mid-nineteenth century to give flesh to the religious vision of the nation, is the sacralization of the saint not as religious figure but as a national icon. St-John the Baptist was thus what I called elsewhere (Zubrzycki 2006, pp. 219-220), a sacred secular symbol. It is sacred both because of its religious semantics and because of its secular, national ones. By removing the lamb, I argue, the sanctity of the saint was doubly forfeited: the saint qua religious symbol was secularized, and the saint qua national symbol was de-sacralized. Thus materially altered, the icon became both secular and profane. Once the saint's meaning was altered by the removal of the lamb at his side, the saint's representation as a child quickly disappeared, since child-saint-with-lamb were part of a single visual and semiotic configuration. Note how closely related in time both symbolic transformations occurred: the lamb was removed from the tableau-vivant in 1963, and a year later, in 1964, the child was replaced by an adult statue. His maturation, denoted by his depiction in popular magazines by a living adolescent or in the parade as an adult statue, was significant not only because it participated in Québec's own coming of age, but also because it graphically demonstrated that no sacred symbol was un touchable or beyond critical reach. Paradoxically, by tampering with the symbol it tried to save, the Church and the SSJBM participated in its desacralization and ultimate demise. The icon no longer represented a divine nation, but a secularized and thoroughly "humanistic" one; and it was no longer a sacred representation of the nation, but a profane one. Note also that the debates about "the sheep" and the child-saint and their resulting transformations occurred in the very first years of the Quiet Revolution, suggesting that they were not merely expressive of institutional transformations in progress, but constitutive of them (See Table 1). They acted as catalysts for transforma tions, a point I return to in the concluding section of this article. â Springer</page><page sequence="31">Thcor Soc (20! 3) 42:423^75 453 Table 1 Acsthctic revolt &amp; Quiet Revolution timelines â Springer</page><page sequence="32">454 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423^)75 Parades and the public reconfigurations of national identity While the icon of the nation was increasingly contested by political actors, public intellectuals and ordinary citizens during the Quiet Revolution, the parade itself also became a contested event. Its entire aesthetics was rejected: It was criticized for its kitsch and bad taste, for its dépassé form, and for its increasingly commercialized character. In the words of RIN chairman Marcel Chaput, the sponsorship of floats by businesses, many of them foreign companies "that could not care less about the French Canadian nation and [rather] only think of their investment and how much their return will be," constituted "an indecent display of servility" (La Presse, 28 June 1962). Not only were the parade's aesthetics, organization, and financing criticized, the very idea that a mere spectacle like a parade should serve as the nation's preeminent collective celebration became controversial. The parade came to be seen as emblematic of the French Canadian nation's herd-like passivity, with most watching from the sidelines while a select few did the marching. This specific critique of the event justified its serving as a staging ground to manifest discontent publicly and promote alternative ideas. Beginning in 1961, the parade became a prime target of protests and a venue where outsiders to the political process—those who were not direct agents in the on-going reforms and restructuring of the provincial state—could make their voices heard. The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parades indeed provided the perfect platform for small political groups and protesters to gain visibility. The event was always attended by dignitaries, journalists, and television crews, and was viewed by hundreds of thousands of spectators watching from Montreal's sidewalks, joined electronically by two million more watching at home on their television sets or listening to the radio broadcast. Given the potential for exposure, the parades were increasingly policed, yet constantly disrupted by protesters who regarded them as "an attempt by conservative elements to beguile people" (La Presse, June 27, 1961). Protesters tugged at multiple strings of the cat's cradle created among spectators, television crews, dignitaries, and journalists watching the parade; and floats, actors, marching bands, and majorettes, the objects of the viewing. At first the disruptions were relatively superficial: Activists stole the Union Jack, the Red Ensign, and US flags flying on various Montréal buildings in 1961 because, they explained, "the Union Jack is a foreign flag [and] the Red Ensign is not the Canadian flag," specifying that "we're not a colony of the United States eitherThat last comment is significant as it highlights how new nationalists understood Québec as being colonized by Anglo-Canadians (La Presse June 27, 1961, emphasis mine). They vociferously booed the singing of O Canada in 1966, because for a new generation of nationalists that hymn presented a religious vision of the nation that was being actively rejected and because the hymn was increasingly associated with Canada, while they were redrawing the symbolic boundaries of their own imagined community around Québec. By the end of the decade, the parade provoked violent protests. In 1968, vocal protests raised against the presence of Pierre Elliott Trudeau on the dignitaries' dais, because of his public hostility to the idea of an independent Québec, degenerated into a violent riot leading to 290 arrests and leaving 125 injured, a day remembered as "Truncheon Monday" (Lundi de la matraque) (Rose 1968; Les feux de la Saint-Jean 2002). The television broadcast of the 1968 parade did not even mention, describe, comment on, or show images of the violent riots taking places just a few feet from the &lt;0 Spring er</page><page sequence="33">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 455 dignitaries' podium, across the street in Pare Lafontaine. Radio-Canada filmed the parade as if nothing else was happening, creating a surreal event: people watching on their television sets saw elaborate floats and happy majorettes parading in front of dignitaries, when in fact the parade was being interrupted by protesters breaking the safety cordon, throwing rocks at Trudeau, and being violently clubbed by policemen a few steps from the televised spectacle.36 But if Truncheon Monday is the most remembered Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day of the 1960s in narratives of the Quiet Revolution because of its violence, it is my conten tion that the parade-turned-protest the following year was more consequential, as it cemented a new national identity. In 1969, an apparently benign occurrence turned out to be a transformative historical event (Sewell 1996). Beheading the saint: the symbolic murder of the French Canadian nation The theme of the 1969 parade was "Québec, My Love." Its 26 floats were to display all that exalted Québec: its natural beauty, cultural attractions, special events and holidays, folktales and legends, and not least its patron saint. Given the previous year's turn of events, the parade was again scheduled for the afternoon hours, and 1,000 police officers in uniform lined the streets of Montréal, on alert to intervene. The "putsch" on the parade began with caustic humor, as a discursive subterfuge on Radio-Canada's televised broadcast. The two parade commentators narrating on "live" television mocked the event they were supposed to dignify in their descriptions on the air: Commentator 1: Let's say that the parade gets 500,000 spectators in Montréal. That means at least 1,000,000 Montrealers are not coming! How do you think they're celebrating Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, if they celebrate it at all?[...] Commentator 2: They're watching the parade at home on the television, I suppose. Commentator 1: I've got another explanation: I think that the most extraordi nary way to celebrate the parade-and if I were not here commenting today that's where I'd be—is to go trout fishing. Commentator 2: But Pierre, it's only because you can't play the drums that you say that. Commentator 1: [...] The parade is on E. Sherbrooke Street. [...] Who's that, Sherbooke? Do you know? Commentator 2: Sherbrooke, no idea. Commentator 1: You don't know? Me neither! We're not at home! Thankfully there's Lafontaine Park just behind. There, some great things happened, I think. The commentators opened their remarks, then, with a critique of this mode of national celebration, highlighting on the one hand the passivity it generates (one million staying a home) and suggesting that there were indeed better things to do on that day than to watch a parade (going trout fishing). They also highlighted the colonial legacy by mocking the fact that Montreal's most important and longest 36 On the disjuncture between the events and their "live" television broadcast, see the documentary Les feux de la Saint-Jean. â Springer</page><page sequence="34">456 Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 street—it is 19 miles long—is named after someone who has had very little resonance in the history of Québec.

In that segment, they also cynically referred to Truncheon Monday, via a reference to Pare Lafontaine, where "great things" happened.

No! This is not what I want to hear. I'd like to hear: "Québec, my country"! I think it's much more intense, and we really need to hear that we have a country. [...] That's what the parade is for!

We're neither for nor against [the parade and its representation of French Canadianness]. In other words, we're not here to make compliments. Finally, they criticized the commodification of the parade and mocked French Canadians' lack of pride: [...] Commentator 1: Well, it's starting. "Québec knows how"—Government of Québec.

In that last comment, they jokingly referred to the mushrooming of new ministries created in the 1960s (Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Revenue, Ministry of Provincial-Federal relations, and so forth), but by the same token underlined the absence of Ministries, Agencies, or Institutions that actually actively promoted an emergent Québécois identity. The commentators therefore not only criticized the parade and the problems of Québec it emblematized through its pictorial discourse; they also openly expressed their support for the sovereignty of Québec by affirming Québec to be their country. It took 31 minutes for the producers to realize the on-going sabotage and four more to take the commentators off the air. The televised parade then proceeded more or less as planned, but soon after the last float was paraded in front of the television crews and the dignitaries' podium, protesters left the confines of the "spectators' area" on Montreal's sidewalks to take over the street. The official parade was thereafter followed by an unofficial one, referred to as the "parallel parade" by television announcers, with thousands of protesters marching just behind the float carrying, that year, a papier mâché statue of Saint Jean-Baptiste on a futuristic float. The protesters carried placards on which they said to be "fed up with Saint Jean [celebrations] on the sidewalk," a powerful double-entendre directly referring to that specific mode of celebration, but also to the economic situation of French Canadians, for "to be on the sidewalk" ("être sur le trottoir") is an expression signifying to be destitute. They also claimed in their chants "to be in the street" and incited the Québécois "[to] take the street" [Québécois, dans la rue!]. Proclaiming their solidarity with anti-colonial movements in Vietnam and Latin America, they argued that Québec's own situation should be understood in those very terms (Fig. 8). The Front de libération populaire distributed pamphlets in which they linked the French Canadians' economic situation and discrimination in the labor market to the Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrations: We have the lowest salaries in Canada; We represent 45 % of the unemployed in Canada; We are thrown out of work like garbage [...]; We, first arrived in America, are the last to be able to speak our language to earn a living; Ô Springer</page><page sequence="36">- * &lt;r 'Vv Silted P£&lt;X';. ■ftei Mint-Jam &gt;srlc troltoit | Fig. 8 Protesters followed the parade in the street, June 24th, 1969.

[Pamphlet distributed by the Front de libération populaire, quoted in Journal de Montréal June 24, 1969, original emphasis). As expressed above, for the small Marxist group Front de libération populaire and other Leftist organizations, St John the Baptist and the St-Jean-Baptiste Day festivities celebrated the very dependence, exploitation, and passivity of the people. To change the people and create the nation, they considered essential to abolish French Canadian's "servile mentality," symbolized by the saint and embodied by the parade. They thus organized a march to protest against the parade and to campaign for the active partici pation of the people in national affairs. They were joined by several thousands of bystanders, who followed the parade on its trajectory, gathering momentum and fervor as more spectators joined the march. By the time they reached the west side of Montréal, there were between 10,000 and 15,000 protesters marching in the "parallel parade." The crowd was dense and excited, especially around and behind the Saint-Jean-Baptiste float. One subgroup trailed the float for several miles. Suddenly, in front of the Ritz Carlton Hotel—an edifice of Anglophone power and wealth—several of its members seized the saint's float and, quickly lifting one side over their heads, spectacularly overturned it, breaking the statue's head and detaching it from the body in the process (Fig. 9).37 Although there is no indication that the saint was actually ritually beheaded, the fact that it was the head that was ruptured from the body (and not, for example, an arm or his staff), provided the perfect script to narrate the event, because this is how St. John the Baptist, in the Christian Bible, meets his end. St. John the Baptist's biblical murder provided the script both for the gesture's interpretation and for the language of its 37 It is worth noting that the float was overturned just as it passed the Ritz on Montreal's west-side, the richer, anglophone side of town. Here were two symbols sharing space for a brief instant: One that had become, throughout the 1960s, associated with French Canadian servility and economic backwardness; the other synonymous • with Anglophone wealth. Although it is impossible to determine the feelings of protestors at that moment—historical record has no mention of those—it is possible the juxtaposition of both symbols caused a surge of anger in protesters, who then destroyed the icon accused of legitimating and ultimately participating in the exploitation of those the Church claimed to represent. ö Springer</page><page sequence="37">Fig. 9 St John the Baptist's float, overturned.

From the personal archives of Denys Deläge description. The protesters were referred to as "headsmen" (Le Journal de Montréal June 26, 1969) and their action was qualified as the national saint's "decapitation" (Le Journal de Montréal June 24, 1969; Le Devoir June 25, 1969). "The saint's head rolled," one newspaper announced, "serving as a trophy" for Herod-like political elites (La Patrie June 29, 1969) (Fig. 10). The parade as a whole was described in the press as a "massacre" (La Presse June 25, 1969) and its culmination was interpreted as the Québécois finally "axing this Épinal image" (La Presse June 25, 1969).38 In short order, the attack on the saint's float was presented as a sign of the symbol's inescapable destiny instead of being blamed as mere vandalism by over-enthusiastic youth. The action can be best described as what Bruno Latour has called "iconoclash" (2002). Unlike iconoclasm, when the destructive intent and what motivates it are clear, iconoclash is characterized by an ambiguity among the intent of the actors, their action, and its reception. In this case, what is ambiguous is whether the youth who attacked and overturned the saint's float meant actually to behead the saint or "merely" disrupt the parade by the desecration of the patron saint. The ambiguity of the gesture itself was, however, effaced through a specific narrative provided by the biblical script, a narrative that was cemented by the visual reproduction of the headless body in the press during the days that followed.~,9That interpretation stuck, given the biblical script and after nearly a 38 "Images of Épinal" were popular 18th and 19th prints depicting religious tableaux or traditional scenes of everyday life. The name of this artistic genre comes from the city where they were first printed and popularized, Epinal (France). The expression "image d'Epinal" refers, in its figurative sense, to a traditional and naïvely positive portrayal of life. It is in that sense that the commentator cited above described the beheading of Saint Jean-Baptiste as "axing this Epinal image." 39 The statue's head was never found, but rumors circulated to the effect that it was passed from one group to another as a trophy of the "killing" {La Patrie June 29, 1969). ö Springer</page><page sequence="38">(Jemembre U jymb ^^lie constttuf probablemtnf an au rettt d» U depouillc, on I'a d&lt; la ttatuaf* jrondoor:!

The actual murder of the saint thus happened after the parade-tumed-protest; not in the protesters' violent act itself (or not solely in that act), but rather in the media's discursive interpretation and visual narration of the act as an iconoclastic one (i.e., as an intentional act). The theoretical significance of iconoclash, in this case, is that it highlights the crucial links among materiality (the broken, headless papier mâché statue), visuality (photos of the headless statue reproduced and disseminated in the public sphere), and narrative (the broken statue referred to as "beheaded" following the biblical script). It also suggests that the "beheading" of Saint John the Baptist was not like other forms of symbolic beheadings and other dismemberments, such as the willful and highly ritualized decap itation of figures of saints in Revolutionary France, which were by definition iconoclastic. The "decapitation" of the patron saint was also widely interpreted as another blow inflicted on the Catholic Church and the ethno-religious vision of national identity by left-leaning nationalists. The prayer-commentary of a self-defined "French Canadian who's ha[d] enough," published as a letter to the editor of the populist Journal de Montréal, shows how debates about St. John the Baptist went hand in hand with institutional transformations and pushed forward a new vision of the nation that the reader rejected: O, Jean-Baptiste, twice beheaded: the first time for Herod's pleasure, the second for René Lévesque and company,40 40 The charismatic Rcnc Lévesque quickly outshone Premier Jean Lesage and became the "poster boy" of the Quiet Revolution, having conducted one of most ambitious and important mandates of the revolution, the nationalization of electricity and the creation of Hydro-Québec. â Springer</page><page sequence="39">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423^175 461 Have mercy on our misery and cowardice.

For the prayer's author, the society created through the Quiet Revolution was a truncated one; the secularization of Québec is described as its own beheading; and the removal of the Catholic Church from its traditional domains, like education, is felt as the amputation of a limb from the nation's body. While some deplored the torturing and ultimate killing of the saint and the society it created, others applauded what that accomplished. In an interview clarifying his derogatory comments on the television station of Radio-Canada, film-maker Pierre Perrault ("Commentator 1") declared, a few days after the parade-protest: The days of papier mâché are over. For too long, people were given drums and trumpets to keep silent. That's not how one builds a country. As far as I'm concerned, the real parade happened when we had already been taken off the air. The real parade [it] was the young people that arrived en masse after the last floats, to overturn the statue of Saint Jean-Baptiste. We have a country to build. It's no time to make speeches and line-up majorettes. That is just another way to distract people and keep them silent (Le Petit Journal June 29, 1969). In this ad-libbed interview, Perrault brilliantly uses the saint and the fragile material of his construction that year to critique the French Canadian national project (or lack thereof). By claiming the end of the papier mâché days, he directly refers to the destruction of the statue of St. Jean-Baptiste and "pronounces the death" of French Canada, which the saint represents. The statement, "The days of papier mâché are over," also suggested the need for sturdier materials of nation-building. That nation, however, should not merely be "cultural," like the recently defunct French Canada, but political: a country. As such, it requires solid, long-lasting construction materials. Perrault further equates the noisy diversions of "drums and trumpets" with 41 The Ministry of Education was creatcd in 1964. Its foundation was controversial for some since it took education away from the control of the Catholic Church (even though education remained confessional). 42 The term "energumen" has a theological origin and denotes a person possessed by an evil spirit. It has come to mean, in both French and English, a fanatic, wild enthusiast. While it is of rare usage in English, it is quite common in French.

The annual parades therefore also needed to be abolished in order for genuine nation building actions to be carried out; in order for Québec to become a country. Perrault's words were prescient. The traditional parade never returned, and the rupture effectively closed a chapter in Québec history. Verbal attacks on, and material reworkings of, St. Jean-Baptiste throughout the 1960s until its final iconoclastic destruction in 1969—what I have called aesthetic revolt— in effect killed Catholic French-Canadianness to leave full room to a rising secular Québécois identity. The saint is dead, long live the nation! Identity reconfigured In its infancy in the 1970s, the new nation needed to be taught and transmitted from the vanguard to "the people," and viscerally rehearsed in order to be made real in their minds and bodies. Gone were the saint, his lamb, and the parade. Some of the very actors involved in the discursive destruction of the icon were invited to "rethink" the St. Jean-Baptiste celebrations. Pierre Perrault, "Commentator 1" who declared in 1969 that "the days of papier mâché were over," replaced the parade the following year with a "popular march" through Montreal's historic neighborhoods and orga nized large communitarian picnics. In the mid-1970s, June 24th became the occasion of impressive "Woodstock-like" concerts and parties that lasted several days on Mont-Royal, a large park in the heart of Montréal. And in 1977, the Parti Québécois' separatist (and secularist) government, which came to power in 1976, institutional ized June 24th as Québec 's legal national holiday.43 "La Fête Nationale," the holiday's official designation, has since been celebrated with rock concerts, fireworks, and public bonfires where the nation's bards and political figures renew their allegiance to Québec amidst a sea of blue and white fleurdelisé flags, a spectacle whose aesthetics could not be more different from those of the traditional parades (Fig. 11). Although it is celebrated on June 24th, the Catholic heritage of the holiday has been thoroughly purged from the holiday and occluded even in the documentation of the institution responsible for the organization of the Fête.44 In official publications and on the government's website, ample 43 Decree no. 1600-77, May 18, 1977.

René Lévcsquc dressed in a prophet's robe is shown "canonizing" the saint/Holiday by nationalizing him with the words: "Jean, on this people and for this people I shall build a country." Over John's head is a fleur de lys halo. This is a clever play on Jesus telling Peter "You arc Peter, and on this rock I will build my church (Matthew 16: 18). In French, Peter and rock are the same word ["Tu es Pierre, et sur cette pierre tu bâtiras mon Eglise]; here John (Jean) and people (gens) sound identical. It is the secularization/nationalization of the Holiday that makes it holy, implied by the fleur de lys halo over Jean-Baptiste's head.

A century of extraordinary celebrations are simply disregarded, silencing an important chapter in the history of the holiday in Québec and exorcising the ethno-religious genesis of the French Canadian nation prior to its Québécois redefinition. While the holiday is still commonly referred to as "La Saint Jean," few under the age of 45 can explain why the nation is celebrated on that specific day and referred to by that name.45 The reconfiguration of national identity in the 1960s was therefore not only carried out in institutions and through the renegotiation of Church-state relations. It was also operated through an aesthetic revolt led by left-wing nationalists who rejected one vision of the nation and proposed a new one. That rejection was effected in discursive repudiations, material reworkings of symbols, and narrative reversals across a decade, when parades became the platforms for protests that chipped away at the iconic casting of ethno-Catholic French Canadianness. Still, the choice of June 24 as the central national celebration monumentalizes in a sense the failure of the separatist national project since the continued use of the saint's day as the National Holiday indexes the conspicuous absence of an Independence Day for Québec. The Precursor was beheaded and the Lamb of God sacrificed, yet the new covenant never arrived.46 Toward a cultural sociology of national identity How is national identity reconfigured? What is the role of symbols and aesthetics in that process? Based on archival and ethnographic data, this article has examined the shifting meaning of St. John the Baptist in Québec during the 1960s, though an analysis of the national icon's content and form. I have suggested that by virtue of the icon embodying the dominant national vision, and the parades in his honor pictorially narrating and performing that vision, the saint became the object of contestation and the target of an aesthetic revolt through which social actors reformed and ultimately transformed their national identity. By doing so, I demonstrated that national identity is constructed and redefined not only in and through official ideologies and institu tional re-arrangements, but also through popular rituals such as parades and protests where social actors manipulate and transform core symbols of the nation. In what follows, I specify the findings of the study and articulate the broader contributions of this cultural sociology of national identity formation and transformation. 45 Based on ethnographic evidence collected through participant observation in Saint-Jean-Baptiste cele brations in 2007,2008, and 2009. On selective memory and the invention of tradition in 1970's Québec, see Handler (1988). 46 Mona Ozouf (1988) argued that festivals in revolutionary France were designed to operate a transference of sacrality, because a society must sacralize the very deed of its institution, of its creation. Yet the post 1969 instantiation of la fete nationale does not attempt to do accomplish that, perhaps because "Québec" was socially, but not politically, instituted in 1969. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="42">464 Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 Fig. 11 A new national aesthetic developed in the 1970s. Here, the celebration of the Fête Nationale in Montréal in 2010. http://fetenationale-montreal.qc.ca/gallery/photos2010/ Symbols and aesthetic revolt Symbols are not merely reflective and derivative of structures, but constitutive of those structures (Sewell 1996). A rich and diverse scholarship (e.g., Turner 1967; Geertz 1973; Swidler 1986; Hunt 1986; Ozouf 1988; Kertzer 1988; Sewell 1996, 2005; Zubrzycki 2006) has convincingly demonstrated the importance of symbols and rituals as vehicles of identity formation as they not only express but also create and propel political transformations, or switch their "track," to follow Weber's metaphor. What was not fully examined in that literature, however, is why that is so. I have shown here that new identifications are made possible through social actors' implicit faith in icons' transforming power. But unlike Alexander's theory of iconic consciousness (2008,2012), I established that this attribution of power-in-objects is not "totemic," à la Dürkheim—the sacralization, in a material object, of society as it is—but rather "polemic"—the graphic pressing of claims through symbols about how society should (or should not) be. Symbols serve to focus, magnify, and exaggerate particular features of national identity, which allows social actors, in turn, to contest given representations and narratives and rearticulate new ones. Their material embodiment is thus especially relevant because it affords actors to manipulate and transform them, as they can be handled, molded, elevated, turned, fragmented and inverted. In this case, the lamb was removed from the tableau-vivant, the saint was enlarged to "grow up," the float was overturned, the saint was beheaded. While narrative focuses on ideological content, I demonstrated how important visual and material form is, as the form can alter the content, sometimes following a logic of its own. These formal transformations, however, are not isolated but are part of complex chains of significations, within performative events in a specific historical context. For Ô Springer</page><page sequence="43">Theor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 465 example: one mode of action (say, verbal critics of the lamb) brought about another action (the physical removal of the lamb from the saint's float). Once materially altered, the icon was secularized and its apparent sanctity as a national symbol was forfeited; St. John the Baptist became "fair game" for further attacks, attacks that were no longer merely verbal invectives, but now even physical assault. The very materials the symbol was made of, moreover, indexed its progressive frailty and exposure, but also made further manipulations possible: from the flesh and bone of the "little Saint Jean Baptiste," to the majestic bronze statue, to the modern wooden sculpture, to its final papier mâché incarnation. The ever more transitory constitution of the saint foreshadowed and mirrored, but also invited, his hastened decay as well as facilitated the interpretation of his final public appearance as the saint's murder. These manipulations in the material form of the icon and the chains of significa tions these created, moreover, were especially powerful because of the parades. As the patron saint occupied a prominent public stage and his parades enjoyed a vast spectatorship, the icon's weakening and final transfiguration was all the more potent. In fact, the "beheading" proved transformative because of the parade. These annual performances, I have shown, were key venues where the icon (and the national vision it embodied) was creatively produced, displayed, and viewed. They provided signif icant occasions for the reworking of the symbol and the platform for the accelerated secularization of national identity, and all with the largest audience possible. The very public nature of these ritual performances—the fact that they were visually and aurally (and even, occasionally, tactilely, in the case of protestors overturning the float) received by large groups en masse, with key images reproduced and circulated in mass media the following days, and then remembered in relation to already-extant public scripts—all of this was central, even constitutive of the historical event and its transformative consequences. More than reflective of, they were integral to, the on going process of "social becoming" during the Quiet Revolution (Sztompka 1993). It was only by carefully taking into account 1) Material properties of the icon and its symbolic configuration with the lamb; 2) tracing the slow movement of the float in parades through its manifold instantiations over nearly a decade, and 3) analyzing the particular discursive and visual narration made of the event in the press and its interpretation in the public sphere, that we can grasp the full significance of the "beheading." Without paying attention to those dimensions of aesthetic revolt, it would be difficult to explain how a new national identity could dislodge another one so rapidly and forcefully. One take-away point of this study, then, is that the force of symbols resides not only in their content, but also in their form and the stages on which they are displayed and contested. Blinks, winks, and historical transformations Here I want to return to the key moments in the transformation of the symbolic structure of the tableau to highlight the relationship between agency, unintentional actions, and consequential historical change. While the lamb was intentionally removed from the tableau-vivant, that removal had significant but unforeseen conse quences: it altered the meaning of the child and hastened his replacement with an adult statue a year later. In the case of the St. John the Baptist, however, his unintentional "decapitation" had on the contrary all too predictable consequences: Although the head rolling on the ground had been accidentally ruptured from his â Springer</page><page sequence="44">466 Thcor Soc (2013) 42:423-475 body when the saint's float was overturned, it was easily seen as a decapitation because of the narrative force of the saint's biblical story that bounded and channeled the reception of those visual cues. In other words, the blink was interpreted as a wink, to borrow Clifford Geertz's famed example of the difference between thin and thick descriptions, and between unintentional and meaningful, i.e., "cultural" action. The unintentional action's meaning was therefore discursively conditioned; it was pro vided by the biblical script. Thus the material manipulations' consequences were more evident and immediately legible in the case of St. John the Baptist than in the case of the lamb because the biblical story of the saint's life constrained how it could be read (or seen, to be more accurate). Consider, to wit, the following scenarios: the float is overturned but the statue of the saint remains intact; or its left foot is broken; or the statue is defaced with paint. It is difficult to envision these outcomes having the same impact as the accidental breaking off of the saint's head, because they do not resonate with the biblical story. St. John the Baptist's biblical murder therefore provided the script for the gesture's interpretation and the language to describe it; the visual reproduction of the beheaded corpse in the press during the days that followed hardened the interpretation of the event as a deliberate iconoclastic gesture. The action's interpretation and subsequent narration (both textual and visual) in the media as the willful murder of the saint, constituted an "act of signification" (Sewell 1996, p. 861). That the wink was most likely initially a blink is not relevant here. The interpretation and narration of the event were more consequential than the misrecognition of the actors' intentionality (or lack thereof). As William H. Sewell Jr. points out, the symbolic interpretation of events on the part of social actors themselves "is part and parcel of the historical event" (ibid., p. 861) and the historical sociologist, benefiting from temporal distance and analytical insight, can see the breaking off of the head (blink) for what it became: a beheading (wink). This act of signification, of seeing the headless statue of Saint Jean-Baptiste lying in the street as beheaded corpse, then, necessarily implied dis posing of the patron saint and abolishing the parade in his honor. After all, John, unlike his cousin, did not resurrect. Because of the biblical story, "repair" of the symbol was impossible, making a novel articulation of national identity, that of secular Québécois, possible. The beheading, therefore, marked the "death" of French Canada as a viable national vision and institutionalized that transformation through the abolition of the annual parade and the creation of new modes of celebration for the new nation. While at first glance appearing anecdotal, upon closer investigation the "happening" is revealed to have been in fact a historic "event" (Sewell 1996). The key analytical point here is that the effects of the symbolic manipulations are embedded in the material logic and discursive penumbra of the symbols themselves on the one hand, and in the broader historical conjuncture and specific performative context of the parade on the other. The lamb's and the saint's potential orbits of meaning depended, I showed, on their material features: that a lamb/sheep is vulnerable, woolly, and pastoral. All of this mattered in the course of events and their interpretations that followed; likewise with the saint's vaiying age and maturity or, when cast as a sculpture, the materials of his construction. The relative mobility of the objects was a salient feature of their materiality in the events that followed as well: While the removal of the lamb and the saint's decapitation did not have the same power of transformation, each removal had Springer</page><page sequence="45">Theor Soc (2013)42:423-475 467 consequences that originated in the symbols' materiality and the interpretation of specific material features. The similarity between the two removals however hides an important difference. The removal of the lamb took on special significance only in relation to the remaining element of the tableau—the child-saint—whose meaning was radically altered by the animal's omission. The overturning of the float and decapitation of the saint, however, were in themselves significant because of the biblical story that suggested meaning to the action. Yet, the severing of the head from the saint's body could only be read according to the biblical script because the saint was represented as an adult—a metamorphosis, I have shown, prompted by the initial removal of the lamb, which rendered the child-saint incomprehensible and required his replacement by a mature figure. And the lamb was removed, I showed, because some material elements of the animal—its wool—came to be significant in the context of the Quiet Revolution's emphasis on "rattrapage" and economic reforms. That entire chain of events, finally, was impactful because it was forged in the public sphere, for all to see, in the days before, during and following the annual St-Jean-Baptiste Day Parades. This case thus shows that the properties of symbols intersect with, but are not strictly limited to, human intentionality. They take part, "act," in the causation of events—in this case, the transformation or even conversion of national identity. The article thus invites social scientists to expand their notions of social action to take into account the power exerted by material symbols. Final words It is thanks to a cultural sociology of aesthetic revolt that we arrive at understanding the varied process through which a new identity was formed and established as salient in the public sphere by the end of 1960s' Québec. My analysis pinpointed the specific interconnections between the discursive, visual, material, and performative spheres, and how they converged to reject ethno-Catholic French Canadian identity and ossify an emergent vision of national identity that was still up for grabs until the fateful attack on the saint's float and its discursive and pictorial narration in the public sphere as a "death by beheading." The analysis also opens up new theoretical questions about historical change, collective memory, and eventful sociology. While the effacement of the association of today's "fête nationale" with the saint's nameday is not all that surprising, what is more puzzling is the mnemonic erasure of the veiy moment that made possible the transition from a Catholic French Canadian to a secular Québécois identity; the 1969 beheading of the saint. Why are some occurrences or happenings (the taking of the Bastille, for example) elevated to the rank of "events"—their historical significance often inflated—while others, despite their historical significance, are deflated or conflated to the point of their disappearance from the narrative of the nation's genesis? I do not answer that question here, but one lead this article does suggest is that the concept of aesthetic revolt allows us to uncover the eventfulness of events that have been relegated to the margins of national narratives.

Author of the award-winning book The Crosses of Auschwitz: Nationalism and Religion in Post-Communist Poland (University of Chicago Press 2006; Polish translation, Nomos 2014), she studies national identity and religion; collective memory, mythology, and the politics of commemoration; and the contested place of religious symbols in the public sphere. Zubrzycki is currently completing a new book on nationalism, religion, and secularism in Quebec, and continuing work on religion and symbolic boundary-making in another project on the on-going Jewish revival in Poland and non-Jewish Poles' interest in all things Jewish. â Springer</page></plain_text>
