<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humpty Dumpty 35 Humpty Dumpty: A Screen Memory and Some Speculations on the Nursery Rhyme Recently, in an old volume of The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, I came across a paper by Thomas A. Petty, "The Tragedy of Humpty Dumpty" (1953) which I had over looked in the past. In this paper, the author shows how, in three clinical cases, the tragic fall of Humpty Dumpty had become equated with the older child's feeling of having been displaced by the birth of a sibling and having irretrievably and disastrously fallen from a previous exalted position. In the material presented by the author, this old nursery rhyme came to represent at the same time a reenactment of this trauma, an attempt to master it and an outlet for the older child's hostile wishes towards the younger one. Interestingly enough, while the author focuses through out the paper on the seriousness of the fall and the irrepara bility of its consequences as the origins of this equation, he glides over the fact that Humpty Dumpty was an egg. He writes, in other words, of Humpty Dumpty as if it were only any kind of extremely fragile and unmendable object. This paper brought to mind a patient I saw in my pre analytic days during World War II who presented me with a very interesting screen memory which showed some re markable analogies to the patients described by Petty and which bore a relationship to the Humpty Dumpty motif. A brief description of the clinical facts in this case will enable us to broaden our understanding of the psychoanalytic meaning of this nursery rhyme and to discuss some of the psychological mechanisms which underlay this patient's screen memory. The patient was a 26 year old European Jewish refugee The author extends his warmest thanks to Dr. Phyllis Greenacre for pointing out some pertinent literature and for communicating clinical impressions which will be mentioned in the course of this paper.

Almansi of recent immigration who came from a very conservative and traditional background. The family was extremely close. He was the older of two children and, prior to his brother's birth, had slept in his parents' bedroom. During that period, he had been told subsequently, he had been suffering from intense night fears. He was not married and lived with his parents who were extremely protective of him. The family had owned an important business in Eu rope in which the patient had worked prior to his arrival in this country. Here, the father had been able to start a very small business in which the patient helped him. From this and several other indications, I received the impression that he had basically a very passive, dependent personality with some indication of regression, particularly in the oral sphere. This patient came to my attention in connection with a hypomanic attack, his first, which lasted approximately four or five months and required several weeks of hospitaliza tion. In the course of this period, he was extremely excit able, hyperactive, overtalkative. He made unrealistically large plans for his business activities and was overly optimis tic. There was a definite fugue of ideas. His speech was disconnected and rambling. The thought content was shal low and his judgment very poor. One factor which seemed to have had a significant pre cipitating effect on this attack was the fact that his younger brother who was in the Army (whereas the patient had been rejected for psychiatric reasons) had received a somewhat unusual confidential assignment which had impressed the patient rather unrealistically as being extremely prestigious. The patient spoke a great deal of this assignment: In his manic talk, he identified strongly with the brother; in his ramblings, with an all knowing smile and a triumphant glint in his eyes, he often said explosively in a loud voice "mili tary secrets!". In his mind, he fully shared his brother's newly found supposed arcane knowledge and importance. After the attack subsided, I saw the patient a few more time for psychotherapy and in the course of one of these visits, the conversation turned to his early memories. He said he had no memories whatsoever before his tenth year,</page><page sequence="3">Humpty Dumpty 37 then pondered the matter further and said this was not actually so. He remembered the day his brother was born. He was five years old and the mother was delivered at home. He remembered clearly that his father took him in the morning by trolley to the home of an aunt where he stayed all day playing a game which he remembered most clearly. He had found in a closet some shoe boxes which he attached to each other to make a train. In the kitchen, he found some flour and some paper bags each of which he filled with flour and put a bag in each shoe box. Then he pulled the train throughout the house making the noise of a train in motion. In the evening, the father came to take him home. His recollections, very vivid up to the point where he was climbing the stairs, suddenly ceased. At this point he stopped and I pointed out to him how interesting it was that while he remembered so many de tails, he could not recall the most important thing that had happened that day; namely that he had seen his brother for the first time. Then I asked him two questions: 1) What had he known about trains? He replied that the apartment in which he had always lived abroad from the time of his birth overlooked the railroad freight yards and from a window he could see the trains coming and going. 2) What had he known at the time about the way babies come into the world? He immediately answered that he had been told by his parents that when a married couple wanted a child they wrote to a special factory in Paris and the baby was shipped by parcel post. He again stopped as if he had been reflect ing and, after a short pause, became animated and said that he did not know why, but something had just come to his mind, a story that had been repeated many times in his home. He had always been a very good boy; but around the age of four and a half, he had done something entirely out of character. He had found a basket full of eggs on the kitchen floor, had dragged the basket up to a chair and on to the table; he then stood on the table near the edge and one by one let all the eggs drop to the floor. At this point, I asked him whether he remembered what he knew at the time about eggs, and he immediately answered that he had known very well that chickens came out of eggs.</page><page sequence="4">38 RenatoJ. Almansi The relationship of the patients studied by Petty to the riddle of Humpty Dumpty was based essentially on two fac tors: 1) On one side, there was the feeling of anger at the birth of a younger sibling accompanied by an overwhelming feeling that a horrible and totally irreparable tragedy had occurred. In Petty's words: "The birth cannot be undone (the infant cannot be returned whence it came from), the lost position in parental esteem cannot be regained and the nar cissistic damage cannot be repaired any more than can an egg once it has fallen". 2) On the other side, in the three cases he described, there were direct references to Humpty Dumpty. In the first case, a four and a half year old after his younger brother had almost fallen into the fireplace, batted a balloon doll of Humpty Dumpty with a broom, balanced it on the firescreen and caught it when it was about to fall into the fire. Very shortly afterwards, while jockeying with the brother for the mother's attention, he bit a hole in the Humpty Dumpty balloon and thus deflated it. In the second case, a twenty-six months old boy stuffed into the mailbox attached to the front door and handled in a hostile way a Humpty Dumpty doll which in his game was definitely iden tified with his younger brother and with a baby doll kanga roo with which his mother, prior to the brother's birth, had introduced him to the idea of pregnancy and birth. The third case, an adult analytic patient, after having been com plimented by his parents for a success in his career and hav ing heard them complain greatly about his younger brother who had caused much concern, dreamed of himself in a triumphant position throwing down with great force an egg shaped ball. Various details of this dream were definitely connected with the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme which had recurred to the patient periodically for as long as he could remember without any apparent cause. His associa tions to it led directly to the rhyme itself, to the games of catch which he had played with his brother, games in which he most often was the pitcher, to the sullen and resentful behavior of some cousins at the time a new sibling was born and to childhood fights in which he was occasionally over come by a feeling of weakness in his right arm as he was about to strike his opponent.</page><page sequence="5">Humpty Dumpty 39 In the patient described in this paper, there were no direct references to the nursery rhyme and, in fact, I greatly doubt that this patient, a recently immigrated Euro pean, had ever even heard about it. Even so, no doubt what occurred in this case bears, conceptually speaking, a very close relationship to the cases described by Petty as it fo cuses on the essential point of the whole matter, that we are dealing with an egg, the egg from which chicks and, in the patients' fantasies, children are born. In my patient, while the screen memory obviously portrayed his dislike to con front the inevitable, the reality of his brother's existence, the egg breaking spree which had preceded it by some months portrayed most vividly his intense murderous wishes against him. It is of interest to try to reconstruct the apparent se quence of psychological events which took place in this pa tient. Obviously, some time before the egg episode, on the basis of his knowledge of the relationship between eggs and the birth of chicks, he had already come to disbelieve to a considerable extent his parents' fictitious version of how children come into the world. Although the very brief con tact I had with this patient and the particular circumstances of his condition did not permit me to go deeply, it is not unreasonable to suppose that his concluding that much more than a parcel post from Paris was involved in the birth of children may have also been strongly influenced by pri mal scene experiences. This seems to have been echoed, more than twenty years later, in the "military secrets" in which he felt he had become so triumphantly a participant. It is clear that the whole period after the patient was first told of the forthcoming event was characterized by a ferment of mental questioning, debating and hypothesizing regarding the exact mechanism of the birth process. Was it going to be a package or something similar to an egg? And, in either case, how did the baby get there in the first place? The investigative aspect of the egg breaking episode clearly transpires through the deliberate, almost clinical coolness with which he let all the eggs drop, one by one, while stand ing on the edge of the table and watching them break on the floor.</page><page sequence="6">40 Renato J. Almansi Also, the egg breaking episode witnesses to the murder ous aggression mobilized by the news of the new baby's expected arrival. In this respect, the patient's reaction was violent and unambiguous: that egg had to be destroyed. But, as time wore on, as the mother kept getting bigger and bigger and the preparations for the baby's birth became obvious, the inevitability of the event and the need to con trol his aggression increasingly made itself felt. By the time the birth actually occurred, very powerful defenses against his murderous impulses had been mobilized which led him to fall back on a compromise position facilitated by the par ents' specious explanation: the newcomer had merely to be shipped back or, at least, as an alternative, his existence had to be ignored. In the screen memory, this was paralleled by the splitting off of consciousness at the point where he had reached the staircase to his apartment and by the general withdrawal of affect which characterized the screen mem ory (whereas the affect had transpired very clearly in the egg breaking episode). In this connection, it is also worth noting how the con tent of the screen memory itself, with the exception of his mention of the father, related exclusively to inanimate ob jects. This erasure of objects was described by Werman (1977) in nostalgia which represents in his opinion both a screen memory and a screen affect involving a displacement of the affective-cognitive memory from the object to an idealized place with which the object was associated, a de fensive process stemming from the need to repress intolera bly painful memories of the object. The transition of feelings which enabled the patient to establish relative control over the trauma paralleled the pro gressive ascendancy of his ego and superego functions which brought about better control over instinctual de mands and aggression, a firmer sense of reality and a better ability to tolerate anxiety. The importance of the stage of ego and superego development in the formation and dy namics of screen memories has been emphasized by Green acre in her 1949 paper on screen memories. One interest ing aspect of my patient's ego functioning at the time of his brother's birth was that the screen memory did not merely</page><page sequence="7">Humpty Dumpty 41 serve defensive purposes but also converted painful affects into a pleasurable experience. The game that he had played with the shoe boxes obviously served a restitutive function. The final episode in the sequence of events described above occurred on the revival of the patient's feeling of jealousy towards the brother at the time of his manic attack: at that time, faced with what appeared to him to be undeni able evidence of his brother's success in a life situation which was inaccessible to him he found refuge in a psy chotic process which involved an identification with him and with the successful oedipal father. This identification also served defensive and restitutive purposes. In this re spect, this patient is reminiscent of the case described by Greenson (1954) in whom a "chronic good mood," a screen affect, a countercathexis against depression and aggression was made possible by the extensive use of negation and denial of perceptions. This overview of the dynamic factors connected with the screen memory would not be complete without mention of the fact that besides the painful aspects connected with the brother's birth, the screen memory, on a deeper level, also defended the patient against a complex basic charac terological structure involving his passivity, dependency, and his orality and especially his fear of object loss. These characteristics appeared again and even more obviously when about thirty years later, he came to see me again. He had married shortly after the interruption of his treatment and had been moderately successful in his work and in his life in general. He related to me that what dis turbed him most at that time was his wife's cold and de tached attitude towards him. He was somewhat depressed and had come to me mainly to complain about her and to see if he could get from me some useful pointers about changing her attitude. Several times in the course of this visit, with a pouting expression on his face and eyes full of supplication, like a little imploring child he said: "Would it be so difficult for her to give me a kiss, just a little kiss?" After this one session, he never came to see me again. I suspect from several minor indications, that he was disap pointed that I had not given him the magic formula and</page><page sequence="8">42 RenatoJ. Almansi disturbed because my fee for the interview, although rea sonable, was much higher than the one that I had charged him originally. This case-material fully confirms Petty's observations and leaves no doubt that the rhyme of Humpty Dumpty is, as it were, a ready-made metaphor for the feelings of an older child who feels displaced by a newcomer and may, therefore, very easily work itself into the productions of certain patients who are having problems along such lines. This view is also confirmed by two other considerations: 1) The rhyme definitely points to people: in the Oxford Dic tionary of Nursery Rhymes, I. and P. Opie (1955) point out that the verse becomes intelligible if it describes human beings who are personating eggs; E. G. Withycombe (1977) in the Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names, also asso ciates a human being with the name, suggesting that it echoes the pet forms of Humphrey which are Humphry and Dump. 2) In its various translations, Humpty Dumpty has become Boule Boule in France, Thille Lille in Sweden, Lille Trille in Denmark, Hillerin-Lillering in Finland, Anneba dadeli in Switzerland and, in different parts of Germany, Trille Trolle, Etje-Papepje, Wirgele-Wargele, Gigele-Gagele, RÃ¼ntzelken-PÃ¼ntzelken and HÃ¼mpelken-PÃ¼mpelken (I. and P. Opie, 1955). These names point to closely related couples of slightly different little people as would be the case in two children from the same family. In addition to the above, it is also worthy of attention that the rhyme is very old (Wm. S. Baring-Gould and Ceil Baring-Gould, 1962) and particularly famous and wide spread. We may reasonably ask whether the reason for this persistence, fame and wide acceptance may not indicate that we are dealing with some universal psychological motifs of fundamental emotional importance. Moreover, the rhyme is quite cryptic and would not be understandable without an explanation or an illustration. It is, in fact, a riddle although, as pointed out in the Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, few people today would think of it as such. The interpretation of this riddle, of course, is that</page><page sequence="9">Humpty Dumpty 43 Humpty Dumpty is an egg. As such, it is similar to other riddles dealing with eggs one of which (mentioned in The Annotated Mother Goose) is the following: As I was walking in a field of wheat I picked up something good to eat. Neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor bone I kept it till it ran alone. This riddle-like character of the rhyme and the interest of nursery rhymes in eggs fit very well with the enigmatic character that the process of generation has in a child's mind and with the atmosphere of secrecy that so often sur rounds it. This motif is hinted at in my patient's "military secrets." In this case, the themes of sibling rivalry and curiosity about pregnancy became, naturally enough, intertwined with the all-important problems of object relations and narcissistic disturbances. The perfectly smooth surface of the intact egg is a most fitting metaphor for the total perfection of an undisturbed narcissistic condition, both that of the unchal lenged firstborn, and, by extension, of narcissistic states in general. Hence, it does not seem farfetched to suppose that, beyond the expression of sibling rivalry and of aggressive and masochistic childhood fantasies, the rhyme may also hark back to a number of general themes which deal with some essential concerns of young children which involve early destructive and irreparable narcissistic hurts and that it represents a vast array of disturbing thoughts and fanta sies, distresses, traumata, anxieties and frustrations of early childhood. It is in keeping with this view that The Annotated Mother Goose, in connection with this rhyme, presents two pictures: One depicts the classic anthropomorphic egg with a terror ized face in the act of falling while the other is a startling and seemingly inexplicable drawing by K. Greenaway which depicts a child about three or four years old sitting on a very high wall with the legs hanging down, looking into space with a pensive, forelorn and sad facial expression. Underneath are printed the first two lines of the rhyme:</page><page sequence="10">44 Renato J. Almansi Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. At this point, one may well wish to look a little further for other possible implications and roots of this old rhyme. One may reasonably wonder whether Humpty Dumpty's tale may not represent a screen for a well-concealed uncon scious birth fantasy (and, more specifically, a fantasy about birth which ends in disaster), whether the wall on which he sat may not stand for the protection; and the utter, unalterable security of the womb and the tragic fall for the process of birth, the breakage of the large egg inside which the baby grows and the laborious descent along the birth canal. It is at this point that the irreparable happens and the almost perfect quiet of the womb is suddenly lost, never to be recaptured. One is reminded here of C. BÃ¼hler's (1930) statement that "the sensitive and helpless bodies of newborn children en counter decidedly more situations from which to flee than to seek and probably also encounter much more displeasure than pleasure." Needless to say, these very early situations are merely the first in a long series of frustrating and uncomfort able life occurrences. We know absolutely nothing about the beginning of the rhyme and, therefore, we can say nothing about the psycho logical motivations of its author. But, if the hypothesis I just mentioned has any merit, it will go a long way towards explaining something which our familiarity with the rhyme has almost made us overlook: What is the meaning of an egg which is, at the same time a person? Why should it have sat on a wall and then fallen and what is the meaning and sense of it all? At this juncture, it may be worth examining the analytic literature to note the most frequent factors which may par ticipate in the formation and elaboration of birth fantasies. One element which may be present in some cases, as we have seen, is the curiosity of children about sexual matters in general and, especially, about the mysteries of birth. This is obviously a factor which stems from progressive ego ten</page><page sequence="11">Humpty Dumpty 45 dencies and from the human need to understand the un known. In and of themselves, these speculations do not rep resent birth fantasies in the proper sense of the word. Rosen (1960) has pointed out that ideas about the mecha nisms of birth may merely represent the child's sexual curi osity, concepts which are arrived at with the child's own methods and means of observation concerning anatomy and physiology which are the best available to the child at a certain level of experience, ego maturation and drive or ganization. Subsequently, they may become the point of de parture for further elaboration of more complex ideas, day dreams and fantasies. Fantasies of birth and rebirth often express the inner need for self-improvement and self-regeneration. A refu gee from Hitler's Germany, a man greatly burdened with anxieties and feelings of guilt, started his analysis, as soon as he laid down for the first time on the couch by saying that coming for this session he had been thinking of how impor tant the month of October was in his life: he had been born in October, had arrived in this country in October and now, in October, he was starting his analysis! Birth fantasies may also be impelled by the transference as in the cases described by Rose (1962-1969) in which fantasies about birth manifested by dreams and other pro ductions made their appearance about nine months after the beginning of analysis. In these patients, the birth fanta sies were clearly an outgrowth of fantasies of impregnation by the analyst. Another theme often found in the literature is the need to undo through the process of being born passive fantasies and the regressive longing for the safety of the womb, as in a claustrophobic patient described by Lewin (1935). The dangers of finding oneself helpless in a close enclave and the need to escape from it are illustrated by a case de scribed by Lowenstein (1949) in which childhood dreams that clearly centered on birth followed a severe trauma suffered at the age of four when the patient had to escape from his apart ment in the course of a fire in which many people died. Dur ing the analysis, this trauma and the corresponding birth fan tasy were rekindled when the patient nearly drowned in a</page><page sequence="12">46 Renato J. Almansi canoe accident. Claustrophobic themes were also echoed in a paper by Glauber (1955) on agoraphilia. Obviously these are only some of the many psychologi cal mechanisms which may be operative in the formation of birth fantasies. Psychological mechanisms represent their essential and indispensible ingredient, as they give them their motivation and content and are the core of birth fan tasies, as they are of fantasies in general. Any other factor which may be involved can participate only in an subsidiary and subordinate way. With this clearly in mind, and only for the purpose of exploring an intriguing hypothesis, I feel tempted to specu late about the possibility that what we may call the Humpty Dumpty birth fantasy may not be exclusively the result of psychological factors operating at some advanced period of life; and whether vague, inchoate, somatic memory traces of the birth process and of other traumatic perinatal experi ences may not have participated in its formation. I am not, of course, referring to Rank's simplistic views regarding the trauma of birth, but rather to Greenacre's much more so phisticated work in "The Predisposition to Anxiety" (1941) and especially in "The Biological Economy of Birth" (1945). In the second paper, discussing the possible relationship between particularly severe cases of birth trauma and later pathological developments, especially intense, free floating, unanalizable anxiety, she states: "I conceive of a situation in which the antenatal, natal and neonatal experiences have very slight or no true (differentiated) psychological content at the time of their occurrence, but do nevertheless leave some individual and unique somatic memory traces which amalgamate with later experiences and may thereby in crease later psychological pressures." These are memory traces altogether without visual or much psychic content which "may indeed be the stuff of which blind, free-float ing, unanalizable anxiety is constituted". In the same paper, Greenacre emphasizes the "espe cially strong stimulation of the head" which, under espe cially severe birth conditions, may cause gross damage.</page><page sequence="13">Humpty Dumpty 47 Also, in her analytic experience, she was able to study "cer tain types of head sensations or headaches which occur in states of marked anxiety" and writes: "In my experience the type of head sensation may often be correlated quite defi nitely with the form of birth experience of the individual and appears under any conditions of very severe anxiety, but especially in later life situations in which the subject of birth is being disturbed in the unconscious of the patient." In another part of the same paper, she states: "It appears that certain types of head sensations or headaches occurring in states of chronic or severe anxiety later in life may be determined by the sensory patterns set up during birth and integrated at a thalamic level either with or without projec tions into the cortex." She also correlates such observations to Bak's (1939) study which raises the question of a possible connection between the disturbed thermal orientation of some schizophrenics and the too sudden cooling of the baby immediately after delivery. Jones (1938) made hints along the same lines in his paper "Cold, Disease and Birth." The possibility of recovering by analytical means such very early memory traces is affirmed by Greenacre who states: "In a number of cases I have been able to recover sufficient material from adult dreams and from interpreta tion of adult symptoms to give some idea of the special birth experiences of the given individual, and in a few cases in which it has been possible to check against objective birth records, subsequently obtained, my reconstructions have sometimes proved rather surprisingly correct." Similarly, in a personal communication (1984), she mentions that in a number of adults who had suffered early illnesses with se vere pain, and particularly mastoiditis (before the advent of antibiotics), there was susceptibility to sudden outbursts of rage with seemingly little provocation which could be traced back in analysis to the early difficulty. In her papers, Greenacre expresses the need for fur ther systematic studies on this matter and points out the highly composite nature of the material which represents a fusion of constitutional elements, birth experiences, trau mata of the first year of life and later events which tend to coalesce and conceal the earliest components.</page><page sequence="14">48 Renato J. Almansi In a subsequent paper (1967), she reiterated that patho logical developments may only occur under circumstances of extreme severity or prolongation of the birth process and that "at any rate, all this occurs predominately at a physio logical rather than a psychological level, and contributes only in this substrated way to later psychological reactions." Greenacre's observations are not entirely isolated: Chadwick (1928) made suggestions regarding the connec tions between the birth experience and forms of headache, although he did not report much clinical material. Felix Deutsch (1933) wrote that out of seven cases of asthma he had observed, four had narrowly escaped asphyxia during the process of birth and in these patients the anxiety level during the paroxisms of asthma was exceptionally severe. Finally, in 1961, Benjamin, reported that his observations of infants were "entirely compatible with, though not posi tively supportive of Greenacre's proposition that the birth experience is one of several factors responsible for or, at least, associated with a variable predisposition to anxiety." Taking all of the above into consideration, we may conjec ture that the old rhyme of Humpty Dumpty might, to some extent, be the product of an original nucleus of somatic mem ory traces of some particularly difficult delivery, and that later on fantasies regarding birth and the birth process grounded on some of the psychological mechanisms with which we are familiar became engrafted and amalgamated with them. Again, I wish to emphasize that I am fully aware of the highly speculative character of this hypothesis. As Green acre herself emphasizes, much more work is needed on this subject. At the present time we can only conjecture and hypothesize. The precise purpose of this paper is to call attention to a set of propositions which are still pending, which may have significant implication in the field of psychosomatic medicine and which certainly deserve further extensive broad-based investigation.
