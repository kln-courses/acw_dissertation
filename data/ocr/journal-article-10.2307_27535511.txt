<plain_text><page sequence="1">by Helen Watts TLstrich JESTING PILATE TELLS THE ANSWER Aldous Huxley NOT all writers are worth criticizing. Aldous Huxley is, often. And his recent companion books, Eyeless in Gaza and Ends and Means, (1937)* in particular, deserve thoughtful criticism because in them he presents a philosophy and an ethics for us to take most seriously and, if we can, make good use of. When Huxley comes to us with two books that actually offer a "new" way of thought and life?offer for our practical acceptance a cosmology and ethics as well as a number of specific suggestions for individual and social behavior?he finds us willing to be con vinced. Our immediate reaction is that if Aldous Huxley has found a philosophy which he feels he can honestly accept and believe in, we can depend upon it that that philosophy has been critically examined by a mind as open to doubt as that of the most doubting among us. When Jesting Pilate says he has found the answer, we sit up and take notice. But has he? He has tried and is trying strenuously. That answer, however, must be not only a philosophy that he can accept but also one that will bear good fruits?one that will act both as an end for, and a means to, the good means of individual and social behavior. For he wants earnestly, the world being threatened with disaster, to save us both immediately and permanently, and he feels along with many of us that we shall never be saved on any superficial basis, but only by some fundamental change in our points of view and consequent actions. We must be con verted, in other words, to a "new life". So Huxley, himself, has set the example. He was probably converted first to a new point of view and then, being Huxley, to a new philosophy, or at least the need for *Both books published by Harper &amp; Bros., N. Y.</page><page sequence="2">64_by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH a new philosophy to support the new point of view. Here is the story of Aldous Huxley's conversion as he told it.1 . . .he himself had chosen to regard the whole process as either pointless or a practical joke. Yes, chosen. For it had been an act of the will. . . And now at last it was clear, now by some kind of immediate experience he knew that the point was in the paradox, in the fact that unity was the beginning and unity the end, and that in the meantime the condition of life and all existence was separation, which was equivalent to to evil. Huxley has had, then, a revelation. Of course one cannot speak for him and say either that he had a mystical experience and was persuaded by it, or that he felt the social and intellectual necessity to be persuaded by a mystical experience and therefore prepared himself to have one. We know only that as Huxley went about it the right mystical experience could be used to support his new philosophy and thus help produce the desired results, and that his own "immediate experience" was of the "truth" that would fit most logically into the cosmology that would correlate most logical ly with the "ethic" that should most logically produce better conditions on this earth. Huxley saw that the world was out of joint?that the social and economic systems stood in dire need of reform. He was convinced that "desirable social changes can be brought about most effectively by changing the individuals who compose society." But the individuals need a good system of ethics and some forceful persuasion to follow it. It seemed to him, therefore, that any system of ethics must rest on a cosmology. He was able to formulate a cosmology which he could correlate with the kind of ethics he felt were necessary to the good individual and social life. He supported this cosmology with evidence chosen from the discoveries of modern science and the mystical experience of him self and others. *In one of Anthony's meditations in Eyeless in Gaza, p. 470. In his medita tions and diary, at least, I believe, as do the reviewers, that Anthony may be identified with Huxley, especially in view of the repetition and development in Ends and Means of ideas expressed by Anthony.</page><page sequence="3">JESTING PILATE 65 This is the house that Huxley built. Is it a good structure and how firm are its foundations ? II Huxley must have despaired of our ever evolving an ethics which we could accept for its own sake. Or perhaps from his own tem perament he inferred a psychological necessity for a cosmological basis to ethics. He may have arrived at a conclusion somewhat as follows: what we want and need is general human happiness (and what we have is becoming in greater and greater jeopardy); that is the reason for any ethics?that is the end. (Social or economic reform, indeed, as an end in itself, can be a positive evil, producing anything but human happiness.) Most of the best authorities agree that the greatest happiness possible to man is freedom or non-attachment "to self and to. . /the things of this world' " and that implies attachment to an ideal beyond and above every other reality and concept. If I can discover such an ideal, present it to the world and get people to accept it, we shall have a real working basis for reform, as well as the only sort of end worth reforming for. Huxley chose for this ideal a cosmology, probably because a cosmology is likelier to produce good means than an ideal such as nationalism or imperialism (for which men have also lived) and because it can logically be accepted more universally. All peoples?"Aryan", Jew, and Japanese?can accept the same cosmological ideal, as the spread of Christianity has shown. "Every cosmology has its correlated ethic." The cosmology attachment to which would make us free men should, preferably, involve an "ethic" itself conducive to greater freedom and non attachment, especially since "the means employed determine the nature of the ends produced". Simply, the fundamental idea of Huxley's cosmology is that the world is unity, though its manifestations are in a diversity of forms. The "ethic" which he has been able to correlate with that cosmology "has, as its fundamental principles, these pro positions: Good is that which makes for unity; Evil is that which makes for separateness. . .Separateness is attachment and without non-attachment, no individual can achieve unity either with God,</page><page sequence="4">66 by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH or, through God, with other individuals." (Ends and Means, P- 350 If the essential nature of the world is unity, it follows, he assumes, that unity is "good" and separation is "evil", even though the implication of such reasoning is certainly that most of existence as we are ordinarily conscious of it must be "evil". Separation, diversity?conditions of our existence. . .But separation is evil. Evil, then, is the condition of life. . .(Eye less in Gaza, p 469). Assuming that unity is good, we find that the major virtues which make for goodness would also help produce a "free and just society fit for non-attached men and women to be members of and such, at the same time, as only non-attached men and women could organize." Those virtues are charity, intelligence and awareness. One must be aware, of course, in order to keep in touch with the spiritual ideal to which he forms his attachment and to comprehend the cosmology on which the ethics are based. Intelligence is necessary as a guide to charity and the minor vir tues. And charity would be the most logical means to greater unity among people. Ill The word charity Huxley uses in its biblical sense of love? love for its own sake and not for the sake of any of the various selfish satisfactions it may give us; those, for instance, of power and possession. Such disinterested love would clearly be a means to both non-attachment and unity with other individuals. Most of us know one or two people of an older generation who seem to possess that kind of charity. They are gentle, thoughtful, and forbearing folk, infinitely trustworthy. For them, charity, with its accompanying serenity and tolerance, has its roots in a deep religious faith. Christianity has not inevi ably, nor even very often, blessed its adherents with this virtue, but Huxley seems to be seeking a new religion or philosophy that will have implicit in its acceptance the practice of a very similar charity?one that will have, as that rare Christian charity has, its roots in awareness and other-worldliness. And he feels that a general rebirth of such love can come only along with a new spiritual foundation?that</page><page sequence="5">JESTING PILATE 67 we, too, need a sort of spiritual point of reference to keep always some place in our consciousness, against which to check Our behavior. Natural human perversity, moreover?all man's apparently innate bent towards animosity and separateness?if it can be changed at all (and others than Huxley have worked on the principle that in part, at least, it can) need the strongest persua sion to do the trick. How well Huxley knows this he shows by precept and example. That which besets me [Anthony confesses in Eyeless in Gaza] is indifference. I can't be bothered about people. Or rather I won't. . .the non-job of personal relations. . .is disagreeable and laborious. . .The problem is: how to love. . .How to feel a persistent affectionate interest in people? . . . Not easy to answer. And even after Eyeless in Gaza Huxley published an essay on the symbol of peace ("The Olive Tree", The Olive Tree) which con tains this sentence: "All that was greasy possessed for the Jews a profound religious, social and sensuous significance." That is hardly the expression of a charitable, non-attached man, though no doubt Huxley's only real attachment here is the irresistible, but rather dangerous one to the clever sentence. So it may have been partly Huxley's own difficulties in becoming un-separate and loving that impressed upon him the need for the strongest persuasion to goodness, and the strongest persuasion he could conceive of was a cosmological one. "Charity," he writes, "cannot progress towards universality unless the prevailing cosmo logy is either monotheistic or pantheistic?unless there is a general belief that all men are 'the sons of God'. [We cannot love each other as brothers unless we consider ourselves brothers by an important sire]." In a book that tries to formulate a practical ethics for intelligent people,2 such a statement is danger ous for two reasons: (i) Not all of us can see the logical necessity of such a cosmology to such an ethics. (2) The cosmology itself is laid open to the suspicion that it has been wishfully conceived 2And it is to them that Huxley, whether he will or no, is making his appeal. His "religion" is a highly intellectualized and de-emotionalized one that can never successfully pass directly to the unintelligent or even to the untrained. That is why it must be intellectually examinable.</page><page sequence="6">68 by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH and may, therefore, be partially invalid. We shall return to that suspicion in our examination of the foundations on which Huxley built his cosmology. Some of us can hardly see the necessity of such a cosmology, or any cosmology, to such ethics since there have always been a few truly charitable agnostics in the world, as well as a few charitable pantheists, Christians, and Mohammedans. Moreover, we could not all accept the cosmology even if we were convinced of its pragmatic value to ethics which we could accept wholeheartedly. It may be that our knowledge and intelligence are not sufficient to formulate logically and deliberately an ethics that every one could take to heart and mind. But when and if such a system of ethics is formulated, some of us?unless there is some new and most wonderful revelation which appeals to us beyond any doubting?are still going to insist upon its being acceptable for its own sake and not for that of any cosmology with which it may be correlated. Until we can, not wishfully, but rather against skepti cal resistance, be converted to a "new" cosmology, our ethics, if it is to be correlated with anything, must remain correlated with our own free man's agnosticism. And the nearest we can come to a sense of universal brotherhood is to that which comes of "life lived". We are brothers, if at all, because we are experiencing life contem poraneously and in the same form, but it takes the artist to make us aware even of that apparent kinship, and not everyone has the imagination to understand and assimilate an artistic expression. IV Awareness, not only of what goes on about us, but a sort of mystical awareness of what lies beyond our immediate sensual experience, is one of Huxley's most important ends as well as a good means. As we have seen, awareness or insight is the end to achieve which man must be good, and it is a "means whereby" he can become non-attached. Since each man's few years of existence on earth as a human being may well be his only chance of being consciously aware of anything much beyond his own physiological needs?his only chance to be curious and explore with his imagination and intellect not only what he senses but what he wonders about?Huxley feels that not only should the individual make every effort to be aware</page><page sequence="7">JESTING PILATE 69 to the extent of his capacity, but that men should work together to give as many as possible the best opportunities to be aware. They should remove all the distractions they can?all the oppor tunities to become attached to one thing or another and so only partially aware. That is an end to which every sensitive, wonder ing human being must agree, whether his own perception may run in just the direction Huxley indicates, or not. V Huxley felt that he should change his old philosophy of meaning lessness, we know, to one that would bear the good fruits of an im proved ethics. He wanted his new philosophy, morever, to have a sound and convincing basis, so he chose for his supports the evidence of our modern authority?science?and of the ancient authority, the mystical experience.3 How he makes use of science we shall see later. As a matter of fact, he makes the effort to put much of the mystical experience into terms of this contemporarily accepted authority, comparing, for instance, the training of the mystic with that of the scientist. (See Ends and Means, p. 342) Huxley is convinced that the mystical experience not only can, but frequently must, be trained for. He emphasizes also the im portant part the will plays in having a mystical experience and the choice one can make of being or not being aware. The sub-personal existence can be terminated at will. Any body who so desires and knows how. . . can pass. . . to a super-personal level. This super-personal level is reached only during the mystical experience. (Ends and Means, p. 376.)3 What persuaded Huxley to this "pragmatic" point of view? For 3As Huxley pointed out in his essay on propaganda in The Olive Tree, every age has at least one accepted authority. Ours, evidently, is science and empiric ism. Now, in a sense, mysticism is simply the epitome of empiricism?the mystical experience is certainly much more a personal experiment than a deduction?and it is on the personal mystical experience of himself and others and on the latest scientific investigation that Huxley has based his cosmology. Fortunately, as he sees it, they complement each other and together form the authority for the most logical end to good means. "Scientific investigation" [he writes, Ends and Means, p. 348] " has shown that the world is a diversity underlain by an identity of physical substance; the mystical experience testifies to the existence of a spiritual unity underlying the diversity of separate consciousness." 3See also quotation on p. 64.</page><page sequence="8">70_by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH one thing, of course, it was necessary to his plan of reform. The Church and certain philosophers, moreover, would have supported him in it. But in particular, it was probably the influence of the man on whom he modeled Dr. Miller in Eyeless in Gaza that per suaded Huxley that he could "consciously control" his philosophy even, perhaps, to the point of directing his immediate perceptions towards the most propitious truth. VI There is not much doubt that for the majority of its American readers the character of Dr. Miller has seriously cheapened Eyeless in Gaza. We are either suspicious of him or we despise the man outright?he is too exaggerated in both ideas and manner. At worst, however, we have probably considered him an unfortunate spokesman for some of Huxley's less convincing ideas, rather than a character based directly on a man who not only holds many of those ideas himself but may have been largely responsible for them in Huxley. Huxley, as a matter of fact, effectively, if not deliber ately, throws us off the scent by making Dr. Miller an admitted disciple of his model, F. M. Alexander. F. Matthias Alexander was, apparently, an intelligent young man who applied himself even in his youth, won scholarships, taught school, was in the army, etc. He turned to reciting, finally, as a calling, until he was afflicted with a serious throat ailment which he eventually cured by his own methods. Naturally he was enthusiastic, and from those methods he evolved a system of physical education and treatment for the sick which not only some schools but certain doctors in England have sponsored. This system seems to have as its chief end a good general co-ordina tion, to be attained by means which, according to both teacher and pupils, cannot be understood by the uninitiate or practised without the aid of a "teacher". Alexander has, apparently, a considerable practice in which he is successful. Indeed, no one, I think, would deny the benefits? both physical and psychological?to be derived from improved bodily co-ordination. And since Huxley recommends him from "personal experience" he must feel that he responded favorably to</page><page sequence="9">JESTING PILATE_71 Alexander's treatment. To men like Huxley, moreover, Alexander offers more than physical improvement; he offers intriguing ideas and theories, as well. In Man's Supreme Inheritance, Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual and The Use of Self, Alexander has presented, among others, some very good ideas. They strike one as intelli gent and sound and are not, of course, entirely original with him. Huxley must have found them variously expressed in a number of his other sources, so that one wonders all the more why in Eyeless in Gaza he put the expression and championship of these ideas back into the mouth of a character who must have been modeled on Alexander?Dr. Miller. And one asks, too, what sort of mistaken honesty compelled him to take so much of the cheap along with the valuable from this particular source. Many of Alexander's theories run in the same direction as Hux ley's own wishful thinkings?that man can do more and more for himself e en to directing the course of his evolution.5 And Alexander presents one general theory that was particularly bound to appeal to Huxley.8 Man, he points out, cannot be separated into mind and body; mind and body are too interdependent. And right now man is in a bad way "psycljo-physically" because he has evolved too rapidly for himself and is at an uncomfortable stage where he cannot trust his "subconscious control" and does not know how to assume full "conscious control". The remedy is not to turn back to more primitive conditions to improve his co-ordination, but to use his intelligence and "consciously control" his co-ordination under his immediate environment. That general theory, has of course, several correlated ones, as well as any num ber of practical suggestions accompanying it?a whole system of practice, in fact, as we have seen. *See Ends and Means, p. 258. 5"The suggested adoption of conscious guidance and control as a universal principle on the lines heretofore outlined will enable us to move slowly but with gradually increasing speed towards those higher psycho-physical spheres which will separate the animal and human kingdoms by a deep gulf, and mankind will then enjoy the blessings which will be the natural result of capacities fully developed." {Man's Supreme Inheritance, p. 192. See also pp. 4-5.) 6As well as, incidentally, to John Dewey, who has written prefaces to Alex ander's books. 7See ch. 2 of Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual on "Comparison of Evolutionary Processes in the Savage and Civilized States".</page><page sequence="10">72_by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH Alexander claims that not only physical improvement can be gained by his methods, but also mental, moral and eventually social. In fact, "there is no sphere of human activity, of human feeling or philosophy where the adoption of the principles of con scious guidance and control would not bring invaluable benefits." And Huxley, too, seems persuaded that this is so. Since the whole purpose of this article is not to establish the identity of Dr. Miller and disclose one of the more unfortunate sources of Huxley's ideology, it would only over-emphasize the importance of Alexander to give all the evidence here. Anyone who cares to look into Alexander's books will find it conspicuous on their pages; and, for the more trusting, perhaps an example or two will suffice, not only to establish Alexander as an important source but also to show traces of that unsoundness and exaggera tion which we distrusted in Dr. Miller and which Alexander car ries to the usual epitome of quackery?a painless cure for cancer.8 Alexander, because he is describing such "new" sensations, finds it necessary to construct a rather particular, but well re-iterated jargon of his own. This consists not so much of single words as of phrases such as "the proper mental attitude", "the position of mechanical advantage", "sensory appreciation", "conscious inhibi tion", " re-education", "end gaining", "means whereby", etc. Hux ley has added some of these catch-phrases to his own vocabulary where they stand rather out of place among his other sufficient and well chosen words. Huxley gives a concise summary of the better part of Alexander's ideas in Anthony's diary for June 3, 1934,9 and several page-refer ences could be made to Alexander's books for nearly every line of the entry. Some of his vocabulary is here as well as indications of a number of ideas that Huxley pursues in End and Means. So a rather full quotation from that entry seems justified. At today's lesson with Miller10 found myself suddenly a step forward in my grasp of the theory and practice of the tech nique. To learn proper use one must first inhibit all improper uses of the self ["the correct order of procedure for teacher 8See Man's Supreme Inheritance, pp. 47, 86, 183, and 288. 9Eyeless in Gaza, pp. 248-250. There is also a summary and exposition of Alexander's ideas in Ends and Means, pp. 254-259. 10This passage identifies Miller with Alexander as finally as any character can be identified with his model.</page><page sequence="11">JESTING PILATE 73 and pupil is first for the pupil to learn to prevent himself from doing the wrong things," Man's Supreme Inheritance, p. 210]. Refuse to be hurried into gaining ends by the equi valent (in personal, psychological terms) of violent revolution [the violent revolution that no end can justify, in Ends and Means']', inhibit this tendency, concentrate on the means whereby the end is to be achieved; then act ["It is not the 'end' that the teacher and pupil must work for, but the 'means whereby'," Man's Supreme Inheritance, p. 230]. This process entails knowing good and bad use?knowing them apart. By the "feel" ["Sensory appreciation"?". . .when a person sits down or stands up in accordance with the demands of con structive conscious control, the process involves an adequate and continuous state of increasing awareness in regard to the use of the mechanisms, so that immediately there is a wrong use of these mechanisms, the person concerned becomes aware of it, and at once substitutes a satisfactory for the unsatisfac tory use," Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual, p. 306]. Increased awareness and the increased power of control result. [Awareness?Alexander, we see, uses the word in this sense, too, and then on a different level in Ends and Means it becomes at once a very important end and a means? one of the major virtues, in fact. But awareness on this first level, as well as a hint of its continuation on other levels to the final one of mysticism, Huxley first learns from Alexander; as Anthony does from Dr. Miller]. . . .Here. . .one is taught how to become aware. And not only that. Also how to per form rightly, instead of wrongly, the activities of which there is awareness. [Alexander teaches people how to sit, walk, talk, etc., just as Dr. Miller teaches Anthony.] Nor is this all. Awareness and power of control are transferable. Skill ac quired in getting to know the muscular aspect of mind-body can be carried over into the exploration of other aspects. ["It ('conscious control') is not used merely to indicate a guidance and control which we may apply in the activities of life with but doubtful precision in one or two directions only, but one which may be applied universally, and with precision in all directions, and in all spheres where the mental and physical manifestations of mankind are concerned," Man's Supreme Inheritance, p. 57.] On the fifth of April, Dr. Miller, having given Anthony a lesson in the "use of the self", explained that he would find it a "tech nique for translating good intentions into acts, for being sure of doing what one knows one ought to do." Huxley has always had a certain moral streak in him; he has wanted to be good, but not</page><page sequence="12">74_by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH until cently has he been at all sure just what "good" and "bad" were, if they existed as such. In Eyeless in Gaza and Ends and Means, however, he seems to have few doubts on that score. He lays all the emphasis on being able to do what one knows one should do.11 And Alexander-Miller, we see, can teach him how to do that, along with how to stand up, sit down, and bend over. So Anthony notes in his diary for June 3rd13 that the "power to cure bad behavior seems essentially similar to the power to cure bad co-ordination. One learns this last when learning the proper use of self." Huxley uses the Alexander system to help carry out his reform on two levels. On the first he directly suggests the use of Alexan der's methods to improve the conduct of the individual, and, as many individuals in the aggregate, society. In his chapter on education in Ends and Means he recommends both Alexander's books and his system of physical education for our children. In his chapter on ethics he writes,18 ... .1 have described a technique of physical training (that developed by F. M. Alexander), which is valuable, among other reasons, as a means for increasing conscious control of the body and, in this way, raising a human being from a condition of physical unawareness to a state of physical self consciousness and self-control. Such physical self-awareness and self-control leads to, and to some extent is actually a form of, mental and moral self-awareness and self-control. We have seen how important awareness is to Huxley's cosmology and ethics. Self-control is almost equally important. It would undoubtedly be, for one thing, an essential part of the training for the mystical experience. In the second place, that people can control themselves is a necessary primary assumption in any plan for social reform. Especially a plan that aims at a more reasonable and tolerant behavior which is to help forestall such disasters as war. If Alexander's methods were successful in producing that u"The staggering imbecility of old Socrates! . . imagining that one had only to know the correct line of conduct in order to follow it! One practically always knows it?and more often than not one doesn't follow it." (Eyeless in Gaza, PP. 277.) 12Eyeless in Gaza, pp. 250. ^Ends and Means, p. 377.</page><page sequence="13">JESTING PILATE 75 sort of self-control they would be worthy of greatest consideration and respect. But apparently his methods do not produce such results even in their originator. During the war of 1914-18, Alexander was no more able than the rest of the world to keep his intellectual balance. In the 1918 edition o? Man's Supreme Inheritance, the book which introduces his system for achieving self-control, he includes a most amazing and mad chapter on "Evolutionary Standards and Their Influence in the Crisis of 1914" which proffers a theory of the comparatively low state of evolution among the Germans and con tains such statements as this: Therefore, a test as to the ratio of progress of nations on the evolutionary plane is to be found in their tendency and desire to advance beyond that stage where the mental and physical forces, which should only belong as inherited instincts to the brute animals and savages, hold sway; and with this in view, if we take a survey of the history, ideals, habits of life, mental outlook, and general tendencies of the German nation, it will show conclusively that these self-hypnotised people approxi mated too closely to the lower animals and savages in their mode and chief aims of life. It seems no less than ironical that Huxley should advise methods which produce such results, in a book the purpose of which is to produce such opposite ones. On the second level, the approach is less direct. Here the Alexander system helps Huxley to formulate a philosophy to be used as a basis of reform. It helps him by getting him into shape to have the mystical experience that he uses as such a strong argument for his cosmology, and it may help him in other ways to have the right mystical experience. We have seen that Huxley has been persuaded that good be havior and awareness come as natural outgrowths of good co-ordination and sensory appreciation and that the same tech nique can be applied to controlling one's points of view and moral actions, and one's elimination. One acquires virtue if not along with, at least in much the same way that one acquires a good pos ture. And "virtue is the essential preliminary to the mystical experience." (Ends and Means, p. 347.) That virtue is a prerequisite to the mystical experience might</page><page sequence="14">76 by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH seem open to question. It did not seem to be a preliminary to the apostle Paul's mystical experience. But Huxley not only makes that assumption, he insists upon it. Another important means to the mystical experience is the practice of meditation. Meditation Huxley calls, in fact, "the technique of mysticism" and says that "properly practiced, with due preparation, physical, mental and moral, meditation may result in. . .the direct intuition of, and union with, an ultimate spiritual reality. . .u If the technique of "conscious control" can be used in "every sphere of human activity", that must include meditation. And in Eyeless in Gaza (p. 12) Huxley writes that Miller believes possible a non-theological praxis of meditation. Which he would like, of course, to couple with training, along F. M. Alexander's lines, in use of the self. Anthony proceeds to build up in his diary, from time to time, what one might assume to be sample meditations. The whole last chapter of Eyeless in Gaza, in fact, might well be read as a sample meditation, built up with such self-hypnotic aids as the repetition of single words?"unity", "one, one, one", and "peace"?to the point of mystical ecstasy, the light out of which he had to let himself lapse "slowly and cautiously. . .back through the darkness into the broken gleams and shadows of everyday existence." So we find both virtue (including awareness) and meditation, in their offices of both ends in themselves and means to the mystical experience that shall help establish our metaphysical beliefs, approached either directly or indirectly by the rather suspect Alexander way. From cancer to the mystical experience?Alexan der, with Huxley's assistance, does move in rather long strides. We have suggested that Huxley's immediate perception of the world as a unity may have come as an affirmation of what he felt the world should be if there was to be built on its nature any cosmology suitable to a good ethics. Whether or not Alexander had any influence on the direction towards which Huxley may possibly have guided his "immediate perception", it is, of course, impossible to say. But Alexander, too, wrote, long before the advent of Eyeless in Gaza, that one must conceive of the world as well as the human body as a unity. In the preface of Constructive llEnds and Means, p. 332.</page><page sequence="15">JESTING PILATE 77 Conscious Control of the Individual (p. xi) he disparages the theories "which tend in practical application towards the separa tion instead of the unity of human potentialities" and says that his own thesis provides principles which are fundamental to that condition of unity which we all agree should be inseparable from the processes of living. The subject matter of this book [he adds] represents an endeavor to show that the great problems involved in the present condition of individual and national unrest demand for their solution a recognition, not only of their unity, but also of the unity of their underlying causes. Finally, the only conclusion which it seems possible to draw is that the use of Alexander has weakened Huxley's argument both in specific cases, as we have seen, and in general, since we find him capable of accepting an untrustworthy authority. VII The other important foundation on which Huxley builds his "scientific-mystical conception of the world" is, of course, science. Here again, Huxley seems only too willing to turn from the tenta tive to the implication, at any rate, of the positive, and he is, furthermore, inclined to speak of one thing in terms of another. Contemporary science seems to admit quite frankly that its dis coveries are for the most part tentative, and Huxley hardly claims that they do more than indicate. But he uses the orator's neat trick of frankly admitting the weakness of his primary assump tions and then proceeding, nevertheless, to use them as a working basis. He introduces every branch of science to make his points, though his main argument is based on biology and physics. He argues, in substance, that as far as they go they support his mystical idea of nature and when they do not support it, either they do not go far enough u or those who argue from the scientific point of view and 15"No account of the scientific picture of the world and its history would be complete unless it contained a reminder of the fact frequently forgotten by scientists themselves, that the picture does not even claim to be comprehensive." (Ends and Means, p. 308.)</page><page sequence="16">78 by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH who do not find at least meaning in the world, are prejudiced by their own selfish desires.16 The biological sciences offer Huxley proof that pragmatically, at any rate, it is better to be "good" than separate and evil. Biological specialization may be regarded as a tendency on the part of a species to insist on its separateness; and the result of specialization. . .is either negatively disastrous, in the sense that it precludes the possibility of further biological progress, or positively disastrous in the sense that it leads to the extinction of the species. In the same way intro-specific competition may be regarded as the expression of a tendency on the part of related individuals to insist on their separateness and independence; the effects of intra-specific competition are . . . almost wholly bad. Conversely, the qualities which have led to biological progress are the qualities which make it pos sible for individual beings to escape from their separateness? intelligence and the tendency to co-operate. Love and under standing are valuable even on the biological level. Hatred, unawareness, stupidity and all that makes for increase of separateness. . .have led either to the extinction of a species, or to its becoming a living fossil, incapable of making further biological progress. (Ends and Means, p. 350.) A large grain of obvious truth lies in that paragraph, but isn't Huxley unjustifiably speaking at once in terms of both biological functioning and social relations? And he has, of course, overlooked several facts of biology, such as the one that co-operation among animals often leads to speciali zation?intense and weakening specialization, at that, such as you find among bees. The drone bee, for example, has specialized in being nothing but a male to the extent that he is useless for any purpose but reproduction and very few drones ever perform even that function. Professor J. H. Bradley points out this disadvantage in co-operation in his excellent article, "Co-operation in Nature" in the Yale Review, (Summer 1938)?an article which Huxley would do well to read. In it Professor Bradley concludes that 16"Those who detect no meaning in the world generally do so because, for one reason or another, it suits their books that the world should Ibe meaningless." {Ends and Means, p. 312.) Any philosopher who has that attitude "is not con cerned exclusively with a problem in pure metaphysics. He is also concerned to prove that there is no valid reason why he personally should not do as he wants to do, or why his friends should not seize political power and govern in the way that they find most advantageous to themselves." (Ends and Means, p. 315.)</page><page sequence="17">JESTING PILATE 79 co-operation probably has more advantages for the "lower" animals than non-co-operation, but he writes also that "as a matter of observable fact, co-operation is not invariably perfect as a way of life because nature is not invariably perfect as an economist." "Love and understanding," Huxley states, "are valuable even on the biological level." Well, perhaps, though not in quite the anthropomorphic sense which he implies, but it is probably even more true that all life depends on the destruction of other life. Any individual, in order to exist, must be separate and destructive for the very "condition of life is separation". "But separation is evil." Why the very real condition of separa tion is evil while underlying unity is good, even Huxley does not attempt to explain. He doesn't seem to consider an explanation necessary. He admits?he points out?that separation is a condi tion of our very existence and that there is no way to get around the fact, but he never seems to consider that in the natural order of things the "condition" may be no more evil than the "essential", or underlying, nature. In his "scientific-mystical" cosmology, Huxley has been able to make most use of the investigation of the physical sciences into the nature of matter. Scientific investigation reveals, [he finds], (and these find ings. . .are confirmed by the direct intuition of the trained mystic and contemplative) that concrete reality consists of a totality and that independent existents are merely abstrac tions from the reality. (Ends and Means, p. 295). All matter, according to the physicist, is built up, in a limited number of patterns, out of units of energy which, in isolation, seem to possess none of the qualities ordinarily associated with matter in the mass. [In other words], the material universe is pictured by science as composed of a diversity of patterns of a single substance. (Ends and Means, p. 292-3.) Huxley felt he had the verdict of science to support him, then, in his meditations on essential unity and conditional separateness. What Thomas Huxley would have thought of all this one hesitates to imagine, but it does not take much scientific training to discover that here Aldous has lapsed from straight-forward think ing. It is possible that eventually a new religion may grow up based on both mystical perception and the discoveries of modern science ?a pantheism, perhaps, of which the apologies will be made in</page><page sequence="18">80_by HELEN WATTS ESTRICH laboratories. And from that religion may spring a powerful ethics of forbearance and brotherly love, but that ethics would seem more apt to come as a natural outgrowth of a greater "scientific" under standing of human nature and of a rebirth of awareness of exis ence as a whole, than as based on an intellectual analogy with the sub-atomic structure of matter. Especially if the analogy is no more sound than Huxley's. Moreover, while Huxley might simply have used the implications of scientific research cautiously to help substantiate his mystical concept of the universe, or even as a symbol for a way of life, instead he insists upon them as supporting his ethics not only indirectly, as evidence for his cosmology, but directly, as factual reality that defines the directions of moral good and evil. It hardly seems too facetious even to point out here that not many people are going to love their neighbors because they know that electrons and protons are both electric in nature, any more than they will continue to fight their neighbors merely because they know also that electrons and protons not only attract, but repel each other. Huxley's analogy, in other words, is a poor if not absolutely false one, and even though it were excellent the fact would still remain that not many people have ever guided their actions by such remote considerations. A few have always been charitable because they believed in charity as an ideal or because of their natural temperament. Others have been good because they believed in some concept which touched them directly, such as heaven or hell. And probably even more have been decent in their relations with their fellow-beings because they realized, at least half-consciously, the mutual benefit to be derived from good behavior. Any intellectual or imaginative concept must be convinc ing first of all to concern people at all, and to concern most people it must have something to do with their "conditional" existence. VIII Huxley's structure, then, does not stand up any too well under close examination. Its weakness lies perhaps chiefly in method, and that may be due largely to the fact that he learned too much of his method at the feet of F. M. Alexander, who is not wholly trust</page><page sequence="19">JESTING PILATE 81 worthy. Huxley's system of ethics is not inevitably, nor always well, correlated with his cosmology and his two most important arguments for that cosmology have suffered in handling. Science, he interprets too freely, too anthropomorphically, and not very scientifically; and his own mystical experience he manages to present, at least, as tainted with pragmatism. Huxley might simply have offered for our consideration an ethics for its own sake?an ethics that would have been both the end and the means. Or he might have shown how a greater spiritual awareness might help us to be less concerned with our own immediate interests and therefore more tolerant, charitable people to live together. Instead, he has based his ethics on a cosmology which he uses also as both an analogy and a reason for good behavior, and which, as he presents it, does not seem very sound. His suggestion of the possibility of other, more ultimate ends than the merely pragmatic is good?it lies, on the whole, in the direction of complete open-mindedness, and it recalls our attention to certain points of view which we are all too inclined to neglect. That is why it is so unfortunate that the particular cosmological end which he finally lays before us fails to stand up firmly under our examination. We must, of course, consider Eyeless in Gaza and Ends and Means as presenting a tentative and incomplete ideology. Huxley may well be started in the right direction, but if he is not to shake our faith in his intellectual integrity to the point where he can no longer render us that service which has depended upon that faith, he must be more wary of convictions that tend to interfere with his objectivity and of teachers with intriguing theories and magnetic personalities. He must, that is, preserve his open-mindedness and maintain his disinterested approach. 6</page></plain_text>
