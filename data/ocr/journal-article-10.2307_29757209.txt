<plain_text><page sequence="1">The First Sermon by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky The First Sermon is one of the four most important events in the life of the Buddha. It represents the first time Buddha Gautama shared his hard won knowledge with mankind. Despite its prominence, the story of First Sermon is fraught with inconsistencies and contradictions which have been largely ignored. This paper seeks to both demonstrate that it was late in evolving and to analyse its creation using the scriptural and artistic traditions. However, it is not within the scope of this paper to offer a detailed study of the theological content of the First Sermon. Unlike the sacred locale of the Bodhi tree, today's pilgrim is no longer able to identify the exact spot where the First Sermon took place. Doubt about the veracity of the legend was first raised by the venerable Foucher who questioned the considerable distance, 150 miles, between the sites of the Enlightenment, Bodh Gaya, and that of the First Sermon, the city of Benares Located near the sacred river Ganges, Benares (the modern Varanasi, the ancient K?si), was a most appropriate place for the Buddha to convert his first followers. Sanctified for centuries by religious eremitic practices, it was, since antiquity, one of the holiest cities; amidst its lushly wooded forests ascetics lived in reclusion (2). Although the Mauryan King Asoka, in his pilgrimage to the sites important in the life of the Buddha, erected a column at Benares, it is not recorded whether this was to commemorate the First Sermon, or merely one of the many places where the Buddha visited and preached. It lacks an inscribed edict like the one found at Lumbini which commemorated the place of the Buddha's birth (3). The location of the First Sermon was barely mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian in the 400 A.D. in the account of his pilgrimage to India (4) and by the time that Xuan Zang visited it in the 7th century, it was relatively deserted with 0) A Foucher, The Life of the Buddha, transl.

Xuan Zang described the Asokan column and a much later statue of the Buddha The story of the First Sermon appeared late in the sutras. Thomas, in his study of the life of the Buddha, pointed out that although the Pali canon ends with the First Sermon, in his opinion, it evolved considerably later (6). The earliest of the Chinese scriptures to tell the story of the life of the Buddha, the Xuxing benji jing, translated in 197, ends with the Enlightenment and excludes the First Sermon altogether (7). The Taizu ruiying benqi jing&gt; translated in the second quarter of the 3rd century, the first of the Chinese scriptures to narrate the event, treats it in a cursory and confused way (8). Both the Mahavagga of the Pali Canon and the Guoqu Xianzai Yinquo Jing translated in 420-479 (9) have an extended narrative cycle of the events of the First Sermon. Compared to the narratives of the Enlightenment, scriptural versions of the First Sermon in both the Pali Canon and the Chinese translations vary and abound in disparities. Among the anomalies is the fact that at first the Buddha had no interest in preaching, but importuned by the gods, finally acquiesced. Secondly there is a long passage describing the Buddha's consideration of who was most worthy to hear the sermon. He contemplates the various sages he encountered in his years of asceticism, and in each case he is informed by angelic voices that they are already dead. (5) Ibid., p. 45. Xuan Zang wrote of the city with thirty sangharamas and 3000 priests of the Hinay?na school, a st?pa and column erected by Asoka as well as a vih?ra or temple inside of which was a large copper statue of the Buddha in the act of Turning the Wheel to mark the spot of the First Sermon. At present the Museum of Sarnath houses an Asokan lion capital, presumably of the column described by Xuan Zang, which is now lacking both the 60 foot support and crowning element of the wheel. The capital itself is a very complex symbolic representation of time and space ? the four seasons and four directions. The statue is seated and in dharmacakramudr?. (6) E.J. Thomas, The Life of Buddha, London 1927, p. 84: the canon ends with the First Sermon, but the life story continues in Mahaparinibbanasutta. The Vinaya version he believes evolved late, p. 86, 'In other words the legend of the first sermon had not yet originated'. (7) XBJ, no. 184. (8) TRBJ, p. 480: The Buddha already [knew] Brahma was thinking about who would be the first to cross. [He thought]: "Formerly my father, the king, sent five men to wait on me, who are now in the mountains". So he returned on the road [to them]. When the five men saw the Buddha and his [changed] bodily appearance they said, "Be wary of the man who is coming [here now], Do not get up!" But when the Buddha arrived, the five men got up and although they did not feel like making obeisance [to him], they did. The Buddha said: "You [decided to] hold back your hearts, why were you not firm and certain? Saying nothing you got up. Why did you make obeisance [to me after all]?" The five men did not face him. They wanted to become monks. The Buddha then put his hand to his head, [and said] in order to be a sramana you must return to the way and sit under the tree, and each meditate on the Buddha'. (9) GXYJ, p. 643. 128 [2]</page><page sequence="3">The Guoqu Xianzai Yinquo Jing: On the seventh day the World Revered One acquiesced to Brahma's and the other gods' request [to preach]. With the vision of a Buddha he saw that the various living beings, above, on, and below the earth were in trouble. He observed those below, on, and above the earth for twenty-seven days. Then the World Revered One solemnly thought, 'I now should open the door the Law of Sweet Dew. Who should be the first to hear it? The Bhagava sages are intelligent and easy to awaken, furthermore they were the first to come forth wanting me, [after] the Way was achieved, to return'. He was thinking this when in the sky there were voices who spoke, 'The Bhagava sages died last night'. The World Honored One answered the voices in the sky saying, 'I also know they died last night'. He further thought to himself, 'The sage Kalama is fundamentally enlightened, he should be among the first to hear [the sermon]'. [The voices] in the sky said 'Kalama died last night'. The World Revered One answered, 'I also know that he died last night'. Then the World Revered One further thought to himself, 'The five men who were dispatched by the king, his advisors, and ministers all look up to me. They are intelligent and in the past informed me that they desired to (be the) first to hear the Law. I now should preach the Law to these five men'. He thought to himself, 'The place where all the Buddhas of the Past turned the Wheel of the Law was in Benares's deer park [Mrgadava park], the place where sages live, and it is also the place where the five men are living. I shall now go there to turn the great Wheel of the Law'. Solemnly thinking this, he got up from his seat and went to Benares (10). According to this and another Chinese translations, Buddha remembers the five members of the search party who were fearful of returning home without the crown prince and abandoned their mission to live as ascetics. Having decided on both a worthy audience and appropriate location, he eats a meal and proceeds to Benares. In both the Pali and Chinese scriptures many other divergences evince a belated state of the story's creation; it is clear that there were different traditions and the details were not yet fixed. First, in both scriptures Buddha, on the way to Benares, meets an ascetic, identified as an Ajivaka Jain in the Mahavagga. Buddha informs him that he has been enlightened but the Jain walks away shaking his head. Bareau, in his study of the Vinaya sources of the life of the Buddha concludes that this episode, present in all of the texts under his analysis, is a later addition (n). Its meaning is clear, not everyone is enlightened enough to appreciate the teaching. In addition, unbeknownst to the Buddha, the group of five men to whom he plans to preach have rejected him because he resumed eating and no longer practised self mortification. They agree among themselves to reject him, but when confronted with him they forget (10) GXYJ, p. 643, chap. 20. (n) A. Bareau, Recherches sur la biographie du Buddha dans les Sutrapitaka et les Vinayapitaka anciens, 3 vols., Paris 1963, vol. I, pp. 156 ff. [3] 129</page><page sequence="4">their resolution. This too Bareau deduced was a later addition to the narrative, inferring that the Buddha had no prior knowledge of these men (12). Finally, the Buddha preaches the all important Four Truths first to one man, and when he has achieved understanding of it, it is said The Wheel has been turned'. Miraculous celebrations are enjoyed throughout the universe. Then the four other disciples request him to preach and he briefly sermonizes to them. Similarly, in the Mahavagga although the Buddha preaches to all five monks, only one, Kondanna, 'obtained the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye' and was invited to join the order with the words, 'Come monk'. The four others were taught in succession: next came Vappa and Bhaddiya, after them Mahanama and Assaji (13). Then the World Revered One walked to Benares, and came to the garden in the Mahanamabhapia (14) of Kaundinya, and stopped in Prajabhatobaja. The five men saw the Buddha from afar, and said, 'Shamen Shakya, rejecting the practice of austerities, has begun to eat again. No longer is his mind set on [finding] the way. He is coming here now. Let's not trouble ourselves to welcome him or make obeisance, [but] arrange a seat [for him] to sit (with us) and to discuss his ideas'. After thus conversing, each was silent. As the World Revered One approached them, the five men forgot [their oath]. Each got up from his seat, made obeisance and welcomed him. One [offered] to hold his clothes and begging bowl, another obtained water for him to rinse his mouth, another had some for washing his feet. Each broke their promise [to ignore him]. Although they considered him Buddha, they called him Gautama. The World Honored One spoke to Kaundinya saying, 'You agreed among yourselves not to get up when you saw me. Why did you break your vow and excitedly get up [offering] to carry something for me'? The five men, hearing the Buddha's words felt deeply ashamed, came forward, and said, 'You, Gautama, have been walking on the road a long time and are undoubtedly are weary'. The World Honored One answered, 'Why do you say so? Most Highly Revered Ones have eminent feelings. My mind is empty, beyond such distinctions. But you are boastful and arrogant. You beckon evil karma on yourself. It is as if there were a son whose father and mother were renowned as the most righteous in the world, and only he was not able to [treat them so]. How much more am I, now father and mother to all?'. When the five men heard this they were ashamed, and said to the Buddha, 'We are stupid and ignorant. We did not know that you achieved nirvana. Why? Because when we last saw you, you ate only a kernel [of grain] a day, practising austerities for six years. Now you return eating with pleasure. This is why we thought you did not achieve the way'. Then the World Honored One spoke to Kaundinya saying, 'You have nothing (12) Ibid., p. 168. Bareau proposed that in the most ancient recensions the monks had no prior knowledge of the Buddha before the First Sermon (p. 170). (13) Mahavagga, I, 6, 32-37, transl. by LB. Horner, Vinaya Pitaka, The Book of Discipline (Sacred Books of the Buddhists, vol. XIV), London 1962, p. 19. (14) W.E. Soothill, A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London 1934, p. 433. 130 [4]</page><page sequence="5">but small knowledge with which to measure whether I have achieved the way or not. Why [have I begun to eat again]? When the body is in pain, the mind is confused. When the body is happy, then the condition of happiness spreads. Therefore neither pain nor pleasure are the way. It is as if [something were] on fire, if you douse the burning fire with water, inevitably there will no longer be any light to break the darkness. Intelligence bores like fire, and the water is pain and pleasure, [preventing] the rays of wisdom (from being) produced. If these rays [of wisdom] are not produced then one cannot lift the black veil of life and death. But if you can reject pain and pleasure, practice the middle path, and maintain the mind in solitary meditation, the result of such practices is entering the true path of the sage. Then you are far from the grief of birth, old age, sickness, and death. I, having followed and prospered by the middle path, have obtained complete samadhi'. Now the five men heard these words and their hearts were very happy, boundlessly joyful. They looked reverently at his face for a long while. Then the World Honored One, seeing the five men were at the point of receptivity to the way, said, 'Kaundinya know that the five sufferings derive from the skandas (15): There are the pains of birth, old age, sickness, death, being separated from a loved one, anger, and hatred. If you seek to not have pain, then you [must] cast off pain as well as happiness and glory. Kaundinya, there is a form without form. All living creatures, whether they have no feet, one, two, four or many feet, have this pain. It is as if one [tried to] put out a fire by only over-turning the ashes. If dry grass comes in contact with it, it will burn again. The various pains are made from one's own body. Even if it is but a small matter that arises in my thoughts, it still causes me pain ? coveting, desire, anger, and rage, and then I encounter doubts. All karma is produced [by] oneself. These three evils are the causes of pain. Like a young sprout, everything is produced in this way and turns in the three [evils]. (When) pain diminishes, then one thinks of reaching (the roots of) covetousness, desire, anger, and rage. Only then pain will be cut off. There is nothing that does not [derive] from these. The Eightfold True Path is like water people use to completely extinguish a fire. If one does not know that all the various pains are produced by oneself, then one forever will turn and return in life and death. Oh Kaundinya, you should know that pain must be gathered and cut off. Its subsiding is the proof. This is the way one should practise. Kaundinya, know this pain, then cut it off. With the evidence that it has abated, one practises the way and obtains samadhi. Know that when pain is cut off, and one has gathered proof of its having dwindled, that is practising the way. If people do not know the Four Truths, then they can not understand the Four Truths. This is the Truth, it is real. Pain is really hurtful. To amass it really is to really accumulate it. If it is reduced, it is really diminished. The way is real. Oh Kaundinya do you understand it or not?' Kaundinya said, 'I understand World Revered One. I know it, World Revered One. With this truth, I have obtained understanding. Thus call me Ajnata-Kaundinya'. Thus the Buddha turned [the wheel three times], [Preaching] the Four Truths, the Twelve Practices. 'The [Wheel of the] Law was turned. Oh Ajnata-Kaundinya. (15) Ibid., p. 122. [5] 131</page><page sequence="6">In the Law one is far removed from dirt and defilement, when one attains the Law, he sees purity'. In the sky the 80,000 navuta (one million) devas, also far from defilement, attained the Law and saw purely. When the earth spirit saw that in the countryside the Wheel of the Law was turned, his heart was very happy, and he sang out in a loud voice, 4[He has] turned the miraculous Wheel of the Law'. The gods in the sky heard this and were very happy, and they sang out to Brahmalokas heaven, where devas heard it and were happy without limit. They in turn sang out in loud voices, 'It was today in the deer park of Benares where the sages live, that the Wheel of the Law was turned. No one else in the whole world with its gods, men, Mar as, Brahmas, shamen, and Pala guardian of the gates could turn it'. The ground shook eighteen times. The celestial dragons of the eight quarters made music in the sky. Heavenly drums beat out by themselves; incense burned; a multitude of miraculous flowers were scattered; precious banners and canopies hung; there was singing and chanting. By itself a great light shone in the world. Ajnata Kaundinya, thus was the first disciple to awaken. The four disciples of the Mahanamas heard the Buddha had turned the Wheel of the Law and Ajnata Kaundinya had been awakened to the way. They thought, 'Would that the World Revered One preach the law to us that we also may be awakened to the way'. While they thought this they reverently looked at his face, their eyes did not leave (him) for a second. The World Honored One saw the four men in the way, far from the dust [of the world], [ready to] achieve [understanding of] the law and see purely. Then these five men saw the traces themselves, they prostrated themselves at the feet of the Buddha and said to him, 'Oh World Honored One, we five men already see the traces of the way. We now want to be on the path of the Buddha, to leave home and practise the way. We only want, World Honored Benevolence, to listen to your views'. Thus the World Honored One invited these five men to become Bhiksus. They cut off their hair themselves, putting on sramana clothing, they became sramana. Then the World Honored One asked these five men, 'You all are bhiksus. Do you know lewdness, think and practise discrimination between what is constant and what is transient, between what is painful and not painful, between what is emptiness and not emptiness, between what is the self and what is not self. When the five bhiksus heard the Buddha [preaching] on the five skandas of the way, they exhaustively understood it and achieved the state of arhatship and said, 'World Honored One, we accept discriminative thinking and actions, distinguish the real, the transient, pain, emptiness and the self. The true importance of the First Sermon is revealed in the closing passage of the Guoqu Xianzai Yinquo Jing: These were the first six arhats in the world. Of the (three) jewels, the first is the (person of the) Buddha; [the second] jewel is the Four Truths, or Dharma; and the [third] jewel is the five arhats of the Samgha. These three jewels are the greatest of all the riches in the world for men and gods. Thus the First Sermon marks the formulation of the third of the Three Jewels, 132 [6]</page><page sequence="7">for the audience were the first members of the Samgha. Although in the beginning the ordination of monks was undertaken by the Buddha himself with the formulaic expression 'Come Monk', as in the First Sermon (16), the authority of initiation was gradually transferred to the monastic community. According to LB. Homer's study of the Mahavagga, this convention of 'Come Monk' is rather short lived. He pointed out when Buddha sent his monks out to proselytize, bringing the new devotees back to the order became problematic, so the induction formula changed, and the monks themselves administered to the noviates request for admission and ordination. In the end 'the order alone had the authority, power, and legal right to ordain' (17). Thus the First Sermon commemorates the creation of the monastic community. The importance of the Samgha cannot be underestimated, for the sacred sayings were not, until many hundreds of years later, committed to written form. In the absence of a written canon, the authority of the tenets was entirely dependent on the eldest and most revered monks. Specialization arose so that no single person was responsible for the whole of the body of knowledge (18). At the famous First Council, which met after the death of the Buddha to regulate ordination and to confirm points of doctrine, the means of transmission was oral recitation. The authoritative monks, like Ananda, recited the discourses and the Samgha chanted their assent. The Samgha was the living body of the dharma. As Buddhism was largely dependent on conversion, unlike the hereditary Hindu religion, the Samgha, as the vessel of the Law and the means of ordination, was its life. It seems that the First Sermon, whether entirely factitious or a reconstruction of the events as they were thought to have occurred, perhaps at the First council, is really an attestation of the investment of authority in the Samgha as well as a celebration of its beginning. It was important to make everyone aware of the authority of the monastic community as possessor of the doctrine, thus the cycle of events relating to the First Sermon was added to the scriptures and depicted on the religious monuments. Artistic Evidence Among the earliest extant Indian artistic monuments so far known, clearly identifiable representations of the First Sermon are absent. The symbol repeatedly associated with the preaching of the Dharma in the texts and artistic monuments is the Wheel. It is a multivalent ancient symbol. Likened to a solar body, the wheel (16) Confusion is occasionally apparent in Chinese texts which use the three refuges, (taking refuge in the Buddha, the Law and his community), prior to the foundation of the community of monks. One example is found in the narration of the first meal after Enlightenment in the TRBJ, p. 479, and GXYJ, p. 643. (17) Transl. Horner, cit., p. ix. This occurs in the Second Discourse. (18) Ch. Eliot, Hinduism and Buddhism, 3 vols., London 1921, vol. I, p. 287. [7] 133</page><page sequence="8">is an emblem of the illumination of the world. In ancient India the wheel was also one of the marvelous possessions of the Cakravartin, the Wheel King; as such it is a most powerful weapon that conquers all foes. Representing the Dharma, the Wheel symbolically conveys the enlightening power of the doctrine that conquers all fears (19). Foucher identified the aniconic symbol of the wheel with the First Sermon, and though in later Indian art this is certainly the case, even a cursory view of the most ancient monuments calls this into question. Undoubtedly a metaphor for preaching, specific identification with the First Sermon is less certain (20). Among the remains of the railing that once stood at Bharhut (c. 2nd century B.C.), now in the Indian Museum in Calcutta, the wheel is not as frequent in comparison to other symbolic emblems like the st?pa or Bodhi tree and it occurs without a clue to identify it with the First Sermon. The wheel appears as an auspicious emblem on top of a column in a decorative role, as on the east gate (21) as well as in a narrative setting. The carving at the top of the Prasenajit pillar has the wheel at center draped with garlands, shaded by a parasol, housed in a two-story palatial enclosure, and flanked by two princely worshippers. King Prasenajit, drawn in his quadriga, approaches in the lower left section. The inscription reads Bhagavato dhatnma cakam, 'The Wheel of the Law of the Buddha'; a second inscription identifies: Raja Prasenaji Kosalo (22). The wheel is seen elsewhere, garlanded and worshipped, but none have any indication that the wheel represents the First Sermon (23). On the decorated gateways of St?pa I at Sanchi, two centuries or so later in date, emblematic and narrative depictions of wheels continue. Shown both as a wheel on a throne and as the crown of the Asokan column with ornate capitals, the Wheel of the Dharma is still less frequently employed than the other emblems (Fig. 1). These columns as isolated emblems appear on the square dies on the gateway in between the lintels of the architraves and in one narrative scene on the south gateway pillar of the North Torana (Fig. 2). This relief has been identified as the First Sermon because the wheel, supported on a lion capital, has a herd of grazing deer at the base of the column indicating the Deer Park location. But monks are not present among the fourteen people gathered around the column. Marshall, observing the absence of portrayals of monks at Sanchi, reasoned that there may have been an implicit (19) In the relatively late scripture the Lalitavistara, a special Bodhisattva brings Sakyamuni a precious wheel; see Foucher, op. cit., p. 151. (20) A. Foucher, Beginnings of Buddhist Art, Paris n.d., p. 88. (21) Cunningham, 1874: pi. VI. South east gate, inner face, pi. XIII. (22) Ibid, for inscription, p. 110. Cunningham also discussed the story of how King Prasenajit put up an image in the Buddha's absence. Cunningham believes that image was the Wheel of the Law. In a second carving the wheel is circumambulated: On the left the rear of an animal mount is visible, on the right two turbaned figures on horseback emerge, additionally four figures worship it. Ibid., pi. XXXI, 2: the wheel is shown supported by a column with elaborate capital, also flanked by worshippers. (23) Ibid., pi. XXXI 2 and pi.

In the scenes carved below, kingly processions are headed up towards the preaching Buddha and thus suggest the previous composition at Bharhut. By the time of the Kushan era in Gandhara, clearly identifiable compositions of the Buddha preaching the First Sermon are fairly numerous. However, unlike scenes of the Enlightenment which were standardized compositions since antiquity, there are a great many variations among the depictions, indicating the lack of a hallowed prototype. All Gandharan representations, like one in Calcutta (25) show the Buddha seated surrounded by his monks (Fig. 3). This is the first scene in the life of the Buddha which calls for monks to be portrayed. With the creation of the anthropomorphic image of the Buddha, came the portrayal of his disciples. They are distinguished from him in several ways, despite the similarity of dress. Aside from (24) J. Marshall &amp; A. Foucher, The Monuments of Sanchi, 3 vols., Calcutta 1940, vol. I, p. 189.

The Buddha also has a halo, and his entire person was usually covered with gold. Among the various details in Gandharan narratives of the First Sermon is the changeable number of members in the audience. Often they are limited to the traditional five monks, but in some examples their number ranges from six to seven. In addition there are attendant celestials and Vajrap?ni. This enigmatic deity, the wielder of the thunderbolt, is almost always present (26). A sculpture in the Freer is rather odd for although only three of the presumably original five monks are extant (in addition to celestials), a Kushan devotee and a brahmin immediately flank the Buddha, usurping the important position of the monks (Fig. 4) (27). Foucher has identified other strange members in the audience of the First Sermon, two examples have a woman present, and one relief has two Vajrap?nis (28). Although in Kushan art the Buddha is most often in abhayamudr?, the fear not gesture with the right hand raised, palm facing out, fingers pointing upwards, this is also not consistently applied. Several examples, like two reliefs in Taxila (26) The Sikri St?pa in Lahore has six monks, but no wheel or deer, Lahore Museum, Inv. no. 1254 or 827.

This gesture does not appear to evolve from his turning the wheel, which is excluded entirely, but seems to represent discoursing on the numbered points of the doctrine (31). One unusual example in the British Museum has Buddha in bh?misparsamudr?, the gesture for the Temptation scene; five monks and deer flanking the wheel assure however that this is the First Sermon (32).

Its depiction is also not standardized, it can be shown in profile, or frontally, mounted on either a column or as the triratna symbol of the Three Jewels. This inclusion of the wheel suggests the late date of the invention of the story, whose representation is fostered by a symbol that clearly indicates preaching. In fact aniconic representations of the First Sermon are found in the Kushan era, for example a relief from the Tokyo National Museum (Fig. 7), and two others in Peshawar and Lahore (33) show monks worshipping the symbol. Here too the number of monks can vary from the traditional five to six (34). The triratna symbol of the Three Jewels, which often supports the wheel, is perhaps a more appropriate emblem of the First Sermon. The Three Jewels, as three wheels or lotus flowers mounted on a trident, appear as early as Bharhut as a crowning element on the gateway, as an object of worship, and even as jewerly decor (35).

But several examples can be cited that lack representations of the deer but show the five monks (36). In contrast to the depictions of the Birth, Enlightenment, and Death the celestial celebrations of music making and falling flowers narrated at length in the texts are not ever represented with the First Sermon. Gandharan artists also attempted to depict secondary scenes of the Benares cycle narrated in the extended textual accounts, in particular the offering of a seat by the five ascetics before the First Sermon. One sculpture in the Peshawar Museum (Fig. 9) and another in the British Museum show the standing Buddha approached by the monks offering a seat (37). Parallel developments of the scene of the First Sermon are found at other Buddhist sites. Among a group of Mathuran icons ascribed to the period of Kaniska, five have bases with small-scale worshippers flanking a wheel, there are neither monks nor deer present. These sculptures, like the one in the Mathura Museum and another now in Taxila (Fig. 10), belong to the early stage when the wheel was used to indicate preaching in general, but not yet identified with the specific event (38). It is important to note that the same format is used for icons of the Jain founder Mah?vira, several of which are in the Mathura Museum (Fig. 11) (39). True pictorial narratives of the First Sermon appear much later and are rare, probably they are based on Gandharan examples. They are found among synoptic treatments of groups of biographical scenes told in an extremely abbreviated fashion, characteristic of the late phase in narrative development. Mudrds employed in these compositions also vary. In one relief in the Mathura Museum, Buddha is seated in abhayamudrd\ relegated to the area below are the secondary figures of two monks flanking a profile view of the wheel (40). Two Mathuran stele, one in Lucknow (Fig. 12) the other in the Mathura Museum (Fig. 13) show the Buddha actually turning the wheel with his right hand, as in (36) Pakistan, Dir Museum, Inv. no.

One Mathuran stele has the Buddha in dharmacakramudr?\ two gazelles are carved before his throne; three monks are on the left and two on the right; this is one of a set of Four Scenes (with the Nativity, Temptation and Parinirv?na) (Fig. 14) (42). Similarly, at Amar?vati, the Wheel of the Law in the early period is used to symbolically present the dharma, without reference to the event of the First Sermon. Later scenes can be associated with the First Sermon, but only by their context: Several examples are found among sets of the key events in the life of the Buddha. A mid-period relief in Madras has the aniconic treatment of the First Sermon with the Enlightenment below. But neither monks, deer, nor the triratna are present (Fig. 15) (43). A comparable format from the late period also from Madras has Buddha seated in abhayamudr? on a tall base flanked by figures, deer are in front of the base, but no wheel is carved (Fig. 16, detail Fig. 17) (44). In the last stage of evolution during the Guptan era, the icon of the Buddha seated in dharmacakramudr? dwarfs the narrative elements carved on the base. Examples from Ajanta abound; one sculpture in the Sarnath Museum has all of the details of the story formalized: The Buddha sits on a high back throne his hands counting the (41) De Young Museum: Ancient India, 1964, pi. 54, Inv. no.

In summation the story of the First Sermon is a celebration of the new authority of the Samgha. The date when the myth emerged in the texts is hard to determine; it is not present in the Chinese translations until the 3rd century. In the extant artistic evidence the representation of the First Sermon appears as early as the 1st century A.D. at Sanchi. Gradually the scene develops under Kushan patronage when so many other events of the life of the Buddha are illustrated. Evolution of the depiction of the First Sermon can be divided into four distinct phases in the major regional styles of Gandh?ra, Mathur?, and Amar?vati: At first the image of the wheel only represents the Buddha preaching. In the second stage the wheel is associated with the event of the First Sermon but the iconographical details are not yet codified, the number and identity of the listeners, gesture of the hands, inclusion of the deer and rendering of the wheel are irregularly employed. In the third phase all of the [17] 143</page><page sequence="18">I Fig. 13 - First Sermon and Parinirv?na, Mathura Museum. 144 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 15 - Detail First Sermon, Amaravati, Madras Museum (author's photo).

In the last stage, the narrative elements become very small in relation to the colossal Buddha. It was at that point, through the dramatic contrasts in scale, that the universal significance of the event becomes paramount and eclipses its quasi historical meaning.
