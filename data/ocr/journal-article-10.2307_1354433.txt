<plain_text><page sequence="1">Making the Cut: The Interplay of Narrative and System, or What Systems Theory Can't See N. Katherine Hayles T he originary moment for the creation of a system, according to Niklas Luhmann, comes when an observer makes a cut ("Cognitive Program"). Before the cut-before any cut-is made, only an undifferentiated complexity exists, impossible to compre- hend in its noisy multifariousness. Imagine a child at the moment of birth, assaulted by a cacophony of noise, light, smells, and pres- sures, with few if any distinctions to guide her through this riot of information. The cut helps to tame the noise of the world by introducing a distinction, which can be understood in its elemental sense as a form, a boundary between inside and outside (Brown). What is inside is further divided and organized as other distinc- tions flow from this first distinction, exfoliating and expanding, distinction on distinction, until a full-fledged system is in place. What is outside is left behind, an undifferentiated unity. Other cuts can be made upon it, of course, generating other systems. But no matter how many cuts are made there will always be an excess, an area of undifferentiation that can be understood only as the other side of the cut, the outside of the form. ? 1995 by Cultural Critique. Spring 1995. 0882-4371/95/$5.00. 71</page><page sequence="2">72 N. Katherine Hayles It is no accident that this story has a mythopoetic quality, for it is a mythology as much as a description. It is a way of explaining how systems come into existence that performs two tasks at once: it describes the generation of systems, and it also constructs the world as it appears from the viewpoint of systems theory. As the story indicates, the primary distinction necessary to be able to think systems theory is a cut that divides system from environment. According to systems theory's own account, however, there is also an outside to this cut, an area that from the viewpoint of systems theory can be seen only as a mass of undifferentiated world tissue. Another way to organize this material, I suggest, is narrative. The coexistence of narrative with system can be seen in Luhmann's ac- count of the creation of a system, for his account is, of course, itself a narrative. Its very presence suggests that systems theory needs narrative as a supplement, just as much, perhaps, as narrative needs at least an implicit system to generate itself. Narrative re- veals what systems theory occludes; systems theory articulates what narrative struggles to see. In constructing a narrative that will contest systems theory's account of how meaning is generated, I will follow Luhmann's ad- vice. To get beyond the space enclosed by a system's assumptions, he recommends looking at ideas that, within the confines of a given system, can appear only as paradoxes or contradictions. One enlarges or escapes from a system, he believes, by interrogating what cannot be made logical, straight, or ordered within the sys- tem. As we know, his version of systems theory begins with an ob- server making a distinction. Where does this observer come from? Is he brought into view through the action of another observer looking at him? If so, where does this second observer come from? The problem is not solved by supposing that the observer observes himself, for then we must ask where this capacity to observe him- self comes from. If we pose the question logically, as systems theory would have us do, it cannot be answered within the system, for it leads only to an infinite regress of observers, each of whom is constituted in turn by another observer. Suppose we take another path and construct the question as a historical inquiry. From what intellectual predecessor, what pre- existing body of discourse, does Luhmann draw in order to think</page><page sequence="3">Making the Cut 73 of beginning with the observer? The answer to that question is clear, for Luhmann himself provides it. This way of thinking about systems comes from a modification of autopoiesis, a concept de- fined and developed by the noted Chilean neurophysiologist, Humberto Maturana. To get outside systems theory and interro- gate what it cannot see, I will begin with a historical and narrative account of Maturana's work. More is at issue in this interrogation than Luhmann's construction of systems and Maturana's episte- mology, influential as they are. I seek to understand the tension between narrative and systemic thinking in general. Why does Foucault, especially in his early work, have such difficulty account- ing for epistemic shifts? Why does Lacan's account of psychological formations insist that women can find no way to represent them- selves? Why does any system, once it is exposed by a systems theo- rist, tend to seem inescapable and coercive? To get a purchase on these questions, let us look at systems theory from the other side of the cut, that is, from narrative rather than the proliferating dis- tinctions that constitute systems. Cutting Away the World: Defining the Living as a Closed System Maturana's epistemology is grounded in studies of percep- tion. In the famous article "What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain," Maturana and his coauthors demonstrated that a frog's visual system operates very differently from that of a human (Lett- vin, Maturana, McCulloch, and Pitts). Small objects in fast, erratic motion elicit maximum response, whereas large, slow-moving objects evoke little or no response. It is easy to see how such per- ceptual equipment could be adaptive from a frog's point of view, because it allows him to perceive flies while ignoring other phe- nomena irrelevant to his interests. The results imply that the frog's perceptual system does not so much register reality as construct it. As the authors put it, their work "shows that the [frog's] eye speaks to the brain in a language already highly organized and interpre- ted instead of transmitting some more or less accurate copy of the distribution of light upon the receptors" (1950). The work led Ma-</page><page sequence="4">74 N. Katherine Hayles turana to the maxim fundamental to his epistemology: "Every- thing said is said by an observer" (Maturana and Varela, Autopoiesis and Cognition xxii). Despite the potentially radical implications of the article's con- tent, however, its form reinscribed the conventional realist assump- tions of scientific discourse. Nowhere do the authors acknowledge that the reality they report is constructed by their sensory equip- ment no less than the frog's is by his. Faced with this inconsistency, Maturana had a choice. He could continue to work within the pre- vailing assumptions of scientific objectivity, or he could devise a new epistemology that would construct a picture of the world con- sistent with what he thought the experimental work showed. The break came with his work on color vision in primates, specifically humans. He and his coauthors found that they could not map the visible world of color upon the activity of the nervous system (Ma- turana, Uribe, and Frenk). There was no one-to-one correlation between perception and the world. They could, however, correlate activity in a subject's retina with his color experience. If we think of sense receptors as constituting a boundary between outside and inside, this result implies that organizationally the retina matches up with the inside, not the outside. From this and other studies, Maturana concluded that perception is not fundamentally repre- sentational. As Maturana recounts in Autopoiesis and Cognition, he and his coauthors decided to treat "the activity of the nervous sys- tem as determined by the nervous system itself, and not by the external world; thus the external world would have only a trig- gering role in the release of the internally-determined activity of the nervous system" (xv). Maturana's key insight was to realize that if the action of the nervous system is determined by its own organization, the result is necessarily a circular, self-reflexive dynamic. The organization of a system is constituted through the processes it engages in, and the processes it engages in are determined by its organization. To de- scribe this circularity, he coined the term autopoiesis, or self- making. "It is the circularity of its organization that makes a living system a unit of interactions," he and Varela wrote in Autopoiesis and Cognition, "and it is this circularity that it must maintain in or- der to remain a living system and to retain its identity through different interactions" (9). He regarded the autopoietic closure of</page><page sequence="5">Making the Cut 75 the space a system inhabits as the necessary and sufficient condi- tion for it to be alive. Building on this premise of autopoietic clo- sure, Maturana developed a new and startlingly different account of how we know the world. Here let me pause for a digression. Before discussing Matu- rana's epistemology, I want to register an objection to the leap he makes when he goes from saying perception is nonrepresenta- tional to claiming it has no connection with the external world. In my view, his data do notjustify this larger claim. Other researchers, among them Walter Freeman and Christine Skarda, have also ar- gued against a representational model of perception (Skarda). Freeman and Skarda's data on the olfactory perception of rabbits are akin to Maturana's results, in that the data indicate the rabbit's responses are transformative and highly nonlinear, influenced not only by the experience at hand but also by previous experiences the animal has had, his emotional state at the moment, and a host of other factors. To say the relation is transformative is different, however, from claiming there is no relation. The divorce of per- ception from external reality is at once the basis for the striking originality of Maturana's epistemology and the Achilles' heel that renders it vulnerable to cogent objections. What is this epistemology? I will approach it in an anecdotal and narrative fashion, a rhetorical mode quite different from the highly abstract and reflexive language of Autopoiesis and Cognition, the landmark work Maturana co-authored with Francisco Varela. (Later I will have more to say about the mode of Maturana's expo- sition and the purposes his rhetorical formulations serve.) To enter Maturana's world, consider how the world would look from the point of view of one of your internal organs, say your liver. To imagine this fully, you will need to leave behind as much of your anthropomorphic orientation as possible. Your liver has no plans for the future or regrets about the past; for it, past and future do not exist. There is only the present and the ongoing processes in which it engages. Similarly, because your liver has no way to con- join cause and effect, causality does not exist for it. If you drink excessive amounts of alcohol, it may develop cirrhosis, for it is structurally coupled to its environment and its processes change in coordination with changes in the environment. This coupling does not, however, constitute causality. The causal link you discern</page><page sequence="6">76 N. Katherine Hayles between drinking and cirrhosis is constructed by you as an ob- server; your liver knows nothing of it. Maturana's denial of causality is worth exploring in more depth. It is at once counterintuitive and central to his epistemol- ogy. Consistent with his premise of operational closure, he main- tains that no information is exchanged between a system and its environment. Events that happen in the environment do not cause anything to occur in the living organism. Rather, they are the his- torical occasions for triggering actions determined by a system's organization. The difference between an event "triggering" an ac- tion and "causing" it may seem to be a quibble, but for Maturana, the distinction is crucial. Causality implies that information moves across the boundary separating an organism from its environment and that it makes something happen on the other side. Say you slap me and I become angry. In the conventional view, one would say that your slap caused me to be angry. As this inference indi- cates, a causal viewpoint organizes the world into subject and ob- ject, mover and moved, transmitter and receiver. The world of causality is also the world of domination and control. Maturana sought to undo this perception by positing that living systems are operationally closed with respect to information. A system acts al- ways and only in accord with its organization. Thus, events can trigger actions, but they cannot cause them because the nature and form of a system's actions are self-determined by its organization. For example, if I am a masochist, I may be pleased rather than angry at your slap. Your slap is only the historical occasion for the self-determined processes that I engage in as a result of being structurally coupled to my environment. One implication of letting go of causality is that systems always behave as they should, which is to say, they always operate in ac- cord with their structure, whatever that may be. In Maturana's world, my car always works. It is I as an observer who decides that my car is not working because it will not start. Such "punctua- tions," as Maturana calls them, belong to the "domain of the ob- server" (Autopoiesis and Cognition 55-56). Because they are extrinsic to the autopoietic processes, they are also extrinsic to the biological description that Maturana aims to give of life and cognition. To accommodate the difference in states between, say, a car that will and will not start, Maturana makes a sharp distinction between</page><page sequence="7">Making the Cut 77 structure and organization. Structure refers to the actual state of a system at a given moment. Structure changes over time as an or- ganism grows, ages, contracts disease, recovers health. Organiza- tion, by contrast, defines the nature of the organism as such. Or- ganization can be thought of as the complete repertoire of all the structures that the organism can exhibit and still remain that or- ganism. When a system's organization changes, it ceases to be that kind of system and becomes something else, for example, dead rather than alive. Always leary of reification, Maturana stressed that organization, as a concept, exists only in the domain of the ob- server. On the level of autopoietic process, it is not a concept but an instantiated reality implicit in the constitutive relations of the processes to each other. It should be apparent by now that the cut Maturana makes between the observer and autopoietic process is intended to act as a prophylactic against anthropomorphism. Our commonsense intuitions about the world are relegated to the "domain of the ob- server," leaving the space of autopoiesis free from contamination by time, causality, motivation, intentionality, and desire. Thus emptied, the autopoietic space feels surprisingly serene, in much the same way that Buddhist notions of emptiness are serene. (It is interesting in this regard that Varela, Maturana's co-author, later connected his own version of embodied cognition with Buddhist philosophy [Varela, Thompson, and Rosch].) But serenity comes at a price. Autopoiesis, in the case of conscious organisms, must contain the observer, yet the observer, with his anthropomorphic projections and causal inferences, is precisely what has to be ex- cluded for autopoiesis to come into view as such. The strain of these contradictory necessities can be seen in Maturana's construc- tion of cognition. Clearly, cognition must emerge from autopoietic processes if it is not to be treated as an ad hoc phenomenon, a soul injected into the machine. But what kind of cognition can auto- poiesis produce? Because Maturana wants to eradicate anthropo- morphic projections from his account of the living, the cognition that he sees bubbling up from autopoiesis is empty of representa- tional content. It can thus scarcely qualify as conscious thought. At most, it precedes or underlies the familiar life-world of representa- tion that we occupy (or that occupies us). The divorce of consciousness from autopoietic process results</page><page sequence="8">78 N. Katherine Hayles in a curious gap in the theory's circular reasoning. How do we know autopoietic processes exist? Recall that Maturana's episte- mology is grounded in perceptual studies of the frog's visual sys- tem and primate color vision, among others. According to his epis- temology, these studies (along with every other construction that presupposes time, causality, and representation) rely on concepts that are not intrinsic to autopoiesis but rather are punctuations introduced by observers. We know autopoietic processes exist be- cause of these studies, but the epistemology of autopoiesis requires that these studies be regarded as "punctuations" extraneous and irrelevant to autopoiesis. The circularity that is one of the theory's strongest and most striking features is here interrupted by the cor- don separating the observer from the processes that must never- theless somehow give rise to her. The quarantine of the observer also requires that Maturana ignore the feedback loops that connect the observer with her auto- poietic processes. Suppose I have stalled my car on the railroad tracks and, as I struggle to get it started, I see a train speeding toward me. The future moment when the train will strike the car exists vividly in my imagination, and I have no difficulty foreseeing the causal chain of events that will splatter me and my car over the landscape. As a result of these punctuations, which according to Maturana exist only in my domain as an observer, my heartbeat accelerates, my respiration alters dramatically, and my endocrine system releases a flood of adrenaline into my body. Evidently, the observer is not only an observer but also an intrinsic part of the autopoietic totality. Why does this story, or its analogue, never get told in Autopoiesis and Cognition? To answer this question, I must take my narrative onto new ground and consider the rhetorical strategies that Autopoiesis and Cognition uses to construct its argu- ment. How the story is told is also part of the story. Self-Making as Literary Form: The Rhetoric of Autopoiesis Aside from the introductions, Autopoiesis and Cognition consists of two essays, "Biology of Cognition" and "Autopoiesis: The Or- ganization of the Living." In both essays, the writing is almost ex- clusively analytic, with one proposition related to another logically</page><page sequence="9">Making the Cut 79 in an argument that proceeds by division and subdivision, implica- tion and extension. There are only two examples of narrative, and they stand out because they are so unusual. In one, the authors illustrate the difference between an ordinary and an autopoietic viewpoint by supposing that two teams of builders are put to work constructing a house (53-55). The first team is told it is building a house, and each craftsman understands his work in that context. With the second team, no mention is made of a house. Rather, each craftsman is given a copy of a set of instructions and told which parts he is supposed to execute. In both instances, the fin- ished product is the same-the house is built. The first team thinks that it has been building a house all along, however, whereas the second team thinks only that it has been engaging in a set of speci- fied processes. The authors use the example to illustrate how a seemingly teleological project can emerge from processes that have no awareness of a larger goal. Although they do not interpret the example this way, it can also be used to illustrate why narrative is in tension with autopoiesis. The set of processes that the second team actuates could not be a story, or rather not a story anyone would find interesting, for lacking any sense of purpose, causality, or goal, it would consist only of a series of statements such as "this is happening, and then this is happening, and then something else is happening." To be effective, narrative requires a sense of how the present relates to past and future and of at least potentially causal relations between events. The second anecdote is even more revealing. In it, the au- thors imagine that a man is piloting a plane by following his instru- ment readings (50-51). When he lands, his friends and family con- gratulate him on his excellent feat of navigation. He is amazed at their admiration, for from his point of view, he has only been manipulating the controls so that the dials on his instruments stay within specified limits. Repeated with slight variations several times in Maturana's writing (sometimes the pilot is in a plane, at other times in a submarine), this anecdote evidently has special meaning for him. Tyrone Cashman speculates on its significance in an imaginary dialogue he constructs between Maturana and Sartre. He impishly has Sartre suggest that Maturana's epistemol- ogy, like Sartre's own views, were influenced by childhood experi- ences, particularly Maturana's poor eyesight. Sartre recalls a joke</page><page sequence="10">80 N. Katherine Hayles Maturana likes to tell on himself about being so nearsighted as a child that he could not tell the difference, until his brother pointed it out to him, between a stout lady waiting for a bus and a mailbox. Sartre says it is no wonder that Maturana makes a cut separating the observer from autopoietic processes, for what he observed as a child was indeed a punctuation different from what was there in reality. In Maturana's theory, Sartre observes, the world as we know it comes into existence when it is constructed by two observ- ers "languaging" between themselves. Maturana's epistemology thus reinscribes the linguistic acts of distinction that took place when his brother told him that the heavyset woman was not, after all, a repository for mail. How would this epistemology hold up, Sartre wonders, for a rural child with sharp eyesight, who before the age of 10 spent a great deal of time alone, by himself or herself, explor- ing woodlands and streams and lake shores, observing insects and the stages of plant life, stalking wild animals and listening to the subtle changes of bird calls-to such a person, your theory might sound absurd. Languaging, for him or her, pre- cisely inhibits good observation. When someone else is present, the natural world is perceived less vividly and richly. (Cash- man 6-7) This story, which we can consider a counternarrative to Ma- turana's anecdote about the pilot who flies blind, illustrates one of the dangers of narrative for someone who wants to construct a system. Unlike analytic writing, narrative is contextual. Instead of relying on numbered subdivisions to advance its plot, as Matu- rana's analytic writing does, narrative uses description. Inherent in the contextualization of narrative is a certain "loose bagginess" (as Henry James called it), for example, language necessary to set a scene or move the story from one locale to another. In Maturana's anecdote, there are phrases that put the man into the plane (or submarine) and take him out of it, even though these actions are not relevant to the story's point. Relevant, that is, in his interpreta- tion. As Cashman's send-up makes clear, what is extraneous and irrelevant in one reading can become highly relevant in another. Because narrative is contextual, it is polysemous in a way that ana- lytic writing is not. Getting a narrative to mean only one thing is</page><page sequence="11">Making the Cut 81 like getting a bowl of wiggling jello to have only one shape. The medium won't allow it. In addition to its contextuality, narrative differs from analytic writing in its use of historical contingency. When Maturana uses numbers to move from one statement to another, he is employing a semiotic system whose order is not in doubt, thus implying that the relation between his numbered statements is as definitive and noncontingent as the progression 1, 2, 3. Narrative, by contrast, characteristically reinscribes historical contingency, relating events that might have happened other than they did. It was not inevi- table that Maturana would be extremely nearsighted as a child and not wear corrective lenses, nor was it foreordained that Sartre as a child would be left alone to spend long days in the woods. Things just happened this way and (in Cashman's interpretation) later bore fruit in the two competing epistemologies. In contrast to these historical contingencies are the logical necessities that Maturana seeks to reveal through his analysis. Frequently, when he is obliged by custom or literary form to comment on his analytic writing (as in the introduction to Autopoiesis and Cognition or the "Comments" section of a journal article), he will express impatience, claiming that the piece is complete in itself and that to add anything further would be extraneous. These comments suggest that he regards his analytic writing as constituting a kind of closed autopoietic space in itself, secure in its circular organization and insulated against historical contingency. To bring that assertion (or illusion) of clo- sure into question, I turn now to an account of the historical con- tingencies that connect Maturana's theory to its predecessors in the Macy conferences. Accidents of History: How Homeostasis Became Autopoiesis As is often the case with heuristic examples, Maturana's anec- dote about the navigator did not come out of nowhere. It had a predecessor in the Macy conferences. Funded by the Josiah Macy Foundation, the Macy conferences were annual affairs and ran for nearly a decade, from 1946 to 1953. Attendance was by invitation only. The idea was to bring together a group of researchers work- ing at the forefront of their fields to forge a new interdisciplinary</page><page sequence="12">82 N. Katherine Hayles paradigm that became known, retrospectively, as cybernetics. Christened by Norbert Wiener, cybernetics was conceived as a sci- ence that would develop a common explanatory framework to talk about animals, machines, and humans by considering them as in- formation processors that encoded and decoded messages, exacer- bated or corrected their actions through feedback loops, and dem- onstrated circular causality (see Heims for an account of the Macy conferences). A key concept in the Macy conferences was homeostasis. Un- derstood as the ability of a system to maintain stability by keeping its parameters within certain limits, homeostasis was discussed in a context that made clear its relation to World War II. If homeostasis failed, W. Ross Ashby pointed out, the result was death, whereas if it succeeded, "your life would be safe" (qtd. in von Foerster, Cyber- netics 79). Ashby illustrated the concept with an anecdote about an engineer in a submarine. The engineer avoids catastrophe by keeping the ship's parameters stable. As a biological organism, he is a homeostatic system in a feedback loop with the ship, which is also a homeostatic system; he keeps its homeostasis functioning, and, as a result, he can maintain his own homeostasis as well. The example alludes to a situation that, in the context of the recent war, was resonant with danger; the man's vulnerable situation met- onymically stood for the larger peril of a society drawn back from the brink of destruction. In the wake of the war, homeostasis had a strongly positive valence, for it was the scientific counterpart to the "return to normalcy" that the larger society was fervently try- ing to accomplish. To illustrate homeostasis, Ashby constructed an electrical de- vice he called a "homeostat" that operated with transducers and variable resistors. When it received an input changing its state, the homeostat searched for the configuration of variables that would return it to its initial condition. In the postwar context, it seemed obvious that homeostatic calculations must include the environ- ment. If the environment is radically unstable, the individual organism cannot continue to survive. "Our question is how the organism is going to struggle with its environment," Ashby re- marked, "and if that question is to be treated adequately, we must assume some specific environment" (qtd. in von Foerster, Cybernet- ics 73-74). This specificity was expressed through the homeostat's</page><page sequence="13">Making the Cut 83 four units, which could be arranged in various configurations to simulate organism-plus-environment. For example, one unit could be designated "organism" and the remaining three the "environ- ment"; in another arrangement, three of the units might be the "organism," with the remaining one the "environment." Ashby ar- ranged the mechanism so that if the homeostat did not compensate for environmental changes within specified limits, it overloaded or "died." Elsewhere I have suggested that in the Macy conferences, homeostasis became the nucleus for a cluster of concepts that em- phasized equilibrium and stability (Hayles). The homeostasis con- stellation developed in relation and opposition to another constel- lation centered on reflexivity. Through the idea of the feedback loop, homeostasis already had built into it the notion of circular causality. The man in the submarine, when he manipulates the dials, effects a change in some variable, say the air pressure in the control room. As a result, the oxygen level increases, and the man can think more clearly and operate the dials more efficiently. Thus, the causal chain he initiated circles around to include his system as a biological organism as well. Applied to language, circular cau- sality opened up a passage into the dangerous and convoluted ter- ritory of reflexivity, for it implied that an utterance is at once a statement about the outside world and a reflection of the person who uttered it. It is significant that the word "reflexivity" does not occur in the Macy transcripts. Although the participants were struggling with ideas that, in contemporary usage, are commonly associated with reflexivity, the lack of a central term meant that the discussion was often diffuse, spreading out into diverse metaphors and dis- cursive registers. The most intense debate about what I am calling reflexivity was embedded in a discourse that had its own assump- tions, only one of which was reflexivity. This discourse was psycho- analysis. The conjunction between reflexivity and psychoanalysis was forged in the presentations made by Lawrence Kubie, a Freud- ian psychoanalyst associated with the Yale University Psychiatric Clinic. By all accounts, Kubie was a tendentious personality. Cer- tainly his presentations evoked strong resistance from many parti- cipants, especially the physical scientists. As if to demonstrate circu- lar causality, his repeated attempts to convince the scientists of the</page><page sequence="14">84 N. Katherine Hayles validity of psychoanalytic theory became more intransigent as they met resistance, and they evoked more resistance as they became more intransigent. Kubie's central message was that language is always multiply encoded, revealing more than the speaker realizes. When some of the scientists objected to this idea, wondering what evidence supported it, Kubie in personal correspondence inter- preted their resistance as hostility that itself required psychoana- lytic interpretation. It is no wonder that the scientists were en- raged, for in Kubie's hands, language became a tar baby that stuck to them the more they tried to push it away. The association of reflexivity with psychoanalysis meant, for many of the participants, that the concept was a dead end that had little or no scientific use- fulness. Not only could it not be quantified; it also subverted norm- ative assumptions about scientific objectivity. The particularities of this situation-Kubie's halitosis of the personality, the embedding of reflexivity within psychoanalytic dis- course, the unquantifiability of the concepts as Kubie presented them-put a spin on reflexivity that affected its subsequent devel- opment. The people at the Macy conferences who were convinced that reflexivity was a crucially important concept (including Mar- garet Mead, Gregory Bateson, and Heinz von Foerster) were marked by the objections it met within that context (see Brand for anecdotal evidence to this effect). The influence of these historical contingencies can be seen in von Foerster's treatment of reflexivity in Observing Systems. The punning title announces reflexivity as a central theme. "Observing" is what (human) systems do; in an- other sense, (human) systems themselves can be observed. The earliest essay in the collection, taken from a presentation given in 1960, shows that von Foerster was thinking about reflexivity as a kind of circular dynamic that could be used to solve the problem of solipsism. How does he know that other people exist, he asks? Because he experiences them in his imagination. His experience leads him to believe that they similarly experience him in their imaginations. "If I assume that I am the sole reality, it turns out that I am the imagination of somebody else, who in turn assumes that he is the sole reality" (7). In a circle of intersecting solipsisms, the subject uses his imagination to conceive of someone else, and then of the imagination of that person, in which he finds himself reflected; and so he is reassured not only of the other person's</page><page sequence="15">Making the Cut 85 existence, but of his own as well. That even a fledgling philosopher could reduce this argument to shreds is perhaps beside the point. Von Foerster seems to recognize that it is the philosophical equiva- lent of pulling a rabbit from a hat, for he purports to "solve" the paradox by asserting what he was to prove, namely, the existence of reality. Although the argument is far from rigorous, it is interesting for the line of thought it suggests. Even more revealing is the car- toon (drawn at his request by Gordon Pask) of a man in a bowler hat, in whose head is pictured another man in a bowler hat, in whose head is yet another man in a bowler hat. The potentially infinite regress of men in bowler hats does more than create an image of the observer who observes himself by observing another. It also bears a striking resemblance to Maturana's phrase "domain of the observer," for it visually isolates the observer as a discrete system inside the larger system of the organism as a whole. The correspondence is not accidental. In the aftermath of the Macy conferences, one of the central problems with reflexivity was how to talk about it without falling into solipsism or resorting to psycho- analysis. The message from the Macy conferences was clear: if re- flexivity was to be credible, it had to be insulated against subjectiv- ity and presented in a context where it had at least the potential for rigorous (preferably mathematical) formulation. As Norbert Wiener was later to proclaim, "[c]ybernetics is nothing if it is not mathematical" (Wiener 88). Throughout the 1960s, von Foerster remained convinced of the importance of reflexivity and experimented with various ways to formulate it. A breakthrough occurred in 1969, when he invited Maturana to speak at a conference at the University of Illinois. Maturana used the occasion to unveil his theory of"cognition as a biological phenomonon" (Autopoiesis and Cognition xvi). The power of Maturana's theory must have deeply affected von Foerster, for his thinking about reflexivity takes a quantum leap up in complex- ity after this date. In his 1970 essay "Molecular Ethology: An Im- modest Proposal for Semantic Clarification" (Observing Systems), von Foerster critiques behaviorism by making the characteristically reflexive move of turning the focus from the observation back onto the observer. Behaviorism does not demonstrate that animals are black boxes that give predictable outputs for given inputs, he</page><page sequence="16">86 N. Katherine Hayles argues. Rather, it shows the cleverness and power of the experi- menter in getting them to behave as such. "Instead ofseaching for mechanisms in the environment that turn organisms into trivial machines, we have to find the mechanisms within the organisms that enable them to turn their environment into a trivial ma- chine" (171). By 1972, the influence of Maturana on von Foerster is unmis- takable. In his 1972 essay "Notes on an Epistemology for Living Things," he casts Maturana's theory of autopoiesis into numbered quasi-mathematical propositions and gives it a circular structure, with the last proposition referring the reader back to the begin- ning (Observing Systems). The influence was mutual, for von Foer- ster's idea that the observer is located in an isolated arena became incorporated into Maturana's theory. Recall that von Foerster pro- duced the observer through imagining an infinite regress of men in bowler hats; something of this ad hoc production lingers in Ma- turana's conception. If we ask where Maturana's observer comes from, it is apparent that he is not a biological production, which would imply a physiological explanation of how autopoiesis gives rise to consciousness. (The absence of such explanation is scarcely surprising, given that contemporary cognitive science lacked a de- tailed picture of how consciousness bubbles up from autopoietic processes.) Rather, the production of the observer is accomplished rhetorically, by positing an enclosed space called "the domain of the observer." Not coincidentally, the enclosure of the observer in this domain also creates a sanitized space where reflexivity can be acknowledged without rebounding back to ensnare the observer in every utterance he makes. In fact, just the opposite happens. The observations of the observer reflect back on himself but do not have efficacy in explaining autopoietic processes, which happen on their own in another sphere that is constructed to be objective precisely because it excludes the observer from its informationally closed space. Reflexivity is thus rehabilitated from the taint of sub- jectivity it received from its association with psychoanalysis in the Macy discussions, but at the cost of erecting a prophylactic between the observer and autopoietic processes. Here it may be useful for me to pause and reflect, in reflexive fashion, on the kind of argument I have been fashioning. Whereas</page><page sequence="17">Making the Cut 87 the systems approach Maturana uses presents his theory as an autonomous entity sufficient in itself, the narrative approach I have been following shows how Maturana's theory both drew on and changed the concepts that preceded it. These changes did not happen gratuitously. At least in part, they were in response to par- ticular historical contexts that had invested the constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity with specific interpretations, values, and problematics. What logic is to system, historical contingency is to narrative. Had Kubie had a different personality, or had von Foerster not constructed the observer in terms of solipsism, or had Maturana not been invited to the Chicago conference, the reflex- ivity constellation might have developed other than it did. Al- though narrative may reach toward something approaching inevi- tability in seeing events as multiply determined, the kind of closure it evokes is qualitatively different from that which emerges from systems theory. The inevitabilities derive not from logical necessity but from contingency piled on contingency. Also different are the continuities narrative traces between what came before and what happened after. Whereas the systems approach treats systems as self-contained unities, the narrative ap- proach sees systems coming into existence through patterns of overlapping replication and innovation. New ideas are woven not out of whole cloth (even cloth must have its precedessors in thread, loom, and pattern) but are forged out of previous instantiations and contexts that are partly changed and partly replicated. The term I appropriated (from archeological anthropology) to describe this pattern of overlapping replication and innovation is "seria- tion." To see seriation in action, consider what happens to homeo- stasis as a concept evolving in specific historical contexts. As we have seen, for Ashby and his colleagues, homeostasis included the system plus the environment. Moreover, it used circular causal- ity-that is, feedback loops between the system and environ- ment-to return the system to equilibrium. The homeostat was an instantiation of a goal-seeking machine whose goal was stability. When it achieved stability, it was successful and "lived"; when it lurched into instability, it failed and "died." Considered essential for survival, homeostasis was thus linked to the idea of the living organism, although it included mechanical (and more specula-</page><page sequence="18">88 N. Katherine Hayles tively, social) systems as well. In this respect, it carried out the im- perative of the cybernetic program to create a common framework for animals, humans, and machines. When Maturana took it over, he redefined homeostasis so that the circle of causality no longer went from the system to the envi- ronment but rather was contained internally within the autopoietic processes. At the same time, he manifested his allegiance to biology by leaving behind mechanical and social systems and making the closure of the autopoietic space the necessary and sufficient condi- tion for a system to be living. He kept the idea of a goal, but now the goal was the continued production of the autopoietic space rather than stability. The goal of autopoiesis is more autopoiesis. Stability remained linked with survival, but the entities that were to be kept stable were redefined. No longer did survival demand that state variables had to remain within certain limits, as with ho- meostasis. Rather, the crucial entity that had to remain stable to ensure survival was organization. Instantiated within the autopoie- tic processes, a system's organization must persist unchanged through time for the system to retain its identity as such. By showing seriation at work, I do not mean to imply that autopoiesis, as a theory, is defective or patched up. In fact, seria- tion usually works in the opposite direction of progressive re- finement and fuller realization of the new elements that have en- tered the picture. Nor is it a reflection on Maturana's originality to show that he appropriated ideas from models that preceded his. According to my argument, almost everyone does. Indeed, Matu- rana's theory is striking in its boldness and in its uncompromis- ing vision of moving beyond anthropomorphic concepts of life. Although autopoiesis emerged from homeostasis, it is also substan- tially different from it, as I have indicated above. It actually repre- sents a blending of ideas from both the homeostasis and reflexivity constellations. From homeostasis, it appropriated stability, endur- ance, and survival; from reflexivity, the circular structure of a sys- tem turning back on itself to create a closed, self-referential space. It also explicitly rejects ideas that, in the Macy conferences, are associated both with reflexivity and homeostasis, for example, cir- cular causality (recall that, for Maturana, causality does not exist in itself but only as a connection made in the domain of the observer).</page><page sequence="19">Making the Cut 89 The innovations that make autopoiesis different from homeo- stasis are clearly laid by Paul Dell, a family systems theorist who has been at the forefront of the movement to apply autopoiesis to the field of family therapy. Dell points out several ways in which the language of homeostasis contains implications that are incom- patible with autopoiesis. The one most relevant here, perhaps, is his argument that, whereas homeostasis implies that a system will remain the same, autopoiesis implies that a system will change. When Ashby designed the homeostat, he conceptualized it as a mechanism that searched for a function E-1 that compensates for a function E expressing complex change in the environment. As a result of this compensation, the machine's variables remain within specified limits. Its purpose, on this view, is to return the system back to an equilibrium whenever it is disturbed. From an autopoie- tic viewpoint, by contrast, the system is a system precisely in the sense that its components interact with each other; none can be separated out from the whole. Moreover, the system never reacts to changes in the environment, only to changes within itself trig- gered by its structural coupling with the environment. If one com- ponent changes-if, for example, the daughter of an alcoholic fa- ther ceases to facilitate his drinking-all of the other components have to change as well, because the interactions between them have changed. This reasoning implies that from an autopoietic viewpoint, change anywhere in the system drives the system to- ward a new configuration rather than back toward a prior equilib- rium point. Put this way, autopoiesis sounds as if it ought to be amenable to narrative progression, despite the self-circularity of its theoreti- cal structure. The idea is put to the test in another book Maturana co-authored with Varela. The Tree of Knowledge proposes to articu- late autopoiesis together with the theory of evolution. Because the theory of evolution is about change and historical contingency, it is fundamentally narrative. I have been suggesting that systems theory and narrative constitute opposite approaches to the con- struction of meaning. What happens when systems theory meets evolution?</page><page sequence="20">90 N. Katherine Hayles The Circle Versus the Line: A Disjointed Articulation The circular structure of autopoiesis provides the inspiration for the literary form of The Tree of Knowledge. As the opening dia- gram of the chapters indicates, the authors envision each chapter leading into the next, with the final one coming back to the begin- ning. "We shall follow a rigorous conceptual itinerary," they an- nounce in the introduction, "wherein every concept builds on pre- ceding ones, until the whole is an indissociable network" (9). The structure is meant to enact their central idea that "all doing is knowing and all knowing is doing" (27) by showing the interrela- tion between simple and complex living systems. Accordingly, they start with unicellar organisms (first-order systems), progress to multicelluar organisms with nervous systems (second-order sys- tems), and finally to cognitively aware humans who interact through language (third-order systems). Humans are made up of cells, of course, so celluar mechanisms must be at work in complex systems as well; in this way, the end connects with the beginning. Autopoiesis, the continuing production of processes that produce themselves, is the governing idea connecting systems at all levels, from the single cell to the most complex thinking being. "What defines [living systems] is their autopoietic organization, and it is in this autopoietic organization that they become real and specify themselves at the same time" (48). Instantiating a linear narrative that turns into a circle, the book simulates an autopoietic structure in which the details produce the overall organization, and the or- ganization produces the details. Traversing this path, the "doing" of the reader-the linear turning of pages as she reads-becomes also a kind of "knowing," for she experiences the structure of auto- poiesis as well as comprehends it when the text circles back on itself. The problem comes when the authors try to articulate this circular structure together with evolutionary "lineages"-literally, the creation of lines. In evolution, lineage carries both the sense of continuity (traced far enough back, all life originates in single-cell organisms) and qualitative change, as different lines branch off from one another and follow separate evolutionary pathways. Here I want to mark an important difference between evolution and autopoiesis: whereas in autopoiesis lines become circles, in</page><page sequence="21">Making the Cut 91 evolution lines proliferate into more lines as speciation takes place through such mechanisms as genetic diversity and differential rates of reproductive success. In an attempt to finesse this differ- ence, Maturana and Valera proclaim repeatedly that for an organ- ism to continue living, it must conserve autopoiesis as well as adap- tation. And how does it do this? By remaining structurally coupled to its environment. As incremental changes occur in the environ- ment, corresponding incremental changes also occur in the organ- ism. Thus, the organism always remains within the circle of auto- poiesis, but this circular motion can also move along a line, as when a rolling ball falls downhill. "Ongoing structural change of living beings with conservation of their autopoiesis is occurring at every moment, continuously, in many ways at the same time. It is the throbbing of all life" (100). The articulation of autopoiesis with evolution thus hinges on the claim that structures gradually evolve while still conserving autopoiesis. To describe the change that takes place, the authors use the term "natural drift." There seems to be a natural drift in "natural drift," however, and in later passages it becomes "struc- tural drift." If structure changes, what does it mean to say that autopoiesis is conserved? Here they fall back on the distinction be- tween structure and organization they had previously used in Auto- poiesis and Cognition: "Organization denotes those relations that must exist among the components of a system for it to be a member of a specific class. Structure denotes the components and relations that actually constitute a particular unity and make its organization real" (47). Interestingly, they use a mechanical rather than a bio- logical analogy to illustrate the distinction. A toilet's parts can be made of wood or plastic; these different materials correspond to differences in structure. Regardless of the material used, however, it will still be a toilet if it has a toilet's organization (47). The anal- ogy is strangely inappropriate for biology. For life forms based on protein replication, it is not the material that changes but the way the material is organized. What does it mean, then, to claim that autopoiesis is con- served? According to them, it means that organization is con- served. And what is organization? It is "[t]hose relations that must exist among the components of a system for it to be a member of a specific class" (47). These definitions force one to choose between</page><page sequence="22">92 N. Katherine Hayles two horns of a dilemma. Consider the case of an amoeba and a human. Either an amoeba and a human have the same organiza- tion, which would make them members of the same class, in which case evolutionary lineages disappear because every living system has the same organization, or an amoeba and a human have differ- ent organizations, in which case organization-and hence auto- poiesis-must not have been conserved somewhere (or in many places) along the line. The dilemma reveals the tension between the conservative circularity of autopoiesis and the linear thrust of evolution. Either organization is conserved and evolutionary change is effaced, or organization changes and autopoiesis is ef- faced. Contrary to the author's assertions, the circle cannot be seamlessly articulated with the line. Whatever recuperations the authors attempt through their title, the tree Darwin used to image descent has a branching structure that remains at odds with the circularity of autopoiesis. The strain of trying to articulate autopoiesis with evolution is most apparent, perhaps, in what is not said. Genetics is scarcely mentioned, and then in contexts that underplay its importance. At one point, the authors acknowledge that "modern studies in ge- netics have centered mainly on the genetics of nuclear acids," but they suggest that other heredity systems have been obscured by this emphasis, including "those associated with other cellular com- ponents such as mitochondria and membranes" (69). Elsewhere they acknowledge that they have "skimmed over" population ge- netics but claim that "it is not necessary to scrutinize the underly- ing mechanisms" (i.e., genetics) to understand "the basic features of the phenomenon of historical transformation of living beings" (115). In the absence of any discussion of genetics, how do they explain evolutionary change? They do so through an organism's structural coupling with the environment, combined with the structural diversity introduced by (sexual) reproduction. One is left with the impression that the primary mechanism of evolution is structural change within an organism due to its interactions with its environment, which are passed on to its offspring. "To sum up: evolution is a natural drift, a product of the conservation of autopoiesis and adaptation" (117). Thus, they concur with Lamarck and Darwin, placing themselves outside the synthesis between evolution and genetics that produced contemporary evolutionary biology.</page><page sequence="23">Making the Cut 93 Given their emphasis on autopoiesis, it is perhaps obvious why they choose to sidestep genetics, for any discussion of genetics would immediately make clear that the distinction between struc- ture and organization cannot be absolute-and if this distinction goes, then autopoiesis is no longer conserved in evolutionary pro- cesses. For if organization is construed to mean the biological classes characterized as species, then it is apparent that organiza- tion changes as speciation takes place. If organization means some- thing other than species, then it ceases to distinguish between dif- ferent kinds of species and simply becomes instead the property of any living system. Conserving organization means conserving life, which may be adequate for autopoiesis to qualify as a property of living systems but does nothing to articulate autopoiesis with evolutionary change. The essential problem here is not primarily one of definitions, although it becomes manifest at these sites in the text because they are used to anchor the argument, which otherwise drifts off into such nebulous terms as "natural drift." Rather, the difficulties arise because of Maturana's passionate desire to have something con- served in the midst of continuous and often dramatic change. Leaving aside the hand-waving explanations of structure and organization, that something is basically the integrity of a self- contained, self-perpetuating system that is operationally closed to its environment. In Maturana's metaphysics, the system closes on itself and leaves historical contingency on the outside. Even when he is concerned with the linear branching structures of evolution, he turns this linearity into a circle and tries to invest it with a sense of inevitability. Narrative is encapsulated within system, like a fly within amber. Seen as a textual technology, The Tree of Knowledge is an engine of knowledge production that vaporizes contingency by continuously circulating within the space of its interlocking as- sumptions. Like many postwar systems, including Foucault's epistemes and Lacan's psycholinguistics, autopoiesis is profoundly subversive of individual agency. It therefore makes an interesting comparison with Richard Dawkins' idea of the "selfish gene," another theory that locates the essence of life in aconscious processes rather than conscious subjectivity. Whereas Maturana elides genetics, Dawkins foregrounds it. This difference reflects a deeper divergence in their treatments of agency. Dawkins images humans as "lumbering</page><page sequence="24">94 N. Katherine Hayles robots" controlled by their genes, but agency is not missing from his scheme; it is simply displaced from the conscious mind into the genes. The social and economic formations associated with ram- pant individualism, especially capitalism, are as vigorous as ever in Dawkins's rhetoric and narratives. The players may have shrunk to microscopic size, but the rules of the game-and the stakes it entails-remain the same. Maturana, by contrast, constructs agency as a contest over how the boundaries are drawn that consti- tute systems. Complex systems are made up of parts that are them- selves autopoietic entities. Thus, a human is constituted through its cells, which in turn are made up of yet smaller entities. Which of these autopoietic systems is subordinate to which? The answer, for Maturana, is not so much a given as an ethical imperative that depends on prior assumptions about freedom and what he un- ashamedly calls "love." In an organism, the component unities are properly subordinated to the organismic whole. The case is different for a society. There, the system exists for the benefit of its component parts, namely individual humans. For Maturana, autopoiesis resides finally and most forcefully at the level of the in- dividual. Other than as an ethical imperative, why this should be so remains shrouded in mystery. Because past and future do not exist in Maturana's scheme except as modes of existing in the present, it is not possible to ground this imperative in a myth of origin. "The business of living keeps no records concerning origins," he and Varela write in The Tree of Knowledge. All we can do is generate explanations, through language, that reveal the mechanism of bringing forth a world. By existing, we generate cognitive "blind spots" that can be cleared only through generating new blind spots in another domain. We do not see what we do not see, and what we do not see does not exist. (242) One of these cognitive blind spots, I have been arguing, is narra- tive. And one of the windows that opens onto it, I have further suggested, is the construction of the observer in systems theory. When Niklas Luhmann makes the move of turning the construc- tion of the observer into an origin, he departs from the circularity</page><page sequence="25">Making the Cut 95 of autopoiesis and begins a new cycle in the seriated pattern of overlapping innovation and replication that lies at the heart of my narrative. The Observer as Origin: Luhmann's Reinscription of Maturana When Luhmann begins with the observer, in a stroke he does away with the difficulties Maturana encountered by rhetorically constituting the observer within a separate "domain" isolated from the autopoietic system ("Cognitive Program" and Essays on Self- Reference). Far from being imprisoned within the system and ex- isting in an ad hoc relation to it, the observer now generates the system by drawing a distinction. The reflexivity that appeared so threatening within the context of the Macy conferences, after being sanitized and encapsulated in an isolated domain, thus re-enters the system at a foundational moment. Perhaps Luhmann felt free to make this move because he is primarily concerned with social theory rather than biology. As a social theorist, he obviously does not have the same stake as Matur- ana in avoiding anthropomorphic projections of what life is. Just as Maturana redescribed terms and shifted emphases when he inscribed into biology ideas appropriated from cybernet- ics, so Luhmann changes as well as reinscribes autopoiesis when he takes it into social theory. Insofar as Maturana succeeds in linking autopoiesis with life, he wins for it a central position within biology, for it addresses a concern fundamental to the discipline. When Luhmann applies autopoiesis to social systems, he is led by this history to say that social systems are alive. But in importing the claim into a different disciplinary context, he also changes its posi- tion. Whereas for Maturana the connection with life is crucial, in Luhmann the claim that social systems are alive does no interesting work within his theory and, indeed, is scarcely developed beyond this bare assertion. It rather exists as a skeuomorph, that is, a fea- ture that served an instrumental purpose in previous instantia- tions but now works as an allusion and a link to the past. The fabric of seriation is woven out of skeuomorphs as much as innovations. The pattern of seriation can also be seen in Luhmann's appro-</page><page sequence="26">96 N. Katherine Hayles priation of other ideas central to autopoiesis. Consider Maturana's postulate that autopoietic systems are informationally closed and that they always conserve their organization. In Luhmann these ideas are transformed into his premise that social systems are opera- tionally closed (Differentiation of Society and "Operational Closure"). The difference between operational and informational closure is revealing. Recall that for Maturana, the idea of closure was grounded in his studies of perception. For Luhmann, perception is more or less beside the point, because he is dealing with societies rather than organisms. Accordingly, the mechanism of closure is dis- placed from the working of perception onto the working of codes. One system cannot communicate with another because they em- ploy different codes; the operations that a system can perform is defined and contained by the codes it employs. The circularity of autopoiesis is thus realized for Luhmann in the interplay between a system's codes and its organization. The operations it performs through its codes define its organization, and its organization de- fines the codes. In Maturana, the essence of life is displaced from (human) consciousness onto aconscious autopoietic processes. In Luhmann, this displacement is registered as the play of codes within a system. Luhmann does not see social interactions as ex- changes between purposeful individuals with complex psycholog- ies. Rather, interaction takes place between the codes that social agents employ. It is the codes, not the agent's conscious thoughts or perceptions, that structure the situation. When one goes out to drink, one employs the code of drinking, and it is this code, not the individual's thoughts or activities, that constitute drinking as drinking. What autopoietic biological processes are to Maturana, social codes are to Luhmann. We saw earlier that Maturana constructed agency in terms of where a system's boundaries are drawn. From societies to organ- isms to cells, systems are complex unities that themselves are com- prised of systems that are complex unities. The question of which level can or should subordinate the other levels to itself is for Maturana an ethical issue that cannot be decided within systems theory. There is nothing inherent in the nature of systems that dictates the organism should dominate its subsystems, whereas a society should be subordinate to its subsystems. Maturana recog- nizes the fragility of this argument when he identifies it with love.</page><page sequence="27">Making the Cut 97 In a theory remarkable for the circularity of its interlocking prem- ises, love enters as excess, emerging not from necessity but desire. A similiar dynamic is played out in Luhmann's work in his idea of a functionally differentiated society. Whereas in medieval times societies were organized vertically, with each subsystem subordi- nate to the larger system that contained it, in the modern period some societies have achieved a horizontal structure that enables different subsystems to operate independently of one another. This is the kind of structure that Luhmann prefers, for he believes it fosters diversity and minimizes coercion. But he recognizes that there is nothing inevitable about its emergence. Indeed, he re- gards it as sufficiently improbable so that it is at any time liable to collapse and revert back to a hierarchical structure, as happened in Nazi Germany. Thus, the fragility of love and the vulnerability of desire is replicated as well as changed in Luhmann's reinscrip- tion of autopoiesis. Of all these seriated relationships, perhaps the most crucial is the one with which we began: the point at which the observer is inserted into the system. By moving the observer to the point of entry or origin, Luhmann opens the system-any system-to al- ternative constructions. As a result, although his systems are no less closed than Maturana's, the activity of system-making is consid- erably more open. The difference is registered in the phrase that Luhmann adapts from Maturana's dictum "we do not see what we do not see." In a reinscription that is also an innovation, Luhmann writes that "reality is what one does not perceive when one per- ceives it" ("Cognitive Program" 76). Like Maturana, Luhmann postulates a realm that remains apart from the constructed world of human perception. But unlike Maturana, he twists the closed circle of tautological repetition ("we do not see what we do not see") into an asymmetric figure ("one does not perceive when one perceives"). The energy generated by these contradictory proposi- tions rebounds like a loaded spring toward the very term that Ma- turana's closure was designed to erase, namely "reality." What is enacted rhetorically within the structure of this sentence is for- malized in Luhmann's theory by investing the observer with the agency to draw a distinction. By making a distinction, the ob- server reduces the unfathomable complexity of undifferentiated reality into something she can understand; by proliferating distinc-</page><page sequence="28">98 N. Katherine Hayles tion on distinction, she begins to reproduce within this space of differentiation some of the complexity and diversity of a reality that remains forever outside (Differentiation of Society and "Opera- tional Closure"). The importance of Luhmann's positioning of the observer has been recognized in different ways by a number of theorists writing in this volume. William Rasch concentrates on the siren call of the transcendent, which he sees Luhmann, along with his predecessor Wittgenstein, successfully resisting; Jonathan Elmer notes parallels between Luhmann's theory and Lacan's construction of the ob- server in the mirror stage; Cary Wolfe argues persuasively that Luhmann's importance for this cultural moment lies in the alterna- tive he offers to the seemingly endless quarrels between construc- tivists and realists. My argument seeks to position itself at the very point where the observer comes into view at all. When Luhmann acknowledges that the observer, by drawing a different distinction, can generate a different kind of system, he opens a trap door out of the coerciveness of systems. But this is a limited kind of escape, for in Luhmann's metaphysics, escape from one system is achieved only by entering another system. My efforts have been directed toward providing an alternative-not another system, but another way of organizing the material that is narrative rather than sys- temic. To recapitulate: the advantage I claim for narrative is that it renders the closures systems theory would perform contingent rather than inevitable, thus mitigating the coercive effects that sys- tems theory can sometimes generate. As I see it, the problem with systems theory is that once a system stands revealed in all its perva- siveness and complexity-whether it be the invisible workings of power in Foucault's society of surveillance, Lacan's psycholinguis- tics, or Maturana's autopoiesis-the system, precisely because of its logic and power, is likely to seem inevitable and inescapable. Among systems theorists, Luhmann is remarkable in seeing that every system has an outside that cannot be grasped from inside the system. If his own inclination is toward the closure of system rather than the contingency of narrative, he nevertheless has the intellectual honesty and generosity of spirit to see that closure too has an outside it cannot see. And this has given me room to argue that the very interlocking assumptions used to achieve closure are</page><page sequence="29">Making the Cut 99 themselves the result of historical contingencies and embedded contextualities. Thus, in my reading, a system looms not as an in- evitability but rather emerges as a historically specific construction that always could have been other than what it is, had the accidents of history been other than what they were. In this reading, one exits the system not merely to enter another system, but to explore the exhilarating and chaotic space of constructions that are contin- gent on time and place, dependent on specific women and men making situated decisions, partly building on what has gone before and partly reaching out toward the new.
