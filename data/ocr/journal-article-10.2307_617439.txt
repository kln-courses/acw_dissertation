David develops in The Book of Mirrors the notion of the ten ZaAzakot-' dazzling lights that precede the emanation of the Sefirot ' (Introduction, p. 23). Idel has pointed out the anthropomorphic structure of these ' Sefirot which lie above the Sef rot ', suggested their gnostic origin and demonstrated the connexion between them and Luria's concept of Adam Kadmon (Idel Daat, 4). Similarly, the Lurianic notion of Parzm-the anthropomorphic configurations (literally-' faces ') of ten Sefirot which become the manifestations of Adslm Kadmon in the world of ' restoration ' ( Tikkun), can be shown to derive from a similar usage in The Book of Mirrors (Idel, Daat, 7). The publication of this work in the present edition is, therefore, important, not only because it sheds light on the Zohar and its circle, as Scholem had recognized, but also because it makes accessible for the first time a major work by a man who has begun to emerge as an important and influential Kabbalist in his own right, heading a circle of Kabbalists which seems to constitute the ' missing link ' in the history of the Kabbalistic tradition between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries (see Idel, Jerusalem Studies, II/2, 206). The edition is based on sound scholarship. It is an adaptation of the editor's 1978 doctoral dissertation at Brandeis University, an institution from which a number of im- portant Kabbalistic studies have emanated in recent years and which has formed, under the supervision of Alexander Altmann, the only centre (since the death of George Vajda in Paris) for the serious study of the Kabbalah outside Israel. The introduction, though compact and somewhat limited in scope (con- fining the analysis of R. David's Kabbalah to The Book of Mirrors alone, to the virtual exclusion of his other works) is extremely lucid. The section on the title of the book (2.4, pp. 8-10) is an excellent example of this: it isolates the various complex traditions which underly the Hebrew title (literally-a phrase taken from Exodus 38: 8 which the King James version translates as ' the looking glasses of the women assembling [... at the door of the tabernacle] ') and justifies fully the editor's response to the near-impossible task of finding an English equivalent, even though at first sight it seemed to sacrifice too much of the familiar flavour of the original. Occa- sionally the language of discourse, especially the translations into English, seems to read like a science fiction script ('. . . a raid on the riches of emanation: the outside forces snatch and grab the flow from the paths [of the sefirot] . . .', p. 31), but then the material does rather lend itself to this mocle and may in turn have inspired some recent output in the genre. One cannot conclude w-ithout lamenting (alas, in vain) the abominable and prevalent practice of separating the critical notes from the text by tucking them away at the enci of the book. Tiresome in a11 cases, this method whether he is simply not concerned with any- thing which is not directly related to the text he has edited. is especially inappropriate for the publication of critical editions of highly technical texts such as the present volume. The full weight of original scholarship lies mainly in the notes. Their location makes this book extremely unwieldy. AVA RAPOPORT-ALBERT WARREN C. TREXCHARD: Ben Sira s view of eaomen: cz literar?y analysis. (Bro+X7n Judaic Studies, 38. j x, 341 pp. Chico, California: Scholars Press, 1982. $15.75. Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus Ben Sirach, provides a unique resource for the student of wisdom literature as well as for those interested in the intellectual and social currents operative in the Jewish community at a time when the Hebrew Bible sra.s assuming its final form and when Jewish religio-cultural patterns were being challenged and reshaped by the confrontation ^ith Hellenism. Ancient wisdom materials are notoriously difficult to classify or understand in terms of genre and purpose, with their characteristic lack of chronological and contextual markers con- tributing in no small measure to this problem. Ben Sira stands as a remarkable exception: the date of composition can be reasonably well fixed (to the early second century B.C.E.); the author himself is known by name; and his personal interests and experiences can be glimpsed from internal evidence in his book, which is preserved in Greek and in reliable Hebrew portions from ancient and medieval times. One noteworthy aspect of Ben Sira's sagacious counsel, which covers a wide range of human activities and social situations, is his attention to females. As Trenchard points out in this xlJork, which is a slightly revised edition of his University of Chicago doctoral thesis, about 7 per cent of the 1390 verses in Sirach deal with women. The quantitative signifi- cance of this material certainly justifies a study of Ben Sira's treatment of women. Precisely because wisdom literature in general contains the frequent, although poorly understood usage of female imagery and because this specific apocryphal example of wisdom can be con- textually located, the contributions of such an analysis would indeed be significant. Unfortu- nately, this potential is not fulfilled, perhaps because the author has defined his goals in too narrow a fashion. Trenchard has seized upon the opposing claims of the few existing studies of women in Sirach, namely, that either Ben Sira was personally antagonistic towards women or that his attitude tovards women is negative only insofar as he reflected contemporary society, and has set out to resolve the issue about the nature of Ben Sira's view of women. Adopting the former position as his working hypothesis, he performs the valuable task of producing a careful textual and tradition-compositional analysis of all the passages which deal with females directly or which divulge in some way the ancient author's thinking about females. To do so, he has organized the appropriate</page><page sequence="2">340 REVIEWS verses into five categories: (woman as) good wife, mother and widow, bad wife, adulteress and prostitute, and daughter. Although there is some minor overlap in these groupings and alternative arrangements might be suggested, the analytical process itself is to be com- mended. The author has discovered nuances in Ben Sira's reworking of traditional statements that betray a sharpening of an already existing tendency towards an unfavourable presenta- tion of female behaviour or character. Such discoveries have led Trenchard to the entirely credible conclusion that the book's antagonistic tone reflects the personal antipathy of its author. The anti-female stance of Ben Sira thus represents a stronger or more exaggerated posture than occurs in the sources from which he draws. Yet by calling this fact a function of ' personal, negative bias ', Trenchard implies that such an attitude is an individual aberra- tion, cut loose from social context. While personal psychohistory alone may account for individualized response, the influence of social patterns and pressures deserve at least a hearing. Particularly since the specific setting of the book of Sirach can be identified, the nature of that setting with respect to gender- based attitudes demands consideration. This is especially essential since cultural documents can, for certain pre-industrial societies, con- stitute a public expression of strong andro- centric positions which serve to compensate for, or even disguise private realities of con- siderable female power. Because Trenchard perhaps erroneously assumes that females in Ben Sira's day were fully under male control the possible existence of statements of male dominance in contradiction to a reality of female importance in a domestic-oriented community cannot be ignored. That is, Ben Sira's vehemence could reflect a society in which males needed to assert domestic superiority because their actual exercise of public power had been threatened or curtailed. Could not the Seleucid interference with the established Judean self-governance that had prevailed under the Ptolemies have upset the channels for exercise of power in the public realm and thus disturbed the domestic mechanisms ? Seleucid policies at exactly Ben Sira's period clearly had disturbed Judea greatly enough to have caused the eruption of armed revolt within a generation. This is a complicated issue, usually dealt with by the subdisciplines of political and/or social anthropology for more recent societies. The difficulty of investigating shifting patterns of public and domestic balances of power in ancient society is not to be minimized. Yet since such patterns can determine an in- dividual's stance on the important topic of male attitudes towards women, an investiga- tion of any single case cannot ignore the multi- farious factors which might cause such attitudes. Conceivably, a full analysis of gender and power in the early second century community in Judea might reveal subtle tensions which surface in Ben Sira's apparently misogynistic treatment of women but which cannot be simply attributed to his personal situation. Consequently, the assertion that Ben S;ra's negative bias towards women is personal may be an erroneous conclusion, one that distorts unnecessarily his character and thereby does a disservice to an influential wisdom author whose proto-Saduccean views have already earned him enough unfavourable evaluations. Trenchard's exegesis has laid an important foundation for the pursuit of his goal; but in choosing not to address the contextual dimension, he has cut himself off from evidence that might contradict the results of his painstaking penetration of the compositional characteristics of Sirach's pas- sages dealing with women. Two further observations bear mention. First, the lexical analyses that are provided in the book suffer by their failure to consult relevant literature other than that of the Hebrew Bible. Although the book of Proverbs of course cannot be surpassed as a source for lexical consultations, surely certain Qumran or Mishnaic texts could provide more relevant data than do pentateuchal or deuteronomistic passages. Second, the author's repeated assertion that Ben Sira treated women only in one of the socially acceptable or liminal roles vis-a-vis men but never as ' independent ' human beings suggests that he believes it might have been otherwise. He therein betrays a modern perspective whereby women should be seen as independent entities and be treated as social equals rather than adjuncts, and inJects an unnecessary and unwarranted tone of sarcasm into an otherwise scholarly pre- sentation. CAROL MEYERS VERMONDO BRUGNATELLI: Questionz di morfologia e sintassi dez numerali cardinali semitici. (Pubbl., Fac. di Lettere e Filosofia dell'Universita di Milano, XCIII. Sezione a cura dell'- Istituto di Glottologia, 7.) xiii, 167 pp. Firenze: La Nuova Italia Editrice, 1982. L. 20,000. This work is disposed in four chapters: ( 1 ) (pp. 9-81 ) summarizing the recorded data in the various languages and language-groups not only Semitic (including Eblaite) but also Hamitic (Egyptian, Libico-Berber and Cushi- tic); (2) and (3) (pp. 83-112) summarizing the hypotheses which have in the past been advanced for explaining the problems (mainly of a syntactic order) involved; (4) (pp. 113- 30), entitled ' Nuove ipotesi ', seeks to develop further the arguments propounded in F. Aspesi, La dzettnzione del genere nel nome anttco- egtzzano e semitico (Firenze, 1977). An appendix lists in tabular wise the numeral forms already discussed in chapter i. It can be seen at once that the major part of the book is concerned with synthesizing and sum- marizing information already available, and only the short final chapter is original. This is no adverse criticism of the usefulness of the work. In view of the vast amount of ink that has been poured out on this subject, one feels that the book meets a fairly urgent need for some synthesis putting it all together in a convenient and accessible manner.</page></plain_text>
