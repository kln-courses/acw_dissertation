<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Limitations of Labels MONICA BLACKMUN VISONA T he following five papers, originally presented at the 1987 College Art As- sociation meetings in Boston for the panel "African Borderland Sculpture: Liminal Space in the Study of Style," were brought together for this issue of African Arts by Patrick R. McNaughton, the panel's organizer (p.76). Each repre- sents a valuable contribution to our un- derstanding of the nature of art and in- terethnic relationships in Africa. The cross-cultural perspective taken by the authors has not only allowed them to explore some central issues in African art, but has also raised some intriguing questions. Robin Poynor reminds us that art in Owo has been transformed throughout history in response to a vari- ety of political, religious, and aesthetic influences from neighboring areas (p.56). Barbara E. Frank proves that leatherwork cannot be studied without a knowledge of the economic and social relationships of artists, traders, and pa- trons in a multiethnic environment (p.48). Kathryn L. Green investigates the ways in which different groups respond to similar religious images (p.62), while Carol Ann Lorenz suggests that diverse uses for a single type of art may reflect basic differences in the social structures of adjoining peoples (p.70). Christopher D. Roy's findings imply that both the adoption of new art forms and the reten- tion of old ones have profound effects upon a population's sense of identity (p.40). As more and more data on African art are made available to us, it becomes appa- rent that the fluid, variegated interethnic relationships described by these scholars are the rule rather than the exception in Africa. Interaction, not isolation, seems to characterize much of the production and distribution of traditional art forms. Yet African art is still presented to the general public as if there were a repre- sentative style for each ethnic group and as if each piece were either a typical or atypical example of a single population's oeuvre. Is it possible to discuss African art in a more sophisticated, realistic manner without confusing our audi- ence? Can we devise new categories for African art - taking into account the many geographic, ethnic, functional, and ideological factors determining style -without becoming hopelessly mud- dled? As we begin to formulate new de- scriptive terms for African styles, I be- lieve we may find it helpful to consider the labels used by colleagues in Western European art. First of all, there are a good number of categories available to historians of European art that have no reference to ethnic or even to geographic boundaries. Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic, to name but a few, refer to the formal characteristics rather than to the tribal origin of styles. In fact, the term "Inter- national Style" is so useful that it can be applied to early-thirteenth-century painting as well as to modern architec- ture. Africanists also need to stress the international nature of the art they study. Formal conventions in leatherwork of the Western Sudan and the naturalism of cement figures found throughout West Africa cross national borders. The "box- stool with horns" described by Lorenz is a motif shared by several ethnic groups, and the horizontal zoomorphic helmet masks and anthropomorphic face masks researched by Green exemplify another cross-cultural art form. When art historians do describe Euro- pean art in geographical terms, they generally use historically correct ter- minology. Thus Ensor is called a Belgian artist, Memling a Flemish artist. A man- uscript is Ottonian, not German or Swiss. Unfortunately, Africanists often try to fit ancient art (such as Sao terracot- tas or Lower Niger Bronzes) into con- temporary ethnic frameworks. Moreover, they usually apply current ethnic labels to art produced over a cen- tury ago. While this is valid for well- documented, centralized societies, it is highly speculative when one is dealing with small-scale, decentralized groups. For example, in the southeastern Ivory Coast, where my own research was con- ducted, a sculptor working prior to col- onization would not have known that he was Ebrie; he would have identified himself as a member of a kinship group and intervillage alliance within the population we now call Ebrie or Kyaman. In another example, several dozen unrelated and distantly related villages in the Lagoon region have found it convenient to band together as the Aizi, but nineteenth-century artists from the area would not have recognized that label. Art historians must realize that many ethnic groups were named and "organized" by colonizers for adminis- trative convenience, and we should use regional rather than ethnic labels wher- ever these types of situations may have occurred. Finally, categories in European art refer to the art objects produced, not to the ethnic origin of the artist or patron. A painting executed by Van Eyck for an Italian merchant still qualifies as a work of the Northern Renaissance, as does the altarpiece Van der Goes painted to be displayed in Florence. English portrait painting is not considered any less British because it was influenced so strongly by foreigners like Holbein and Van Dyck. Poynor's interest in Akeredolu reminds us that individuals have similar impacts on the formation of styles in Africa, and that we need to search actively for such catalysts. Fur- thermore, if Africanists were to follow these conventions in regarding the final product, rather than the ethnicity of the artist or patron, as the determining fac- tor in assigning stylistic labels, Roy could call a mask carved in the Bwa style by a Nuna artist "Bwa" (unless he wanted to use a more imaginative label such as "central Burkinabe wooden mask style"). In my own research I should be forced to admit that a gold-covered staff finial carved in a Baule style by an Akye artist for an Anyi patron is, in the final analysis, Baule (unless I wished to say it was in the style of "Bandama-Comoe re- gion goldwork"). The habit of linking art styles to spe- cific peoples in Africa developed when scholars assumed that the study of Afri- can art was much less complex than the study of European art, when African art- ists were believed to be bound by the narrow tradition of their native villages. At the current stage of our research, however, it appears that the study of style in Africa is more complicated than we ever imagined, and that African styles are even more multifaceted than their European counterparts. Historians of African art need to find new ways to categorize and conceptualize their find- ings, for as scholars and as educators we must assimilate as well as disseminate the important information contained in works such as these five papers.
