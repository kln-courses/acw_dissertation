<plain_text><page sequence="1">Article Cecilia Eriksson and Harry Burton Origins and Biological Accumulation of Small Plastic Particles in Fur Seals from Macquarie Island One hundred and sixty four plastic particles (mean length 4.1 mm) recovered from the scats of fur seals (Arcto- cephalus spp.) on Macquarie Island were examined. Electron micrographs of 41 of the plastic particles showed that none could be identified as plastic pellet feedstock from their shapes. Commonly, such pellets are cylindrical and spherical. Instead, all the 164 plastic particles from the seal scats were angular particles of 7 colors (feedstock particles are normally opaque or white) and could be classified into 2 categories: ,) fragmented along crystal lines and likely to be the result of UV breakdown; and ii) worn by abrasion (where striations were clearly visible) into irregular shapes with rounded corners. White, brown, green, yellow and blue were the most common colors. In composition, they came from 5 polymer groups; poly- ethylene 93%, polypropylene 4%, poly(1 -CI-1 -butenylene) polychloroprene 2%, melamine-urea (phenol) (formalde- hyde) resin 0.5%, and cellulose (rope fiber) 0.5%. The larger groups are buoyant with a specific gravity less than that of seawater. These small plastic particles are formed from the breakdown of larger particles (fragments). Their origin seems to be from the breakdown of user plastics washed ashore and ground down on cobbled beaches. Certainly most particles (70%) had attained their final form by active abrasion. It is hypothesized that the plastic particles were washed out to sea and then selected by size and consumed by individuals of a pelagic fish species, Electrona subaspera, who in turn were consumed by the fur seals. Thus, the particles were accumulated both by the fish and the seals in the usual process of their feeding. INTRODUCTION The accumulation of plastic debris in the oceans and on beaches all over the world has been observed and reported for at least three decades with frequent publication from 1970 into the late 1980s (1). Amongst this marine debris, small plastic pellets from industrial feedstock especially, but also small fragments, were observed early on (2-7). Although measures were enforced to limit the input of plastic to the sea already in 1988 (8), plastic debris continued to appear in great densities in surface waters (9), on beaches (10), and even on the ocean floor (11-13). It is now recognized that much of that plastic originated from ter- restrial sites as well as from vessels, and quantities are difficult to estimate (14). It is therefore not surprising to find numbers of plastic items on geographically remote islands such as the Pitcairn Islands (15), Bird Island, South Georgia (16), New Zea- land's subantarctic islands (17, 18) and Macquarie and Heard Islands in the Southern Ocean (19, 20) and even at some beaches on the Antarctic Peninsula (21, 22). Neuston net sampling in sea-surface waters for plastics, has been carried out in coastal areas, areas highly frequented by tank- ers and fishing vessels, and in areas away from such activities. Small plastic particles were found in all these areas. While Ryan (23) reported a mean density of 3600 plastic particles km-2 on the sea surface off South Africa, Day et al. (24) found numbers up to 0.3 x 106 plastic particles km-2 in the North Pacific east of Japan. In 2001, Moore et al. (25) described a mean abundance of 0.3 x 106 and a maximum of almost 1 x 10' plastic particles km-2 in the North Pacific central gyre. As well as feedstock, it was recognized that remnants of manufactured plastic products (user plastic) found in the marine environment also result from plastic product breakdown. This breakdown probably occurs through wave action and ultraviolet light acting both at sea and with grinding from rocks and sand on beaches. This conclusion was supported by the abundance of small plastic particles, mainly fragments, being correlated with the abundance of larger plas- tic items in the sea (24, 26, 27). Also, Moore et al. (25) found that most of the plastic fragments they sampled were thin films (described as similar to the plastic used in sandwich bags), mono- filament line, and miscellaneous fragments. A large number of publications reported on plastic particles, pellets as well as fragments, of sizes &lt; 1 cm appearing in seabird digestive systems from all oceans. So far 111 (36%) species of seabirds worldwide have been found to ingest marine debris of which most is plastic (28). Some aspects of small plastic parti- cles in sea birds, i.e. number of feedstock and/or user-plastic, size, color, density, and chemical composition are well docu- mented. Plastics have been found in turtles (29-31), juvenile, and adult fish (2, 4), the Southern Ocean opah fish Lampris immaculatus (32), sea snails (5), tuna (33), and whales (34, 35), but little is known of the paths of these particles through the ma- rine ecosystem. Plastic particles were first seen in fur seal scats from Mac- quarie Island in 1990 (D. Johnson and H. Burton, unpubl. data). When studying the diet of Otarid seals at Macquarie Island, Goldsworthy et al. (36) and McMahon et al. (37) reported that they found scats, from fur seals and Hooker Sea Lions respec- tively, to contain small plastic particles ca 1 mm in diameter. The plastic particles were found in association with otoliths of the fish Electrona subaspera in all these seal species. Our study has looked further into the origin of similar small plastic parti- cles in fur seal (Arctocephalus spp.) scats on Macquarie Island with collections from 1991 and 1997. METHODS Collection of Scat Samples and Extraction of Plastic Particles Scats from the Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus tropicalis and/ or Antarctic fur seal A. gazella were collected in 2 periods, 1990/ 1991 and 1996/1997, at Secluded Beach and Goat Bay, North Head Peninsula, Macquarie Island (54?30'S 158?57'E). The beach at Secluded Bay is - 250 m long and that of Goat Bay - 50 m. Sampling was done from late November until early April while the seals were ashore in numbers sufficient to produce at least a few scats per visit to the beach. Scats were collected from between the grass tussocks (just above the high-tide zone) then frozen and later broken apart with water in a series of two sieves with mesh diameter of 1 mm and 0.5 mm mesh as described in Goldsworthy et al. (36). Thus, plastic micro-litter, &lt; 0.5 mm (14), was not retained. Plastic particles were stored dry in small plas- tic bags. Free plastic pieces were rarely observed in the tussock areas where the scats were collected; and so the inclusion of plas- 380 ?

Size and Color Measurements of Plastic Particles Size measurements were done on all plastic particles extracted from seal scats in 1996/1997 with a Sigma Scan Pro image analy- sis system. Maximum length and "maximum width" (the latter being somewhat more subjective) were determined. Thickness was not measured but was always less than the maximum width. A subjective estimate of maximum length was made by eye on samples from 1990/1991. Color was defined subjectively upon inspection by the senior author. Electron Micrographs of Plastic Particles The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was a JEOL JSM-840. The plastic particles from 1990/1991 were photographed at - 10 kVA, a low energy current, after being sputter-coated with 21 nm thickness of gold while they were held on brass stubs by dou- ble-sided adhesive tape. The time each specimen was held in the SEM chamber was kept short because the hot electron beam in high vacuum distorted the specimens after a minute. Chemical Analysis Chemical composition was determined for all plastic particles found in seal scats and also for all (no selections were made) plastic objects in flotsam collected regularly on Sandell Bay beach on Macquarie Island. The flotsam had been collected monthly during November 1998 to March 1999. Very thin sec- tions were cut from seal scat plastic particles (after they were measured) and flotsam plastic with a fine dissecting knife and analyzed by placing the fragments under an infrared microscope Figure 1.

Special note was made from the transmission data of the degree of oxidation of the plastic. The samples were subjectively graded into one of three (low, medium or high oxidation) categories. RESULTS In this paper we present data only for scat samples that contained plastic particles. A total of 164 plastic particles were found in 145 seal scats. In the year 1990/1991, the number of plastic par- ticles in the 45 scats was always 1 per scat and in the year 1996/ 1997, 85% of the 100 scat samples contained 1 particle per scat, 12% had 2 particles per scat, 2% had 3 particles per scat and 1% had 4 particles per scat. Scanning electron micrographs of 41 particles from 1990/1991 showed that 39% were fragmented along "crystal" lines. Nearly all (98%) had an irregular form and were worn by abrasion into shapes with some rounded edges (Figs 1 A, B). About one third of the particles had at least 1 sharp edge, and 70% had clearly visible wear striations from abrasion. Lengths of the plastic par- ticles extracted from seal scats were only measured in 1996/1997 and generally ranged from 2 to 5 mm (89% of 119 particles) but could be up to 30 mm long. The mean length was 4.1 mm (Fig. 2), the mean width was 1.9 mm. A subjective estimate of maxi- mum length for the 1990/1991 samples would be that they were similarly sized to the 1996/1997 particles. All particles (except one cellulose fiber) had similar relative dimensions (shapes) al- though individual circumferences were very irregular. The dis- tribution of the ratio of length/width (shape) was tightly clumped (Fig. 3). 50 Figure 2. Frequency of particle numbers in l I each 1 mm length category.

White, brown, blue, green, and yellow were the most common colors among plastic particles in seal scats. In flot- sam white, blue and green were most common and yellow and red were common. All particles from seal scats (45 particles from 1990/1991 and 119 from 1996/1997) were analyzed for chemical composition (Ta- ble 2). The particles came from 5 major poly- mer groups. Polyethylene comprised 93%, polypropylene 4%, poly(I-Cl-l-butenylene) polychloroprene 2%, melamine-urea (phenol) (formaldehyde) resin 0.5% and cellulose 0.5%. All the 163 flotsam objects collected from Sandell Bay beach in the year 1998/1999 were analyzed for chemical composition. Polyethylene comprised 48% of the objects, polypropylene 18%, polyethylene terephtha- late (PET) 11%, polystyrene 16%, casein 3.3%, polyester resin? 2.5%, polyester resin + glass fibers 3.3%, and &lt; 1% in each of polyamid resin or nylon like, polystyrene co-acrylonite co- urethane, ester resin phenol modified alkyd, polyester urethane, and PVC and polyethylene co-vinyl acetate. DISCUSSION Plastic ingestion is known in a small number of marine mam- mals but is far more commonly reported from birds (e.g. 28, 38). It is possible to have sample sizes of hundreds of specimens of birds examined in a single study (39). Sample sizes of seals are commonly much smaller. Otarid seals have been reported to be entangled in marine debris, especially plastic strapping on beaches and trawl nets (40), however ingestion of plastic is rarely reported. Goldsworthy et al. (36) and McMahon et al. (37) both found plastic particles while investigating diets of fur seals and Hooker sea-lions at Macquarie Island. All 3 species had been feeding on Electrona subaspera, which is a very numerous myctophid fish species in the region (41). Indeed, Merilees (42) has reported a mass stranding of thousands of individuals of this species on the shores of Macquarie Island. E. subaspera was by far the most numerous diet item in all fur seal scats (36). Numbers of Plastic Particles in Scats Goldsworthy et al. (36) collected 138 scat samples from fur seals on Macquarie Island in 4 months, and of these, - 4% (mean of 4 months) contained plastic with a maximum of 15% during one month. Thus, plastic particles in the scats were found regularly. This is an unexpected result for a region far distant from sources that supply large quantities of plastic. However, the number is still smaller than that of particles, 6.6 per bird, found in the North Table 2.

It seems that the birds directly ingested the plastic particles themselves. There is little possibility that the seals di- rectly ingested plastic particles with a mean size of 4 mm. A plastics concentrating stage, such as a fish, is vital in explain- ing how these particles come to be found in seal scats in such numbers. In fact Carpenter et al. (2) found, when collecting small (0.1 to 2 mm) plastic spherules in the coastal waters of New Eng- land by oblique plankton tows, identical spherules in several fish species. These fish species ranged in size between 4.6 to 327 mm and each contained one spherule per fish. Minimum esti- mates of the concentration factors of plastic particles from the fish to the seals in our study lie upwards from 22 to 160 times. These estimates are calculated assuming 4% of scats contained one plastic particle, a mean number of fish per scat was 44.4/2 (2 otoliths from each fish) and the maximum observed number of fish per scat was 319/2 as described by Goldsworthy et al. (36). These are minimum estimates because digestion of otoliths (and thus loss of otoliths from the sample) was an active proc- ess. Approximately 98% of the otoliths were eroded (36). Thus, concentration factors could be &gt; 160 and so one plastic particle could be expected in a range of 450 to 4000+ fish. The accu- mulation of plastics up the foodweb is a purely physical one. The process has the same trophic basis as the accumulation of some pesticides in marine mammals (43). For the plastics are also materials which are consumed inadvertently and are of purely human origin. Size and Shape of Plastic Particles The particles were extremely sorted in size and formed a unimodal distribution (Fig. 2) and had a shape ratio (length/maxi- mum width) that was largely constant (Fig. 3). The shape ratio range varied from 1 to 18 (fiber); but the mean ratio was 2.6 382 ?

Photo: M. Schulz. Plastic debris can be thrown up into the tussock zone. Photo: D. Slip. - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A (ovoid) (Fig. 3). These narrow ranges of particle parameters sug- gest selectivity of a precise kind. Such discrimination could be provided through consumption by a surface feeding fish whose normal diet items are of the same size range. E. subaspera is an omnivore of length up to 127 mm (44), which is the major diet item of fur seals and whose close congeneric E. carlsbergi is also an important diet item of penguins at Macquarie Island (45, 46). E. carlsbergi is known to consume copepods inter alia and migrate to the surface near dusk from a depth of 80 to 140 m (44). The diet and habits of E. subaspera are likely to be simi- lar. The size range of copepods in these waters is from 1-9 mm (47), which overlaps the size distribution of 95% of the plastic particles in the scats. It is interesting to note that in the South- ern Ocean south of Tasmania bluefin tuna have been found to contain plastic material. The diet of these tuna include myctophid species which may have themselves contained plastics prior to being eaten by the tuna (48). Abrasion, Fragmentation and Oxidation of Particles The scanning electron micrographs of the plastic particles from the scats of fur seals show 70% of the particles had clear abra- sion marks (Fig. IA). Thus, most particles had attained their fi- nal form by active abrasion. The explanation for this that oc- curs to us is that these particles were ground actively against sharp and hard surfaces such as crystals in rocks. This abrasion could have happened on active cobbled beaches or in the diges- tive tracts of the seals. We favor the first explanation as the softer otoliths in the scats, also subject to the digestive process, did not have similar abrasion marks. Apart from being abraded, 34% of the particles also had partly sharp and angular forms. The oxi- dation of all plastic particles was evident from the analysis and it is likely that ultraviolet (UV) light had played a part in pro- moting fragmentation at sea (48a, 49). Signs of crazing, chalk- ing, discoloration, and embrittlement (50), similar to what was found on plastic pellets by Gregory (51), were found in 39% of our particles. Most colors included particles with similar pro- portions of high, medium, and low oxidation rating (52). How- ever the white particles (52% of the total, Table 1 B) had many more cases of low and medium oxidation rating, compared to high (52). This suggests that either this color was more resist- ant to oxidation than the others or that the particles had been exposed for a shorter period. The first explanation is surprising as colors darker than white are reported (53) to be more resist- ant to UV degradation as the pigments can act as UV light ab- sorbers (48, 54) with the light energy then being dissipated as heat before it can contact the degradation-initiating centers of the polymers. Although low temperatures can cause embritt- lement in polymers (55) Andrady (56) showed in experiments with polymers exposed to sunlight on land and floating on cool seawater that low temperatures generally limited the degrada- tion rates. The particles in our study seemed more formed by abrasive processes than by chemical processes of polymer deg- radation. Color Distribution The colors of particles from both seals and from beach-washed flotsam were quite similar (Table 1). The approximately 10 times higher frequency of brown in particles from seal scats, compared to the colors of flotsam, is likely to be due to faecal staining. Plastic flipper tags on the rear flippers of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) on Macquarie Island were observed com- monly to be stained brown. The similarity in color distribution in particles from scats and in flotsam is consistent with the particles being selected by size at night whilst the colors were obscure to unidentifiable, but the size and outline being very clear, to a fish feeding from below the surface. The congruence in colors of these small plastic par- ticles and beach flotsam (Table 1) suggests that the particles are formed from the breakdown of the larger flotsam pieces into smaller and smaller fragments. The small particles from seal scats therefore have not originated as plastic pellet feedstock which have quite limited color frequencies (7). Comparison of Polymer Group Frequencies between Seal and Flotsam Plastics The categories of polymers found in the seal scats were essen- tially the same as those found in the beach flotsam (52). The differences were in the absence of polymers with a specific grav- ity &gt; 1.02, which is the value for seawater. While polyethylene and polypropylene were dominant in both groups, there were fewer plastic groups represented in the seal plastics (Table 2). This is evidence for the entry of plastic particles into the food- chain following a period of suspension in seawater. For an im- portant characteristic in determining their presence is likely to be specific gravity; as the "missing" plastic groups from the seal scats have specific gravities greater than seawater. The constitu- ent pieces would sink once their parent buoyant structures, which brought them to the beach, were broken up into smaller frag- ments. A good example of this effect is shown with soft-drink Ambio Vol. 32 No. 6, Sept. 2003 C Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2003 383 http://www.ambio.kva.se</page><page sequence="5">bottles made of PET. PET was found regularly on the beach as whole capped bottles but was never found in the seal scats as particles. CONCLUSIONS It is hypothesized that most small plastic particles (&lt; 10 mm) found in seal scats from Macquarie Island originated from plas- tic flotsam that had been washed out to sea after their parent materials were washed ashore and broken down on shorelines.

The particles did not originate as raw plastic feedstock pellets. Some of the particles were later consumed by individuals of a night-feeding pelagic fish, E. subaspera. Some of these individu- als, in turn, were consumed by fur seals feeding near Macquarie Island. This biological accumulation of small plastic pieces through the near-island oceanic foodweb is akin, by inadvertent consumption of anthropomorphic materials, to that of the ac- cumulation of some pesticides through other marine mammal foodwebs. 36.
