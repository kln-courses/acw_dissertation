<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSIOGNOMIC PERCEPTION This paper is an examination of the theory of Werner, Arnheim, and K6hler that there is a general type of 'physiognomic' or affective per- ception in which tertiary features predominate throughout independently of nontertiary features and which is distinct from another general type of perception, 'geometric-technical,' in which nontertiary features pre- dominate. What follows is a critical reconstruction of the central argu- ment of these writers from discussions in 'development' and anthropo- logical psychology. The points I take up are that any description of what is perceived or thought is relative to one of several possible points of view; that the meaning of 'objective/subjective' is equally dependent on this specification of 'point of view;' that there is a very general dis- tinction to be drawn between 'naive' and 'sophisticated' points of view, one of whose differentia is the presence or absence of tertiary features; that there is therefore, a completely general distinction between 'physi- ognomic' and 'geometric-technical' perception corresponding to 'naive' and 'sophisticated' points of view; that 'physiognomic' perception is distinct from 'animism,' 'anthropomorphism,' 'personification,' 'transfer- ence,' and the like; and finally, I discuss the difficulties of describing ordinary perception of relatively sophisticated societies on this theory as a 'mixture' of the two types of perception. 1. Whenever A describes what B sees or thinks there is always the danger of confusion due to A's describing what B sees from A's point of view as though that were B's point of view. Generally, a third person description is not a report of perceptual experience at all, although, unless this distinction is kept in mind, it is liable to be taken as such. This is the point of Gibson's distinction of the 'Visual World' and the 'Visual Field.' The former is described from the point of view of per- ceptual experience, the latter from a more 'objective' or 'sophisticated' point of view based on what is known or thought to be the case in- dependently of perceptual experience. Other psychologists have found it necessary to draw some such distinction as this. Donald Snygz refers to this distinction when he speaks of the phenomenologicall field' and the 'physical field.' 377</page><page sequence="2">378 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The phenomenological field is simply the world of naive immediate experience in which each individual lives, the everyday situation of self and surroundings which the unsophisticated person takes to be real.' By nativee' is meant a report of perceptual experience from that point of view as opposed to some other standard, neutral, objective, epistemo- logically or metaphysically preferred point of view. Further, for whatever purpose behavior is to be studied it must be observed from one of two distinct points of view. It may be studied objectively, as by an outside observer; or it may be studied phenomenologically, from the point of view of the behaving organism itself. The facts derived from these two points of view are non-identical and are often completely contradictory.2 In the same way Stagner and Karwoski contrast 'phenomenal field' ('the field or environment as perceived by the individual') and 'physical field'; 3 and Hadley Cantril distinguishes similarly the 'first person point of view' from the 'third person point of view.' 4 Difficulties arise when different points of view are confused in de- scriptions of what is seen. There are a great many possible points of view and a correspondingly wide variety of kinds of confusions of this sort. But the most important is that between the experiential or 'naive' point of view and any of a set of objective, neutral, standard or 'sophis- ticated' points of view; for example, the supposed difficulty of ascribing emotion and feeling terms to works of art is a confusion of this type. It is a confusion of two points of view, and the perplexity arises out of the contradiction between the corresponding descriptions of what is perceived; from a 'naive,' first person, or experiential point of view the music is sad, to take the simplest case, and from an objective, third person, 'sophisticated' point of view the music is not sad. All the writers who have dealt with this supposed problem have tacitly relied on this distinction while failing to keep it sufficiently clear, or even to acknowl- edge it explicitly. All have accepted, in other -words, that from the 'naive point of view works of art have emotion and feeling features, while rejecting this, at the same time, from another point of view. This source of confusion is similar to the ambiguity of expressions which are said to take 'intentional' objects, those which are not unambiguously 1 Syngz, Donald.

In one sense, from A's point of view, A is not looking for Jones; in another sense, from the point of view of someone else who knows that A is looking for the principal and that the principal is Jones, A is looking for Mr. Jones. Psychologists interested in the perception of children and 'primitive' peoples have become concerned with this source of confusion in a purely practical, methodological way. Werner and K6hler have diagnosed the difficulties which exist in attempts to theorize about 'pre-logical' men- tality or perception as due primarily to the tendency to describe primi- tive perception from a sophisticated, theoretical and hence alien point of view.5 This point is the key to Werner's and Khler's argument. 2. What is seen is generally believed to be 'objective' in some sense; likewise, a description of what is seen is generally meant to be 'objec- tive.' But just as what is seen and descriptions of what is seen are relative to particular points of view, so there are several senses of the 'objective/subjective' distinction relative to particular points of view. Koffka points out one ambiguity in 'subjective/objective.' We call an experience of anger subjective because it belongs to us as ours while tables and colors, which do not, are therefore called objective; 'on the other hand we call colors and sounds subjective, light and sound waves objective, because the former are dependent on organisms and the latter are not.' 6 He shows how any property in the first sense, whether sub- jective or objective, is subjective in the second sense. Whatever is per- ceived, as described from a first person, experiential point of view, is subjective in the latter theoretical, highly sophisticated point of view. There are further ambiguities as well. Tertiary features like sadness or friendliness (in another person) as well as primary and secondary proper- ties are equally objective in Koffka's first sense, although tertiary features are subjective while primary and secondary properties are objective in the sense that only the latter are verifiable in a certain way; and in the sense of dependency on the circumstances of the perceptual situation (illumination, position of the perceiver, etc.), tertiary and secondary properties are subjective and only primary properties are objective. So in diverse senses, nothing that forms a part of perceptual experience is or could be objective; only primary properties are objective, and the 5 Kohler, Wolfgang.

The latter are based on involved and fairly esoteric intellectual theories about perception, and anyone not acquainted with such theories would, and does, suppose ('naively') that the threat- ening aspect of an impending storm, the friendliness in a facial expres- sion, the hostility of a gesture and the sadness of the music (all tertiary features) were as much a part of the storm, face, behavior, and music (i.e., niiively objective in Koffka's first sense) as the colors and shapes involved. As K6hler writes, regarding tertiary features, In a certain sense such qualities of percepts are 'subjective.' As we perceive them they are functions of nervous processes; but this is true of all properties of all percepts.... Beyond any doubt they appear quite as much as properties of the world around us as, for instance, colors and smells. Phenomenally, they are objective....7 What is peculiar to the position of K6hler, Werner and Amheim is the 'elevation in status' of naive perception. As with Moore regarding nailive beliefs and Wittgenstein regarding ordinary ways of speech, these writers, among others, take seriously, scientifically, intellectually, and philosophi- cally, the experiential report of perception from the ordinary, unsophis- ticated point of view and defend it from attempts to disparage, despise or reduce it to something else. 3. Considerations of this sort have suggested the view, at least partly confirmed by extensive experimental data, that there is a perfectly general distinction between primitive perception based on a naive, first person point of view in which tertiary features are objective in Koffka's first sense, and a sophisticated type of perception based on a sophisti- cated point of view determined by various theoretical considerations, analytical interests, habits of mind, etc. in which primary and/or secon- dary qualities predominate to the exclusion of tertiary. The generality of the distinction is such that its main features would apply to the dif- ference between the perception of children and of adults as well as to the differences between the perception within relatively primitive cultures and within relatively more sophisticated cultures, and, to a lesser extent, to differences between the perception of artist and engineer. One pervasive aspect of this distinction and one which lends indepen- dent support to its generality is that the demarcation between 'subject' 7 Kbhler, op. cit., pp. 208-209.</page><page sequence="5">PHYSIOGNOMIC PERCEPTION 381 and 'object' is proportionally less strictly drawn in less sophisticated cultures than in more intellectually advanced ones, with a resultant 'internalization' of tertiary features from a more or less objective status in the relatively undifferentiated ego-object relation of more naive forms of perception and thought, to a more or less subjective status in the dif- ferentiated ego-object relation of more sophisticated forms. This notion is based on comparative studies of ego-object relations in primitives and among children with that of adults of more advanced cultures; but something of the point may be independently established simply by reflecting on the internalization of one's own feelings and emotions which results from momentarily adopting any of such intellectual habits of thought as emotional detachment, analytic introspection and self- conscious reflection. As Garvin, Ducasse and others have said, when listening unreflectively, unselfconsciously, we tend to hear the sad quality as localized in the music, external to ourselves, but a moment's reflec- tion, that is, any heightened awareness of ourselves as distinct from others listening to the music, etc., or any attempt to isolate and locate the sad-producing sensation, serves to make it sufficiently clear that the sadness is an affect of ourselves and not correctly ascribable to the music.8 4. From the considerations presented above KMhler, Werner and Arn- heim have concluded that there is a general type of perception, desig- nated 'physiognomic perception,' in which tertiary features predominate, to be found within 'primitive' cultures and among children of more advanced cultures. This type of perception is logically distinct from a second type of perception designated 'geometric-technical' which is found in more 'sophisticated' and intellectually advanced cultures. Each per- ceptual type operates on its own principles and is describable indepen- dently of the other; hence, each must be understood on its own terms. Developmentally the more sophisticated 'geometric-technical' perception arises out of the developmentally prior 'physiognomic perception.' As the perceptual needs of a child in a more sophisticated culture begin to require more sophisticated, self-reflective and analytic habits of thought, there occurs a polarization of the ego-object relation, tertiary features become largely internalized and primary and secondary properties come to predominate. Presumably the same general features characterize the history of the relatively 'sophisticated' cultures from more 'naiiive' origins. 8 Cf.

Referring to the 'dynamic apprehension' resulting from the high degree of subject-object integration in naive or primitive perceptual con- texts mentioned above, he writes, Such dynatnization of things based on the fact that the objects are predomi- nantly understood through the motor and affective attitude of the subject may lead to a particular type of perception. This mode of perception differs radi- cally from the more everyday perception in which things are known according to their 'geometrictechnical,' matter-of-fact qualities as it were.9 Since to the average Western adult the principal area remaining where the former type of perception occurs is the detection of facial features and gestures, Werner has called this mode of perception 'physiognomic perception.' Physiognomic perception, he says, plays a larger part in so-called primitive cultures, and among children and artists than with the average educated Western adult where 'geometric-technical' percep- tion is the rule. Aside from the artist who presents special problems, being himself an 'educated Western adult,' which I will consider later, it should not be supposed that Werner et al. imagine the primitive to be an 'esthete in the sense in which this implies a detached or reflective rather than practical stance. On the contrary, the dynamic feature of 'physiognomic perception' is explicitly related to the attitude of action (what Werner calls the 'motor attitude') rather than reflection.1l And Arnheims writes, The priority of physiognomic properties should not come as a surprise. Our senses are not self-contained recording devices operating for their own sake. They have been developed by the organism as an aid in properly reacting to the environment. The organism is primarily interested in the forces that are active around it - their place, strength, direction. Hostility and friendliness are attributes of forces.11 In physiognomic perception, then, a dark cloud appears threatening, the ocean in a gale is wild and a mountain may be majestic or forbidding.12 It should be clear how different is this type of perception from that of our own everyday perception.'3 And K6hler even argues that scien- tific theories of the seventeenth century have become a part of our perception. 14 But it is important to avoid exaggerating the extent to 9 Werner, op. cit., p. 69. 10 Cf.

Werner's hypothesis is that there are relatively independent develop- mental levels of perception each with its own formal structure the most general features of which, in the case of 'primitive' levels, he claims can be found in the perception of a child, an artist, 'primitives,' psychotics, and in dreams and certain unusual experiences of Western adults as are produced by drugs. From primitive to sophisticated is not, then, a linear progression but a sequence of plateaus or levels each with a distinctive organization. The more advanced levels do not improve upon or alter the structure of the less advanced levels, but effect a complete reorgani- zation. The most pervasive feature of physiognomic perception is its, from our point of view, radical method of classification, bringing together as perceptually similar what are to our ordinary ways of thinking altogether different sorts of things. This extensive 'category mistake' Werner calls 'syncretism,' and his discussion of this feature of physiognomic percep- tion clearly forms the most interesting sections of his book. Syncretism refers primarily to the breakdown and synthesis of categories of subject (ego) and object, an emotional and affective classification which ignores the distinctions we most frequently insist upon between animate and ianimate objects. As Arnheim says, But in terms of expressive qualities, the character of a given person may resemble that of a particular tree more closely than that of another person-, This classification will result in both a greater specification of tertiary traits and a relative indeterminacy in regard to shape and color words. A primitive culture may have a huge variety of expressions to describe ways of walking and yet only one expression for an entire range of roundish or voluminous objects, motions or shapes.'7 Syncretism includes not only the 'fusion' of subject and object but 'synaesthesia,' the fusion of objects of what we should consider distinct senses (visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.), as when, in one of Werner's 15 Cf. Arnheim, op. cit., p. 262. 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid., pp. 262, 267.</page><page sequence="8">384 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH numerous examples, a child refers to the 'gold and silver striking of the hour' or the fog as 'whispering.' 18 Equally undifferentiated is the apprehension of visual form and the recognition of what we should regard as rather abstract, nonvisual properties such as power, influence, capacity, fertility, intelligence. In the syncretism of physiognomic perception such abstract characters are treated visually, auditorily, etc. In ancient Egypt, Justice or Equity is always represented concretely, whether as residing in the king's mouth, as a goddess, or as a kind of food for the gods offered to them daily in the image of the goddess. In what Werner calls the primitive 'emotional perspective' he shows how Brazilian Indians representing a jaguar attacking a tapir draw the jaguar (which is about a third again as large as a tapir) as being four times the size of the tapir. Similarly Bushmen represent themselves as giants and their enemies as dwarfs. Here notions of strength, power, and skill are assimilated to the visual character of relative size.19 This fusion of abstract meaning with sensible imagery approaches very nearly the use of imagery in the art, especially the poetry, of relatively advanced cultures. Generally, primitive notions of space, time and causality are syncretic. Space and time in primitive conceptions, Werner says, are not indepen- dent of particular objects which act therein; consequently, what are from our point of view equal amounts of space and time are not physiogno- mically equal or homogeneous, but differ considerably according to the events and objects which took place therein. 20 Space may be divided into sections which correspond to the location of various tribes, and these spaces differ as the tribes do. Similarly, the passage of time is made up of heterogeneous units according to the character of events or period therein. Our own notions of space and time are not entirely divorced from this syncretic fusion with other 'connotations.' In the reconstruction of our own past lives time is generally represented, not 'smoothly,' homogeneously, as we believe time to be, but in 'lumps' of important events. Likewise, our ideas of distance may be in terms of travel facilities. An interesting example of syncretism is the primitive notion of caus- ality, which K6hler calls 'causation by transmission,' in which the rela- tion between cause and effect is based on concrete perceptual similarities, e.g., in one tribe lizards' tongues are fed to infants with the idea of transmitting the agility of the lizard's tongue to that of the child.

It is extremely important in understanding this account of 'physiog- nomic perception' to distinguish it clearly from other explanations of primitive perception, such as 'anthropomorphism,' 'animism,' 'personifi- cation,' 'empathetic projection,' 'transference,' and the like, to which, however superficially similar, it is diametrically opposed. All such expla- nations amount to a characterization of physiognomy as a branch or part of, or, more properly a distortion or perversion of, nonphysiognomic perception. They assume, in other words, the logical, epistemological or metaphysical priority of the 'physical object' and 'physical object' properties and seek to explain tertiary features from the point of view appropriate to primary and secondary quality. Arnheim, opposing this, says, The fact that nonhuman objects have genuine physiognomic properties has been concealed by the popular assumption that they are merely dressed up with human expression by an illusory 'pathetic fallacy,' by empathy, anthro- pomorphism, primitive animism. But if expression is an inherent characteristic of perceptual patterns, its manifestations in the human figure are but a special case of a more general phenomenon. The comparison of an object's expression with a human state of mind is a secondary process.22 The theory based on empathetic projection assumes a sophisticated point of view in which ego-object are polarized, and tertiary quality is inter- nalized to the status of inner sensations of the perceiving subject. This stance, because of a supposed epistemological or metaphysical priority, is assumed to be developmentally prior, so that the objective localization of tertiary features is said to proceed from a contrary subjective location. And it is to this assumed circumstance that the theory of empathetic projection is directed and the explanation proffered perforce in terms of 'reading' subjective features 'into' objective states of affairs. Arnheim's point, on the contrary, is that the perception of tertiary features proceeds from a developmentally prior point of view in which there is a relatively high integration of subject and object such that the objective localization of tertiary features appears immediate and unavoidable. As H. and H. A. Frankfort say, 21 K6hler, op. cit., p. 218. Cf. Frankfort, H., Frankfort H. A., Wilson, John A., and Jacobsen, Thorkild, Before Philosophy.

Primitive man does not know an inanimate world. For this very reason he does not 'personify' inanimate phenomena, nor does he fill an empty world with ghosts of the dead, as 'animism' would have us believe. The world appears to primitive man neither inanimate nor empty but redundant with life.23 Werner argues that not only is physiognomic perception independent of such secondary phenomena as personification, anthropomorphism, etc., but that these phenomena would be impossible except on the basis of a primitive physiognomic perception. Assuming we can read subjective characters into objective states of affairs, how does this take place? What do we read into what? On what basis do we expect other people to read the same characters into the same things? By presenting an altogether arbitrary relation between the tertiary quality and the external object 'personification' and the like are unable to account for the tertiary qualities we actually seem, at least, to perceive and refer to. On any such account, in other words, if taken with full seriousness, anything could be read into anything else, and any discussion of physiognomic features should utterly have lost all point. As a matter of fact, however, there does seem to be some basis upon which personification, etc., proceed and which gives sense to such descriptions. Aside from the logical difficulties involved in explanations in terms of 'personification,' 'animism,' and the like, primitive thought and per- ception as a matter of fact seem quite unlike paradigm cases of personi- fication and animism. Werner notes that personification involves treating objects in a 'social fashion,' 24 that is, as people, which is generally alien to the response of primitive peoples. An older child may name sticks or pillows and treat them as people, but this is different from a child's fear of the dark. It is only because we first assume that physiognomy can only characterize people that we assume the perception of physi- ognomy in inanimate objects to be personification. KUhler makes the same point in regard to the concept of 'animism.' Many primitive languages have a notion of a dynamic power inherent in things, manaa' in Melanesia, 'maxpe' for the Crow Indians, 'mjomm' among West African tribes, etc., which some anthropologists have regarded as an 'animistic' notion. But 'animism,' as K6hler points out, presupposes something like a soul in a Cartesian or supernatural sense, a notion far more sophisticated than is reasonable to impute to these 23 Frankfort, op. cit., p. 14. 24 Werer, op. cit., p. 78.</page><page sequence="11">PHYSIOGNOMIC PERCEPTION 387 peoples.25 He says that 'mana' need be no more 'supernatural' than the 'heaviness,' 'hardness,' or 'elasticity' of objects in an experiential sense, thus drawing attention to features of our ordinary perception with which the primitive notion of 'mana' is perhaps better compared than with 'animism.' The ordinary view of gravity and of forces and energies in general conveys something of this primitive notion of a power or dy- namism inherent in things and worthy of respect.26 The confusion mentioned earlier of describing A's perception from B's point of view as though that were A's point of view, should not be con- fused with a description simply of A's perception from B's point of view, which, in so far as B's point of view is presumed to be more 'objective,' is generally part of the point or purpose of scientific investigations in psychology. The explanation of psychological phenomena from alien points of view is frequently justified on the grounds that being scientists or scholars we can only approach the subject from that point of view and, indeed, are only interested in it from that point of view. But even if this is not a confusion or mistake, it ultimately and in the extreme contradicts the point and interest in such investigations. It seems inherent in our understanding of people, whether in anthropology, psychology, history, sociology, etc. that in order to make fully comprehensible what people do in any of these contexts, it is essential, ultimately, to attain some understanding from the point of view of the people under investi- gation. 6. The enormous complexity of our ordinary perception in terms of 'physiognomic' and 'geometric-technical' perception has already been suggested. There are elements of both types of perception, surely in ordinary perception, but in what way are they mixed? Is the perception of the man on the street identical with that of an engineer qua engineer, and if not, how does it differ? Is the perception of an artist identical with that of a child or a primitive, and if not, how does it differ? In describing perception from a naive point of view must a scientist adopt the perspective of a child or a primitive; is this even possible, and if so, how? In the first place ordinary perception is a mixture in the sense that there occur relatively pure cases of each type of perception. But the majority of cases of ordinary perception are probably of neither type in 25 Kbhler, op. cit., p. 213. Cf. Smith and Dale in The Ida-speaking People of Northern Rhodesia and H. and H. A. Frankfort in Before Philosophy who distin- guish sharply primitive thought from such platonizing distinctions as soul and body or magic and reality. 28 Cf.

It is possible to switch from one point of view to another, from a relatively naive, physiognoomic perspective to a more reflective, sophisticated point of view, and this conversion alters what is seen, not only from physiognomic to geometric-technical, but alters the character of what is perceived within either of these perspectives. This complicates the case considerably. In ordinary perception it is possible, as critics of phenomenalism and structuralism psychology have pointed out, to 'reduce' naive perception to a more sophisticated perception, and this is often regarded, not as an alteration of perceptual aspects, but as a correction of the original. This attitude of correction would not be present in the perception of someone who simply never saw anthing but colors and shapes. As a correction the colors and shapes are presented as what the sadness, friendliness, hostility, etc. 'really are.' This involves a confusion of points of view not merely on the semantic level, but on a perceptual level as well. As in all forms of reductionism the existence of the first term is denied, while at the same time it is accepted in the sense that it is identified with the second term. This represents a type of case in ordinary perception which, although it falls more on the side of 'geometric-technical,' is not simply a case of such. On the other hand one can switch from a more sophisticated percep- tion to a more naive one such that the character of the latter is affected by the transition from the former, creating a difference, e.g., between the practical attitude of the primitive in physiognomic perception as opposed to the relatively detached and reflective attitude of the artist and art appreciator. Where 'empathetic projection' has been offered not simply as an explanation for aesthetic experience in general, but as a description of a limited and peculiar kind of experience, it represents a penetrating, though misleading, characterization of this phenomenon of shifting from a more sophisticated to a more naive perception. Baudelaire, for example, writes, The eye fixes itself on a tree, harmoniously swayed by the wind; in a few seconds that which in the brain of the poet would be only a completely natural simile becomes a fact. In the tree one's passions, longing, or melan- choly come to life.27 This experience, which clearly falls on the side of physiognomic percep- tion, is the experience of something unusual or even 'unreal' in a sense which serves to differentiate it from, say, the case of the infant's gaze at the same tree. Both this experience of 'projecting' and that of 'cor- recting' would be alien to the child or primitive or to 'physiognomy- blind' persons. 27 In Ibid., p. 82.</page><page sequence="13">PHYSIOGNOMIC PERCEPTION 389 Thus the perception of the 'average Western adult' even when more or less physiognomic is generally mediated in some way by geometric- technical perception which differentiates his perception from that of a child or a primitive, a difference Werner et al. are not always careful to observe. Nor can the anthropologist or child psychologist simply come to have the perception of a primitive or a child. The same applies to the artist. However like naive or primitive perception, the artist's per- ception cannot be equated with such. The 'Western adult' artist, with his motive to produce a work of art, his training in highly sophisticated techniques and his general education in the sophisticated, reflective tradition of his contemporaries, approaches canvas or musical composi- tion from a very different point of view than the primitive or child. However we are to finally characterize this difference we must at least acknowledge it. If we do not, we are apt to fall prey to the 'analytic dilemma,' viz., that if we do not acknowledge some middle ground between the extremes of spontaneous physiognomic perception of the infant on the one hand and analytic intellectualization of the adult on the other, then we seem forced to the horns of a dilemma, either to be a child and give up philosophizing or theorizing about primitive per- ception, or become a theorist and give up the child's point of view. On the other hand, important as these differences are, in the end they may not greatly affect Werner and Kbhler's main point that, whatever the differences between child, primitive, artist, etc., the formal or struc- tural features of their perception is the same. This is the point of an artist's wish to be child-like, not to be a child. Syncretism as the 'logic' of a kind of perception would seem to characterize much of sophisticated Western art no less than primitive art and perception - despite differ- ences in motive, deliberation, attitude, background, etc. If Werner, Kohler and Arnheim limit their thesis to this position, it seems sound; the difficulty is that they have not sufficiently recognized the ambiguity of their position in this respect and have consequently not made it clear in which of various possible ways we are to understand it. As a result, it suggests an oversimplified view of the ordinary perception of the 'educated Western adult.' This complexity of ordinary perception, with its similarity to physi- ognomic perception with respect to formal or 'logical' features and with its differences from physiognomic perception with respect to the context, attitude, motive and spontaneity in which they occur, will affect the status of Werner's position - the kind of claim he can reasonably make about 'physiognomic perception.' Now, in order to get clearer about the more 'sophisticated' forms of 'naive' perception in our ordinary percep- tion, we need to consider again the 'analytic dilemma.'
