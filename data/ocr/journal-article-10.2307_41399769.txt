By Harold Bloom. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976. 293 pp. ÍII-95- That a text is "undecidable" or "unreadable" (rather than plurisig- nificant or inexhaustible) is one of those disturbing notions of the nouvelle critique that divides the vanguard from the old guard. The vanguard has now been imported piecemeal from France to the United States, or at least to New Haven, and the whole issue of the American's transplanted and "homemade" culture, once bandied in the impolite salons of literary gossip, is being repeated in the marginal dialogues of the academy of fine ideas. Or rather, it has forced the academy into predictable retreat, as literary criticism coopts philosophy and the human sciences and repeatedly raises the specter of the irrational in the midst of intellectual gentility. Of all the American vanguard, none has been so disruptive as Harold Bloom, who has performed an astonishing de-tour de force by creating what I will call the "unreviewable" essay. Meaning only that Bloom has reinvented the genre, revealing at last the vast extravagance of writing, that writing has always been the "return of the repressed." Ironically, his assertive- ness has fated Bloom, a "man without a handle" as the elder Henry James called Emerson, to be the academy scapegoat for the very kind of unregenerate thinking he so passionately resists. The irration- ality of Bloom may be our last desperate defense of the privileged concept of "poetry." If Bloom is "unreviewable," then, it is not because he perpetrates, to use the Jamesian phrase many of his critics would prefer, a "blooming, buzzing confusion," but because he refuses the niceties of critical discourse. He is not a systematic critic, but a parodist of system, the poet as rhetorician. Bloom's provocative, conflictual, ag- gressive criticism- his unbridled assaults on the old formalist and humanist criticism, and his unrestrained tendency to underwrite his [989]</page><page sequence="2">990 THE GEORGIA REVIEW own argument by a catalogue of references, each cautiously qualified, to the critical "school" at Yale- has made him an exile from the schools of literary manners. His own excesses have provoked anxiety in the genteel institutions and hysteria in the respectable journals. Where Bloom is mentioned, hostility has become the norm of critical discourse- as witness a recent commentator in the Hudson Review who found a mere reference to Bloom in the book under consideration the irritant for a tirade on critical "vulgarity"; or the author of the summary essay in a recent issue of New Literary History , which included no essay by Bloom nor any significant references to him, who nevertheless delivered himself of a few paragraphs on the scan- dalous Americanization of French thought. Bloom may be "uncanny," as Hillis Miller would say, but he is not Derrida nor even "very like" him. Thus Bloom remains "unread," an aberrant example of what Warner Berthoff calls the "nouvelle vague of system-prepensive criticism which has been flowing from Europe to the accommodating American shore. . . ." But isn't Bloom really the very opposite? Doesn't he recognize that accommodation is a rhetoric of defense, a systematic displacement of system into poetry? And isn't Bloom, after all, the mirror, with its evident distortion, held up to French criticism- which twin, by a double reflection, reveals the superfi- ciality of American criticism? Like Grusha of John Hollander's poème-à-clé , Reflections on Espionage , Bloom has been reporting to us of late from "observation's jail," the belatedly discovered prison-house of language which his American training had convinced him was once god's instrumental plenty. He has addressed his underground report in a code that exposes the old codes. But like Hollander's agents, he only finds himself more enthralled by the system. Bloom has been touched by European thought, but not enchanted by it. (Geoffrey Hartman wincingly reflects that contemporary Paris has pushed Mallarmé's crisis over the edge, by tampering with prose.) As Hollander's Cup- cake reports to Grusha: " We were warned in/ Training, I remember, about absorption/ In the observed image which might as well be/ In a mirror." Bloom has performed for us, then, a critic's stade du miroir , and may very well have turned us all into his Other. Accepting or rejecting Bloom's criticism is no longer an option- his work has become the stereopticon of our cave, that is, our inescapable library. Whatever else one says of recent continental thought, it has raised and reinserted into discourse the " double séance " of discourse itself, the double sense of the critical operation which like an indeterminacy principle complicates the criticism, refracts it, interposes itself between the text and the reader. It has broken the immediateness of the text, or revealed it always to have been bottomless, made up of "little lower layers." It has erased the margins of "literature" as a distinct</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 991 and privileged form of language, and has therefore deregulated the thinking of primary and secondary texts, imaginative and interpre- tative discourse. Bloom is not at all certain that this interruption of the old paradigm is desirable, but like original sin, once it has been thought it continues to produce extraordinary images. It can only be resisted or transumed, not denied. So that Bloom's disturbing performances of late can only be understood as re-stagings of an inevitable and necessary play- the revenge of self-consciousness. Must I, as Stevens' uncle asked, uncrumple this much crumpled thing? Beginning with The Anxiety of Influence (1973), a book the more startling for being without precedent in its doubling of the historical argument that nothing is without precedent, nor without accident- beginning with Anxiety , Harold Bloom has rushed upon us with three (or is it four?) successor texts: A Map of Misreading (1975) and the two books at hand. It is wrong, I think, to call them a tetralogy, as publishers do, since they do not comprise a four-part harmony of a theory without remainder. Indeed, the re- lations of these texts are already prefigured in the very notion of "revisionary ratios" they purport to explore. There is a certain irony (dare one say, in this context, a "play" of blindness) in a text which at the same moment revises and amplifies the scheme of its predecessor, in an effort to overcome the limits of that scheme yet reject other criticisms of those limits. Bloom's combativeness with rival theories reduplicates his theory of the battle of the books, the struggle of a text for its own identity, conducted in the double awareness that it is always implicated in its other, that it is always belated (as criticism),' always both filiated to and disaffiliated from a "poetic" text that is itself only an interpretation or misprision of another "poetic" text. In this very special sense, Bloom performs an engaged criticism, though the engagement remains within a special, valorized field of textuality called "poetry." Bloom's conflictual stance, how- ever, has the parodie effect of displacing the very privilege of poetry that he would protect- that he so aggressively defends against the attacks of deconstruction on the one hand and the timorous moralisms of humanistic and formalist criticism on the other. In refusing "poetry" its conventional appeal to presence, in making it a form of rhetoricity, Bloom nevertheless claims that it is primordial significant form. For him criticism, which is the rhetoric of rhetoric, returns like the repressed to overthrow the demythologizing discourse of the human sciences. Why, then, is Bloom under attack? Especially since his is the last, belated defense of what used to be called the humanities. Cer- tainly he is the last Romantic, the last proponent of the "self," the last archivist of the wearying struggle for "identity." Perhaps it is because he has given away so much to the opposition that his last</page><page sequence="4">992 THE GEORGIA REVIEW line of defense is also a form (even a parody) of the via negativa . To take his stand, Bloom has had to fracture the old edifices (edifice complexes! ) of humanistic discourse, and to rebuild from the outside in. After The Anxiety of Influence one can no longer return to the thinking of priority silently inscribed in the old critical paradigms. We can no longer forget that a vulgar theory of historical priority (thus influence) functioned as the unacknowledged legislator of canon formation, tradition, and therefore critical discourse. Bloom proves conclusively that such New Critical formulations as the "intentional fallacy" not only did not confront the question of priority and alterity in texts but in fact repressed the question. Anxiety raises the question again, and re-marks it. Not, however, with the rigorous questioning of a Derrida or a de Man- but by a curious twist of rhetoric, by turning rhetoricity upon itself and thus, in de Man's terms, reweaving the contradictory or alogical history of rhetoric- as-trope and rhetoric-as-persuasion. Bloom's effort to overcome what de Man calls the aporia between two views of language, two senses of rhetoric, has stunned critics who are accustomed to making a more modest choice between the two. Similarly, Bloom's heuristic appropriation of psychoanalysis has dared a similar aporia , refusing on the one hand the American Freud with its biological, genetic, and clinical foundation and its belief in ego formation, and on the other resisting the full thrust of French Freud with its emphasis on symbolic staging and the linguistic problematic. Characteristically, Bloom nearly always situates himself in the absurd "between" of any systematic formulation, only to construct there his own Tinguely-like device, a vast mechanism that would overthrow critical entropy by building into it a reversal of its own reversals. The six "revisionary ratios" of Anxiety are by this time infamous examples, both to Bloom's acolytes and antagonists, of the extravagance of vanguard criticism. Bloom argues, however, that his extra-vagance simply repeats the wandering or indirect movement of all trope, the movement of repetition and difference that gives all texts (poems which repeat, by interpretive re-writing, other poems; criticism which repeats this interpretation) a history and allows us to mark the "accent(s) of deviation" by which we play out an illusory game of identity within the prison-house of intertextuality. Bloom's inaugural set of tropes offends, it seems, not so much because it is arcane as because of its odd tesselation of two supposedly discrete sciences. His tropaic system, later expanded into a "map," is a mosaic (a tessera including as one of its terms, tessera) of confabulated rhetorical terms, psychoanalytic, poetic, and theological figures, fragments of old systems already turned from themselves, or rather, turned from contexts in which they once appeared orderly and logical. His termi- nology first appears as a bizarre transformation of rhetoric into a</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 993 private language, a system which he "corrects" in A Map of Misreading by acknowledging that each of his figures has a near equivalent in classical rhetoric, but an equivalent which is nonetheless equivocal. Bloom's first system of terms, then, reduplicates and predicates the system- which, as Hillis Miller has said, becomes a labyrinth, every repetition of the system amplifying and complicating it rather than giving us a definitive reading and thus a "way out." Moreover, Bloom's terms are appropriated from a library of diverse and unreconcilable texts rather than from some authoritative book of rhetoric. The appropriation likewise reduplicates the overthrow of sources. Clinamen (or "swerve") is expropriated from Lucretius's theory of atoms and turned into a metaphor of metaphor; tessera ("completion and antithesis") derives from ancient mystery cults so that it retains only traces of its modern sense, of the mosaic or reticulation of contiguous differences; and so on. None of the terms is properly rhetorical, though in A Map of Misreading (as an anti- thetical reading by Paul de Man reputedly showed Bloom) they can be in turn reticulated with classical rhetoric: thus tessera and synecdoche are parallel. But the point, of course, lies in the strength (one of Bloom's key terms) of the appropriation, the necessary misreading, the mosaic which cannot be a model or map of any previous book and which must resist any future model or map. To construct a modern rhetoric out of the debris of a heterogeneous and sometimes arcane knowledge is to play the bricoleur, the modern figure of the always belated original. The signature of the new system is its excess, its flaunting of contrivance, its parodistic overthrow of the fictions of systematic criticism. The whole of Anxiety is an appropriation by expropriation: of Freud, of psychoanalysis to psyche-analytics. It is itself a model of exclusions, and while both American Freudians and French Freudians are justified in protesting its misprision of Freud, they are too easily caught in a trap that Bloom's appropriation triggers, a claim of exclusive Tightness of their own interpretation. Nevertheless, this early ex/appropriation of Freud was, as Geoffrey Hartman reminded his colleague in Diacritics (Spring, 1974), astonishingly literal, and confined to only "one strain of Freud's thinking," the Oedipal situa- tion. It almost wholly ignored the linguistic problematics that Lacan in one sense and Derrida in another had already uncovered in Freud. Bloom's "supermimetic" theory of poetry, as a complex play upon the simultaneously real and figurative event of the "primal scene," represses or ignores the challenge of Derrida's "scene of writing," a rigorous anti-mimetic theory of language uncovered in Freud. What is interesting, however, is not the limits of Bloom's blindness here, but his capacity to reverse the limits by elaboration, by a double blindness to reveal the double-bind. A Map of Misreading appears</page><page sequence="6">994 THE GEORGIA REVIEW to counter, to answer by turning the question of, de Man and Derrida. It counterposes against the "scene of writing" a figurai "event" that Bloom calls the "scene of instruction." But this only means that the "primal scene" of the earlier interpretation is turned into a primal figurai moment. Bloom answers Hartman by transuming Derrida, by turning deconstruction back into a psychodrama. He superimposes his theory of precursors, of fathers and sons, a diachronic history, upon a theory of contemporaries, of strong siblings or enemy twins, a synchronic myth. Bloom's map becomes at the same time a structuralist machine and a parody of structuralism. Admitting the linguistic problematics ig- nored by his earlier theory, recognizing the affiliation of his own terms with classical rhetoric, Bloom set out to "map" not only poetry but modern grammatology, a move which if deftly performed would make poetry "map" grammatology, turning the map into a new "rhetoric" which in the same triumphant gesture would acknowledge Derridean " écriture " and overthrow (misread) it into a philosophical misunderstanding of rhetoric. Bloom's uncovering of the "scene of instruction" is a refusal of the beginning that has all the nihilistic implications of Derrida's or Nietzsche's; yet at the same time it inaugurates a new "grounding" of man in language, a new grounding of the "self" (strong), will, psyche as the irreducible names of the primordial "forces" traced in all trope. Accepting all the implications of "scene" and "staging," Bloom strategically forgets the earlier genetic implications of "primal scene." He generates a "map" instead of a myth, though as structuralist interpretation has revealed, this almost inevitably has to be a myth of a myth. Bloom's map allows him to overcome the infinite regression built into his earlier theory, in which anxiety could only be relieved by nostalgia and entropy. The "scene of instruction" allowed Bloom to repress, at least conditionally, the enervating theory of belatedness, and to begin to reconceive poetics in a modified affirmative mode, but only by hanging on to a hollowed-out figurai notion of the "self." Bloom's "map" turns up again as a structural and referential frame to Poetry and Repression , reminding us of the repetitious aggregation of the two earlier books and Kabbalah. Where Anxiety had woven Freud and Kierkegaard, among others, upon an autodidacťs rhetoric, Map produced a full taxonomy, paralleling confabulated and classical rhetoric with a system of tropes drawn respectively from poetry and psychoanalysis. Moreover, Map introduces the Lurianic cabala as a kind of precursor of Freud, and sets the stage for yet another series of rhetorical terms and an interpretation, in Kabbalah and Criticism, of cabala as a diacritical tradition of interpretation. In Poetry and Repression , the "map" has amplified six categories into a set of twenty-four, and added a dialectical sub-set (a three-fold reversible</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 995 movement of "limitation/substitution/representation") which is pre- sumed to account for the interchanges and displacements between any of the twelve prescribed pairs of the "map": thus this dialectic governs the movement between irony /synecdoche or metonymy/ hyperbole or metaphor /metalepsis in the rhetorical sequence; and be- tween clinamen/tessera, etc., in the revisionary ratios; and between the images of "presence and absence" and the images of "part for whole or whole for part" in the poetic category; and so on. The taxonomy, in short, is characterized by redundancy and excess, and while it may be called a machine which produces demonstrable and startling results in practical criticism, it can only be an errant meta- phor of the machine. It will not produce for anyone else, avatar or epigone, without entrapping the imitator. Moreover, the "map" tran- scribes the figures so meticulously appropriated from the cabalistic tradition into a dialectic (limitation/substitution/representation), re- vealing once again that appropriation depends on a deliberately eccentric "reading" of the tradition. No wonder the "map" produces vertigo, followed by anguished hostility. It simultaneously excludes and entraps, turns imitators into slavish sons or antagonists into exiles of reason. Bloom's strategy, it seems to me, is as much a repetition of his theory of defense or repression, directed against rival systems, as it is a passionately committed effort to produce a system. It is no less a demonstration that all criticism is poetic, even at its most prosaic, literal, humble, and austere, just as all poetry is, in effect, critical. (Thus Bloom admits the Derrida/de Man position that there is no ontological difference between poetic and philosophical language and therefore that critical interpretation based on metaphysical principles- of language as the exterior of sens or truth, or the text as a vehicle of meaning- is false both to philosophy and to literature.) But if Bloom demonstrates what, upon reflection, no thoughtful man can deny, but what most critics silently ignore out of the need for a literature of intrinsic value to justify their belated enterprise, Bloom is not at all sure he likes the consequences. His map is a systematic effort to defuse the systematics of deconstruction, and to recover, as in his earlier reliance on the Romantic concepts of the "daemonic" and the "sublime," the "literary" force Freud called the "uncanny," which rationalist or formalist criticism has always repressed in its efforts to "take hold of' literature. Bloom's revisionary map, then, is quite deliberately a defense mechanism against the chaos of modernist criticism. Hence its own apparent madness. It is no less revisionary in the other rhetorical sense, however: as a persuasive effort to disrupt the paradigms that have produced the fragmentation. Beyond its usefulness for practical criticism- to repeat, it may be a productive instrument for Bloom</page><page sequence="8">99&lt;5 THE GEORGIA REVIEW but it is a labyrinth for his epigones- the "map" incorporated the double sense of rhetoric which, according to de Man, inhabits all discourse. Bloom's study of poetry as rhetoric (poetry as trope) or criticism as rhetoric (a mapping of tropes) is itself a rhetorical (persuasive) attempt to displace the Renaissance model of the autotelic lyric with the Romantic model of the "quest-romance," the poem of presence with the poem as praxis, poem as symbol with poem as "act of the mind." But one must recall here that he is also engaged in an historical argument, an effort to overcome what he must consider a radical misinterpretation- since the Renaissance model is, after all, a modernist appropriation, directed against a certain interpretation of Romanticism as natural supernaturalism and the plenitude of self. Bloom's acknowledged concern with canon-forma- tion and with literary history as a problem of intertextuality involves him, then, in the enervating role of antagonist, in the sibling rivalry with every other modernist position, including his own formative criticism. The more his criticism augurs defeat, the more passionately it revises itself in defending its region of self-identity. Ironically, a "map" presumes to be a universal system, or at least a useful guide to a common need for an itinerary through different points of view. Can one "map" the question of (the quest for) identity? The labor of psychoanalysis (American or French) and the labor of criticism (American or French) move in the chiasmus of this already mythical crossing, so readily apparent as the Oedipal signature. Bloom, after all, is accountable to his fathers- the academic ones like Northrop Frye, Walter Jackson Bate, Meyer Abrams- in a way that makes him the antagonist of brothers- de Man, Derrida, and Hartman. (If his theory of poetry anticipates the son's defeat, his criticism asserts just the opposite.) We should not speculate too much beyond this familial constellation, even if Bloom's criticism is a renewal of the age-old discourse (or diaspora) between Hebrew and Hellene. What offends his present antagonists, apparently, is that he insists on high- lighting the offense of criticism- that it has always been a muddlesome repetition of "mythologicals," a literary form. Bloom's rhetorical theory of poetry-as-trope, then, is in conflict with his rhetorical practice of criticism-as-persuasion. The repeated self-references to the "school" at Yale highlights this aporia in one way. Bloom's system, which must produce a new canon of criticism in line with the true canon of poetry, only barely conceals the exclusively contemporary or sibling competitiveness of his argument. The authoritative texts of interpretation to which he heuristically appeals as precursors- the Lurianic cabala, Vico, Freud, Emerson, Nietzsche, and Kenneth Burke- repeat the chronology of his poetic canon- centered in the Miltonic transcription of the great sacred and mythological texts, and moving through the revisions and resistances</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 997 of the great Romantics to Tennyson and Browning, then on through Yeats and Stevens to the contemporaries Ammons and Ashbery. His "tradition" even allows him to accentuate the different strains of national literatures, as in the American and English lines of Romanti- cism. But while the system as a whole supports such genealogies, it is affiliated very closely with rival systems (particularly with the contemporary practice of deconstruction) which deny such inter- pretative filiations. In other words, Bloom's poemomachia is a regressive theory of power and authority, a history of entropy or poetic defeat. But his theory of interpretation (no less a theory of belatedness and a struggle for identity) anticipates the triumph of the "strong" reading that is barely allowed his "strong" modern poet. Recognizing this apparent contradiction, Bloom must attempt to construct a genealogy of interpretation that will diffuse the power and authority of his contemporary rivals, who deny him this history and thus his critical mise en scène . He must play again the exiled son and admit his own belatedness; in Poetry and Repression he identifies with the arch rhetorician and exile, Satan of Paradise Lost . But it is only a rhetorical gesture, directed at enemy brothers. Poetry has a history or genealogy, he seems to say; but criticism is strictly contemporary. In A Map of Misreading, , this confrontation of contemporaries took the form of rhetorical introjection (identification) / projection (expul- sion), directed against Derrida's and de Man's positions, though the argument was couched in high praise for their strength. In that text, the arraignment of Emerson against Nietzsche recapitulated the modern opposition of Bloom to de Man/Derrida. And the argument often took the form of asserting willfully his own choice: "I follow Emerson, as against Nietzsche, in declining to make of de-mystification the principle end of dialectical thought in criticism." Or by argument ad hominem , as for instance his assertion, made in the face of Derrida's rigorously argued text on Freud's "scene of writing," that Freud is more in the "oral" than the "writing tradition" and that "influence anxieties" haunt or "inhabit writing, but not nearly so much the oral, logocentric tradition of prophetic speech." Bloom's appeal to the tradi- tion of cabalistic interpretation is in its own way a restaging of this assertion against the strength of Derrida, a declaration that even deconstruction had its precursor and that the history of cabala was indeed the re-writing of rhetoric that adequately accounts for the priority of voice, self, and psyche in critical or interpretative discourse. Edward Said, in a recently published interview, has applauded the thrust of Bloom's criticism, though with the regret that he tries too hard to accommodate and acclimate the latest antithetical modes- Derrida's "positions," for example. But Bloom's criticism cannot avoid this engagement; it is the self-fulfilling prophecy of askesis . He can only resist his contemporaries by resituating their thought in a history</page><page sequence="10">998 THE GEORGIA REVIEW to which they are blind. And the risk, which Bloom well knows, is that his own system must repeat the belated crisis of modern poetry in its efforts to overcome nihilism, to produce, like Wallace Stevens, some "final yes" on the other side of the "mortal no," thereby transuming nihilism into another (de-idealized) Transcenden- talism. Bloom's system, therefore, is condemned to repeat what he calls in Stevens the "rich philosophical confusion" of the "native strain of our poetry." Bloom reduplicates the heroic individualism of the American tradition, while acknowledging the supreme fiction of such individualism. He aptly portrays himself, as a son of the cabalistic tradition, as the critic in "exile," the last defender of a hermeneutical tradition which he knows to be, in Stevens' definition of modern belief, a belated resistance to our knowledge that it dis- guises a "lie," a fiction, there being nothing else. Kabbalah and Poetry and Repression exemplify this curious role of the critic as traditionalist in exile. Kabbalah , indeed, is a concen- trated prose poem of interpretative exile, conducted very consciously in the arcane language which characterizes heuristic invention, the myth of system emerging from confusion. Bloom recurs to the Lurianic model of A Map of Misreading , only this time to provide Luria's cabala with its own history of belatedness. The tradition of cabala is interpreted (misread) by Bloom as a skewed history of interpretation which provides us with a figurative starting point for modern rhetoric while revealing that interpretation has its beginning (already always) in exile, that its beginning is always marked by a fall and hence by a lack of access to anv master or sacred text. The early Kabbalah, according to Bloom, is of Provençal origin; it emerged out of a system of Jewish esotericism, and thus out of the "Oral Law" (a point significant for Bloom's reversal of écriture ). But it eventually became a "body of rhetoric, or figurative language" and even a "theory of rhetoric" as it became enciphered. For Bloom cabalistic writing has a dualistic historv, derived from the incompatible traditions of Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism. It is an already belated interpretation of two modes of interpretation. Whether or not this is a "true" history, or only a Bloomian con- fusion, is of no real moment. The crucial point is irresistible: that like all theories of language it harbors an internal contradiction, and bespeaks the impossible mediation between the divine and the human even as it attempts a figurai bridge of the abyss. The writing of Isaac Luria, the "second or modern Kabbalah," is already a revisionist version of "classical" cabala, the latter having its affinities with Neo-Platonist philosophy, the former with Gnosticism. Modern cabala, then, is already a radical tropin^ of an earlier interpretation, a text in which the origin or the Oral Law is already forever distanced and marked by obscure traces. The modern cabala is an authoritative,</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 999 systematic commentary, not on the Law but on the historical inscrip- tion of it. Moreover, Lurianic history, as Bloom argues, is tied to a modern event, a second Jewish exile, this time from Spain in 1492. (It is, of course, the momentous date of another beginning, another exile's quest which will issue into the American tradition. Bloom's figure for both poetry and criticism is quest, as well as questioning.) The lesson of cabala, for Bloom, lies in its systematic emptying out of the idea of the origin, and the Gnostic supplemen- tation of the vision of presence with the notion of absence as "apparent being." It is "negative theology," a dialectical mode which Bloom opposes to the deconstructive questioning of dialectics and historicism. The shrewdness of Bloom's rhetorical maneuver is apparent if we remember that he is intent on showing that modern critical decentering is only a belated repetition, and that the idea of origin, of the poem as a presence, of the originality of authorship, belongs not only to western metaphysics or onto-theology but inhabits all language and marks it as poetic through and through. This alliance of theological language, rhetoric, and poetic language is Bloom's Vichian forestructuring of criticism. Bloom's appeal to Luria is in its way a strategic interpretation of a son's system of defense against the idea of absence, that death which doubly defines his role, his displacement of the father and his own fate as successor to the father. Bloom understands that if metaphysics is a study of death, poetry is life only in the sense that it is a repression and transumption of the idea of absence. It is a fiction of identity, of duration. Poetry is a form of genealogical revisionism in which, to use Stevens' phrase, the "son restores the father" by turning him into a fiction. In poetry the father's power is inexhaustible. An appropriation of cabala, then, does more than resupply Bloom's fund of tropes, thereby complicating the problem for those who would enter the dédale of his map. Zimzum , tikkun , etc., implicate and complicate rhetoric in a "modern" theology. In one sense this rhetoric marks the limits of the "white mythology" which Frye's "anatomy" or Abrams' "natural supernaturalism" purveys. Yet, it only elaborates the net of onto-theology. The rupture between classical and modern, between Neo-Platonic and Gnostic cabala, is the fiction or false rupture that marks the alleged differences between eastern and western thought. "Gnosis and Kabbalah. . . were the first Modernisms," Bloom argues, and therefore an inaugural and pure form of deconstruction, a negative theology. Gnostic cabalism is the mark of the simultaneous excess and lack in western thought, of the rhetorical ground of that thought. But what is the "modern" as interpreted by Bloom? It is the crisis, as Derrida has described it, of "two interpretations of inter- pretation," the one forever excluding the other, each one marking</page><page sequence="12">I ООО THE GEORGIA REVIEW the limits of the other. Bloom tries not to have to choose between the two; he believes he can overcome de Man's aporia, that he can master aporia and therefore master his siblings. But let's recall Derrida's two interpretations. If modernism is characterized by the acknowledg- ment of the absence of origins, there nevertheless remains, says Derrida, a choice and exclusion, which is really no choice at all. He calls the two interpretations Rousseauistic and Nietzschean, since they have no proper name; we might call them Romantic and Modern, since Romantic is no less contemporary than Modern. The names thus name a double-bind. If Rousseauistic interpretation recognizes the myth of origins, it still "seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering, a truth or an origin which is free from freeplay and from the order of the sign, and lives like an exile the necessity of interpretation." Bloom's interpretation is as vigorous an attack upon the poetics of presence as is Derrida's deconstruction. But his acknowledgment of "broken immediateness" resists Nietzschean joy, or interpretation without bottom. Behind the order of the sign there remains the fiction, the figuration of the "self." The bottomlessness of interpreta- tion is grounded in the "scene of instruction." There remains in Bloom, despite his protests, what Derrida calls the "ethic of presence, that ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self-presence in speech" that resounds in the model of structuralist interpretation. In A Map of Misreading , Bloom confesses to his nostaliga for a will to power over the text: "Though I am myself an uneasy quester after lost meanings, I still conclude that I favor a kind of interpretation that seeks to restore and redress meaning, rather than primarily to decon- struct meaning," that being the difference between Nietzschean de- centering and Emersonian re-centering: an "American mode of interpretation, one that we have begun- but only begun- to develop, from Whitman and Peirce down to Stevens and Kenneth Burke; a mode that is intertextual, but that stubbornly remains logocentric, and that still follows Emerson in valorizing eloquence, the inspired voice, over the scene of writing." This refutation simply ignores Derrida's patient undermining of the rhetoric of logocentrism. In Poetry and Repression Bloom again renews his attack on deconstruction, and once again by arguing for the historical precedent of cabala as a master text of interpretation. Like A Map of Misreading , this text is more significant for its practical criticism than for its theory. Indeed, Poetry and Repression relates to Kabbalah and Criticism as A Map of Misreading relates to The Anxiety of Influence, or theory to practice- in the sense also that such evident margins are ultimately blurred by the assumptions of Bloom's poetics. Poetry and Repression rehearses the argument for Gnostic cabalism as the exemplary modernist text, a text expounded</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS I OO I and prolonged in the modern analytics of Vico and his contemporary avatar, Kenneth Burke, another of Bloom's heuristic genealogies. But the text begins with an even more revealing strategy- with the "map" as a kind of epigraph and a quotation from Derrida that is rhetorically turned against itself: Jacques Derrida asks a central question in his essay on Freud and the Scene of Writing: "What is a text, and what must the psyche be if it can be represented by a text?" My narrower concern with poetry prompts the contrary question: "What is a psyche, and what must a text be if it can be represented by a psyche?" Both Derrida's question and my own require exploration of three terms: "psyche," "text," "represented." Derrida's three terms derive from questions opened up by Freud's self-questioning of psychoanalytic metaphors, particularly the relation of dream imagery to psychical content, and the Freudian invocation of models borrowed from script writing to articulate this relation of psyche to text. Psychoanalysis enters the linguistic problematic, or in Freud's case, poses to itself a question classical philosophy has generally repressed. It is a question of representation, of the orderly movement between "reason and experience, perception and memory" as regulated by the "scriptural image." The orderly displacement from experience or reality to figure, from content to text, is retraced to an origin, the "psyche," which turns out to be itself metaphorical, another trace. If psyche is a reality or ground, the unrepresented, it is known only as it is displaced in language, as represented, thus as a "text." Psyche therefore belongs only to the order of the sign. Derrida does not ask "what is a psyche?" but "what is a text?" The question of "psyche" is what it "must" be "if it can be represented by a text." The name of the origin (psyche) always dissolves in its representation, in the deferred presence of the representation, and in the machinery of representation, the "text," which is never more or less than a model. We must remember that Derrida's question is posed at the beginning of an essay which deconstructs the philo- sophical predispositions of psychoanalysis. Like his more recent piece, "Le Facteur de la vérité," Derrida's decipherment of the "scene of writing" erases the margin between literature and philosophy in the same gesture by which it reveals how psychoanalysis seizes literature as the model or text of some revealed "truth." Derrida's question is irreversible. Bloom's substitution of terms re-poses the question of origins which in Derrida's formulation cannot even be properly asked. Without contesting Derrida, Bloom would say that it can only be asked in poetry, which hardly asks any other question or makes any other quest, even when it repeatedly confesses that the name of the origin is only symbolic, a displaced trope:</page><page sequence="14">I002 THE GEORGIA REVIEW "To be in the body, according to Vico, is to suffer a condition in which we are ignorant of causation and of origins, yet still we are very much in quest of origins." For Derrida the "text" is always a conditional problem; it is therefore the condition of the "psyche." Bloom's question restores the poetic fiction of an "authentic" or original force, the psychic origin of the text. It prefigures a proper representation even when that representation is a misrepresentation, or misprision, of another poetic text. "A poetic 'text'," Bloom writes, ". . . is not a gathering of signs on a page, but a psychic battlefield upon which authentic forces struggle for the only victory worth winning, the divinating triumph over oblivion. . (my italics). Bloom suppresses the question of writing, only to rephrase it as a question of rhetorical appropriation. The "psyche" is only a figure or trope, and it is represented only by a conflicting or antithetical trope. Poetry for Bloom is a "textual usurpation" of one poem by another, a successful "canonizing [of] one text as opposed to a rival text," an "act of imposition, a declaration of property that is made figura- tively rather than properly or literally." Hartman was correct- Bloom's theory is supermimetic; Derrida's antimimetic. In the latter, representation is an inescapable condition, and unrealizable; in the former, it is intolerable. Bloom's question, despite his concession to the irreducible rhetori- city of all language, remains well within the metaphysical structure of psycho-analytics (or as he might wish, psychoaesthetics). As such Bloom engages head on the aporia which de Man reveals to be the double-bind of all deconstruction. Nietzsche's questioning of the subject, of the doer or thinker always posed behind the deed or thought, has left the "psyche" as no more than a trope or the figure of the origin of figure. It is therefore the "name" for that which wills its return, its being, as the overcoming of absence or death. The evidence of all rhetoric, for Bloom at least, is its resistance to oblivion, its marking of a "stance." Bloom accepts the rhetorical dispersal of the subject or origin and therefore the classical sense of representation. The evidence of "trope" is not what it represents, a real force or subject or will, but what it mis-represents or deviates from, that is, another trope or text. A stance is the figure of chiasmus, of a difference or deviation, a crossing or beginning again considered as an inaugural or originating event. Thus Bloom preserves, in an act he calls transumption, the Romantic ground of the "self" or the "will." The "will" (see the essays called "Poetic Crossing" in the preceding and current issues of this journal) is itself only a trope: "the trope is a figure of will, rather than a figure of knowledge." Trope is persuasion, the sign of a deviation and a displacement. Bloom accepts de Man's reading of Nietzsche's rhetoric. But he desires to overmaster the aporia. If trope no longer represents truth (is not</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS 1003 knowledge), it is the evidence of duration, signified by the appro- priation or per-suasion of one figure by another, one poem by another. De Man's reading of Nietzsche uncovers the double-bind that precludes philosophy's access to "truth" and condemns it to a certain literariness, a metaphorical circularity, and thus to the inauthentic uses of fiction, similar to oratorical deception. But rather than following de Man into the labyrinths of this analysis, which argues that literature or performative language (rhetoric as persua- sion) can only bring into question its own performance, by trying to weave a "supreme fiction" or authenticity out of trope, Bloom takes the Vico road of rhetoric. Vico and his successors, Bloom argues, repeat the inventions of cabala, the invention of modern rhetoric. Bloom follows Vico in celebrating the poetic advent of man, who invents himself through a linguistic resistance. Language is generated out of fear and ignorance, thus inscribing the figurai event (like a "fall" or a "flood") that marks man's historical belated- ness, his unnaturalness. For Bloom as for Vico, all beginnings are poetic, or beginnings again within poetic language, the signature of an identity (man) turning from non-identity (nature). The Vichian fiction of man's historical beginning yields two in- compatible interpretations, as Bloom knows. One interpretation is the curse of "retroactive meaningfulness" (Bloom's translation of Freud's Nachträglichkeit ), and thus of "creative envy," of a loss sublimated and turned into a belated victory, into an original representation which displaces its model, the representation which overcomes the figure it represents. The other interpretation has been eloquently argued in Edward Said's recent study, Beginnings , which stresses the Vichian exculpation of man from the guilt of his historical fall, reading in Vico the myth of man's freedom from the guilt of lost origins and the authority of a "dynastic text" or master Word. Bloom, indeed, finds a similar interpretation of this absolute rupture between language and the divine in Gnostic cabala, which he of course views as the precursor of Emerson's doctrine of self-reliance. Nevertheless, this freedom from origins provokes in Bloom another antithetical interpretation. We might call it a nostalgia for the "word," manifest in the consummate "repression" of poetic language. Thus language (which is primordially poetic language, or trope) originates as a defense against the irreducible illogic of any "first" event, that is, against the idea of any original troping, or catastrophe, that launches man toward death. Said's Vico thrusts man fully into history, com- munity, and thus into a world of multiple secular authorship. It frees him from the tyranny of the past. Bloom's author lingers upon the catastrophe of íost origins, and on the double sense of trope (will, psyche, etc.). Authority, for Bloom, remains always in the past, in the precursor text, and therefore in the figure of the father.</page><page sequence="16">I004 THE GEORGIA REVIEW But what is the "father"? The authority of the past, of the already figurai father or precursor text (which implies the trace of some original or "dynastic" text) does not reside in figurai language or trope, but in the conflict they signify and the future conflicts they pre-figure. The "father" is the invention of the figurative first poem, the invention of the "son." Thus the defense against the father, the troping of him, would be the originally sublime invention of him. If the father had not already existed in the beginning of language, he would have had to be invented. So far as Bloom can pre-figure this original catastrophe, it was a poem, an interpretation of some previous interpretation. The structure of poetry is temporal; it is already always genealogical. This is a defense against the unnameable origin, but no less a repetition of the already hypothetical invention of the myth of origins, as if that invention ever took place as a single generative event. Stevens, of course, has an appropriate adage: "Gene- alogy is the science of correcting other genealogists' mistakes." It always consists of resituating the father in his double role, as if at the origin, and thus of re-imagining the logocentric fiction. I previously suggested that Bloom's interpretation is "nostalgic," a particularly modern nostalgia, which reconceives the Romantic poem (or quest-romance) as a universal model which overmasters aporia and contains every tendency of deconstruction. This is not nostalgia for a lost meaning that can be recuperated, even in a fiction one knows not to be true. It is a nostalgia for power, a resistance to the modern sense of entropy or impotence. For it recognizes, belatedly, that the notion of power is always implicated with and contradicted by the notion of self. Thus Stevens' "first idea," which is so enticing to Bloom! The "first idea" is like, or simply is, a figuratively first poem, and includes the invention of time and death. It is the sign, in Stevens' phrase that "we live in a place/ That is not our own," exiles from the "muddy centre" which, alas, is also our own mythic invention. Thus as Yeats imagined, man has invented death, a con- figuration which pre-figures a power and authority in the signs of their defeat. Poetry invents both the loss of power and the purpose for it, the temporal quest for origins or the recovery of power- the double-bind of a desire to return to the father. The notion of self-identity, as a resistance to or sublimation of death, is nothing less than a deconstruction of the fiction of Unity or identity. It always involves the fiction of self-overcoming, as in Nietzsche's notion of "eternal recurrence." Nietzsche's reading of the Romantic fiction of the self is no less a deconstruction of the notion of death (of stability or non-difference) implicit in the original fiction of a "will to power," and it is intricately related to nineteenth-century reflections on the concept of entropy or cooling death. The fiction of "power" becomes the dream of power over the precursor or</page><page sequence="17">BOOK REVIEWS 1005 pre-text, over man's own inventions. But this notion of power is inscribed within the limits of a linguistic concept. The pre- cursor text which one misreads, or tropes, is always a contemporary text; that is, it is an old text that is misread into a position of authority so that it can be mastered, displaced. Power is always a contemporary relationship, a mark of quantitative difference. But it is always pre- figured as temporal or genealogical relationship, as transferable or recuperable, as in a present mastering of the past or future recupera- tion of a loss, the continuity of a son's displacement of the father. Bloom's dialectical theory, his repeated appeal to triadic models, is an attempt to restore continuity to the ruptures or discontinuities which deconstruction has revealed in the structure of that great genealogical poem, onto-theological metaphysics, to which that gene- alogy we call poetic or literary history is only a footnote. Canon-formation, which Bloom avows to be the sole purpose of any critical project, is nothing more than genealogical revisionism. But within Bloom's theory of intertextual conflict, every poem is a genealogical "map," a machine for reading, implicitly and explicitly, other texts. This means that every poem must reimagine the pre-text, and thus resituate the father it displaces. But the name of the father is also the repressed signature of the brother, the sibling, the rival poem, whose power is dispatched to its impotent though authoritative place in an archaic history. (One might very well consider the mutually exclusive canons preferred by Bloom and Hugh Kenner as a characteristic example of the illogical place of "authority" in modern critical debates. But the contrary positions of the so-called "Yale school," which curiously admits Derrida as a way of mastering him, or putting him in a proper antithetical place, that is, situating him in the genealogy of rhetorical criticism, is the more dramatic example. Derrida, or the deconstruction which he along with de Man represents, is the excess that distinguishes any genealogy, and marks its limits, predicating the nearly infinite revisions it permits.) Every new genealogy restores the anthropomorphic structure which each effort of deconstruction dismantles. Perhaps Bloom's theory can only be described as a "fiction," or as it were, a rhetorical poem that rewrites Borges' legendary "Library of Babel" in Stevensian metaphors. Out of a "mere labyrinth of letters," or that language which obsesses the poet with its priority, was invented the fiction of the Book. Which no sooner conceived (like a "general theory of the Library") is found to be missing, a presence mockingly signified as absent by every book and every letter that makes up all the books of a Library in which " there are no two identical books ." The Library, a totality that contains all books and therefore the language which offers all the possible com- binations out of which any future book will be made, produces a</page><page sequence="18">IOO 6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW delirium and a vertigo in those who seek the master text, the key. The origin of the Library, of totality, is also the origin of time. The vastness of the labyrinth, that "universe (which others call the Library)," produces a rash of contradictory theories, each of them regional and exclusionary, one of which is the great "superstition" of the "Man of the Book." (Like the myth of the "central man," one presumes.) This book is not a pure Word, but the model of a privileged interpretation, the "formula and perfect compendium of all the rest ." The legendary author of this legendary text is "analogous to a god." He was a priestly functionary, yet only a "librarian," who had glimpsed the sacred word and inscribed it. The search, as the fable weaves it, is always for this father-author, this privileged interpreter who has become the poet-prophet. Out of this superstition has been spun the fiction of a "regressive method," a pursuit of the "total book" that will confer godlike privilege on the interpreter. The first to get there will be the father's true successor. The fact of the book's existence is not a question. The fact that the fiction is not "unlikely," that it is "possible," is its existence: '"it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded." The fiction maintained by genealogical revision is the fiction of "writing," that the total book has been written and yet may again be written, for "the certitude that everything has been written negates us and turns us into phantoms." This is the rhetorical "passion for yes" that Bloom's criticism projects, in the face of a deconstructive theory of writing. "The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men," Borges' librarian writes. What it distracts him from is the nostalgia of belatedness, his discovery that "to speak is to fall into tautology." Bloom, like Borges, would offer us the "elegant hope" that the " Library is unlimited and cyclical": "If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order)." Stevens called him a "Connoisseur of Chaos." Bloom, who is under attack because he will not let us forget the dis-ease of criticism, should be praised rather for offering us once again the saving necessity of "tautology," that "legend" which poetry as well as criticism ceaselessly "represents." For after all, as Bloom's own "father" inscribed in a journal of 1899, "the best poetry will be rhetorical criticism" (Wallace Stevens). Joseph N.
